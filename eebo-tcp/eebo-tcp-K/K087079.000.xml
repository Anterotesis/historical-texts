            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS book is not addreſſed to you, in order to aſk your protection for its faults; or in hopes, that ſuch valuable names at the head of it, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. Things in print muſt ſtand by their own worth. But it is offered to you, to let the world ſee I had that confidence in the goodneſs of my deſign in writing it, as to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to ſuch great and impartial judges; and that I believe you will report your opinion in ſuch a manner, as to procure me the eſteem of the virtuous; when you find that my principal intention in this piece, is to ſerve the intereſts of truth, liberty, and religion, and to advance uſeful learning, to the beſt of my abilities: — that I have the happineſs of mankind at heart, and attempt, in a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical manner, to encreaſe their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in general; and in particular, to lead them to a pious contemplation and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of God's unſpeakable wiſdom and goodneſs manifeſted in the works of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; — ſhew them the truth of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0028500100:4"/>of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> concerning a divine providence, immortality, and a future ſtate; and that as virtue advances and improves, human felicity augments, and becomes a ſure prognoſtick of that fulneſs of bliſs, which men of goodneſs and integrity are to enjoy, without interruption, frailty, and infirmity, in an unchangeable and everlaſting life. This was my ſcheme. Theſe things I had princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in view, when, to vindicate my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from miſrepreſentation and idle ſtories, and to illuſtrate my <hi>memoirs of ſeveral ladies of Great-Britain,</hi> I ſat down to write a true hiſtory of my life and notions. You will ſee at once, gentlemen, that this is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored part of my work. Were I able to write ſo as to perſuade even a few to alter their way of living, and employ their time for the future, in forming and training up their moral powers to perfection, I ſhould think myſelf more fortunate and glorious than the greateſt genius in the temple of Fame. Indeed, gentlemen, fame or name, in this world, is not the thing I think of. <hi>Non eſt mortale quod opto,</hi> I can ſay with <hi>Lactantius:</hi> and were it within my power to chooſe, ſure I am, that I would be for ever unknown. But that was impoſſible. In juſtice to myſelf, as before obſerved, and that tradition might not hand me down, when I
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0028500100:5"/>am gone, in that variety of bad and fooliſh characters, which a malice, that knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of me, whiſpers while I am living; it was neceſſary I ſhould tell my own ſtory. The relation was likewiſe requiſite, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the memoirs before mentioned intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The volumes of that work, which are to be publiſhed, would be quite dark, and not ſo grateful as intended, without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious account of the author's life.</p>
            <p>This, gentlemen, is the truth of the caſe, and as I ſay as little of myſelf, in my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I can; and as much for true religion and uſeful learning, as I was able, I hope, from your rectitude and judgment, that you will get me a fair hearing; and I call upon you as my patrons, and the friends to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and truth, for your approbation of my good and pious intentions, tho' you ſhould not be able to ſay one word of any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies in my writings. This is all I aſk. As I wiſh well to your cauſe, the cauſe of virtue and letters, and have chiefly endeavoured, according to my abilities, to make my readers acquainted with the <hi>majeſty of the Deity, and his kingdom,</hi> and <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his excellency,</hi> before whom all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, all powers and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, are as nothing; I hope you will, in return, favour me with your beſt wiſhes.</p>
            <p>As to ſome ſtrange things you will find in the following journal; and a life, in various
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0028500100:6"/>particulars, quite contrary to the common courſe of action, I can aſſure you, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in reſpect of the ſtrange things, that however wonderful they may appear to you, yet they are; excluſive of a few decorations and figures, (neceſſary in all works), ſtrictly true: and as to the difference of my life, from that of the generality of men, let it only be conſidered, that I was born in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and carried an infant to Ireland, where I learned the Iriſh language, and became inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with its original inhabitants: — that I was not only a lover of books from the time I could ſpell them to this hour; but read with an extraordinary pleaſure, before I was twenty, the works of ſeveral of the fathers, and all the old romances; which tinged my ideas with a certain piety and extravagance, that rendered my virtues as well as my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections particularly mine: — that by hard meaſure, I was compelled to be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer, when very young, and had not a friend in the univerſe but what I could make by good fortune, and my own addreſs: — that my wandering life, wrong conduct, and the iniquity of my kind, with a paſſion for extraordinary things and places, brought me into ſeveral great diſtreſſes; and that I had quicker and more wonderful deliverances from them than people in tribulation gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally receive: — that the dull, the formal, and the viſionary, the hard-honeſt man, and
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0028500100:7"/>the poor-liver, are a people I have had no connexion with; but have always kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the polite, the generous, the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the rational, and the brighteſt freethinkers of this age: — that beſide all this, I was in the days of my youth, one of the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive men in the world, at every exerciſe; and to a degree of raſhneſs, often venturous, when there was no neceſſity for running any hazards: in diebus illis, I have deſcended head-foremoſt from a high cliff into the ocean, to ſwim, when I could, and ought, to have gone off a rock not a yard from the ſurface of the deep. — I have ſwam near a mile and a half out in the ſea, to a ſhip that lay off, went on board, got clothes from the mate of the veſſel, and proceeded with them to the next port; while my companion I left on the beach concluded me drowned, and related my ſad fate in the town.—I have taken a cool thruſt over a bottle, without the leaſt animoſity on either ſide; but both of us depending on our ſkill in the ſmall ſword, for preſervation from miſchief. — Such things as theſe I now call wrong, and mention them only as ſamples of a raſhneſs I was once ſubject to, as an opportunity happened to come in the way. Let all theſe things be taken into the account, and I imagine, gentlemen, that what may at firſt ſight ſeem ſtrange, and next to incredible, will, on conſidering theſe particulars, not
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0028500100:8"/>long remain ſo, in your opinion; though you may think the relator an odd man. As to that, I have nothing to ſay. And if oddneſs conſiſts in ſpirit, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thought, and a zeal for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine unity; in a taſte for what is natural, antique, romantic, and wild; in honouring women, who are admirable for goodneſs, letters, and arts; and in thinking, after all the ſcenes I have gone through, that every thing here is vanity; except that <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> which gives us a right to <hi>expect beyond the grave;</hi> and procures us, in this world, the direction of infinite wiſdom, the protection of infinite power, and the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of infinite goodneſs; — then, may it be written on my ſtone,—<hi>Here lies an odd man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much, gentlemen, I thought proper to ſay to you, that by being acquainted with the particulars relative to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and deſign of the author, you might the eaſier and the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the various things you will find in the work he dedicates to you.</p>
            <p>I have only to add, that I wiſh you all happineſs; that your heads may lack no ointment, and your garments be always white and odoriferous: but eſpecially, may you preſs on, like true critics, towards perfection; and may bliſs, glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, be your reward and your Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p> About fifty years ago the Midwife wheeled me in, and much ſooner than half a Century hence, in all human probability, Death will wheel me out. When Heaven pleaſes, I am ſatisfied. Life and death are equally welcome, becauſe equally parts of my way to Eternity. My lot has been a ſwarthy one in this firſt State, and I am in hopes I ſhall exchange worlds to advantage. As God, without all peradventure, brought his moral creatures into being, in order to increaſe their Virtue, and provide ſuitable happineſs for the Worthy, the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate here may expect immutable felicity at laſt, if they have endeavoured, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what power they had, to render themſelves uſeful and valuable, by a ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and benevolence of temper, a diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedneſs,

               <p>For my part, I confeſs that, many have been the failings of my Life, and great the defects of my obedience. But in the midſt of all my failings and imperfections, my Soul hath always ſympathiſed with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and my heart hath ever aked for the miſeries of others. My hand has often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, when I wanted the ſhilling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſelf, and when it hath not been in my power to relieve, I have grieved for the ſcanty Accommodations of others. Many troubleſome and expenſive offices I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to do good to Men, and ever ſocial and free have I been in my demeanour, eaſy and ſmooth in my addreſs; and therefore, I truſt that, whenever I am removed from this horizon, it will be from a dark and cloudy ſtate, to that of joy, light, and full Revelation. This felicitates my every day, let what will happen from without. This ſupports me under every Affliction, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me to mentain a habit of ſatisfaction and joy in the general courſe of my Life.</p>

I had hardly a thought at that time of the fooliſh choiſes and purſuits of men; thoſe fatal choices and purſuits, which are owing to falſe judgments, and to a habit of acting precipitantly, without examining the fancies and appetites; and therefore, very rarely went into the pleaſures and diverſions which men of fortune in a Univerſity too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly indulge in. My relaxation, after ſtudy, was my german-flute, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of ſome ingenious, ſober friend; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, my private tutor, who was a bright and excellent man; and if the weather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I walked out into the country ſeveral miles. At this exerciſe, I had often one or other with me; but for the moſt part, was obliged to go alone. My dog and my gun however were diverſion enough on the way, and they frequently led me into ſcenes of entertainment, which laſted longer than the day. Some of them you will find in this Journal.

                  <label>Of Mr. Locke's Eſſay.</label> The firſt book I took into my hand,  after receiving my note of admiſſion, was the eſſay of that fine Genius, Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> and I was ſo pleaſed with this clear and accurate writer, that I looked into nothing elſe, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it three times over, I had made a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough acquaintance with my own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. He taught me to examine my abilities, and enabled me to ſee what objects my mind was fitted to deal with. He led me into the ſanctuary of vanity and ignorance, and ſhewed me how greatly true knowledge depended on a right meaning of words, and a juſt ſignificancy of expreſſion. In ſum, from the Eſſay my Underſtanding received very great benefits, and to it I owe what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement I have made in the reaſon given me. If I could, I would perſuade all young Gentlemen to read it over and over with great attention, and I am ſure they would find themſelves very richly rewarded for their pains in reading it. They would acquire that juſtneſs and truth of underſtanding, which is the great perfection of rational Beings.</p>

               <head>5. Natural Philoſophy.</head>
               <p> When I had done, for a time, with this admirable Eſſay, I then began to ſtudy the firſt principles of things, the ſtructure of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0028500100:22"/>the Univerſe, the contexture of human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the properties of beaſts, the virtues of plants, and the qualities of metals, and was quite charmed with the contemplation of the beautiful order, and wiſe final cauſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all her laws and productions. The ſtudy had a delightful influence on the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of my mind, and inſpired into it a love of order in my heart, and in my outward manners. It likewiſe led me to the great firſt Cauſe, and in repeated views of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, wiſdom and goodneſs in all the works of nature, rivited upon my mind a fixed conviction, that all is under the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a general Mind, as far remote from all malice as from all weakneſs, whether in reſpect of underſtanding or of power. This gave me a due affection towards the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect Parent of Nature, and as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated his glorious Works, I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in tranſports to confeſs, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved our love and admiration. This did alſo ſatisfy me, that whatever the order of the world produces, is in the main both juſt and good, and of conſequence, that we ought in the beſt manner to ſupport what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hardſhips are to be endured for virtue's ſake: that acquieſcence and complacency with reſpect to ill accidents, ill men and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, ought to be our part under a perfect adminiſtration; and with benignity and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0028500100:23"/>conſtancy we muſt ever act, if there be a ſettled perſuaſion, that all things are framed and governed by a univerſal mind. — Such was the effect the ſtudy of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy had upon my Soul. It ſet beyond all doubt before me the moral perfection of the Creator and Governor of the Univerſe. And if this Almighty God, I ſaid, is perfect Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Virtue, does it not follow, that he muſt approve and love thoſe who are at due pains to improve in wiſdom; — and what he loves and delights in, muſt he not make happy? This is an evident truth. It renders the cauſe of virtue quite triumphant.</p>

               <p> But upon Ethicks or Moral Philoſophy I dwelt the longeſt. This is the proper food of the Soul, and what perfects her in all the virtues and qualifications of a gentleman. This Science I collected in the firſt place from the antient ſages and philoſophers, and ſtudied all the moral writers of Greece and Rome. With great pleaſure I ſaw, that theſe immortal authors had delineated as far as human reaſon can go, that courſe of life which is moſt according to the intention of nature, and moſt happy; had ſhewn that this univerſe, and human nature in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, was formed by the wiſdom and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of a Deity, and that from the conſtitution of our nature various duties aroſe: — that ſince God is the original independent Being,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0028500100:24"/>compleat in all poſſible perfection, of bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs power, wiſdom and goodneſs; the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Contriver, and Governor of this world, to whom mankind are indebted for innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable benefits moſt gratuitouſly beſtowed; we ought to manifeſt the moſt ardent love and veneration toward the Deity, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him with affections of Soul ſuited to the pre-eminence and infinite grandeur of the original Cauſe of all; ought to obey him, as far as human weakneſs can go, and humbly ſubmit and reſign ourſelves and all our intereſts to his will; continually confide in his goodneſs, and conſtantly imitate him as far as our weak nature is capable. This is due to that original moſt gracious Power who formed us, and with a liberal hand ſupplies us with all things conducive to ſuch pleaſure and happineſs as our nature can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: — That in reſpect of mankind, our natural ſenſe of right and wrong points out to us the duties to be performed towards others, and the kind affections implanted by nature, excites us to the diſcharge of them: that by the law of our conſtitution and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, juſtice and benevolence are preſcribed; and aids and an intercourſe of mutual offices required, not only to ſecure our pleaſure and happineſs, but to preſerve ourſelves in ſafety and in life: that the law of nature, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right, forbids every inſtance of injuſtice,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0028500100:25"/>a violation of life, liberty, health, property; and the exerciſe of our honourable, kind powers, are not only a ſpring of vigorous efforts to do good to others, and thereby ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the common happineſs; but they really procure us a joy and peace, an inward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and external advantages; while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and malice, anger, hatred, envy, and revenge, are often matter of ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and contain nothing joyful, nothing glorious: In the greateſt affluence, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage men are miſerable: — that as to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the voice of reaſon declares, that we ought to employ our abilities and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in improving our minds to an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledge of nature in the ſciences; and by diligent meditation and obſervation, acquire that prudence, juſtice, temperance, and fortitude, which ſhould conſtantly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our lives: — That ſolid prudence, which abhors raſhneſs, inconſiderateneſs, a fooliſh ſelf-confidence, and craft, and under a high ſenſe of moral excellence, conſiders and does what is really advantageous in life: — That juſtice, which conſtantly regards the common intereſt, and in ſubſerviency to it, gives to each one whatever is due to him upon any natural claim: — That temperance, which reſtrains and regulates the lower ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and diſplays the grace and beauty of manners: — And that fortitude, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0028500100:26"/>repreſſes all vain and exceſſive fears, gives us a ſuperiority to all the external accidents of our mortal ſtate, and ſtrengthens the ſoul againſt all toils or dangers we may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to in diſcharge of our duty; as an early and painful death with virtue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is highly preferable to the longeſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious life, and no advantages can be compared in point of happineſs with the approbation of God, and of our own hearts.</p>
               <p>That if in this manner we live prepared for any honourable ſervices to God, our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and ourſelves, and practice <hi>piety</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, <hi>good-will</hi> toward men, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aim at our own perfection, then we may expect, notwithſtanding our being involved in manifold weakneſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of ſoul, that the divine goodneſs and clemency will have mercy on ſuch as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love him, and deſire to ſerve him with duty and gratitude; will be propitious and placable to the penitents, and all who exert their utmoſt endeavours in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of virtue: And ſince the perfection of virtue muſt conſtitute the ſupreme felicity of man, our efforts to attain it, muſt be effectual in obtaining compleat felicity, or at leaſt ſome lower degree of it.</p>

               <p> This beautiful, moral Philoſophy I found ſcattered in the wtitings of the old
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0028500100:27"/>theiſt philoſophers, and with great pains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the various leſſons to a ſyſtem of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and virtuous offices: but this I knew was what the majority of mankind were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of doing; and if they could do it, I ſaw it was far inferior to revelation. Every Sunday I appropriated to the ſtudy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled Religion, and perceived as I read the ſacred records, that the Works of Plato, and Cicero, and Epictetus, and all the uninſpired ſages of antiquity, were but weak rules in reſpect of the divine oracles. It is the mercy and power of God in the triumphs of grace, that reſtores mankind from the bondage and ignorance of idolatry. To this the ſinner owes the converſion of his ſoul. It is the ſtatutes of the Lord that rejoyce the heart, and enlighten the eyes. What are all the reaſonings of the philoſophers to the melody of that heavenly voice which crys continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Come unto me all ye that travel and are heavy laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> — And what could their leſſons avail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe expreſs promiſes of grace and ſpiritual aſſiſtance, which the blood of the new covenant confirms to mankind? The philoſophy of Greece and Rome was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the times and men: but it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no compariſon with the divine leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our holy religion, and the charter of God's pardon granted to us by his bleſſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0028500100:28"/>Son. Beſide, the philoſophers were in ſome degree dark and doubtful in reſpect of death and futurity; and in relation to this world, there is not a power in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, to preſerve us from being undone by allurements, in the midſt of plenty, and to ſecure our peace againſt the caſualties of fortune, and the torments of diſappointments; to ſave us from the cares and ſollicitudes which attend upon large poſſeſſions, and give us a mind capable of reliſhing the good things before us; to make us eaſy and ſatisfied as to the preſent, and render us ſecure and void of fear as to the future. Theſe things we learn from revelation, and are informed by the ſacred records only, that if we are placed here in the midſt of many fears and ſorrows, and are often perplexed with evils in this world; yet they are ſo many warnings not to ſet up our reſt here, but to keep a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt eye upon the things <hi>which God has prepared for thoſe who love him.</hi> It is the goſpel informs us, there is another ſcene prepared for the moral world, and that juſtice only waits to ſee the full proof of the righteouſneſs, or unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men: that that ſcene will open with the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, and we ſhall either receive glory and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, if we have obeyed the calls of grace
<pb facs="tcp:0028500100:29"/>to virtue and holineſs; — or, be doomed to the moſt dreadful miſeries, if we reject the counſel of God, and live quite thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the great concerns of eternity. Theſe conſiderations made me prefer reveled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the beginning of my rational life. The morality of the antient philoſophers I admired. With delight I ſtudied their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and received, I gratefully confeſs, much improvement from them. But the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our bleſſed Lord I declared for, and look on the promiſed Meſſiah as the moſt conſummate bleſſing God could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, or man receive. God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities. And would men but hear and obey this life-giving Redeemer, his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel would reſtore reaſon and religion to their rightful authority over mankind; and make all virtue, and true goodneſs, flouriſh in the earth.</p>

               <p> But I muſt obſerve that, by the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the New Teſtament, I do not mean any of thoſe modern ſchemes of religion, which diſcover the evident marks and ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuperſtition and enthuſiaſm, or of knavery and impoſture; thoſe ſyſtems which even miracles cannot prove to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the pieties are abſurd, inconſiſtent and contradictory. The notions that are not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0028500100:30"/>characterized by the reaſon of things, and the moral fitneſs of actions, I conſidered as repugnant to the veracity, wiſdom, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Almighty, and concluded, that that only could be chriſtian religion, which beared the viſible marks and ſignatures of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, ſocial happineſs, and moral fitneſs, and was brought down from heaven to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct mankind in the worſhip of One eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, and bring them to repentance, and amendment of life. This was the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion I found in my Bible. I ſaw with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as I thoughtfully went through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pages, that natural religion is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ſupport of revelation; — ſupplies the defects of nature, but never attempts to overthrow the eſtabliſhed principles of it; —caſts new light upon the dictates of reaſon, but never overthrows them. <hi>Pure theiſm,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>appointed Mediator, Advocate,</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> by a commiſſion from God the Father, to me appeared to be the Goſpel;— and the directions of the holy Spirit, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in one ſupreme independent firſt cauſe, and worſhip in ſpirit and truth this one God and Father of All, in the name of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; as the diſciples of the Meſſiah; to copy after the life of our bleſſed Saviour, and to the utmoſt of our abilities, obey all his commands.—This was the religion I found in the writings of the apoſtles, and I then

               <head>10. Method of reading Hiſtory.</head>
               <p> In reading hiſtory, (my laſt years prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal employment, during my reſidence in college), I began with the beſt writers of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient hiſtory and ended with modern times, epochs, centuries, ages; the extent of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0028500100:32"/>kingdoms, common-wealths; their progreſs, revolutions, changes and declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the number, order, and qualities of the Princes, that have reigned over thoſe ſtates and kingdoms, their actions military and civil; the characters and actions of the great men that flouriſhed under them; and the laws, the arts, learning and manners, I carefully marked down, and obſerved not only how the firſt governments were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what the progreſs was of induſtry and property, which may be called the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerative principle of empire.</p>
               <p>When I had done with antient Hiſtory, I ſat down to the beſt modern ſtories I could get, and read of diſtant nations before I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtudy my country's conſtitution, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and laws. When I had finiſhed the hiſtories of France, and Spain, and Italy, and Germany, and many more, then I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Great-Britain, and in the firſt place took a view of the Engliſh conſtitution and government, in the antient books of the common law, and ſome more modern wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who out of them have given an account of this government. From thence I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to our Hiſtory, and with it joined in every King's reign the laws then made. This gave me an inſight into the reaſon of our ſtatutes, and ſhewed me the true ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they came to be made, and what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0028500100:33"/>weight they ought to have. By this means, I read the hiſtory of my country with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and was able to examine into the excellence or defects of its government, and to judge of the fitneſs or unfitneſs of its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and laws. By this method I did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe know enough of the law for an Engliſh gentleman, tho' quite ignorant of the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, or wrangling and captious part of the law, and was well acquainted with the true meaſure of right and wrong.

This is true magnanimity: And he alone can be truly happy, as well as truly great, who can look down with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous contempt upon every thing that would tempt him to recede in the ſmalleſt degree from the paths of rigid honeſty, candour and veracity.</p>

                  <l>Then I reſume the freedom which I gave,</l>
                  <l>Still thou art bound to vice, and ſtill a ſlave.</l>
                  <l>Thou canſt not wag thy finger, or begin</l>

                  <l>No, friend; not fuming gums, nor ſacrifice,</l>
                  <l>Can ever make a madman free, or wiſe.</l>
                  <l>Virtue and vice are never in one ſoul:</l>

               <p>This is the great leſſon, that virtue alone is true honour, true freedom, and ſolid, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable happineſs. It is indeed its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. There are no ſatisfactions equal to, or comparable with virtuous, rational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; nor can virtuous diſpoſitions, and well improved moral powers be rewarded, or receive happineſs ſuited to their nature, but from their exerciſes and employments about proper objects. And as virtue gives pleaſure here in proportion to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it makes, far beyond all that mere ſenſe can yield, in the moſt advantageous circumſtances of outward enjoyment; ſo in a ſtate to come, it ſhall be ſo placed as its improvements require, that is, be placed in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that ſhall afford it buſineſs or employment proportioned to its capacity, and by means thereof the higheſt ſatisfaction. — Such a baſis for building moral inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon we find in hiſtory. We are warned in ſome pages to avoid the miſeries and wretchedneſs which many have fallen into by departing from reaſon or virtue: — And in others, we meet with ſuch virtuous characters and actions, as ſet forth the charms
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0028500100:37"/>of integrity in their full luſtre, and prove that virtue is the ſupreme beauty, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme charm: that in keeping the precepts of moral rectitude, we ſecure a preſent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and reward; and have a preſage of thoſe higher rewards which await a ſteady courſe of right conduct in another world.— <hi>Glorious, natural virtue!</hi> Would mankind but hearken to its voice, and obey its dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, there would be no ſuch Beings as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, Delinquents,</hi> and <hi>Traitors,</hi> in this lower world. The ſocial inclinations and diſpoſitions would for ever prevail over the ſelfiſh appetites and paſſions. The law of benevolence would be the rule of life. The advancement of the common good would be the work of every man.</p>

               <head>12. A Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</head>
               <p> The caſe however is; that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of mankind are too corrupt, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the great univerſal law of ſocial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to gratify ambition, avarice, and the like, employ a cunning or power, to ſeize the natural rights and properties of others: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>to natural virtue grounded on the reaſon and fitneſs of things, in themſelves,</hi> the firſt and principal mean of ſecuring the peace and happineſs of ſociety, it was neceſſary to add two other grand principles, <hi>civil government</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo have three conducible means to ſocial happineſs. Theſe three are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being of a publick, and of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0028500100:38"/>them, religion as I take it, is of the firſt conſequence; for the choice few on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind a <hi>natural Virtue,</hi> or benevolence flowing from the reaſon, nature, and fitneſs of things; and <hi>civil government</hi> cannot always ſecure the happineſ of mankind in particular caſes: but <hi>Religion,</hi> rightly underſtood, and fixed upon its true and proper foundation, might do the work, in conjunction with the other two principles, and ſecure the happineſs of Society. If mankind were brought to the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>one only true God,</hi> and to a <hi>ſincere obedience to his Will,</hi> as we have it diſcovered in <hi>Revelation,</hi> I think, appetite and paſſion would ceaſe to invade by violence or fraud, or ſet up for private intereſt in oppoſition to the publick ſtock or common good. But, alas! Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſo far from being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that it is rendered by ſome explainers the moſt doubtful and diſputable thing in the world. They have given it more phaſes than the moon, and made it every thing, and nothing, while they are ſcreaming or forcing the people into their ſeveral factions. This deſtroys the moment of Religion, and the multitude are thereby wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into endleſs mazes and perplexities, and rendered a hairing, ſtaring, wrathful rabble; inſtead of being transformed into ſuch chriſtians as filled the firſt church at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0028500100:39"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> chriſtians who acknowledged and worſhipped God the Father Almighty, in the name of Chriſt, that is, under a belief of that <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> which the Father of the Univerſe has, for the <hi>good</hi> of mankind, conferred upon him; and in <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>meekneſs,</hi> in <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> in a <hi>renunciation of the ſpirit, wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>honours of this world,</hi> in a <hi>love of God,</hi> and <hi>deſire of doing God's will,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking only his honour,</hi> were by the Goſpel made <hi>like unto Chriſt. Golden Religion! Golden Age!</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſtianity was then a <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of <hi>true Religion:</hi> the <hi>practice</hi> of Chriſtianity, a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of human Nature.</hi> But now, alas! too many explainers are employed in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and making doubtful the reveled Will of God, and by paraphraſes, expoſitions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, notes, and gloſſes, have almoſt rendered revelation uſeleſs. What do we ſee in the vaſt territories of Popery, but a perfect <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboliſm</hi> in the place of the religion of our Lord; doctrines the moſt impious and abſurd, the moſt inconſiſtent and contradictory in themſelves, the moſt hurtful and miſchievous in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; the whole ſupported by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ſophiſtry of learned knaves, and the tricks of jugling prieſts? And if we turn our eyes from theſe regions of <hi>impoſture</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> to the realms of <hi>proteſtants,</hi> do we not find ſome learned chriſtian crities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0028500100:40"/>reducing the inſpired writings to a dark ſcience? without regard to the nature and intrinſick character of their doctrines, do they not advance notions as true and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, which have not one appearance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority; but, on the contrary, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate with the reaſon of things, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fitneſs of actions; and are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain and clear, free from all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ambiguity, and ſuited to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and capacity of men, that the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them renders ſuch pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of little ſervice; and impeaches the veracity, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God? Alas! too many explainers are clamorous, under the infallible ſtrength of their own perſuaſions, and exert every power to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man us into believers. How the <hi>apoſtles</hi> argued for the great excellency and dignity of Chriſtianity is not with them the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; ſo far as I am able to judge from their learned writings; but the <hi>fathers,</hi> and our ſpiritual <hi>ſuperiors</hi> have put upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings the proper explications; and we muſt receive the truth as they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe it to us. This is not right, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. I own it does not ſeem to anſwer the end of the Meſſiah's coming, which was to reſtore <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to their rightful authority over mankind; and to make all virtue, and true goodneſs, flouriſh in the earth; the moſt perfect bleſſing to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0028500100:41"/>be ſure that God could beſtow on man, or man receive from God. This bleſſing we muſt miſs, if human authority is to pin us down to what it pleaſes to call ſenſe of ſcripture, and will ſet up the judgment of fallible men as the teſt of Chriſtianity. The Chriſtian Laity are miſerable indeed, if they be put under an obligation to find <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>truth</hi> which is taught by theſe Leaders. In truth, we ſhould be unhappy men, with a revelation in our churches and our cloſets, if the leaders had a right to make their <hi>own faith</hi> paſs for the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> or, if we refuſed it, might lance the weapons of this world at their people. What muſt we do then as true Chriſtians? I think for my ſelf, that we ought to form our judgment, in matters of faith, upon a ſtrict, ſerious and impartial examination of the Holy Scriptures, without any regard to the judgment of others, or human authority whatever: that we ought to open the ſacred records, without minding any ſyſtems, and from the reveled word of God learn that, Chriſtianity does not conſiſt in a jingle of unintelligible ſounds, and new fundamentals, hewn out by craft, enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, or bigotry, and maintained with an outrage of uncharitable zeal, which delivers Chriſtians to the flames of an eternal hell: but that, the heavenly religion of our Lord conſiſts in looking on the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0028500100:42"/>as the moſt conſummate bleſſing God could beſtow, or man receive; and that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is that <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> in acting according to the rules of the Goſpel, and in ſtudying to imitate God, who is the moſt perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding nature, in all his moral perfections; in becoming the <hi>Children of God</hi> by being (according to our capacity) <hi>perfect as he is perfect,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> as he is <hi>merciful;</hi> and in our whole <hi>moral</hi> behaviour as <hi>like</hi> to <hi>him</hi> as poſſible.</p>
               <p>In a word, to flee <hi>injuſtice, oppreſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, impurity, pride, unmercifulneſs, revenge:</hi> — to practiſe <hi>juſtice, piety, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, chaſtity, humility, beneficence, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability</hi> — to turn from our iniquities to the practice of all virtue: and through the <hi>alone mediation</hi> of the <hi>only-begotten Son of God, believe</hi> in and <hi>worſhip</hi> the <hi>eternal mind,</hi> the <hi>one ſupreme Spirit,</hi> in <hi>hope</hi> of a <hi>glorious immortality,</hi> through the ſanctification of the Holy Ghoſt: — Theſe are the things the Lord came down to teach mankind. For the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> itſelf then we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and look upon it as the <hi>only guide,</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> of faith. It is now the only deliverer of the <hi>declarations</hi> of our <hi>Lord:</hi> And the rule in our enquiry is, that every thing <hi>neceſſary to be believed</hi> by a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is in thoſe Books not left to be gathered by <hi>conſequences,</hi> or <hi>implications;</hi> but the things <hi>neceſſary</hi> to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0028500100:43"/>obtain the favor of God promiſed to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> are <hi>expreſsly declared.</hi> If this was not the caſe — if things <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> were not expreſſly proclaimed <hi>to be ſo,</hi> the goſpel revelation would be no rule at all 

<note n="(1)" place="bottom">
                     <p>To the plain and ſatisfactory method of ſeeking for the faith in the ſacred books, there are many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries and many objections raiſed. There are (ſays a great man) a very numerous body of Chriſtians who know no other guides but the living guides of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent church; and acknowledge no other <hi>faith,</hi> for the faith <hi>once delivered to the ſaints,</hi> but that which is <hi>now</hi> delivered to them by their <hi>preſent rulers,</hi> as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>To eſtabliſh this point, the greater part of theſe lay down the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the <hi>preſent</hi> church, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of the paſt ages, through whoſe mouth, or by whoſe hands, the preſent <hi>traditions</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to them. And this, indeed, would be a very good method, if that ſingle proof of <hi>infallibility</hi> could be proved. But this is a <hi>point</hi> ſo groſs, and ſo utterly void of all proof, that a great body of the <hi>Chriſtian world,</hi> have broke looſe from the power of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and declared for the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> itſelf, as the only <hi>guide</hi> or <hi>rule of faith;</hi> the only <hi>deliverer</hi> of the <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>us</hi> of later ages.</p>
                     <p>When this comes however to be put in practice, too many of the ſame perſons who ſet the ſcriptures up as the only guide, turn round on a ſudden, and let us know that they mean by it, not theſe ſacred original writings themſelves, but the <hi>interpretations,</hi> or <hi>ſenſe,</hi> put upon them by our ſpiritual <hi>ſuperiors,</hi> to which we are bound to ſubmit, and put under an obligation

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0028500100:44"/>

to find <hi>that</hi> to be the <hi>truth</hi> which is taught by theſe leaders.</p>
                     <p>But to this we reply with reaſon, that though we ought to pay a regard of ſerious attention to thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to find out and diſpenſe the truth, and ſhew the reſpect of a due examination of what they affirm; yet we muſt not yield the ſubmiſſion due only to <hi>infallibility.</hi> It is our glory not to ſubmit to the voice of any man. We muſt reſerve <hi>that</hi> regard, for <hi>God,</hi> and for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in matters of <hi>faith</hi> once <hi>delivered to the Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others, again, of the reformed, tell us, that the ſurer way of knowing what was <hi>delivered</hi> near eighteen hundred years ago, is to take the <hi>original</hi> faith from the <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> grave and good men, who met and writ for the ſettling of the <hi>faith.</hi> — And to this we anſwer, that theſe wiſe and good men cannot give ſo good an account of the <hi>faith</hi> contained in the <hi>original books</hi> as the <hi>books themſelves</hi> which contain it.</p>
                     <p>To give an example to the purpoſe. If we would know the doctrine of the Church of England at the reformation, it is not the writings of any particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, many years after that period, that we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; or any aſſembly of them; but the authentic acts, and declarations, and ſermons, made and recorded at the time; for many of the doctrines thought <hi>eſſential</hi> at the <hi>reformation,</hi> have been ſince changed by gradual alterations; — by explainers uſing their own ſtile and manner of expreſſion, and introducing their own ſcheme of philoſophy, and judgment in commenting, into the ſcheme of doctrine to be explained. This produces great variation from what was once ſettled. What was once eſteemed fundamental is thereby altered. — Let this be applied to the firſt Chriſtian writers, after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were departed,

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0028500100:45"/>

and as their <hi>language</hi> and philoſophy were <hi>various,</hi> and they differed from one another, great variations muſt creep into the doctrines delivered by them. It follows then, that nothing but what is recorded in the <hi>firſt original</hi> books themſelves can be firm and ſtable to us in points of <hi>faith.</hi> In the <hi>original books</hi> only we can find the <hi>faith,</hi> without that <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which human explications and additions have brought in by way of <hi>light.</hi>

               <head>13. The ſtory of Harriot Noel.</head>
               <p> But it is time to tell my reader the ſtory of the beautiful <hi>Harriot Noel,</hi> which I promiſed in my third memorandum. —
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0028500100:44"/>On the glorious firſt of Auguſt, before the beaſts were rouſed from their lodges, or the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0028500100:45"/>birds had ſoared upwards, to pour forth their morning harmony; while the mountains and the groves were overſhadowed by a dun obſcurity, and the dawn ſtill dappled the drowſy Eaſt with ſpots of grey; in ſhort, before the ſun was up, or, with his auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, began to animate inferior na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I left my chamber, and with my gun and dog, went out to wander over a pleaſant country. The different aſpects and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious points of view were charming, as the light in fleecy rings encreaſed; and when the whole flood of day deſcended, the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed early ſcene</hi> was a fine entertainment. Delighted with the beauties of this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I climbed up the mountains, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through many a valley. The game was plenty, and for full five hours, I journeyed onward, without knowing where I was going, or thinking of a return to college.</p>
               <p>About nine o'clock however I began to grow very hungry, and was looking round to ſee if I could diſcover any proper habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0028500100:46"/>to my purpoſe, when I obſerved in a valley, at ſome diſtance, ſomething that looked like a manſion. That way therefore I moved, and with no little difficulty, as I had a precipice to deſcend, or muſt go a mile round, to arrive at the place I wanted: down therefore I marched, got a fall by the way that had like to have deſtroyed me, and after all, found it to be a ſhed for cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The bottom however was very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and the ſides of the hills ſweetly copſed with little woods. The valley is ſo divided, that the riſing ſun gilds it on the right hand, and when declining, warms it on the left.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>— Veniens dextrum latus aſpiciat Sol,</l>
                  <l>Laevum diſcedens curru fugiente vaporet.</l>
               </q>
               <p>A pretty brook here likewiſe babbles along, and even <hi>Hebrus</hi> ſtrays not round <hi>Thrace</hi> with a purer and cooler ſtream.</p>
               <p>Fons etiam rivo dare nomen idoneus, ut nec Frigidior Thracam nec purior ambiat Hebrus.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A Country Seat.</label> In this ſweet and delicious ſolitude,  I crept on for ſome time, by the ſide of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring ſtream, and followed as it winded through the vale, till I came to a little har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick building, that had every charm and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0028500100:47"/>proportion architecture could give it. It was ſituated on a riſing ground in a broad part of the fruitful valley, and ſurrounded with a garden, that invited a penſive wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to roam in its delightful retreats, and walks amazingly beautiful. Every ſide of this fine ſpot was planted thick with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and kept ſo low, as not to prevent a proſpect to every pleaſing remote object.</p>
               <p>Finding one of the garden doors left open, I entred immediately, and to ſcreen my ſelf from the ſcorching beams of the ſun, got into an imbowered way, that led me to a large fountain, in a ring or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opening, and from thence, by a gradual, eaſy, ſhady aſcent, to a ſemicircular amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre of ever-greens, that was quite charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this were ſeveral ſeats for eaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, or retirement; and at either end of it a rotunda or temple of the Ionick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. One of them was converted into a grotto or ſhell-houſe, in which a politeneſs of fancy had produced and blended the greateſt beauties of nature and decoration. The other was a library, filled with the fineſt books, and a vaſt variety of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical inſtruments. Here I ſaw Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> ſitting, and ſo intent at writing, that ſhe did not take any notice of me, as I ſtood at the window, in aſtoniſhment looking at the things before me, and eſpecially at the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0028500100:48"/>amazing beauties of her face, and the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of her eyes; as ſhe raiſed them now and then from the paper ſhe writ on, to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Hebrew Bible, that lay open upon a ſmall deſk before her. The whole ſcene was ſo very uncommon, and ſo vaſtly amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I thought my ſelf for a while on ſome ſpot of magic ground, and almoſt doubted the reality of what my eyes beheld; till Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> by accident, looked full at me, and then came forward to the open window, to know who I wanted.</p>
               <p>Before I could anſwer, I found a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble old gentleman ſtanding by my ſide, and he ſeemed much more ſurprized at the ſight of me than his daughter was; for, as this young lady told me afterward, ſhe gueſſed at once the whole affair; ſeeing me with my gun and dog, in a ſhooting dreſs; and knew it was a natural curioſity brought me into the garden, and ſtoped me at the window, when I ſaw her in ſuch an attitude, and in ſuch a place. — This I aſſured them was the truth of my caſe, with this ſmall addition however, that I was ready to periſh for want of ſomething to eat; having been from four in the morning at hard exerciſe, and had not yet broke my faſt.— If this be the caſe, ſays the good old man, you are welcome, Sir, to Eden-Park, and you ſhall ſoon have the beſt breakfaſt our houſe affords.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0028500100:49"/>Upon this Mr. <hi>Noel</hi> brought me into his houſe, and the lovely <hi>Harriot</hi> made tea for me, and had ſuch plenty of fine cream, and extraordinary bread and butter ſet before me, that I breakfaſted with uncommon pleaſure. The honour and happineſs of her company rendered the repaſt quite delightful. There was a civility ſo very great in her manner, and a ſocial goodneſs ſo charming in her talk and temper, that it was unſpeakable delight to ſit at table with her. She aſked me a number of queſtions relating to things and books, and people, and there was ſo much good ſenſe in every inquiry, ſo much good humour in her reflections and replications, that I was intirely charmed with her mind; and loſt in admiration, when I contemplated the wonders of her face, and the beauties of her perſon.</p>
               <p>When breakfaſt was over, it was time for me to depart, and I made half a dozen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to riſe from my chair; but without her laying a roſy finger on me, this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maid had ſo totally ſubdued my ſoul, and deprived me of all motive power, that I ſat like the renowned Prince of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes, who was ſtiffened by inchantment in the apartment of the Princeſs <hi>Phedima,</hi> as we read in <hi>Amadis de Gaul.</hi> This Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> ſaw very plain, and in compaſſion to my misfortune, generouſly threw in a hint
<pb facs="tcp:0028500100:50"/>now and then, for a little farther converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to colour my unreaſonable delay. But this could not have been of ſervice much longer, as the clock had ſtruck twelve, if the old gentleman, her father, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us, and told me, he inſiſted on my ſtaying to dine with him; for he loved to take a glaſs after dinner with a facetious companion, and would be obliged to me for my company. At preſent (Mr. <hi>Noel</hi> continued) you will excuſe me, Sir, as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs engages me till we dine: but my daughter will chat the hours away with you, and ſhew you the curioſities of her library and grott. <hi>Harriot</hi> will ſupply my place.</p>
               <p>This was a delightful invitation indeed, and after returning my hearty thanks to the old gentleman for the favour he did me, I addreſſed my ſelf to Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> when her father was gone, and we were walking back to the library in the garden, and told her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, that tho' I could not be poſitive as to the ſituation of my ſoul, whether I was in love with her or not, as I never had experienced the paſſion before, nor knew what it was to admire a woman; having lived till that morning in a ſtate of indifference to her ſex; yet, I found very ſtrange emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within me, and I was ſure I could not leave her without the moſt lively and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting inquietude. You will pardon, I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0028500100:51"/>hope, Madam, this effuſion of my heart, and ſuffer me to demonſtrate by a thouſand and a thouſand actions, that I honour you in a manner unutterable, and from this time, can imagine no happineſs but with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Miſs Noel, in relation to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Adam, and the Primae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Hebrew Tongue.</label> Sir,  (this inimitable maid replied) you are an intire ſtranger to me, and to declare a paſſion on a few hours acquaintance, muſt be either to try my weakneſs, or becauſe you think a young woman is incapable of reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing but ſuch ſtuff, when alone in converſation with a gentleman. I beg then I may hear no more of this, and as I am ſure you can talk upon many more rational ſubjects, requeſt your favor, to give me your opinion on ſome articles in this <hi>Hebrew Bible</hi> you ſee lying open on the table in this room. My father, Sir, among other things he has taken great pains to inſtruct me in, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years that I have lived with him in a kind of ſolitary ſtate, ſince the death of my mother, whom I loſt when I was very young, has taught me to read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this inſpired <hi>Hebrew</hi> book; and ſays we muſt aſcribe <hi>primaevity</hi> and <hi>ſacred prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi> to this language. For my part, I have ſome doubts as to this matter, which I dare not mention to my father. Tell me, if you pleaſe, what you think of the thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0028500100:52"/>Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> (I anſwered) ſince it is your command, that I ſhould be ſilent as to that <hi>flame</hi> your glorious eyes and underſtanding have lighted up in my ſoul, like ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior nature, before whom I am nothing, ſilent I will be, and tell you what I fancy on a ſubject I am certain you underſtand much better than I do. My knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is but ſmall, tho' I have learned to read and underſtand the Old-Teſtament in the <hi>Ante-Babel</hi> language.</p>
               <p>My opinion on your queſtion is, that the <hi>Biblical Hebrew</hi> was the language of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and continued to be ſpoken by all men down to, and at the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> writing the pentateuch, and long after. <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho' bred in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> could converſe freely with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and the King of <hi>Gerar;</hi> nor do we find, that any variety of ſpeech interrupted the commerce of his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> with the ſeveral nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, or that it ever ſtopt <hi>Jacob</hi> in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. Nay, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in their journey through the deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> (after they had been ſome hundred years in <hi>Egypt</hi>) tho' joined by a mixt multitude, and meeting with divers kinds of people, had not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their language, and were eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, becauſe it was then the univerſal one. The ſimplicity and diſtinctneſs of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue preſerved its purity ſo long
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0028500100:53"/>and ſo univerſally. It could not well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate till the knowledge of nature was loſt, as its words conſiſt but of two or three letters, and are perfectly well ſuited to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſenſible and ſtrong ideas. It was at the <hi>captivity</hi>

This happened before our Lord 588 years; after the flood, 1766; of the world 3416.</p>

, in the ſpace of ſeventy years, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> by temporiſing with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant victors, ſo far neglected the uſage of their own tongue, that none but the <hi>ſcribes</hi> or learned men could underſtand <hi>Moſes</hi>'s books.</p>
               <p>This I confeſs (Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> ſaid) is a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible account of the <hi>primaevity</hi> and <hi>pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> of the <hi>ſacred Hebrew,</hi> but I think it is not neceſſary the account ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as fact. As to its being the language in Paradiſe, this is not very probable, as a compaſs of 1800 years muſt have changed the firſt language very greatly by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of words, and new inflections, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and conſtructions of them. The few firſt inhabitants of the earth were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in few things, and wanted not a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0028500100:54"/>variety of words; but when their deſcendants invented arts and improved ſciences, they were obliged to coin new words and technical terms, and by extending and transferring their words to new ſubjects, and uſing them figuratively, were forced to multiply the ſenſes of thoſe already in uſe. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to be ſure was thus gradually culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and every age improved it. All liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languages are liable to ſuch change. I therefore conclude, that the language which ſerved the <hi>firſt pair</hi> would not do for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations. It became vaſtly more copious and extenſive, when the numbers of mankind were great, and their language muſt ſerve converſation and the ends of life, and anſwer all the purpoſes of intelligence and correſpondence. New words and new terms of ſpeech, from time to time were neceſſary, to give true ideas of the things, actions, offices, places, and times peculiar to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Even Hutchinſon allows there was ſome coinage, ſome new words framed. We find in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prophets words not to be met with in the <hi>Pentateuch:</hi> and from thence we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed words unknown to <hi>Nimrod</hi> and <hi>Heber:</hi> and that the men at <hi>Shinaar</hi>

               <p>What you ſay, Madam, (I replyed) is not only very probable, but affords a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unexpected in a ſubject on which we are obliged, for want of <hi>data,</hi> to uſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures. I offer up to your ſuperior ſenſe the notion, that the Scriptures were wrote in the language of Paradiſe.

               <p>You force me to ſmile, (the illuſtrious Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> replyed) and oblige me to call you an odd compound of a man. Pray, Sir, let me have no more of thoſe romantic flights, and I will anſwer your queſtion as well as I can; but it muſt be at ſome other time. There is more to be ſaid on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at <hi>Babel,</hi> and its effects, than I could diſpatch between this and our hour of dining, and therefore, the remainder of our leiſure till dinner, we will paſs in a viſit to my grotto, and in walking round the garden to the parlour we came from. To the grotto then we went, and to the beſt of my power I will give my reader a deſcription of this ſplendid room.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miſs Noel's grotto.</label> In one of the fine rotunda's I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, at one end of the green amphitheatre very lately deſcribed, the ſhining apartment was formed. Miſs <hi>Noel</hi>'s hand had covered the floor with the moſt beautiful <hi>Moſaic</hi> my eyes have ever beheld, and filled the arched roof with the richeſt foſſil gems. The Moſaic painting on the ground was wrought with ſmall coloured ſtones or peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſharp pointed bits of glaſs, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0028500100:59"/>and proportioned together, ſo as to imitate in their aſſemblage the ſtrokes and colour of the objects, which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repreſent, and they repreſented by this lady's art, the <hi>Temple of Tranquillity,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Voluſenus</hi> in his dream.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Tranquility and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſcription.</label> At ſome diſtance the fine temple looks like a beautiful painted picture,  as do the birds, the beaſts, the trees, in the fields about it, and the river which murmurs at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the riſing ground; Amnis lucidus &amp; vadoſus in quo cernere erat varii generis piſces colludere. So wonderfully did this genius perform the piece, that fiſhes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds ſeem to take their paſstime in the bright ſtream. But above all, is the image of the philoſopher, at the entrance of the temple, vaſtly fine. With pebbles and ſcraps of glaſs, all the beauties and graces are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, which the pencil of an able artiſt could beſtow on the picture of <hi>Democritus.</hi> You ſee him as <hi>Diogenes Ldertius</hi> has drawn him, with a philoſophical joy in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that ſhews him ſuperior to all events. <hi>Summum bonorum finem ſtatuit eſſe laetitiam,</hi> non eam quae ſit eadem voluptati, ſed <hi>eam per quam animus degit perturbationis expers;</hi> and with a finger, he points to the following golden inſcription on the portico of the temple:—
<q>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0028500100:60"/>Flagrans ſit ſtudium bene merendi de ſeipſo, Et ſeipſum perficiendi.</q>
That is, <hi>By a rectitude of mind and life, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure true happineſs and the applauſe of your own heart, and let it be the labour of your every day, to come as near perfection as it is poſſible for human nature to get.</hi> This Moſaic piece of painting is indeed an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing. It has a fine effect in this grotto, and is a noble monument of the maſterly hand of Miſs <hi>Noel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was her fine genius leſs viſible in the ſtriking appearance of the extremely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſhells and valuable curioſities, all round the apartment. Her father ſpared no coſt to procure her the fineſt things of the ocean and rivers from all parts of the world, and pebbles, ſtones, and ores of the greateſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and worth. Theſe were all diſpoſed in ſuch a manner as not only ſhed a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious luſtre in the room, but ſhewed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this young lady in natural knowledge.</p>
               <p>In one part of the grot, were collected and arranged the ſtony coverings of all the ſhell-fiſh in the ſea, from the <hi>ſtriated patella</hi> and its ſeveral ſpecies, to the <hi>pholades</hi> in all their ſpecies: and of thoſe that live in the freſh ſtreams, from the <hi>ſuboval limpet</hi> or <hi>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonated patella</hi> and its ſpecies, to the <hi>trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0028500100:61"/>and deeply ſtriated cardia.</hi> Even all the land-ſhells were in this collection, from the <hi>pomatia</hi> to the <hi>round-mouthed turbo.</hi> The moſt beautiful genera of the ſea-ſhells, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with foſſil corals of all the kinds; with animal ſubſtances become foſſil; and with copper-ores; agates; pebbles, pieces of the fineſt marmora and alabaſtritae, and the moſt elegant and beautiful marcaſites, and chryſtals, and ſpars. Theſe filled the greateſt part of the walls, and in claſſes, here and there, were ſcattered, as foils to raiſe the luſtre of the others, the inferior ſhells.</p>
               <p>Among the ſimple ſea-ſhells, that is, thoſe of one ſhell, without a hinge, I ſaw ſeveral rare ones, that were neither in Mrs. <hi>O'Hara</hi>'s, nor in Mrs. <hi>Crafton</hi>'s grottos in <hi>Fingal,</hi> as I obſerved to thoſe ladies 

<note n="(5)" place="bottom">
                     <p>I had once a ſweet little country houſe in the neighbourhood of thoſe ladies, and uſed to be often at their gardens and grottos. Mrs. <hi>Crafton</hi> had the fineſt ſhells, but her grott was dull and regular, and had no appearance of nature in the formation. She was a pious, plain, refined lady, but had not a fancy equal to the operation required in a ſhell-houſe.</p>
                     <p>The excellent, the polite, the well-bred, the good and unfortunate Mrs. <hi>O'Hara</hi> had a glorious fancy. She was a genius, and had an imagination that formed a grotto wild and charming as <hi>Calypſo</hi>'s. Her fancy did likewiſe form the garden (in which the grotto ſtood, near the margin of a flood) into a paradiſe of delights.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0028500100:62"/>

Many a pleaſing, ſolitary hour, have I paſſed in this charming place; and all at laſt I ſaw in ruins; the garden in diſorder — and every fine ſhell torn from the grotto.</p>
                     <p>Such are the changes and chances of this firſt ſtate; changes wiſely deſigned by providence as warnings not to ſet up our reſt here: that we may turn our hearts from this world, and with all our might labour for that life which ſhall never periſh.</p>
                     <p>What ruined Mrs. <hi>O'Hara</hi>'s grotto deprived me of my little green and ſhady retreat. <hi>Charles O'Hara,</hi> this lady's huſband, a ſtrange man, from whom I rented my pretty farm, and to whom I had paid a fine to lower the rent, had mortgaged it, unknown to me, to the famous <hi>Damer,</hi> and that powerful man ſwallowed all. All I had there was ſeized for arrears of intereſt due of Mr. <hi>O'Hara,</hi> and as I was ever liable to diſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I took my leave of <hi>Fingall.</hi>

The ground is like the white of a fine pearl, and the body all over variegated with irregular marks of black, which have a near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Hebrew characters. This ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſhell is an Eaſt Indian.</item>

This very elegant ſhell, whoſe ground is a charming white, is found on the coaſt of Guinea, from five to ſix inches in length, and its diameter at the head often three inches. It tapers gradually, and at the extremity is a large obtuſe. Its variegations in its ſpots are very beautiful, and its ſpots are principally diſpoſed in many circles round the ſhell.</item>

Its length is five inches in its perfection, and two and a half broad at the head. The body is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe cone: the clavicle is pointed, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral volutions. The ground is the fineſt yellow, and beautifyed all over with ſmall brown ſpots, in regular and round ſeries. Theſe variegations are exceeding pretty, and as this rare Eaſt Indian ſhell has beſide theſe beauties three charming bands round the body, which are formed of large ſpots of a deep brown, a pale brown, and white, and reſemble the ſpots on the wings of butterflies, it is a beautiful ſpecies indeed. The animal that inhabits this ſhell is a <hi>limax.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0028500100:65"/>a half, at its grateſt increaſe. Its clavicle has many volutions, and terminates in an obtuſe point.

Its length, full grown, is five inches; the clavicle ſhort, but in volutions diſtinct; and its roſtrum from the mouth twice the length of the reſt of the ſhell. This ſnout and the body have four ſeries of ſpines, generally an inch and half long pointed at the ends, and ſomewhat crooked. The ſpines lie in regular, longitudinal ſeries. The mouth is almoſt round, but the opening is continued in the form of a ſlit up the roſtrum. The colour of this American, and extremely elegant ſhell, is a tawny yellow, with a fine mixture of a lively brown, and by bleaching on the coaſts, it gets many ſpots of white.</item>

It has an oblong clavicle in ſeveral volutions, pointed at the extremity, and the other extreme is a ſhort roſtrum. The whole ſurface is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with elevated ribs, that are about twice as thick as a ſtraw, and as diſtant from each other as the thickneſs of four ſtraws. The colour is a fine deep brown, variegated with white and a paler brown, in a manner ſurprizingly beautiful.</item>

Its length, in a ſtate of perfection, is four inches and a half; its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter three. It is oblong and gibbous, has a wide mouth, and lips ſo continued beyond the verge, as to form at each extremity a broad and ſhort beak. The colour is a fine pale yellow, and over the body are three brown faſciae: but the whole ſurface, and theſe faſciae, are ornamented with multitudes of the moſt beautiful round ſpots, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble eyes in the wings of the fineſt but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies.

One of them was three inches long, and two and a half in diameter. The valves were convex, and in longitudinal
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0028500100:67"/>direction deeply ſtriated. The hinge at the prominent end was large and beautifully wrought, and the opening of the ſhell was covered with the moſt elegant wrinkled lips, of the moſt beautiful red colour, finely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with white; theſe lips do not unite in the middle, but have ſlender and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſpines round about the truncated ends of the ſhell. This <hi>ſhell of Venus</hi> is an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, and valued by the collectors at a high rate.</item>

The Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Oyſter.</label> But of all the curious ſhells in this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful collection, the <hi>hammer oyſter</hi> was what I wondered at moſt; it is the moſt extraordinary ſhell in the world. It reſembles a pickax, with a very ſhort handle and a long head. The body of the ſhell is in the place of the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the inſtrument, and is four inches and a half long, and one inch and a half in diameter. What anſwered to the head of the pickax was ſeven inches long, and three quarters of an inch in diameter. This head terminates at each end in a narrow obtuſe point, is uneven at the edges, irregular in its make, and lies croſswiſe to the body: yet the valves ſhut in the cloſeſt and moſt elegant manner. The edges are deeply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and plated, and the lines run in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular directions. The colour without is a fine mixture of brown and purple; and within, a pearly white, with a tinge of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0028500100:68"/>purple. This rare ſhell is an Eaſt-Indian, and whenever it appears at an auction is rated very high. I have known ten guineas given for a perfect one.</item>

It was not only, that Miſs <hi>Noel</hi>'s happy fancy had blended all theſe things in the wildeſt and moſt beautiful diſpoſition over the walls of the rotunda; but her fine genius had produced a variety of grotts within her grotto, and falling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and points of view. In one place, was the famous <hi>Atalanta,</hi> and her delightful cave: and in another part, the Goddeſs and Ulyſſes's ſon appeared at the entrance of that grott, which under the appearance of a rural plainneſs had every thing could charm the eye: the roof was ornamented with ſhell-work; the tapeſtry was a tender

               <p>
                  <label>An image of Epictetus and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Legend.</label> But what above all the finely fancyed works in Miſs <hi>Noel</hi>'s grotto pleaſed me,  was, a figure of the Philoſopher <hi>Epictetus,</hi> in the centre of the grott. He ſat at the door of a cave, by the ſide of a falling water, and held a book of his philoſophy in his hand, that was written in the manner of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, that is, on parchment rolled up cloſe together. He appeared in deep meditation, and as part of the book had been unwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and gradually extended, from his knee on the ground, one could read very plain, in large Greek characters, about fifty lines. The Engliſh of the leſſon was this.</p>

Back then we returned to the parlour, and there found the old Gentleman. We ſat down immediately to two very good diſhes, and when that was over, Mr. <hi>Noel</hi> and I drank a bottle of old Alicant. Tho' this Gentleman was upwards of eighty, yet years had not deprived him of reaſon and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. He was lively and ſenſible, and ſtill a moſt agreeable companion. He talked of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as if he had lived there before the Aera of chriſtianity. The court of Auguſtus he was ſo far from being a ſtranger
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0028500100:72"/>to, that he deſcribed the principal perſons in it; their actions, their pleaſures, and their caprices, as if he had been their contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary. We talked of all theſe great characters. We went into the the gallery of <hi>Verres.</hi> We looked over the antient theatres. Several of the moſt beautiful paſſages in the Roman po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets this fine old man repeated, and made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant, but moral remarks upon them.</p>

Such a grace, without thinking of it, every one ſhould ſtrive to have, whatever they are doing. They ſhould make it habitual to them. <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſeems to have had theſe fine lines in view, in his deſcription of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour: Neque enim geſtum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni ad ſimilitudinem ſaltationis volo, ſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe aliquid, in hac exercitatione puerili, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de nos non id agentes, furtim decor ille diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centibus traditus ſubſequatur.

               <p>In this manner, did the old gentleman and I paſs the time, till the clock ſtruck five, when Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> came into the parlour again, and her father ſaid he muſt retire, to take

I am your ſervant, ſir; and he withdrew.

Charming an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, I ſaid, the beauties of your mind have inſpired me with a paſſion, that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe every time I behold the harmony of your face; and by the powers divine, I ſwear to love you, ſo long as Heaven ſhall permit me to breath the vital air. Bid me then either live or die, and while I do live, be aſſured, that my life will be devoted to you only.—But in vain was all this warmth. Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> ſat as unmoved as <hi>Erycina</hi> on a monument, and only anſwered, with a ſmile, Since your days, ſir, are in my diſpoſal, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you will change to ſome other ſubject, and ſome article that is rational and uſeful: otherwiſe, I muſt leave the room.</p>

If you pleaſe then, Madam,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0028500100:76"/>we will conſider the <hi>miracle</hi> at <hi>Babel,</hi> and enquire into the language of the world at that time.

For my part, I think with Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> that the divine interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition at <hi>Babel</hi> was for quite another end, to wit, to confound their <hi>confeſſion,</hi> and caſt out of their minds the name or object of it, that a man might not liſten to the <hi>lip</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of his neighbour. They were made to loſe their own <hi>lip,</hi> and to differ about the words of their atheiſtical confeſſion.</p>
               <p>As to a <hi>confuſion</hi> of <hi>confeſſions</hi> (Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> replyed), it appears to me to be a notion without any foundation to reſt on. The argument of <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> that the word <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hah,</hi> the name for a <hi>lip,</hi> when uſed for the <hi>voice</hi> or <hi>ſpeech,</hi> is never once in the Bible uſed in any other ſenſe than for <hi>confeſſion,</hi> is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0028500100:77"/>not good; becauſe tho' <hi>Shephah</hi> is often ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed for <hi>religious diſcourſe</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; yet the phraſes, <hi>other lips</hi> and <hi>other tongues,</hi> are alſo uſed for <hi>other langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, utterances, pronunciations, dialects.</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 14.21.22. applys <hi>Shephah</hi> to <hi>language</hi> or <hi>dialect</hi> in his quotation from the prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. 28. ver. 11.12.—He ſays, in the <hi>law</hi> it is written, <hi>With</hi>

                     <p>To this ſtammering or uncouth pronunciation of barbarous dialects the prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> refers, 36.3. <hi>Ye are made to come upon the lip of the tongues:</hi> that is, Ye are become a <hi>bye-word</hi> even in the <hi>heathen gabble,</hi> among the <hi>babling nations</hi> where ye are in <hi>captivity.</hi> —The author of <hi>Letter and Spirit</hi> ſays, the word <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> uſed in ſo many <hi>languages</hi> (with only their reſpective different determinations) for perſons of <hi>ſtrange</hi> or <hi>foreign tongues,</hi> is a monument of <hi>the great confuſion at Babel;</hi> this word being a <hi>corruption</hi> of the reduplicate <hi>Chaldee</hi> word <hi>Balbel,</hi> by changing the l in each place into r.—Some ſay, the word in the other languages, is derived from the <hi>Arabic Barbar,</hi> to <hi>murmur like ſome beaſt.—Scaliger</hi> defines it, Pronunciatio vitioſa &amp; inſuavis, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraſque male exprimens, blaeſorum balborumque more: which was hitting upon the truth as to part of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>confuſion.</hi> Indeed <hi>Bloeſus</hi> and <hi>Balbus,</hi> in Latin, are both derived, in like manner from <hi>Bal,</hi> and, <hi>Balbel.</hi>—The <hi>Welſh</hi> has preſerved a noble word for this <hi>barbariſm</hi> of <hi>confuſed language</hi> in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded term <hi>Baldwridd;</hi> which is a plain compound of the <hi>Hebrew Bal,</hi> and <hi>Dahar;</hi> without any other deflection from the original <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than that of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>b</hi> in the latter member of the word <hi>(Dabar)</hi> into the <hi>Welch w,</hi> a letter of the ſame organ.

Nor is this the only place
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0028500100:79"/>in <hi>ſcripture</hi> where <hi>Shephah, lip,</hi> ſignifies <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, pronunciations,</hi> and <hi>dialects;</hi> and where there is reference to the <hi>confuſion of tongues</hi> at <hi>Babel: Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the godly, ſays,—<hi>Thou ſhalt not ſee a fierce people, of a deeper ſpeech than thou canſt perceive, (of a deeper lip than thou canſt bear, Heb.) of a ſtammering or ridiculous tongue,</hi> that thou canſt not underſtand. This is enough in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and his fautors, in reſpect of what they ſay on the confuſion at <hi>Babel.</hi> This proves that the word <hi>Shephah, lip,</hi> ſignifies <hi>language, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, dialect,</hi> as well as <hi>confeſſion</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:</hi> and therefore, <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his account of the <hi>miracle</hi> at <hi>Babel,</hi> might have meant a <hi>confuſion of languages.</hi> That he did mean this, is plane not only from a <hi>tradition</hi> gone out into all the earth, which is a matter of greater regard than Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0028500100:80"/>but becauſe the <hi>ſacred oracles</hi> allude to this event. Beſide St. <hi>Paul</hi> aforementioned; the <hi>royal prophet</hi> in Pſalm 55. ver. 9. refers to the <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>tongues,</hi> and denounces a <hi>curſe</hi> in terms taken from that inflicted at <hi>Babel. Swallow up, O Lord, and divide their tongues.</hi> This ſeems to deſcribe the <hi>manner</hi> of that <hi>confuſion;</hi> — that the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>one language</hi> was ſunk or ſwallowed up in a vaſt chaos of univerſal <hi>babble:</hi> and that out of that jargon, it was again (by another act) <hi>divided</hi> or broken into many particular diſſonant <hi>dialects,</hi> or <hi>tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this (I ſaid) is very juſt, and gives me delight and ſatisfaction. I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, not only, that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was not the <hi>language</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or that <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſpeak the <hi>tongue</hi> the <hi>old world</hi> uſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the <hi>confuſion</hi> at <hi>Babel;</hi> but likewiſe, that the <hi>diviſion</hi> there was a <hi>diviſion</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> of the <hi>one language</hi> then ſpoken; and not a <hi>confuſion</hi> of <hi>confeſſions,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> affirms. Inform me however, if you pleaſe, what you mean by that <hi>tradition</hi> you mentioned, which declared the <hi>miracle</hi> of <hi>Babel</hi> was a confuſion of <hi>languages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> tradition (replied Miſs <hi>Noel</hi>) is preſerved in their <hi>Targum,</hi> and tells us, that the whole earth after the flood was of one <hi>ſpeech,</hi> or <hi>ſort of words,</hi> and when at their firſt remove from <hi>Ararat,</hi> they came to <hi>Shinar,</hi> they conſulted to build them a <hi>city,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0028500100:81"/>and a <hi>tower for an houſe of adoration,</hi> whoſe <hi>head might reach to,</hi> or <hi>be towards</hi> the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and to place an <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>hoſt of Heaven,</hi> for an object of <hi>worſhip,</hi> on the <hi>top</hi> of it; and to put a <hi>ſword</hi> in his hand, that he might make war for them againſt the <hi>divine armies,</hi> to <hi>prevent</hi> their <hi>diſperſion over the whole earth.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>reveled</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to execute vengeance upon them, and the Lord corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tongue, broke their ſpeech into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty languages, and ſcattered them over the face of the whole earth. No one knew what his fellow ſaid: and they ſlew one another, and ceaſed from building the city. Therefore he called the name of it <hi>Babel;</hi> becauſe there the Lord mingled together the tongues of all the inhabitants of the other. This you read in the <hi>Targum</hi> that was written before the days of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm: or, if not ſo early, yet it is a very antient book, and the <hi>doctor</hi> who compoſed it muſt certainly know the meaning of the word <hi>Shephah</hi> better than Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon.</hi> It appears upon the whole, that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this famous modern is without foundation.</p>
               <p>It is indeed (I anſwered): But then I am not able to conceive how <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſons converſed with ſo many nations —or how the <hi>Hebrew</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> writ in was preſerved. Illuminate me in theſe things,

               </p>
               <p>To talk of <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Elohim</hi> (reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſs <hi>Noel),</hi> and ſay all that ought to be ſaid, (to ſpeak to any purpoſe) of the <hi>three heads</hi> and <hi>four viſages,</hi> the <hi>bull,</hi> the <hi>man,</hi> the <hi>lyon,</hi> and the <hi>eagle,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>prophet,</hi> requires more knowledge in Hebrew learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than I pretend to be miſtreſs of, and muſt take up more time than there is now to ſpare. I may hereafter however, if you ſhould chance to come again to our houſe, let you know my fancys upon theſe grand ſubjects, and why I cannot accord with Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and my father, in their notion of the <hi>Cherubim</hi>'s ſignifying the unity of the eſſence, the diſtinction of the Perſons, and man's being taken into the eſſence by his perſonal union with the ſecond perſon, whoſe conſtant emblem was the lyon. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs appears to my plain underſtanding very miſerable <hi>ſtuff.</hi> I can ſee no text either in the Old Teſtament, or in the New, for a plurality of Beings, co-ordinate and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. The <hi>ſacred pages</hi> declare there is <hi>One original perfect mind. The Lord ſhall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0028500100:83"/>be King over all the earth. In that day there ſhall be</hi> ONE LORD, <hi>and his name</hi> ONE; ſays the prophet <hi>Zechariah,</hi> ſpeaking of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious revolution in the <hi>Gentile world,</hi> whence in proceſs of time, by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the worſhip of <hi>One true God</hi> ſhall prevail all over the earth, as univerſally as <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> had done before. — This I dare not obſerve to my father, as he is an admirer of Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and will not bear any contradiction: but my private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> on the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim</hi> and <hi>Elohim</hi> or <hi>Eloim,</hi> is a <hi>mad commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator,</hi> as I may ſhow you, if we ever happen to meet again.</p>
               <p>At preſent, all I can do more on the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſubject, is to obſerve that, in reſpect of the preſervation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, I imagine the <hi>one prevailing language</hi> before the <hi>miracle</hi> at <hi>Babel,</hi> (which one language was afterwards called <hi>Hebrew)</hi> tho' <hi>divided</hi> and <hi>ſwallowed</hi> as it were at the <hi>Tower,</hi> was kept without change in the line of <hi>Shem,</hi> and continued their tongue. This cannot be diſputed, I believe. I likewiſe imagine, it muſt be allowed, that this <hi>Hebrew</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the <hi>vernacular tongue</hi> of the old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites.</hi> It is otherwiſe unaccountable how the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was found to be the <hi>language</hi> of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> when the family of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> came among them again, after an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of more than 200 years. If they had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0028500100:84"/>had another tongue at the confuſion, was it poſſible for <hi>Abraham,</hi> during his temporary ſojournments among them, and in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his peregrination, to perſuade ſo many tribes to quit their <hi>dialect,</hi> and learn his language;— or, if his influence had been ſo amazing, can it be ſuppoſed, they would not return again to their old language, after he had left them, and his family was away from them more than 200 years? No, Sir. We cannot juſtly ſuppoſe ſuch a thing. The language of the old <hi>Canaanites</hi> could not be a different one from the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> If you will look into <hi>Bochart</hi> 

                  <note n="(7)" place="bottom">

, you will find this was his opinion. That great man ſays the <hi>Ante-Babel</hi> language eſcaped the confuſion two ways, viz. by the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> through God's providence preſerving it in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies for the future uſe of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who

               <p>This ſong delighted the old gentleman to a great degree. He told me, he was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0028500100:92"/>with it, not only for the fine muſick I made of it, but the morality of it, and liked me ſo much, that I was moſt heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to make his ſolitary retreat my home, as often and as long as I pleaſed. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did ſo, and continued to behave in ſuch a manner, that in two months time, I gained ſo intirely his affections, and ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the heart of his admirable daughter, that I might have her in wedlock when I pleaſed, after the expiration of that current year, which was the young lady's requeſt, and be ſecured of his eſtate at his death; beſide a large fortune to be immediately paid down; and this, tho' my father ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſettle any thing on me, or Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> my wife. This was generous and charming as my heart could deſire. I thought my ſelf the happieſt of men. Every week I went to Eden-Park, one time or other, to ſee my dear Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> and pay my reſpects to her worthy father. We were while I ſtayed a moſt happy family, and enjoyed ſuch ſatisfactions as few I believe have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in this tempeſtuous hemiſphere. Mr. <hi>Noel</hi> was paſſionately fond of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he could not regard me more if I had been his own ſon. I loved my <hi>Harriot</hi> with a fondneſs beyond deſcription, and that glorious girl had all the eſteem I could wiſh ſhe had for me. Our mutual felicity could
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0028500100:93"/>riſe no higher till we gave our hands, as we had already plighted our hearts.</p>
               <p>This world is a ſeries of viſionary ſcenes, and contains ſo little ſolid, laſting felicity, as I have found it, that I cannot call <hi>life</hi> more than a <hi>deception;</hi> and, as <hi>Swift</hi> ſays it, he is the happieſt man, who is beſt deceived. When I thought myſelf within a fortnight of being married to Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> and thereby made as compleatly happy in every reſpect as it was poſſible for a mortal man to be, the ſmall pox ſteps in, and in ſeven days time, reduced the fineſt human frame in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the moſt hideous and offenſive block. The moſt amiable of human creatures mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed all over, and became a ſpectacle the moſt hideous and unbearable.—This broke her father's heart in a month's time, and the paradice I had in view, ſunk into everlaſting night.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Miſs Noel's character.</label> My heart,  upon this ſad accident, bled and mourned to an extreme degree. All the tender paſſions were up in my ſoul, and with great difficulty could I keep my ruffled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in tolerable decorum. I loſt what I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued more than my life — more than repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed millions of worlds, if it had been poſſible to get them in exchange. This engaged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved partner, was an honour to her ſex, and an ornament to human kind. She was one of the wiſeſt and moſt agreeable of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0028500100:94"/>and her life quite glorious for piety to God, compaſſion to the neceſſitous and miſerable, benevolence and good will to all, with every other grace and virtue. Theſe ſhined with a bright luſtre in her whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, and rendered her beloved, and the delight of all that knew her. Senſe and genius were in her united, and by ſtudy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, and application, ſhe improved the talents, in the happieſt manner. She had acquired a ſuperiority in thinking, ſpeaking, writing, and acting, and in manners, her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, her language, her deſign, her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, was inexpreſſibly charming. Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> died in the 24th year of her age, the 29th of December, in the year 1724.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>A reflexion on the death of Miſs Noel.</label> This diſmal occurrence ſat powerfully on my ſpirits for ſome time,  and for near two months, I ſcarcely ſpoke a word to any one. I was ſilent, but not ſullen. As my tears and lamentations could not ſave her, ſo I knew they could not fetch her back again. Death and the grave have neither eyes nor ears. The thing to be done upon ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly an occaſion, is to adore the Lord of infinite wiſdom, as he has a right to ſtrike our comforts dead, and ſo improve the awful event, by labouring to render our whole temper and deportment chriſtian and divine, that we may able to live, while we do live, ſuperior to the ſtrokes of fortune, and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0028500100:95"/>calamities of human life; and when God bids us die, (in whatever manner, and at whatever time it may be) have nothing to do but to die, and ſo go enter into our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's joy. This is wiſdom. This good we may extract from ſuch doleful things. This was the effect my dear Miſs <hi>Noel</hi>'s death had on me, and when I ſaw myſelf deprived of ſo invaluable a thing in this world, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to double my diligence in ſo acting my part in it, that whenever I was to paſs through the laſt extremity of nature, I might be diſmiſſed with a bleſſing to another world, and by virtue of the ſublime excellencies of our holy religion, proceed to the abodes of immortality and immutable felicity.</p>
               <p>I wiſh I could perſuade you, reader, to reſolve in the ſame manner. If you are young, and have not yet experienced life, believe me, all is <hi>vanity,</hi> diſappointment, wearineſs, and diſſatisfaction, and in the midſt of troubles and uncertainties, we are haſtening on to an unknown world, from whence we ſhall never return again. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our diſſolution be near, we know not; but this is certain, that <hi>death,</hi> that univerſal conqueror, is making after us apace, to ſeize us as his captives; and therefore, <hi>tho' a man live many years, and rejoice in them all,</hi> (which is the caſe of very few), <hi>yet let him remember the days of darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0028500100:96"/>And when death does come, our lot may be the moſt racking pains and diſtempers, to faſten us down to our ſick-beds, till we reſign our ſpirits to ſome ſtrange region, our breath to the common air, and our bodies to the duſt from whence they were taken. Diſmal ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation! If in the days of our health, we did not make our happineſs and moral worth correſpond — did not labour, in the time of our ſtrength, to eſcape from <hi>wrong opinion</hi> and <hi>bad habit,</hi> and to render our minds <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and incorrupt;</hi> if we did not worſhip and love the <hi>ſupreme mind,</hi> and adore his <hi>divine adminiſtration,</hi> and all the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> If this was not our caſe, before corruption begins to lay hold of us, deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt we be, when torments come upon us, and we have only hopeleſs wiſhes that we had been wiſer, as we deſcend in ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to our <hi>ſolitary retreat;</hi> to proceed from thence to judgment. Language cannot paint the horrors of ſuch a condition. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of mind, and the torture of body, are a ſcene of miſery beyond deſcription.</p>
               <p>Or if without torment, we lie down in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſink into the land of forgetfulneſs, yet, ſince the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is to raiſe us from the regions of darkneſs, and bring us to the ſeſſions of righteouſneſs, where all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be ſtrictly tried and examined, and every one ſhall be judged according to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0028500100:97"/>the deeds done in the body, whether they have been good or evil; what can ſcreen us from the <hi>wrath</hi> of that <hi>mighty power,</hi> which is to break off the ſtrong fetters of death, and to throw open the iron gates of the grave, if injuſtice, cruelty, and oppreſſion, have been our practice in this world; or if, in the neglect of the diſtreſſed and hungry, we have given up ourſelves to chambering and wantonneſs, to gluttony and volutuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? It is <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>obedience, acts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy,</hi> that only can deliver us. If we worſhip in ſpirit and in truth the <hi>moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of immortal Beings,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent in wiſdom and action,</hi> and <hi>perform</hi> all the <hi>offices</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>friendſhip</hi> to every man, then our Lord will pronounce us the <hi>bleſſed of his Father.</hi> If we <hi>do evil,</hi> we ſhall <hi>come forth</hi> unto the <hi>reſurrection of damnation.</hi> — This merits your attention, reader, and I hope you will immediately begin to ponder, what it is to have a place aſſigned in incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable happineſs or miſery for ever.</p>

               <p> Having thus loſt Miſs <hi>Noel,</hi> and my good old friend, her worthy father, I left the univerſity, and went down to the country, after five years and three months abſence, to ſee how things were poſited at home, and pay my reſpects to my father; but I found them very little to my liking, and in a ſhort time, returned to Dublin again. He
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0028500100:98"/>had lately married in his old age a young wife, who was one of the moſt artful, falſe, and inſolent of women, and to gratify her to the utmoſt of his power, had not only brought her nephew into his houſe, but was ridiculouſly fond of him, and laviſhly gratifyed all his deſires. Whatever this little brute (the ſon of a drunken beggar, who had been a journey-man glover) was pleaſed, in wantonneſs, to call for, and that his years, then ſixteen, could require, my father's fortune in an inſtant produced; while ſcarcely one of my rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands could be anſwered. Money, cloaths, ſervants, horſes, dogs, and all things he could fanſy, were given him in abundance; and to pleaſe the baſeſt of women, and the moſt cruel ſtep-mother that ever the Devil inſpired to make the ſon of another woman miſerable, I was denied almoſt every thing. The fine allowance I had at the Univerſity was taken from me. Even a horſe to ride out to the neighbouring gentlemen, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed me, tho' my father had three ſtables of extraordinary cattle; and till I purchaſed one, was forced to walk it, where-ever I had a mind to viſit. What is ſtill more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (if any thing of ſeverity can be ſo, when a mother-in-law is ſovereign) I was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to keep my horſe even at graſs on the land, tho' five hundred acres of freehold
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0028500100:99"/>eſtate ſurrounded the manſion, but obliged to graze it at a neighbouring farmer's. Nor was this all the hard meaſure I received. I was ordered by my father to become the young man's preceptor; to ſpend my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time in teaching this youngſter, and in labouring to make the little deſpicable dunce a ſcholar. All this was more than I could bear. My life became inſupportable, and I reſolved to range even the wilds of <hi>Africa,</hi> if nothing better offered, rather than live a miſerable ſlave under the cruel tyranny of thoſe unrelenting oppreſſors.</p>
               <p>My father however, by the way, was as fine a gentleman as ever lived, a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary underſtanding, and a ſcholar; likewiſe remarkably juſt and good to all the world, except my ſelf, after I left the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: and to do him all the juſtice in my power, and vindicate him ſo far as I am able, I muſt not conceal, that great as the aſcendant was, which my mother-in-law had over him, and as much as he was hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecked by that low woman, who had been his ſervant maid, yet it was not to her only that my ſufferings were owing. Religion had a hand in my miſery. Falſe religion was the ſpring of that paternal reſentment I ſuffered under.</p>

               <p> It was my father's wont to have prayers read every night and morning in his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0028500100:100"/>family,  and the office was the litany of the common-prayer book. This work, on my coming home, was transferred from my ſiſter to me, and for about one week I perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the old gentleman's ſatisfaction, as my voice was good, and my reading diſtinct and clear: but this office was far from being grateful to me, as I was become a ſtrict <hi>Unitarian,</hi> by the leſſons I had received from my private tutor in college, and my own examinations of the vulgar faith. It went againſt my conſcience to uſe the tritheiſtic form of prayer, and became at laſt ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy to me, that I altered the prayers the firſt Sunday morning, and made them more agreeable to <hi>ſcripture</hi> as I conceived. My father at this was very highly enraged, and his paſſion aroſe to ſo great a height, upon my defending my confeſſion, and refuſing to read the eſtabliſhed form, that he called me the moſt impious and execrable of wretches, and with violence drove me from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Soon after however he ſent me <hi>Lord Nottingham's Letter to Mr. Whiſton,</hi> and deſired I would come to him when I had carefully read it over. I did ſo, and he aſked me what I thought of the book. I anſwered, that I thought it a weak piece, and if he would hear me with patience, in relation to that in particular, and to the caſe in general, perhaps he might think my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0028500100:101"/>a little better than at preſent he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be. I will hear you, he ſaid: proceed. — Then I immediately began, and for a full hour repeated an apology I had prepared 

<note n="(9)" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Reader will find this apology in the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to this life.

               <p> On the firſt day of May then, early in the morning, as the clock ſtruck one, I mounted my excellent mare, and with my boy, O'Fin, began to journey as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0028500100:102"/>I had projected, on ſeeing how things went. I did not communicate my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to a ſoul, nor take my leave of any one, but in the true ſpirit of adventure, abandoned my father's dwelling, and ſet out to try what fortune would produce in my favor. I had the world before me, and Providence my guide. As to my ſubſtance, it conſiſted of a purſe of gold, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fifty Spaniſh piſtoles, and half a ſcore moidores; and I had one bank note for five hundred pounds, which my dear Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> left me by her will, the morning ſhe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; and it was all ſhe had of her own to leave to any one. With this I ſet forward, and in five days time arrived from the Weſtern extremity of Ireland at a village called Rings-end, that lies on the Bay of Dublin. Three days I reſted there, and at the <hi>Conniving-Houſe</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Conniving-Houſe,</hi> (as the gentlemen of Trinity called it in my time, and long after) was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle public houſe, kept by <hi>Jack Macklean,</hi> about a quarter of a mile beyond Rings-end, on the top of the beach, within a few yards of the ſea. Here we uſed to have the fineſt fiſh at all times; and in the ſeaſon, green peas, and all the moſt excellent vegetables. The ale here was always extraordinary, and every thing the beſt; which, with its delightful ſituation, rendered it a delightful place of a ſummer's evening.

               <p> The wind, in the afternoon, ſeemed good and fair, and we were in hopes of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Cheſter</hi> the next day: but at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, a tempeſt aroſe, which held in all the horrors of hurricane, thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for two nights and a day, and left us no hope of eſcape. It was a dreadful ſcene indeed, and looked as if the laſt fatal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault was making on the globe. As we had many paſſengers, their cries were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and affected me more than the flaſhing fires and the winds. For my part, I was well reconciled to the great change, but I confeſs that nature ſhrunk at the frightful manner of my going off, which I expected every moment the ſecond night.

               </p>
               <p>Four remarkable things I noticed while the tempeſt laſted.
<list>
                     <label>The caſe of Dean Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</label>
                     <item>One was, that the <hi>Dean</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0028500100:104"/>of <hi>Derry,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whaley,</hi> whom we had on board, (who had nineteen hundred a year from the church, for teaching the people to be Chriſtians) was vaſtly more afraid than one young lady of the company, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared quite ſerene. The Dean, tho' a fine Orator at land, was ridiculous in his fears at ſea. He ſcreamed as loud as any of the people: But this young lady behaved, like an angel in a ſtorm. She was calm and reſigned, and ſat with the mate and me, the ſecond night, diſcourſing of the divine power, and the laws of nature, in ſuch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars. By the way, neither mate, nor maſter, nor hand, could keep the deck. The ſhip was left to the mercy of the winds and waves.</item>
                     <label>The Caſe of Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth.</label>
                     <item>The ſecond remarkable thing is,  that as this young lady went into naked bed in her cabbin, the firſt night, before the tempeſt began to ſtir, it was not many hours till a ſea ſtruck us upon the quarter, and drove in one of our quarter, and one of our ſtern dead lights, where we ſhipped great quantities of water, that put us under great apprehenſions of foundering, and filled ſo ſuddenly the cloſe wooden bed in which Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> lay, that had not I chanced to be then leaning againſt the partition, and ſnatched her out, the moment I found my ſelf all over wet, and half covered with the breaking ſea, ſhe muſt inevitably have periſhed. I ran up on deck
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0028500100:105"/>with her in my arms, and laid her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſenſeleſs and naked there: and as there was no ſtaying many minutes in that place, I threw my great coat over her, and then brought her down to my own birth, which I gave her, and got her dry cloaths from her trunk, and made her drink a large glaſs of brandy, which ſaved her life. She got no cold, which I thought very ſtrange, but was hurt a little in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. When all was over, ſhe proteſted ſhe would never go into naked bed, on board ſhip, again.</item>
                     <label>The caſe of ſome offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the ſtorm.</label>
                     <item>The third particular is,  that there were ſome officers on board, moſt monſtrouſly wicked men, and when we were given over by the captain, and no hope he thought of being ſaved, theſe warriors lamented like young children, and were the moſt diſmal, diſturbing howlers on board: yet, when we got on land, they had done with <hi>O Lord, O Lord,</hi> and began again their obſcene talk, and to damn themſelves at every word to the center of hell.</item>
                     <label>The caſes of Gavan and Henley.</label>
                     <item>The fourth thing was this.  There was on board with us a young gentleman of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, one <hi>Pierce Gavan,</hi> who had been a fellow-commoner in my time of Trinity, Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. The firſt day of the ſtorm, he was carried over-board by a rolling ſea, and fairly lodged in the ocean, at above twenty yards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the ſhip; but the next tumbling
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0028500100:106"/>billow brought him back again. He was laid on the deck without any hurt. On the contrary, one <hi>Charles Henley,</hi> a young mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, was beat over, and we never ſaw him more.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Henley's character.</label> 
                  <hi>Henley</hi> was not only a man of ſenſe and prudence,  who had an honeſt mind, and a cultivated underſtanding, but by ſearch and enquiries into the doctrines, inſtitutions and motives of reveled religion, had the higheſt regard for the truths of genuine Chriſtianity, and choſe the beſt means in his power to make himſelf acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Gavan's character.</label> 
                  <hi>Gavan,</hi>  on the contrary, had no ſenſe of religion, nor did he ever think of the power and goodneſs of God. He was a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſwearer, drank exceſſively, and had the heart to debauch every pretty woman he ſaw, if it had been poſſible for him to do ſo much miſchief. — Yet this man, who never reformed that I heard, and whoſe impieties have ſhocked even young fellows who were no ſaints, was aſtoniſhingly preſerved; and <hi>Henley,</hi> who had the juſteſt natural notions, and liſtened to Revelation, periſhed miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? How ſhall we account for ſuch things? By ſaying, that the world that now is, and the world that is to come, are in the hands of God, and every tranſaction in them is quite right, tho' the reaſon of the procedure may be beyond our view. We cannot judge certainly of the ends and purpoſes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0028500100:107"/>and therefore to paſs judgment on the ways of God, is not only impious, but ridiculous to the laſt degree. This we know for certain, that whenever, or however, a good man falls, he falls into the hand of God, and ſince we muſt all die, the difference as to time and manner, ſignifies very little, when there is an infinite wiſdom to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh every caſe, and an infinite goodneſs to compenſate all our miſeries. This is enough for a Chriſtian. Happy is the man, and for ever ſafe, let what will happen, who acts a rational part, and has the fear and love of God in his thoughts. With pleaſure he looks into all the ſcenes of futurity. When ſtorms and earthquakes threaten calamity, diſtreſs, and death, he maintains an inward peace.</p>

                  <hi>Whitwell</hi> the mate, about thirty-ſix years of age at this time, told me,  he was the ſon of a man who once had a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and gave him a univerſity education, but left an eſtate ſo encumbered with debts, and ruined with mortgages, that its income was almoſt nothing, and therefore the ſon ſold the remains of it, and went to ſea with an Eaſt-India captain, in the 22d year of his age, and was ſo fortunate abroad, that he not only acquired riches, in four years time that he trafficked about, between Batavia and the Gulph of Perſia, but married a young Indian Lady, (the daughter of a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, or petty Prince in the Mogul Empire) who was rich, wiſe, and beautiful, and made his life ſo very happy, for three years that ſhe lived, that his ſtate was a mere Paradiſe, and he ſeemed a little ſovereign.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0028500100:109"/>the mountains, the other ſide of this African iſland, and uſed him with great humanity; their chief being very fond of him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining him in his mud-wall palace: he married there a pretty little yellow creature, niece to the poor ruler, and for twelve months was very far from being miſerable with this partner, as they had a handſome cottage and ſome cattle, and this wife was good-humour itſelf, very ſenſible, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious woman; her religion being half Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm and half Judaiſm. But ſhe died at the years end, and her uncle, the Chief, not living a month after her, <hi>Whitwell</hi> came down from the mountains to the next ſea coaſt under the conduct of one of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, his friend, and meeting with a Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ſhip there, got at laſt to London. A little money he had left behind him in England, by way of reſerve, in caſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, if he ever ſhould return to his own country, and with this he dreſt himſelf, got into buſineſs, and came at laſt to be mate of the Skinner and Jenkins. His deſtiny, he added, was untoward, but as he had thought, and read, and ſeen enough in his wide travels, to be convinced, the world, and every being, and every atom of it, were directed and governed by unerring wiſdom, he derived hopes and comforts from a due acknowledgment of God. There are more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0028500100:110"/>born to miſery than to happineſs, in this life: but all may die to be for ever glorious and bleſſed, if they pleaſe. — This concluſion was juſt and beautiful, and a life and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo uncommon I thought deſerved a memorial.</p>

               <p> Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> and I continued at the Talbot for three weeks, and during that time, breakfaſted, dined, and ſupped together. Except the hours of ſleep, we were rarely from each other. We walked out together every day, for hours converſed, ſometimes went to cards, and often ſhe ſung, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſung, while on my flute I played. With the greateſt civility, and the moſt exact good manners, we were as intimate as if we had been acquainted for ages, and we found a ſatisfaction in each others company, as great as lovers generally experience: yet ſo much as one ſyllable of the paſſion was no mentioned: not the leaſt hint of love on either ſide was given, while we ſtayed at Whitehaven; and I believe, neither of us had a thought of it. It was a friendſhip the moſt pure and exalted, that commenced at my ſaving her life, in the manner I have related, and by ſome ſtrange kind of magic, our notions and inclinations, tempers and ſentiments, had acquired ſuch a ſameneſs in a few days, that we ſeemed as two ſpiritual Socias, or duplicates of each others mind.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0028500100:111"/>
                  <hi>Body</hi> was quite out of the caſe, tho' this lady had an extravagance of beauty. My ſole delight was that fine percepient, which ſhed a luſtre on her outward charms. How long this ſtate would have laſted, had we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued more time together, and had the image of the late Miſs <hi>Noel</hi> been more effaced, or worn out of the ſenſory of my head, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay; but while it did laſt, there could be nothing more ſtrange. To ſee two young people of different ſexes, in the higheſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and moſt confirmed health, live together for twenty-one days, perfectly pleaſed with each other, intirely at their own diſpoſal, and as to fortune, having abundantly enough between them both for a comfortable life; and yet, never utter one word, nor give a look, that could be conſtrued a declaration of the paſſion, or a tendency towards a more intimate union; — to compleat that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which nature and providence requires of beings circumſtanced as we were; — this was very odd. Till the clock ſtruck twelve every night we ſat up, and talked of a vaſt variety of things, from the Bible down to the clouds of Ariſtophanes, and from the comedies and tragedies of Greece and Rome to the Minerva of Sanctius, and Hickes's northern Theſaurus. Inſtead of Venus or any of her court, our converſation would often be on the morals of Cicero, his aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0028500100:112"/>and de finibus; on the Engliſh or the Roman hiſtory; Shakeſpear's ſcenes of nature, or maps of life; whether the OEdipus or the Electra of Sophocles was the beſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy; and the ſcenes in which Plautus and Terence moſt excelled. Like two criticks, or two grammarians, antiquarians, hiſtorians, or philoſophers, would we paſs the evening with the greateſt chearfulneſs and delight.</p>

She remembred all ſhe had read. Her judgment was ſtrong, and her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections ever good. She told me her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was another Mrs. <hi>Dacier,</hi> and as her father was killed in a duel, when ſhe was very young, the widow <hi>Melmoth,</hi> inſtead of going into the world, continued to live at her country ſeat, and diverted herſelf with teaching her daughter the languages of Greece and Rome, and in educating her heart and mind. This made this young lady a maſter of the Latin tongue and Greek, and enable her to acquire a knowledge ſo various and fine, that it was ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear her expatiate and explain. She talked with ſo much eaſe and good humour, and had a manner ſo chearful and polite, that her diſcourſe was always entertaining, even tho' the ſubject happened to be, as it was one evening, the paulo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0028500100:113"/>paulo poſt futurum of a Greek verb. Theſe things however were not the only admirable ones in this character. So happily had her good mother formed and inſtructed her mind, that it appeared full of all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of rational honour, and devoted to that truly God-like religion, which exalts the ſoul to an affection rather than dread of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord of all things, and to a conviction that his laws lead us both to happineſs here and hereafter. She thorowly underſtood the uſe and excellence of Revelation, and had extracted from the inſpired volumes ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting comfort and ſecurity under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the divine Power and Majeſty: but ſhe told me, ſhe could not think rites and outward performances were eſſential to real religion. She conſidered what was juſt and beautiful in theſe things as uſeful and aſſiſting only to the devout mind.—In a word, this young lady was wiſe and good, humble and charitable. I have ſeen but one of her ſex ſuperior to her, in the powers of mind, and the beauties of body: that was Miſs <hi>Noel.</hi> Very few have I know that were equal.</p>

               <p> Having thus loſt my charming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, I travelled into a vaſt valley, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by mountains whoſe tops were above the clouds, and ſoon came into a country that is wilder than the Campagna of Rome, or the uncultivated vales of the Alps and Apennines. Warm with a claſſical enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, I journeyed on, and with fancy's eye beheld the <hi>rural divinities,</hi> in thoſe ſacred woods and groves, which ſhade the ſides of many of the vaſt ſurrounding fells, and the ſhores and promontories of many lovely lakes and bright running ſtreams. For ſeveral hours I travelled over mountains tremendous to behold, and through vales the fineſt in the world. Not a man or houſe could I ſee in eight hours time, but towards five in the afternoon, there appeared at the foot of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0028500100:116"/>a hill a ſweetly ſituated cottage, that was half covered with trees, and ſtood by the ſide of a large falling ſtream: a vale extended to the ſouth from the door, that was termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with rocks, and precipices on preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, in an amazing point of view, and through the flowery ground, the water was beautifully ſeen, as it winded to a deeper flood at the bottom of the vale. Half a dozen cows were grazing in view: and a few flocks of feeding ſheep added to the beauties of the ſcene.</p>
               <p>To this houſe I ſent my boy, to enquire who lived there, and to know, if for the night I could be entertained, as I knew not where elſe to go. <hi>O' Fin</hi> very quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and informed me, that one farmer <hi>Price</hi> was the owner of the place, but had gone in the morning to the next town, and that his wife ſaid, I was welcome to what her houſe afforded. In then I went, and was moſt civilly received by an exceeding pretty woman, who told me her huſband would ſoon be at home, and be glad ſhe was ſure to ſee me at their lone place; for he was no ſtranger to gentlemen and the world, tho' at preſent he rarely converſed with any one. She told me, their own ſupper would be ready an hour hence, and in mean time would have me take a can of fine ale and a bit of bread. She brought me a cup
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0028500100:117"/>of extraordinary mault-drink and a cruſt, and while I was eating my bread, in came Mr. <hi>Price.</hi>

               <p> The man ſeemed very greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at entering the room, and after he had looked with great earneſtneſs at me for a little while, he cryed out, Good Heaven! What do I ſee! <hi>Falſtaff,</hi> my claſs-fellow, and my ſecond ſelf. My dear friend you are welcome, thrice welcome to this part of the world. All this ſurprized me not a little, for I could not recollect at once a face that had been greatly altered by the ſmall-pox: And it was not till I reflected on the name <hi>Price</hi> that I knew I was then in the houſe of one of my ſchool-fellows, with whom I had been moſt intimate, and had played the part of <hi>Plump Jack</hi> in <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> when he did <hi>Prince Henry.</hi> This was an unexpected meeting indeed: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the place, and all the circumſtances belonging to the ſcene, a thing more ſtrange and affecting never came in my way. Our pleaſure at this meeting was very great, and when the moſt affectionate ſalutations were over, my friend <hi>Price</hi> proceeded in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
               <p>Often have I remembered you ſince we parted, and excluſive of the Greek and Engliſh plays we have acted together at <hi>Sheridan</hi>'s ſchool, in which you acquired no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0028500100:118"/>ſmall applauſe, I have frequently thought of our frolickſome rambles in vacation time, and the merry dancings we had at Mother Red-Cap's in Back-Lane; the hurling matches we have played at Dolphin's-Barn, and the cakes and ale we uſed to have at the Organ-houſe on Arbor-Hill. Theſe things have often occurred to my mind: but little did I think we ſhould ever meet again on <hi>Stainmore-hills.</hi> What ſtrange things does time produce! It has taken me from a town life to live on the moſt ſolitary part of the globe:— And it has brought you to journey where never man I believe ever thought of travelling before. So it is, (I replyed), and ſtranger things, dear <hi>Jack,</hi> may happen yet before our eyes are cloſed: why I journey this untravelled way, I will inform you by and by; when you have told me by what ſtrange means you came to dwell in this remote and ſilent vale. That you ſhall know, (Mr. <hi>Price</hi> ſaid) very ſoon, as ſoon as we have eaten a morſel of ſomething or other which my dear <hi>Martha</hi> has prepared againſt my return. Here it comes, a fowl, bacon and greens, and as fine I will anſwer as London market could yield. Let us ſit down, my friend, and God bleſs us and our meat.</p>
               <p>Down then we ſat immediatly to our diſh, and moſt excellent every thing was.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0028500100:119"/>The ſocial goodneſs of this fond couple ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded greatly to the pleaſure of the meal, and with mirth and friendſhip we eat up our capon, our bacon, and our greens.

               <p> When I left you at <hi>Sheridan</hi>'s ſchool, my remove was from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> to become a rich uncle's heir, and I got by my Indian airing a hundred thouſand pounds. There I left the bones of my mother's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after I had lived two years in that burning place, and from thence proceeded to <hi>London,</hi> to ſpend what an honeſt, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man had long toiled to ſave. But I had not been above three months in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of England, when it came into my head to paſs ſome time in France, and with a girl I kept made haſt to the French me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis. There I lived at a grand rate, and took from the French Opera-houſe another where. The <hi>Gaul</hi> and the <hi>Briton</hi> were both extreme fine girls, and agreed ſo well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I kept them both in one houſe. I thought my ſelf ſuperlatively happy in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a brace of females, and ſpared no coſt in procuring them all the finery and pleaſures that <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London</hi> could yield. I had a furniſhed houſe in both theſe cities,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0028500100:120"/>and with an expenſive equipage went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards. In four years time I ſpent a great deal of money, and as I had loſt large ſums at play, and theſe two whores agreed in the end to rob me, and retire with the money, where I ſhould never diſcover them, I found my ſelf in very mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling circumſtances, and had not ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds left in the fourth year from my uncle's death. How to diſpoſe of this and my ſelf was now the queſtion. What ſhall I do, (was my deliberation) to ſecure bread and quiet? Many a thoughtful hour this gave me, and at length I determined to purchaſe a little annuity. But before this could be effected, I went down to <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> on an information I had received, that my two ladies were at <hi>Appleby</hi> with other names, and on my money appeared as women of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But this journey was to no purpoſe, and I was preparing to return to London, when my wife you ſaw at the head of the table a while ago, came by chance in my way, and pleaſed me ſo well with her good underſtanding, face and perſon, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to marry her, if ſhe would have me, and give her the management of my five hundred pounds on a farm, as ſhe was a farmer's daughter, and could manage one to good advantage. Her father was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0028500100:121"/>lately dead, and this little mountain farm ſhe continued to occupy: therefore nothing could be more to my purpoſe, if I could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on her to make me her huſband, and with ſome difficulty ſhe did, to my unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able felicity. She had no money worth mentioning: but her houſe was pretty and comfortable, and her land had grain and cattle; and as I threw into her lap my five hundred pounds, a little before we were married, to be by her diſpoſed of and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, according to her pleaſure, ſhe ſoon made ſome good improvements and additions, and by her fine underſtanding, ſweet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and every Chriſtian virtue, continues to render my life ſo compleatly happy; ſo joyous and delightful; that I would not change my partner and condition, for one of the firſt quality and greateſt fortune. In her I have every thing I could wiſh for in a wife and a woman, and ſhe makes it the ſole ſtudy and pleaſure of her life to crown my every day with the higheſt ſatisfactions and comforts. Two years have I lived with her on theſe wild mountains, and in that time I have not had one dull or painful minute, but in thinking that I may loſe her, and be the wretched ſurvivor. That thought does ſometimes wound me. — In ſum, my friend, we are the happieſt of wedded mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and on this ſmall, remote farm, live
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0028500100:122"/>in a ſtate of bliſs to be envyed. This proves that happineſs does not flow from riches on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but that, where pure and perfect love, ſtrict virtue, and unceaſing induſtry, are united in the conjugal ſtate, they can make the Stainmore mountains a Paradice to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, in <hi>peace and little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is not only happineſs in this world that I have acquired by this admirable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but life eternal. You remember, my friend, what a wild and wicked one I was when a ſchool-boy, and as <hi>Barbadoes</hi> of all parts of the globe is no place to improve a man's morals in, I returned from thence to <hi>Europe</hi> as debauched a ſcelerate as ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Heaven by blaſphemy and illegal gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. Even my loſſes and approaching poverty were not capable of making any great change in me. When I was courting my wife, ſhe ſoon diſcerned my impiety, and perceived that I had very little notion of hell and heaven, death and judgment. This ſhe made a principal objection againſt being concerned with me, and told me, ſhe could not venture into a married connexion with a man, who had no regard to the divine laws, and therefore, if ſhe could not make me a Chriſtian, in the true ſenſe of the word, ſhe would never be Mrs. <hi>Price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0028500100:123"/>This from a plain, country girl, ſurprized me not a little, and my aſtoniſhment aroſe very high, when I heard her talk of religion, and the great end of both, a bleſſed life after this. She ſoon convinced me, that religion was the only means by which we can arrive at true happineſs, by which we can attain to the laſt perfection and dignity of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the authority and word of God is the ſureſt foundation of religion. The ſubſtance of what ſhe ſaid is as follows. I ſhall never forget the leſſon.</p>
               <p>The plain <hi>declarations</hi> of our <hi>Maſter</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> reſtore the dictates of <hi>uncorrupted reaſon</hi> to their force and authority, and give us juſt notions of God and of our ſelves. They inſtruct us in the nature of the Deity, diſcover to us his unity, holineſs, and purity, and afford certain means of obtaining eternal life. Revelation commands us to worſhip <hi>One Supreme God,</hi> the <hi>Supreme Father</hi> of all things; and to do his will, by imitating his perfections, and practiſing every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by that <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which he ſent the Meſſiah to revive and enforce: that by repentance, and righteouſneſs, and acts of devotion, we may obtain the Divine favor, and ſhare in the glories of futurity: for, the <hi>Supreme Director,</hi> whoſe <hi>goodneſs</hi> gives counſel to his <hi>power,</hi> commanded us into exiſtence to conduct us to everlaſting happineſs, and therefore, teaches us by his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0028500100:124"/>Son to pray, to praiſe, and to repent, that we may be entitled to a nobler inheritance than this world knows, and obtain life and immortality, and all the joys and bleſſings of the heavenly Canaan. This was the <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> deſign of our <hi>Creator.</hi> That <hi>ſuperior Agent,</hi> who acts not by arbitrary will, but by the maxims of unclouded reaſon, when he made us, and ſtationed us in this part of his creation, had no glory of his own in view, but what was perfectly conſiſtent with a juſt regard to the felicity of his rational ſubjects.</p>
               <p>It was this made the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhew <hi>Felix</hi> the unalterable obligations to <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>equity;</hi> to <hi>temperance,</hi> or, a command over the appetites; and then, by diſplaying the great and awful judgment to come, urge him to the practice of theſe, and all the other branches of morality; that by uſing the means preſcribed by God, and acting up to the conditions of ſalvation, he might eſcape that dreadful puniſhment, which, in the reaſon and nature of things, is connected with vice, and which the good government of the rational world requires ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the wicked; and might, on the contrary, by that mercy offered to the world thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſecure thoſe <hi>immenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> which are promiſed to <hi>innocence</hi> and the <hi>teſtimony of an upright heart.</hi> This <hi>faith
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0028500100:125"/>in Chriſt St. Paul</hi> placed before the <hi>Roman</hi> governor in the beſt light. He deſcribed the complexion and genius of the <hi>Chriſtian faith.</hi> He repreſented it as reveling the <hi>wrath</hi> of God againſt all <hi>immorality;</hi> and as joining with reaſon and uncorrupted nature, enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the practice of every moral and ſocial duty.</p>
               <p>What effect this diſcourſe had on <hi>Felix</hi> (<hi>Martha</hi> continued) in producing <hi>faith,</hi> that is, <hi>morality</hi> in an <hi>intelligent agent,</hi> we are told by the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> He <hi>trembled:</hi> but ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and the world had taken ſuch a hold of him, that he diſmiſſed the ſubject, and turned from a preſent uneaſineſs to profit and the enjoyment of ſin. He had done with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſacrificed the hopes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the world and its delights.</p>
               <p>But this (concluded <hi>Martha</hi>) will not I hope be your caſe. As a <hi>judgment to come</hi> is an awful ſubject, you will ponder in time, and look into your own mind. As a man, a reaſonable and ſocial creature, deſigned for <hi>duty</hi> to a God above you, and to a world of <hi>fellow-creatures</hi> around you, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the rules of virtue and morality, and be no longer numbered with thoſe miſerable mortals, who are doomed to condemnation upon their diſobedience. Thoſe rules lie open in a perfect goſpel, and the wicked can have nothing to plead for their behaviour.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0028500100:126"/>They want no light to direct them. They want no aſſiſtance to ſupport them in doing their duty. They have a <hi>Goſpel</hi> to bring them to <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> if they will but take notice of it; and if they will not walk in the light of God's law, this <hi>Goſpel</hi> muſt be their <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Say then, Sir, (<hi>Martha</hi> proceeded) can you be prevailed on to think of religion in its native purity and ſimplicity, and by the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo act with regard to virtue and piety, that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come not only in the power, but in the wiſdom and the juſtice of God, to judge the world, you may be ſecured from that miſery and diſtreſs, which is prepared for iniquity; and enjoy that eternal life, which is to be the portion of the righteous?</p>
               <p>In this extraordinary manner did Martha Harrington diſcourſe me, and the effect of it was (Jack Price continued), that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a thorow reform from that hour. My rational life from that happy day commenced, and I entred ſeriouſly into my own breaſt, to think in earneſt of that <hi>ſolemn judgment</hi> to come. What <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid was ſo clear and ſtrong, that I had not a thought of reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but truth at once intirely ſubdued my heart, and I flew to the Son of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt his interceſſion with the Father of the Univerſe for the pardon of all my crimes.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0028500100:127"/>The dignity and end of my being has ſince been the ſubject of my meditations, and I live convinced, that every thing is contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible that is inconſiſtent with duty and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. This renders even my pleaſures more agreeable. This gives eternal peace to my mind.</p>

               <p> Here <hi>Price</hi> ended his remarkable ſtory, and according to our agreement, I began to relate what happened to me from the time we parted at ſchool, and concluded with informing him, that I was going in ſearch of <hi>Charles Turner,</hi> my near friend, when fortune brought me to his houſe: that this gentleman lived ſomewhere towards the confines of Cumberland and the North-riding of Yorkſhire, but where the ſpot was I could not tell, nor did I know well how to go on, as the country before me ſeemed unpaſſable, on account of its mountains, precipices, and floods: I muſt try however what can be done; not only in regard to this gentleman; but, becauſe I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think it may be very much to my advantage, as he is very rich, and the moſt generous of men. If he is to be found, I know I ſhall be welcome to ſhare in his happineſs as long as I pleaſe, nor will it be any weight to him. <hi>Price</hi> to this replyed, that I was moſt heartily welcome to him as long as I pleaſed to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0028500100:128"/>ſtay, and that tho' he was far from being a rich man, yet he had every day enough for himſelf and one more; and his <hi>Martha</hi> he was ſure would be as well pleaſed with my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as if I had been his own brother, ſince ſhe knew I was his eſteemed friend. —In reſpect of the way, he ſaid, he would enable me to find Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> if he could, but the country was difficult to travel, and he doubted very much if one could go to the extremity of <hi>Cumberland</hi> or <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> over the hills; but we would try how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and if it was poſſible, find out Mr. <hi>Turner</hi>'s houſe. Yet ſolely with him I muſt not ſtay, if he could be ſeen. I muſt live between both, till I got ſome Northern girl, and had a wife and habitation of my own; and there is (continued <hi>Price</hi>) not many miles from me, a ſweet pretty laſs, the daughter of a gentleman-farmer, who is a very good man, and would, I believe, upon my recommendation, give you his girl, and a ſum of money, to ſit down on thoſe hills.—This is vaſtly kind, <hi>Jack,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, ſaid, and what I ſhall gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſo long as I live. I may ride ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mile I am ſure, and be an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer many a long day, before I meet with ſuch offers again. Your ſweetly ſituated houſe and good things, with a fine nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern girl and money down, are benefits
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0028500100:129"/>not to be met with every day.—But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the object I muſt purſue, is my uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity friend, <hi>Charles Turner,</hi> and if you pleaſe to do me the great favor of guiding me ſo far as you can over this wild, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited land, after I have ſtayed with you, for the firſt time, two or three days, and promiſe to abide many more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it be in my power, we will ſet out in queſt of what I want. As you will, my friend <hi>Price</hi> replyed: and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, let us be gay. Here comes my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with a little bowl of punch, and as ſhe ſings extremely well, and you have not forgot I fanſy our old ſong, we will have it over our nectar. You ſhall repreſent <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Momus,</hi> and I will be <hi>Chronos</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and my wife <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Let us take a glaſs firſt — the <hi>liberties of the world</hi>—and then do you begin.

               <head>26. An account of Mrs. Price of Stanemore.</head>
               <p> In this happy manner did we paſs the night in this wild and frightful part of the world, and for three ſucceeding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and days, enjoyed as much true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as it was poſſible for mortals to feel. <hi>Price</hi> was an ingenious, chearful, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining man, and his wife had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe more than ordinary, but was one of the beſt of women. I was prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed with her converſation. Tho' ſhe was no woman of letters, nor had any books in her houſe except the <hi>Bible, Barrow</hi>'s and <hi>Wichcott</hi>'s ſermons, <hi>Howell</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> and the <hi>Hiſtory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet from theſe few, a great memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and an extraordinary conception of things, had collected a valuable knowledge, and ſhe talked with an eaſe and perſpicuity that was wonderful. On religious ſubjects ſhe aſtoniſhed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The nature, end, and deſign of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</label> As Sunday was one of the days I ſtayed there,  and <hi>Price</hi> was obliged in the afternoon to be from home, I paſſed it in converſation with his wife. The day introduced religion,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0028500100:135"/>and among other things, I aſked her, which ſhe thought the beſt evidences of chriſtianity? The <hi>prophecies</hi> or the <hi>miracles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither: (Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> replyed). The <hi>prophecies</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> recorded in the old teſtament are a good proof of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it is plane from many inſtances in the new teſtament, that the <hi>Jewiſh converts</hi> of that generation underſtood them to relate to our Lord; which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon for our believing them. Since they knew the true intent and meaning of them, and on account of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, were converted; the <hi>prophecies</hi> for this reaſon ſhould by us be regarded as <hi>divine teſtimony</hi> in favor of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—Then as to <hi>miracles,</hi> they are to be ſure a means of proving and ſpreading the chriſtian religion, as they ſhew the <hi>divine miſſion</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and rouze the mind to attend to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by which theſe mighty works were wrought. Thus <hi>miracle</hi> and <hi>prophecy</hi> ſhew the <hi>teacher came from God.</hi> They contribute to the eſtabliſhment of his kingdom, and have a tendency to produce that faith which puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart, and brings forth the new birth.</p>
               <p>But the greater evidence for the truth of our holy religion, appears to me to be that which converted the primitive chriſtians, to wit, the <hi>powerful influence</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> has on the minds of thoſe who ſtudy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0028500100:136"/>it with ſincerity, and the <hi>inward diſcoveries</hi> Chriſt makes to the underſtanding of the faithful by his light and good ſpirit. This exceeds the other evidences, if the heart be honeſt. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is irreſiſtible, when the <hi>ſpirit of God moves</hi> upon the minds of chriſtians. When the <hi>divine power,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> aſſiſts and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us to do good, and to eſchew evil, then chriſtianity appears a religion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, and in itſelf the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. The compleat ſalvation deſerves our ready acceptation. That religion muſt charm a reaſonable world, which not only reſtores the worſhip of the <hi>one true God,</hi> and exhibits, in a perfect plan, thoſe rules of moral rectitude, whereby the conduct of men ſhould be governed, and their future happineſs ſecured; but, by its <hi>bleſſed ſpirit,</hi> informs our judgments, influences our wills, rectifies and ſubdues our paſſions, turns the biaſs of our minds from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and pleaſures of ſenſe, and fixes them upon the <hi>ſupreme good.</hi> Moſt glorious ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſuch a goſpel.</p>
               <p>But does not this <hi>operation of the ſpirit,</hi> (I ſaid) which you make the principal evidence for chriſtianity, debaſe human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and make man too weak, too helpleſs and depending a being? If <hi>voluntary good agency</hi> depends on <hi>ſupernatural influence</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0028500100:137"/>and <hi>enlivening aid,</hi> does not this make us <hi>mere patients,</hi> and if we are not <hi>moral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> that is, have not a power of chuſing or refuſing, of doing or avoiding, either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> can there be any human virtue? Can we in ſuch caſe <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>diſapprove</hi> our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God. To me it ſeems that man was created to perform things <hi>natural, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and has an ability to act within the reach of his agency, as his duty requires. I think the <hi>moral fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of things</hi> is a <hi>rule</hi> of action to conduct our actions by, and that the great advantage of revelation conſiſts in its heavenly moral leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the certainty of that <hi>future judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>retribution,</hi> which has a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence upon a rational mind, and ſtrongly inclines a reaſonable being to <hi>ſave his ſoul,</hi> by ſo acting in this world, as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void everlaſting miſery, and enſure the favor of God, and eternal happineſs in another world. This appears to me more conſiſtent with the <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>things.</hi> It is more to the honour of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, if I miſtake not, and gives more glory to God.</p>
               <p>To this Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> anſwered, that as ſhe was ſenſible of the ſhortneſs of her own underſtanding, and believed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the human mind in general were weak and deficient, ſhe could not ſee any thing unreaſonable in ſuppoſing the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0028500100:138"/>thing formed depended on, and was ſubject to the Creator that made it. It cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd ſurely to ſay, that ſo weak and helpleſs a being as a man, depends intirely on God. Where in the nature of things can we fix a ſtandard of certainty in underſtanding, and ſtability in practice, but in the fountain of truth, and all perfection?</p>
               <p>But to our better comprehending this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us take a view of primitive Chriſtian religion.—<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is a divine inſtitution, by which God declares himſelf reconciled to mankind for the <hi>ſake</hi> of his beloved ſon, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> on condition of <hi>repentance, amendment of life,</hi> and <hi>perſeverance in a ſtate of holineſs;</hi> and that we might be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the things required of us, he offers the aſſiſtance of his good ſpirit. This laſt offer, in a proper ſenſe, is ſalvation; <hi>for according to his mercy, he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. By grace are ye ſaved thro' faith, and that not of yourſelves; it is the gift of God.</hi> We find, then, that there are two parts in the Chriſtian religion: one, <hi>external and hiſtorical;</hi> the other, <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental.</hi> The firſt comprehends what is no more to be repeated, tho' the effects are laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and permanent, to wit, the life and good works of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his miracles, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; which declare him <hi>ſpotleſs virtue,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0028500100:139"/>perfect obedience,</hi> and the <hi>ſon of God with power:</hi>—And in the ſecond part, we have that ſtanding experience of a <hi>divine help,</hi> which converts and ſupports a ſpiritual life: It is true, both the parts have a near relation, and in conjunction produce the good ends of religion. The ſecond is the effect of the firſt. Redemption from the power of ſin, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and juſtification, are bleſſings <hi>wrought in us</hi> by the <hi>good Spirit</hi> of him, who <hi>without us</hi> did many glorious things, <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works:</hi> And, <hi>that they who live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them and roſe again.</hi> But, it is in the ſecond part, that the excellence of our holy religion conſiſts. We have no ability of ourſelves to take off our minds from the things that are evil, and engage them in the work of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and godlineſs. This is the <hi>gift</hi> of God. It is a <hi>continued miracle</hi> that cleanſes that pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted fountain the heart, and therefore I call this <hi>experience</hi> the principal evidence of the Chriſtian religion. It is the glory of chriſtianity, and renders it the perfection of all religions.</p>
               <p>That chriſtianity (I replyed) is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all religions, is granted, but that we have no ability to ſave our ſouls without a <hi>ſupernatural operation</hi> on them, this is what I ſtill have ſome doubt of. A careful exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0028500100:140"/>of the ſubject, produces ſome hard objections, and therefore, madam, I will lay my difficulties before you, that your fine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural underſtanding may remove them, if it be poſſible. I will be ſhort on the article, for many words would only darken it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, then, as to man's <hi>inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to live a religious life, and practice the precepts of the goſpel, it muſt be the effect of the <hi>human compoſition,</hi> or the effect of the agency of the <hi>ſerpent.</hi> If the former, it is chargeable upon the author of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; —if the latter, upon the agent which acts upon it. Man could not be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, I think, for a bad life, in either caſe. —If my nature be weakneſs itſelf—or the ſerpent is ſuperior to me—what good can be required of me? can the ſupreme reaſon call for <hi>brick,</hi> where there are no materials to make it with? will you ſay, yes; becauſe he gives <hi>ſupernatural ability</hi> to perform. But then, can this be called man's action? It is the action of the author by his miſerable creature, man: and in ſuch caſe, may we not ſay, that tho' <hi>commands</hi> are given to <hi>man</hi> to obey revealed laws, yet the <hi>obedience</hi> is performed by <hi>God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, as man in his <hi>natural capacity,</hi> and all his <hi>natural powers,</hi> are the work of God, and as <hi>truly derived</hi> from him as any <hi>ſupernatural powers</hi> can be, it follows,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0028500100:141"/>I imagine, that a <hi>voluntary agent</hi>'s making a right uſe of the <hi>powers of his nature,</hi> is as <hi>valuable</hi> as his being <hi>compelled</hi> to act well and wiſely by a ſupernatural power. To aſſert, then, ſuch <hi>experiences</hi> or <hi>operations,</hi> to me ſeems to <hi>miſrepreſent</hi> the nature of a being excellently conſtituted to anſwer the good purpoſes he was created for. I am likewiſe, at preſent, of opinion, that <hi>depretiating our natural abilities,</hi> does not give ſo much glory to God as you imagine.</p>
               <p>To this Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> replyed, that by the <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> ſhe did not mean that man was purely paſſive, and had no part in the working out his ſalvation, but that God <hi>co-operates</hi> with <hi>man,</hi> and without deſtroying the faculty of reaſon, improves it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and enlightning the underſtanding, and by moving and inclining the will towards ſuch objects as are acceptable to himſelf, and from thoſe that are contrary to his goſpel. The mind in this manner enlightned and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, begins to act, and as the ſpirit moves upon the ſoul, the quickened man, under the divine direction, does all the good the ſcripture commands him to do, and eſchews the evil he is ordered to avoid. By God thro' Chriſt, he practices the excellent virtues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the holy books, and for this reaſon, the righteouſneſs which chriſtians bring forth, is called in ſcripture, the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0028500100:142"/>of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs of God, and the righteouſneſs of faith. Chriſt is the efficient. We thro' him are made able to act. Notwithſtanding the weakneſs and incapacity of our nature, yet <hi>thro' faith in the power of God,</hi> which is given to all who believe in him, we are enabled to flee immorality and vice, and by a life of virtue and piety, to enjoy the pleaſure of a ſweet reflexion, and the praiſes of unpolluted reaſon.</p>
               <p>That this is the caſe of man, the ſacred writings declare in a thouſand places, and ſet forth the exceeding greatneſs of God's power in this reſpect. The miniſtry of the goſpel appears to have been ordained for this end, and the perfection of the chriſtian religion, to reſt on this particular thing. <hi>The Lord died for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that we through power received from him, (the power of his reſurrection) might be made righteous.</hi> And the apoſtle adds, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the power of God unto ſalvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek, for therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith.</hi> And that the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt had reference not only to the great effuſion of the Spirit at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which was a ſolemn confirmation of the new and ſpiritual diſpenſation of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0028500100:143"/>goſpel; but alſo to that inſtruction which Chriſtians of every age were to receive from it continually, if they attended to it, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the promiſe of <hi>Chriſt,—I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter,</hi> (the ſpirit of truth) <hi>that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> This ſpirit was to ſupply the place of his perſonal preſence. It was to become a teacher and comforter to his diſciples and followers to the end of time— to enlighten and incline their minds to piety and virtue—to enable them to do all things appertaining to life and godlineſs, and to have a faith in God's power and all-ſufficiency. This is the glorious ſpecific difference of Chriſtianity from all other religions. We have an inward inſtructor and ſupporter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abiding with us. And what can be a higher honor to mankind, or an act of greater love in God, than for him to interpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and by his holy Spirit reſtore the teachable and attentive to that purity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs in which he at firſt created man? Glorious diſpenſation! Here is a compleat reparation of the loſs ſuſtained by tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We are created anew in Chriſt Jeſus, and are made partakers of the divine nature. Surely this is the utmoſt that can be expected from religion. In ſhort, (continued Mrs. <hi>Price</hi>) it is to me a moſt amazing thing, to ſee men of ſenſe diſclaim this <hi>help,</hi> argue for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0028500100:144"/>
                  <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency</hi> and <hi>independency,</hi> and receive only the <hi>outward appearance</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> in a literal, hiſtorical, and formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of chriſtianity! This will never do the work. The <hi>outward appearance</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> only puts us in a <hi>capacity of ſalvation:</hi> it is the <hi>inward appearance</hi> by the power and virtue of the ſpirit that muſt <hi>ſave</hi> us. The <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>goſpel</hi> is <hi>repentance, forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> and <hi>amendment of manners;</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> of obtaining that end, is <hi>chriſtianity in the life, ſpirit and power of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You talk extremely well, madam, (I ſaid) upon this ſubject, and have almoſt made me a convert to the notion of an <hi>inward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of the <hi>Son of God:</hi> but I muſt beg leave to obſerve to you, that as to what you have added, by way of explication and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> to wit, that man has <hi>agency,</hi> and God <hi>co-operates</hi> with it, by which means the man is enabled to apply his agency to the performance of good; this does not ſeem to me to make the matter quite plain. The virtue or goodneſs of an <hi>agent</hi> muſt certainly ariſe from a right exerciſe of his own power, and how then can God's <hi>co-operating</hi> with him make him a better man? Can ſuch <hi>co-operation</hi> add any thing to my virtue, if my goodneſs is to be rated in proportion to the exertion of my own will and agency. If I am not able to ſave a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0028500100:145"/>man from drowning, tho' I pity him, and do my beſt to preſerve his life; but God gives me ſtrength, or co-operates with me, and ſo the man is ſaved; can this add any thing to my virtue or goodneſs? It would be indeed an inſtance of God's goodneſs to the man; but as to myſelf, I did no more with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine co-operation than I did without it. I made all the uſe I could of what power I had. This ſeems to me a ſtrong objection againſt the <hi>inward appearance:</hi> nor is it all there is to object. If I ſee a man in a deep wet ditch, in a dangerous and miſerable way, and am prompted by a natural affection, and the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of relieving, to exert a ſufficient ſtrength I have, to take the man out of his diſtreſs, and put him in a comfortable way; (which is a thing I really did once, and thereby ſaved a uſeful life);—in this caſe, there was good done by an <hi>agent,</hi> without any <hi>ſupernatural co-operation</hi> at all: Many more inſtances might be produced: but from what has been ſaid, is it not plain, that much good may be done without any interpoſition;—and, with it, that no good can be added to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the agent?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, perhaps, that the <hi>good diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>agent</hi> in ſuch caſes, is <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural operation,</hi> and without ſuch operation, he could not make a right uſe of his ability. To this we reply, that if by <hi>diſpoſition</hi> is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0028500100:146"/>meant <hi>a given power to diſtinguiſh betwixt motive and motive,</hi> and <hi>ſo to judge of moral fitneſs and unfitneſs;</hi> or, <hi>a power to act from right motives, when ſuch are preſent to the mind;</hi>—theſe cannot be given, becauſe they are the powers which conſtitute a man a <hi>moral agent,</hi> and render him accountable for his actions. Without them he could not be a ſubject of moral government.</p>
               <p>And if you mean by the term diſpoſition, God's <hi>preſenting ſuch motives to the mind, as are neceſſary to excite to right action;</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that tho' God may kindly interpoſe, and in many inſtances, by <hi>ſupernatural ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> preſent ſuch motives to the mind, yet ſuch operation cannot be always neceſſary, in order to our doing good.—In many caſes we ſee at once what good ought to be done, and we do it inſtantly of ourſelves, unleſs the natural faculties be perverted by falſe principles. If our fellow-creature falls into the fire, or has a fit, while we are near him, the fitneſs of relieving him, and the natural compaſſion eſſential to our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will make us fly to his aſſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>ſupernatural operation.</hi> We want no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine impulſe to make us interpoſe. Without being <hi>reminded,</hi> we will do our beſt to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the man, if ſuperſtition or paſſion hath not miſled the natural powers of the mind. In a great variety of things, the caſe is the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0028500100:147"/>ſame, and when at a <hi>glance</hi> we <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of action, there is an immediate production of good.</p>
               <p>It is not juſt then to aſſert that the heart cannot be the ſpring of good actions, without the actings of God. It is the ſeat and ſource of <hi>both evil</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> Man is capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving glory to God, and of doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He is conſtituted to anſwer all the purpoſes of ſocial felicity, and to act a part ſuitable to, and becoming that reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which God hath given him to guide his ſteps; and he may, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by abuſing his liberty, act an unſocial part in the creation, and do great diſhonour to his Maker, by the evil imaginations of his heart, and the violence his hand commits. This hath been the ſtate of human nature from the <hi>fall</hi> to the flood, and from the flood to our time. The human race have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ability for good or evil, and are at liberty for the choice of either of theſe. <hi>If thou doeſt well, Cain,</hi> who haſt <hi>power,</hi> and is at <hi>liberty</hi> to do evil, thou ſhalt be accepted. <hi>And if thou doeſt not well,</hi> who haſt <hi>power,</hi> and is at <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>do good, ſin lieth at the door.</hi> If this had not been the caſe of <hi>Cain,</hi> (and of others ſince his days), it ſeems to me at preſent, that God would act an <hi>unequal</hi> part with his creatures. Can <hi>happineſs</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> be called <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>puniſhment,</hi> unleſs
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0028500100:148"/>the creature can <hi>voluntarily</hi> chuſe or avoid the thing which renders him the object of infliction or glory? I think not. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> The <hi>agency</hi> of a <hi>ſerpent</hi> will be no plea then, for a <hi>Cain,</hi> I ſuppoſe: nor will <hi>Abel</hi>'s title to an inheritance depend only on the good brought forth in him by the Lord.—And as to a <hi>ſelf-ſufficiency</hi> or <hi>independency</hi> in all this, as often charged, I can ſee none, for the reaſon already given, to wit, that my <hi>natural powers</hi> are as much the gift of God to me as <hi>ſupernatural powers</hi> can be, and render me as <hi>dependent</hi> a being. They are <hi>derived</hi> from him: It is <hi>his given powers</hi> I uſe, and if I make a right uſe of them, to anſwer the great and wiſe purpoſe I was created for, the <hi>good application</hi> muſt be as <hi>valuable</hi> as if I had applied ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>What you ſay, ſir, (Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> anſwered) has reaſon in it, to be ſure: but it ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the language of the Bible, and takes away the <hi>Grace of God</hi> intirely, and the principal evidence of the Chriſtian religion: As to the <hi>neceſſary guilt</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays;—<hi>and God ſaw, that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth; and that every imagination of the thoughts of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0028500100:149"/>his heart, was only evil continually: and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented the Lord, that he had made man on the earth, etc.</hi> 
And again;—<hi>The earth alſo was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence: and God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had corrupted his way on the earth. And God ſaid unto Noah, the end of all fleſh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence thro' them; and behold, I will deſtroy them with the earth. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</hi>—The prophet Jeremiah does likewiſe affirm, <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares from Pſalm 14 and 53. <hi>There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open ſepulchre; with their tongues have they uſed deceit; the poiſon of aſps is under their lips: whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſs. Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood. Deſtruction and miſery are in their ways. And the way of peace have they not known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then as to <hi>grace,</hi> or the <hi>operation of the Spirit,</hi> to cure this <hi>miſerable condition of mankind, Peter ſaid unto them, repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0028500100:150"/>the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, for the promiſe is unto you and your children, and to all that are afar off.</hi> This is a very extenſive declaration both as to time and place. After <hi>Peter</hi> had told the people, <hi>the God of our fathers raiſed up Jeſus whom ye ſlew, and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins, and we are his witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo alſo is the Holy Ghoſt, whom God hath given to them that obey him:</hi> the apoſtle adds, <hi>then they, (the Gentiles) were filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> All who obeyed, without diſtinction, had the Holy Ghoſt given them, and it was a witneſs to them of the truth of Chriſt's divine miſſion, and the good effects of it, according to the promiſe of the Lord, to wit, <hi>he ſhall teſtify of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe tells us, <hi>if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſs; but if the ſpirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore brethren, we are debtors, not to the fleſh to live after the fleſh, for if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die; but if ye thro' the ſpirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live. For
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0028500100:151"/>as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſons of God. For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father, the ſpirit itſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</hi>—Here we ſee the neceſſity of having the ſpirit of Chriſt, and that thoſe who have it not, do not belong to him. They are none of his. We may likewiſe obſerve, that it mortifies the deeds of the body, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the ſoul to a life of holineſs: the paſſage likewiſe ſhews, that the ſpirit bears witneſs with our ſpirits, and by an evidence peculiar to itſelf, gives us a certain ſenſe, or underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Sir, a great number of texts might be produced, to ſhew not only the <hi>work</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>Divine ſpirit</hi> upon our minds; but that, it is an <hi>evidence,</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal evidence and ground of <hi>certainty</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> reſpecting the truth of chriſtianity. I will mention however only two or three more, and then ſhall be glad to hear what you ſay to thoſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What man knoweth the ſpirit of man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God. Now we have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0028500100:152"/>given to us of God.—Ye have an unction from the Holy one, and ye know all things. Theſe things have I written to you, concerning them that ſeduce you; but the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any teach you, but as the ſame anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in it.—Hereby we know that he abideth in us by his ſpirit, which he hath given us. Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What do you ſay to all this? do not the ſacred paſſages I have repeated ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the planeſt manner the <hi>neceſſary iniquity</hi> of man; that this is to be cured only, and his nature rectified by the operation of the Divine ſpirit; and that the <hi>effuſion</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> both as to <hi>inſtruction</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> was not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the infancy of chriſtianity? This appears to my underſtanding. The very eſſence of the chriſtian religion I think from theſe ſcriptures conſiſts in the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy</hi> of the <hi>ſpiritual principle.</hi>

               <head>The ſtate of religion from the creation to this time.</head>
               <p>What you have ſaid madam,  (I replied) ſeems ſtrong indeed in defence of the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> and the <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and I ſhould be of your way of thinking as to the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of it, but that I imagine the thing may be explained in a different
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0028500100:153"/>manner. Let us review our religion, if you pleaſe, and perhaps we may find, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother account may be given of ſanctification, and the renewing the mind into a ſtate of holineſs.</p>
               <p>When God called this world into being, his purpoſe was without all peradventure, that his rational creatures might enjoy the nobleſt pleaſures, and by conforming their conduct to the fitneſs and relation of things, from a due regard to the authority of the firſt cauſe, by whom this fitneſs and relation were wiſely conſtituted, ſecure all the bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this life, and honour, and glory, and immortality, in ſome future ſtate of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This I think was the caſe. True religion was to form and fix every good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the human mind, produce all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the converſation, and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mankind the bleſſed of the univerſal Father. They were to worſhip the one true God; the poſſeſſor of all being, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all good; to believe in him, and have their truſt and dependence always on him; to be pure and peaceable, gentle and full of mercy, without partiality, without hypocriſy, and ſo devoted to holineſs and obedience, to every virtue and every good work which the law of reaſon can require from men; that after a long life ſpent in acting a part the moſt honourable to God, and the moſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0028500100:154"/>advantageous to mankind, in <hi>obeying the dictates of reaſon,</hi> and <hi>thereby imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the example of God;</hi> they might be tranſlated to the regions of immortality and day, where the firſt and great original diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays as it were face to face the perfections of the Deity, and from an all-perfect and holy being receive the vaſt rewards he has prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thoſe, who, in this firſt ſtate, have been to all the purpoſes of life and religion, perfect as he is perfect. For theſe reaſons did the ſupreme director, the greateſt and the beſt Being in the univerſe, command the human race into exiſtence. He gave them faculties to conduct them here through various ſcenes of happineſs to the realms of immortality and immutable felicity. It was a <hi>Godlike</hi> deſign.</p>
               <p>But it was not very long before this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race became corrupt, and not only did evil in the ſight of the Lord, but ceaſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> as <hi>one moſt perfect mind.</hi> The natural notions of moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which reaſon and the light of nature ſupply, they no longer minded, nor thought of what is fit and reaſonable to be done in every caſe. The paſſions began to influence and direct their lives: juſt and pure ideas of the Deity were loſt, falſe ones took place, and the miſchief and its fatal conſequences became very great. It was a melancholy
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0028500100:155"/>ſcene! The exalted notions of <hi>one glorious God,</hi> and of that true religion which ſubſiſts in the expectation of a future ſtate, were no longer known, nor did the race ever think of approving themſelves in the eye of an <hi>all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and holy being.</hi> Superſtition and iniquity prevailed, and the ſpread of evil was wide.</p>
               <p>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth—the thoughts of his heart, evil continually, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you have before quoted from the book of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wickedneſs of the <hi>tenth generation</hi> was ſo great, and men no longer endeavoured after thoſe perfections, which are natural and proper to rational minds;—no longer thought of conforming themſelves to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, or ſtrove to imitate the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of it, tho' conſtituted to <hi>give glory</hi> to their <hi>Maker,</hi> and endued with a <hi>reaſon and underſtanding ſufficient</hi> to teach them the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>duty,</hi> and guide their ſteps in the ways of true religion; but againſt the light of their own minds, acted the moſt impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable part; therefore God repented that he had made them, that is, he did what is the product of repentance in men, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, as far as it is in their power, what they repent of, and deſtroyed his own work by that deſolating judgment, the <hi>flood.</hi> This ſeems to be the truth of the caſe. The words of <hi>Moſes</hi> do not mean the <hi>ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0028500100:156"/>nature</hi> on account of the <hi>fall.</hi> They expreſs only the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of the <hi>tenth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> as a <hi>reaſon</hi> for the <hi>deluge</hi> at that time. There is not the leaſt ground for aſſerting from this paſſage in the ſacred hiſtorian, that man was unable to do good by his natural powers, and that his crimes were a reſiſting the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God upon his mind. The impiety of this generation was a mere abuſe of free will, and acting againſt the plain dictates of their own minds: therefore, when wilful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and ſenſuality filled the earth, God deſtroyed the world by an inundation. <hi>Noah</hi> only, who was a juſt man, and perfect in his generation, with his family eſcaped.</p>
               <p>This terrible execution of an awful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on the guilty race, demonſtrated to the ſurvivors, and to all the ages to come, the great malignity of ſin, and the uncontrolable ſupremacy of the divine government. As the venerable Patriarch and his family failed over the boſom of the boundleſs ocean of waters, and above the wrecks and ruins of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial world, they adored to be ſure with grateful hearts, the Almighty Father of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodneſs, who had ſo wonderfully preſerved them, and were convinced by the amazing, ſtriking evidence, that ſin is the greateſt infamy and degradation of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature; that it has an inſuperable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy and irreverſible contrariety, to our
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0028500100:157"/>true happineſs, and is infamous, pernicious, and ruinous, by the ſentence of the Almighty. The dreadful event unanſwerably evinced his conſtant actual cognizance of enormous faith and manners, and his unchangeable diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with them. This truth, which was learnt at firſt, by the expulſion from <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> and the ſad inheritance of <hi>Mortality,</hi> they ſaw again republiſhed in the moſt awful manner. This gave undoubtedly a very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious turn to their minds, and they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be ſure to adhere to thoſe excellent principles and practices, which had been, thro' God's goodneſs, their ſecurity in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſolation, and to flee the contrary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ones which had procured that deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the reſt. In a degree ſuitable to their nature and ability, they reſolved to imitate the perfections of God, and to employ the powers and faculties of reaſon in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be juſt, and righteous, and merciful. And as the amazing operation of God in the deluge called for their wonder and praiſe, we muſt think their hearts glowed with the ſenſe of his goodneſs to them, and that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled his mercy and power in the ſalvation they had received. So we are told by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writer. <hi>Noah</hi> reſtored the antient rites of divine ſervice, and built an altar to the Lord. <hi>And the Lord ſmelled a ſweet Savour, and ſaid, Never any more will I curſe the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0028500100:158"/>ground for man's ſake, tho' the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;</hi> becauſe he will not hearken to the voice of reaſon, and with the greateſt ardor and contention of mind, labour to attain a conformity to the divine nature in the moral perfections of it; which is the true dignity of man, and the utmoſt excellence of human ſouls. <hi>Neither will I again ſmite any more every living creature as I have done. While the earth remaineth, ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and harveſt, and cold and heat, and ſummer and winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did God enter into a covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> and his ſons, and their ſeed; and as the late amazing occurrences muſt incline the ſpectators of the <hi>flood</hi> to piety and goodneſs; and the fathers of the poſtdiluvian world were careful to inſtruct their children in the ſeveral parts of the ſtupendous fact, and from the whole inculcate the Being and Perfections of God, his univerſal dominion and actual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and government over all things, his love of virtue and goodneſs and infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of all ſin; to which we may add, that the imitation of God is not a new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple introduced into religion by revelation, but has its foundation in the reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things;—we may from hence conclude, that the riſing generation were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of conſpicuous devotion, and followed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0028500100:159"/>after the moral virtues, the holineſs, juſtice and mercy which the light of nature diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. They were, I believe, moſt excellent mortals for ſome time. They <hi>obeyed</hi> to be ſure <hi>every dictate</hi> of reaſon, and <hi>adored</hi> and <hi>praiſed</hi> the <hi>inviſible Deity;</hi> the <hi>Supreme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this beautiful ſcene had an end, and man once more forgot his Maker and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He proſtituted the honor of both, by robbing God of the obedience due to him, and by ſubmitting himſelf a ſlave to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world. When he looked up to the heavens, and ſaw the glory of the ſun and ſtars, inſtead of praiſing the Lord of all, he fooliſhly ſaid, Theſe are thy Gods, O Man! A univerſal apoſtacy from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive religion prevailed. They began with the <hi>heavenly bodies,</hi> or <hi>ſydereal Gods,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>heroes, brutes,</hi> and <hi>images,</hi> till the world was overflowed with an inundation of <hi>idolatry,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition;</hi> even ſuch <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as nouriſhed under the notion of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and pleaſing the Gods, the moſt <hi>beſtial</hi> impurities, the moſt inhuman and unnatural <hi>cruelties,</hi> and the moſt unmanly and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible <hi>follies.</hi> Moral virtue and goodneſs were totally extinguiſhed. When men had loſt the ſenſe of the ſupreme Being, the <hi>Creator, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> of the world, they not only ceaſed to be righteous and holy, but became
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0028500100:160"/>neceſſarily vitious and corrupt in practice; for iniquity flows from corrupt religion, as the waters from the ſpring. The principles and ceremonies of the eſtabliſhed idolatries gave additional ſtrength to mens natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, to intemperance, luſt, fraud, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and every kind of unrighteouſneſs and debauchery. Long before the days of <hi>Moſes</hi> this was the general caſe. Idolatry had violated all the duties of true religion, and the moſt abominable practices by conſtitution were authoriſed.

Thoſe women who excel in beauty and ſhape are ſoon diſmiſſed; but the deformed are ſometimes neceſſitated to wait three or four years, before they can ſatisfy the law. The men declared their choice by throwing money into the lap of the woman they moſt admired, which ſhe was by no means to refuſe, but inſtantly retire with the man that accoſted her, and fulfil the law.

               </p>
               <p>Yet how fit ſoever ſuch a viſible mark might be, to keep in remembrance the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and the family of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> it was found in experience, inſufficient to preſerve them from the idolatrous cuſtoms of their neighbours.—Some new laws, ſome further conſtitutions of worſhip were to be added, or, as the family of <hi>Abraham</hi> were ſituated in the midſt of idolaters and unrighteous ones, it was foreſeen they would ſoon fall from the eſſentials of religion; and inſtead of preſerving a right knowledge of God, of his Being, Perfections and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>But as mankind would not follow the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> which is ſufficient, when attended to, for a conſtant univerſal practice of piety and morality; ſo neither would they be engaged by various reveled laws, from time to time given, and by the calls and leſſons of many prophets, to the practice of true religion and righteouſneſs; but as the <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>ſeat</hi> and <hi>ſource</hi> of <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in man, according to the prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſo even the <hi>hearts</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> became <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> And the <hi>Prophet</hi> goes on to ſhew, not the <hi>neceſſary inability</hi> of man <hi>without experiences,</hi> or an <hi>operating ſpirit within,</hi> (as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, madam); but that, tho' men thus wickedly deceive one another, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly by ſuch a wilful deſperate piece of wickedneſs deceive their Maker, becauſe to him the moſt ſecret receſſes of their hearts lie open; and, conſequently, in the iſſue, they deceive themſelves, ſeeing God, who knows the deceit which is lodged in their hearts, will render unto them according to their works, and according to the fruit of their doings: ſo that their hope and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will be <hi>diſappointed,</hi> even as a partridge is diſappointed that ſitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0028500100:167"/>And as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays from the xiv. and liii. pſalm, there was none righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God; and ſo on, as you madam, have quoted the verſes, in which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not intend to ſhew the <hi>neceſſary pollution</hi> of <hi>man</hi> without the <hi>help</hi> of <hi>grace;</hi> but the <hi>groundleſsneſs</hi> of that opinion which the <hi>Jews</hi> had gone into, that they were the <hi>only people</hi> which pleaſed God; for they were as guilty as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were in tranſgreſſing the law of nature. Neither of them had any <hi>legal title to juſtification.</hi> They were all very great tranſgreſſors. The <hi>throat</hi> of <hi>Jew and Gentile</hi> and <hi>open ſepulchre:</hi> their tongues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: the poiſon of aſps under their lips: their mouths, full of curſing and bitterneſs: their feet, ſwift to ſhed blood. Deſtruction and miſery in their ways: and the way of peace have they not known: Therefore the <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the <hi>Jew</hi> as well as the <hi>Gentile</hi> muſt be of <hi>grace,</hi> and not of debt.</p>
               <p>In this was manifeſted the ineſtimable love of God in the redemption of the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Tho' <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were qualified to <hi>diſcern</hi> and <hi>do</hi> both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and the <hi>Jew</hi> had a written law as a further aſſiſtance, but nevertheleſs they violated the plain dictates of natural reaſon, and the divine precepts of the law, and by unrighteouſneſs and impurity, rendered themſelves objects of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0028500100:168"/>judgment and condemnation; yet the father of the univerſe, in compaſſion to mankind, ſent a divine teacher from heaven, <hi>Chriſt, the true Prophet that was to come into the world,</hi> and by his divinely reveled teſtimony and authority, attempts to aboliſh the ſuperſtition of men, reclaim their wickedneſs, and bring them back to the true ſpiritual worſhip of God, and to that holineſs of life and manners which is agreeable to the uncorrupted light and dictates of nature. This was love. The bleſſed God, in compaſſion to human igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and wickedneſs, contracted by men's own fault, gives them an expreſs revelation of his will, and re-eſtabliſhes the rule of pure uncorrupt religion and morality. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares thoſe terms of ſinful man's reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him which he was pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Grace is manifeſted in the goſpel <hi>to turn men from their vanities, or idol ſervice, unto the living God, who made heaven and earth,</hi> and by the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works:—That denying all ungodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope, and the</hi> glorious appearance of the great God; who will judge the world by that divine perſon, and great temporary miniſter, whom he ſent before to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0028500100:169"/>deſtroy ſin, and the kingdom of Satan; and to bring mankind into a perfect obedience to the will of the <hi>ſupreme Being.</hi> This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders chriſtianity a heavenly thing. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thus explained is beautiful and uſeful to an extreme degree. It does not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, but ſtrengthens the obligations of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral religion.</p>
               <p>Your account, Sir, (Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> anſwered) of man and religion is different indeed from mine, and I muſt allow your explications have reaſon in them: but ſtill they do not ſatisfy me, nor can I part with my own opinion. Two things in particular to me appear very ſtrange in your ſcheme. It ſeems to take away the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain revelation, if natural religion, duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, was perfect, and ſufficient for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and holineſs, and thereby to gain the favor of God. If reaſon alone can do the work, if men pleaſe, then what need of the goſpel?—If men will conſider, (and without conſideration no ſcheme can be of ſervice), they may as well turn their thoughts to the law of nature as to the law of grace, if there is no difference betwixt the rule of nature and the law of Chriſt, with regard to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the maker of heaven and earth, and the worſhip due to him on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and the practice of virtue and mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0028500100:170"/>In the next place, if I underſtand you right, the grace of God is of no uſe at all in religion, as you account for ſalvation. What is out of order within us, in the mind and its faculties, the will and its affections, and wants to be ſet right in good thoughts and works, our own reaſon, in your notion of religion, is ſufficient to regulate, and unaſſiſted by the illumination of the holy ſpirit of God, we may live in an uncorrupted ſtate of piety and morality, and ſo ſave our ſouls, if we pleaſe. This is what I cannot believe. The grace of God in the goſpel is the glory and comfort of the chriſtian religion. A divine operation that renews and ſanctifies the mind is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable bleſſing, and in a manner inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly charming, ſatisfies me beyond heſitation, that the chriſtian religion is true, while it puts me in the actual poſſeſſion of the good effects of it. The ſpirit of God diſcovers to me the ſtate of my own mind, in all the circumſtances of a chriſtian life, ſets my follies, my neglects, and my failings, in order before me, which is the firſt right ſtep in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the overcoming them; and then obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the diſcoveries I was not able to make my ſelf, and having a ſtrong faith in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and ſufficiency, I am enabled to gain victories my inſufficient reaſon could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain. May this divine monitor then abide in my breaſt. It is by the heavenly aſſiſtance
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0028500100:171"/>of the holy ſpirit only, as vouchſafed in the chriſtian diſpenation, that I can ſecure for myſelf eternal life. The wiſe and prudent of this world may think as they pleaſe of this matter, and produce reaſonings againſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my power to anſwer; but for my part, I muſt conſider it as the <hi>principle</hi> of my <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and think I cannot be thankful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the ineſtimable bleſſing. It is to me a glorious inſtance of the great wiſdom and goodneſs of God.</p>
               <p>Madam, (I replyed) in relation to your firſt objection, that I make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reveled and natural religion, for nature is as ſufficient as grace, in my account, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that I think the revelation of the goſpel excels the beſt ſcheme of natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that could be propoſed; in declaring the terms of reconcilement, in demonſtrating the divine wrath againſt ſin, in the method of ſhewing mercy by the death of God's beloved Son, and the promiſe of free pardon on the condition of repentance and newneſs of life. This manner gives unſpeakable comfort to repenting ſinners. It gives the greateſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to engage them to the love of God and the practice of all his commandments; an encouragement that reaſon could not diſcover. To chriſtianity therefore the true preference is due. Tho' philoſophy or the doctrine of reaſon may reform men, yet the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0028500100:172"/>is a clearer and more powerful guide. It improves the light of reaſon by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural evidence and declaration of God's will, and the means of man's redemption is a more efficacious motive and obligation to univerſal obedience than nature could ever with certainty propoſe. A revelation that has the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt evidence of being the divine will, muſt be the moſt eaſy and effectual method of inſtruction, and be more noticed than the beſt human teaching: and this will of God being truly and faithfully committed to writing, and preſerved uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, muſt always be the beſt and ſureſt rule of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>manners.</hi> It is a rule abſolutely free from all thoſe errors and ſuperſtitions, both of belief and practice, which no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man compoſure was ever before free from, or, probably, would have been free from, without the aſſiſtance of ſuch a revelation. Nor is this all. This is not the only ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior excellence of our holy religion.</p>
               <p>A Mediator and crucified Redeemer brought into the Chriſtian revelation, has a noble effect on a conſidering mind, and ſhews the reaſonableneſs of the goſpel-diſpenſation. The wiſeſt and moſt rational heathens ever were for ſacrifices and mediators, as the greatneſs of God was thereby declared, and that not only ſin deſerved puniſhment, but mens lives to be forfeited by their breach of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0028500100:173"/>the divine laws: and when a divine perſon, <hi>made man, like unto us,</hi> appears inſtead of all other mediators, <hi>by whom,</hi> as the inſtrument of the means of ſalvation, we are to offer up our prayers to the Only true God; and his voluntary dying in teſtimony of the truth of his miſſion and doctrine, is appointed to be inſtead of all other ſacrifices, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a memorial that God requires no atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us, but <hi>repentance and newneſs of life;</hi> and the ſpotleſs virtues and obedience of this divine Redeemer, are to be a moſt perfect and moving example for us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;—this renders chriſtianity worthy of God, and makes it the perfection of religion. <hi>Great</hi> then are the <hi>advantages</hi> which the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> has <hi>above mere reaſon,</hi> darkened by the clouds of error and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption. It is the moſt perfect rule of life. It is the moſt powerful means to promote a conſtant uniform practice of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and piety. It advances human nature to its higheſt perfection, fills it with all the fruits of righteouſneſs, and grants us privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and bleſſings far ſuperior to what we could attain any other way.</p>
               <p>With regard to the ſecond objection, that I take away the grace of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the dignity of human nature, this is far from my intention. I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed think, that as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was given for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0028500100:174"/>the nobleſt purpoſe; to wit, to call in an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> manner upon mankind, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>idolatry,</hi> the corrupt creed of polytheiſm, the guilt of ſuperſtition, their great iniquities, violent paſſions, and worldly affections, which are all contrary to reaſon, and diſgrace human nature; and to practiſe that whole ſyſtem of morality, which they muſt know to be <hi>moſt uſeful</hi> to them;—that they might turn to a religion which had but <hi>One object,</hi> the Great Inviſible Being, all-knowing and all-ſufficient, to whom all the intelligent world are to make their devout applications; becauſe he is an infinite, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, ſovereign mind, who has created all things, and abſolutely rules and governs all; poſſeſſes all natural perfections, exiſts in all duration, fills all ſpace with his preſence, and is the omniſcient witneſs of all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and wants;—and that ſince they were bound by all the ties of moral duty to obey this one God, and obſerve the rational inſtitutions of religion, therefore they ſhould make it the labor of their whole lives to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in holineſs and righteouſneſs, and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and piety unite themſelves to God, and entitle themſelves to glory at the great day: —That as this is the nature, end, and deſign of the chriſtian revelation, ſo I do think the <hi>goſpel of our ſalvation,</hi> the <hi>word of truth,</hi> (as an apoſtle calls it) is ſufficient for the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0028500100:175"/>purpoſe, without <hi>immediate impulſes.</hi> As we have a reaſonable, intellectual nature, there is no want of mechanical powers. The words of Chriſt, which are the words of God, are, our life, and will, if attended to, and powerfully enable us to practiſe good works, and to excel, and perſevere therein. <hi>I can do all theſe things, through Chriſt, who ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> that is, through the written directions of Chriſt, and through the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and motives of the chriſtian doctrine. To ſay otherwiſe of the goſpel, is, in my opinion, injurious to it.</p>
               <p>God may, to be ſure, give <hi>ſpecial</hi> aids to men, whenever he thinks fit. He may, by an <hi>extraordinary agency,</hi> render our <hi>faculties</hi> more <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> where divine things are concerned:—may awaken <hi>a dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant idea,</hi> which lay neglected in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, with unuſual energy;—may ſecretly attract the <hi>more attentive regard</hi> of the mind, and give it <hi>an inclination</hi> and <hi>an ability</hi> of tracing its various relations, with an unuſual attention, ſo that a luſtre before quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſhall be (as it were) poured upon it; —the ſpirit of God may render the mind <hi>more ſuſceptible</hi> and <hi>more tenacious</hi> of divine knowledge; I believe he often does by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition,</hi> if in the ſpirit of Chriſt's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we aſk it of the great <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of all the <hi>underſtanding</hi> divided
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0028500100:176"/>among the various ranks of created Beings; who, as he firſt <hi>formed the minds of angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> continues the exerciſe of their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual faculties,</hi> and one way or another <hi>communicates</hi> to them <hi>all the knowledge</hi> of every kind which they poſſeſs; (in which view <hi>all our knowledge</hi> of every kind may be called <hi>a revelation from God,</hi> and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as it is by <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Almighty:)</hi> This the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> may do, and diſſipate a prejudice that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes truth. But this is not always neceſſary: nor always to be expected. It is evident from the <hi>goſpel,</hi> that our <hi>Lord</hi> rather ſpeaks of his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>doctrine,</hi> as the <hi>aids</hi> to ſave mens ſouls, than of himſelf, or ſpirit, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered. <hi>Abiding in him,</hi> and <hi>he in them,</hi> as neceſſary to their bearing fruit, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a ſtrict and ſteady regard to his word, and the influence of that upon our minds. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you; ye ſhall aſk what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you:</hi> that is, <hi>If you continue to believe in me, and to pay a ſteady regard to my doctrine, you will be highly acceptable to God.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0028500100:178"/>he will take us under his guardian care. He deſcended from Heaven, to deliver us from everlaſting ruin, he purchaſed us with the price of his own blood, and if we live up to the <hi>word</hi> of truth, he will conduct us ſafely through life and death, into the abode of holy and happy ſpirits, and at length raiſe our bodies from the duſt, and fix our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat perſons in a ſtate of immortal glory and felicity.—This is my ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> made no reply, and ſo end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this remarkable converſation. On whoſe ſide the truth is, the reader is to judge. What ſhe ſays for <hi>ſupernatural operation</hi> is ſtrong and pious to be ſure: and conſidering Mrs. <hi>Price</hi> had no learning, and was almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reading, I thought it very wonderful to hear her on this, and many other ſubjects. She was ſuch another genius as <hi>Chubb,</hi> but on the other ſide of the queſtion; if ſhe had been able to write as ſenſibly and correctly as ſhe talked on ſeveral articles of religion, ſhe would have made a good author.

               <p>The 13th of June 1725, I took my leave of my friend, <hi>John Price,</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wife, promiſing to viſit them again as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0028500100:179"/>ſoon as it was in my power,  and proceeded on my journey in queſt of Mr. <hi>Turner.</hi> I would not let <hi>Price</hi> go with me, on ſecond thoughts, as many ſad accidents might happen in this rough and deſolate part of the world, and no relief in ſuch caſe to be found. If I fell, there was no one belonging to me to ſhed a tear for me: but if a miſchief ſhould befall <hi>Jack Price,</hi> his wife would be miſerable indeed, and I the maker of a breach in the ſweeteſt ſyſtem of felicity that love and good ſenſe had ever formed. This made me refuſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated offers to accompany me. All I would have was a boy and horſe of his, to carry ſome proviſions wet and dry, as there was no public houſe to be found in aſcending thoſe tremendous hills, or in the deep vales through which I muſt go; nor any houſe that he knew of beyond his own.</p>
               <p>With the riſing ſun then I ſet out, and was charmed for ſeveral hours with the air and views. The mountains, the rocky precipices, the woods and the waters, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in various ſtriking ſituations every mile I travelled on, and formed the moſt aſtoniſhing points of view. Sometimes I was above the clouds, and then crept to inchanting vallies below. Here glins were ſeen that looked as if the mountains had been rent aſunder to form the amazing ſcenes: and there, foreſts and falling ſtreams covered the ſides of the hills. Rivers in many places, in the moſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0028500100:180"/>beautiful caſcades, were tumbling along; and cataracts from the tops of mountains came roaring down. The whole was grand, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and fine. On the top of one of the mountains I paſſed over at noon; the air was piercing cold, on account of its great height, and ſo ſubtle, that we breathed with difficulty, and were a little ſick. From hence I ſaw ſeveral black ſubjacent clouds big with thunder, and the lightning within them rolled backwards and forwards, like ſhining bodies of the brighteſt luſtre. One of them went off in the grandeſt horrors through the vale below, and had no more to do with the pike I was on than if it had been a ſummit in another planet. The ſcene was prodigious fine. <hi>Sub pedibus ventos &amp; rauca tonitrua calcat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Till the evening, I rid and walked it, and in numberleſs windings round unpaſſable hills, and by the ſides of rivers it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to croſs, journeyed a great many miles: but no human creature, or any kind of houſe, did I meet with in all the long way, and as I arrived at laſt at a beautiful lake, whoſe banks the hand of nature had adorned with vaſt old trees, I ſat down by this water in the ſhade to dine, on a neat's tongue I had got from good Mrs. <hi>Price;</hi> and was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ſtriking beauties and ſtillneſs of the place, that I determined to paſs the night in this ſweet retreat. Nor was it one
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0028500100:181"/>night only, if I had my will, that I would have reſted there. Often did I wiſh for a convenient little lodge by this ſweet water ſide, and that with the numerous ſwans, and other fowl that lived there, I might have ſpent my time in peace below, till I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the eſtabliſhed ſeat of happineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>

               <p> The lake I have mentioned was the largeſt I had ſeen in this wild part, being above a mile in length, and more than half a mile broad; and the water that filled it, burſt with the greateſt impetuoſity from the inſide of a rocky mountain, that is very wonderful to behold. It is a vaſt craggy precipice, that aſcends till it is almoſt out of ſight, and by its gloomy and tremendous air, ſtrikes the mind with a horror that has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſing in it. This amazing cliff ſtands perpendicular at one end of the lake, at the diſtance of a few yards, and has an opening at the bottom, that is wide enough for two coaches to enter at once, if the place was dry. In the middle of it, there is a deep channel, down which the water ruſhes with a mighty ſwiftneſs and force, and on either ſide, the ſtone riſes a yard above the impetuous ſtream. The aſcent is eaſy, flat and plane. How far it goes, I know not, being afraid to aſcend more than forty yards; not only on account of the terrors common to the place, from the fall of ſo much water with a ſtrange kind of roar, and the height of the arch which covers the torrent all the way; but becauſe as I went up, there was of a ſudden, an encreaſe of noiſe ſo very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that my heart failed me, and a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0028500100:184"/>almoſt diſabled me. The rock moved under me, as the frightful ſounds encreaſed, and as quick as it was poſſible for me, I came into day again. It was well I did; for I had not been many minutes out, before the water overflowed its channel, and filled the whole opening in ruſhing to the lake. The increaſe of the water, and the violence of the diſcharge, were an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight. I had a great eſcape.</p>

Where did this great water come from?—I anſwer, might it not flow from the great abyſs — and the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it, and the fearful noiſe, and the motion of the rock, be owing to ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commotion in the <hi>abyſs,</hi> occaſioned by ſome natural or ſupernatural cauſe?</p>

               <p> That there is ſuch an <hi>abyſs,</hi> no one can doubt that believes revelation, and from reaſon and hiſtory it is credible, that there are violent concuſſions on this vaſt collection
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0028500100:185"/>of water, by the divine appointment: and therefore, I imagine it is from thence the water of this mountain proceeds, and the great overflowing and terrifying ſound at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Nov. 1. 1755.</note>, in his book lately publiſhed, (called, The Philoſophy of Earthquakes), there are many things to be objected againſt its being the origin of ſuch calamities:—one objection is, and it is an inſuperable one, that electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſhocks are ever momentary, by every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, but earthquakes are felt for ſeveral minutes. Another is, that many towns have been ſwallowed up in earthquakes, tho' <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> was only overthrown. Such was the caſe of the city of <hi>Callao,</hi> within two leagues of <hi>Lima.</hi> Tho' <hi>Lima</hi> was only tumbled into ruins, October 28, 1746; yet <hi>Callao</hi> ſunk downright, with all its inhabitants, and an unfathomable ſea now covers the fineſt port in <hi>Peru,</hi> as I have ſeen on the ſpot.— In the earthquake at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> June 7, 1692, in which ſeveral thouſands periſhed, it is certain, that not only many houſes, and a great number of people, were intirely ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up; but that, at many of the gapings or openings of the earth, torrents of water that formed great rivers, iſſued forth. This
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0028500100:186"/>I had from a man of veracity then on the ſpot, who was an eye-witneſs of theſe things, and expected himſelf every minute to deſcend to the bowels of the earth, which heaved and ſwelled like a rolling ſea. Now to me the electrical ſtroke does not appear ſufficient to produce theſe things. The power of electricity, to be ſure is vaſt and amazing. It may cauſe great tremors and undulations of the earth, and bring down all the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a great city: but as to ſplitting the earth to great depths, and forcing up tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of water, where there was no ſign of the fluid element before, I queſtion much if the vehemence of the elemental electric fire does this.—Beſide, when mountains and cities ſink into the earth, and the deepeſt lakes are now ſeen to fill all the place where they once ſtood, as has been the caſe in many countries, where could theſe mighty waters come, but from the <hi>abyſs?</hi>—The great lake <hi>Oroquantur</hi> in <hi>Pegu,</hi> was once a vaſt city. In <hi>Jamaica,</hi> there is a large deep lake where once a mountain ſtood.—In an earthquake in <hi>China,</hi> in the province of <hi>Sanci,</hi> deluges of water burſt out of the earth, Feb. 7, 1556, and inundated the country for 180 miles. Many more inſtances of this kind I might produce, excluſive of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the ground of which was inundated by an irruption of waters from beneath, (which now forms the <hi>dead ſea)</hi> after the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0028500100:187"/>city was deſtroyed by fire from above; that the land which had been defiled with the unnatural luſts of the inhabitants might be no more inhabited, but remain a laſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the divine vengeance on ſuch crimes, to the end of the world: and the uſe I would make of thoſe I have mentioned, is to ſhew, that theſe mighty waters were from the furious concuſſion of the abyſs that cauſed the earthquakes. Electricity, I think, can never make ſeas and vaſt lakes to be where there were none before. <hi>Locherne,</hi> in the county of Fermanagh, in the province of <hi>Ulſter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is thirty three miles long, and fourteen broad, and as the old Iriſh chronicle informs us, was once a place where large and populous towns appeared, till for the great iniquity of the inhabitants, the people and their fair habitations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in an earthquake, and mighty waters from the earth covered the place, and formed this lake. Could the <hi>electrical ſtroke</hi> produce this ſea that was not to be found there before the deſtruction? Is it not more reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that ſuch vaſt waters have been forced by a ſupernatural commotion from the great abyſs, in the earthquake that deſtroyed the towns which once ſtood in this place?</p>
               <p>To this then, (till I am better informed), I muſt aſcribe ſuch earthquakes as produce great rivers and lakes: and where no waters appear, I believe the earthquakes are cauſed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0028500100:188"/>by the immediate finger of God; either operating on the abyſs, tho' not ſo as to make the water break out on the earth; or by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the electrical violence or ſtroke; or otherwiſe acting on the ruined cities and ſhattered places.</p>

               <p> For my part, I think it is a grievous miſtake in our philoſophical enquiries, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſo much to ſecond cauſes as the learned do. The government of the univerſe is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to matter and motion, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of extolling original contrivance, the execution of all is left to dead ſubſtance. It is juſt and reaſonable (even <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurin</hi> ſay) to ſuppoſe that the <hi>whole chain of cauſes,</hi> or the <hi>ſeveral ſeries of them,</hi> ſhould center in him, as their ſource and fountain; and the whole ſyſtem appear depending upon him, the only <hi>independent cauſe.</hi> Now to me this ſuppoſition does not appear either juſt or reaſonable. I think the noble <hi>phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of nature ought to be aſcribed to the <hi>immediate operation</hi> of the <hi>Deity.</hi> Without looking for a <hi>ſubtile elaſtic medium,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>gravity;</hi> which <hi>medium</hi> Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes he had no proof of; nor is there in reality ſuch a thing in the univerſe; I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the divine <hi>Newton</hi> would have done better, if, after eſtabliſhing the true ſyſtem of nature, by demonſtrating the law of <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> he had ſaid this <hi>gravity</hi> was the <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>undeniable evidence</hi> of the <hi>immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0028500100:189"/>of the <hi>Deity</hi> in the material univerſe. A <hi>ſeries</hi> of <hi>material cauſes</hi> betwixt <hi>Deity</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> is, in truth, concealing him from the knowledge of mortals for ever. In the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government of the world, ſecond cauſes do, becauſe <hi>free-agents</hi> act a part; but, in the material univerſe to apply them, to me ſeems improper, as matter and motion only, that is, <hi>mechaniſm,</hi> come in competition with the Deity. Moſt certainly he conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes. The Divine Power is perpetually put forth throughout all nature. Every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of matter, muſt neceſſarily, by its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for ever go wrong, without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued act of Deity. His everlaſting interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition only can cauſe a body moving in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to change the direction of its motion in every point. Nor is it poſſible for <hi>ſubtile matter,</hi> the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> cauſe of <hi>gravity,</hi> to know to impel bodies to a center, with qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple force at half the diſtance.</p>
               <p>And as in <hi>gravity,</hi> and in the <hi>coheſion</hi> of the <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> the Deity <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> in the motion of the celeſtial bodies, and in the reſiſtance the leaſt particles make to any force that would ſeparate them; ſo is his <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> power, I think for myſelf, exerted not only in <hi>earthquakes</hi> and <hi>tides,</hi> but in the <hi>circulations</hi> of the blood, lymph, and chyle, in muſcular motion, and in various other <hi>phoenomena</hi> that might be named.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0028500100:191"/>from the eaſtern and ſouthern ocean, round <hi>Good-Hope</hi> and <hi>Cape-Horn,</hi> it ſhould as ſoon overflow our coaſts, as when it is vertical to the ſhores of <hi>Guinea?</hi> — If the <hi>moon</hi> (in conjunction with the ſun) by <hi>preſſion</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi> was the principal cauſe of <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux,</hi> why is there no eſtabliſhed tide on the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea,</hi> though of a vaſt breadth, and two thouſand miles in length from the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> to the coaſts of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> but only ſome <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and unaccountable ſwellings and falls</hi> in a few places of this ſea, to wit, at <hi>Tunis, Meſſina, Venice,</hi> and <hi>Negropont;</hi> and theſe <hi>ſwellings,</hi> as I have ſeen, <hi>flowing</hi> ſometimes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 times in 24 hours; in the moſt irregular manner; againſt the fixed laws of <hi>preſſion</hi> and <hi>attraction,</hi> aſcribed to the <hi>moon</hi> and <hi>ſun,</hi> on a ſuppoſition of their cauſing the tides? — If <hi>preſſion,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrong attractive power</hi> of the <hi>moon,</hi> and the <hi>weaker influence</hi> of the <hi>ſun,</hi> forces the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ocean twice a day from its natural <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etus,</hi> and rolls it in tides, why has the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Sea no Tide;</hi> no ſwelling or flow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular or irregular, excepting that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in the ſpace of 16 years, and never ſooner, it riſes many fathoms, and drowns the adjacent country; to the almoſtruin, ſometimes, of <hi>Aſtracan</hi> in <hi>Aſiatick Ruſſia;</hi> as happened when I was there to embark for <hi>Perſia?</hi> — If it be ſaid, that this is properly a lake, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0028500100:192"/>no communication with the ocean; yet, I anſwer, that it is in every quality of ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>etc.</hi> as much a ſea as any other ſea; and large enough for the luminaries <hi>attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>preſſion;</hi> being 500 miles from north to ſouth, and near 400 miles in breadth from eaſt to weſt: I ſay, large enough to avoid continuing <hi>neceſſarily in equilibrio,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Rutherforth</hi> ſays muſt be the caſe, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſmall extent of this ſea. 500 by 400 miles of ſea does not require that ſuch a ſea ſhould preſs equally, or that the gravity of its water ſhould be equally diminiſhed in every part of it, and ſo out of the powers, <hi>addititious</hi> and <hi>ablatitious,</hi> of the luminary; that is, the force, with which the moon encreaſes the waters gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the force, with which the moon diminiſhes the waters gravity. If the <hi>moon</hi> in <hi>zenith</hi> or <hi>nadir</hi> did the work, the <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium</hi> of the the <hi>Caſpian</hi> might be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> as well as any other equilibrium of water, by force, <hi>addititious</hi> or <hi>ablatitious,</hi> or by the ſum of theſe forces: therefore, there might, by this theory, be tides in the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian ſea,</hi> tho' not great ones. There are ſmall as well as great tides. The tides of the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic</hi> ocean are inferior in every reſpect to thoſe of the larger <hi>Pacific</hi> ocean. A quarter of a great circle of the earth, that is, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ocean from eaſt to weſt 90°, is only
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0028500100:193"/>required, that the tides may have their full motion. A tide of leſs motion may be in ſuch an extent of ſea as the <hi>Caſpian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt place, how does the theory of tides account for the regular peculiarity of the flux and reflux of the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> different from all other tides; while at <hi>Bathſha</hi> in the kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> there never is more than one tide in 24 hours; and ſome days, no tide? — For my part, I reſolve the whole into the <hi>immediate power</hi> of the <hi>Deity. This power</hi> is <hi>gravity, attraction, repulſe.</hi> The <hi>inactivity</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> requires the <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>univerſality</hi> of <hi>divine power</hi> to ſupport the material univerſe, and move it as occaſion requires; that is, as infinite wiſdom ſees moſt conducive to the benefit of his creation.</p>

               <p>In the caſe of <hi>earthquakes,</hi> as <hi>electricity,</hi> or <hi>aerial power,</hi> is <hi>inſufficient</hi> to produce them, in my opinion, for two reaſons before given; to wit, that the <hi>electrical ſtroke</hi> is <hi>ever ſingle and momentary,</hi> but the <hi>vibrations</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0028500100:194"/>of the earth, in a quake, are often 3 <hi>and</hi> 4 <hi>minutes,</hi> and have held to 7 <hi>minutes</hi> — and that, beſides the ſwelling and trembling of the earth, it has ſo opened at thoſe times, as to ſwallow not only houſes and people, but even mountains, and to ſend forth great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and vaſt waters. And, as <hi>ſubterranean fire</hi> and <hi>vapor,</hi> I think, can never do ſuch work, for many reaſons that may be offered, we muſt, I think, aſcribe the earthquakes to the immediate impreſſion of divine power; by which a city is tumbled into ruins in three or four minutes, in the ſad manner <hi>Liſbon</hi> was deſtroyed the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> 1755. or, the water of the great abyſs is with ſuch violence moved, that it ſhakes the arches of the earth, and where infinite wiſdom directs, is enabled by Almighty Power to open the globe with tremendous noiſes, and pour forth vaſt torrents of water, to cover a land where once a flouriſhing city has ſtood. The elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric ſtroke cannot be more dreadful than ſuch exertion of omnipotence. The <hi>immediate action</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> muſt be as efficacious ſurely as any ſubordinate agent or cauſe: and it muſt be more terrible to the mind, as there can be no ſuppoſition of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ruin this way: but we ſee as it were the <hi>almighty arm,</hi> exerting an irreſiſtible force, that could in the ſame few moments
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0028500100:195"/>that a large town and its inhabitants are deſtroyed, ſhake the whole world into one dreadful ruin, or ſeparate it into nothing. To my apprehenſion, the aerial power of electricity is not ſo fearfully ſtriking, as the <hi>Creator</hi>'s appearing, on the ſpot, <hi>to ſhake terribly the earth:</hi> and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it is on account of <hi>ſin,</hi> that God reſigns his omnipotence to his wrath, and commands <hi>his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe,</hi> muſt not this account of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake have the greateſt tendency to reform the manners of the ſurviving people?</p>
               <p>
                  <label>An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of muſcular motion; and that it is cauſed by a continued act of the Deity.</label> As to muſcular motion,  if it be rightly conſidered, it appears very plainly to proceed from a <hi>living force,</hi> impreſſed <hi>ab extra;</hi> that <hi>mechaniſm does not act as cauſe</hi> in this affair; but the <hi>divine power acts in the caſe,</hi> as it does in many different places of the human body at once, and with inexpreſſible variety.</p>
               <p>Various are the accounts that learned men have given of muſcular motion, and ingenious are their reaſonings on the ſubject: but they are not ſatisfactory, nor do they at all explain the thing, and account for it. What is a muſcle?</p>
               <p>It is to be ſure a bundle of ſmall blood veſſels, conſiſting of arteries and their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veins, laid one upon another in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel plates, running thro' the whole length of the muſcle; and at ſmall intervals, theſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0028500100:196"/>blood veſſels, or longitudinal, red, and fleſhy fibres, are contorted and bound about with ſmall, tranſverſe, and ſpiral ramifications and twinings of the nerves. This is a muſcle: it has two ends, or tendons, faſtened to two bones, one of which is fixed, and the other moveable; and by the contraction of the muſcle, the moveable bone is drawn upon its <hi>fulcrum</hi> towards a fixed point. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable; and it is likewiſe certain, that the muſcles are to be diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of voluntary, and thoſe of natural or neceſſary motion: that the voluntary muſcles have antagoniſts, which act alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in a contrary direction, that is, are contracted by the command of the will, while the others are ſtretched, and again are extended, while the others are contracted: but the neceſſary muſcles have contracting and extending powers within themſelves, and need no antagoniſts.</p>
               <p>This being the true ſtate of the muſcles, the queſtion is, what cauſes that elaſticity, ſpring, or power of contraction and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which their nervous coats and fibres have, to recover themſelves againſt a given weight or force that ſtretches them? The reply is, that many unanſwerable reaſons can be given to prove, that this contractive reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive force does not depend on the mixture, efferveſcence, or rarefaction of any fluids,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0028500100:197"/>humours, or liquors within the body; and there is one convincing experiment that ſhews it.</p>
               <p>Lay open the thorax of a dog, (as I have often done) and take a diſtinct view of that famous muſcle, the heart, in its curious and wonderful motion, while the animal is ſtill alive. In <hi>diaſtole,</hi> the <hi>muſcle</hi> is <hi>very red</hi> and <hi>florid, ſoft</hi> and <hi>yielding</hi> to the touch, and thro' it the vital fluid glows and ſhines; it appears in this ſtate fully repleniſhed and diſtended with blood: but in <hi>ſyſtole,</hi> as ſoon as it begins to contract, and the blood ruſhes out by the compreſſion of the contracting fibres, the <hi>heart loſes its florid colour,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>livid, compact</hi> and <hi>ſolid,</hi> and evinces that, during this ſtate of it, the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle contracts inwardly into its own denſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and takes up leſs ſpace than before, till it returns to its <hi>diaſtole:</hi> then the blood which flowed from it with velocity, during <hi>ſyſtole</hi> thro' the <hi>coronary veins</hi> into the <hi>auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> ruſhes back into it thro' the <hi>coronary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,</hi> reſtores the glowing florid colour, and inflates the muſcle, in order to ſtrain the nerves for the next contraction. It is plain from hence, that the heart has leſs blood and fluid in time of <hi>contraction,</hi> and that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> is not cauſed by the addition of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fluid from the nerves, as the learned have aſſerted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0028500100:198"/>And as to what they ſay of the longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fibres being divided into innumerable lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cells or bladders, which have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with the blood veſſels and nerves, and that in theſe veſicles, the blood and nervous fluid mix, ferment, and by rarefaction and expanſion, ſwell and blow up the cells, and thereby inflate and diſtend the muſcle, and increaſe its thickneſs, while its length is ſhortned:—this is ſo perplexed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable an hypotheſis, that I am aſtoniſhed how men of ſenſe ever came to think of ſuch a doctrine. There is no ſuch nervous fluid to be found, to cauſe this fermentation, rarefaction, etc; and if there was, expanſive force muſt lengthen as well as thicken, and the muſcle could not be ſhortned in length, and ſwelled in thickneſs. The natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fluids upon the ſolids is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe dimenſions proportionably every way, that is, in the direction of the axis and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate diameter equally. Beſide, if there was <hi>expanſion, circulation</hi> muſt ſtop. The diſtention of the veſicles, and the rapid exit of the rarifying fluid could not be at once.</p>
               <p>The plain account of the matter is then, that <hi>muſcular motion is performed by the elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the nervous fibrillae, contracting and reſtoring themſelves againſt the ſtretching force of the circulating blood.</hi> The <hi>contraction</hi> of the muſcle ſtraitens and compreſſes the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0028500100:199"/>and forces the blood with impetuoſity thro' the heart; and this ſqueezing or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling force gives the fluid an impetus, that makes it return with violence upon the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, in the courſe of its circulation; then by force and impulſe, it ſtretches the tranſverſe and ſpiral nervous fibres, and ſo extends the contracted muſcle, that drove it by contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from itſelf. Upon this, the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels having obtained their due extent and capacity, the diſtending force of the blood of conſequence ceaſes: but the moment it does, the contractive power of the nerves begins to act again, and reſtores them to a contracted denſe ſtate, by a force exactly equal to that which extended them; till the returning propelled blood re-enters the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſtretches it again, as before deſcribed. Such are the two wonderful counter-forces that produce the natural involuntary motion of the heart, and carry on the circulation of the blood. You ſee with your eyes, in the opened live dog, this <hi>alternate contraction and extenſion;</hi> and as the <hi>ſtretching</hi> power is but a conſequence of the <hi>contracting</hi> power, <hi>contraction</hi> is the <hi>ſpring</hi> of this <hi>wonderful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which our will or free agency has no concern. And to what ſhall we aſcribe this aſtoniſhing operation, this amazing <hi>contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power,</hi> ſo exactly as to time, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly continued on the muſcles of natural
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0028500100:200"/>or neceſſary motion; till the <hi>aequilibrium</hi> by ſome means or other be broken, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is preternaturally interrupted and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended? Will the great mechanical reaſoners ſay, that <hi>matter</hi> does this wonder—matter, that is <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>impotent?</hi> Stuff: We muſt aſcribe to a <hi>cauſe wiſe and powerful,</hi> not only the <hi>original contrivance</hi> of the thing, but the <hi>execution</hi> of this extraordinary ſcene. While you gaze upon this nobleſt muſcle of the dog, you ſee the Deity at work.</p>
               <p>And if we turn our eyes from the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of mere natural involuntary motion, (which performs by a contracting power, acting within them), to thoſe muſcles which move the bones and members of our bodies, by the command of the will, how adorable is the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Almighty Author of nature, not only in providing the animal machine with <hi>antagoniſtical muſcles,</hi> one of which is contracted, while the other is extended; but for ſtimulating, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and compreſſing the nervous elaſtic cords and blood-veſſels, as our minds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or determine! there is no poſſibility of accounting for the directions at pleaſure of the antagoniſtic muſcles, but by reſolving them into the <hi>continual preſence</hi> and <hi>action</hi> of the firſt cauſe. He enforces and executes. It is the <hi>active principle</hi> gives <hi>energy</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> both to voluntary and neceſſary muſcles.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0028500100:201"/>This, I think, is the truth of philoſophy. To ſuppoſe every thing to be effect without cauſe, is to reduce religion and philoſophy to the ſame deſperate ſtate. It deſtroys all the principles of reaſon, as well as of virtue and moral conduct.</p>
               <p>To ſay all that can be ſaid, in as few words as poſſible, upon this article, it is not only the <hi>muſcular motion, neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous</hi>

               <p>The concluſion of the matter is, that the plain argument for the exiſtence of a Deity, obvious to all, and carrying irreſiſtible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction with it, is from the evident contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and fitneſs of things to one another, which we meet with through all the parts of the univerſe. There is no need of nice and ſubtile reaſoning in this matter: a manifeſt contrivance immediately ſuggeſts a contriver. It ſtrikes like a ſenſation, and artful reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt it may puzzle us, but it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhaking our belief. No perſon, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who knows the principles of opticks, and the ſtruture of the eye, can believe that it is formed without ſkill in that ſcience; or that the ear was formed without the knowledge of ſounds.—This is a juſt argument, and forces our aſſent. But the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0028500100:204"/>great <hi>Maclaurin</hi> ſhould not have ſtopped here. The plain argument for the exiſtence of a Deity grows ſtronger, when we add to it what is as evident as divine contrivance, to wit, the <hi>conſtant interpoſition of God,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and move his creatures. Original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance in the works of the creation is adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We are certain, demonſtratively cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the heavens, the land, and the waters, and all the creatures in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are the works of the living God: but it is the preſent performance that <hi>ſtrikes us like a ſenſation.</hi> With inexpreſſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we ſee creating power with our eyes. Which ever way we turn them, we behold Almighty Power employed, and continually acting under the direction of infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Since things are ſo, and all the works of nature, in the common voice of reaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the power and wiſdom of the Creator, and ſpeak his goodneſs in the innumerable mighty things he continually performs for our preſervation and happineſs, the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them ſhould warm our hearts with the Glory of the Almighty, and make us continually praiſe and adore that Almighty providence, which formed and ſuſtains not only the human race and this terreſtrial globe, but numberleſs other worlds and their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, that hang in infinite ſpace. Theſe

Such omnipotence in wiſdom and action, and ſuch amazing goodneſs as we ſee in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian goſpel, ſhould, I think, engage us to love and adore ſo great and good a Being as our Creator, and induce us to devote our lives to him.</p>
               <p>For my part, when I conſider the mighty ſcene and proſpect of nature, and turn my thoughts from thence to God's word, that heavenly law, which directs our will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms our reaſon, and teaches us in all things how to purſue our own happineſs, I am ſo ſtruck with a ſenſe of infinite wiſdom, goodneſs, and action, that I cannot help ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling the king of the univerſe for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power and mercy, and am neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily engaged in a ſcene of praiſe and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Indeed the heart muſt be as hard and cold as marble, that does not glow, nor is inflamed with raviſhing love to the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all things; after viewing with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even one particular only in the works of nature, that <hi>material ſun,</hi> which now ſhines out with light and beauty to animate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the world; and in the creation of grace, that <hi>ſun of righteouſneſs,</hi> who ſheds forth the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0028500100:206"/>choiceſt bleſſings of Heaven upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth. Can we be ſilent, who behold and enjoy thoſe things! alaſs! too many can. Neither the Heavens, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God, nor the days of the goſpel, nor the righteouſneſs of the new law, are regarded by them. But the wiſe will ever join with all their hearts, in the moſt exalted prayer and praiſe, and adore the Giver of theſe good and perfect gifts; for all his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings vouchſafed us; and eſpecially, for the charter of his pardon granted by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Son, and the promiſes of everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory in a life to come, reaſon muſt declare it juſt to offer up religious praiſe, and make the greateſt mental and moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement we can in this firſt ſtate.</p>

               <p> Another extraordinary thing I ſaw in the place I have mentioned, was a water on the top of a hill, which ſtood at the other end of the lake, and was full as high as the mountain, from the ſide of which, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poured into the lake. This loch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured three quarters of a mile in length, and half a mile over. The water appeared as black as ink, but in a glaſs it was clear as other water, and bright in running down. It taſted ſweet and good. At one end, it runs over its rocky bank, and in ſeveral noiſy caſcades, falls down the face of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a deep bottom, where a river is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0028500100:207"/>that is ſeen for a conſiderable way, as it wanders along. The whole is a ſtriking ſcene. The ſwarthy loch, the noiſy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſtreams, clumps of aged trees on the mountain's ſide, and the various ſhoars and vallies below, afford an uncommon view. It was a fine change of ground, to aſcend from the beautiful lake, (encompaſſed with mountains, and adorned with trees) into which was poured from a gaping preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, a torrent of ſtreams; and ſee from the reverſe of an oppoſite hill, an impetuous flood deſcending from the top to the fineſt points of view in the wildeſt glins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

               <head>36. Remarks on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</head>
               <p> Many books have been written in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this affair, and while ſome contend for the overflowing of the whole earth to a very great height of waters—and ſome for a partial deluge only—others will not allow there was any at all. The divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Moſes</hi> they diſregard. For my part, I believe the <hi>flood</hi> was <hi>univerſal,</hi> and that all the high hills and mountains under the whole heaven, were covered. The cauſe was forty days heavy rain, and ſuch an agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the abyſs, by the finger of God, as not only broke up the great deep, to pour out water at many places, but forced it out of ſuch bottomleſs lochs as this I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of on the mountains top, and from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>ſwallows</hi> in many places. This removes every objection from the caſe of the deluge, and gives water enough in the ſpace of 150 days, or five months of 30 days each, to over-top the higheſt mountains by 15 cubits, the height deſigned. The abyſs in ſtrong commotion, or violent uproar, by a power divine, could ſhake the incumbent globe to pieces in a few minutes, and bury the whole ruins in the deep. To me, then, all the reaſoning againſt the deluge, or for a partial flood, appear ſad ſtuff. Were this one loch in Stanemore to pour out torrents of water, down every ſide, for five months, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine force on part of the abyſs, as it might very eaſily by ſuch means do, the inundation
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0028500100:209"/>would cover a great part of this land; and if from every loch of the kind on the ſummits of mountains, the waters in like manner, with the greateſt violence, flowed from every ſide out of the abyſs, and that excluſive of the heavy rains, an earthquake ſhould open ſome parts of the ground to let more water out of the great collection, and the ſeas and oceans ſurpaſs their natural bounds, by the winds forcing them over the earth, then would a univerſal flood very ſoon prevail. There is water enough for the purpoſe, and as to the <hi>ſupernatural aſcent of them, natural</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural</hi> are nothing at all different with reſpect to God. They are diſtinctions merely in our conceptions of things. Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to move the ſun or earth; and to ſtop its motion for a day;—to make the waters that covered the whole earth at the creation, deſcend into the ſeveral receptacles prepared for them; and at the deluge, to make them aſcend again to cover the whole earth, are the effect of one and the ſame Almighty Power; tho' we call one <hi>natural,</hi> and the other <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> The one is the effect of no greater power than the other. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God, one is not more or leſs natural or ſupernatural than the other.</p>

                  <label>The means which drained off the waters of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge from the earth.</label> But how the waters of the deluge were drawn off at the end of the five months, is another queſtion among the learned. The
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0028500100:210"/>ingenious <hi>Keile,</hi> who writ againſt the two ingenious <hi>Theoriſts,</hi> ſays the thing is not at all accountable in any natural way: the drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and drying of the earth, of ſuch a huge column of waters could only be effected by the power of God: natural cauſes both in <hi>decreaſe</hi> and the <hi>increaſe</hi> of the waters muſt have been vaſtly diſproportionate to the effects; and to <hi>miracles</hi> they muſt be aſcribed. —This, I think, is as far from the truth, as the <hi>Theoriſts</hi> aſcribing both <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> to <hi>natural cauſes.</hi> God was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former to be ſure in the <hi>flood</hi> and the <hi>going off,</hi> but he made uſe of natural cauſes in both, that is, of the things he had in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning created. The natural cauſes he is the author of were at hand, and with them he could do the work. The ſun evaporated; the winds dried; and the waters no longer forced upwards from the abyſs, ſubſided into the many <hi>ſwallows</hi> or <hi>ſwallow-holes,</hi> that are ſtill to be ſeen in many places, on mountains and in vallies; thoſe on the mountains being neceſſary to abſorb that vaſt column of waters which roſe 15 cubits above the higheſt hills.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſwallow</hi> is ſuch another opening in the ground as <hi>Eldine Hole</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire</hi>

, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0028500100:211"/>in travelling from the <hi>Peak</hi> to the northern extremity of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> I have ſeen many ſuch holes in the earth, both on the hills and in the vales. I have likewiſe met with them in other countries. By theſe <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> a vaſt quantity of the waters to be ſure went down to the great receptacle; all that was not exhaled, or licked up by the winds; or, except what might be left to encreaſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeas of the antediluvian world into thoſe vaſt oceans which now encompaſſes the globe, and partly to form thoſe vaſt lakes that are in ſeveral parts of the World. Theſe things eaſily account for the removal of that vaſt maſs of waters which covered the earth, and was in a mighty column above the higheſt hills. Every difficulty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears before <hi>evaporation,</hi> the <hi>drying winds,</hi> the <hi>ſwallows,</hi> and perhaps, the <hi>turning ſeas into oceans:</hi> but the three firſt things now
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0028500100:212"/>named were ſufficient, and the gentlemen who have reaſoned ſo ingeniouſly againſt one another about the removal of the waters, might have ſaved themſelves a deal of trouble, if they had reduced the operation to three ſimple things, under the direction of the <hi>Firſt Cauſe.</hi> The <hi>ſwallows</hi> eſpecially muſt do great work in the caſe, if we take into their number not only very many open gulphs or chaſms, the depth of which no line or ſound can reach; but likewiſe the <hi>communications</hi> of very many <hi>parts of the ſea,</hi> and of many great <hi>unfathomable lochs,</hi> with the <hi>abyſs.</hi> Theſe <hi>abſorbers</hi> could eaſily receive what had before come out of them. The ſun by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, with the wind, might take away what was raiſed. There is nothing hard then in conceiving how the waters of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge were brought away.</p>
               <p>But as to the lake I have mentioned, into which a rapid flood poured from the bowels of the mountain, what became of this water the reader may inquire? To be ſure, as it did not run off in any ſtreams, nor make the lake riſe in the leaſt degree, there muſt have been a communication in ſome parts of its bottom, between the water of it and the <hi>abyſs.</hi> As the loch on the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I have deſcribed had no <hi>feeders,</hi> yet emitted ſtreams, and therefore muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the <hi>abyſs;</hi> ſo this lake, with ſo powerful a <hi>feeder,</hi> not running over, or
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0028500100:213"/>emitting water any way, muſt diſcharge it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the abyſs below. The caſe of it muſt be the ſame as that of the <hi>Caſpian ſea.</hi> Into this ſea many rivers pour, and one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the <hi>Volga</hi> I mean, that is more than ſufficient, in the quantity of water it turns out in a year, to drown the whole world. Yet the <hi>Caſpian</hi> remains in one ſtate, and does not overflow its banks, excepting, as before obſerved, ſometimes, in the ſpace of 16 years. It muſt by paſſages communicate with the great deep. It refunds the rivers into the great <hi>abyſs.</hi> The caſe of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean ſea</hi> is the ſame; for, tho' a ſtrong current from the <hi>Atlantic</hi> continually ſits through the <hi>Strait</hi> of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> yet theſe waters do not make it overflow the country round it, and of conſequence, they muſt be carried off by a ſubterranean paſſage, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, to the <hi>abyſs.</hi>

               <p>From the lake I proceeded the next morning, <hi>June</hi> 14, 1725, toward the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt end of <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> having paſſed the night in a ſound ſleep under the trees by the water ſide, but was forced by the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, to ſhape my courſe from four in the morning till eight, to the north-weſt, and then the road turned eaſt-north-eaſt, till I came to a great glin, where a river made a rumbling noiſe over rocks and inequalities of many kinds, and formed a very wild wonderful ſcene. The river
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0028500100:214"/>was broad and deep, and on an eaſy deſcent to it, was an aſſemblage of ſtones, that ran in length about 100 feet, in breadth 30 feet, and ſomewhat reſembling the <hi>giant's cauſeway,</hi> in the county of Antrim, and province of Ulſter in Ireland; nine miles north eaſt from the pretty town of <hi>Colerain.</hi> The <hi>giants cauſeway,</hi> reader, is a prodigious pile of rocks, 80 feet broad, 20 feet above the reſt of the ſtrand, and that run from the bottom of a high hill above 200 yards into the ocean.</p>
               <p>The aſſemblage of ſtones I am ſpeaking of are columns with ſeveral corners, that riſe three yards above the ground, and are joined as if done by art; the points being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex and concave, and thereby lying one in another. Theſe columns have five and ſix ſides, a few of them ſeven; and a number of them nicely and exactly placed together make one large pillar from one foot to two in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. They are ſo nicely joined, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they have five and ſix ſides, as I before ſaid, yet their contexture is ſo adapted, as to leave no vacuity between them; the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent angles of one pillar fitting, and falling exactly into the hollows left them between two others, and the plain ſides exactly anſwer to one another; ſo that thoſe hexagons and pentagons of columnar marble appear as if finiſhed by the hands of the moſt maſterly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0028500100:215"/>workmen. All the pillars ſtood exactly perpendicular to the plane of the horizon.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Foley,</hi> in the philoſophical tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 212, ſpeaking of the giants cauſeway, ſeems to think theſe wonderful pillars are compoſed of the common ſort of craggy rock by the ſea ſide: and the authors of the complete ſyſtem of geography are of opinion, they reſemble the <hi>lapis Baſaltes;</hi> but ſome think they are a ſort of marble. Now the truth is, the <hi>Baſaltes</hi> of the antients is a very elegant and beautiful marble of a fine deep gloſſy black, like high poliſhed ſteel, and is always found erect in the form of regular angular columns, compoſed of a number of joints, fitted together, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pillars: ſo that where ſuch pillars are ſeen, they are undoubtedly the <hi>columnar marble</hi> or <hi>touchſtone</hi> of the antients. Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of foſſils, gives a good account of the nature of this body, and mentions ſeveral places it is to be found in; but ſeems not to have heard there was any of it among the northern mountains of our country.</p>
               <p>This marble is one of the nobleſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature, and of all the foſſil kingdom, the moſt aſtoniſhing body. If art is requiſite for the formation of many things we ſee daily done with elegance and beauty; then certainly, mind itſelf, even the ſupreme mind, muſt have cauſed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0028500100:216"/>ſuch effects as theſe aſtoniſhing marble pillars; which lie in vaſt compound perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular columns at great depths in the earth, (none in beds of ſtrata, like the other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles), and riſe in ſuch beautiful joints and angles, well fitted together more than ſix and thirty foot above ground in ſome places. No other way could thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful productions have come into being, but by that <hi>intelligent, active power,</hi> who <hi>ſpeaks intelligibly to every nation by his works.</hi> To talk as ſome people do, that <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which deſtroys the very idea of intelligent and deſigning activity — or <hi>chance,</hi> which is an utter abſurdity — or the <hi>ſea,</hi> according to <hi>Telliamed,</hi> generated and formed this genus of marble, and ſo wonderfully diſtinguiſhed it from all the other marmora; by making it into pentagon, hexagon, and ſeptagon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, and rendering the points of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns convex and concave, and ſo amazingly joining them together, that the prominent angles of one pillar fall exactly into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low left beween two others, and the plain ſides exactly anſwer to one another, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, while all of them ſtand up perpendicular, contrary to the quality of all other marbles, and ſome lie in beds of ſtrata — To talk I ſay of the <hi>ſea,</hi> a <hi>chance,</hi> a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> doing this, or any thing of ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a kind, is to produce ſchemes founded in ignorance, and everſive of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

               <p> Another extraordinary thing I ſaw in a valley not far from that where the <hi>Baſalts</hi> ſtands. It is a boiſterous burning ſpring. It riſes with great noiſe and vibration, and guſhes out with a force ſufficient to turn many mills. The water is clear and cold, but to the taſte unpleaſant, being ſomething like a bad egg. I judged from the nature of its motion, that the water would take fire, and having lit my torch, ſoon put it in a flame. The fire was fierce, and the water ran down the vale in a blaze. It was a river of fire for a conſiderable way, till it ſunk under ground among ſome rocks, and thereby diſappeared. After it had burnt ſome time, I took ſome boughs from a tree, and tying them together, beat the ſurface of the well for a few minutes, and the burning ceaſed. The water was not hot, as one might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but cold as the coldeſt ſpring could be. There are a great number of ſuch ſprings in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0028500100:218"/>the world, but this is the largeſt I have read of, or ſeen. It differs from that of <hi>Broſeley</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> within ſix miles of <hi>Bridge-north,</hi> in this reſpect, that <hi>Broſeley</hi> well will not continue to burn for any time, unleſs the air be kept from it; to which purpoſe they have encloſed it in an iron ciſtern with a cover to it; and to experiment the boiling a piece of meat by the fire of this ſpring, they clap the pot cloſe down when they cover is taken up, and then it burns as long as they will; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the largeſt joint of meat fit to eat in half the time the ſtrongeſt culinary fire could do the work. As to the medicinal virtues of the ſpring, in the mountains, I can only ſay, that as it has a copious ſulphur, and from thence flames like ſpirit of wine, it is probable it might be as effectual in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating ſanity in various caſes, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous burning ſpring is in the palatinate of of <hi>Cracow</hi> of the leſſer <hi>Poland,</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Leipſic acts,</hi> An. 1684. p. 326. And as to the extinguiſhing this fire by beating it with twigs, it muſt to be ſure be for the reaſon given by Mr. <hi>Denis,</hi> that as the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mability of ſuch ſprings is to be aſcribed to ſulphur, and to its exhalations burſting out of the water; ſo this floating flame, which is too ſubtle to heat the water, is ſtifled, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving theſe ſpirits in the aqueous particles, by bruſhing the ſurface with brooms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conradus</hi> tells us, concerning the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0028500100:219"/>ſpring, that at one time, when it was kindled by lightning, the people neglected to put it out, and the ſtream proceeded on fire for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt three years, and reduced all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring wood to aſhes. It is really a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſight to ſee ſuch a river of fire, and adorable muſt be that power, who has cauſed ſuch things. To ſay that matter and motion circumſcribe and regulate ſuch powers, is idle to the laſt degree. It is an inverſion of reaſon. The very exiſtence of the water and ſulphur of this ſpring, muſt be by the power of the Creator conſtantly put forth upon it, which cauſes the parts to be what we call ſuch things; and the motion of both muſt be an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;</hi> for motion is not eſſential to matter. Nothing elſe could produce them, and a cauſe there muſt be equal to the various and wonderful effects of both, a cauſe that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, wiſe, and powerful. The Deity is every where preſent, and every where active. His power is indeſinently working, gives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence to the various creatures, and produces the moſt noble phaenomena in nature. All we ſee, all we feel, fire and water, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal variety of inanimate and animate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are only the effects of his creating power conſtantly repeated. The exiſtence of the whole world is a continual new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore it becomes the bounden duty of all rational creatures, to worſhip this Almighty Power, as well for his works of

               <p> From the burning fountain we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded for half an hour in the ſame valley right onwards, and then turned to the left in a courſe to the weſt, for about a mile, which brought us to the bottom of a ſteep moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we muſt aſcend, or go no farther. It was hard to get the horſes over this, and no leſs difficult to deſcend with them to a deep bottom on the other ſide of the hill: but with great hazard to ourſelves and the beaſts, we came down in ſafety. On the top of this mountain I ſaw another large <hi>loch</hi> that was black as ink in appearance, tho' bright when taken up in a glaſs; which, (as before obſerved) muſt be owing I ſuppoſe to its top communicating with the <hi>abyſs</hi> below; and in the bottom we deſcended to, there was a <hi>ſwallow</hi> larger than the one I ſaw before. I could make no diſcovery as to its depth, either by line or ſound; nor did my lead touch any water. On the ſloping way from the firſt chaſm in day to the gulph, were ſeveral lateral chambers, that deſcended one yard in ſix; but tho' the bottom was hard, the horrors of the places hindered me from going far. I went to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0028500100:221"/>end of the firſt, which was 67 yards, and having looked into the ſecond, to which a narrow ſhort paſs leads the inquirer, I made what haſte I could back; for the opening diſcovers a ſpace ſo vaſt, diſmal, and frightful, that it ſtrikes one to the heart. The bottom, as far as my light could enable me to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, was a continuance of ſtone; but neither top nor ſides were to be ſeen. It is a horrible place.</p>

               <p> Leaving this bottom, we mounted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very high and dangerous hill, and from the top of it deſcended into twenty acres of as rich and beautiful ground as my eyes had ever ſeen. It was covered with flowers and aromatic herbs; and had, in the center of it, a little grove of beautiful trees; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were fruits of ſeveral kinds. A flowing ſpring of the pureſt water was in the middle of this ſweet little wood, and ran in pretty windings over the ground. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and adorned the field, and it was beautiful to ſee the deer from the hills, and the goats come down from the cliffs, to drink at theſe ſtreams. The whole was ſurrounded with precipices that aſcended above the clouds, and through one of theſe rocky mountains there was an opening that had a ſtupendous appearance.</p>
               <p>It was a vaſt amazing arch, that had ſome reſemblance of the gothic iſle of a large cathedral church, and terminated in a view
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0028500100:222"/>of rocks hanging over rocks in a manner frightful to behold. It meaſured an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards in length, 40 in breadth, and I judged it to be fifty yards high. The pending rocks in view incloſed a ſpace of four acres, as it appeared to me, and the bottom was ſo very deep that it looked like night below. What line I had could not reach it, nor could I make any thing of the depth by ſound. It ſeemed to me to be a vaſt <hi>ſwallow</hi> that went down to the <hi>abyſs.</hi> The whole was a ſcene that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the ſoul with horror.</p>

               <p> By the ſpring in the little grove I have mentioned, I ſat down at 8 in the morning, to breakfaſt on ſomething that one of my ſquires produced from his ſtore, while the other was looking for a paſſage or way on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, between thoſe vaſt precipices that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded us. Two hours he waſted in an enquiry, and then returned, to let me know there was no paſſage that he could find: the encloſed rocks were one continued chain of unpaſſable mountains. Here then I thought was my ne plus ultra. As the man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed there was no getting beyond the vaſt incloſing cliffs that walled in this charming ſpot of earth, I imagined for ſome time, that I muſt of neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and give over all thoughts of getting to the borders of <hi>Cumberland</hi> or <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> that way. It ſeemed impoſſible to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0028500100:223"/>proceed, and that was no ſmall trouble to my mind. It was a great journey round, and if I did ride it, I knew not where to turn in on the confines of the country my friend lived on; for I had loſt his directions, and had only a ſmall remembrance of his dwelling ſomewhere on the north edge of Weſtmoreland or Yorkſhire, or on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining borders of Cumberland, or the county of Durham. What to do I could not for ſome time tell: going back I did not at all like, and therefore, to avoid it if poſſible, reſolved to paſs the day in trying if I could find any way out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out climbing the mountain again that I had lately come down. Round then I walked, once, and to no manner of purpoſe, for I did not ſee any kind of paſs; but the ſecond time, as I marched on obſerving the hill, I took notice of a large clump of great trees in an angle or deep corner, that ſeemed to ſtand very oddly, and in the mountain above them there appeared as I thought a diſtance or ſpace that looked like an opening. I ſoon found it was ſo, and that at the back of this little wood, there lay a very narrow way, only broad enough for two horſes a-breaſt: that it extended due weſt for more than a mile, and then weſt-north-weſt for a quarter of a mile, till it terminated in a plain that was ſeveral miles in circumference, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſurrounded with hills.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0028500100:224"/>in walking the paſs by myſelf, <note place="margin">1725.</note> and then returned to bring the horſes and men, through this amazing way. It was quite dark, mere night all along; and the bottom very bad. It was likewiſe every dangerous. It was evident from the ground, that ſtones had fallen from the tops of the hills; and ſhould any deſcend from ſo vaſt a height on us, tho' even ſmall ones, they would without all peradventure be immediate death.</p>

               <p> The plain we came into from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, was above a mile over to the oppoſite hills, and a-croſs it was a walk of aged oaks, that ſeemed, in ſuch a place, as the avenue that leads to the <hi>fairy caſtle of wiſhes.</hi> If ſuch beings there are, as Dr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> hath in one of his books af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, then here, I ſaid, in this fine ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic region, where all the charms of the field, the foreſt, the water, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, are united, may be their favorite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and perhaps they will admit me into their <hi>fairy caſtle:</hi> then commences their friendſhip, and when they have all breathed on me, it is but wiſhing for the future, and the completion of every deſire is granted the moment it is formed. Would not this be compleat happineſs? what do you ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion?</p>
               <p>No, (reflexion anſwered, as we rid up this avenue.) Imagination may form fine pictures
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0028500100:225"/>of felicity from an indulgence in every wiſh; but, ſo blind are mankind to their own real happineſs, that it is oftner to the gratification than to the diſappointment of their wiſhes that all their miſery is owing. We often chooſe what is not conſonant to the welfare of our nature, and ſtrive to avoid thoſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which are fated in the order of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable events for our good. Frequently do we labour to ſecure the things that debaſe us into ſlaves, and overwhelm us with cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but ſeldom do we deſire, rarely do we ſtrive to obtain thoſe objects, and acquire that ſtation, which are moſt likely to render humanity as perfect as it can be in this world, rational and godlike, and thereby crown our lives with true happineſs. Many a man has purſued a Venus, an eſtate, an honour, with much toil and wonderful activity, and when poſſeſſed of the fancyed bleſſing, have been made very miſerable mortals. The wiſhed for beauty has often made even the huſband wretched. An aching ſcar is often covered with the laurel: and in reſpect of envied great fortunes, gaudy is the thing without, and within very often is mere bitterneſs. The wiſdom is, as to this world, not to get from the fairies a power of enjoying all that fancy may deſire, if that was poſſible; but, to act well and wiſely, in the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, lovely, and fair manner, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

.</p>
               <p>But if another life is taken into the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the argument grows ſtronger againſt a power of enjoying all we could wiſh for.— As we are accountable creatures, and are pouring faſt out of time into eternity, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion undoubtedly ought to be the main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mortals;—that religion, which is a living principle, ſpring, or root of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

It would be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an advantage to mankind, if they could wiſh and have vaſt fortunes, all the pleaſures, the pomps and honours of the world, that they would thereby be deprived of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional joys of life, and be influenced to think no more of the excellency and beauty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the good conſequences of ſerving God truly.

This is enough to make us as happy here as reaſon can deſire. We have a ſufficiency to go through this world to that other where we are to be ſtationed for ever, and againſt the accidents of the way, we have the ſupports which innocence and virtue to the good adminiſter. Peace and tranquillity of mind here, and hopes full of comfort with reſpect to hereafter, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of our happineſs; a happineſs the greateſt! and we are certain that he, upon whoſe mercy and goodneſs we confeſs we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, will, in regard to our <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>truſt,</hi> our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> when this fleeting ſcene is over, make us glorious and ever bleſſed in the kingdom he has prepared for thoſe that rely on the Divine Goodneſs, and do their beſt to advance the ſtate of true vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the world.

               <p>Thus did <hi>reflexion</hi> entertain me, as I rid up this grand ſhady walk, which looked like the avenue I had read of in the <hi>Tales</hi> of the <hi>Fairies,</hi> and brought me to a <hi>natural grotto,</hi> more beautiful than <hi>Aelian</hi>'s deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Atalanta's,</hi> or that in <hi>Homer,</hi> where <hi>Calypſos</hi> lived. — It was a large cavern at the bottom of a marble mountain, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, was covered round with ivy, that clung about ſome aged oaks, (on either ſide the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance) that ſeemed coeval with the earth on which they grew. Abundance of large lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel trees, in clumps, adorned an extenſive area before the door; and ſaffron, and hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths, and flowers of many colours, covered in confuſed ſpots the carpet green. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ground refreſhed the ſight, and purified the air: and to enhance the beauties of the ſpot, a clear and cold ſtream guſhed from a neighbouring rock; which watered the trees and plants, and ſeemed to combat with the earth, whether of them moſt contributed to their growth and preſervation. It was a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0028500100:230"/>ſweet rural ſcene. For charms and ſolitude the place was equally to be admired.</p>
               <p>The inſide of this <hi>grotto</hi> was a beautiful green marble, extremely bright, and even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the appearance of the emerald. It was thick ſet with ſhells, and thoſe not ſmall ones, but ſome of the largeſt and fineſt kinds: many of them ſeemed, as it were, ſqueezed together by the marble, ſo as to ſhew the edges only; but more were to be ſeen at large, and filled with the pureſt ſpar. The whole had a fine effect, and as the cave had been divided by art into ſix fine apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had doors and chimnies moſt ingeniouſly contrived, both the manſion and its ſituation charmed me in a high degree. It was a beautiful habitation indeed. On ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of it were many cottages, pretty and clean, and as ſheep were feeding on the field, ſome cows grazing, and various kinds of tame fowl before the doors, I concluded it was an inhabited place, before I ſaw any one.</p>

               <p> The firſt human being I beheld, was an old woman, who appeared at the grotto door, and I requeſted her to inform me, who lived in this delightful place;—and which was my beſt way to Cumberland or Biſhoprick? Sir, (replied the good old woman) you are welcome to <hi>Burcott-Lodge.</hi> Women only are the inhabitants of this ſpot: and over the

                  <head>The picture of Azora.</head>
                  <p>She was attended by ten young women, ſtraight, clean, handſome girls, and ſurpaſſed them in tallneſs. Her countenance was maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, but not auſtere: her fine blue eyes diſcovered an excellence of temper, while they ſhewed the penetration of her mind. Her hair was brown, bright and charming; and nature had ſtamped upon her cheeks a colour, that exceeded the moſt beautiful red of the fineſt flower. It was continually as the maiden bluſh of a modeſt innocence. She was dreſt in a fine woollen ſtuff, made in the manner ſhepherdeſſes are painted, and on her head had a band or fillet like what the ladies now wear, with a bunch of artificial flowers in her hair. She had a very ſmall ſtraw hat on.—In her hand, ſhe held a long and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0028500100:232"/>pretty crook: and as her coats were ſhort, her feet were ſeen, in black ſilk ſhoes, and the fineſt white ſtockings, and appeared vaſtly pretty. She ſtruck me greatly. She was a charming, and uncommon figure. When I came up to <hi>Azora,</hi> I could hardly forbear addreſſing her, as the ſon of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> did the ſupernal,—O vous, qui que vous ſoiez, mortelle ou deeſſe (quoiqu'a vous voir on ne puiſſe vous prendre que pour une divinité) ſeriez-vóus inſenſible au malheur d'un fils, qui —Whoever you are, a mortal or a goddeſs, tho' ſure your aſpect ſpeaks you all divine, can you, unmoved, behold a hapleſs ſon, by fate expelled, and urged by unrelenting rage, to wander thro' the world, expoſed to winds and ſeas, and all the ſtrokes of adverſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, till he arrived in this land of felicity and peace?—But on better thoughts, I only ſaid, I am your moſt humble ſervant, madam, and told her I believed I had loſt my way, and knew not where to go;—To which ſhe replied, you are welcome, ſir, to our <hi>hamlet,</hi> and to the beſt entertainment it affords: only tell me, ſhe added with a ſmile, what could induce you to travel this unbeaten road—and how did you paſs the precipices and rivers you muſt have met with in the way?—Curioſity, madam, (I anſwered) was one cauſe; that I might ſee a country
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0028500100:233"/>no traveller had been in; and my next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, to find a valuable friend; who lives ſomewhere upon the northern border of this county, or Yorkſhire, or on the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limits of Cumberland or Durham; but on which I know not; and as I came from <hi>Brugh under Stanemore,</hi> I judged it the ſhorteſt way by a great many miles, and the likelieſt to ſucceed in my enquiry after my friend:—then as to hills and waters, many dangerous ones I have gone over, and with great toil and fatigue have got thus far.—This <hi>(Azora</hi> ſaid) is a rational account of your journey, and as there are many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtill before you, you are welcome to reſt with us till you are refreſhed, and able to proceed.</p>
                  <p>By this time, we reached the grotto door, and upon entring the firſt apartment, I ſaw another lady, dreſt in the ſame manner, and ſeemed to be of the ſame age, that is, about ſix and twenty, as I was told. This was <hi>Azora</hi>'s companion and friend. She was a very pretty woman, tho' inferior to <hi>Azora</hi> in charms: but her mind was equally luminous and good. Neither ſhe nor <hi>Azora</hi> were learned women, that is, they underſtood no other language than the Engliſh tongue, and in that they had but a ſmall collection of the beſt books; but thoſe few they had read
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0028500100:234"/>well, and they had capacities to think. In reaſon, philoſophy, and mathematicks, they were excellent, and in the moſt agreeable manner, diſcovered in converſation the fineſt conceptions of the moſt excellent things. <hi>Azora,</hi> of the two, was by much the beſt ſpeaker. Her voice was delightful, and her pronunciation juſt; ſtrong, clear, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. With unſpeakable pleaſure did I liſten to her, during three days that I happily paſſed with her and her companion, and received from both many valuable informations. I thought I underſtood algebra very well, but I was their inferior, and they inſtructed me; and on the fundamental points of religion, they not only out-talked me, but out-reaſoned me. It is very ſtrange, I confeſs. It is very true, however.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Azora,</hi> in particular, had an amazing col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the moſt rational philoſophical ideas, and ſhe delivered them in the moſt pleaſing dreſs, with as much eaſe as ſhe breathed. She aſked me, after I had feaſted on an excellent ſupper, how religion went on in the world; and what was the condition of that which came from ſupernatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as ſhe phraſed it? and when I told her, that our excellent divines did all that was poſſible for men to do, to turn the world from <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of every kind to that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0028500100:235"/>
                     <hi>expreſs revelation</hi> which reſtores the dictates of <hi>uncorrupted reaſon</hi> to their <hi>force</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> which teaches the knowledge of <hi>one ſupreme Spirit</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> and the nature of that <hi>worſhip</hi> which is due to a Being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to, or dependent upon particular places, or circumſtances; but always and every where preſent with us: ſhe anſwered, that ſuch clergymen are glorious, and cannot be enough admired; and great is the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the men who oppoſed them, and forced them into the field of diſputation, from their holy labour of inſtructing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in penitential piety and ſanctification: I mean the <hi>infidels</hi> and the <hi>bigots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can be more unjuſt and impious, <hi>(Azora</hi> continued) than for men to declame againſt a revelation which diſplays the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal regard of God for his creatures, by doing more than was ſtrictly neceſſary for their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as they had his <hi>original law</hi> of <hi>reaſon</hi> before he gave them the <hi>goſpel;</hi> and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to extend our knowledge even as to thoſe things which we are by nature capable of knowing; which awakens us to duty, and adviſes us how to walk in the ways of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſafety. To reject ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary method of ſaving us, is ſenſeleſs and culpable indeed. Surely, when <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> has led mankind into <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> we ought to adore the divine goodneſs

We can never be thankful enough for a <hi>revelation,</hi> that has a tendency to promote the happineſs of mankind both here and hereafter. The oppoſition, in my opinion, is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; as the external evidence of hiſtory, miracles, and prophecy for the goſpel, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtably ſtrong, when fairly examined; muſt appear with force to a modeſt, candid, impartial inquirer; and as the internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the ſacred letters, their uſefulneſs and excellence, muſt be obvious to every attentive capacity, that delights in the purſuit of religion and virtue. Truth and candor, then, thoſe infidels are ſtrangers to. They are not fair reaſoners. They are haughty, over-bearing declaimers.</p>

                  <p>If men will think, they muſt perceive (without the reaſon of a <hi>Newton</hi> or <hi>Clarke</hi>) the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of a <hi>ſpiritual influence</hi> in all the

An influencing Being, endued with the faculties of perception, activity, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, is plane. The <hi>accidental qualities</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> called <hi>attraction, repulſion,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of motion,</hi> evince that <hi>material and vegetable nature,</hi> and <hi>all the parts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated matter,</hi> are <hi>actuated</hi> by <hi>one ſupreme</hi> and <hi>univerſal ſpirit:</hi> I ſay <hi>One Spirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is evident from a <hi>ſameneſs</hi> of <hi>volition,</hi> that is, from <hi>one and the ſame faculty of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,</hi> manifeſt throughout all nature, that there are not ſeveral diſtinct, independent ſpirits. In <hi>attraction, repulſion,</hi> and <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of motion,</hi> there appears no different faculty of volition, but a <hi>different exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>ſame faculty</hi> of <hi>volition;</hi> which, for wiſe reaſons, makes ſome parts of matter cohere ſtrongly, as ſtone and metal,—ſome weakly, as earth, etc; ſome repel, while others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; ſome elaſtic, and others non-elaſtic.

                  <p>Thus common reaſon confeſſes that there is <hi>one infinite univerſal, ſupreme ſpirit,</hi> who <hi>actuates</hi> and <hi>governs</hi> the univerſe; and from the heavens, the earth, and ourſelves, we are as certain that there is a <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of all the worlds, who <hi>directs</hi> every <hi>atom</hi> of it, and <hi>animates</hi> every <hi>material form,</hi> as we are of any thing demonſtrated to us. And as he is not only the Creator but the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Preſerver of every being, there can be no power equal to him. He muſt be omnipotent. He muſt likewiſe be eternal and omnipreſent; for there was no ſuperior power to receive exiſtence from, nor is there a ſuperior power to confine it. As to his infinite intelligence, his being the Author
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0028500100:241"/>and Preſerver of all things demonſtrates it.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the <hi>human ſoul (Azora</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) it is impoſſible for <hi>perception</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>body,</hi> or from any <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>modification</hi> of parts of the body; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there muſt be a mind in which our ideas muſt be produced and exiſt. If the <hi>ideas</hi> of <hi>ſenſation</hi> may be ſuppoſed to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the different motions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent parts of the brain, yet they cannot be thoſe motions. The motions can only enable a ſpiritual percipient to note them, remember them, etc: and as to <hi>reflection,</hi> the other part of the perceptive faculty, <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> and <hi>contemplation,</hi> it is not poſſible they can proceed from the different motions into which the parts of the brain are put; becauſe they are employed ſolely about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which were only in the mind. The caſe is the ſame as to many other qualities or faculties;— in the deſigning quality, the inventing quality, the judging quality, the reaſoning quality, the compounding quality, the abſtracting quality, the diſcerning quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the recollective quality, the retentive quality, the freedom of will, the faculty of volition, and eſpecially the foreſeeing faculty: theſe cannot be the faculties of matter. Such qualities muſt exiſt ultimately and ſolely in mind. Can foreſight, for example, be the work of matter, when it is employed about

No ſurely. It muſt be the ſpiritual part of the compound that acts upon the occaſion: in all the <hi>intelligent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> which we comprehend under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex idea of <hi>underſtanding, ſpirit</hi> only can be the <hi>performer.</hi>

                  <p>As to our being accountable hereafter for the deeds we have done in this firſt ſtate of exiſtence,  this can admit of no ſpeculation; for as we have received from our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the <hi>eternal law of reaſon,</hi> which enables us to diſtinguiſh right and wrong, and to govern the inferior powers and paſſions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and ſenſes, if we pleaſe; — as we are endued with an underſtanding which can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire large moral dominion, and may, if we oppoſe not, ſit as queen upon the throne over the whole corporeal ſyſtem; ſince the noble faculty of reaſon was given to rectify the ſoul, and purify it from earthly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to elevate it above the objects of ſenſe, to purge it from pride and vanity, ſelfiſhneſs and hypocriſy, and render it juſt, pious and good; — of conſequence, God has a right to call us to account for our conduct in this firſt ſtate, and will reward or puniſh, in a moſt extraordinary manner; as the principles and actions of man have been righteous; or, his life and character ſtained by unjuſt diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and filthy deeds. This is plain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon. Every underſtanding muſt ſee this, how wrong ſoever they wilfully act. As God by his nature muſt abhor iniquity, and love what is honeſt, pure, and good; he muſt reward the piety and worthy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0028500100:244"/>of thoſe, who act <hi>according to reaſon</hi> in this life, and with views beyond the bounds of time, endeavour to proceed each day to more exalted ideas of virtue: but, the mortals who deviate from rectitude and goodneſs, and wilfully live workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, muſt expect that God, the Father of ſpirits, the Lover of truth, and the patron of righteouſneſs and virtue, will proportion future puniſhments to preſent vices, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them to the regions of eternal darkneſs. From the natural lights of our underſtanding we have the higheſt reaſon to conclude this will be the caſe. The truths are as evident to a reflection, as that this world, and we who inhabit it, could not have had eternal exiſtence, nor be firſt formed by any natural cauſe; but muſt have been originally produced, as we are now conſtantly preſerved, by the ſupreme and univerſal Spirit. This is the excellent law of reaſon or nature. There is a light ſufficient in every human breaſt, to conduct the ſoul to <hi>perfect day,</hi> if men will follow it right onwards, and not turn into the paths that lead to the <hi>dark night of hell.</hi>

                     <hi>Azora</hi>'s religious notions amazed me,  and the more, as they were uttered with a fluency and eaſe beyond any thing I had ever heard before. In the ſofteſt, ſweeteſt voice, ſhe expreſſed herſelf, and without the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of labour, her ideas ſeemed to flow
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0028500100:245"/>from a vaſt fountain. She was a maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the doctrine of ideas. Her notion of them and their formation was juſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and in a few minutes ſhe ſettled every thing relating to them. Her ideas of activity and paſſivity afforded me much inſtruction, as did her notions of ſpace, matter, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and what is ſtill more extraordinary, ſhe had a fine conception of an <hi>electrical fluid,</hi> which is thought to be a diſcovery made very lately, and made uſe of it to prove, not that it is the ultimate cauſe of effects, but that every thing is cauſed and directed by an <hi>immaterial ſpirit.</hi> An <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſpirit</hi> was her favorite article, and it was to me a fine entertainment to hear her on that ſubject; from the one ſupreme Spirit down to the ſpirit of brute animals. — But to conclude our converſation on religion; I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to <hi>Azora,</hi> that if things were ſo, and the law of reaſon was ſo perfect and ſufficient, then I could not ſee that there was any want at all of the <hi>religion of favor,</hi> ſince that of <hi>nature</hi> was enough to confirm us in rectitude and holineſs, if we would obey its directions; and to ſhew us the way to the <hi>manſions</hi> of <hi>angels.</hi> Why the <hi>law of grace</hi> at ſo great an expence — if the <hi>rule of reaſon</hi> can make us good here, and for ever happy hereafter?</p>

That we may do ſo, we have the promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to enable us to turn from ſin and <hi>Satan</hi> to the living God, that by the acting principle of ſanctification, wrought within us by the hand of him that made us, (without the leaſt force on our will,) we may <hi>perfect our ſouls in purity and holineſs, exerciſe acts of love and benevolence, and worſhip the one true God in and through the one true Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> —Reaſon alone, excellent as it is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce any thing like this.</p>

                  <p>All this (I anſwered) is juſt and fine,  and I have only to requeſt, for my farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that you will be pleaſed, madam, to explain yourſelf a little more on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of a <hi>ſin-offering</hi> and <hi>grace;</hi> for I have always thought there was a darkneſs ſat upon theſe parts of reveled religion, and have often wiſhed for what I have not yet found, a head capable of giving me intire ſatisfaction on thoſe points: but from what I have heard you ſay, I muſt now ſuppoſe that all my doubts, relative to the two ſubjects, you have the power to remove. — My power <hi>(A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zora</hi> returned) is no more than a plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that in this ſtill and peaceful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, has been at liberty to think, without being corrupted by ſophiſtry, ſchool-nonſenſe, or authority; and, as to giving ſatisfaction on the heads you mention, or any other, it is not what I pretend to: but my opinion you ſhall have ſince you aſk it; and in the following manner <hi>Azora</hi> proceeded.</p>

                  <head>Azora's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſin-offering.</head>
                  <p>As to our <hi>Lord</hi>'s becoming a <hi>ſin-offering,</hi> I conceive, in the firſt place, that God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0028500100:251"/>it, becauſe he ſaw it <hi>needful,</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to anſwer <hi>many and great ends.</hi> It muſt be right, and what in the reaſon and nature of things ought to be, though we were not able to comprehend the reaſons that made it needful. It muſt have been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt way to make up the breach between heaven and earth, ſince infinite wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, as the <hi>death of this great perſon</hi> not only gave the higheſt atteſtation to the truth of his doctrine, and confirmed every word he had preached; to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners to repent, and the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of ſaints; but has afforded us ſuch a noble <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>obedience,</hi> as muſt have an influence on intelligent beings, and excite them to <hi>practiſe obedience</hi> to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and perfect reſignation to his will in every caſe; which are ſome excellent reaſons for Chriſt's dying; ſo did Almighty God make this farther uſe of it, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> (which was ſhed to produce the <hi>eſſence of ſanctification</hi> in the ſoul, to wit, <hi>devotedneſs, truſt,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation</hi> to the Almighty Father of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; to be the <hi>blood of anew covenant, ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> This ſeems to me to take in the whole caſe. Chriſt by <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the death</hi> (which happened in the natural courſe of things) is held out to the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0028500100:252"/>world a <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>ſelf-ſacrifice</hi> in the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> — a <hi>ſample</hi> of that <hi>perfect religion — not my will, but thine be done:</hi> the glorious goſpel is thereby confirmed: and our <hi>redemption</hi> is effected by the <hi>blood of the Son of God.</hi> As <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Mediator</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> repeated to the people the laws and judgments of God, and received their conſent to the divine commands; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered this covenant in his book, offered ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of praiſe and friendſhip, and then confirmed the covenant in the moſt ſolemn manner, by dividing the blood of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices into parts; one part of which he <hi>ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the altar,</hi> to ratify God's part of the covenant: and with the other part <hi>ſprinkled the people,</hi> that is, the twelve princes, the heads, or the twelve pillars, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the twelve tribes, and then awfully cried out with a ſtrong voice — <hi>Behold the blood of the covenant Jehovah has made with you:</hi> ſo did the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> between God and all mankind, teach the people by his <hi>goſpel</hi> to <hi>rectify their notions,</hi> to <hi>regulate their affections,</hi> to <hi>direct their worſhip;</hi> with the judgments that were to be the conſequence of diſobedience, the rewards prepared for thoſe who obey; and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in relation to his death, <hi>This is my blood of the new covenant.</hi> The <hi>blood</hi> I muſt ſhed on the <hi>croſs</hi> will ſeal, ratify, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0028500100:253"/>a pardoning covenant, and by virtue thereof, upon repentance and converſion, the world <hi>is waſhed clean through the blood of the Lamb.</hi> This, I think for myſelf, renders the thing very plain and eaſy. The death of the Son of God was taken into the plan of redemption, <hi>not to pacify God's anger;</hi> for God could be no otherwiſe pleaſed or delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>blood of his Son,</hi> than as his ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was an act of the higheſt obedience, and a noble pattern to all the rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but <hi>his blood</hi> was made the <hi>ſeal</hi> of a <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>juſtifying covenant;</hi> and by the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> (the moſt powerful means to prevent ſin, and to draw ſinners to obey the commands of heaven,) God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated his love and mercy to mankind. I fancy I am clear. In this view of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I can ſee no difficulty in being juſtified <hi>freely by the grace of God, thro' the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> God is the ſole original and fountain of redemption. The <hi>Son,</hi> and his <hi>goſpel</hi> are the great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Lo! I come to do thy will, O my God,</hi> the Son declares: and the <hi>Blood</hi> he <hi>ſhed,</hi> the better to bring the human race to wiſdom, rectitude and happineſs, is appointed by our merciful, good, and gracious Father, to be the ſeal and ratifcation of a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>Moloch</hi> might want a cruel and bloody ſacrifice to pacify him; but the <hi>Father</hi> of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0028500100:254"/>the univerſe ſent his <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>deliver</hi> his <hi>commands,</hi> and made the death, which he foreſaw would happen by his Son's delivering ſuch commands to impious men, to be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and the <hi>people,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould be conſidered as <hi>a propitiation for our ſins,</hi> and his <hi>death</hi> be an <hi>eternal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> of the Almighty's love, and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of iniquity. There can no objection lie againſt this. To me this appears the moſt rational and beautiful ſcheme that infinite wiſdom could contrive. Moſt glorious and good is our God. Moſt happy may mortals be, if they pleaſe. The virtuous obedience of our Lord hath obtained from God a right and power to aboliſh death. His <hi>blood</hi> hath confirmed the covenant of grace, and his goſpel hath brought life immortal into light.</p>

                  <head>Azora's account of grace.</head>
                  <p>As to the <hi>influence</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit, (Azora</hi> continued) that there is ſuch a <hi>living prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in the human ſoul, cannot I think be denied, if revelation is to be believed; but the mode of influencing is not perhaps to be explained otherwiſe than by ſaying, that our gracious and good Father makes now and then ſome friendly impreſſions upon our minds, and by repreſenting in ſeveral lights the terrors and promiſes of the goſpel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites our hopes and fears. As I apprehend, we can go very little further. It is eaſy I think to prove from the ſcriptures, that as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0028500100:255"/>the extraordinary aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt was neceſſary for planting <hi>chriſtianity</hi> at firſt; ſo is a ſupernatural aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, tho' not in ſo illuſtrious a manner, ſtill neceſſary to enable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the conditions of the <hi>goſpel.</hi> Tho' God has recalled the more viſible ſigns of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet to be ſure he continues to influence ſome way or other. I cannot ſuppoſe the Holy Ghoſt has wholly withdrawn himſelf from the church. The <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays) was <hi>a promiſe made to them and to their children, and to thoſe that were afar off, even as many as God ſhould call;</hi> and as human nature has the ſame weakneſs and paſſions, and extravagancies of former ages, there is as much need of a divine aſſiſtance now as in the time of the apoſtles: nay more need, I think, at preſent, as miracles are ceaſed. There muſt be a weight of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power to preſs within, as there are now no flaſhings from the ſky, or extraordinary appearances without, to prove the certainty of our religion, and make us conſider its promiſes, threatenings, and rules: but the way this ſupernatural principle acts, as before obſerved, is hard to determine, any more than what I have ſaid, and inſtead of waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our time in enquiries how the thing is done, our buſineſs is to render ourſelves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo great a bleſſing, by not grieving
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0028500100:256"/>this holy ſpirit, leſt he depart from us; and reſolving with the pſalmiſt, <hi>to walk with a perfect heart, and to ſet no wicked thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes.</hi> We muſt ſtrive to improve religious thoughts: we muſt labour hard to obey the written rules: God will then give us the <hi>grace ſufficient for us.</hi> To our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable talent of natural power to do good, our Father will add the advantages of his his ſpirit. If we deſire to be good, he will make us good in conjunction with our own application and pains; by a gradual proceſs, and human methods. If <hi>nature</hi> gives her <hi>utmoſt actings,</hi> the <hi>author</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> will move, and direct and aſſiſt her where ſhe is weak. Both the grace and the providence of God may be likened to a little ſpring concealed within a great machine: to the known given powers of the machine, the operations of it are aſcribed, and all its events imputed; yet it is the ſmall ſecreted ſpring that directs, draws, checks, and gives move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every weight and wheel. The caſe cannot be exactly alike, as a compound of matter and ſpirit is different from a machine: but it may ſuggeſt I imagine ſome imperfect idea of the affair: a very imperfect one, I confeſs, for if we were thinking ever ſo long of the matter, <hi>grace</hi> after all would be what the apoſtle calls it, an <hi>unſpeakable gift</hi> — A gift ſurmounting our apprehenſions as well as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0028500100:257"/>it does our merit. The theory of it may be perhaps too excellent for us, and our part is, not to determine how, but with honeſt hearts to pray, that a ray from heaven may open, and ſhine upon our underſtanding, clear it from prejudices and impoſtures, and render it teachable, conſiderative and firm; may inſpire good thoughts, excite good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and ſuggeſt wholeſome counſels and expedients. This the divine power may eaſily do, without depriving us of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, or leſſening our own moral agency. That power may extinguiſh an imagination we ſtrive to get rid of: may remove an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment we labour to be freed from: may foil a temptation we do our beſt to reſiſt. If we do all we can, and implore the divine aid, there is no doubt but the Almighty may give his free creatures ſuch powers and diſpoſitions, as will carry them innocently and ſafely thro' the trial of this firſt ſtate. On ſuch conditions, God, the Father of ſpirits, the friend of men, the patron of righteouſneſs and all virtue, will, without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diſtribute his grace to every mortal in proportion to the meaſures of neceſſary duty.</p>

                  <p>Here <hi>Azora</hi> ended,  and I ſat for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after in great admiration. Her fancy furniſhed ideas ſo very faſt, and ſpeaking was ſo very eaſy to her, without one pang in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0028500100:258"/>the delivery, or the leaſt heſitation for hours, as ſhe could, if ſhe pleaſed, ſo long diſcourſe; her judgment was ſo ſtrong, and her words ſo proper and well placed, that ſhe appeared to me a prodigy in ſpeaking, and I could have liſtened to her with delight and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the whole night. But exactly at ten o'clock, the old woman I mentioned before, who firſt bid me welcome to <hi>Burcot Lodge,</hi> came into the chamber with candles, and <hi>Azora</hi> told me, <note place="margin">Gladuſe, the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts me to a bed in her cottage.</note> that if I would follow <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſe,</hi> ſhe would light me to bed. I did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, after wiſhing the ladies good night, and my guide brought me to her own cottage, which was next door to the grotto. She ſhewed me into a ſmall clean room, neatly and prettily furniſhed, and there I found a good bed. Down I lay as ſoon as I could, being much fatigued, and as the ſun was riſing, got up again, to write what I could remember to have heard <hi>Azora</hi> ſay. My memory from my childhood has been very extraordinary. I believe there are few living exceed me in this reſpect. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of what I read and hear, remains with me, as if the book was ſtill before me, or the ſpeaker going on. This enables me to write down, with much exactneſs, what I care to note, and I can do it for the moſt part in the relater's or talker's own words, if I minute it in my ſhort hand within twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0028500100:259"/>hours after reading or diſcourſing. Upon this account, I can ſay, that I loſt very little of all that <hi>Azora</hi> was pleaſed to let me hear; or, of the diſcourſes I had with her ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous companion, <hi>Antonia Fletcher.</hi>

                  <p>When I had done writing,  I went out to wait upon the ladies, and found them in their fine gardens, buſily employed in the uſeful and innocent diverſion which the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of ſome of the greateſt beauties of the creation affords. They had every kind of fruit tree in their ground, every plant and flower that grows, and ſuch a variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic rarities from the hotter climates, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my admiration, and finely entertained me for many an hour, during my ſtay in this place. They both underſtood gardening to perfection, and continually lent their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands to the propagation of every thing. The digging and laborious work was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by many young women, who did it with great activity and underſtanding, and the nicer parts theſe ladies executed. I was aſtoniſhed and delighted with their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of various kinds. It was beautiful to ſee with what exquiſite ſkill they uſed the knife, managed graffs and cyons, directed the branches and twigs in poſture on eſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, and raiſed flowers. They had every thing in perfection in their kitchen garden and phyſic garden. Their fruits, roots, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0028500100:260"/>herbs for the table, were moſt excellent: their collection of herbs for medicine the moſt valuable: and as the whole contrivance of the gardens was <hi>near nature,</hi> and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>graſs, gravel,</hi> and variety of <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens,</hi> I was led with delight thro' the whole, till I came into the green-houſe.

                  <p>Immediately after my arrival,  breakfaſt was brought in there, chocolate and toaſts, and the ladies were extremely pleaſant over it. They aſked me a great many queſtions about the world, and were ſo facetious in their remarks, and pleaſed with my odd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things, that they laughed as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily as I did, and that was at no ſmall rate.

                  <p>But at laſt we came to a fiſh-pond,  that was an acre of <hi>water,</hi> and I aſſure you, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in half an hour's time, the illuſtrious <hi>Azora</hi> not only talked more of fiſh and ponds than the ingenious and honourable <hi>Roger North,</hi> of <hi>Rougham</hi> in Norfolk, hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on theſe ſubjects in his excellent diſcourſe, printed in 1713; but, mentioned many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things relative to them, which Mr. <hi>North</hi> was a ſtranger to. She told me, among other matters, that there was only <hi>pike</hi> and <hi>perch</hi> in her pond, and that the reaſon of it was, becauſe ſhe loved <hi>pike</hi> above all fiſh, and as the <hi>jacks</hi> were <hi>fiſh</hi> of <hi>prey,</hi> no fiſh but the <hi>perch</hi> could live with them: The <hi>perch</hi> on account of the thorny fins on its back, eſcapes the <hi>pike</hi>'s voracious appetite. She farther informed me, that the <hi>jacks</hi> in her <hi>pond</hi> were the fineſt in the world, as I would ſee at dinner, and that the reaſon of it was owing to the high feeding ſhe took care they had every day: beſide the entrails of what fowl and ſheep her people killed for her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and themſelves, the pike had blood and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0028500100:262"/>bran mixed in plenty, and all the frogs ſhe could get from a neighbouring fen; for of them the <hi>jacks</hi> are moſt fond. This made the fiſh extraordinary: and as the water was <hi>current</hi> thro' the pond, and the bottom of <hi>various depths</hi> from one foot, and two feet, to ſix feet, that the ſpawn may have ſhallow water to lie in, and the fry ſhallow water to ſwim in, as they both required, this was the reaſon, that one acre of water in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, produced double the quantity of fiſh to what a pond of ſtill water, and a bottom all of one depth, could have. See (<hi>Azora</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued) what multitudes there are. They know me, as I feed them myſelf every day, and tamely come up, cruel tyrants as they are, to get their meat. Here ſhe called <hi>jack, jack,</hi> and throwing in a baſket of unfortunate frogs, it was wonderful to ſee how thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring monſters appeared, and voraciouſly ſwallowed the poor things.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0028500100:264"/>daily bread;—for all the neceſſaries, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, and comforts, which thy liberal hand haſt provided for us, to ſweeten human life, and render it more agreeable than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it could be in this day of our exerciſe, probation and trial. While we live, we will praiſe and magnify thy awful name, and join in aſcribing with the glorious and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heavenly hoſt, honour, power, and thankſgiving to the eternal God, who ſits on the throne of ſupremacy unrivalled in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and power.</p>
                              <p>But eſpecially, O great and bleſſed God, adored be thy goodneſs for ſo loving the world, as to give thy only begotten Son, to the end, that all who believe in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; for his humbling himſelf even to the death upon the croſs, and ſhedding his blood for the remiſſion of our ſins. Great and marvellous are thy works of mercy, O Lord God Almighty! who can utter all thy praiſe? Praiſe our God, all ye his ſervants, and ye that fear him, ſmall and great. Amen; allelujah. Bleſſing and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
                              <p>O God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, have mercy on us duſt and ſin, weakneſs and imperfection, and enter not into ſtrict judgment with us, thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0028500100:265"/>and unworthy ſervants. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with ſhame and grief, that we have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated thine holy laws, and abuſed thy tender mercies: that we have followed too much the devices and deſires of our own hearts, and in numberleſs inſtances have offended againſt a moſt righteous governor, a moſt tender and compaſſionate Father, and a moſt kind and bounteous benefactor. In thought, word, and deed, many have been our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: and many are ſtill our imperfections. We have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and have thereby deſerved thy juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. But our hope and confidence is in thine infinite mercy, O God, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy promiſes declared unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord, thou wilt ſpare them who confeſs their faults, and reſtore them that are penitent. We do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly repent, and are heartily ſorry for all our misdoings. Thro' faith we offer up the Lamb that was ſlain to the eternal God for the redemption of our ſouls; believing the worthineſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be a full, perfect, and ſufficient ſacrifice, oblation and atonement for the ſins of a repenting world, and therefore reſolving, with all our ſtrength, to imitate his ſpotleſs virtue, and perfect obedience. Pardon us, then, we beſeech thee, and blot out our iniquities. Deliver us, we pray, in the name of the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0028500100:266"/>Lord Jeſus, from the evil conſequences of all our tranſgreſſions and follies, and give us ſuch powers and diſpoſitions as will carry us innocently and ſafely thro' all future trials.</p>
                              <p>Create in us, O God, pure hearts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new right ſpirits within us. Caſt thy bright beams of light upon our ſouls, and irradiate our underſtandings with the rays of that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which ſitteth on the right hand of thy throne. Let thy holy ſpirit enable us to act up to the dignity of our reaſonable nature, and ſuitably to the high character, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hopes of chriſtians: that we may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate the affairs and tranſactions of time to ſerve the intereſt of our ſouls in eternity: that we may ſhake off this vain world, and breathe after immortality and glory: that we may live in perfect reconciliation with the law of everlaſting righteouſneſs, truth, and goodneſs; and ſo comply with thy nature, mind, and will, O eternal and ſovereign ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou God moſt wonderful in all perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we may fully anſwer the relation we ſtand in to thee. Relieve and eaſe our conſciences, O bleſſed God, by the blood of ſprinkling, according to our ſeveral condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of body and mind; and ſupply us with ſuitable grace and ſtrength.</p>
                              <p>We beſeech thee, in the next place, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Lord, to take us into thy protection this day, and ſuffer no Being to injure us, no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotune
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0028500100:267"/>to befal us, nor us to hurt ourſelves by any error or miſconduct of our own. Give us, O God, a clear conception of things, and in all dangers and diſtreſſes, ſtretch forth the right hand of thy Majeſty to help and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us. From ſickneſs and pain, and from all evil and miſchief, good Lord deliver us this day, and be propitious unto us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee.</p>
                              <p>And while we remain in this world, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, ſecure us from every thing that is terrible and hurtful, and keep us in peace and ſafety. From all ſad accidents and calamitous events, from all tormenting pains and grievous diſeaſes, good Lord deliver us; and bleſs us with ſo much health and proſperity, as will enable us to paſs our time here in contentment and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                              <p>And when the time of our diſſolution cometh, by the appointment of thy adorable wiſdom, O Father of mercies and the God of all comforts, grant us a decent and happy exit; without diſtraction of mind or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of body: let thy ſervants depart in peace, and ſuddenly die in the Lord.</p>
                              <p>We pray, likewiſe, for the happineſs of all mankind: that they may all know, and obey, and worſhip thee, O Father, in ſpirit and in truth, and that all who name the name of Chriſt, may depart from iniquity,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0028500100:268"/>and live as becomes his holy goſpel. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to help and comfort all who are in danger, neceſſity, ſickneſs, and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that it may pleaſe thee to ſanctify their afflictions, and in thy good time to deliver them out of all their diſtreſſes. If we have any enemies, O Lord forgive them, and turn their hearts.</p>

Then all the people joined, and a pſalm was ſung to perfection indeed. <hi>Azora</hi> and <hi>Antonia</hi> had delightful voices, and as they underſtood muſic very well, they had taught this congregation ſo much church har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as enabled them to perform beyond any thing I have ever heard in any aſſembly of people.—The whole ſcene was a ſtrange and pleaſing thing.

They appeared in high admiration of God, endeared to his righteous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, devoted to his holy laws, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn to imitate him in all his imitable perfections.

So much beautiful religion I had not often ſeen in any aſſembly. They had a true ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the love and goodneſs of God, and of the grace and charity of Jeſus Chriſt.

                           <hi>gold;</hi> but the quantity is ſo ſmall that it bears no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the expence of getting it out: this laſt way the Spagyriſts never attempt; and as for the two other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, <hi>maturation, and tranſmuting by the grand elixir,</hi> the <hi>happy hour</hi> will never come, tho' ſo many ingenious men have often thought it drawing nigh. To conſole them for the loſs of their fortunes they have had ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable moments of reflexion, that they have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome minutes of ſucceſs, when crack! all is gone and vaniſhed on a ſudden, and they have nothing before them but <hi>cinders</hi> and <hi>broken crucibles.</hi> It is very ſtrange then, that a man of Dr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi>'s great veracity and ſkill in chimiſtry, ſhould affirm the thing was actually done in his preſence by an <hi>adept.</hi> (Epiſtola ad mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum de quinteſſentia philoſophorum, etc. Oxon. 1686.) and the more ſo, as his friend, the great Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> told him the thing was an impoſſibility. <hi>Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſon</hi>'s words are, Nec potui ſane quantacunque mihi fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit opinio de iſta re, quin aliquoties animi penderem do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec illuſtris ea demonſtratio quam veſtra excellentia, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennio jam elapſo, coram exhibuit, omnem anſam dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi mihi praecidiſſet—Placuit dominationi veſtrae claro experimento ante oculos facto animum meum ad opus accendere etiam quaeſtionum mearum ſolutiones (quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum licerat) promittere. — This is very ſurpriſing; and the more ſo, as the greateſt watchings and cloſeſt application, in ſearching after the <hi>ſtone,</hi> are all in vain, unleſs the ſtars ſhed a propitious influence on the labours of the Spagyriſt: the work muſt be begun and advance in proper planetary hours, and depends as much on <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial aſtrology,</hi> as on <hi>fire, camphire, ſalt, labour</hi> and <hi>patience:</hi> but <hi>judicial aſtrology</hi> is no ſcience. It is a mere farce. I muſt conclude then, that the hands of <hi>Mundanus</hi> the <hi>adept,</hi> were too quick for the doctor's eyes, and he deceived him by <hi>legerdemain:</hi> that all the


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0028500100:279"/>

books on the ſubject are fraudulent deſcriptions to deceive the credulous; — and what <hi>Mundanus</hi> told <hi>Dickin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of <hi>Sir George Ripley,</hi> canon of <hi>Bridlington,</hi> in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, in the reign of Edward the Fourth, and of <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Lully,</hi> was mere innovation. He affirmed that <hi>Ripley</hi> ſent the <hi>knights of Rhodes</hi> an <hi>hundred thouſand pounds</hi> to ſupport them in their wars againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> and that <hi>Lully</hi> aſſiſted <hi>Edward</hi> I. king of England, with <hi>ſix millions of gold,</hi> towards carrying on the <hi>cruiſade.</hi> This piece of ſecret hiſtory he aſſures us he found in an antient manuſcript of indiſputable authority, <hi>quod incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patae fidei regiſtris innoteſeit:</hi> A M. S. that no one ever ſaw except <hi>Mundanus. Penes me</hi> indeed. It was to be found only in his own head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ripley</hi> is in great repute among the <hi>adepts</hi> to this day, and his famous unintelligible and myſterious book is called <hi>a compound of alchymie contryning twelve gates.</hi> He inſcribed the manuſcript to <hi>Edward</hi> IV. but the editor of it dedicated it to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſays, it contained the right method of making the <hi>philoſopher's ſtone</hi> and <hi>aurum potabile. Lully</hi> was a very learned man for the latter end of the 13th century, and writ ſeveral books in Latin; — <hi>Generales artium libri. — Libri logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cales, phileſophici et metaphiſici. — Variarum artium libri. — Libri ſpirituales praedicabiles</hi> — and the <hi>vade mecum Lulli;</hi> which is a Latin piece on the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>aurum potabile</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ripley,</hi> which then and long after was eſteemed a <hi>panacea,</hi> or <hi>univerſal medicine,</hi> it is now a queſtion if there can be a <hi>tincture of gold;</hi> for if it be only a <hi>diviſion</hi> of the <hi>leſts,</hi> or <hi>minims</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> by the <hi>ſpicula</hi> of <hi>aqua regia,</hi> and theſe minims thrown into oil of roſemary where they ſwim, it is no radical tincture of gold, and the ſole virtue lies in the oil of roſemary. The oil may be evaporated; the gold duſt remains; and that by melting is reduced to a lump of


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0028500100:280"/>


gold again. This I have experimented. But the alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts ſay, gold may be reduced into a gum of ſubſtance like honey, without any corroſive, and that gum ſteeped in ſpirit of wine acquires a ruby colour. An ounce of this is to be mixed with 16 ounces of another liquor, and we have <hi>aurum potabile;</hi> ſovereign in all diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. This ſeems to me to be a ſecond part of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. The making of this golden gum is a ſecret we can no more come at than the philoſophers ſtone. The <hi>adepts</hi> however affirm it, and aſſure us, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could make <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> as is evident from his <hi>pulveriſing</hi> the <hi>golden calf,</hi> and giving it to the children of Iſrael to


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0028500100:281"/>

drink. This great man, who wrote 540 years before <hi>Homer:</hi> 200 before <hi>Sanchoniatho;</hi> and 350 before the <hi>Trojan</hi> war, was, as they inform us, an <hi>adept.</hi>

This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0028500100:278"/>wiſe came to nothing, and inſtead of the gold he expected, he had only heaps of <hi>Mercury</hi> fixed with <hi>verdegreaſe,</hi> (which

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0028500100:280"/>and the adept made off. Too late this good and learned man ſaw he had been impoſed on, and that the <hi>Spagyriſts</hi> are what Dr. <hi>Dickenſon</hi> calls them <hi>Enigmatiſtinubivagi.</hi>

                  <p>Chymiſtry, reader, is a fine and antient art. The analyſing of ſenſible bodies by fire, to diſcover their real powers and virtues, is highly praiſe-worthy, and the ſurpriſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments we make, fill the mind of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer after truth, with the greateſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the wonderful author of nature: but more than this is a ſad romance that ends in empty pockets. Never think then of the <hi>hermetical banquet, Glauber's golden aſs,</hi> or the <hi>philoſopher's magical gold.</hi> By the law of honeſt induſtry, endeavour to be rich if you can, for this ſole reaſon, that it is more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give than to receive; and if that lies not within your capacity, or means, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with peace and little. There is more true happineſs in daily bread and the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the divine and ſocial virtues, than in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0028500100:281"/>tons of gold without holineſs and a ſtrong attachment to virtue.</p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Burcot</hi> found he had almoſt ruined himſelf, and that he was no longer able to live as he had done, he laid his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy caſe before his daughter <hi>Azora,</hi> and aſked her advice, What he ſhould do? To retire immediately, <hi>(Azora</hi> ſaid) to this part of <hi>Stanemore,</hi> which was an unvalued part of his eſtate, and bring as many of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants as he could perſuade to inhabit this fine tract of land: — to ſell what remained of his fortune, and with the money procure as many of the neceſſaries or comforts of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as could be had: to get in particular ſome young tradeſmen and their wives by offered rewards in this place; to build cottages for the people; and render the fine caverns in the rock as habitable and pleaſing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as art could render them. Here, <hi>(A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zora</hi> told her father) we ſhall live more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than we could do, if ſtill poſſeſſed of a fortune to make an appearance in the world. We ſhall enjoy by induſtry and prudence every good thing that rational life can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and live ſecured from the ſtrokes of fortune, and the world's contempt. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to vanity and the pleaſures of high life, in this delightful retreat, we ſhall paſs our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0028500100:282"/>days as in a region of goodneſs, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and joy; and the predominant bent of our hearts will be to wiſdom, and virtue, and to aſcend into the realms of perfect day. — Happy advice, (the father of <hi>Azora</hi> ſaid), and the thing was immediately done. A colony was quickly eſtabliſhed here, and every thing was ſettled and ordered in the moſt advantageous manner. Cattle, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and grain to ſow the land were ſent in; cloaths and every material the little republic could want were provided, and every hand was as uſeful as we could wiſh. For four years <hi>(Azora</hi> continued to inform me), we lived in peace and tranquillity, and never once regretted the loſs of our fortunes. We were happier far than when we had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. Induſtry, knowledge, and religion, were our employment. The night to come of pain and death gave us no uneaſineſs. We lived as the chriſtians of the two firſt centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and rather longed for than feared that event, which is to remove us to growing brightneſs for ever and ever. But a fever came in among us, and ſwept away my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every man of our little republic: ſeveral women likewiſe periſhed; but a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſouls remained. Ninety-eight women, beſides <hi>Antonia</hi> and <hi>Azora.</hi> Theſe loved me too well <hi>(Azora</hi> continued) to abandon me; and as they were happily ſituated, and many of them had learned their huſband's
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0028500100:283"/>trades, they agreed and ſwore to ſpend their lives with me here, and be as ſerviceable as poſſible, without admitting any men to live among us. They are ſo in the higheſt degree: they are all uſeful and pious as I could wiſh them, and under the heavens there is not a happier ſociety of mortal. We have the beſt of every thing: all we want, and in reaſon could wiſh for.</p>

                  <head>A farther account of Azora</head>
                  <p>Here <hi>Azora</hi> ended her relation,  and I wondered greatly at what I heard; nor did my admiration leſſen when I ſaw how ſhe governed this community, and they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their time. Her great underſtanding enlightened and directed them, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of every thing ſerviceable and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious; and ſhe lived before their eyes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the greateſt induſtry, and the moſt exalted piety. They, on the other hand, were as uſeful and religious as poſſible, and ſo heartily and faithfully diſcharged ſocial duties, in every inſtance, that they ſeemed as one great capacity and power at work, to promote every convenience and good. Some of them, as I have ſaid, were at work in the gardens: others in the fields: various trades and occupations were going on within doors and without, and all were employed in ways that beſt ſubſerved the general welfare. In their behaviour, there was nothing wild, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, or arch, to be ſeen: no ſwellings of vanity and pride: no paſſion to diſoblige: no
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0028500100:284"/>intention to offend: but, every one, diſcreet and calm; good-humoured, and very civil; worthily ſuſtaining their various relations, and each attentive to her own incumbent duty. Their labours were but a diverſion to them, and they lived in tranquillity and plenty. Their cloathing was coarſe, but very good, clean, and handſome. There was not one ragged or dirty perſon among them; nor any with bad ſhoes and ſtockings. In all reſpects, they ſeemed a moſt happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. <hi>Azora</hi> ſtudied, to the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the advantage and happineſs of theſe people: and they, in return, made their duty a vigorous and chearful ſervice. Moſt of the conveniences and comforts of life they had within their own lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle territory; fleſh and fiſh, mutton, kid, and veniſon; corn for bread, every vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; malt-drink, meath, and cyder; all in great plenty, and moſt excellent; wool and flax for clothing; good candles; and wood enough for firing. What things they wanted two of them rid for to the neareſt town, and not only purchaſed ſuch goods with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they got by ſale of ſeveral commodities; eſpecially knit thread ſtockings and gloves; but always at ſuch times brought in ſome caſh to their miſtreſs, and ſhe gave part of it among the people, to buy them little things they fanſied.</p>

                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0028500100:285"/>As to the ten young women I mentioned, who walked after <hi>Azora</hi> when firſt I ſaw her, they were the daughters of ſome wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in this little republic, and by her choſen, not only to be her attendants and upper ſervants, and to look after her dairy, her bees, her poultry; and her aviary; (which was the fineſt I have ever ſeen, for the variety of birds, and as it was turfed, to avoid the appearance of foulneſs on the floor, and ſo large as to give the birds ſome freedom of flight); but, on account of their good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in which they far excelled their fellows. Theſe girls were carefully inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Azora</hi> and <hi>Antonia,</hi> and beſide being taught the fine works of the needle, learned muſick, and the elements of the mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks from the ladies. The eldeſt of theſe girls was but twenty, and the youngeſt eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and they all ſurprized me very greatly with their quickneſs in anſwering very hard arithmetical queſtions. They could not only add, ſubtract, multiply, divide, find a fourth proportional, and extract roots of every kind, with exactneſs and readineſs, and apply them upon all common occaſions; but, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in fractions vulgar and decimal. They had even gone as far in algebra as the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſimple equations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0028500100:286"/>Finding them one morning at figures, I aſked the youngeſt of them, What was the number, that ⅔ of it with 4 over, amounted to the ſame as 7/12 of it with 9 over? She immediately tranſlated the queſtion from common language into algebra 2<hi>x</hi>/3 + 4 = 7<hi>x</hi>/12 + 9: and quickly diſcovered the unknown quantity <hi>x</hi> to be <hi>x</hi>=60: Then ſhe took it in ſinthetically, ⅔ of 60 = 40 + 4 = 44: 7/12 of 60 = 35 + 9 = 44. — <hi>(Sinthetically</hi> is tracing property from number: —<hi>Analetically</hi> is tracing number from property.) This made me wonder very greatly. I aſked another of them, if ſhe bought 20 loaves for 16 pence, all of them two-penny, penny, and farthing ones — how many would ſhe have of each? She anſwered 5 two-penny loaves, 3 penny ones, and 12 farthing loaves; for the equations were <hi>x</hi> + <hi>y</hi> + <hi>z</hi> = 20 and 8<hi>x</hi> + 4<hi>y</hi> = <hi>z</hi> = 64. From whence by ſubtraction, 7<hi>x</hi> + 3<hi>y</hi> = 44, and of conſequence, y = 44 − 7<hi>x</hi>/3 = 14 − 2<hi>x</hi> + 2 − x / 3;</p>
                  <p>I aſked a third, how many ways ſhe could pay 20 l. in piſtoles, guineas, and moidores, at 17 s. 21 s, and 27 s. the piſtole, the guinea, and the moidore? — She replied in a very little time, 9 ways, to wit, 11 piſtoles, 5 gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, and 4 moidores — 8 piſtoles, 1 guinea, 9 moidores— 8 piſtoles, 10 guineas, 2 moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores — 17 piſtoles, 4 guineas, 1 moidore — 2 piſtoles, 2 guineas, 12 moidores — 2 piſtoles,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0028500100:287"/>11 guineas, 5 moidores — 5 piſtoles, 6 guineas, 7 moidores — 5, 15, 0 — and 14 piſtoles, 0 guineas, 6 moidores. This was a hard opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I aſked another of theſe young women, if her lady gave her 297 guineas and 339 piſtoles, to pay 6 men a hundred pounds a-piece in gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas and piſtoles only, as was agreed, how could ſhe contrive to pay them, and diſpatch the thing? I will tell you, ſir, (ſhe anſwered) very ſoon. <hi>x</hi> repreſents my guineas, and <hi>y</hi> my piſtoles, and 21<hi>x</hi> + 17<hi>y</hi> = 2000, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, x = 2000 − 17<hi>y</hi>/21 = 95 + 5 − 17<hi>y</hi>/21; etc. and quickly diſcovered, that the firſt man ſhould have 92 guineas and 4 piſtoles: — the ſecond man, 75 guineas and 25 piſtoles: — the third, 58 guineas, 46 piſtoles — the fourth, 41 guineas and 67 piſtoles — the fifth, 24 gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas and 88 piſtoles: — and the ſixth man, 7 guineas and 109 piſtoles. This was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But is there no other way I ſaid of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 100 l. in guineas and piſtoles, beſides the ſix ways you have mentioned? There is no other way: (the fine girl anſwered). If a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth man was to be paid 100 l. in theſe two kinds of money, he muſt be paid in one of theſe ſix methods. This was true. I was charmed with what I had heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0028500100:288"/>While I was thus engaged with the maids, <hi>Azora</hi> and <hi>Antonia</hi> came into the room, and finding how I had been employed, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk of problems, theorems, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quations, and ſoon convinced me, that I was not ſuperior to them in this kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; tho' I had ſtudied it for a much longer time, and had taken more pains than ever they did. Their fine underſtandings ſaw at once the things that had made me ſweat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an hour, and in leſs time than I required for an operation, they could anſwer the moſt difficult queſtions, and do any thing in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple quadratic equations, and in the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſolution of ratios. This I thought very wonderful; eſpecially as they had been taught no longer than one year by Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot;</hi> and that they had acquired the moſt abſtruſe part of their knowledge by their own application. — I note the thing down as one of the ſtrangeſt and moſt extraordinary caſes that ever came in my way; perhaps, that ever was heard. It is ſuch a ſpecimen of female underſtanding, as muſt for ever knock up the poſitive aſſertions of ſome learned men, who will not allow that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have as ſtrong reaſoning heads as the men.</p>

                  <p>By the way, I obſerve, excluſive of theſe two ladies, that I have ſeen many of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0028500100:289"/>ſex who were diſtinguiſhed for accuracy and comprehenſiveneſs, not only in the ſcience, where known and required qualities are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by letters, but in other fine parts of learning. I have little right to pretend to any thing extraordinary in underſtanding, as my genius is ſlow, and ſuch as is common in the lower claſſes of men of letters; yet, my application has been very great: my whole life has been ſpent in reading and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and nevertheleſs, I have met with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women, in my time, who, with very little reading, have been too hard for me on ſeveral ſubjects. In juſtice, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this; and am very certain from what I have heard numbers of them ſay, and ſeen ſome of them write, that if they had the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured education the men have, and applied to books with all poſſible attention for as many years as we do; there would be found among them as great <hi>divines</hi> as <hi>Epiſcopius, Limborch, Whichcote, Barrow, Tillotſon,</hi> and <hi>Clarke;</hi> and as great <hi>mathematicians,</hi> as <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurin, Saunderſon,</hi> and <hi>Simpſon.</hi> The cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks may laugh at this aſſertion, I know they will: and, if they pleaſe, they may doubt my veracity as to what I relate of the two ladies, and the ten young women, in <hi>Burcot-Hamlet;</hi> but what I ſay is true not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. Facts are things too ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0028500100:290"/>to be deſtroyed by laughing and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>As to the ladies I have mentioned, they both did wonders in <hi>ſpecious arithmetick;</hi> but <hi>Azora</hi> was the brighteſt of the two, and in <hi>pure algebra,</hi> had gone much farther than <hi>Antonia.</hi> With wonder I beheld her, while ſhe anſwered the moſt difficult queſtions as faſt as fingers could move; and in the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cubics, and the reſolution of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both according to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> laborious method, and the better univerſal way, by <hi>converging ſeries,</hi> work with a celerity and truth beyond what I have ever ſeen any man do. Nor was it only algebra independent of geometry that ſhe underſtood. She could apply its reaſoning to geometrical figures, and deſcribe the loci of any equations by the mechanical motion of angles and lines. She was in this reſpect the greateſt prodigy I ever ſaw.</p>
                  <p>But it was not on account of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that I ſo much admired <hi>Azora,</hi> and honour her memory ſo greatly as I do; nor becauſe ſhe talked ſo excellently on various ſubjects, as I have related; but, for her knowledge of the truths of chriſtianity, and the habits of goodneſs ſhe had wrought into her ſoul; for the care ſhe took of the people under her government, by communicating every felicity in her power, to their bodies
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0028500100:291"/>and minds; and the pure religion of Chriſt Jeſus, which ſhe publickly maintained, in all the beauty of holineſs, and in a juſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of practice. She was herſelf, in her manners and piety, a fine copy of thoſe bleſſed women who converſed with our Lord and his apoſtles: and her ſociety, in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and goodneſs, in uſefulneſs and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeemed an epitome of the firſt chriſtian church at Jeruſalem. Under a juſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the moſt heavenly principles they all lived, and ſtrictly regarded their ſeveral offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As the goſpel directs, they worſhipped a <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Deity,</hi> as the diſciples of the Chriſt of God, our holy mediator; and the authority of a Being of infinite wiſdom, and unchangeable rectitude of nature, had made ſuch an impreſſion upon their minds, that they laboured continually to acquire that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration</hi> and <hi>ſanctity</hi> of heart and manners, which our divine religion requires. Excellent community! happy would <hi>Europe</hi> be, if all her ſtates were like this people. A falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would not then prevail; nor would <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> be the <hi>idol</hi> to which the world bows down. The <hi>evils,</hi> which now diſhonour human nature, and infeſt ſociety, would not be ſeen among us; nor thoſe <hi>exceſſes</hi> of <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> be known, which are the parent of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and calamity, and render this lower world one ſcene of ſin and ſorrow: but, as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0028500100:292"/>revelation inculcates, as reaſon ſuggeſts, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would worſhip the <hi>Almighty Principle,</hi> the <hi>One God,</hi> the <hi>Only True God,</hi> with a worſhip ſuitable to the nature of a Being, who is not confined to, or dependent upon, particular places and circumſtances, who is always, and every where preſent with us; and like the miniſters attending on the glorious throne of the Monarch of the world, they would, according to their meaſure, be <hi>pure, benevolent</hi> mortals, and as <hi>perfect</hi> in <hi>goodneſs,</hi> as men can be within the degree and limit of their nature.—In a word, the <hi>Supreme Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all things</hi> would then be the God of all chriſtians; and in doing his will, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating his perfections, and in practiſing every thing recommended by the great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal law of reaſon, (that law which God ſent our Lord to revive and enforce), they would find the greateſt pleaſure. Such were the people of <hi>Burcot-Hamlet. Azora</hi> and <hi>Antonia</hi> were indeed moſt glorious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                           <hi>Azora Burcot</hi> died in the year thirty two, ſix years after I left them, but <hi>Antonia Fletcher</hi> is ſtill living in the ſame happy ſituation; and by adviſing the young women to marry ſome young men of thoſe mountains, has made an alteration in the community for the better, and encreaſed the number of her people. The ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now like to continue, and they find many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from having men among them. The riſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0028500100:293"/>


thereby acquired, now proves a bleſſing to the firſt colony, whom years have rendered much weaker and dependent than when I firſt ſaw them. <hi>Azora,</hi> a little before ſhe died, did intend to get in a recruit of female children for the ſupport of the ſociety: but <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia</hi> judged it was much better, to let the young girls of the community get honeſt youths for their ſpouſes; for, by this means, they can never want young people to aſſiſt and comfort them, and to encreaſe and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their happy republic. For theſe reaſons, ſhe ſent for ſome young men to ſeveral neighbouring villages in <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> to make ſeveral things wanting, and to dig, and work in the gardens, for ſo much by the year certain; and as they were ſmitten with the clean, civil girls of <hi>Burcot-Hamlet,</hi> ſeveral marriages ſoon enſued, and infants were produced before the twelve months had expired. More than half of the twenty women that married, had twins the firſt year, and all of them had ſtrong, healthy children. The ten extraordinary girls I mentioned, got very good huſbands, and as <hi>Antonia</hi> was particularly kind to them on their marrying, and gave to all the wedded folks great encouragement in profitable gardens and houſes, grain and cattle, they and their ſpouſes became rather more dutiful and uſeful to their miſtreſs and ruler than otherwiſe, and in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and for the ſake of their children, did their beſt to pleaſe Mrs. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> and encreaſe the common feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. In this condition I found them on my ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Burcot-Hamlet.</hi> They were a flouriſhing village, and a moſt happy people. My ſecond viſit was fourteen years after the firſt; and I ſaw them a third time in the year fifty two. They were then all well, and enjoyed every comfort of life that can proceed from good and uſeful manners. Mrs. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> tho' now in years, has

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0028500100:294"/>


no ſign of age in her conſtitution, and ſtill leads a moſt active and pious life. She is a ſubaltern providence to them, and with the tendereſt care, makes it the labour of her every day, to ſecure and advance the temporal and eternal intereſt of the people: but their ſouls is her main care. She performs to them divine ſervice twice every day, as good <hi>Azora</hi> was wont to do. She reads the beſt ſermons to the aged, and conſtantly catechiſes the young ones. She is a bleſſed woman.</p>
                        <p>By the way, reader, I muſt obſerve to you, that in travelling over that part of <hi>Richmondſhire,</hi> which is called <hi>Stanemore,</hi> I found ſeveral ſmall villages, that are not mentioned in <hi>Camden,</hi> or the <hi>Britannia Antiqua et Nova,</hi> or in <hi>England's Gazetteer;</hi> and tho' not ſo pretty and happy as <hi>Burcot</hi> in the northern end of the <hi>fells</hi> of <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> yet in tolerable condition, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on account of ſeveral things and people; tho' they live intirely on what their ſpot affords, and have little communication with their countrymen beyond the mountains that ſeparate the inhabitants of <hi>Stanemore</hi> from the reſt of England. I took notice, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that altho' thoſe poor remote people had not facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties adapted to large meaſures of knowledge, nor have miniſters to teach them, or churches to pray in; yet they were not alienated from the taſte and feelings of humanity, nor ſtrangers to the momentous principles of true chriſtianity. They had the bible, and could read it. They inſtructed their children in virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and lived themſelves as the intelligent ſubjects of an Almighty Governor; in a firm belief that God will diſtinguiſh the <hi>virtue</hi> and the <hi>offence</hi> of mankind <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> by ſuitable tokens of his <hi>favour,</hi> or <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi> All this I ſaw in ſeveral villages of <hi>Stanemore-mountains.</hi> I lived for ſome time among the poor people: And I

of <hi>Stanemore:</hi> That vaſt tract of mountains, glins, and vallies, foreſt, rock, and water, the moſt wonderful land in the world, for 40 miles to the end of the country, if it was poſſible to go ſtraight on, lies on the right hand of this road, as you ride to <hi>Brugh</hi> under <hi>Stanemore;</hi> or, on your left, as you come from <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> to <hi>Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racton</hi> or <hi>Catarriek.</hi>

Indeed, every where in the north,


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0028500100:297"/>


where the beſt of things are to be had, I have always found travelling there as expenſive as near London. Many I know give a different account: but the reaſon is, either they never were there; or, they travel in a pilgrim-like manner. You muſt take care, then, to have money enough, if ever you undertake the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern expedition I have frequently gone upon: and as it is not ſafe carrying much caſh with you, for there are rogues in that part of the world, as well as in this; they rob even on <hi>Stanemore-road;</hi> and in riding over the great moor that lies between <hi>Brugh</hi> and <hi>Appleby,</hi> there is a little ale-houſe to be ſeen at a good diſtance, on the right hand, at the entrance of a wood, at the bottom of a range of vaſt fells, where high-way-men ſometimes reſort: I was purſued by two of them, not long ago, and to the excellence of my horſe, owed the ſaving of my purſe, and perhaps my life: they were well mounted, but I kept an hundred yards a-head of them for ſeveral miles, while, as faſt as they could ſtretch away, they chaſed me till near the town of <hi>Brugh.</hi> I was all alone, my fellow having received a miſchief, and being obliged to ſtay a day behind; and the rogues did ſwear and hoot moſt horribly, and fired three ſhots at me; but my horſe was as good as ever ſpanked it along, and I cut him up, and pricked him over the turf, like the wind away:—I ſay, then, as it is not ſafe travelling with all the money neceſſary for ſuch a long journey, the beſt way is, when caſh runs low, to lie by to reſt for a week, and put your notes in order, in ſome town, and by one of the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or manufacturers of the place, draw on your friend, or goldſmith in London, for what you want, and by the return of the poſt, you will be paid the money where you are. In this manner I did, when I was at <hi>Richmond</hi> laſt, in the north-riding of Yorkſhire: Being


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0028500100:298"/>


in want of money, I aſked a gentleman with whom I chanced to dine, how I could ſupply myſelf with 20 l. by draft on one in the capital; and he directed me to his neighbour, who let me have what I had occaſion for at moderate exchange, as ſoon as he heard from his friend in <hi>London.</hi> I might have had any money I named in this way: and ſo, in other places of trade.</p>
                        <p>I hope, reader, you will excuſe this little digreſſion, becauſe it is meant well; and for the ſame reaſon, I imagine you will pardon me for adviſing you, in the next place, (ſhould the fates ever bring you to <hi>Catar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractonium,</hi> in order to proceed to the northern extremity of our country), to go 4 miles out of your way to ſee <hi>Richmond</hi> town, before you ſet out for <hi>Gretabridge,</hi> to <hi>Joſeph Marſhall</hi>'s, the beſt houſe of the two inns there. The delightful, romantic ſituation of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and the fine curioſities about the town, will afford you an agreeable entertainment for a couple of days; and if you like going at night to a club of very worthy, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of this town, who are very civil to ſtrangers, you may paſs the evening in a very pleaſing way; or if you have a taſte for dancing, and prefer the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fine girl to a pipe and more ſerious diſcourſe, there is a ſmall polite aſſembly of as pretty women as ever gladdened the heart of man. My method, while there, was to ſmoak one night with the club; and the next I devoted to the ladies. We made up ten couple, and had the <hi>hemp-dreſſers</hi> one night, which is, you know, if you are a dancing reader, the moſt difficult, and laborious of all the country dances; and no where have I ſeen the ground more actively beat, or, in juſter meaſure. Life and truth and charms were in perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe <hi>Richmond</hi> girls. I was there in 29, 37, and 53, and the ſenſible club, and bright aſſembly,


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0028500100:299"/>


were ſtill in being; but no more than three did I ſee, of men or women, in 37, that was there in 29; and in 52, they were all ſtrangers to me. Some were married away; ſome had removed; and others were tranſlated to the ſhades of eternity. This was to me a moral leſſon. When I looked round the aſſembly room the laſt time I was there, and found every glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous girl of my acquaintance was gone, and that years had rendered me almoſt unfit to join with the ladies then preſent, in the dancings of the night, a philoſophical ſadneſs came powerfully upon my mind, and I could not help ſighing in the midſt of harmony, and a blaze of charms. This life, I ſaw was a fleeting ſcene indeed.</p>
                        <p>And now, reader, as to <hi>Stanemore-country,</hi> if it ſhould ever come into your head, to wander over this wild and romantic part of our world, at the hazard of your neck, and the danger of being ſtarved, your <hi>route</hi> is, when you have paſſed the <hi>turnpike</hi> on Stanemore, in your way to <hi>Brugh,</hi> to turn off to the right, beyond the public-houſe, and aſcend a fine riſing valley you will ſee between two mountains, till you come to the top of the firſt hills: then proceed, if you can, in the courſe I have deſcribed, and wherever it is in your power, tend to the north eaſt, for that is the way out. This is one way into the heart of <hi>Stanemore</hi> in <hi>Richmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and will bring you, by the way, among the dreadful northern fells of <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> a frightful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a fatiguing march.</p>
                        <p>Another way to the <hi>Stanemore Alps,</hi> is behind <hi>Jack Railton</hi>'s, the quaker's houſe at <hi>Bows.</hi> Hire a guide from him, and his man will bring you as he did me once through a very ſurprizing way of deep bottoms to a public houſe at <hi>Eggleſton,</hi> on the border of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Stanemore.</hi> There reſt that night, and early the


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0028500100:300"/>


next morning, proceed due north, when you can, with another guide, and you will come to mountains upon mountains, rapid rivers, and headlong torrents, that form amazing and tremendous ſcenes. Or, as this way is neither comfortable, nor very ſafe, it is a better road to the confines, or beginning of <hi>Stanemore,</hi> to ride from <hi>Gretabridge</hi> to <hi>Bernard Caſtle,</hi> and from <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Caſtle</hi> to <hi>Eggleſton,</hi> about 16 miles, as I judge, for it is not meaſured, and then ſet out for the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from <hi>Eggleſton,</hi> as before directed.—I have been told there is another way into <hi>Stanemore,</hi> through <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi> but as I am a ſtranger to it, I can only ſay what I have heard, that it is worſe than the bottoms I went through from the quaker's houſe. This is enough, reader, to ſhew you how to get into <hi>Stanemore,</hi> if you have the curioſity and heart to viſit that very wild and wonderful land.</p>

               <p> The 18th of June, 1725, I took my leave of Mrs. <hi>Burcot</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> (for ſo they would be called, as they informed
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0028500100:294"/>me, after I had once uſed the word <hi>Miſs),</hi> and from this fine place, proceeded on my
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0028500100:295"/>journey, by a paper of written directions had received from them; as there was a pretty good, tho' a long and tedious way out
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0028500100:296"/>of the mountains, if a traveller knew the paſſes and turnings; but otherwiſe, it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible to go on; or, a man muſt journey at the hazard of his life a thouſand
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0028500100:297"/>times a day, in croſſing waters and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0028500100:298"/>Our firſt labour was to aſcend a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſteep way in the ſide of a mountain, which went up due north for a full mile, and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0028500100:299"/>brought us to another large, ſtanding, black and unfathomable water, on the top of this high hill. There was no appearance of any
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0028500100:300"/>feeders to ſupply this frightful lake, and therefore, and on account of its blackneſs, the ſurface muſt communicate with the abyſs. From this water we rid due eaſt for half an hour, and then deſcended to a ſandy valley, where flames were riſing from the ground. The fire came up without noiſe, ſmoak, or ſmell, and appeared to me very wonderful: but ſuch things are common in many parts of the world. In the ſide of one of the <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines,</hi> I have ſeen a large blazing vale. The learned tell us, this is owing to rich veins of <hi>bitumen,</hi> which crops in ſuch places, and the heat of the air between the hills, in ſhallow vallies, cauſes it to burn. This crop of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen, and accenſion by the agitation of a hot air, is well fancied, I own: but it does
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0028500100:301"/>not give me full ſatisfaction. I think of this, and many other natural things, as Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> does of the <hi>Aurora Borealis;</hi>—that theſe uncommon appearances ſhould be looked on with wonder and admiration, and raiſe in us a due reverence of their great Author, who has ſhewn his Almighty power and wiſdom in forming ſuch an infinite variety of produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all parts of the univerſe. Philoſophy undertakes to account for every thing. I am ſure it is in many caſes miſtaken.</p>

               <p> Having paſſed the burning valley, we rid over a river, that was up to the horſes bellies, very rapid, and a bad bottom, and then proceeded along a ſteep hill ſide, the courſe N. W. till we came to a rich low land, that was covered with flowers and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic ſhrubs, and adorned with ſeveral clumps of oak, cheſnut, and white walnut trees. This plain is about twenty five acres, ſurrounded with ſtony mountains, ſome of which are very high and ſteep, and from the top of one of the loweſt of them, a cataract deſcends, like the fall of the river <hi>Niagara</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> or <hi>New France,</hi> in <hi>North America.</hi> Swifter than an arrow from a bow the rapid water comes headlong down in a fall of 140 feet, which is 3 feet more than the deſcent of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agara.</hi> The river here, to be ſure, is not half ſo large as that which comes from the vaſt <hi>lakes</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> but it is a great and prodigious cadence of water, and tumbles
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0028500100:302"/>perpendicular in as ſurprizing a manner, from as horrible a precipice; and in this very nearly reſembles the <hi>Niagara-Fall;</hi> that as you ſtand below, as near the fall as it is ſafe to go, you ſee the river come down a ſloping moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for a great way, as if it deſcended from the clouds. It is a grand and amazing ſcene. The water iſſues from a great lake on the top of a mountain that I found very hard to aſcend, and the lake has many viſible feeders from hills upon hills above it, which it is impoſſible to climb.</p>

               <p> It was 12 o'clock by the time we arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this water-fall, and therefore I ſat down by the ſide of it to dine, before I attempted to get up to the top of the precipice, and ſee from whence this water came. While my eyes were entertained with the deſcending ſcene, I feaſted on a piece of veniſon paſty, and ſome fine ale, which, among other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Mrs. <hi>Burcot</hi> had ordered her ſervants to put up for me: but as I was thus happily engaged, my lad, <hi>O Fin,</hi> had climbed up to the top of the water-fall, and was going to land from a tree that grew out of the rocky mountain, near the ſummit of the hill, when his foot ſlipt, and he came tumbling down in a miſerable way. I expected him in pieces on the ground, as I had him full in my view. There ſeemed no poſſibility of an eſcape: and yet he received no harm. In the middle of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0028500100:303"/>the deſcent, he ſtuck in another projecting thick tree, and from it came ſafely down. This was a deliverance. Providence often ſaves us in a wonderful manner, 'till the work appointed to be finiſhed is done, or the limited time of our trial over. In relation to ſuch eſcapes, I could give myſelf as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance many a time, and will here mention one extraordinary caſe.</p>

                     <p>Now from this antique piece verbally tranſlated, I think it is evident, that the kings of the four provinces of Ireland were not ſuch poor and ignorant chiefs as they are generally imagined to be; and of conſequence, that one of the four, to whom the other three did homage, and who was therefore called the king of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was always a potent prince, and could do great matters, when they were all united. This conſideration, I fanſy, (and the <hi>addreſs</hi> let me add of <hi>Anſelm,</hi> archbiſhop of Canterbury, and of Lanfranc, archbiſhop of the ſame ſee, to <hi>Mortogh O Brien</hi> king of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Terlah O Brien</hi> king of <hi>Ireland, Moriardacho Glorioſo</hi> and <hi>Terae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luacho Magnifico,</hi> To the <hi>moſt magnificent Terlagh O Brien, king of Ireland,</hi> our benediction, etc. as you may read them at large in <hi>Uſher's Primordia</hi>

There was no end of eating and drinking there, and the famous <hi>Downe Falvey</hi> played on the harp. For a day and a night we ſat
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0028500100:306"/>to it by candle-light, without ſhirts or cloaths on; naked, excepting that we had our breeches and ſhoes and ſtockings on;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0028500100:307"/>and I drank ſo much burgundy in that time, that the ſweat ran of a red colour down my body; and my ſenſes were ſo diſordered, that when we agreed to ride out for a couple of hours to take a little air, I leaped my horſe into a dreadful quarry, and in the deſcent was thrown into a large deep water that was in a part of the frightful bottom, and by that means ſaved my life. When I came above water, I ſwam very eaſily out of the pit, and walked up the low ſide of the quarry as ſober as if I had not drank a glaſs. This is a fact, whatever the critics may ſay of the thing. All I can ſay to it is, my hour was not come.</p>

               <p> Having dined, and ſhot a <hi>buſtard</hi> that weighed forty pounds, I went on again, the courſe north-weſt for half a mile, and then, to my aſtoniſhment, it trended to the ſouth for more than an hour; which was going back again: but at laſt it turned about, and for half an hour, we went to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt again, and then due eaſt for a long time, till we came to hills upon hills that were
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0028500100:308"/>very difficult to paſs. We were obliged to alight at many of them, and walk them up and down, which was a delay of many hours: but we did it at laſt, and came into a large ſandy opening, that had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rapid ſtreams breaking over it, that fell from the mountains, and with the foreſt on the ſurrounding hills, formed a very wild and pleaſing ſcene. Over this we went for half a mile, and then came to a long glin, ſo very deep and narrow, that it was quite night when we got to the bottom of it, tho' the ſun was not yet down; and it brought to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <hi>Anchiſes</hi>'s ſon, the wandering prince of <hi>Troy,</hi> when he deſcended to the ſhades below. It had the appearance indeed of ſome ſuch paſs, and was a frightful way, as hills, like <hi>Caucaſus</hi> and <hi>Atlas,</hi> were cloſe on either hand of us, and a river roared thro' the bottom of the ſteep deſcent; which we were obliged to walk down on foot. This could not be the right road I was certain. <hi>Azora</hi> and <hi>Antonia</hi> could never paſs this deep and rapid flood. It was too much for any man to venture into, without knowing where the torrent went, or how the channel of the river was form'd.</p>
               <p>Up then I came again to the day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to paſs the night at the foot of one of the woody hills, on the margin of the ſtreams that ſounded ſweetly over the ſhoars:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0028500100:309"/>but how to proceed the next morning I knew not. As my paper of directions did not mention the dark ſteep deſcent we had been down, but a little valley that lay due eaſt, through which we were to go: no ſuch vale could we ſee, and of conſequence, in ſome turning of the road, we had gone wrong.</p>
               <p>When I came among the trees, on the ſide of one of the mountains, I began to look for ſome convenient reſting place, while my two boys were picking the buſtard, and preparing a fire to roaſt it for ſupper, and wandered a good way till I ſaw a pretty hermitage in an open plain like a ring, and going up to it, found the ſkeleton of a man. He lay on a couch in an inward room without any cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the bones were as clean and white as if they had come from the ſurgeons hands.

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0028500100:310"/>that profligate prince aſcended the throne. I drank up to the exceſs of the times: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched every woman I could get within my power, by gold, treachery, or force; maid, wife, and widow: I murdered ſeveral men in duels; and blaſphemed the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven continually. The <hi>devil</hi> was my firſt and laſt <hi>toaſt;</hi> and, in a club I belonged to, I proceeded to ſuch ſcarce credible wickedneſs, as to perform the part of the prieſt in our infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſodality, and after uſing the words of conſecration over the elements, gave the prophane bread and wine in the moſt horrible manner.

All my crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon crimes were held as in a mirror before me; the moſt diabolical impieties againſt heaven, and the moſt ſhocking cruelties to men; the numbers I had drank to death, and ſecured in the ſervice of hell; the men I had ſent to the other world by combat at piſtol and ſword; and the women I had ruined, not only in this life, but perhaps, for evermore; the miſeries I had brought upon families, and the manifold afflictions I had been the author of for years after years,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0028500100:312"/>by night and by day;—all theſe offences I ſaw like the hand-writing on the wall, and in a horror and conſternation of mind, that words cannot deſcribe, lay a miſerable ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle for two nights and two days. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, perplexed, and confounded, I rolled from ſide to ſide, and condemned myſelf and my folly in the moſt doleful complaints; but dared not look up to a juſt Judge and offended God. No ſlumber for this time did approach my eyes; but in agonies I ſhook with a frightful violence, and thought every moment, that the demons my fancy had in view, were going to force my miſerable ſoul away to everlaſting inflictions, in the moſt diſmal cavern of hell. Spent, however, at laſt, I fell into a ſhort ſleep. I had half an hour's reſt, and in that ſlumber imagined, I heard a ſmall voice ſay,—<hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.

                           </p>
                           <p>Upon this I awaked, and found my pains were gone. To heaven I lift my eyes, and as the tears poured down my face, cried out
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0028500100:313"/>to God for mercy. <hi>O God be merciful to me a ſinner. Have mercy on me duſt and ſin, the vileſt of all ſinful creatures.

                              <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0028500100:314"/>When I had thus implored the mercy of the Almighty, in a torrent of tears, with ſtrong cryings, I found my heart quite eaſy, and my mind ſo filled with delights and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that I cannot deſcribe the ſtrange hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my condition: but how to ſecure this felicity was the queſtion. I was afraid of the world, and trembled when I thought of its temptations: beſide, the great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my paſt life made it neceſſary that I ſhould live in an extraordinary ſtate of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and by great mortification and piety, make what amends I could for ſinning againſt heaven in the moſt atrocious manner; and wilfully, for a long ſeries of years, breaking every law of the juſt and holy governor of the world. A change of mind, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon piety, were not enough for ſuch a wretch as I had been. I was unworthy of the innocent comforts of life. I ought to breathe in ſighs, and ſpeak in groans. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved then to be a <hi>reform</hi> indeed, and in this part of <hi>Stanemore</hi> mountains, which I was well acquainted with, ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my days, in the labours of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential piety.</p>
                           <p>As I had no relations living, I ſold what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates I had left, and gave almoſt the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney among the poor. With the little I kept, I bought what neceſſary things I ſhould want in my ſolitude; and with tools and ſeeds,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0028500100:315"/>ſome cloaths and linnen, a few books, and other little matters, retired to this ſpot in the year 1681. I had ſome working men from the next village, to build me the little hut I live in; to ſow my garden with every vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and put ſome fruit-trees in the ground; to cut me a pile of firing from the woody hills; and make my place as convenient as my intended life could require. All this was ſoon done, and then I was left alone; in the poſſeſſion of every thing I had a wiſh for in this world. It is now twenty years ſince my arrival here, and in all the time, I have not had one ſick or diſmal hour. My garden and my cottage employ me in agreeable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to furniſh my table with roots and fruits; which is what I moſtly live on; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing more but goats milk, and now and then a ſea-biſcuit; my drink being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſometimes a cup of meath of my own making.</p>
                           <p>When I am weary of working, I ſit down to ſtudy my <hi>Bible,</hi> and in that moſt perfect treaſure of ſaving knowledge, I find ſuch joys and ſatisfactions as make my life a ſcene of heavenly happineſs, and charm me into raptures the nearer I approach to the hour of my diſſolution. That will be a bleſſed hour. By the amazing mercy of God, vouchſafed through the Lord Jeſus, my crimſon ſins are pardoned; and when the voice of the Son of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0028500100:316"/>God, the thunder of the dreadful trumpet will awake all the dead, I ſhall have my part in the firſt reſurrection, and aſcend with the bleſſed to the eternal manſions of the ſky.—Adored be thy goodneſs, moſt glorious Eternal. Ineſtimable is thy love in the redemption of ſinners by the <hi>goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the <hi>holy Jeſus!</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fellow mortal,</hi> whoever thou art, into whoſe hands this paper cometh, take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and remember thy latter end. If, like me, thou haſt been betrayed by the <hi>demons</hi> into great impieties and preſumptuous ſins, an haſt been perſuaded to abdicate heaven, and its eternal hopes, in exchange for illicit gratifications of every kind, and the pleaſures of this world; then, like me, repent, and in tears and mortification, implore the mercy of heaven. Turn to the everlaſting Father of mercies, and the God of all comforts, after his own manner, with humility, ſorrow, and reſolutions of amendment, and in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, implore his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and forgiveneſs, and he will repent and turn unto thee. He will waſh you in the blood of Jeſus, and make you whiter than ſnow. When he ſees the ſinner a great way off in tears, faſting, and prayer, he will run unto him, and fall upon his neck and kiſs him. You will become the beloved of the Father, and be reinſtated in the favor of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0028500100:317"/>the greateſt and moſt glorious of immortal Beings. He will bleſs you here with that peace that paſſeth all underſtanding. He will bleſs you for ever hereafter with glory and honour in the kingdom he has prepared for the benevolent, the pure, and the honeſt. But if you continue to offend your Creator, and violate the laws of the God of heaven, then will you live expoſed to judgments in this world, and moſt certainly will depart in confuſion and miſery. The demons you obeyed will gather round the pale, the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the affrighted ghoſt of you, eager to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve your wretched ſpirit in their own hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and will drag it to their diſmal regions. And when all the monuments of human power, wealth and pride ſhall be overthrown; the earth itſelf be in a blaze, and the ſea turned into vapours, at the deſcent of the Son of God, to judge the vaſt congregation of the ſons of men, the amazing aſſembly of mortals, unheard of generations raiſed from the grave, to have all their actions tried; every condition everlaſtingly determined; then will you be placed in that diviſion which will call upon the rocks to hide them, and the hills to cover them from the face of the Judge; but in vain attempt to ſecret them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from an infinite eye, and an Almighty power. Then will the <hi>terrors</hi> of the <hi>goſpel</hi> ſtand in full force againſt thee, and in the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0028500100:318"/>dreadful ſentence pronounced againſt the <hi>guilty</hi> you muſt ſhare—<hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire.</hi> O dreadful doom! what a tremendous day to ſinners! and to ſee the righteous acquitted, and before your eyes aſcend in triumph and ſplendor into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of glory, to live the happy favourites of God and Chriſt for never-ending ages; while you are driven forward to the infernal priſon, and ſhut up in the habitations of eternal darkneſs and torments—the very thought of it, (if you will think ſeriouſly of it) is enough to curdle the blood, and wither in a moment every unlawful joy that ſin can produce in bloom and glory. The <hi>deſpair,</hi> the <hi>ſighs,</hi> the <hi>groans,</hi> the <hi>doleful ſhrieks,</hi> when the <hi>wicked</hi> are driven off to the <hi>regions of blackneſs and darkneſs for ever,</hi> are inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Think then. Think in time, my <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mortal,</hi> and <hi>profit by the blood of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Study his goſpel. Hear his miniſters. Regard the alarms of conſcience, and ſubmit to the influence of the</hi> holy Spirit.</p>
                           <p>And if your are not that monſter of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity I once was, before I obtained the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy, by a timely and ſevere repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet, as in heaven, ſo in hell, there are many manſions, and if you do not work out your ſalvation according to the <hi>terms</hi> of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> and make <hi>every law</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>rules</hi> of your behaviour—if you do not
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0028500100:319"/>act continually as related to God, to each other, and to another world, and ſeek firſt the kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, you will utterly diſqualify yourſelf for the rewards and happineſs of heaven, tho' your conduct may be far from meriting the moſt dreadful inflictions in another world. The <hi>gains of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>medling with any forbidden fruit,</hi> is a violation of the laws of God that muſt ruin you for ever; tho' the puniſhment for ſo doing cannot be equal to the torments prepared for the tyrant and oppreſſor, the murderer, the adulterer, the drunkard, and offenders in the higheſt crimes. We muſt ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well, in order to be ſaved. Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>promiſes</hi> and <hi>prayers at laſt,</hi> not according to <hi>legacies</hi> to be paid to the poor when we are dead, ſhall we be judged; but, as we have rectified the judgment and the will, made virtue the governor of the heart, and in all things ſought God's glory, not our own.

               <head>51. A reflexion on the bones of John Orton.</head>
               <p> This extraordinary paper ſurprized me very greatly, and when from reading it, I turned my eyes to the <hi>bones</hi> of <hi>John Orton,</hi> I could not help breaking out in the following reflection — And is this the once lively, gallant, drinking
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0028500100:320"/>
                  <hi>Jack Orton,</hi> who thought for forty years that he was made for no higher end than to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify every appetite, and paſs away time in a continual circle of vanity and pleaſure! <hi>Poor ſkeleton,</hi> what a miſerable ſpectacle art thou! Not the leaſt remain of activity and joy, of that ſprightlineſs and levity of mind, that jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund humour and frolic, which rendered thee the delight of the wild ſocieties of thy youthful time: Grim, ſtiff, and horrid, is the appearance now: vain mirth and luxury, licentious plays and ſports, can have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with theſe dry bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Death,</hi> what a change doſt thou make! The bulk of mankind are averſe to ſerious thought, and hearken to the paſſions more than to the dictates of reaſon and religion: To kill time, and baniſh reflection, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in a round of diſſipations, and revel in the freedom of vicious exceſſes: Their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is engroſſed by ſpectacle and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and fixed to follies and trifles: giddy and unthinking, looſe and voluptuous, they ſpend their precious hours in the gay ſcenes of diverſions, pomp and luxury; and as if the grave and a judgment to come, were a romance of former times, or things from which they are ſecured, never think of theſe important and momentous ſubjects: with minds bewitched by exorbitant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and faculties enervated and broken by
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0028500100:321"/>idle mirth and vanity, they paſs their every day away without any of that conſideration which becomes reaſonable beings, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deſigned for a ſtate of immortality: bu at laſt, you appear, and in a moment turn delight and admiration, into averſion and horror: ſtrength, wealth, and charms, you inſtantly reduce to weakneſs, poverty, and deformity, in the firſt place; and then, to a ſkeleton, like the bones before me.</p>
               <p>Nor is this the worſt of the great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. When death approaches, the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſenſe immediately fail, and paſt tranſactions, in every circumſtance of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, crowd into the mind: conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches loudly, the heart condemns, and the ſick tremble at the apprehenſions of a vengeance they laughed at in the days of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and the midnight hours of the ball: as they come near the black valley, they ſee the realities of a future ſtate; and agonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſe their ſouls: terrors till then unknown enter their breaſts; and, in anxieties that are incapable of being uttered, and expectations the moſt torturing, on a review of life, they paſs from the plains of time into the ocean of eternity. Here lies the frame, like the <hi>dry bones</hi> before me; but, the ſoul is gone to the ſeſſions of righteouſneſs; and perhaps, the dreadful ſentence of the divine juſtice is pronounced on it. This is a tremendous
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0028500100:322"/>affair, that calls for timely and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. <hi>Eternity! Eternal miſery! They that have done evil, to come forth unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of damnation!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will take thy advice then, thou <hi>glorious penitent, John Orton;</hi> and ſince it is in my power to come forth unto the reſurrection of life, and obtain <hi>immortality, honour,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> with the <hi>righteous,</hi> in the <hi>kingdom of their father,</hi> I will open the <hi>reforming goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> night and morning, and by its heavenly directions regulate my conduct. I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make a wiſe and ſerious prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for death and judgment. To the beſt of my power, I will provide for that <hi>day,</hi> when the <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>charities</hi> of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous will be brought forth as their <hi>memorials</hi> before the <hi>tribunal</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This — this is the thing to be minded. The brighteſt ſcenes of worldly proſperity, and grandeur, are contemptible, when they do not accord with virtue and piety. Death, in a few years, blends the prince and the meaneſt ſubject, the conqueror and the ſlave, the ſtateſman, the warrior, and the moſt inſignificant, in one promiſcuous ruin; and the ſchemes, the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the intereſts, which have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the chief attention of the world, are brought to nothing, and appear, too often, ridiculous: but righteouſneſs is unchangeably
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0028500100:323"/>glorious, and in the univerſal ruin, receives no detriment: when all human power and policy will be extinct; <hi>concealed piety</hi> and <hi>perſecuted virtue,</hi> will again appear, and be <hi>owned as His by the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when he maketh up his jewels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will love thee therefore, O Lord, my ſtrength; yea, I will love thee: and it ever ſhall be my heart's deſire, that my ſoul may behold by faith in its ſelf, as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, able and ready to change it into the ſame image from glory to glory, reflected upon, and conveyed to it by the Spirit of the Lord. May my portion here be this bleſſed transforming union, that I may be made partaker of the divine nature, by impreſſions from it

               <p>Such was the <hi>ſoliloquy</hi> I ſpoke,  as I gazed on the <hi>ſkeleton</hi> of <hi>John Orton;</hi> and juſt as I had ended, the boys brought in the wild turkey, which they had very ingeniouſly roaſted, and with ſome of Mrs. <hi>Burcot</hi>'s fine ale and bread, I had an excellent ſupper. The bones of the <hi>penitent Orton</hi> I removed to a hole I had ordered my lad to dig for them; the ſkull excepted, which I kept, and ſtill keep on my table, for a <hi>memento mori;</hi> and that I may never forget the good leſſon, which the percipient who once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in it, had given. It is often the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my meditation. When I am alone of an evening, in my cloſet, which is often my caſe, I have the <hi>ſkull</hi> of <hi>John Orton</hi> before me, and as I ſmoak a philoſophic pipe, with my eyes faſtened on it, I learn more from the <hi>ſolemn object,</hi> than I could from the moſt philoſophical and laboured ſpeculations. What a wild and hot head once: how cold and ſtill now; poor ſkull, I ſay: and what was the end of all thy daring frolics and gambols — thy licentiouſneſs and impiety? — A ſevere and bitter repentance. In <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>goodneſs John Orton</hi> found at laſt that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0028500100:327"/>happineſs the world could not give him. There is no real felicity for man, but in reforming all his errors and vices, and entring upon a ſtrict and conſtant courſe of virtue. This only makes life comfortable; renders death ſerene and peaceful; and ſecures eternal joy and bleſſedneſs hereafter. Such are the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I extract from the <hi>ſkull</hi> of <hi>John Orton.</hi>

               <head>53. An inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the goods of John Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</head>
               <p> When I had ſupped, I went about, to ſee what things Mr. <hi>Orton</hi> had left behind him in his little cottage, and I found a field bed-ſtead large enough for two, with a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs, ſilk blankets, quilt, and cotton cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; two oak ſtools, and a ſtrong ſquare table of the ſame wood. An oak ſettee, on which his bones lay; a ſilver lamp to burn oil in; a tinder-box and matches; a caſe of razors; ſix handſome knives and forks in a caſe; half a dozen china plates, two china diſhes; and two pint mugs of the ſame ware; half a dozen drinking-glaſſes, a large copper kettle, a braſs ſkillet, two ſilver ſpoons, and a ſilver ladle; in a cheſt were cloaths and linnen, ſhoes and ſtockings, and various uſeful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There were pens, ink, and paper in a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-deſk, and half a ſcore guineas; and on a ſhelf over it, a dozen good books; three of which were, a large <hi>Engliſh</hi> bible, <hi>Thomas a Kempis,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s hiſtory of the world: under the ſhelf hung a plain gold watch, and a large ring ſun-dial. In a dark
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0028500100:328"/>cloſet, I found a box of ſea-biſkets, many flaſks of oil for eating, and jars of it for the lamp; honey, ſalt, and vinegar; four dozen of quart bottles of meath, and two ſtone bottles, that held three gallons each, full of brandy: this I ſuppoſe was againſt the days of weakneſs or ſickneſs. He had not uſed a pint of this liquor.</p>
               <p>Having found theſe things within doors, I proceeded from the houſe to the garden, which lay at a ſmall diſtance from the little thatched manſion, and contained about four acres; it had been very beautifully laid out, and filled with the beſt fruit-trees, and all the vegetables: but it was run to ruin and high weeds, and ſhewed that its owner had been long dead. I ſuppoſe he died ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the date of his paper; for, I obſerved, that many prior dates had been ſtruck out; and had he lived after the year 1701, he would, in all probability, have razed that likewiſe, and ſet down 1702. Some ſudden ſickneſs muſt have ſeized him; and perhaps, when he found himſelf ſinking, he laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out naked on the wooden couch where I found his <hi>ſkeleton.</hi> I can no otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his having no kind of covering over him. As to his bones being ſo clean, that to be ſure was performed by the ants. I took notice of many neſts here of the larger ants, in holes under the roots of great trees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0028500100:329"/>That the <hi>piſmires</hi> are the beſt <hi>preparers</hi> of a <hi>ſkeleton</hi> is not only certain from the account the miſſionaries give of the coming on of the <hi>ants</hi> in <hi>Pegu;</hi> when in one night's time, the vaſt ſwarms of them that approach, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce every human creature they can faſten on to clean bones; which makes the people ſet fire to their habitations, when they have notice given them by a kind of ſmall mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key they keep for the purpoſe of the motion of this terrible enemy: but it is plain from what I have often experimented.</p>
               <p>When I want to make a ſkeleton of any ſmall animal, I put the dead creature in a box with holes in it among the ants, in their habitations, or neſts, or in ſuch parts of the houſe as a whole tribe will often march to, through ſeveral rooms, in one track or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain road, to eat ſugar or ſweatmeats they have diſcovered, and then in two or three days, they will perform what the fineſt knife cannot execute. The big ants which are larger than a common houſe fly, and are ſeldom leſs than ſix thouſand in a neſt, will clear the bones of a rat in half a night's time.</p>
               <p>There was a pretty little wooden ſummer-houſe in the centre of the garden, and in it had been in pots ſome curious plants and flowers. Here were various tools, and many inſtruments of gardening. It appeared from
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0028500100:330"/>them, and the great variety of things in the ground, that Mr. <hi>Orton</hi> muſt have uſed himſelf to hard labour, and found great pleaſure in his improvements and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There was a deal of art and ingenuity to be traced in the wild wilderneſs the garden was grown into. It was plain from a book, called the <hi>Carthuſian gardener,</hi> which lay on a table in the ſummer-houſe, that he had made that buſineſs his ſtudy. Round this ſummer-houſe were the remains of many hives on benches, but the bees were all gone, and the ſtock ruined.</p>

               <p>All theſe things, and the place,  ſet me a thinking, and ſoon ſuggeſted to my fancy, that in my condition, I could not do better than ſucceed Mr. <hi>Orton</hi> on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes; but, without turning hermit. Here is (I ſaid) a pretty ſmall thatched manſion, that might eaſily be enlarged, if more rooms were wanting; and a garden, which labour would ſoon reſtore to its uſefulneſs and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make it produce the beſt vegetables in plenty. Here is fiſh in the waters, fowl of every kind, and deer on the mountains. Here are goats in great herds, for milk, for kids, and when cut, for excellent veniſon. Here is the fineſt water, and by getting bees, as Mr. <hi>Orton</hi> had, meath may be made that will be equal to the beſt foreign wine. As to the ſituation, it is moſt delightful. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0028500100:331"/>can be more charming than theſe ſhores and breaking waters, the rocky precipices and the woody hills, which ſurround this little region. What then ſhould hinder but that I here ſit down, and put an end to my adventures; as the few things that are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be had at the next town, and a ſtock for years be in a few days ſecured? The man I am looking for may never be found; and if I ſhould meet with him, his circumſtances and temper may be changed: then, as to the world, I know not how to deal in any kind of buſineſs; and to live on the ſmall fortune in my poſſeſſion, muſt reduce me to poverty very ſoon. Here then it is good for me to reſide, and make myſelf as happy as I can, if it be not in my power to be as happy as I would. I have two lads with me, who are active, uſeful young men, willing to work, and pleaſed to ſtay where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am; and if I can commence a <hi>matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> relation with ſome ſenſible, good-humoured, dear delightful girl of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and perſuade her to be the chearful partner of my ſtill life, <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> will create the higheſt ſcenes of felicity, and we ſhall live as it were in the ſuburbs of heaven. My lads too may pick up among the hills, upon <hi>ſcripture principles,</hi> two bouncing females: and a ſtate will in a little time be formed. This is fine. For
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0028500100:332"/>once in my life I am fortunate. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, this partner I want in my ſolitude could be Miſs <hi>Melmoth,</hi> one of the wiſeſt and moſt diſcreet of women; a thinking bloom, and good-humour itſelf in a human figure; then indeed I muſt be happy in this ſilent, romantic ſtation. This ſpot of earth would then have all the felicities. — Reſolved. <hi>Concluſum eſt contra Manicheos,</hi> ſaid the great <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> and with a thump of his fiſt, he cracked the table.</p>

               <p>Thus was my head employed,  while I ſmoaked a pipe after ſupper, and I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to return to <hi>Orton's manſion,</hi> after I had found a way out of <hi>Stanemore:</hi> but the previous queſtion was, how I ſhould get out of the place I was in, without going back, as there appeared no paſſage onwards. I tried every angle the next morning, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and in vain attempted ſome hills that were too ſteep for the horſes. Down then again I went to the bottom of the black and narrow glin afore-mentioned, and with lights obſerved the rumbling deep river. It appeared more frightful than the firſt time I ſaw it, and there was no venturing into it. This troubled me not a little, as the water was not above eight yards broad, and there was an aſcending glin on the other ſide of it, that appeared to riſe into a fine woody coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It was not half the length of that we
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0028500100:333"/>had deſcended, nor near ſo ſteep; it began to widen at the diſtance of a hundred yards from the water, ſo as to ſhew, at the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, a fine plain encompaſſed with a ſweep of foreſt. We could ſee the ſun ſhining there. The view in contraſt was quite charming.</p>
               <p>For ſome time I ſtood in this perplexed condition by the water-ſide, and could not tell what to do, when one of the lads came running to me, to let me know, that as he carefully examined the ſides of the glin we came down, he diſcovered to the left, about fourſcore yards above the river, a paſs wide enough for one horſe to go through, and he believed it was a way out. This was reviving news, and upon going into it, I found that it went ſtraight on among the mountains, like a rent, or open crack, for three hundred yards, and then turned to the left for about fifty more, when it winded a little, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to extend wider and wider every yard, till it brought us by ſeveral turnings to the beginning of a fine valley, where we again found the river we had ſeen in the bottom of the deep glin, and perceived that it ended in a great water, and went off in ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean way. The mountains were almoſt cloſe to this fine water, on either hand, for near half a mile, and made a delightful rural
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0028500100:334"/>ſcene. We could ſee the river, as we looked up it, come tumbling on for a great way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſteep rocky precipices; and the broad bright lake it formed between vaſt frowning mountains, with wood and lawns in it, at the end of the vale, were altogether a view moſt charming. This made me more highly value <hi>Orton-Lodge.</hi>

                           <p>The kingdom of Tunis in the weſt of Barbary in Aſric, was once the celebrated republic of Carthage. The city of Carthage was about 4 miles from the ſpot the city of Tunis now ſtands on. Many ruins of it are ſtill remaining. This glorious city, that was 23 miles round, and built near 100 years before Rome, was taken and utterly raſed by young Africanus, that is, Scipio Aemilianus, before Chriſt 146 years. It had diſputed with Rome for the empire of the world, for the ſpace of 118 years. The moſt beautiful village in the world, called Marſa, now ſtands in the weſtern point of antient Carthage, and from thence it is a fine walk to Dido's Cave under Cape-Bonn.</p>

, that I think we need not doubt of its being the cave into which the gallant <hi>Aeneas</hi> led the gracious queen: but that it ever was a quarry, and that pillars were made by the workmen to ſupport the roof, as Dr. <hi>Shaw</hi> ſays, does not ſeem to be the caſe. The whole grot, which goes in 36 fathoms under the hill, its arches, and pillars were undoubtedly by the hand of nature; like many others I have ſeen. So it appeared to me. I could not ſee the leaſt ſign of a labouring hand in this cave.</p>

At the upper end of it, there is a grand ſeat, arched into the ſtone, and near it a falling-ſpring of freſh water drops into a ciſtern it has made. The ruſhing tides have made good ſeats in the ſides of the rock, and from them you have a view of the channel, which is ſeven leagues. Every ſhip that ſail to and from Briſtol, is ſeen, and the mountains of Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire bound the proſpect that way. The cliff over the cave is almoſt double the height of the grot, and to the very edge of the precipice, the cattle come to graze, to avoid the inſects, who will not approach the ſea-breezes. The whole is a charming ſcene.</p>

                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0028500100:337"/>The <hi>cave</hi> in <hi>Stanemore</hi> is in the bottom of a perpendicular mountain of a vaſt height, the eaſt ſide of the lake, and four yards from the ſhoar. The entrance is a grand ſweep, high and broad as the grot, that is, in breadth 52 feet, in height 59. It is an hundred and forty ſeven feet long. The ſtone of it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beautiful; of a yellow and reddiſh colour, bright and glittering, and beautifully variegated with arched and undulated veins of various tinges. I broke off a piece of it, and found it a congeries of plates of ſpar, ſtained with a fine mixture of colours. It is a ſpecies of the <hi>alabaſter,</hi> called <hi>Marmor Onychites,</hi> on account of its tabulated zones, reſembling thoſe of the <hi>Onyx,</hi> and is very little inferior to the <hi>Aegyptian alabaſter.</hi> This <hi>Stanemore ſtone</hi> is far beyond the <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Derbyſhire alabaſter.</hi> The caverns there are but incruſted with a ſparry ſubſtance, as I have found upon various examinations; and,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0028500100:338"/>as is evident to every eye that ſees the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men making the elegant <hi>vaſes</hi> and <hi>chimney-columns</hi> we have of the alabaſter of thoſe counties: whereas in <hi>Stanemore,</hi> this alabaſter conſiſts of <hi>ſtrata</hi> of <hi>ſparry ſubſtance,</hi> tho' ſomewhat coarſer than this kind of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſtone.</p>
               <p>The top of the cave is a bold arch, finiſhed beyond all that art could do, and the floor as ſmooth as it is poſſible to make the ſtone. At the far end of the <hi>grot,</hi> there are a dozen rows of ſeats like benches, that riſe one above another. The uppermoſt will hold but two people: on each of the others a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen may ſit with eaſe: they make the place look as if it was the aſſembly room, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil chamber of the <hi>water-nymphs.</hi> There was no water dropping from the roof of this cave; but in a thouſand places, where moſs had agreeably covered the walls, it crept through the ſides, and formed ſtreams that ran ſofyly over the ground, and weared it ſmooth. It brought to my remembrance ſome very poetical lines in <hi>Lucretius:</hi>

               <p>Such was the delightful ſpot I at laſt diſcovered, when I thought I was come to the ne plus ultra, that is, had gone on till I could go no farther; and now ſeeing how my way lay, I departed from <hi>Orton-Lodge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the next morning, leaving my lad <hi>O Fin</hi> to keep poſſeſſion of the place till I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <note place="margin">1725. June 19. the 7th day ſince I left Jack Price.</note> and with the other boy went thro' the lawns in the wood I have mentioned at the end of the vale. This brought me to a range of mountains moſt frightful to behold, and to the top of them, with great toil, we made a ſhift to climb, and from thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended through many perils to a bottom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hills we had come down, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0028500100:340"/>ſome mountains that ſtood at a ſmall diſtance from them. This low ground trended <hi>north</hi> and <hi>north-weſt</hi> for an hour, and then turned <hi>north-eaſt</hi> for three hours more, a very bad way; ſtony and wet, and ſome ſtiff pieces of road: but the bottoms brought us at laſt into a large and ſpacious plain, that was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with hills, whoſe tops and ſides were covered with antient trees and lofty groves, and ſome mountains whoſe heads were above the clouds. Flowers and clover, and other herbs, adorned the ground, and it was watered with many never-drying ſtreams. The plain ſeemed a vaſt amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre, by nature formed; and variety and diſpoſition refreſhed the eyes whatever way they turned.</p>
               <p>In the very center of this ground, I found a houſe and gardens that charmed me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much. The manſion had a ruſticity and wildneſs in its aſpect, beyond any thing I had ſeen, and looked like a maſs of materials jumbled together without order or deſign. There was no appearance of rule in any part, and where a kind of proportion was to be ſeen, it ſeemed as a ſtart into truth, by the inadvertent head of blind chance. It was the moſt gothick, whimſical, four-fronted thing, without, that ever my eyes beheld; and within, the moſt convenient, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dwelling I have ſeen.</p>

There is no more rule obſerved in them, than in the houſe; but the plantations of trees, and plots of flowers, the raiſed hills, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial vallies, the ſtreams that water theſe vales, and the large pieces of water, and lakes, they have brought in, and formed, are inexpreſſibly charming and fine. Wild and natural they ſeem, and are a beautiful imitation of the moſt beautiful ſcenes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The wilderneſs, the openings, the parterres, the gardens, the ſtreams, the lakes, the caſcades, the valleys and the riſing grounds, in the moſt various diſpoſition, and as if art had little, or no hand in the deſigns, have an admirable effect upon the eye.</p>
               <p>The paſſages from valley to valley, between the hills they have made, are not by formal ſtraight walks, but by windings in various ways, which are decorated with little grotto's,and diverſified in the manner of laying out the ground: the ſtreams and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals ſometimes ſerpent, and ſometimes ſpread away. Rocks artfully placed, ſeem to puſh the waters off, and on the banks are ſeeming wild productions of flowers. As the hills and riſings are ſprinkled with flowery trees,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0028500100:342"/>ſo are theſe banks with all the ſweets that grow. Small boats are on the running ſtreams, and over them in many places, are winding bridges of wood, moſt ingeniouſly and finely made.

               <p> When I came up to this ſeat, which the owners of it call <hi>Ulubrae,</hi> ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were in the gardens, ſaw me, and ſaved me the trouble of aſking admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by inviting me in with the greateſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; but they ſeemed under a vaſt ſurprize at my arrival; and much more ſo, when I gave them an account of the way I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled. It appeared almoſt incredible. They had not a notion of ſuch a journey. They told me I was in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> now, and had been ſo, when I aſcended the high mountains that are ſome miles behind the hills that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round their houſe; but they did not imagine there was any travelling over thoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the alps upon alps beyond them, to <hi>Brugh under Stanemore.</hi> The way (they ſaid) was very bad from their houſe to <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſton,</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:0028500100:343"/>or <hi>Bowes,</hi> on account of hills, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and wet bottoms; it was worſe to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel <hi>northward</hi> to <hi>Biſhoprick;</hi> and ſcarce paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>north eaſt</hi> to <hi>Cumberland:</hi>—What then muſt it be to journey as I had done over the <hi>northern fells</hi> of <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> and the bad part of <hi>Yorkſhire-Stanemore</hi> I had paſſed.</p>
               <p>It was a terrible way (I replied), and what I often deſpaired of coming through, even at the hazard of my life. Frequently we were locked in by chains of precipices, and thought we ſhould never find a paſs: ſome of the mountains were ſo ſteep, that it was with the greateſt difficulty we could lead the horſes up and down them: and many rivers were ſo rapid, and rocky at bottom, that we were often in danger of being loſt: beſide, if fortune had not conducted us to the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of people we little expected to find, we might have periſhed for want of food, as my ſervant could not bring from <hi>Brugh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſufficient for ſo long and uncertain a way. All theſe difficulties I ſaw very ſoon; in leſs than a day's ride to the <hi>north</hi> from the <hi>Bell</hi> on the <hi>ſouthern-edge</hi> of <hi>Stanemore;</hi> a little lone public-houſe, that lies half way the turnpike-road, on the left hand, as the traveller goes from <hi>Bowes</hi> to <hi>Brugh, Penrith,</hi> and <hi>Carliſle:</hi> but friendſhip and curioſity were too many for all the obſtacles in the way; and in hopes of finding a beloved
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0028500100:344"/>friend, who lives ſomewhere towards the northern edge of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> or <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> or on the neighbouring confines of <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> or <hi>Cumberland;</hi> and that I might ſee a part of England, which even the borderers on it are ſtrangers to, and of which <hi>Camden</hi> had not an idea

When I aſked <hi>Railton,</hi> the quaker, a very knowing man, who keeps the <hi>George</hi> at <hi>Bowes,</hi> what ſort of a country <hi>Stanemore</hi> was?

; I went on, and have had ſucceſs thus far. The journey has been worth my pains. I have beheld the moſt delightful ſcenes, and met with very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary things: and ſhould I find my friend at laſt, my labours will be highly rewarded indeed.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen I was talking to, ſeemed to wonder very much at me and my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and as the reſt of the ſociety by this time came into the parlour, they introduced me to them, and then related what I had
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0028500100:345"/>ſaid. They all allowed it was very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and requeſted I would oblige them with ſome particulars that occurred. I did immediately. I told them, among other things, of my reception at <hi>Burcot-Lodge</hi>—and the <hi>ſkeleton</hi> of <hi>John Orton</hi> which I found in the cottage on the ſide of a woody hill: I let them know the goods and conveniencies I ſaw there, and that I was ſo pleaſed with the beauties of the place, the little manſion, the once fine gardens, and the uſeful things on the premiſſes, that I intended to return to it, and make it my ſummer retreat: that I had left a man there to that purpoſe, who was at work in the garden, and expected to be back in a month's time, with ſuch things as were wanting to make it an agreeable and comfortable little country-houſe.</p>
               <p>The philoſophers wondered not a little at what they heard. If they were ſurprized at ſeeing me as a traveller in ſuch a place, they were much more aſtoniſhed at my relation. They could not enough admire Mrs. <hi>Burcot</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Fletcher.</hi> The hiſtory of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent <hi>Orton,</hi> they thought very ſtrange. They told me they were glad I had a thought of making <hi>Orton-Lodge</hi> a ſummer retreat, and hoped it would occaſion my calling upon them many times: that I ſhould always be heartily welcome to their houſe, and might with leſs difficulty go backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0028500100:346"/>as their lodge was at my ſervice, whenever I was pleaſed to do them the favor to call. This was civil, and I returned them the thanks they deſerved.</p>
               <p>Here dinner was brought in, and with theſe gentlemen I ſat down to ſeveral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſhes. There was the beſt of every kind of meat and drink, and it was ſerved up in the moſt elegant manner: their wine in particular was old and generous, and they gave it freely. We took a chearful glaſs after dinner, and laughed a couple of hours away in a delightful manner. They were quite polite, friendly and obliging; and I ſoon found, in converſing with them, that they were men of great reading, and greater abilities. Philoſophy had not ſaddened their tempers. They were as lively companions, as they were wiſe and learned men.</p>
               <p>Theſe gentlemen are twenty in number, men of fortune, who had agreed to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, on the plan of a college deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> in his letter to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0028500100:347"/>pay their ſervants, keep their horſes, and purchaſe every thing the ſociety requires.

               <p> In one of their beſt double reflecting optical inſtruments, I had a better view of the variety and true mixture of colours than ever I ſaw before. The origins and mixtures were finely viſible. In a common green rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, the yellow, the light red and a blue, appeared diſtinct and very plain: the lively green was a yellow and blue: in a ſea green, more blue than yellow: the yellow was a light red and a pellucid white: All the <hi>phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of colours were here to be found out.</p>

Very different, indeed, are the things finiſhed by human art, from the things finiſhed by the hand of nature.

The <hi>flea</hi> appeared firſt in the box, <note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a flea.</note>

and as he was magnified very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he looked like a locuſt without wings; with a roundiſh body, that is obtuſe at the end, and the breaſt covered with an armature of a triangular figure; the head ſmall in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its body, but the eyes large, red, and very fierce; his ſix legs were long, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt, and made for leaping; the antennae ſhort, but firm and ſharp; its tail was ſcaly, and full of ſtings, and its mouth pointed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to active pincers: his colour was a deep pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

               <p> The firſt that was brought on the ſtage was the <hi>flea,</hi> and to ſhew us what an active one he was, he ſprung and bounced at a ſtrange rate: the velocity of his motions in leaping, were aſtoniſhing; and ſometimes, he would tumble over and over in a wanton way: but the moment the <hi>louſe</hi> appeared, he ſtood ſtock ſtill, gathered himſelf up, and fixed his flaſhing eyes on his foe. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>louſe</hi> did with a frown for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and then crouching down, began very ſoftly to move towards him, when the flea gave a leap on his enemy, and with his dangerous tail and pinching mouth, began the battle with great fury: but the louſe ſoon made him quit his hold, by hurting him with his claws, and wounding him with his ſharp ſnout. This made the flea ſkip to the other ſide of the box, and they both kept at a diſtance for near a minute, looking with great indignation at each other, and offering ſeveral times to advance. The louſe did it at laſt in a race, and then the flea flew at him, which produced a battle as terrible as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0028500100:354"/>ever was fought by two wild beaſts. Every part of their bodies were in moſt violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſometimes the flea was uppermoſt, but more frequently the louſe. They did bite, and thruſt, and claw one another moſt furiouſly, and the conſequence of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful engagement was, that the flea expired, and the louſe remained victor in the box: but he was ſo much wounded, that he could ſcarce walk.—This battle was to me a very ſurprizing thing, as each of them was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the ſize of two feet: But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſpecs or atoms of animated matter they were, it was aſtoniſhing to reflexion to behold the amazing mechaniſm of theſe two minute things, which appeared in their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions during the fray. It was ſtill more ſtrange to ſee the averſion theſe ſmall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had to each other, the paſſions that worked in their little breaſts, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they ſhewed in their endeavours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another. It is indeed a wonderful affair: nor was it the leaſt part of my admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſee through the extraordinary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parencies of the louſe, the violent circulation of the blood in its heart. This was as plane to my eye, as red liquor forced by a pump in ſeveral experiments through circulating glaſs pipes.—As to the dead flea, it was opened, and by the <hi>camera obſcura</hi> or <hi>ſolar</hi> microſcope, (which magnifies the picture of

               <p>In oppoſition to this amphibious creature, which walks on the mud at the bottom of ſtanding waters, as well as on the banks, the ſilvery-green bodied ſpider was put into the box, which is one of the claſs that lives in the woods, where it ſquats down on the branches of trees, and throws four of its legs forward, and four backward, extending them ſtraight along the bough; but the great water aranea, with his terrible wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, the black forceps, in a minute deſtroyed

With admiration I beheld the magnified objects — the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful arrangement of the inteſtines of a flea — the motion and ebullition of the blood of a louſe — their forms — the various ſpiders, ſo aſtoniſhingly framed — the gnat, that elephant in ſo ſmall a miniature — the amazing form of the ant — the aſtoniſhing claws and beautiful wings of a fly; the bones, nerves, arteries, veins, and moving blood in this very minute animal — the wonderful bee, its claws, its colours, and diſtinct rows of teeth, with which it ſips the flowers, and carries the honey home in its ſtomach, but brings the wax externally on its thighs — and a thouſand other things which manifeſt a Creator.

To deſcribe thoſe fine things would require a volume. Among the books, I ſaw the editions of the old authors, by the famous printers of the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries; editions greatly prized and ſought after by moſt of the learned; but theſe gentlemen did not value them ſo much as the editions of the claſſicks, that have been publiſhed within this laſt century; eſpecially the quarto edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions done in Holland.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0028500100:362"/>


well for our church, if our biſhops were obliged to leave the court, the parliament, and their politicks, and then ſpend their lives in labouring in the vineyard of Chriſt, in their ſeveral dioceſes. What have prieſts to do with baronies and acts of ſtate; men that ought above all other men to be content with food and raiment, and to withdraw themſelves from the world, that by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued converſation with God, and attention only to the ſacred preſcriptions of the goſpel, they might appear repleniſhed with that divine power and virtue, which by prayer, and all the exerciſes of piety and penitence, they had implored; and by their examples and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, brighten and inflame the people with the love of God, and improve the good in goodneſs, and correct and reform the wicked. This would be acting like biſhops indeed. The holineſs of our prelates lives, and their fervor in teaching mankind the truths of Jeſus Chriſt, would ſoon advance the cauſe of their maſter. They would bring the people to conform to the will of the Lord, and cauſe the learned to purifie the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of genius; that pride and vanity, that curioſity and ſelf-love which are incompatible with an accompliſhed purity of heart. But as to <hi>Charles the Firſt</hi> of bleſſed memory, certain I am, that whatever Dean Delany may think of him, this prince did really contend for the cardinal maxims of the civil law, and died, not for true religion, (as this doctor ſays) but to advance the civil laws above the conſtitution and laws of Britain, and thereby acquire an abſolute dominion. <hi>Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem.</hi> It appears from matters of fact, that his <hi>pleaſure</hi> was to be the <hi>law.</hi> In him was to reſide the ſole power of impoſing taxes on the people. <hi>This power,</hi> and other powers contrary to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental form of this government; this king of bleſſed

                     <p>Inſtead then of the fine laboured reaſons offered by Dr. Delaney to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland, to account for the way of providence in the tragical death of this king, he might have ſaid — That whereas this prince had <hi>departed</hi> from the known laws of the land to an <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> power, and not only the <hi>preſſures</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> of the people, under this method of governing, were innumerable; but the <hi>fundamental form</hi> and <hi>original conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> (on which the proteſtant religion and the liberty of Europe depend) was in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubverted, and for ever deſtroyed, therefore did Providence deliver up this king into the hands of wicked men, who had uſurped the adminiſtration of affairs, that the mortification in the conſtitution might be cured by the death of this deſtroying prince; and the violence of his exit remain a monument in terrorem to all future kings of England; to have a care how they offer to make any alteration or change in the original form of government; for <hi>violations</hi> of the <hi>conſtitution</hi> had brought <hi>Charles the Firſt</hi> to the <hi>block.</hi> This had been a reaſonable account of that ſad affair.

It is to be lamented that we have but 16 of them. They go no farther than to the 34th year of Jeſus Chriſt, and relate principally to Baronius's bad explication of ſcripture.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay <hi>with the ſame hand,</hi> becauſe the 12th article of the edict ſigned by this cruel and perfidious prince, in the 43d year of his reign, is as follows:—12. And furthermore, Thoſe of the ſaid pretended reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, till ſuch time as it ſhall pleaſe God to illuminate them, may abide in the towns, and places of our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, countries and lands of our dominion, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their traffick, and enjoy their goods, without being moleſted or hindered, on account of the ſaid pretended reformed religion, provided they do not aſſemble to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it, etc.—This was a monſtrous cheat and perfidiouſneſs, to deceive and enſnare his poor ſubjects. Something might be ſaid for the <hi>edict of revocation,</hi> if <hi>Lewis</hi> had declared, that to quell the agitations of his conſcience, he muſt revoke the <hi>edict of Nantes,</hi> tho'


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0028500100:372"/>


he had ſworn to the obſervation of it; but he allowed a certain time to his proteſtant ſubjects, after which they muſt either turn catholicks, or quit the kingdom, with their families and effects, or elſe they ſhould be expoſed to ſuch and ſuch treatment.—This had been plain and honeſt dealing, tho' an arbitrary proceeding: but to give it under his hand to his ſubjects, that they might ſtay and <hi>continue their traffick, enjoy their goods without being moleſted, or hindered on account of their religion; and at the ſame time leave them to the mercy of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons:</hi>—Was not this an heinous act? Had he been guilty of this ſingle one only, (ſays <hi>Laval,</hi> in his excellent hiſtory of the Reformation of France, vol. 6.) it would have imprinted ſuch a ſpot on his reputation, that all the waters of the <hi>Seine</hi> were not ſufficient to waſh it away.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>edict of Nantz</hi> was granted to the <hi>reformed</hi> by <hi>Henry the</hi> 4th, in the 9th year of his reign, of grace 1598.</p>

               <p>Many other extraordinary books and manuſcripts I ſaw in this library, and a great number of fine curioſities; but I can only mention one particular more. Engraven on a beautiful <hi>Cornelian,</hi> I ſaw the <hi>Roman god of bounds,</hi> with theſe words, <hi>Concedo nulli:</hi> and one of the gentlemen aſked me, what I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the meaning of this deſign? The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem (I anſwered) was a very juſt one, and in my opinion meant, that truth muſt never be given up. That (it was replied) was not the meaning of it, tho' my thought was not unjuſt. The deſign is to put one in mind of death, of which <hi>terminus</hi> is the juſteſt
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0028500100:377"/>emblem; and he ſays, <hi>Concedo nulli,</hi> I favour none, I ſuffer none to paſs the limit. There is (continued the gentleman) a little curious hiſtory depends on this. Here is a gold me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallion, on one ſide of which you ſee the image of the great <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and on the other this fancy; which he always wore in a ring, and from thence I had the medallion ſtruck. Eraſmus aſked the famous <hi>Carvajal,</hi> the Spaniſh cordelier, (juſt as I did you) what the meaning of this ring was. <hi>Carvajal,</hi> who had had ſome conteſts with <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and hated him greatly, ſaid it owed its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without all peradventure, to the <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and meant, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yield, right or wrong, to any one in the republic of letters. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> anſwered, that his explication was quite wrong, and that, on the contrary, he uſed the device, to kill his pride, and put him in mind of death, which ſuffers not the greateſt men to paſs the ſhort limit of time allotted them. This pleaſed me much, and I reſolved to get the fancy on a cornelian for a ſeal.</p>

               <p> Another extraordinary thing theſe gentlemen ſhewed me was a hole leading to ſome wonderful caverns in the ſide of a mountain, about a mile to the north of their houſe. It reſembles at the entrance, <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>park-hole,</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>Penpark-hole</hi> you are let down by ropes fixed at the top of the pit, four fathom perpendicular, and then deſcend three fathom more, in an oblique way, between two rocks, which brings you to a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tunnel, 39 yards down, into which you deſcend by ropes, and land in a ſpacious chamber, that is 75 yards in length, 41 in breadth, and 19 yards high, from the margin of a great water, at the north end of it, to the roof. This water is 27 yards in length, 12 in breadth, and generally 16 deep. It is ſweet, bright, and good drink. It riſes ſometimes ſeveral feet, and at other times ſinks two feet below its uſual depth. The torches always burn clear in this chamber, nor is the air in the leaſt offenſive, tho' 59 yards from the ſurface of the earth, and ſeparated from the day by ſuch deep tunnels, and an oblique deſcent between them. The great tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is about 3 yards wide, and in the ſouth ſide of it 30 yards down, 9 yards before you come to the opening of the chamber, or cavity below, is a paſſage 32 yards in length, 3 and a half high, and 3 yards broad. It is the habitation of bats, and towards the end of it, a ſloping hole goes to ſome other place. This paſſage, and the tunnels, and the chamber below, is all irregular work.</p>

, within three miles of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>Penpark-hole</hi> was once a lead ore pit, and one is let down by ropes through two tunnels, to the chamber; whereas the entrance of the place I am ſpeaking of is the work of nature, a ſteep and narrow deſcent of twenty-three yards, which I went down by having a rope under my arm, and ſetting my hands and feet againſt the ſides of the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0028500100:379"/>paſſage, till I came to a flat rough rock, which opened 2 yards and a half one way, and 4 yards the other way. This little cavern was two yards high. We went from it into a more eaſy ſloping way, which brought us down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for thirteen yards, till we came to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cavern, that was ſix yards long, and four and a half broad. Here we found a perpendicular tunnel, two yards wide, and ſixty-ſeven yards deep; but where it went to, and what cauſed the noiſe below, the gentlemen who came thus far with me, could not tell; for they had never ventured into it, nor could they perſuade any of their people to be let down to the bottom, tho' they had found by the lead that there was hard ground below. I will then, (I ſaid) explore this ſubterranean realm, if you will let me and my lad down, with proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences for an enquiry of the kind, and I dare ſay I will give you a good account of the region below. This (they anſwered) was not ſafe for me to do. I might periſh many ways. The damps and vapours might kill me at once; or my lights by them might be put out, or kindle the vapour of the place below. But to this I ſaid, that I was ſure the noiſe we heard at the bottom was ſome running water, and wherever that was in the caverns of the earth, the air muſt be
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0028500100:380"/>pure and good. So Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> ſays in his general hiſtory of the air; and ſo I have often found it in my deſcents to the deepeſt mines. — As you pleaſe then; (the gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied): you ſhall have every thing you can deſire, and be let down very ſafely, however you may fare when you get to the ground: and when you want to come up, pull the packthread you have in your hand, that will be tied to a bell at the top of the tunnel, and you ſhall be immediately drawn up again. Theſe things being agreed, they let me down in a proper baſket the next morning at eight o'clock, with a lighted torch in my hand, and ſoon after my man <hi>Ralph</hi> followed with every thing I had required. I was more than half an hour going down, for the rope was given like a jack line from the engine it came from. I ſaw ſeveral diſmal lateral holes by the way; but no miſchief or inconvenience did I meet with in my paſſage to the ground.</p>
               <p>When I came to the bottom, <note place="margin">1725. June 20. 8th day from my leaving Jack Price's.</note> I found I was in a chamber of a great extent, and tho' 103 yards from the day, breathed as free as if I had been above ground. A little river made a noiſe in its fall from a high rock, within four yards of the ſpot I landed on, and ran with impetuoſity in a rough channel I knew not where. The water was not deep, as we found with our poles, and but three yards broad, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0028500100:381"/>we croſſed it, at 100 yards from the fall, to get into a cavern that had an arched en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, on the other ſide, within two yards of the ſtream. Our courſe to the croſſing was due weſt, and then we went to the north, on paſſing the water, and walking up the ſecond cave.</p>
               <p>In it we aſcended for 79 yards, an eaſy riſing way, and then came to a ſwallow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which a river that ran towards us fell. Our courſe to this place was due north, but as the flood came from the weſt, we turned next to that point, and by the ſide of this water marched 50 yards. The cavern was ſo wide we could not ſee the walls, and the roof was of a vaſt height.</p>
               <p>At the end of the 50 yards, the river ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared due north again, and by its ſide we went for 10 more, till we came to another vaſt cavern, that was a ſteep aſcending open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, down which the river very muſically came. This place was ſo like <hi>Pool's-hole,</hi> that I might think myſelf in the <hi>Peak.</hi> It was juſt ſuch another grand opening, up the inſide of a mountain, and had not only the deſcending flood, but as many beautiful <hi>ſtalactical concretions</hi> on the riſing way; which formed the moſt beautiful pillars, walls, and figures of the fineſt carved work; but in this it differed from <hi>Pools-hole,</hi> that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0028500100:382"/>opening in <hi>Richmondſhire</hi> is much wider; the rough, open ſteep, much higher to the roof; and this ſteep reaches to the ſummit of the vaſt hills, and ends in an opening in day. We came out this way on the top of an exceeding high mountain, after we had climbed from the bottom to the upper end 479 yards

The account of this in <hi>Camden</hi> is very imperfect, and next to nothing: and what the authors of the <hi>Tour through Great-Britain</hi> ſay of it, even in their 5th edition, in the year 1753, only ſhews to one who has been there, and carefully examined it, that neither <hi>Daniel Defoe,</hi> nor thoſe ſince concerned in improving and correcting the four volumes of the Tour, ever were in the inſide of <hi>Pool's-hole.</hi> Their deſcription of this, like a thouſand other places in thoſe volumes, is mere imagination (with ſome things from Cotton's falſe account) and the fancy not only wrong, but very bad.—I would deſcribe it here, but that the reader will find me in <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> before I take my leave of him, if death does not prevent, and I ſhall then give a full and true hiſtory of this high and rough country; its waters, curioſities, and antiquities: — At preſent, I ſhall only obſerve, to abate the wonder of my paſſing from the bottom of the inſide of one of the Richmond mountains to the plain on the top of it, that

the hill in which is <hi>Pool's-hole</hi> is open within ſide, in the aſcent, ſo far, that 5 yards more of aperture would bring one to the outſide of the top: and I believe it is very poſſible for art to make an entrance that way, as nature has done at the bottom.</p>

: add to this 229 yards, the way we had come from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the tunnel to the beginning of the watery ſteep, and our march through the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0028500100:383"/>mountain, from the time we parted with the gentlemen, to our getting out at the top of it, was 708 yards.</p>
               <p>This was a laborious route, and at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of our lives, many times, performed. Once, in particular, my lad <hi>Ralph</hi> fell into the river with his torch in the great aſcent, and in ſtriving to ſave his life, I loſt the other light I carried in my hand. This reduced us to a ſtate of the blackeſt darkneſs, and in that condition, we could not ſtir. It was a horrible ſcene. It chilled my blood, and curdled it in my veins: but I had a tinder-box, matches, and wax-candle, in my pocket, and ſoon recovered the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light; at which we lit other torches, and proceeded to aſcend the rough and rocky ſteep, till we came to the fountain that made the deſcending flood. The opening upwards from that became very narrow, and the ſlant ſo great, that it was extremely difficult to go on; but as I could ſee the day at the end of it, I reſolved to ſtrive hard, and mount, if poſſible, theſe remaining 60 yards. In ſhort, we did the work. As before related, we
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0028500100:384"/>came out this way, and from the diſmal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of night aſcended to a delightful plain; from which we again beheld the glorious ſun, and had the fineſt points of view. It was by this time noon, and under the ſhade of ſome aged trees, that grew on the banks of a great lake, on the ſummit of this vaſt hill, I ſat down to ſome bread and wine I had brought with me for relief. Never was repaſt more ſweet. I was not only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued very much; but, had been in fear as to my ever climbing up, and knew not how to get down, when I had mounted two thirds of the way. The deſcent was a thouſand times more dangerous than the going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top.</p>
            </div>

               <head>72. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the top of the mountain, we had travelled through, and arrive at Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court's houſe.</head>
               <p> When I had done, I walked about to ſee if there was any way down the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's ſides, to go to <hi>Ulubrae,</hi> from whence I came; but for miles it was a frightful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular rock, next that place, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a goat to deſcend; and on the ſide that faced Biſhoprick, and a fine country houſe and gardens, about a quarter of a mile off, in a delightful valley, that extended with all the beauties of wood and lawn, meadow and water, from the foot of the mountain I was on, the precipice here was a terrible way for a man to venture down; but it was poſſible to do it with a long pole, at
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0028500100:385"/>the hazard of his life, as the rocks projected in many places, and the ſide went ſloping off; and therefore I reſolved to deſcend. I could not think of going back the way I came; ſince I had got ſafe into day again, I thought it better to riſk my limbs in the face of the ſun, than periſh as I might do in the black and diſmal inſide of thoſe tremendous hills. Beſides, the houſe in my view, might be perhaps the one I wanted. It was poſſible my friend <hi>Turner</hi> might live there.</p>
               <p>With art and caution then I began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, and ſo happily took every offered ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of jutting rock and path in my way, that without any accident I got in ſafety down; tho' the perils were ſo great, that often I could not reach from rock to rock with my pole. In this caſe, I aimed the point of my pole at the ſpot I intended to light on, and clapped my feet cloſe to it, when I went off in the air from the rock: the pole coming firſt to the place broke the fall, and then ſliding gently down by it, I pitched on the ſpot I deſigned to go to, though ſix, ſeven, or eight fathom off, and the part of the rock below not more than a yard broad. It is a frightful piece of activity to a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander; but the youths on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Ireland make nothing of it: they are as expert at this work as the <hi>Teneriff</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:0028500100:386"/>men: from them I learned it; and made <hi>Ralph</hi> ſo perfect in the action, while he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with me, that he could go from rock to rock like a bird.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>My recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Mr. Harcourt's houſe.</label> When we came to the ground,  I ſent my man before me to the houſe, with my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice to Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> the maſter of it, and to let him know, that I had travelled through the inſide of one of the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that ſurrounded his houſe, and on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the top of it, had made the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice next him my road to the valley he lived in; that I knew not which way to turn next, in order to go to <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and begged leave to dine with him and receive his information. — This ſtrange meſſage, delivered by <hi>Ralph</hi> with much comic gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that gentleman could not tell what to make of; as I had ordered my young man not to explain himſelf, but ſtill ſay, that we had travelled the inſide of the mountain, and came down the precipice. This was ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing a thing to Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> and his daughter, that they walked out with ſome impatience to ſee this extraordinary traveller, and expreſſed no little amazement, when they came near me. After a ſalute, Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> told me he did not underſtand what my ſervant had ſaid to him; nor could he comprehend how I arrived in this valley, as there was but one paſſage into it at the front
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0028500100:387"/>of his houſe; and my being on foot too, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the wonder of my appearing in the place: but whatever way I came, I was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his houſe, and he would ſhew me the way in.</p>
               <p>My arrival here, Sir, (I replied) is to be ſure very ſtrange, and would be almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to hear told by another perſon, of one that journeyed 229 yards deep, to the foundation of this Alp, on the other ſide of it, then aſcended a hollow way, till he got out at the top, and came down a high and frightful precipice to the vale below: But here I am a proof of the fact. I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain how it was done; and I began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late every particular at large.</p>
               <p>But tell me, Sir, (Miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſaid) if you pleaſe, why did you not return the way you came; ſince the other ſide of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is impoſſible to deſcend, as you inform us, on account of its being a perpendicular ſteep; and that you muſt have hazarded your life a thouſand times, in coming down the way you did with the pole? I tremble as I look at the place, and only with fancy's eye, ſee you on the deſcent. Beſide, the gentlemen you left on the other ſide of the hill, will conclude you loſt, and be very greatly troubled on the account.</p>
               <p>My reaſon, Madam, (I anſwering, ſaid) for coming down this very dangerous way,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0028500100:388"/>was, becauſe I thought it, with all its perils, much ſafer than the inſide road I had come. My activity, I had reaſon to think, was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the difficulties of the outward way, and if I ſhould fall, it would be in the light of heaven, with a human habitation in view, that might afford me ſome relief, if I only broke my bones; but, if in deſcending the very ſteep and horrible caverns of the hill, which with the greateſt difficulty I climbed up, I ſhould happen to get a fall, as in all human probability I would, and break a limb in theſe moſt diſmal cavities of eternal night, I muſt have periſhed in the moſt miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, without a poſſibility of obtaining any relief. Nor is this all, madam. The thing that brought me here among the mountains of Richmondſhire, was to find a gentleman of my acquaintance, and when I ſaw your houſe from the top of the mountain, I did not know but it might be his. I fanſied it was, as the ſituation anſwered my friend's deſcription of the ſpot he lived on.</p>
               <p>And if it had been his, madam, it would have put an end to all my toils; for I am a wanderer upon the face of the earth, through the cruelty of a mother-in-law; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of a rich father; who has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, becauſe I will not ſubmit to the declarations and deciſions of weak and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible men, in matters of pure revelation and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:0028500100:389"/>divine faith, and own the infallibility of the orthodox ſyſtem. Becauſe the aſſent of my mind could not go beyond the perception of my underſtanding, and I would not allow that the popular confeſſion is the faith once delivered to the ſaints, therefore I was thrown off, and obliged to become the pilgrim you ſee before you.</p>
               <p>This hiſtory of a forlorn ſeemed ſtranger to the young lady and her father than even the account of my journey through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of a mountain, and down a precipice that a goat would ſcarce venture. They were both very greatly amazed at my relation, and Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> was going to aſk me ſome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when one of his ſervants came to let him know that dinner was ſerving up, and by this put an end to our converſation. The maſter of the houſe brought me into a fine room, and I ſaw on the table an elegant dinner: there was likewiſe a grand ſideboard, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men ſervants attending: miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſat at the head of the table, and at her right hand two young ladies, vaſtly handſome, whom I ſhall have occaſion to mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in this journal: two ladies more were on the other ſide of her, pretty women, but no beauties; and next them ſat three gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſenſible, well-behaved men; one of them a maſter of muſick, the other a maſter
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0028500100:390"/>languages, and the third a great painter; who were kept in the houſe on large ſalaries, to teach the young lady theſe things: Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> placed me by himſelf, and was not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely civil, but manifeſted a kind of fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as if he was well pleaſed with my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. He and his daughter took great care of me, and treated me as if I had been a man of diſtinction rather than the poor pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim they ſaw me, with my ſtaff in my hand. The young lady talked to me in a very pleaſant manner, and as I ſaw the whole company were inclined to be very chearful, I clubbed as much as I could to promote good-humour, and encreaſe the feſtivity of the table. We laughed the afternoon away in a charming manner, and when we had done, we all went to walk in the gardens. Here the company ſoon ſeparated, as the various beauties of the place inclined various minds to different things and parts. Some, penſive roamed in ſhady walks; ſome ſat by playing fountains; and others went to gather fruits and flowers. I had the honour to walk with Miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> to a canal at ſome diſtance, and as we went, this young lady told me, ſhe did not well underſtand me as to what I had ſaid of religion being concerned in my becoming a traveller, and deſired me to be a little more particular. That I will,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0028500100:391"/>and immediately proceeded in the following manner.</p>

               <p> My father, madam, is a man of great learning, virtue and knowledge, but <hi>ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> to the laſt degree, and ſent me to the univerſity on purpoſe to make me a <hi>theologer,</hi> that I might be an able defender of the <hi>Creed of St. Athanaſius,</hi> and convince the poor people of the country he lived in, and in good time (he fondly hoped) the inhabitants of many other countries; that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſymbol I have mentioned is what no human apprehenſion can comprehend, and the <hi>judgment</hi> hath nothing to act on in the conſideration of it;—that there is nothing to be underſtood in that ſymbol, nor can a man form any determination of the matter therein contained; — yet they muſt <hi>believe</hi> this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>awful myſtery:</hi> that three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Gods are only one perſon and God; and, on <hi>peril of eternal miſery,</hi> they muſt confeſs that, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> tho' <hi>three Beings, as diſtinct as any three things in the univerſe,</hi> yet are only <hi>one Being.</hi> This myſtery I was to preach up in his church, (a church in a field, near his houſe, to which he had the right of preſenting,) and enflame the people againſt <hi>reaſon,</hi> that trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to God and religion, which our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, the Chriſtian deiſts, would make Lord and King in oppoſition to <hi>faith.</hi> I
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0028500100:392"/>was to tell my beloved, that reaſon is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſual devil, and that inſtead of heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to this tempter, they muſt aſſent to thoſe heavenly propoſitions, which give wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without ideas, and certainty without knowledge. You muſt believe, my beloved, that none is before or after the other. — None is greater or leſs than another. The infidels call this an unintelligible <hi>piece of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe:</hi> but it is, my beloved, <hi>a very tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent myſtery.</hi> It does, we muſt own, <hi>ſtagger</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſh</hi> us, being a thing beyond our reach to comprehend; but, it muſt be believed, on peril of eternal miſery, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved: and it is eaſy to be believed, for this <hi>plain reaſon,</hi> (given by a very learned and pious biſhop of our church) to wit, that <hi>it is too high to be by us comprehended.</hi> This was the opinion of that great prelate, Dr. <hi>Beveridge,</hi> in his <hi>Private Thoughts,</hi> p. 52. to which book I refer you, my beloved, for more of his admirable reaſoning on this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital article, and farther obſerve to you, that not only this moſt pious biſhop, and many other moſt excellent prelates were of this way of thinking; but all the moſt admirable divines have declared in their ſermons, and other matchleſs writings, that the <hi>more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible</hi> the <hi>Athanaſian creed</hi> is, and the <hi>fuller of contradictions,</hi> the more honour we do to our God in believing it. It is the glory of <hi>orthodox Chriſtians,</hi> that their <hi>faith</hi> is not
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0028500100:393"/>only contrary to the carnal mind, but even to the <hi>moſt exalted reaſon.</hi> In matters of faith, we muſt renounce our reaſon, even tho' it be the only thing that diſtinguiſhes us from the beaſts, and makes us capable of any religion at all. No human arguments are to interfere in this victorious principle: the <hi>catholic faith</hi> is the reverſe of rational re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and except a man believe it faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he muſt go into everlaſting fire and brimſtone

                     <p>Little did I think when I talked in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> againſt the <hi>famous ſymbol,</hi> that I ſhould ever find in the book of a moſt learned man an excellent divine, the ſame kind of arguments ſeriouſly produced in favor of the Creed of St. Athanaſius: yet this ſtrange thing has time brought on, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the world, that the greateſt <hi>learning</hi> and the moſt exalted <hi>piety,</hi> employed in the cauſe of <hi>myſtery,</hi> can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo <hi>extravagant</hi> and <hi>erring</hi> as to mentain that a thing <hi>incomprehenſible to human reaſon,</hi> can be <hi>revealed,</hi> and that <hi>the more incomprehenſible</hi> it is to human reaſon, and the more ſenſeleſs it appears to human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the more glorious is the object of faith, and the more worthy to be believed by a chriſtian. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable argument for the truth of chriſtianity I met with in a book lately publiſhed by an admirable man, <hi>Dr. Joſeph Smith,</hi> provoſt of Queen's-college, Oxon.

.</p>
               <p>In this manner, madam, like a <hi>mad bigot,</hi> a <hi>flaming zealot,</hi> and a <hi>ſublime believer,</hi> was I to preach to the people of Ireland, and be
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0028500100:394"/>an apoſtle for that faith which is an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to unreaſonable commands: but <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately,</hi> for my father's deſign; and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately,</hi> for my ſoul; I was, on entring the univerſity, put into the hands of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who abhorred <hi>modern orthodoxy,</hi> and made the eſſential conſtitutive happineſs and perfection of every intelligent being conſiſt in the conformity of our mind to the moral rectitude of the Divine Nature. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man convinced my underſtanding, that even faith in Chriſt is of an inferior na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this: it is only the means to obtain it. Such a conformity and obedience of the heart and conſcience to the will of God ought to be my religion, as it was the religion of our Saviour himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus, madam, was I inſtructed by a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of arts, my private tutor, and when to his leſſons I added my own careful exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the <hi>vulgar faith,</hi> and the mind of our Lord as I found it in the <hi>books,</hi> I was thoroughly ſatisfied, that an act of faith is an act of reaſon, and an act of reaſon an act of faith, in religious matters; — that our Lord was not the great God; nor a part of that <hi>compound,</hi> called the <hi>Triune-God;</hi> the miſerable invention of divines; but, a more extraordinary meſſenger than the prophets under the law, choſen by the divine wiſdom, to publiſh the will of God to mankind, and ſent under the character of <hi>his ſon,</hi> and <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0028500100:395"/>heir of his inheritance the church, to new form the ages,</hi> and fix ſuch good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes in the minds of men, as would be productive of all righteouſneſs in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: that he was ſent to deſtroy ſin and the kingdom of Satan; and to bring the human race to a perfect obedience to the will of <hi>the Supreme Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this, madam, was as plain to me as the ſun in ſummer's bright day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, inſtead of laying aſide my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and believing things without any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ground or evidence at all; — inſtead of going into order, to draw revealed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from revealed propoſitions, and by a deep logic, make ſcripture conſequences, that have no meaning in the words, for the faith of the people; I was ſo free and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as to let my father know, that of all things in the world I never would be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince the character obliged me to ſwear and ſubſcribe to articles I could not find in my bible; nor would I, as a layman, ever read, or join in the ſervice of reading the tritheiſtic liturgy and offices he uſed in his family. I was determined, tho' I loſt his favor and large fortune by the reſolution; to live and die a <hi>Chriſtian deiſt;</hi> confeſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men the <hi>perſonal unity and perfections</hi> of the <hi>true God,</hi> and the <hi>perſonal mediatorial office</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>St. Paul</hi> mentained the <hi>perſonal unity</hi> and <hi>abſolute ſupremacy</hi> of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0028500100:396"/>the <hi>true God,</hi> and in his deſcription of the <hi>Deity,</hi> did not tell the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that he was a <hi>Triune Being,</hi> to be conſidered under the notion of <hi>three perſons, of three under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and wills, in a co-ordinate triplicity of all divine attributes and perfections;</hi> but <hi>one individual perſonal Agent, — one great Spirit, or mind, ſelf-exiſtent, and omnipotent in wiſdom and action — one Supreme Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator and Governor of the world, — the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I ſhall therefore, in obedience to the apoſtle, and to the other inſpired writers, believe in an worſhip the ſame God, the <hi>One God,</hi> the <hi>only true God,</hi> as our <hi>Lord</hi> ſays in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark;</hi> — through the alone <hi>media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interceſſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and only begotten Son of God; — depending upon the effectual aid and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the bleſſed Spirit, in hope of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious immortality. This is,—this ſhall be my religion, whatever I may feel from an <hi>antichriſtian tyranny,</hi> on account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.—Tho' an outrage of uncharitable zeal ſhould ſtrip me of every worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and reduce me to a want of bread.—If I ſhould become a ſpectacle to men and angels by this <hi>faith,</hi> yet I will believe as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>apoſtles</hi> have ordered the world to believe. — No <hi>unintelligible cant,</hi> or <hi>ſcholaſtic jargon</hi> for me. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> has in ſcripture expreſſed it <hi>ſufficiently</hi> and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0028500100:397"/>
                  <hi>unexceptionably</hi> clear, — that there is <hi>One Supreme Independent Firſt-Cauſe of all things, a Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>One Spirit, One God: I am God, and there is none like me: I am God,</hi> and <hi>there is none elſe; beſide Me; with Me; none but Me.</hi> — Thus does the Holy Ghoſt declare; and what ſignify the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, heretical declarations of the doctors, in reſpect of this?</p>
               <p>Then, as a teſt of Chriſtianity, the ſame bleſſed Spirit adds, — <hi>that Jeſus is the true Meſſiah, was ſent from God to reveal his will for the ſalvation of man, and is the only Mediator betwixt God and man.</hi> Thus has the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> regulated our faith and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and I think it incumbent on me to mind what he ſays, and flee the <hi>invented pieties</hi> of our <hi>theologers.</hi>—I did ſo, and diſobliged my father. I loſt his favor intirely. He would take no farther notice of me, and I became as you ſee a wanderer.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe, delivered with my fire and action, amazed Miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſo greatly, that for ſome time after I had done, ſhe could not ſpeak, but continued looking with great earneſtneſs at me. At laſt however ſhe ſaid, I am glad, Sir, it has been my fate to meet with you, and muſt, when there is more time, converſe with you on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. My father and I have had ſome doubts as to the truth of the <hi>Athanaſian creed;</hi> but he told me, he did not chuſe to examine the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0028500100:398"/>thing, as it had the ſanction of ages, and was believed by the greateſt divines in all nations. If it be wrong, let the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men anſwer for it. But this does not ſatisfy me; and ſince I have ſeen one that has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken all rather than live a diſciple of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> after a thorough examination of the ſyſtem; and that you have now ſaid ſome things againſt it that ſhew the folly of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, and make it a faith the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and unreaſonable, I am determined to enquire into the merit of it, and ſee if chriſtians ought to acknowledge the ſupreme dominion and authority of God the Father; — that the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>abſolutely God,</hi> the <hi>great God in the abſolute ſupreme ſenſe by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> only a <hi>God</hi> by <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>divinity</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> that is, by having <hi>received</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Cauſe,</hi> his <hi>being, attributes,</hi> and <hi>power over the whole creation:</hi> — or, if they ought to aſcribe ſupreme authority, and original independent abſolute dominion to God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>three diſtinct ſupreme gods,</hi> and yet but <hi>one ſupreme God,</hi> as the <hi>church</hi> informs us in her <hi>famous creed,</hi> and thereby makes us ſwallow a <hi>contradiciton,</hi> as I have often thought, and a doctrine againſt which a great number of texts can be produced. This I will examine. My reaſon ſhall be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſilent in ſo important a caſe. If a

                  <hi>Trinity in unity of equal minds or gods</hi> is not to be proved by the inſpired writings, the doctors preaching it, and by creed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, will be no juſtifiable plea or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for me, I am ſenſible, in the great riſing day.

               <head>74. Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation on our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and generous offer to me.</head>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> came up to us,  and deſired to know, (if it was a fair queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) what we two had been talking ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly on; for it ſeemed at a diſtance to be ſomething more than ordinary. I will tell you, Sir, his daughter replied, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately began to relate the whole conference, and her reſolution. Your reſolution (the father ſaid) is excellent. You have not only my conſent, but I recommend it to you as the nobleſt work you can employ any time on. For my part, Sir, (Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, turning himſelf to me) I never liked this part of our proteſtant religion, and have often wiſhed our public prayers had been more conformable to the ſimplicity of the goſpel; that we had been contented with what our Maſter and the Holy Spirit deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not made human compoſitions the ſtandard of ſalvation: but ſince the church in her wiſdom has thought it ſhould be otherwiſe, I have ſubmitted to her authority, and been ſilent on the doctrines ſhe claims a right to determine; though ſome of them to me appear doubtful, and others repugnant to ſcripture: beſide, my ſtudies have been in other fields than that of controverſy: mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics and antiquities have employed my time, and I have neither taſte nor capacity for that criticiſm which is neceſſary for the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0028500100:401"/>examination of ſuch points: greatly however do I honour thoſe who have the ability and patience to go through the work, as I muſt own it is of the moſt importance, and that the <hi>orthodox faith</hi> is a <hi>ſad thing,</hi> if the truth be, after all our Athanaſian believing, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no more than <hi>God's inſtrument,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> name him; a <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teacher</hi> of <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and <hi>redemption:</hi> and that God is to be <hi>owned</hi> and <hi>praiſed,</hi> as the <hi>true, chief,</hi> and <hi>original cauſe</hi> of all <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the counſel of his own will, his own good pleaſure, purpoſe,</hi> etc. without <hi>partner</hi> or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon,</hi> to <hi>intreat</hi> and <hi>ſatisfy</hi> for us. If this be the caſe, may the Lord have mercy on our poor orthodox ſouls: and as it may be ſo, I honour you for enquiring into the matter, and eſpecially for your good Spirit in prefering the things that are eternal, when what you thought truth could not be held with things temporal. I have (Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> continued) a very great eſteem for you on this account, and if I can be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you, I will. He imagined I might want money, and if I did, he would lend me a hundred guineas, without intereſt, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on my note of hand, when I could. He immediately took out of his pocket-book a bank note for that ſum, and preſſed me to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0028500100:402"/>accept it. He likewiſe invited me to ſtay at his houſe, while he continued in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which would be for a month longer. He aſſured me alſo, that I might make it my reſidence after he left it, if I pleaſed: there would be two ſervants to attend me, and there was excellent mutton, and other things, for my table. Nor is this all; you ſhall have the key of my ſtudy.</p>
               <p>Theſe offers aſtoniſhed me, and I ſaid, moſt generous Sir, I return you the thanks of a grateful heart, and will ever remember your goodneſs to me with that ſenſe ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common kindneſs deſerves, tho' I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefits you would make me happy with. As to money, I do not want any yet, and when I do, it will be time enough for me to borrow, if I ſhould find any one, like you, ſo benevolently diſpoſed as to lend me caſh without ſecurity and intereſt: and as to ſtaying at your houſe, that offer I cannot accept, as I am engaged to a near and rich friend, who will be to me a ſubaltern provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if he can be found, and ſecure me from the evils my attachment to truth has expoſed me to. One week however I will ſtay with you, ſince you are ſo good as to invite me in this kind manner.</p>
               <p>Here then I ſtayed a week, and paſſed it in a moſt happy way. Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> was
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0028500100:403"/>fond of me, and did every thing in his power to render the place agreeable. His lovely daughter was not only as civil as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be, but did me the honour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a friendſhip with me, which laſted from that time till death deſtroyed the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thread that linked it.</p>

               <head>75. An account of Harriot Euſebia Harcourt.</head>
               <p> Reader, this young lady, <hi>Harriot Euſebia Harcourt,</hi> was the foundreſs of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houſe of proteſtant recluſes, who are ſtill a ſociety in that part of <hi>Richmondſhire</hi> where firſt I ſaw her and her father. They are under no vow, but while they pleaſe to continue members, live as they do in nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, and in piety, and in all the parts of the chriſtian temper, endeavour a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of their divine Lord and Maſter; with this diſtinction however, that to the plan of the regards due from man by the divine Law to God, to his fellow-creatures, and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they add muſick and painting for their diverſion, and unbend their minds in theſe delightful arts, for a few hours every day. This makes them excel in theſe particulars. They are great maſters in all kinds of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and do wonders with the pencil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euſebia</hi> was but juſt turned of twenty when I firſt ſaw her, in the year 1725, and then her muſical performances were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable — her pictures had the ordonnance,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0028500100:404"/>colouring, and expreſſion of a great maſter. She was born with a pictureſque genius, and a capacity to give meaſure and movement to compoſitions of harmony. Her muſic at the time I am ſpeaking of had a moſt ſurprizing power: and in painting, long before this time, ſhe aſtoniſhed. When ſhe was a child, nine years old, and had no maſter, ſhe would ſketch with a black lead pencil on a ſheet of paper the pictures of various kinds that came in her way, and make ſuch imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as deſerved the attention of judges. This made her father get her an eminent maſter, and ſhe had not been long under his direction, when ſhe was able to infuſe a ſoul into her figures, and motion into her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. She not only drew landſkips, and low ſubjects with a ſucceſs great as <hi>Teniers,</hi> but evinced by her paintings, that ſhe brought into the world with her an aptitude for works of a ſuperior claſs. Her pictures ſhew that ſhe was not the laſt among the painters of hiſtory. They are as valuable for the merit of the execution as for the merit of the ſubjects.</p>

               <p> Her hiſtories of the revelations of St. John, which ſhe finiſhed a little before her death, from the firſt viſion to the laſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a genius very wonderful, and that her hand was perfected at the ſame time
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0028500100:405"/>with her imagination. If this ſeries of pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is not in every reſpect equal to <hi>Giotto's</hi> on the ſame ſubject, (which I have ſeen in the cloyſter of St. Clare at Naples), yet theſe paintings are treated with greater truth, and ſhew that the imagination of the painter had a hand and eye at its diſpoſal to diſplay the fineſt and compleateſt ideas. The great artiſt is obvious in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Pictures.</label> The firſt picture of this Series is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the inſide of the glorious temple, (that was made the grand ſcene of all the things <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw <hi>in the Spirit),</hi> the golden-lamp-ſconce, called the ſeven candleſticks, which afforded the ſanctuary all its light, and the auguſt perſonage, who appears in refulgent brightneſs in the viſion, in the midſt of the ſeven golden candleſticks. The majeſtic and godlike form which the apoſtle beheld is wonderfully painted. He is repreſented with more than human ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Like <hi>Raphael,</hi> in his picture of the <hi>Eternal Father,</hi> in one of the Vatican cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, ſhe does not inſpire us merely with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſhe ſtrikes us even with an awful terror: elle n'inſpire pas une ſimple venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, elle-imprime une terreur reſpectueuſe. In his right hand, this grand perſon holds the main ſhaft that ſupports the ſix branches of the ſix lighted lamps, and the ſeventh lamp
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0028500100:406"/>at the top of the main trunk, which gleam like a rod of ſeven ſtars, as it is written, <hi>having in his hand ſeven ſtars,</hi> and in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, with his face to the apoſtle, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the midſt of the ſeven golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, the emblems of the churches, walking, or attending to trim them, the churches; with a <hi>ſharp two-edged ſword,</hi> that is, the powerful word of God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> walked to trim the real lamps with the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſnuffers. <hi>St. John</hi> is ſeen on the floor. He is looking in great ſurprize at the whole appearance, and as with amazement he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the divine Perſon in the viſion, he ſeems ſtruck with dread, and going to faint away; as he ſays in the <hi>Apocalyps, — When I ſaw him, I fell at his feet as dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Picture 2.</label> The next picture in this ſeries is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of, or another repreſentation of the inſide of the temple, the golden lamp-ſconce of ſeven golden candleſticks, and the auguſt perſonage in refulgent brightneſs, and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors tranſcendently glorious; but with this difference, that in this piece, the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage does not hold the main ſhaft of the branches of lights in his right-hand, or ſtand <hi>in the midſt of the candleſticks;</hi> but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſublime dignity, is painted with a godlike compaſſion in his face and manner, and with the greateſt tenderneſs
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0028500100:407"/>raiſes and ſupports the apoſtle. You ſee him (as <hi>St. John</hi> deſcribes him); — <hi>he laid his right-hand upon me</hi> (the hand which before held the ſeven ſtars, or lighted golden lamps, that exhibited an appearance not unlike a conſtellation of ſtars) <hi>ſaying unto me, fear not. I am the firſt and the laſt. I am he that liveth, even tho' I was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen. And I have the keys of hell and of death.</hi> — One almoſt hears theſe words from the lips of the auguſt form, ſo wonderfully is the figure painted,— ſo happily has the pencil counterfeited na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and the apoſtle appears to revive in tranſports, as he knows from the words that it is his Lord and Maſter is ſpeaking to him. It is a fine picture.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Picture 3.</label> The third painting in this ſeries is the ſubſequent viſion, in the 4th and 5th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelation of John the Divine.</hi> — In a part of the heavens that are opened, the throne of God is repreſented by a cryſtal ſeat or glory, and from it proceed flaſhings of a bright flame like lightning and thunder, to repreſent the awful majeſty of the <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>One Only, True God,</hi> the <hi>Supreme Lord</hi> of all things: ſeven lamps of fire are burning before this throne, as emblems of the ſeven ſpirits, or principal ſervants of God, to ſhew with what purity, conſtancy, and zeal, the ſpirits of the juſt
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0028500100:408"/>made perfect ſerve God in the heavenly church; and next them appears a cryſtal ſea of great brightneſs and beauty; much more glorious than the brazen ſea in the temple, which held the water for the uſe of the prieſts. This ſea alludes to that purity that is required in all perſons who have the honour and happineſs of a near approach to God, as he manifeſts himſelf on the <hi>throne of inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible light,</hi> or, in the <hi>moral Shechinah</hi> in this lower world 

<note n="(37.)" place="bottom">
                     <p>As the firſt notion of <hi>God's glory,</hi> in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a phyſical notion, and ſignifies the manifeſtation of God, by fire, light, clouds, brightneſs, and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teorous ſymbols, ſuch as the <hi>marching pillars of fire and cloud</hi> that went before the Iſraelites, and the <hi>Shechinah</hi> in the Holy of Holies, which the Jews called the <hi>viſible preſence;</hi> ſo is there a <hi>glory of God</hi> in a <hi>moral ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There is a <hi>Shechinah</hi> in a <hi>phyſical ſenſe</hi> by fire, light, and refracted colours: and there is a <hi>moral She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah,</hi> or glory, when men live in obedience to all the divine laws, and walk as children of light. This ſhews the <hi>ſpecial preſence</hi> of God in the <hi>righteous,</hi> as much as the <hi>cloud of glory</hi> did manifeſt him in the <hi>temple.</hi> The power and wiſdom and goodneſs of God are diſplayed in the holy lives of men. Like the heavens they declare his glory, and are the viſible epiſtle of Chriſt to the world, written not with ink, but with the ſpirit of the Living God. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that his Spirit dwelleth in you?</hi>

The next figures are the four living creatures, or cherubim of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel (which our Engliſh tranſlation very badly renders <hi>four beaſts)</hi> and they are placed in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0028500100:409"/>the middle of each ſide of the throne, in he whole circle round about, full of eyes, not only before but behind: ſo as to have a direct and full view every way: without-ſide them, on ſeats, are the four and twenty elders placed, in white and ſhining garments, with crowns of gold upon their heads. The perſon who ſits on the throne appears in great majeſty and glory, and round about his throne the moſt beautiful rainbow is ſeen; to expreſs the glory of God, and his faithfulneſs to his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promiſe: the four living creatures next the throne, who repreſent the angels attendant on the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> and have the appearance of a lion, a calf, a man, and an eagle, full of eyes, and with ſix wings, to expreſs the great underſtanding and power of the angels, their activity, conſtancy, and good will; — they are drawn in the act of adoring and praiſing the eternal living God; and are anſwered by the four and twenty el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the repreſentatives of the people, the churches. So inimitably are all theſe things painted, that the faces of the <hi>cherubim</hi> and the <hi>four and twenty elders</hi> ſeem to move in worſhip and thankſgiving: one acquainted with the divine ſongs, cannot help fanſying that he hears the <hi>four living creatures,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come;</hi> who for ever
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0028500100:410"/>waſt, and for ever wilt be, the one true God, the everlaſting Lord: and that the <hi>elders,</hi> that is, the <hi>Chriſtian people,</hi> reply, <hi>Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power: for Thou haſt created all things, and for Thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The apoſtle, <hi>St. John,</hi> appears in great admiration, on account of the things before him, but ſeems more particularly affected by a book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, which the perſon who ſits on the throne holds in his right-hand;—an angel who is painted in the act of proclaiming with a loud voice, <hi>Who is worthy to open the book, and to looſe the ſeals thereof</hi> — and a lamb with ſeven horns and eyes, ſtanding juſt before the throne, within the circles of the cherubim and elders: this Lamb, repreſented as a ſacrifice, and with ſeven horns and eyes, to ſhew the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wiſdom, and goodneſs of our Lord in the work of redemption, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all God's deſigns of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and grace, engages the attention and wonder of the apoſtle; and as this <hi>Lamb of God</hi> receives the <hi>book</hi> from the perſon on the throne, a riſing joy appears through the aſtoniſhment of <hi>St. John,</hi> and ſeems to be encreaſing, as he hears the <hi>living creatures</hi> and the elders ſing a new ſong, or hymn of a new compoſition, which expreſſes the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0028500100:411"/>honour of the Son of God, and our peculiar engagements to him, in theſe words — <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof: for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. — Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power and riches, and wiſdom and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing. — Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him, that ſitteth upon, the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> — And as the angels conclude this ſolemn act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by ſaying, <hi>Amen;</hi> and the <hi>people</hi> by <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him that liveth for ever and ever,</hi> the true God, who liveth and reigneth from everlaſting to everlaſting; and <hi>having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of you from his iniquities;</hi> the <hi>apoſtle</hi> ſeems in pleaſure to join them, and ſhews a ſenſibility and action that is very wonderful. It is a charming picture. The divine artiſt has treated the whole ſubject with the moſt elaborate and beautiful expreſſion, and with a delightful richneſs of local co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. This painting gives the beholder a full and fine idea of the <hi>viſion</hi>

               <p>But it was not only in painting,  and in muſick, that Miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> excelled: ſhe had, when I firſt ſaw her, made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in her ſtudies, and diſcovered in her converſation extraordinary abilities. She talked wiſely and learnedly on many ſubjects, and in ſo charming a manner, that ſhe entered into the poſſeſſion of the heart, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all that heard her: nor was it only in pure Italian, Spaniſh, and other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages that ſhe could expreſs her notions; but, in he correcteſt Latin ſhe often ſpoke to me, and for an hour would diſcourſe in the Roman tongue, with as great eaſe as if ſhe had been talking Engliſh. She ſpoke it without any manner of difficulty, which was more than I could do. I was ſlow, and pauſed ſometimes; but this young lady went on with that volubility of tongue the women are born with. The language being <hi>Latin</hi> was no check to her natural fluency of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>To all this let me add, and with truth I can add it, that <hi>Euſebia,</hi> from the time I was firſt acquainted with her to her death, walked in the fear of the Lord, and of conſequence, in the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0028500100:413"/>from her infancy as her ſtated and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary buſineſs, and her ſole concern to know and do her duty to God and men. The Proverbs of Solomon, and the pattern of Chriſt, were her ſtudy when a very young girl, and from both ſhe acquired a conduct ſo prudent and evangelical, that ſhe ſeemed at the greateſt heights of grace and goodneſs which a mortal can reach, and appeared as one that had made a prodigious proficiency in divine knowledge, and in every virtue: yet there was nothing gloomy, or even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in her behaviour: ſhe was good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour itſelf: frank and free; quite eaſy, and for ever chearful.</p>

                  <label>Her picture.</label> Miſs <hi>Harcourt,</hi> at the time I am ſpeaking of, that is, in the one and twentieth year of her age, had all the qualities that conſtitute a beauty: ſhe was tall and graceful, and in every action, and her whole behaviour, to the laſt degree charming: her eyes were vaſtly fine, large and long, even with her face, black as night, and had a ſparkling bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as great as could appear from the refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diamonds: her hair was as the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed jet, deep and gloſſy; and yet, her complexion freſh as the glories of the ſpring, and her lips like a beautiful flower.</p>

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0028500100:414"/>in 1733, and in the courſe of her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, did me the honour to write me many fine letters, in which ſhe obliged me with her remarks on the things and people they ſaw in many countries. We held a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence together, for a conſiderable part of the time, and in return for her valuable favours, I ſent her the beſt account I could give of the matters that came in my way. Theſe letters may perhaps appear ſome day.</p>
               <p>In the year 34 Mrs. <hi>Harcourt</hi> returned to England, and brought over with her ſome ladies, who became conſtituents of her clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral houſe. They formed the moſt rational and happy ſociety that ever united, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the foundreſs, reſided ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in one of the <hi>Weſtern Iſlands,</hi> but for the moſt part in <hi>Richmondſhire.</hi> Since her death, which happend in the year 45, they have lived intirely in the North of England, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all the world by the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mountains. They were but twelve in number for ſeveral years, but, in the ſixth year of the <hi>Inſtituto,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Harcourt</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed it to twenty-four members, by taking in twelve eleves or diſciples. The twelve ſeniors govern a year about in their turns, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be the requeſt of the houſe, that the <hi>ſuperior</hi> for the year paſt ſhould continue in the office another year. This, and their eaſy
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0028500100:415"/>circumſtances, ſecure their peace, and as they are ever wiſe to that which is good, and ſimple concerning evil, they lead moſt happy lives: nor can it be otherwiſe with mortals who cultivate the grace of humility (the want of which lies at the bottom of all contentions,) and by a chriſtian prudence, make it their main work to facilitate the practice of piety, and to promote the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and the luſtre of it. Glorious women! to letters, arts, and piety, they devote thoſe hours which others waſte in vanities the moſt ſenſeleſs and deſpicable; and purſuant to the advice, and according to the rule drawn up by their illuſtrious foundreſs, live as beings that have ſouls deſigned for eternity. They act continually upon a future proſpect, and give all diligence in making conſtant advances toward the perfect day. Mrs. <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſhewed them what an uninſpired mortal could do by the means of grace: that it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for aſſiſted human nature (feeble as fleſh and blood is) to reſiſt temptations the moſt violent, and by the ſupreme motives of our religion, acquit ourſelves like chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. If there be a devil to aſſault, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart to oppoſe, and many difficulties to be encountred, yet her conduct was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that thoſe who are heirs of the heavenly country, may chuſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0028500100:416"/>their beſt intereſts, and improve the divine life to a high degree. Let us (ſhe uſed to ſay) make ſalvation not only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on the bye, but the governing aim thro' the preſent life, and we ſhall not only live like the primitive chriſtians, but die for our holy faith, with more reſolution than the worthies of Greece and Rome, tho' death ſhould appear in all his array of terrors. Neither adverſity nor proſperity could then tempt us to drop a grain of incenſe before any idol, or commit any action that diſhonoured the goſpel. Let what will happen, in all events, we ſhould ſecure the future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſouls, and thereby provide for the everlaſting glory and felicity of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too in the morning of the reſurrection.</p>

               <p>The twenty-fifth day of <hi>June</hi> I took my leave of Miſs <hi>Harcourt</hi> and her father,  and the reſt of the good company, and on horſes I borrowed, we returned to the philoſophers at <hi>Ulubrae.</hi> It was nineteen miles round of moſt terrible road; a great part of it being deep and ſwampy bottom, with holes up to the horſes ſhoulders in ſome places; and for ſeveral miles, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ride on the ſides of very ſteep and craggy mountains, in a path ſo very narrow, that we riſked life, and paſſed in terror: a wrong ſtep would have been deſtruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0028500100:417"/>recovery. It was likewiſe no ſmall perplexity to find, that I was going back again, the courſe being ſouth and ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt; and that there was no other way of journeying from Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s to <hi>Ulubrae,</hi> but through the paſs I firſt travelled from <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> unleſs I rid from Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>'s into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and then round through <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> to the valley the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen lived in. On then I went at all hazards, and in a tedious manner was forced to creep the way: but to make ſome amends, the proſpects from the hills were fine, and things very curious occurred. Groupes of creſts of mountains appeared here and there, like large cities with towers and old Gothick edifices, and from caverns in their ſides torrents of water ſtreamed out, and tumbled in various courſes to the moſt delightful vales below. In ſome of the vaſt hills there were openings quite through, ſo as to ſee the ſun, at the end of three or four thouſand yards; and in many of them were ſloping caverns, very wonderful to behold.</p>

               <head>79. A fine chamber in a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a paſſage from the room to a valley on the other ſide of the vaſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice.</head>
               <p> I found in one of them, near the top of a very high mountain, a deſcent like ſteps of ſtairs, that was in breadth and height like the iſle of a church, for 300 yards, and then ended at a kind of door, or ſmall arched opening, that was high enough
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0028500100:418"/>for a tall man to walk into a grand room which it led to. This chamber was a ſquare of 17 yards, and had an arched roof about 20 high. The ſtone of it was a green marble, not earthy and opake, but pure and cryſtalline, which made it appear very beautiful, as the walls were as ſmooth as if the beſt poliſh had made them ſo. There was another opening or door at the other ſide of this chamber, and from it likewiſe went a deſcent like ſteps, but the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paſſage here was much ſteeper than the other I had come to, and the opening not more than one third as wide and high; nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing gradually to the bottom of the ſloping road, till it ended in a round hole, a yard and a quarter every way. I could ſee the day at the opening below, tho' it ſeemed at a great diſtance from me, and as it was not dangerous to deſcend, I determined to go down.</p>
               <p>The deſcent was 479 yards in a ſtraight line, and opened in a view of meadows, ſcattered trees, and ſtreams, that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantingly fine. There appeared to be about four and twenty acres of fine land, quite ſurrounded with the moſt frightful precipices in the world, and in the center of it a neat and pretty little country houſe, on an eaſy riſing ground. I could diſcover with my long
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0028500100:419"/>glaſs a young and handſome woman ſitting at the door, engaged in needle-work of ſome kind; and on the margin of a brook hard by, another charmer ſtood, angling for fiſh of ſome ſort: a garden appeared near the manſion that was well improved; and in the fields were ſheep and goats, horſes, and cows: cocks and hens, ducks and geeſe, were walking about the ground; and I could perceive a college of bees. The whole formed a charming ſcene.</p>

               <head>80. An account of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the valley I came into.</head>
               <p> Pleaſed with the view, and impatient to know who the two charmers were, I quite forgot the poor ſituation in which I left <hi>Tim,</hi> holding the horſes at the mouth of the cavern, on the dangerous ſide of ſo high a hill, and proceeded immediately to the houſe, as ſoon as I had recovered myſelf from a fall. My foot ſlipt in the paſſage, about ſix yards from the day, and I came rolling out of the mountain in a violent and ſurprizing manner. It was juſt mid-day when I came up to the ladies, and as they did not ſee me till they chanced to turn round, they were ſo amazed at my appearing, they changed colour, and one of them ſhrieked aloud; but this fright was ſoon over, on my aſſuring them that I was their moſt humble ſervant, and had againſt my will tumbled out of the hole that was at the bottom of that vaſt mountain before them. This I explained,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0028500100:420"/>and proteſted that I had not a thought of paying them a viſit, when curioſity led me into an opening near the top of the hill, as I was travelling on; but that when I did get through ſo wonderful a paſſage, and ſaw what was ſtill more ſtrange, when I arrived in the vale, to wit, two ladies, in ſo wild and ſilent a place, I judged it my duty to pay my reſpects, and aſk if you had any commands that I could execute in the world? This was polite, they ſaid, and gave me thanks; but told me, they had no favor to aſk than that I would dine with them, and inform them how it happened that I was obliged to travel over theſe ſcarce paſſable mountains, where there was no ſociety nor ſupport to be had. Beſide, if in riding here, you ſhould receive a miſchief, there was not a poſſibility of getting any relief. There muſt be ſomething very extraordinary ſurely, that could cauſe you to journey over ſuch frightful hills, and through the deep bottoms at the foot of them.</p>
               <p>Ladies (I replied), neceſſity and curioſity united are the ſpring that move me over theſe mountains, and enable me to bear the hardſhips I meet with in theſe ways. Forced from home by the cruelties of a ſtep-mother, and forſaken by my father on her account, I am wandering about the precipices of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſhire in ſearch of a gentleman, my Friend; to whoſe hoſpitable houſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0028500100:421"/>breaſt I ſhould be welcome, if I could find out where he lives in ſome part of this remote and deſolate region: and as my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity is more than ordinary, and I love to contemplate the works of nature, which are very grand and aſtoniſhing in this part of the world, I have gone many a mile out of my way while I have been looking for ſeveral days paſt for my friend, and have ventured into places where very few I believe would go. It was this taſte for natural knowledge that travelled me down the inſide of the mountain I am juſt come out of. If I had not had it, I ſhould never have known there was ſo delightful a little country here as what I now ſee: nor ſhould I have had the honor and happineſs of being known to you.</p>
               <p>But tell me, Sir, (one of theſe beauties ſaid) how have you lived for ſeveral days among theſe rocks and deſart places, as there are no inns in this country, nor a houſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this here, that we know? are you the favorite of the fairies and genies — or does the wiſe man of the hills bring you every night in a cloud to his home?</p>
               <p>It looks ſomething like it, madam, (I anſwering ſaid) and the thing to be ſure muſt appear very ſtrange: but it is like other ſtrange things: when the nature of them is known, they appear eaſy and plain. This
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0028500100:422"/>country I find conſiſts, for the moſt part, of ranges and groups of mountains horrible to behold, and of bogs, deep ſwampy narrow bottoms, and waters that fall and run innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ways: but this is not always the caſe: like the charming plain I am now on, there are many flowery and delicious exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pieces of ground, encloſed by vaſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding hills — the fineſt intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the mountains: the ſweeteſt interchange between hill and valley, I believe in all the world, is to be found in Richmondſhire, and in ſeveral of thoſe delightful vales I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered inhabitants as in this place: but the houſes are ſo ſeparated by fells ſcarce paſſable, and torrents of water, that thoſe who live in the centre of one group of mountains know not any thing of agreeable inhabitants that may dwell on the other ſide of the hills in an adjacent vale. If there had been a fine ſpot at the bottom of the precipice I found the opening in, and people living there, (as might have been the caſe) you ladies who live here, could have no notion of them, as you knew nothing of a paſſage from the foot to the ſummit of yonder mountain, within ſide of the vaſt hill, and if you did, would never venture to viſit that way; and as there is not a paſs in this chain of hills, to ride or walk through, to the other ſide of them: but the way out of this valley we are now
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0028500100:423"/>in, as I judge from the trending of the mountains all round us, muſt be an opening into ſome part of Cumberland. For this reaſon Stanemore hills may have ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies among them, tho' you have never heard of them, and I will now give you an account of ſome, who behaved in the moſt kind and generous manner to me. Here I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to relate ſome particulars concerning my friend <hi>Price</hi> and his excellent wife; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Mrs. <hi>Burcot</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Fletcher;</hi> the <hi>philoſophers</hi> who lived at <hi>Ulubrae,</hi> to whom I was returning; and the generous Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> and his excellent daughter, whom I left in the morning; and at whoſe houſe I arrived by travelling up the dark bowels of a tremendous mountain; as, on the contrary, I arrived at theirs by a deſcent through yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der frightful hill, till I came rolling out by a fall within, in a very ſurpriſing and comical way; a way that would have made you laugh, ladies; or, in a fright, cry out, if you had happened to be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the hole or opening in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of that hill, when, by a ſlip of my foot, in deſcending, a few yards from the day, I tumbled over and over, not only down what remained of the dark ſteep within, but the high ſloping bank that reaches from the the outſide of the opening to the firſt flat part of the vale. There is nothing wonderful
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0028500100:424"/>then in my living in this lone country for ſo many days. The only ſtrange thing is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the waters and ſwamps, that I was not drowned; or, an account of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices and deſcents I have been engaged on, that I did not break my neck, or my bones: but ſo long we are to live as Providence hath appointed for the accompliſhment of the grand divine ſcheme. Till the part allotted us is acted, we are ſecure. When it is done, we muſt go, and leave the ſtage for other players to come on.</p>
               <p>The ladies ſeemed greatly entertained with my hiſtories, and eſpecially with my tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of the mountain into their vale. They laughed very heartily; but told me, if they had happened to be ſitting near the hole, in the bottom of that tremendous rocky mountain, as they ſometimes did, and often wondered where the opening went to, and that I had come rolling down upon them, they would have been frightened out of their ſenſes; for they muſt have thought it a very ſtrange appearance: without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hiſtory of it, they muſt think it a prodigious occurrence, or exception from the conſtant affairs of nature.</p>
               <p>This might be, ladies, (I anſwered,) but from ſeeing me before your eyes you muſt own, that many things may be fact, which at firſt may ſeem to exceed the common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0028500100:425"/>of truth. Impoſſible or ſupernatural ſome people conclude many caſes to be that have not the leaſt difficulty in them, but happen to be made of occurrences and places they have not ſeen, nor heard the like of before. Things thought prodigious or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible by ignorance and weakneſs, will appear to right knowledge and a due judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very natural and accountable to the thoughts.</p>
               <p>Here a footman came up to us, to let his miſtreſs know that dinner was on the table, and we immediately went in to an excellent one. The ladies were very civil to me, and exerted a good humour to ſhew me, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that my arrival was not diſagreeable to them, tho' I tumbled upon their habitation, like the genie of the caverns, from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the mountains. They talked in an eaſy, rational manner, and aſked me many queſtions that ſhewed they were no ſtrangers to books and men and things: but at laſt it came to paſs, that the eldeſt of thoſe ladies, who acted as miſtreſs of the houſe, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be about one or two and twenty, deſired to know the name of the gentleman I was looking for among theſe hills, and called my friend. My reaſon, Sir, for aſking is, that you anſwer ſo exactly in face and perſon to a deſcription of a gentleman I heard not very
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0028500100:426"/>long ago, that I imagine it may be in my power to direct you right.</p>
               <p>Madam, (I replied), the gentleman I am in ſearch of is <hi>Charles Turner,</hi> who was my ſchoolfellow, and my ſenior by a year in the univerſity, which he left two years before I did, and went from <hi>Dublin</hi> to the north of <hi>England,</hi> to inherit a paternal eſtate on the deceaſe of his father. There was an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friendſhip between this excellent young man and me, and he made me promiſe him, in a ſolemn manner, to call upon him as ſoon as it was in my power; aſſuring me at the ſame time, that if by any changes and chances in this lower hemiſphere, I was ever brought into any perplexities, and he alive, I ſhould be welcome to him and what he had, and ſhare in his happineſs in this world, while I pleaſed. This is the man I want: a man, for his years, one of the wiſeſt and beſt of the race. His honeſt heart had no deſign in words. He ever ſpoke what he meant, and therefore, I am ſure he is my friend</p>
               <p>To this the lady anſwered, Sir, ſince <hi>Charles Turner</hi> is the man you want, your enquiry is at an end, for you are now at his houſe; and I, who am his ſiſter, bid you welcome to <hi>Skelſmore-Vale</hi> in his name. He has been for a year and a half laſt paſt in Italy, and a little before he went, gave me ſuch a deſcription of you as enabled me to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0028500100:427"/>gueſs who you were after I had looked a while at you, and he added to his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a requeſt to me, that if you ſhould chance to call here, while I happened to be in the country, that I would receive you, as if you were himſelf; and when I removed, if I could not, or did not chuſe to ſtay lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the country, that I would make you an offer of the houſe, and give you up all the keys of it, to make uſe of it and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the beſt things the place affords, till his return; which is to be, he ſays, in leſs than a year. Now, Sir, in regard to my brother and his friend, I not only offer you what he deſired I ſhould, but I will ſtay a month here longer than I intended; for this lady, (my couſin, <hi>Martha Jacquelot)</hi> and I, had determined to go to <hi>Scarborough</hi> next week, and from thence to <hi>London:</hi> nor is this all: as I know I ſhall the more oblige my brother the civiller I am to you, I will, when the Scarborough ſeaſon is over, if you chuſe to ſpend the winter here, come back to <hi>Skelſmore-Vale,</hi> and ſtay till Mr. Turner returns.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe aſtoniſhed me to the laſt degree — to hear that I was at my friend Turner's houſe, — he abroad, and to be ſo for another year: the poſſeſſion of his ſeat offered me; and his charming ſiſter ſo very civil and good, as to aſſure me ſhe would
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0028500100:428"/>return from the Spaw, and ſtay with me till her brother came home: theſe were things ſo unexpected and extraordinary, that I was for ſome time ſilent, and at a loſs what to ſay. I pauſed for ſome minutes, with my eyes faſtened on this beauty, and then ſaid — Miſs <hi>Turner,</hi> the account you have given of your brother, and the information that I am now at his houſe — his friendly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to me by you, and your prodigious ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, in reſolving to return from Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, to ſtay with me here till your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arrives, are things ſo ſtrange, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, and exceedingly generous and kind, that I am quite amazed at what I hear, and want words to expreſs my obligations, and the grateful ſenſe I have of ſuch favors. Accept my thanks, and be aſſured, that while I live, I ſhall properly remember the civility and benevolence of this day; and be ever ready, if occaſion offered, and the fates ſhould put it in my power, to make a due return. Your offer, madam, in particular, is ſo high an honour done me, and ſhews a ſpirit ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as I told you I was an unfortunate one, that I ſhall ever think of it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and mention it as a rare inſtance of female worth: but as to accepting theſe moſt kind offers, I cannot do it. Since Mr. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> is from home, I will go and viſit another friend I have in this country, to whom I
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0028500100:429"/>ſhall be welcome, I believe, till your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returns. To live by myſelf here at my friend's expence, would not be right, nor agreeable to me: and as to confining you, madam, in ſtaying with me, I would not do it for the world. Sir, (Miſs <hi>Turner</hi> replied) in reſpect of my ſtaying here, it will be no confinement to me, I aſſure you. My heart is not ſet upon going to London. It was only want of company made Miſs <hi>Jacquelot</hi> and me think of it, and if you will ſtay with us, we will not even go to Scarborough this ſeaſon. — This was goodneſs indeed: but againſt ſtaying longer than two or three days, I had many good reaſons that made it neceſſary for me to depart: beſide the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of my being an expence to Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> in his abſence, or confining his ſiſter to the country; there was <hi>Orton-Lodge,</hi> where I had left <hi>O Fin,</hi> my lad, at work, to which I could not avoid going again: and there was Miſs <hi>Melmoth,</hi> on whom I had promiſed to wait, and did intend to aſk her if ſhe would give me her hand, as I liked her and her circumſtances, and fanſied ſhe would live with me in any retreat I pleaſed to name; which was a thing that would be moſt pleaſing to my mind. It is true, if <hi>Charles Turner</hi> had come home, while I ſtayed at his houſe, it was poſſible I might have got his ſiſter, who was a very great
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0028500100:430"/>fortune: but this was an uncertainty how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and in his abſence, I could not in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour make my addreſſes to her: if it ſhould be againſt his mind, it would be acting a falſe part, while I was eating his bread: Miſs <hi>Turner</hi> to be ſure had fifty thouſand pounds at her own diſpoſal, and ſo far as I could judge of her mind, during the three days that I ſtayed with her at <hi>Skelſmore-Vale,</hi> I had ſome reaſon to imagine her heart might be gained: but for a man worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do this, in her brother's houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, was a part I could not act, tho' by miſſing her I had been brought to beg my bread. Three days then only I could be prevailed on to ſtay, and the time indeed was happily ſpent.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Miſs Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</label> Miſs <hi>Turner</hi> was good-humoured, ſenſible, and diſcreet, as one could wiſh a woman to be, talked pleaſantly upon common ſubjects, and was well acquainted with the three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt branches of polite learning, antiquity, hiſtory, and geography. It was a fine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to hear her. She likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood muſick, and ſung, and played well on the ſmall harpſichord: but her moral character was what ſhed the brighteſt luſtre on her ſoul. Her thoughts and words were ever employed in promoting God's glory, her neighbour's benefit, and her own true welfare; and her hand very often, in giving
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0028500100:431"/>to the poor. One third of her fine income ſhe devoted to the miſerable, and was in every reſpect ſo charitable, that ſhe never indulged the leaſt intemperance in ſpeaking. She deteſted that calumny and reproach which aſſaſſinates a credit, as much as ſhe abhorred the ſhedding a man's blood. The goodneſs of her heart was great indeed: the integrity of her life was glorious. She was perfection, ſo far as the thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the nature and ſtate of man here—as it was poſſible for a mortal to be exempt from blame in life, and blemiſh of ſoul. An abſolute exemption from faults cannot be the condition of any one in this world: But (to the ladies I now ſpeak), you may, like miſs <hi>Turner,</hi> be eminently good, if you will do your beſt to be perfect in ſuch a kind and degree as human frailty doth admit.</p>

Reaſon never loſt the command in her, nor ceaſed to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon whatever ſhe did. It ſecured her mind from being ever diſcompoſed, and diſengaged her life from the inconveniencies which a diſregard to reaſon expoſes us to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0028500100:432"/>By a management it dictated, ſhe enjoyed perpetual innocence and peace. She never uttered a word that intrenched upon piety, infringed charity, or diſturbed the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of any one, nor at any time ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaſt ſign of a vain and light ſpirit: yet ſhe had a ſportfulneſs of wit and fancy that was delightful, when ſhe could handſomely and innocently uſe it, and loved to exert the ſallies of wit in a lepid way, when they had no tendency to defile or diſcompoſe her mind, to wrong or harm the hearer, or her neighbour, or to violate any of the grand duties incumbent on us; piety, charity, juſtice, and ſobriety. Every thing that reaſon made unfit to be expreſſed, in relation to theſe virtues, ſhe always care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided; but otherwiſe, ſuch things excepted, would enliven and inſtruct by good ſenſe in jocular expreſſion, in a way the moſt charming and pleaſing. She was very wiſe, agreeable and happy. She was very good and worthy.</p>
               <p>This young lady was a great maſter on the fiddle, and very knowing in <hi>connoiſſance.</hi> She painted well, and talked in an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, for a woman, and for her years, of pictures, ſculpture, and medals.

               <head>83. A morning reflexion on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſun, and the Great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who created it.</head>
               <p> The ſun was riſing as we mounted the horſes, and ſtruck me ſo powerfully with the ſurpaſſing ſplendor and majeſty of its appearance, ſo cheared me by the gladſome influences, and intimate refreſhment of its all-enlivening beams, that I was contriving as I rid on an apology for the firſt adorers of the ſolar orb, and imagined they intended nothing more than the worſhip of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent majeſty of the inviſible Creator,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0028500100:434"/>under the ſymbol of his moſt <hi>excellent</hi> and nearly reſembling creature; and this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome <hi>imperfect</hi> tradition, that man, as a <hi>compound Being,</hi> had, in the beginning, a <hi>viſible glorious preſence</hi> of <hi>Jehovah Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> — a viſible exhibition of a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed preſence by an inexpreſſible brightneſs or glory: this is ſome excuſe for the firſt worſhippers of the ſolar orb: and when the thing conſecrated to the imagery and repreſentation of its Maker, became the rival of his honours, and from being a help to devotion, was advanced into the ſupreme object of it; yet conſidering the prodigious glory of this moving orb, and that all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated nature depends upon its <hi>auſpicious preſence,</hi> we cannot wonder that the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ruraliſts,</hi> without a <hi>creed,</hi> and without <hi>a philoſophy,</hi> ſhould be tempted to ſome warmer emotion than a merely ſpeculative admiration, and inclined to ſomething of immediate devotion. That univerſal chorus of joy that is manifeſted at the <hi>illuſtrious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities</hi> of opening ſun-ſhine, might tempt the weak to join in a ſeemingly-<hi>religious</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. At leaſt I am ſure there is much more to be ſaid for this ſpecies of idolatry, than for the <hi>papiſts</hi> worſhipping <hi>dead men, ſtocks, bones,</hi> and <hi>clouts.</hi> They have not only <hi>revelation</hi> expreſsly againſt them — <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0028500100:435"/>only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> (Matt. iv, 10.) — <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou ſet up any image or pillar.</hi> (Deut. xvi. 22.) But downright reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that the things are uſeleſs to the preſervers, and offenſive to God: whereas, on the contrary, when the eye beholds that glorious and important luminary of heaven, and conſiders the benefits diſpenſed to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the means of its moſt beautiful and invigorating beams, it might ſtrike not only an unpractiſed thinker, and cauſe the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, (who are not able of themſelves to raiſe their thoughts above their ſenſes, and frame a notion of an inviſible Deity), to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the bleſſings they received, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to this fanſied <hi>viſible exhibition</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: but even ſome of the wiſe ones who were a degree above the abſurdity of popular thinking, might be led to addreſs themſelves to the <hi>golden ſun, in ſplendor likeſt heaven.</hi> They might aſcribe the origin of their own exiſtence, and the world's, to this ſeemingly adequate cauſe, and genial power of the ſyſtem; when they beheld him returning again in the eaſt, (as I now ſee him) after the gloom and ſadneſs of the night; again the reſtorer of light and comfort, and the renewer of the world; <hi>regent of the day, and all th'horizon round, inveſted with bright rays;</hi> that all inferior nature, the earth's own form, and the ſupports of its animated inhabitants,

This (I imagine) may account for the earlieſt kind of idolatry; the worſhip paid to the ſun.

This is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural behaviour in all good parents, and we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the pious <hi>patriarch</hi> acted in this manner, when he ſent his relations away. But this <hi>oral tradition</hi> was liable to a gradual declenſion, and ſunk at laſt into a ſtate of evaneſcence.

It might remain pretty perfect, while <hi>Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nabor,</hi> and <hi>Terah,</hi> lived, as they had their informations from <hi>Noah,</hi> and were thoroughly adviſed to make God the object of their ſupreme love and fear, and truſt and worſhip; and to practiſe all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and righteouſneſs towards each other, as the great inſtruments and means of a general happineſs. With an earneſt tenderneſs, theſe things were recomended to them. But as the people who came after them never ſaw <hi>Noah,</hi> and their information depended on relators, who had it from relators, a dimneſs prevailed upon the antient facts, and diſtance and other objects overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed them. A depravation of tradition might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ariſe from relators forgetting material circumſtances, and from a miſapprehenſion of antient facts. There might likewiſe be many that deſignedly corrupted theſe facts, and out of a diſlike to truth, and a diſtaſte to virtue, did their beſt to weaken the principles of <hi>religion.</hi> Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious bad men there were among mankind then as well as in our time, and as there was no written ſyſtem and hiſtory to go by, they might give the antient ſtory a turn more favourable to ſinners.

                     <p>But through negligence, and falſe notions of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion brought in by impious men, corrupt cuſtoms, and prejudices of education, we find that not only virtue was loſt, ſoon after the diſperſion, but even the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Idolatry and wickedneſs prevailed for the greateſt part of the grand period of tradition, from the <hi>diſperſion</hi> to the imparting the <hi>knowledge of letters by Moſes.</hi> This ſhews the folly, vanity, and inconſiſtency of all tradition, and that for the ſupport of virtue, and true religion in the world, a <hi>written word</hi> is neceſſary. In the early ages of the poſtdiluvian world, religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was decayed, and we can trace the origin and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of idolatry very high. Even in <hi>Serug</hi>'s time, (who had received a compend of religion from <hi>Noah),</hi> when he became infirm by years, and was no longer able to inſpect the manners of his colony, and go about to take cognizance of their irregularities, we find the <hi>innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> had begun. We read in the <hi>books,</hi> that <hi>Terah,</hi> the father of <hi>Abraham</hi> was an <hi>idolater,</hi> in the 170th year of his age, which was the year that <hi>Serug</hi> died, and to be ſure, that was not the firſt year of his falſe religion: and it is not to be ſuppoſed, that when he went forth, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiper of falſe gods, from <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> his ſon, and <hi>Lot,</hi> etc. that the young people were ſafe from the infection. It prevailed before <hi>Abraham</hi> was warned to withdraw, and of conſequence he was one of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> that is an <hi>idolater.</hi> To me it is plain <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſays ſo. They all ſerved other gods. In all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that was beginning to be the caſe when <hi>Abraham</hi> was born, which was in the year after the flood 352; and as he was forty years old when his father marched him from <hi>Ur,</hi> we may think he was then a ſettled ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later: and if it had not been that the divine mercy call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by revelation to true-religion, he and the whole

The free grace of the univerſal Father took him and his poſterity into covenant, and uſed them as a mean to reſtore true piety and virtue to the world, till ſuch time as he was pleaſed to ſhew his aſtoniſhing mercy, and ineſtimable love in Chriſt Jeſus.

Thus might the novel impiety come on. They might, in the beginning, worſhip
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0028500100:441"/>the <hi>ſun</hi> as the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> appearing by a glorious light, or in a <hi>celeſtial train</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſence, which, at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, muſt appear in an indiſtinct, lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous viſion; but more generally, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God; an animated being, who had a principle of conſciouſneſs put into it; as the human body has, ſeated in it, a human ſoul; and that this glorious creature was enabled to perform the etherial journeys by its own underſtanding and will, and to make all lower nature happy by his benign and diffuſive influence; could ſee as far as he is ſeen, and every way was fitted for the noble work he had to execute. Thus did the <hi>ſun</hi> commence a God. He muſt, (they thought) from every appearance, in his wondrous, uſeful courſe, have the moſt exalted powers; be wiſe and benevolent, great and good. And when the worſhip of this luminary was once eſtabliſhed, it could not be long before the <hi>moon</hi> was <hi>deified:</hi> and then the <hi>ſtars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>conſervators</hi> of the univerſe. From thence idolatry went on, and added to the heavenly bodies the <hi>emblematic doctrine,</hi> and <hi>animal apotheoſis. Artificial fire</hi> was <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</hi> and made the <hi>ſymbol</hi> of <hi>ſidereal ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. Deity</hi> was exhibited to the multitude in the <hi>forms</hi> of its <hi>effects,</hi> and innumerable orders of inferior divinities by degrees ſprang up. Succeſſive enlargements of the ſyſtem
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0028500100:442"/>of <hi>natural apotheoſis</hi> prevailed; and, at laſt, the <hi>world,</hi> which ought only to have been regarded, as the magnificent <hi>theatre</hi> of <hi>divine perfections,</hi> was itſelf <hi>blaſphemouſly</hi> adored, as the <hi>independent proprietor</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>It is evident from hence that a <hi>reveled rule</hi> was wanting, or man had need of <hi>phyſics,</hi> to ſuppreſs the riſing tranſports of a too eager gratitude, and guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inclination to worſhip this riſing, lucid being, now ſo glorious before me; whoſe motion is ſo <hi>ſteady</hi> and <hi>uniform, ſwift, regular,</hi> and <hi>uſeful,</hi> that it ſeems to manifeſt itſelf a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi> being. Without the <hi>lights</hi> of <hi>philoſophers,</hi> or the <hi>ſupernatural aſſiſtance</hi> of religion, it was hard for recent and wondering mortals, to refrain from worſhiping that beautiful body, as they ſaw it proceeded with the greateſt harmony, and ſhed innumerable bleſſings on them. But <hi>pure reveled religion</hi> diffuſes ſuch a light as manifeſts the error: and a <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>philoſophic</hi> reaſoning, (in this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> age the <hi>ſafe guide,</hi> and <hi>proper arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator</hi> of religion) not only refuſes to addreſs itſelf to that God of the antient popular theology, but proves the worſhip impious and abſurd.</p>

               <p>And eſpecially, when from the earth I lift up my eyes to the heavens, and behold among the wonders of the firmament, that vaſt and magnificent orb, the ſun now riſing before me, brightning by degrees the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and pouring the whole flood of day upon us; the wonderful and grand ſcene ſtrikes powerfully on my mind, and cauſes an awful impreſſion. With ſentiments of the greateſt admiration, I conſider the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious object, and feel the kindly heat of that bright luminary, inſpiring me with more than uſual gladneſs. And what power is it that ſupplies this fountain of light and heat, with his genial and inexhauſted trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure — who diſpenſes it with ſuch muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, yet wiſe profuſion? It muſt be ſome Almighty Being. It muſt be the work of the Deity, that is, the powerful, wiſe, and good Parent of mankind, the Maker, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and Ruler of the world; for his perfections are ſtampt upon the work. The
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0028500100:444"/>evidence of reaſon declares it. Chance or neceſſity cannot form or guide. An active underſtanding only, and intending cauſe, can produce, and direct: and this cauſe, muſt be all-ruling wiſdom, and unlimited power, in conjunction with the moſt amiable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is plain to a thorough and rational examination. A ſupreme Being, an eternal ſelf-exiſtent mind, who comprehends and preſides over all, muſt impart the benefits of that glorious creature before me, uſing it as an inanimate, unconſcious, inſtrument of conveying light, heat, and prolific influences to the <hi>earth;</hi> which, by infinite power, is rendered as much active in ſending the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gete juices through the veſſels of all plants, as the ſun is in diffuſing its rays upon the ſurface of the globe we inhabit. The <hi>ſun,</hi> and <hi>moon,</hi> and <hi>ſtars,</hi> are but inſtruments in his hand, for bringing about mechanically whatever good effects he has created them to produce. Our <hi>holy religion</hi> and <hi>philoſophic</hi> reaſoning evince this truth. This glorious ſun bears the ſignatures of its author, and the finger of God is diſcernible every where. The wiſdom and loving-kindneſs of the Lord are viſible, whatever way we turn. His bounty appears by its conſtant, yet vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary communication, and is the more to be admired as it is a never-failing principle. This riſing luminary that viſits our earth, is,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0028500100:445"/>in particular, a daily freſh inſtance of the divine favor; and did not God's goodneſs only, prevent its ſuſpenſion, we ſhould be involved in the utmoſt horror, nay, inevitable ruin: and when, in the evening it leaves us overſpread by the darkneſs, to viſit others with its benign influences; the change is charming, for night gives man a neceſſary vacation from the labours of the day. In ſleep he takes the ſweeteſt refreſhment, till this riſing ſun, by the beneficent direction of its great Author, again appears in grace and ſplendor, and diſplays the face of nature in unſpeakable beauties. Every where the bounty of the ſupreme Spirit I ſee diffuſed; through air, through earth, and in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p> In this manner were my thoughts employed, as we rid over the brows of many high hills, with the riſing ſun before me, till we deſcended to a narrow wet bottom, which trended due weſt for an hour, and brought us to the foot of another high mountain. This we aſcended with the horſes as far as it was poſſible to bring them, and from thence I climbed up to the top, by a ſteep craggy way, near 200 yards. This was very difficult and dangerous, but I had an enchanting proſpect, when I gained the ſummit of the hill. A valley near a mile in breadth appeared betwixt the oppoſite moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and that on which I ſtood; and a river was running through it, that ſpread ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into little lakes, and ſometimes fell headlong from the rocks in ſounding caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades. The fineſt meadows, and little thickets, bordered thoſe waters on every ſide, and beyond them the vaſt hills had a fine effect in the view: ſome were covered with foreſt; and ſome with precipitating ſtreams. I was charmed with this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of the beauties of nature. It is a more delightful landſcape than art has been able to form in the fineſt gardens of the world.</p>

               <p> But when I came near the manſion, no human creature could I ſee, nor, for ſome time, could I find an entrance any way. The gate of the garden in which the houſe ſtood was faſt, and ſo was every window and door: but as the gardens were in fine order, and full of fruits, vegetables, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I knew it muſt be an inhabited place, tho' its people were from home. With my pole therefore I leaped a deep moat, which ſurrounded the garden, and for half an hour continued walking about it, pulling ſome things, and looking at others, in hopes that ſome one might be ſeen: no ſoul how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appeared, and I was going to return to
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0028500100:448"/>my horſes, when, by accident, I came to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of ſtairs, that was planted round with ſhade of laurel, ever-green, and branching palm. Down I went immediately. I walked thro' a long arched paſſage, in which two lamps were burning, and at the end of it came to an open door, that admitted me into an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which led to a flight of ſtairs. Should I go any farther, was the queſtion? If any one within, I might greatly offend: and if it was the habitation of rogues, I might find myſelf in a pound. What ſhall I do then? Go on, (ſays curioſity) and bravely finiſh the adventure.</p>
               <p>Softly then I aſcended, liſtening, by the way, if I could hear any voice, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upwards, to the firſt floor. A door was there open, and on my tiptoes I went to look in: but, all I could ſee was a room well furniſhed, and through it I paſſed to another, which was likewiſe full of fine things, and had a door unlocked, that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a large library. The books were all bound in vellum, in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the collection valuable, and moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ordered. Mathematical inſtruments of all Sorts were on a table, and every thing looked as belonging to a ſcholar and man of fortune. Great was my amazement, as I ſaw no living creature. I knew not what to think of all theſe things: nor did my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment diminiſh, when I went from the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0028500100:449"/>library into two very handſome bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſaw in one of them the apparel of a woman; in the other the dreſs of a man.</p>
               <p>Muſing on theſe matters, and looking over the books, I continued near an hour, when I turned round to depart, and ſaw at the door of the library I was in, a gentleman, and two young ladies in riding-dreſſes, who ſeemed more than amazed at the ſight of me. The man's face I knew very well, and ſoon remembred he was one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that came over with me from <hi>Ireland</hi> in the <hi>Skinner and Jenkins,</hi> and a perſon I had thought a very odd man; for he never ſtirred out of his birth all the while he was on board, nor ſpoke a ſyllable to any one, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept myſelf; and that only for a couple of hours after we landed; when he was pleaſed to ſingle me out, and requeſted we might dine together; to which I ſaid, with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Sir, and he came with miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> and me to our inn. With us he ſat for the time I have ſaid, and talked like a man of ſenſe and virtue. He was but three or four years older than I was, and yet ſo very grave, that in reſpect of temper, he was fit for the bench. He told me, he lived in too remote a place, ever to expect to ſee me in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but he had a houſe in London, where he was every winter, if not hindered by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to a part of it I ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0028500100:450"/>if it was agreeable to me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our acquaintance. Many other civil things he ſaid, and ſhewed a regard for me that I little expected, and could not but wonder at. All this made me as well known to him as he was remembred by me; but he looked as it were ſcared at the ſight of me, in the place I now appeared in; where I ſtood leaning on my long pole (when he came to the cloſet door), and was reading out the following lines in a book I chanced to take into my hand; to which I added a few reflexions:</p>

               <p> This paſſage and reflexion pronounced very loud, with an enthuſiaſm that ſeizes me when I take a claſſic in my hand, added greatly to the aſtoniſhment of finding me in the cloſet, and for ſome time the gentleman was not able to ſpeak, or come forward; but
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0028500100:452"/>at laſt, moving towards me, as I did to him, the moment I ſaw him, he ſaid, by what ſtrange chance have I the favor of ſeeing you here? Inform me, I beſeech you, in the name of friendſhip, what ſurprizing acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent has thrown you on this ſolitude; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horſe or ſervant — and how did you get over the broad moat of water, as the two garden gates were locked?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Berrisfort</hi> (I anſwered), you may well wonder at ſeeing me in this remote and ſilent part of the world, and eſpecially at my being in your ſtudy, without either horſe or attendant in waiting, that you could find, on coming home; but the thing was all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in the common courſe of events, as you ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>Three weeks after you left me at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,</hi> I ſet out from that place for Brugh under Stanemore, and went from thence up the northern mountains, in ſearch of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman I had ſome buſineſs with, who lives but a few miles beyond you, and on my return from his houſe, as the road lay very high on the ſide of yonder vaſt hill, I quitted my horſe out of curioſity, to climb up to the top of the mountain, and ſee what kind of country lay on the other ſide of this long range of high hills. It was with great difficulty I got up to the pike, and few, perhaps, but myſelf, would attempt it: I was rewarded however by the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0028500100:453"/>fine proſpect, and ſeeing the deſcent on this ſide eaſy, and a houſe and large gardens before me, I could not refrain from going down to the bottom. I marched on to take a view of the manſion and improvements, and as I ſaw ſome ver fine things in the gardens, and no ſign of any living creature; the gates ſhut, and every place to appearance faſtened, I leaped the moat with this pole, and after I had wandered about the ground, by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent came to the ſhady encloſure, in which I found the deſcending ſtairs from the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and ſeeing the lamps burning in the paſſage, could not avoid going down, and proceeded till I arrived at this fine library. My admiration was great, you may be ſure, and the books too ſtrong a temptation for me not to mind them. With great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I looked into many of them, and at laſt opened the Greek writer I was reading out, when you came to the door of your ſtudy. Such were the cauſes that brought me where you find me.</p>
               <p>(Mr. <hi>Berrisfort</hi> replied): Sir, I am glad there was any thing in the force and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of caſualties, that could bring you to my houſe, and I aſſure you upon my word, that you are moſt heartily welcome. As I lay in my cabbin on ſhip-board, I conceived a great regard for you, on account of many
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0028500100:454"/>things I heard you ſay, and particularly, for your lively arguments with Dr. <hi>Whaley,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtorm began, in defence of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Unity,</hi> and againſt that <hi>miſerable theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> which the <hi>monks</hi> have invented, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſupport, tho' it militates with the reveled truths of God, and the reaſon and fitneſs of things. I was greatly pleaſed with your different definitions of churchiſm and religion, and honoured you not a little for what you ſaid in oppoſition to unintelligible myſtery, and the glare of ceremony; at the ſame time, that you contended for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the univerſal Father, and that ſober, righteous, and godly life, which ſprings from the love of truth, virtue, and moral rectitude. Once more then I aſſure you, Sir, I am moſt heartily glad to ſee you, and I ſhall take it as a great favour if you will paſs the ſummer with me in this wild coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try place. Every thing ſhall be made as agreeable as poſſible, and, excluſive of this cloſet of books, which you ſhall poſſeſs while you ſtay here, we will hunt, and ſet, and ſhoot, and enjoy all the pleaſures of the field: but in the mean time, as it is now ten o'clock, we ought to think of breakfaſt, and he deſired his ſiſter, a moſt charming creature, to call for it immediately, and I ſoon ſaw ſeveral ſervants bring in every thing that was elegant and excellent. He told me
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:0028500100:455"/>I need be under no uneaſineſs about my mare and horſes, for there was a ſteep narrow way for them to come down to his ſtables, about half a mile from the place I left them, and he would immediately ſend one of his ſervants to bring them.</p>
               <p>This was vaſtly civil and affectionate, and I told Mr. <hi>Berrisfort,</hi> that I was under great obligations to him for his goodneſs, which I ſhould ever have an extreme ſenſe of, but I was obliged to go on upon buſineſs: a few days however I would enjoy the happineſs he offered me, and we paſſed them in a very delightful manner.</p>

There was no being dull with ſuch people, in ſuch a place. I have ſeen very few young ladies in my time that I liked better than thoſe girls.

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0028500100:458"/>mare again, and by Miſs <hi>Berrisfort</hi>'s ſide. She laughed immoderately at me, while the dogs were at fault, as my bones were ſafe, and adviſed me with a humorous tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ride with her brother and Miſs <hi>Fox.</hi> It was not however very long before I had more ſatisfaction than I deſired; for in half an hour's time, we came to ſome pales, which the ſtag went over, and I leaped firſt; but Miſs <hi>Berrisfort</hi>'s horſe, tho' one of the beſt in the world, unfortunately ſtruck, and cleared them in ſuch a manner, that the lovely <hi>Juliet</hi> came over his head. She fell very ſafely in high graſs, where I waited for her, for fear of an accident of any kind, and did not receive the leaſt hurt; but in the violence of the motion, and the way ſhe came down, the curtain was thrown on her breaſt, and ſhe lay for ſome moments ſtunn'd upon the ground. In a minute however I ſnatched her up, and ſet her on her feet. She came to herſelf immediately, and thanked me for my care of her; but was vexed to the heart at what had happened. She requeſted I would not mention the thing to her brother, or Miſs <hi>Fox,</hi> and hoped I would be ſo generous as not to ſpeak of it to any one. — Miſs <hi>Berrisfort</hi> (I ſaid) it is not in my ſoul to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a mirth from the bad fortune of any one; and much leſs is it in my power to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, or laugh at a woman of diſtinction,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0028500100:459"/>for an accident like this. You may believe me, when I promiſe you, upon my word, and ſwear it by every ſacred thing, that I will not ſo much as hint it to any mortal while you remain in this world. This gave her ſome relief, and by her foot in my hands, I lifted her into her ſaddle again. — Two benefits were from this miſchance derived.

This is juſt. But excluſive of this, may we not ſay, that there are ſo many ſeeming contradictions, and a multiplicity of obſcure paſſages in it, that it looks as if it could not be, in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, a rule of faith: and that chriſtians differ ſo much about the meaning of the texts of their bible, that reaſon knows not what to ſay to a religion ſo variouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. It is not only the two great camps, <hi>papiſt</hi> againſt <hi>proteſtant,</hi> and <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:0028500100:461"/>againſt <hi>papiſt,</hi> who make the religion as different as black and white: that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed miſſion</hi> at <hi>Malabar</hi> tell the <hi>Indians</hi> they muſt not hearken to the jeſuits, if they expect ſalvation; and the <hi>monks</hi> at <hi>Coroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> declare, on the contrary, to thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> that they will be damned to eternity, if they are converted to what the Daniſh miniſters call chriſtianity; which made the famous <hi>bramin Padmanaba</hi> ſay, that it was impoſſible for him to become a chriſtian, till the learned chriſtian prieſts had agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what chriſtianity was; for he had not erudition and judgment enough to decide in the intricate controverſy: but, excluſive of this, proteſtants are ſo divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even the church of England againſt the church of England—diſſenters againſt diſſenters — and give ſuch different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the reveled ſyſtem, that it requires more underſtanding, and ſtrict, ſerious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, than the generality of people have, or can ſpare, to be able to determine in what party of the celebrated critics and expoſitors true religion is to be found: and when the controverſy is ſo dark and various, and the authorized profeſſors can never agree among themſelves, what can a man of a plain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſay to it? This makes many (I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) turn from the ſcriptures to ſtudy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the general laws which are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0028500100:462"/>among the ſeveral gradations, ranks and claſſes of beings, ſo far as they are connected with intelligent, moral agency. In the natural, agreeable pages of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite volume, we ſee and perceive beauty and order, art, wiſdom, and goodneſs, and are thereby led to the Creator and Governor of the world, the univerſal cauſe, preſerver, and director of nature. We diſcover his providence, meaſures and benevolence, the rules and principles of eternal, immutable wiſdom and reaſon, and by them are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to confeſs a univerſal, intelligent Efficient; one infinite, eternal, omnipotent, wiſe, good Being, from whom all others derive, and on whom all others neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily depend, and that continually. In ſhort, by ſtudying nature, we diſcover a God of truth, order and rectitude, and as we find perfect univerſal truth, and moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to be the higheſt perfection in the Deity, our reaſon informs us, that we ought to ſhew our love of God, by a love of theſe; and that a regular, uniform purſuit of them, muſt be the only true and rational purſuit of human happineſs. Here is a plain and good religion. Can we wonder then that many ſtudy and follow nature, and diſregard thoſe intereſted commentators, who, like oppoſite counſel at the bar, multiply and make void the law by different and contradictory plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on it? — Here <hi>Bob</hi> ended, and lit
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:0028500100:463"/>his pipe again, while <hi>Jack</hi> laid his down, and went on in the following manner:</p>

                     <label>An apology for true chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</label> As chriſtianity was inſtituted by its great Author and Publiſher, for the benefit of mankind, it is to be lamented that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſhould ſo differ, concerning what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine reveled religion is, as to cauſe many to renounce this ſtanding and perpetual rule of faith and manners: but as to contradictions and inconſiſtencies in the apoſtle's writings, I have read them over ſeveral times, and never could find ſuch things in them. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure paſſages there are a few at firſt ſight; but a little conſideration can explain them by other ſcriptures, if we do no, like ſome commentators, endeavour, by forced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, to adapt the ſenſe of them to a ſyſtem. This is what ruins chriſtianity. The monks ſhut out the light of reaſon, which is to explain ſcripture by ſcripture, and in the dark, fanſy a <hi>metaphyſical theology:</hi> They ſpeculate a <hi>tritheiſtic myſtery, original ſin, divine ſovereignty, election, reprobation,</hi> with many other pieties, and call the things <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> which are, in <hi>reality,</hi> an <hi>artificial, invented corruption of the goſpel.</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the doctors inſiſt upon it that their reverend notions are reveled religion, and where they have a power, wattle the people into them: but men who will uſe the <hi>human underſtanding</hi> their Creator has given
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:0028500100:464"/>them, and employ the reaſon of men in the choice of their religion, very eaſily perceive that <hi>unnatural repreſentation</hi> could never come down from heaven; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the declaimers on human nature may ſay in praiſe of their goſpel, it is impoſſible it ſhould be inſpiration, when the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions rather merit laughter and contempt than the attention of rational creatures. This makes the Indians of any underſtanding flee chriſtianity. This cauſes men of ſenſe, in a free country, to declare againſt reveled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The principal <hi>offence</hi> muſt remain, while the majority of the clergy continue to blind the human underſtanding, and inſtead of couching the cataract, darken the ſouls of the people with a ſuffuſion of myſtery: to which I may add, and obſtinately refuſe to make uſe of <hi>unexceptionable, ſcriptural</hi> forms of expreſſion in divine public ſervice, though an alteration might be made without any poſſible danger or injury to the church, and continue to uſe in our liturgy <hi>unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> phraſes, and <hi>metaphyſical</hi> notions, the imaginations of weak men. While this is done, the chriſtian religion muſt ſuffer, and of conſequence, the <hi>divines</hi> who contend for myſtery, and labour to deſtroy human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the powers thereof; to ſtifle and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh our common notions of things, and preclude all reaſoning whatſoever upon the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0028500100:465"/>ſubject of religion; muſt have the blood of more ſouls to anſwer for, in the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day of calamity, than they now ſeem to imagine, while great preferments blind their underſtanding, and render them inſolent and poſitive. All this however has nothing to do with the true goſpel. If men would read the hiſtorical, and the argumentative parts of the ſacred writings with honeſty, and explain them as right reaſon and true criticiſm directs; if they would ſtudy them with that true zeal, which is guided by a good light in the head, and which conſiſts of good and innocent affections in the heart; and have at the ſame time a knowledge of the cuſtoms which prevailed, and the notions that were commonly received in thoſe diſtant ages and countries, they would find no inconſiſtencies and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſcriptures: even the difficulties would ſoon diſappear. The ſacred writings would appear to be what they are — a ſyſtem of religion that anſwers to all our wiſhes and deſires: — that requires of us that obedience to which as rational beings we are antecedently bound; and offers us rewards for obeying more than nature could ever claim. In the goſpel, we have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of nature in perfection, and with it a certainty of mercy and unutterable bleſſings: but in natural religion, as the reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of men can collect it, our hopes
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0028500100:466"/>of pardon and glory have but uncertain foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Without revelation, our hopes are liable to be diſturbed and ſhaken by frequent doubts and miſgivings of mind: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled religion, that is, the moral law repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by inſpired men, the promiſes of the goſpel take in all the wiſhes of nature, and eſtabliſh all her hopes. Bleſſed be God then for ſending his well-beloved Son into the world. From him we have a law that is holy, and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good: and by a dutiful ſubmiſſion to this plain and perfect law, (in which there is <hi>no myſtery, no inconſiſtency, no contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)</hi> we are delivered from condemnation by the grace of God through Chriſt. Here is reaſon for adoring the divine goodneſs. The goſpel gives a better evidence for the truth and certainty of life and immortality than nature before had given, and thereby diſplays the love that God has for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>Berrisfort</hi> ſaid, that he thought my plea for original chriſtianity was good, and allowed it was not the goſpel that was faulty in myſtery and obſcurity, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and inconſiſtency; but, human ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and human vanity, which have load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with abſurdities, while they excluded reaſoning about it, and warped its fair and heavenly maxims to the intereſts of ſyſtems
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0028500100:467"/>and temporalities. However (Bob conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued), you will allow, I believe, that the ſacred writers had not perpetually the aid of an unerring Spirit, and therefore are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inconſiſtent in their accounts: that as they were ſometimes deſtitute of divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, they were liable to error when guided only by the human ſpirit, and did act like common men upon ſeveral occaſions. This ſeems to be evident from the relations, and the human ſentiments of the apoſtles. The evangeliſts ſpeak of the ſame facts dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently; and in citing prophecy, while one adapts a fact to the letter of the prophecy, another accommodates the letter of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to the letter of the fact: I mean here, the <hi>aſs and colt</hi> in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the <hi>colt</hi> only in <hi>John,</hi> and their citing <hi>Zechariah</hi> (ix. 9.) differently. And as to the other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writers, does not the diſpute between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhew a ſubjection, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to ignorance and error? does not the quarrel between <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> let us ſee, that one of them was miſtaken, and both of them to be blamed? Tell me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what you think of <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s different accounts of the time of the crucifix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion — and does not <hi>Matthew</hi> contradict <hi>Mark</hi> in his relation of the reſurrection of Jeſus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jack Buncle</hi> to this replied, that however ſome zealots may contend for the perpetual inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0028500100:468"/>of the ſacred writers, yet he could not think ſuch doctrine neceſſary to the creed of a chriſtian: <hi>Jeſus</hi> only is called <hi>the truth,</hi> and was incapable of error. <hi>Chriſt</hi> only, in all his actions, was directed by a prophetic ſpirit. All other men, prophets and apoſtles, were ſometimes left to the guidance of their own ſpirit; and therefore all things which they have ſignified to us by their words or deeds, are not to be conſidered as divine oracles. <hi>Nec adeo omnia, quaecunque dictis ſignificarunt aut factis, ea pro divinis oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis habenda.

His New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, letters, and colloquies, are the moſt valuable of his works. The preface to his paraphraſe on the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of St. Matthew is an admirable thing. An Engliſh tranſlation of it, with notes, and a good preliminary diſcourſe addreſſed to the catholics, was printed for Cooper in Pater-noſter Row, 1749.</p>

He was confined in the King's-Bench priſon from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1685, to the 24th of November 1686; when, by the mediation of Lord Powis, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a pardon from King <hi>James,</hi> and was diſcharged out of priſon.</p>
                     <p>The paſſages picked out by <hi>Sir Roger l'Eſtrange,</hi> were his explications of <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 19. — <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 39.—<hi>Mark</hi> xi. 31.—<hi>Mark</hi> xii. 38, 39, 40. — <hi>Luke</hi> x. 2. — <hi>John</hi> xi. 57. and <hi>Act</hi> xv. 2.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>South</hi> likewiſe, (as I have heard) put into his enemies hands ſome accuſations out of <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. The charge was, that his paraphraſe on theſe places reflected on the prelates of the church of England, and ſo he was guilty of ſedition: but equity at this day can find no ſuch reflexion or ſedition in the paſſages.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was born November 12, 1615, at Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in South Bradford: and died at his houſe in Charter-houſe-yard, the 8th of December, 1691, aged 76. He was an author 52 years, and in that time writ 145 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct treatiſes; whereof four were folios, 73 quartos, 49 octavos, and 19 in twelves and twenty-fours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſingle ſheets, ſeparate ſermons, and prefaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other men's writings. He began with <hi>aphoriſms</hi> of <hi>juſtification,</hi> in 1649, in his 34th year; and ended with the <hi>certainty of the world of ſpirits,</hi> in 1691; the year he died.</p>

live as you pray, and that power, which darkens the underſtanding, enſlaves the will, and obſtructs the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of conſcience, you may eaſily remove. You will deſpiſe every gratification againſt truth, and delight in being uſeful and pious here, that you may ſecure eternal happineſs in ſome future world. Ponder then, <hi>rationals,</hi> in time. As you are placed here in a mutable condition, capable of bliſs and miſery; — to be made <hi>confirmed bleſſed ſpirits</hi> above, when the time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is over, if you have kept the commandments of God;—or, to live with <hi>Lucifer</hi> and the <hi>apoſtates</hi> for ever in <hi>darkneſs</hi> and <hi>woe,</hi> if you have not fought the good fight, and kept the faith; — therefore, do all that piety and goodneſs can do in this life. Reſolve by the advice of the goſpel, and let nothing in nature be able to divert the execution, but a countermand from the ſame authority.</p>
                           <p>I ſpeak to the rich and gay that frequent <hi>Vauxhall</hi> and <hi>Ranelagh;</hi> for as to the people who reſort to the ſix-penny gardens, they are incapable of being adviſed: the women there are for the moſt part ſtreet whores, and the greateſt part of the men, pickpockets and gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers: nor do they keep themſelves ſober; for, the laſt time I looked into one of their dancing-rooms, (to ſee how it was with my kind, at 9 o'clock at night, as I was walking home), I ſaw ſome of the men ſuddled, —fighting for the women; and ſeveral unhappy girls, ſo drunk, they could not ſtand. The whole was a ſad ſcene.</p>
                           <p>But you, who are great, honourable, and rational, may be called on, I ſuppoſe, to ſtop every wandering or illicit thought, every inconſiderate word, and to bring every intended action before the ſupreme bar of righteous and impartial reaſon.

                     <p>The chriſtian world is greatly obliged to this learned and excellent man for the following fine books by him written.

but a long and curious hiſtory of the life of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius.</hi> The life was afterwards tranſlated into Latin, and may be had in octavo. It is an admirable thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Courcelles</hi> was born in the year 1586, and died the 29th of May, 1659, aged 73. He ſucceeded <hi>Simon Epiſcopius</hi> as paſtor to the church of the remonſtrants in Holland, and was ſucceeded in that charge by <hi>Arnold Poelemburg;</hi> who writ his life. This life is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing, but is only to be found at the beginning of his works, publiſhed, as before ſaid, by <hi>Limborch,</hi> in 1675.</p>
                     <p>The beſt thing of <hi>Courcelles</hi> is his <hi>quaternio diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum theologicarum:</hi> in which he treats, as an able, rational divine, of the trinity, original ſin, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and juſtification. — The next in value to this, are his <hi>inſtitutiones religionis chriſtianae: — Diatribe de eſu ſanguinis: — vindiciae contra Amyraldum:</hi> and <hi>avis d'un perſonnage deſintereſſe;</hi> in which he acted the Mediator between the Calviniſts and Arminians; but without ſucceſs. It is a vain attempt to unite parties. Every party is a church, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in its own conceit. Happy they that are of no party; but <hi>devoted</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt only,</hi> and his <hi>plane goſpel;</hi> doing their beſt to be <hi>pure and good, even as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was pure and good</hi> — and <hi>worſhiping God the Father Almighty, in the name of Jeſus, as his diſciples;</hi> without ſpeculating, inventing, or perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves with imaginations. This was our Lord's direction. When you pray, ſay, <hi>Our Father — whatever ye aſk in my name — without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Here it is, <hi>gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>laity,</hi> as the doctors call us, and will have us to be an <hi>inferior tribe</hi> to them. Adhere to theſe few, plain things, and

                        <hi>Simon Epiſcopius,</hi> a remonſtrant miniſter at Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, a glorious man, was born in the year 1583, and died of a retention of urine, the 4th of April, 1643, aged 60.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arnold</hi> was a learned, eloquent, and pious man. His <hi>diſſertatio epiſtolaris contra Hoornbeekium</hi> — and his <hi>examen Theſium Spanhemii,</hi> are fine things. His <hi>preface to the ſecond volume of Epiſcopius's theological works,</hi> is excellent: and in a valuable book called <hi>epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolae praeſtantium virorum,</hi> you will find many letters by <hi>Poelenburgh,</hi> that are extremely beautiful, in reſpect of the charms of his ſtile, and his judicious manner of treating his ſubjects.</p>

good for nothing: and all of them written with great perplexity; without any beauty of ſtile, or any order. Dodwell's learning was very great, but beſide the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of his notions, (which he affected), his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lay like a lump of puzzeled ſilk in his head, and he could draw few uſeful threads. In the 2d volume of this journal, and in the 2d volume of the memoirs of ſome ladies of Great-Britain, the reader will find ſeveral remarks on Dodwell's pieces.</p>
                     <p>Note, in the 52d year of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s age, he married a very young girl, the daughter of a gentleman, in whoſe houſe he boarded in the country; having been her preceptor for five years, from a regard to her fine underſtanding; and by her had ten children. Two ſons and four daughters ſurvived him, and one of the ſons is the preſent <hi>rector</hi> of <hi>Shottesbrook,</hi> well known by the title of <hi>orthodox Dodwell,</hi> on account of his writings for the fathers againſt Dr. <hi>Middleton;</hi> and to diſtinguiſh him from the author of a bad book, finely written, called, <hi>chriſtianity not founded on argument.</hi>

They aſſert, that the apoſtles,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0028500100:469"/>on ordinary occaſions, were ordinary men. All true chriſtian critics muſt allow this, and grant that, the univerſal inſpiration of the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:0028500100:470"/>ſacred penmen, is a notion founded in the prejudices of pious men and their miſtaken ſenſe of ſcripture. Such infallible authority
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0028500100:471"/>they think the beſt way to ſilence all objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and weakly embrace the hypotheſis to advance the honour of religion.</p>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:0028500100:472"/>
               <p>But our allowing this, and that there are ſome diſagreements and variations in the evangeliſts, cannot hurt the goſpel. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:0028500100:473"/>might <hi>reprove St. Peter,</hi> and ſpeak himſelf ſometimes <hi>after the manner of men;</hi> yet, we ſee where they had the divine aſſiſtance in
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0028500100:474"/>their explications, and the power of working miracles to confirm their doctrine; and there, as rational and thinking men, we muſt allow
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0028500100:475"/>the authority of the ſacred books: the few places that have the marks of weakneſs, only ſerve to convince us, that the divine writers
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0028500100:476"/>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:0028500100:477"/>of the <hi>books</hi> made not the leaſt pretenſion to perpetual inſpiration. <hi>In ſuo ſenſu abundat — aliquid humanae fragilitatis diſſentio ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet:</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:0028500100:478"/>(ſays <hi>Jerome.)</hi> Human frailty and their own ſenſe honeſtly appear, when there was not an occaſion for infallibility and miracle. But whenever the preachers of the New Teſtament were wanted for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary purpoſes of divine providence,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0028500100:479"/>they were made ſuperior to the infirmities of nature: their underſtandings were enlarged
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0028500100:480"/>and inlightened and an inſpired knowledge rendered them incapable of error. This, in my judgment, is ſo far from ruining the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0028500100:481"/>of ſcipture, that it is the greateſt confirmation of its truth. It ſhews the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of the preachers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0028500100:482"/>in owning they were only occaſionally inſpired: and when the incredulous ſee the ingenuous acknowledgment of what is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:0028500100:483"/>in the inſpired writings, the truth of our religion muſt be more conſpicuous to their eyes: whereas the truths of the Teſtament
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0028500100:484"/>are hid from them, by making God the dictator of the whole; becauſe they think that impoſſible, and therefore conclude, the chriſtian religion has no better foundation. In ſhort, there is no reaſon to believe that the apoſtles were extraordinarily inſpired, when they ſay it not; and when their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes have in them no mark of ſuch like inſpiration. It is ſufficient, (ſays <hi>Le Clerc),</hi> if we believe that, no prophet of the New Teſtament has ſaid any thing in the name of God, or by his order, which God has not effectually ordered him to ſay; nor has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to foretell any thing, which God
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0028500100:485"/>had not indeed truly reveled to him:— that every matter of fact related in the <hi>books</hi> is true, and the records, in general, the trueſt and moſt holy hiſtory that ever was publiſhed amongſt men, notwithſtanding the writers may be miſtaken in ſome ſlight cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: — that all the doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed are really and truly divine doctrines, and there is no ſort of reaſoning in the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical places of the holy ſcriptures, that can lead us into error, or into the belief of any thing that is falſe, or contrary to piety:— that Jeſus Chriſt was abſolutely infallible, as well as free from all ſin, becauſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head that was always united to him, and which perpetually inſpired him; inſomuch, that all he taught is as certain as if God himſelf had pronounced:— and in the laſt place, that God did often dictate to the apoſtles the very words which they ſhould uſe. Theſe five heads are enough to believe. We allow in theſe things the authority of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and they who affirm more are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                     <p>Note, reader, theſe five letters were tranſlated into Engliſh in 1690, and make a very little 12ves, that ſells for five ſhillings. — The two firſt letters, that is, the 11th and 12th of <hi>Sentimens,</hi> were printed lately in a new tranſlation, (I think for <hi>Cooper</hi>) a ſhilling pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> was the author of theſe two books.

                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:0028500100:486"/>The caſe is the ſame as to differences, want of exactneſs, and ſmall miſtakes. We may juſtly celebrate the harmony or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0028500100:487"/>of the ſacred writers, with regard to the principal tranſactions by them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0028500100:488"/>as a ſtrong proof of the integrity of the evangeliſts, and of the certainty of the fact. This evinces the truth of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: but in matters of very ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt allow a want of accuracy, or ſlips of memory, or different informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This cannot hurt the authority of the goſpels, as it proves the honeſty of the writers by ſhewing they did not compoſe by compact: and I think, that ſome of the evangeliſts having been eye-witneſſes of, and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:0028500100:489"/>actors in the facts of the ſeveral goſpels; and others having written from the information of thoſe who had got a perfect information of all things from the very beginning, is an argument ſolid and rational for the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the evangelical hiſtory. It is ſufficient. I am ſure it is better to allow this, than to ſay the writers of the four goſpels were <hi>mere organs,</hi> when the little omiſſions and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacies obſervable in their records, cannot be accounted for, if we ſuppoſe that God conveyed the facts and truths through them, as <hi>pipes,</hi> to the world.

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:0028500100:490"/>as he was then in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed) that at the <hi>ſixth hour,</hi> that is, ſix o'clock in the morning, he brought <hi>Jeſus</hi> out to them again, the laſt time, and ſtrove to mitigate the rage of the Jews, and ſave the life of Chriſt: but as this was what he could not do, he waſhed his hands before them all, to let them know he was not the author of the innocent man's death, and after that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up to the ſoldiers, to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when they had ſcourged him.</p>
               <p>When all this was done, (ſays <hi>St. Mark,</hi> reckoning in the Jewiſh manner), it was the <hi>third hour,</hi> that is, nine o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they crucified him.

If St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, the <hi>Lord appeared to Mary Magdalene,</hi> and <hi>the other Mary,</hi> that might be, without a contradiction, tho' <hi>St. Mark</hi> ſays, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>firſt to Mary Magdalene.</hi> The caſe to me appears to be this. <hi>Mary Magdalene, Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>James,</hi> and the other women, went with ſpices and ointments to embalm the body, Sunday the 28th of April, early in the morning, about ſix and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:0028500100:491"/>thirty hours after it had been laid in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and when they arrived at the place, found not the body, but two angels, as young men in white apparel, who told them <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was riſen to life again, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf foretold, and therefore they muſt make haſte to his apoſtles, to acquaint them with the news, and let them know that they would ſee him in <hi>Galilee,</hi> according to his predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With theſe joyful tidings the women haſtened away to the eleven diſciples, and related to them what they had heard and ſeen. The apoſtles looked upon this account as a dream or viſion; but however, on <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi>'s aſſuring <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> apart, that ſhe had really been in the tomb, and found it empty; from whence it was moſt certain, that either <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen, or they had removed his body; theſe apoſtles ran both to the ſepulchre, and <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> went with them. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> then ſaw, that it was as ſhe had affirmed, and after they had viewed the tomb, the clothes, and the napkin, returned from the ſepulchre, greatly wondering what was become of their maſter's body: but <hi>Mary</hi> continued at the monument, lamenting very greatly, that ſhe could not ſee Jeſus either alive or dead, and while ſhe thus bemoaned herſelf, the <hi>Lord</hi> appeared to her. As <hi>St. Mark</hi> ſays, <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:0028500100:492"/>appeared firſt to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had caſt out ſeven devils:</hi> and after ſhe had reverenced her dear Lord and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he bid her go immediately to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and tell them ſhe had ſeen him: let them alſo know that I have aſſured thee, I ſhall quickly leave this world, and aſcend to the <hi>God and Father of us all, my Father and your Father, my God and your God,</hi> unto thoſe happy manſions where he manifeſts his preſence in a moſt eſpecial manner; there to receive full power over all things both in heaven and earth, and to prepare a place for you; that where I am, there ye may be alſo. <hi>Mary</hi> accordingly departed. She told the apoſtles that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had appeared to her, and acquainted them with the <hi>joyful</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>As to the other women, it is evident that they likewiſe went a ſecond time to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, to look for the body of their maſter, and having in vain ſearched for it, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the apoſtles, to let them know they had enquired to no purpoſe, when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> himſelf met them, ſaying All hail. Does not this <hi>reconcile Mark's account with Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's?</hi> I think ſo. To me it is ſo very plain from what all the ſacred relators have declared of the matter, that I am aſtoniſhed how <hi>Jerom</hi> could be ſo perplexed with the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0028500100:493"/>two accounts, as to ſay, that <hi>Mark's account,</hi> (the laſt twelve verſes of his goſpel) might be rejected here as <hi>ſpurious,</hi> becauſe it was found only in a few copies of that goſpel, and contradicted the other evangeliſts. <hi>Non recipimus Marci teſtimonium, quod in raris fertur evangeliis — praeſertim cum diverſa atque contraria evangeliſtis ceteris narrare videatur.</hi>

               <p>In the next place, if the account I have given was liable to any objection, and you could ſhew me that it was not the truth of the caſe; which, at preſent, I think impoſſible: If it was evident from the goſpels, that the women were not a ſecond time at the tomb, but that <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and the <hi>other women,</hi> the firſt time they were all there together, yet this may be, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, without <hi>Mark</hi>'s contradicting <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi> The meaning of the words of <hi>Mark — he appeared firſt to Mary Magdalene</hi> — might be, that as ſhe and the women were returning from the monument, to tell the news to the apoſtles, <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared to them, and in particular, addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Mary Magdalene;</hi> directing his diſcourſe to her, and ſpeaking familiarly and affectionately to her, to diſtinguiſh her as his conſtant follower in his life-time, and one on whom he had worked a great miracle of healing.
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0028500100:494"/>This, I imagine, might very juſtly be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed — <hi>he appeared firſt to Mary Magdalene</hi> — To appear firſt to any one of a company, as I take it, is to come up to, or ſtand before ſome particular perſon, in order to ſpeak to ſuch perſon. This, in my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, removes the difficulty, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles <hi>Mark</hi> to <hi>Matthew:</hi> but to this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I prefer the women's being at ſecond times at the ſepulchre; that is, <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> a ſecond time, when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went to the tomb, on what ſhe had earneſtly told them apart: and afterwards, the other <hi>Mary, Salome, Joanna,</hi> etc. a ſecond time. The goſpels, in my opinion, make this very plain

                     <p>Long ſince my converſation with Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risfort,</hi> I have ſeen an excellent book, written by the learned miniſter of Maybole, in which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, through ſeveral 4to pages, from p. 213, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> by virtue of a <hi>ſecond viſit</hi> to the monument by <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> when the <hi>Lord</hi> appeared firſt to her; — and a ſecond viſit to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre by the other women, when <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared next to thoſe women; and, in my opinion, he has proved it, beyond a poſſibility of rational reply. See Mr. <hi>Macknight's harmony. Le Clerc,</hi> in his <hi>harmony,</hi> does likewiſe evince the thing.</p>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>What has been ſaid, (Mr. <hi>Berrisfort</hi> told me), ſeems plauſible, nd ought to ſatisfy every honeſt man. It gives me content: but there is one thing ſtill that perplexes me,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:0028500100:495"/>and that is, the various lections of the New Teſtament. Do they not hurt the book?</p>
               <p>No: <hi>(Jack Buncle</hi> replied), notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cry of infidels, and that ſome learned men of the church of Rome have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhake the credit of the two teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to bring the people to the papal chair, to know the truth, on account of the various readings; yet, nevertheleſs, they are rather an advantage and ſecurity to the ſacred text than a detriment to the written word. They corroborate the authority of the ſacred book, and give it additional advantages.</p>
               <p>It is a truth that there are many various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Terence, Livy, Virgil, Caeſar, Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, Homer, Plutarch,</hi> etc. and yet who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the genuineneſs and great uſe of thoſe noble authors of ſenſe and politeneſs? who is ſo hardy as to queſtion whether the works univerſally aſcribed to them be their own and the product of thoſe immortal wits? On the contrary, men of thought and clear heads, converſant in thoſe ſtudies, will agree that thoſe authors of antiquity of which there are the moſt various readings, are rendered the moſt pure and correct. And why ſhould not the various readings of the bible rather lead men of ſound learning and judgment to the true meaning of the divine writers, than endanger their miſtaking their genuine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:0028500100:496"/>Where there are ſeveral readings, it is highly probable one of them is the original; and it is eaſier by their help to rectify the miſtakes of ſome copies, for when we have only one manuſcript, there may be ſcope for fancy; but none for judicious compariſon and well-grounded criticiſm.</p>
               <p>Style and language may be diſtinguiſhed by a happy genius of natural ſagacity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by true learning and proper applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as ſtatues, pictures, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. No age can counterfeit Cicero, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, St. Mark, St. John, St. Paul, no more than a counterfeit picture, medal, etc. can be impoſed on, and deceive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat maſters and judges of thoſe ingenious profeſſions and ſciences.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is nothing in the various lections that affects the eſſentials of religion, or can imply a conſiderable depravation of the copies, that alters or weakens one moral contained in the divine books. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it cannot with reaſon be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that God Almighty ſhould work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual miracles to prevent the miſtakes and blunders of every careleſs or corrupt hand, of thoſe numerous tranſcribers of thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred volumes, no more than by a reſiſtleſs power and reſtraint to prevent all the errors and villanis committed by free and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures; yet the argument receives ſtrength, that notwithſtanding the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:0028500100:497"/>variations, miſtakes and contradictions in ſmall matters, the all-ſeeing eye of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has ſo watched his own bleſſed and glorious revelations to mankind, that <hi>all the tranſcripts of that divine volume agree in the eſſential doctrine and grand deſign of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> This is a truth that Infidels and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts cannot diſprove.</p>
               <p>I obſerve in the laſt place, that excluſive of the care of Providence, there could not poſſibly happen any detriment to our ſacred records by various readings: for though in an innumerable number of copies of the goſpel that were made before printing was known, and in the many tranſlations of it into ſeveral languages, where the idioms are different, and the phraſe may be miſtaken, it was almoſt impoſſible there ſhould not be various lections, and ſlips of amanuenſes, yet the ſacred volumes in the early ages of chriſtianity, were diſpoſed into innumerable hands, tranſlated into ſo many languages, kept in ſo many libraries, churches, and in private families of believers, and ſo carefully preſerved and revered as the authentic deeds and charters of eternal happineſs, that they were not capable of being falſified.</p>
               <p>Nor could thoſe ineſtimable copies, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as they were over the then diſcovered world, and in the noble language ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known and acceptable, be liable to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, by ſudden revolutions and public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters;
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:0028500100:498"/>becauſe thoſe convulſions and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing calamities, could not happen alike in every country at one time.</p>
               <p>Neither could a general corruption of manners, a ſpirit of profuſeneſs or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor the wicked example, and ſtrong influence of tyrannical princes, of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate clergy, and atheiſtical miniſters of ſtate, prevail over many diſtant and independant nations, to endeavour to corrupt and deſtroy their ſacred book.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, we are to conſider that chriſtianity was the eccleſiaſtical law of all chriſtian nations under the ſun. The <hi>great law</hi> which aſſured to them their religious right and properties, their claims and titles to immortality, to the inheritance of the ſaints in light, an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved for them in the heavens. Which, to every one that deſerves the name of <hi>man</hi> and <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> muſt be infinitely more dear than titles to lands on this earth. For men are naturally more watchful in a matter ſo dear to them, and every believer would think himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, no more to let a change of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to paſs uncorrected, than the children of this world, who are wiſeſt in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, would overlook a flaw in deeds of ſale, or contract, which would aſſert their title, and evacuate the main intention of making ſuch indentures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:0028500100:499"/>The primitive chriſtians muſt be ſuppoſed to be exceeding watchful and jealous that no corruption or abuſes ſhould be put on that ſacred book, more dear and valuable to them than all <hi>other intereſts</hi> and <hi>treaſures.</hi> When theſe brave champions of the croſs were brought to the tribunals of the heathen perſecutors, and were commanded to deliver their bible to the flames, they moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly refuſed it, and gave their bodies to be burnt rather than the divine book.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, it is eaſier to ſuppoſe, a <hi>new bible</hi> or a <hi>new ſtatute book</hi> might be impoſed at this time of day upon this nation, without diſcovery, than to ſuppoſe a forged goſpel, a new teſtament corrupted ſo far as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for the good ends Providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by it, could be impoſed on the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal chriſtian world.</hi> It is eaſier to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that any forgery might creep into the municipal law of any particular nation, than that all the nations, whither chriſtianity is ſpread, ſhould conſpire in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel: which moſt ſacred inſtitution is to all chriſtians of infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater concern and value than their temporal laws, and all the ſecular immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges which they ſecure to them.</p>

               <p>And if from this unanſwerable way of reaſoning in defence of the genuine purity of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:0028500100:501"/>the ſacred ſcriptures, we look next upon the Providence of the Great God in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant caſe, is it not conſonant to ſound ſenſe, and the notions that rational creatures muſt have of the ſupreme and all-perfect Being, firmly to believe that the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and providence, which took care for the <hi>writing,</hi> would likewiſe take care for <hi>preſerving theſe ineſtimable books,</hi> ſo free at leaſt from corruption, that they might be ſufficient for the gracious ends for which they were written, and be able to make us wiſe to ſalvation? I think ſo. To me it is evident, that ſince infinite goodneſs was pleaſed to reveal a religion, that teaches men to know Jehovah to be the true God, and to know Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent; his providence muſt not only preſerve the book on which the doctrine depends, but ſo ſecure it from corruption, as to render it a plain rule to mankind. While there is a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the holy ſcriptures will remain the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and unalterable ſtandard of true religion.</p>
               <p>What you ſay (Mr. Berrisfort replied) ſeems to me to be true. I have nothing to object. But once more — let me aſk you, in reſpect of the <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> which followed the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is it not very ſtrange, that this is not mentioned by any of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles who are ſaid to have been eye-witneſſes of the fact, but <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> only are the relators of the thing, who were not apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:0028500100:502"/>and had all they writ from the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the apoſtles. If the apoſtles, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> did really ſee with their eyes the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> taken up from them into heaven, might we not expect, that they would write the hiſtory of that ſtill more wonderful tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction, as well as they had ſo exactly related the reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> for the men, who ſtood gazing up into heaven, after the Lord was carried up in a cloud (as <hi>Luke</hi> ſays they did) not to mention ſo very wonderful and intereſting an affair in their goſpels; — and men who did not ſee the thing, to relate it as part of the hiſtory they had received from the apoſtles; — this is what aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me. If it was a truth, ſurely ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a one ought not to be omitted by thoſe who ſaw it: ſince <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did write hiſtories of Chriſt, why ſhould they be ſilent on this grand article, and take no notice of it in their records? What do you ſay to this?</p>
               <p>I will tell you, (I replied): in the firſt place, <hi>noſtrum non eſt providentiae divinae ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones reddere. Placuit ſpiritui ſancto ita di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigere calamos Matthaei et Joannis, ut nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione reſurrectionis dominicae evangelia ſua concluderent.</hi> (Sic refert Philippus a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borch). — It does not become us to call Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to account, or aſſign the ways it ought to act in: infinite wiſdom thought fit to appoint, that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſhould
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0028500100:503"/>end their goſpels with the relation of our Lord's reſurrection: the reſurrection demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the divine miſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. To it, as a proof the moſt valid, and unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, our Lord referred the Jews, and therefore, to it, as the great fundamental, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> appealed: they proved it by declaring that they had converſed with Jeſus Chriſt after he aroſe from the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; and when that was proved, there could be no diſpute about any thing elſe. The divinity of the chriſtian religion, and the aſcenſion and glory of their Lord, reſt on this baſe. All the bleſſings likewiſe of the goſpel, regeneration, our reſurrection, and life eternal, are aſcribed by the apoſtles, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> to the reſurrection of Chriſt: and for theſe reaſons, to be ſure, when <hi>John</hi> had deſcribed his Lord's reſurrection, he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, — and <hi>many other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his diſciples, which are not written in this book — But theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing, ye might have life through his name.</hi> We muſt allow then, that the account of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> may be authentic, tho' not mentioned by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, St. <hi>John</hi> is not totally ſilent as to the aſcenſion of our <hi>Lord.</hi> In his ſixth chapter, ver. 62. it is written — <hi>What and if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0028500100:504"/>up where he was before?</hi> and in the 7th chapter, ver. 39th. <hi>But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe in him ſhould receive. For the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> Here moſt certainly the apoſtle ſpeaks of the aſcenſion of his Maſter, and tho' he did not write the hiſtory of it, yet, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, ſays the thing was to be; which confirms the accounts of St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Mark.</hi> And ſince, in the 14th and 15th chapters of St. <hi>John,</hi> ver. 16.26. the apoſtle declares, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> foretold he would <hi>ſend</hi> to them, his <hi>diſciples, the Comforter or holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> after his aſcenſion to heaven; and that the apoſtles <hi>demonſtrated</hi> by miracles, after the death of their Lord, that they <hi>had received this Comforter</hi> or <hi>divine Spirit,</hi> it follows, that the <hi>aſcenſion</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is as much <hi>aſſerted</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by the <hi>goſpel of St. John,</hi> as if that apoſtle, like <hi>Luke,</hi> had writ the hiſtory of it. This is evident to me. I think it is not poſſible to diſpute it.</p>
               <p>The ſum of the whole is, that the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the pious, and the arts of the crafty and intereſted, have defaced the true goſpel of Chriſt, and ſubſtituted human notions and conſequences in the place of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but let us ſtrip the ſacred records of the falſe gloſſes and ſyſtems, with which the theoriſts have covered it, and allow the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0028500100:505"/>enemy, that the apoſtles, ſometimes want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unerring ſpirit of their Maſter, were liable to ſlight miſtakes, and inadvertencies, in the repreſentation of ordinary events; that they did, ſometimes, by too great an affection for their Maſter's doctrine, ſtrain ſome things, and cite prophecies that did not relate to Jeſus in any ſenſe at all 

<note n="(44)" place="bottom">
                     <p>Let us now ſee (ſays a great man and upright chriſtian) what uſe the enemies of chriſtianity have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make of the prophecies, as the evangeliſts apply them; and what anſwer the truth of the caſe will oblige us to give to them.</p>
                     <p>They aſſert that the foundation of the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is laid by the evangeliſts, on the proof of this point, <hi>that the miſſion and character of Jeſus were foretold by the prophets;</hi> and that the validity of this proof depends intirely on the force of thoſe particular prophecies which the ſame evangeliſts have applied to the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in their ſeveral goſpels. Upon this hypotheſis, the enemy undertakes to ſhew, that the prophecies, ſo applied by them, do not at all relate to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in their proper and literal ſignification, but only in ſecondary, typical, and figurative ſenſe: but then this way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting them is equivocal, precarious, and incapable of yielding any rational ſatisfaction; and of conſequence chriſtianity has no foundation. Such is the uſe the enemy make of the prophecies applied by the evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.</p>
                     <p>In truth, if we admit that chriſtianity has no other foundation than what the enemy aſſign it, it might not perhaps be difficult for them to make good the reſt: for upon that ſuppoſition, many objections are thrown in our way, which it is ſcarce poſſible to get rid of. But while they fancy themſelves to be demoliſhing founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are battering only ſuch parts of the edifice,

as ſerve for its ornaments rather than its ſupport: and had the enemy gone farther, and ſhewn that ſome of the <hi>prophecies cited by Matthew</hi> did not relate to Jeſus in any ſenſe at all, they would have done no more than what ſome of the primitive fathers, as well as modern critics had done before them, without deſigning or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt hurt to chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeſus</hi> declared in general, that <hi>Moſes and the prophets had teſtified of him:</hi> but ſince the evangeliſts did not think it neceſſaay to give a preciſe account, or deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral prophecies, which were alleged by him in proof of that declaration; it is ſufficient to take it, juſt as we find it; without thinking ourſelves obliged to defend all the particular inſtances or applications, which were offered afterwards in ſupport of it by fallible men. Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> in his <hi>literal accompliſhment of the ſcripture prophecies,</hi> has produced 45 <hi>prophecies</hi> from the Old Teſtament, which are cited in the New, in proof <hi>of the Meſſiahſhip of Jeſus,</hi> and which he declares to have been <hi>clearly and directly fulfilled, without the leaſt pretence of any reply from any author whatſoever.</hi> Now if any number of theſe, how ſmall ſoever, are found to be as clearly accompliſhed, as he takes them to be, they are ſufficient to ſupport the authority of the goſpel, tho' all the reſt were thrown aſide.</p>
                     <p>But to ſay the truth, the grounds of our faith, in theſe <hi>latter ages of the church,</hi> do not lie in the particular interpretations of prophecies, made by men, who might be miſtaken, and who, as <hi>Jerome</hi>

                           <p>St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was born at <hi>Stridon,</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> in the year 340. — and died in the year 420. aged 80.— There is a good edition of his works in 9 volumes ſolio. Paris 1623. But the later edition of <hi>Martianay,</hi> the Benedictin, is much finer and more valuable.</p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Jerome</hi> was a hot, abuſive man, and quarrelled even with St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> In his diſputes, he is more like a madman than a faint, and ever in the wrong. He writ <hi>comments</hi> on all the <hi>prophets, Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and the <hi>epiſtles</hi> to the <hi>Galatians, Epheſians, Titus,</hi> and <hi>Philemon;</hi> but they are ſad ſtuff in reſpect of ſome modern performances. Compare them with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Dr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> Dr. <hi>Benſon,</hi> and others of our country, and you will ſee what a poor creature this ſaint was in reſpect of our Engliſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and philoſophers. He tranſlated the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament into <hi>Latin</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the <hi>Hebrew</hi> well: and he corrected the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Latin verſion of the New Teſtament. This is far from being correct, tho' the church of Rome has

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0028500100:508"/>


de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it to be infallible, and appointed it to be uſed in the church.—The beſt and moſt uſeful thing this ſaint writ is his <hi>treatiſe of illuſtrious men;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a ſummary of the lives and the titles of the books, written by eccleſiaſtical authors, to his time. The next in worth to this, in my opinion, is his book of letters; in which are ſeveral fine moral ſentiments, and much good advice; tho' his criticiſms on the bible in this work are weak enough. — He will have it, that it was <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and not a young woman, that <hi>David</hi> took into bed to him, when he was old and cold; which is a mere fancy, that plainly contradicts the hiſtory of that affair in the bible. But <hi>Jerome</hi> abhorred a woman, as much as Mrs. <hi>Aſtel</hi> did a man: and deteſted and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened <hi>matrimony</hi> and a <hi>wife,</hi> to extol and exalt that whim of his brain, virginity. With deteſtation (he owns), he beheld every big bellied woman, (the fineſt ſight in the world) tho' rendered ſo in the holy matrimonial bed, and could not bear looking at her, but as he reflected, that ſhe carried a virgin, So he tells us in his letters; and of conſequence, a fit ſupporter of St. Peter's chair.</p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is the next ſupporter and ſaint. He was born at Treves in the year 340.— and died the 4th of April 397.—Aged 57. This holy prelate was a great contender for <hi>tritheiſm</hi> and the <hi>rights of the church,</hi> and writ many worthleſs pieces for them and perſecution.

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0028500100:509"/>

He acted an inſolent and ſenſeleſs part, in the caſe of the emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> in the affair of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> when that prince ordered the ſeditious to be deſtroyed: and he died ſoon after the greateſt and moſt bleſſed of men: (ſay <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> who both writ his life.)—The beſt edition of his works is that of the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> Paris 1691, 2 volumes, folio: with many notes.</p>
                           <p>As to St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> and the four other ſaints of the name, to wit, the two <hi>Nazianzens, Nyſſe,</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to mention them in the next volume of my journal, and therefore, ſhall here only obſerve, in reſpect of <hi>Ncocaeſarea,</hi> uſually called <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> or the <hi>wonder-worker,</hi> that he died in the year 265, according to <hi>Baronius,</hi> and the <hi>ſaint</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> or in 270, according to <hi>Fabricius:</hi> and that the beſt edition of his works is that of <hi>Gerard Voſſius</hi> in 4to, Mayence, 1604. His pieces were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe printed at Paris in folio, 1621. with the writings of ſome minor ſaints. This folio is a collection of things written by ſaints.</p>

               <p> The 3d day of July, I left <hi>Yeoverin-Green,</hi> and ſet out again for <hi>Ulubrae,</hi> to get my horſes and portmanteau, but proceeded now on foot; becauſe, by climbing over a high mountain, which it was impoſſible for a horſe to aſcend, and then walking half a mile over a ſhaking-bog, where a beaſt could not go, I was to ſave many miles; and beſide, Mr. <hi>Berrisfort</hi> was ſo obliging as to ſend one of his ſervants back with Mr. Harcourt's horſes, which I knew not which way to return. With my pole in my hand then I ſet out, and after I had bid adieu to my friends, who walked with me a couple of miles to the foot of the hills, I bagan to mount the Alp at Six in the morning, and at eight arrived on its ſummit. Here I had a fine road, due ſouth, for an hour, till I came to a very ſteep deſcent, that led to the ſhaking-bog, as my paper of directions informed me. It was an ugly way down, and the better to go it, I reſolved firſt to breakfaſt, and bid <hi>Tim</hi> ſee what he had got in his wallet. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he produced a roaſt fowl, a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, and a bottle of cyder, and among ſome trees, on the brow of a hill, by the
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:0028500100:512"/>ſide of a ſpring, that ran off the Way I was to go, I ſat down to the repaſt. I gave my Lad half the Bird, and the other half I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a very ſhort Time, drank a Pint of Cyder, and was on my Feet again. I then began to deſcend, and in an Hour made a Shift to get to the bottom, tho' the way was bad; being very ſteep, wet, and ſlippery. I came to a dirty lane, about two hundred yards long, and that ended at the ſhaking-bog.</p>

They are very dangerous, frightful places, and many of them play up and down, like a long plank, in a very ſurprizing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

               <p> To go half a Mile over ſuch a bog, and the moſt elaſtic of them I had ever tried, was what I did not much like; tho' the author of my paper of directions, an old ſervant of Mr. <hi>Berrisfort,</hi> affirmed it was quite ſafe; and as to <hi>Tim,</hi> he would not,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:0028500100:513"/>on any conſideration, croſs it. He was poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive we ſhould ſink beyond Recovery. What to do then, was the queſtion? I tried for ſome Time to go round the bog, at the bottom of the encloſing mountains, but that was ſoon found impoſſible, and therefore, it only remained, to go up again to the top of the hill, and try onwards for ſome other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent beyond the bog. We did ſo, and after walking two hours ſouth-weſt, at a good rate, had a view of a deep glin, to which we deſcended by an eaſy ſlope, and marched thro' it, to the weſt, and north-weſt for two hours, till it ended at a wood. This we paſſed without any difficulty, as there were walks cut through it, and came out into a broad valley, that had a river very near us, and a ſweet pretty cottage on the margin of the flood. I went up to the houſe to aſk my way, and found at the door three men, the eldeſt of whom ſeemed to be about thirty years old. They aſked me very civilly to walk in, and ſeemed to wonder not a little at ſeeing me and my man, in ſuch a place, with our poles in our hands.</p>

               <head>97. An account of Mr. Fleming, and his two brothers.</head>
               <p> Theſe Men were three brothers, and Roman catholics. Two of them were gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-farmers, who lived together, and jointly managed the country buſineſs. The eldeſt was a Franciſcan frier, who came to viſit them. Their good manners, in their plain dreſs, ſurprized me; and their benevolence, made me wonder a great deal more. Their maid
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:0028500100:514"/>laid a clean cloth in a minute, and brought ſome cold roaſt beef, good bread, and fine ale. They bid me heartily welcome many times, and were ſo frank and generous, ſo chearful and gay; eſpecially the eldeſt of the farmers, who ſang ſeveral good ſongs over a bowl of punch after dinner, that I could not think of leaving them immediately, if I had known my road, and was eaſily prevailed on to ſtay ſeveral days. A friendſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced immediately between the eldeſt <hi>Fleming</hi> and me, and there was not one cold or croſs minute in it for the few years that he lived. He loved me as his brother from the firſt day he ſaw me, and I had ſo great a regard for him, that with a ſorrow I cannot help, I think of his death to this day. How to account for ſuch ſudden paſſions I know not. The thing has always appeared to me very ſtrange. Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi> to be ſure was a man of a bright and very extraordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though no more than a farmer in this world, had a moſt happy temper, a generoſity too great for his fortune, and was for ever chearful and free; but theſe things, however pleaſing, could not be the cauſe of the ſudden and laſting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between us, as I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with men of fortune who equalled him in theſe reſpects, and yet they never ſtruck me more than for the preſent Time. Whatever might be the cauſe, the fact is
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:0028500100:515"/>certain. No two men ever liked one another more than we did from the firſt hour of our acquaintance, and as I had the happineſs of converting him to the proteſtant religion, it is poſſible, that might cement a friendſhip, which, a ſameneſs of diſpoſition had helped to produce

                     <p>The arguments I uſed to make a <hi>convert</hi> of Mr. <hi>Fleming,</hi> the reader will find in the <hi>appendix</hi> to this journal, among other intereſting matters, that are too long to be inſerted in the ſtory of my life. I ſhall print them in hopes they may be of ſervice to ſome other ſoul. They were introduced the firſt day I was at Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi>'s houſe, by his ſaying to me, after dinner, — Dear ſir, will you give me leave to aſk you, by what ſtrange cauſe it has happened, that you are thus travelling on foot in this unviſited country. It muſt be an extraordinary affair I am ſure. — Sir, I replied, my caſe is very uncommon. I do not believe that any thing like it ever was before, and, perhaps, ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affair may never happen again. I little thought then, that I ſhould afterwards meet with two inſtances of the ſame kind of thinking and reſolution in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male world, to wit, Miſs <hi>Chawcer</hi> and Miſs <hi>Janſon;</hi> whoſe hiſtories I have given in the firſt volume of my Memoirs of ſeveral ladies of Great-Britain, p. 41—64. The critics, I remember, had ſome doubts as to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of theſe two caſes: but to this I anſwer, that they may as well doubt the truth of my own ſtory; and from thence proceed to deny the reality of my exiſtence; becauſe ſeveral incidents in my life are ſtrange, and ſuch as they have not heard of before. It is not, however, in the power of criticiſm to invalidate what I deliver as facts. I will tell you my ſtory: and ſo began to relate the religious Diſpute between my father and me, and how it was brought to a Head by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

poſſeſſed by a woman, called, a mother-in-law. As the glaſs went round, I let them know, how a man in the twenty-ſecond year of his age, forſook all for the <hi>true goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and at a time of life, when very few think of religion, reſolved to confeſs himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian deiſt,</hi> to all whom it concerned, if it brought him to want, and from a morſel of bread to the grave. So far I was heard without interruption, tho' I declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the way againſt the dreadful hereſy of three gods: but not thinking I was in company with <hi>catholics,</hi> (for then I imagined that ſuch ſubjects of the king of England were only to be found in Ireland), I brought into my oration againſt falſe religion, the <hi>diaboliſm</hi> of <hi>popery,</hi> and gave it ſeveral thruſts; as, indeed, I always do, whenever, it comes in my way: for, good reader, tho' I love the <hi>catholic</hi> men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, becauſe I am a friend to man, and nearly related to many Romaniſts of great fortune; yet, <hi>popery</hi> I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor; and look upon it as the greateſt woe that ever the devil introduced into this lower world, to ruin man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: but when I began to touch this ſtring, and was raking <hi>Rome papal</hi> fore and aft, <hi>Fleming,</hi> the <hi>Frier,</hi> changed colour ſeveral times, (which I took notice of, and knew not what to aſcribe it to, unleſs he was very ſick) and at laſt he told me, by way of game, that I was an eloquent young gentleman, and had a flow of language; but my miſtakes as to the church of Rome were very great, and he begged leave, as he was a <hi>prieſt</hi> of the holy Roman church, to ſet me right in my notions. This was a great ſurprize to me. It ſtruck me ſilent for ſome minutes. At laſt, however, I told the gentlemen, that I aſked their pardons for making ſo free with their religion, which I ſhould not preſume to have done, but that I thought they had been proteſtants: that, as to his offer to ſet me right, he did me great honour, and I


<pb n="502" facs="tcp:0028500100:517"/>


would with pleaſure hear him. I would, to be ſure, be a convert to the ſtrength of his arguments if unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; or, offer ſuch reaſons for remaining a proteſtant, as muſt ſatisfy a rational man. He then went on, and my reply followed. The ſubſtance of this is what the reader is to find in the Appendix.</p>

. This is all I can ſay as to

               <p> But as to the ſhaking bog I was to have paſſed to go to the gentlemen at <hi>Ulubrae, Fleming</hi> told me, I had a fortunate eſcape in not venturing over it; for, tho' it be paſſable in one narrow way, about a yard broad, yet a ſtranger to the bog muſt periſh in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to croſs; as the timber cauſeway that was made over the great marſh, time out of mind, is inviſible in many places, and one ſinks for ever, the moment he ſteps off that way: but I will ſhew you an eaſy road (my new friend continued) to the gentlemen's houſe, to whom I am no ſtranger, and will make you acquainted with ſome paſſes thro' the mountains, that will render it eaſier riding over this country than you have found it. He did ſo, and by his guidance I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Ulubrae,</hi> the 7th day of July; being the 17th day from the morning I left the philoſophers.

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:0028500100:518"/>mourned my ſad fate: they were impatient to hear the adventure of the mountain, and by what ſtrange means, I was jumbled all the way to <hi>Tom Fleming</hi>'s; who lives ſo far from the hill I went into; and the road from it to his houſe, ſcarce paſſable for a mortal.

I had told him the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs I was going on, and he requeſted, if I ſucceeded, that I would bring Miſs <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth</hi> to his houſe, that his brother might marry us; and as to <hi>Orton-Lodge,</hi> which I had deſcribed to him, and told him where to find, (for he had no notion of it, nor had ever been among the fells of Weſtmoreland; as he thought that country unpaſſable), he promiſed me, he would go there himſelf, and bring with him two labouring men to aſſiſt my lad, in putting the garden and houſe in the beſt condition they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving; that he would bring there ſeeds, and trees, ſuch as the ſeaſon allowed, and do every thing in his power, to render the place convenient and pleaſing: he would likewiſe ſell me a couple of his cows, a few ſheep, and other things, which I ſhould find before me at the lodge, and let me have one of his maids for my ſervant in
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:0028500100:520"/>the houſe. This was good indeed. I could not wiſh for more</p>

               <head>100. 1725, From Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſton I went to Mrs. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil's to look for Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth; but ſhe was gone.</head>
               <p> The 9th of July, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Fleming</hi> and I parted, and I proceeded as faſt as well I could to the appointed ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but when I came up to Mrs. <hi>Aſgill</hi>'s door, the 2d day in the evening, July 10, and aſked for Miſs <hi>Melmoth,</hi> an old man, the only perſon in the houſe, told me, Mrs. <hi>Aſgill</hi> had been dead near a month, and Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> went from thence immediately after the funeral of her friend; that ſhe had left a letter with him for a gentleman that was to call upon her; but that letter by an accident was deſtroyed, and where the lady then was, he could not ſo much as gueſs: he farther told me, that Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> had ſold the goods of the houſe, and the ſtock, bequeathed to her by her deceaſed friend, to the gentleman who inherited the late Mrs. <hi>Aſgill</hi>'s jointure, and ſhe would return no more to the place. This was news to me. It ſtruck me to the ſoul. Doleful tidings, how ye wound. What to do I could not tell, but as I rid to the next town, determined at laſt, to try if I could hear of her at York. To that city I went the next day, aſked at the inns, walked the walls, and went to the aſſembly-room. My enquiries were all in vain. One gentleman only did I ſee who was acquainted with her, and he knew nothing of her preſent abode. From York then I proceeded the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:0028500100:521"/>to ſearch other towns, and left no place unexamined where I could think ſhe might be. Three weeks were ſpent in this manner, without hearing a ſyllable of her, and then I thought it was beſt to return to my lodge; for what ſignified my five hundred pounds to appear with in the world. It muſt be ſoon gone as I had not the leaſt notion of any kind of trade; and if I joined any one that was in buſineſs, I might be miſtaken in the man, and ſo cheated and undone. Then what could I do but carry a brown muſket, or go a hand before the maſt; for, as to being an uſher to a ſchool for bread, were I reduced to want, that was the life of all lives that I moſt abhorred. Nothing elſe then had I for it but my ſilent mountain-lodge, which kind providence had brought me to. There I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go, and in that charming ſolitude, peruſe alone the book of nature, till I could hear of ſome better way of ſpending my time.</p>

               <head>101. By acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I meet Miſs Melmoth.</head>
               <p> To this purpoſe then I went the 2d of Auguſt, 1725, to <hi>Barnard's Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Durham,</hi> and intended the next morning to ſet out for Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Stanemore,</hi> to go from thence to my cottage on the ſide of a <hi>Weſtmorland-Fell:</hi> but after I had rid a mile of the road to <hi>Eggleſton,</hi> where I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to dine, I called out to my lad to ſtop. A ſudden thought came into my head, to ride firſt to <hi>Gretabridge,</hi> as I was ſo near it,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:0028500100:522"/>to ſee ſome fine Roman monuments, that are in the neighbourhood of that village. To that place I went then, and paſſed the day in looking over all the antiquities and curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I could find there. I returned in the evening to my inn, and while a fowl was roaſting for my ſupper, ſtood leaning againſt the houſe-door, looking at ſeveral travellers that went by, and ſome that came to reſt where I did that night. Many figures I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, but none I knew. At laſt there came riding up to the inn, full ſpeed, a young lady on a moſt beautiful beaſt, and after her, two horſes more; on one of which was her man ſervant, and on the other her maid. She had a black maſk on her face, to ſave her from the duſt and ſun, and when ſhe lit from her horſe, ſhe id not take it off, but went with it on into the houſe, after ſhe had looked for a moment or two at me. This I thought very ſtrange. A charmer to be ſure, I ſaid. With what life and grace did ſhe come to the ground! but how cruel the dear little rogue is, to conceal the wonders of its face. Landlord, I ſaid to the maſter of the houſe, who was coming up to me, can you contrive a way to get me one view of that maſked lady, and I will give you a pint. — Sir, mine hoſt replied, that I can do very eaſily, for this lady has ſent me to let you know, ſhe wants to ſpeak with you —
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:0028500100:523"/>with me! — Tranſporting news! I flew to her apartment, and there ſaw that dear irreſiſtable creature, who had added to the <hi>inferior</hi> charms of face and perſon, that <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of <hi>conauct</hi> and <hi>converſation,</hi> which are the <hi>true glory</hi> of a <hi>woman.</hi> It was Miſs <hi>Melmoth.</hi> She had heard I had been at Mrs. <hi>Aſgill</hi>'s houſe, and did not get the letter ſhe left for me; which made her think of riding towards <hi>Gretabridge,</hi> on an imagination ſhe might find me thereabout; as ſhe remembered to have heard me ſay, in one of our converſations, that I intended as ſoon as I could, to look at the Roman anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities in this place: but ſhe had very little hopes (ſhe added) of ſucceeding in her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; as little as I had of her riding up to the inn; and this made the meeting the more pleaſing. It did enhanſe the pleaſure indeed. It turned the amour into an adventure, and gave it that delicious flavor, which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns read of in the hiſtories of paſt times, but rarely experience in theſe days. The reader that has been engaged in ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and tender ſcene, can only form an idea of a felicity, which words would in vain attempt to expreſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we had ſupped, I recited my adventures ſince we parted, and gave Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> a flowery deſcription of <hi>Orton-Lodge;</hi> then aſked, if ſhe would bleſs me with her
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:0028500100:524"/>hand, and ſit down with me in my pretty ſolitude.</p>
               <p>Sir, (Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> replied), if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, I would go with you to <hi>Hudſon's-Bay,</hi> had I a hundred thouſand, inſtead of four thouſand pounds; which is my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, excluſive of ſome perſonal eſtate, which my friend Mrs. <hi>Aſgill</hi> by her will bequeathed me; and the whole is at your ſervice, to diſpoſe of as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Give me thy hand then (I ſaid,) thou ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous girl. You make me the happieſt of men, and in return I ſwear by that <hi>one, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, tremendous Power</hi> I adore, that I will be true and faithful to thee, till death diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the ſacred obligation. Twice do I ſwear by the <hi>great Spirit,</hi> in whoſe dread preſence I am, with your right hand now locked faſt in mine, acroſs this table, and call on him as witneſs to our vows, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, nor chance, nor aught but death's inevitable hand, ſhall e'er divide our loves. Miſs <hi>Melmoth</hi> ſaid, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>Early the next morning,  the third of Auguſt, we rid to <hi>Eggleſton,</hi> where we breakfaſted, and proceeded from thence to Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi>'s houſe, up Stanemore hills, where we arrived at nine o'clock in the evening, and had beds there that night. My friend <hi>Tom</hi> and his brother <hi>Jemmy,</hi> were gone to a fair; but the eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:0028500100:525"/>the <hi>Franciſcan fryer,</hi> was at home, and entertained us very well. We took him with us very early the next day to <hi>Orton-Lodge,</hi> which we reached at eight in the evening, and found the houſe and garden in good order. My friend, Mr. <hi>Fleming,</hi> had done every thing poſſible, to make it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and comfortable place. He had made near the Lodge two little rooms for ſervants, and had put a bed in the green-houſe in the garden for a friend. He had likewiſe ſent there a couple of cows, ſome ſheep and lambs, ducks and geeſe, cocks and hens, and every neceſſary he thought we might want there. <hi>Good Tom Fleming.</hi> There never was a better man, or a kinder friend, to his ſmall power.</p>
               <p>We had likewiſe fiſh in abundance, in the waters at the foot of our hills, and goats and kids, and plenty of wild fowl. Few things were wanting that reaſon could deſire; and for us, who thought that happineſs, that is, pleaſure and repoſe, did not precariouſly depend on what others think, or ſay, or do; but ſolidly conſiſted in what we ourſelves did feel, and reliſh, and enjoy, there could not be a more delightful ſtation diſcovered on this globe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the beſt things that <hi>Orton-Lodge</hi> afforded, were ordered to the fire, and before they were brought on the table, the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:0028500100:526"/>man of God threw the fillet or ribband over our hands, according to the Romiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and pronounced the nuptial benediction on us. Huſband and wife we ſat down to ſupper.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus did the ſtars preſide with friendly rays,</l>
                  <l>And bid me hail at laſt the happy days,</l>
