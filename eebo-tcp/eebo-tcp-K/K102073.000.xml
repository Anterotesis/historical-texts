            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE writing of practical Obſervations is ſo ancient, and ſo univerſally approv'd among Phyſicians, that I need make no Apology for following that Method in thoſe I now offer to the Publick. I ſhall only take Notice, that they come forth in the ſame Order as they ſtood in my own private Journal; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they be mix'd with Incidents which are ſomewhat unuſual in ſuch Performances, yet, I hope they will not prove the leſs beneficial, as they are, in every Reſpect, calculated for the Relief of thoſe Perſons who date their <hi>Splenetick</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouriſh</hi> Diſorders from the melancholy Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Times, whereunto every good Phyſician ought to have a ſtrict Regard, as the Impreſſions made by ſuch Cauſes may ſometimes require other Aids beſides thoſe of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>But there are other Reaſons which may juſtify my deviating ſomewhat out of the common Road in this Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> The many concurring Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which render'd thoſe Maladies more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily obſtinate. The Diſaſters which happen'd to Mens Pockets fell out, unluckily, about that Seaſon of the Year, when above Two Thirds of the Nation
<pb facs="tcp:0544800100:3"/>are naturally <hi>Splenetick,</hi> and when the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented of all Denominations uſually ſet their Plots and Machinations on foot. It is no wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the ordinary Methods can avail nothing, but that we are forced to have Recourſe to all the Stratagems and Arguments our Wit and Reaſon can afford us.</p>
            <p>This is all the Apology I thought neceſſary to make for what the Reader may find new or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, and I ſhall take my Leave, by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that I intend my Obſervations, for the two following Months, ſhall alſo be publiſh'd in a ſhort Time, and will contain all the remaining Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that were moſt remarkable in that Branch of my Practice, during the black and gloomy Seaſon of the Year; and I doubt not, when my Labours are once finiſh'd, they will have the ſame Effect with the moſt efficacious Remedies, either to kill or cure.</p>

            <head>From the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> 1720. OBSERVATIONS ON THE <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HENRY FREEMAN,</hi> Eſq; aged 42, and of a plethorick Habit of Body, was ſeiz'd with a Giddineſs, and a Riſing in his Throat, accompany'd with Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and many other Symptoms that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Hypochondriack Diſorders. He told me, when I ask'd him how long he had been ill, that he had found the Diſtemper creeping on him for above a Month, but that he was every Day grown worſe than another; that the Giddineſs was but newly come upon him, and that he believ'd it was caus'd by a Cold he had got in <hi>Exchange-Ally</hi> the Day before, where he had waited an Opportunity to ſell ſome Stock. He told me likewiſe, that he had got a Pain, or rather an Uneaſineſs in his Left Side near the ſhort Ribs; and that he believ'd it was occaſion'd by a Jew who came to beat down the Price of Stocks, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large Bag of Money, which, by reaſon of the Crowd, happen'd to be preſs'd ſeveral times againſt his Side; that he had ever ſince then been troubled with a Faintneſs; and in fine, that he was ſo bad, that he believ'd he could hardly live to another Day, unleſs I could find ſome ſpeedy Relief for him. I ſoon perceiv'd by thoſe Circumſtances, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0544800100:5"/>had been an Adventurer in the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> and that all his Ailments had taken their Date from the Time the Stocks began to fall; yet, as I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dive particularly into his Affairs, I only told him, that I perceiv'd he had met with ſomething late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that had lain heavy upon him, which had been the Cauſe of all theſe Diſorders. That the Giddineſs, when accompany'd with a Riſing in the Throat, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways denoted Trouble of Mind, either from ſome external Cauſe, which is able to make too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Impreſſions on our Imaginations, or from our own diſtemper'd Imaginations alone. That the Pain and Heavineſs in his Side might alſo, with more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, proceed from the ſame univerſal Cauſe, than from any external Injury, as it was for the moſt part a concurring Symptom. I likewiſe took notice, that the Spirits were always ſeiz'd and much affected in thoſe Diſorders; becauſe the Impreſſions were firſt made upon them. The Gentleman was fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that I had fallen rightly upon his Diſtemper, and began to tell me of his own accord, that he had been a conſiderable Loſer of late, as he was one of the laſt Subſcribers. He ſaid, he always had a Diffidence in that great Project, and was even led into it in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Multitude, tho' it was againſt the plain Dictates of his own Mind. After which, he ask'd me if I thought his Diſeaſe would prove mortal; for he had never been in ſuch a Condition before. I made Anſwer, that the Diſtemper ſeldom prov'd mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to any but thoſe who gave themſelves wholly up to it, and would by no means arm themſelves againſt it; I therefore advis'd him to be chearful, and not to think too much of his Loſſes, and I would order what was proper, by way of Phyſick; and when I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd him a Vomit and ſome Pills, with a Bottle of Cephalic Drops, I left him.</p>
            <p>Next Day I found him eas'd of the worſt Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, but the Heavineſs and Pain of his Side was not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0544800100:6"/>altogether abated, and the riſing of his Throat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; he ſeem'd alſo to be very melancholy; whereupon I ordered him a Liniment for his Side, and bid him continue in the Uſe of thoſe Things I had already preſcrib'd; but above all, to arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the Diſturbance of his Mind, which I perceiv'd at that Time to be great; but as he was naturally a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of Senſe and Reſolution, he ſoon got the better of his Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Lady <hi>Arabella Blackham,</hi> aged 37, of a ſanguin Complexion, but of a ſomewhat delicate Make, was ſuddenly ſeized with violent Fits; but before I could get to her Lodgings, they had left her, and ſhe was faln aſleep. I ask'd her Woman after what Manner ſhe was taken, who made Anſwer, that her Lady had been in a very ſtrange Condition, and had been very ill for a Month or longer, with hot Fluſhings in her Face, and had got ſeveral Cordials from the Apothecary, and was ſometimes better and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worſe; but that ſomething the Apothecary had ſaid to her the Day before had lain ſo on her Mind, and had brought her into ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch Madneſs, that they were not able to hold her; but ſhe tore every one that came near her, ſometimes laughing, and ſometimes cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was but juſt quieted. She ſaid her Lady had never been well ſince the Fall of the Stocks, having put all Miſs's Fortune into the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> with an Intention to marry her to Sir <hi>John Frisk</hi>'s eldeſt Son, who would have 20000 Pounds a Year at the Death of his Father, that ſhe had borrowed Money on all her own Plate and Jewels, excepting one Salver and a Pair of Candleſticks; and that ſhe believ'd her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſign'd herſelf to marry a Gentleman that us'd to viſit her, but that the Match was broke off within this Fortnight.</p>
            <p>After ſo full an Account, I could not be at a loſs how to judge of my Lady's Indiſpoſition. I told the young Woman I would wait upon her Lady in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0544800100:7"/>Morning, becauſe I was of Opinion ſhe would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably reſt all Night, after ſhe had been ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd.</p>
            <p>Next Day I call'd as ſoon as it was proper; but the Lady was ſomewhat frighten'd when ſhe firſt ſaw me, and ask'd me if the Plague was come to <hi>London;</hi> begging, if I had been with any one that had it, not to come near her. I aſſur'd her, <hi>London</hi> was very free from the Plague, and that ſhe needed not be under any Apprehenſions. The reaſon of the Lady's Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, as I came to know ſince, was from what the Apothecary had ſaid to her. He is accounted a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt Man; but it ſeems, from a Deſire the Lady ſhould think him learned enough in his Profeſſion, he told her ſhe had ſome bad Signs, and would be apt to have the <hi>Furor Uterinus;</hi> this being a Diſeaſe ſhe had never heard of, made her imagine it might be the new Diſtemper that now infeſts our neighbouring Kingdom.</p>
            <p>After I had deliver'd the Lady out of all her Fears, I went and examin'd her Pulſe, and found it very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid. She told me ſhe was very full of Pain, and ſeem'd as if ſhe had been beat with Cudgels. That, I ſaid, was nothing but what was uſual after all ſuch violent Diſorders, and that ſhe would recover her Sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a few Days. I order'd her ſome Pills with <hi>Aſa foetida,</hi> and a <hi>Galbanum</hi> Plaiſter, as alſo an Hyſterical Julep to drink after her Pills, or at any other Time when the Fits threaten'd. I order'd her likewiſe a volatile and cephalick Mixture, whereby the Lady is now altogether recover'd, excepting only that the Fluſhings ſometimes return upon her.</p>
            <p>Another Diſorder of the ſame Kind happen'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at this Time to one <hi>Mary Duroy,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Thomas Duroy</hi> Mercer in the <hi>Strand.</hi> I found her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in the Vapours, and ſcarcely ſenſible; ſhe told me little of her Indiſpoſition, but ſaid ſhe was the unhappieſt Woman in the World. That ſhe had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0544800100:8"/>a Husband, who kept all his Affairs to himſelf, and never would acquaint her with any Thing he did, but went on his own Way to ruin himſelf and his whole Family. But as I had no Buſineſs with the Concerns between Man and Wife, I turn'd to an elderly Woman who attended her as her Nurſe, to learn what Condition her Miſtreſs had been in. But the Nurſe had, it ſeems, entred into Confederacy with her Miſtreſs againſt Mr. <hi>Duroy;</hi> and to pleaſe her, had been exaſperating his Faults, and, at the ſame Time, heightning her Miſtreſs's Diſorders. For inſtead of anſwering my Queſtion, ſhe took up the Story where the other had ended. We Women, ſays ſhe, are now-a-days no more looked upon by the Men, than if we were Hobby-Horſes. Look ye, Sir, my Maſter went a ſtock-jobbing, and us'd to get his hundred Pounds a Day; my Miſtreſs, like a good Wife, kept in the Shop all the while, from Morn to Night, and charg'd him every Day to bring her home a Gold Watch, which was but a ſmall Thing to his gettings. He told her one Week after another he would be worth 500 <hi>l.</hi> a Year the next, and then ſhe ſhould have one of threeſcore Pounds; and till then, it was not becoming her to wear one; but God knows how he has jobb'd it at laſt, I am ſure he has left my Miſtreſs in a ſtrange Condition, and never comes near her but on Sundays, and then he ſits moping all Day without ſpeaking to any Body; and if my Miſtreſs asks him a Queſtion, he tells her ſhe's a Fool, and Women will always be meddling with what does not concern them. Here I put a Stop to the Nurſe, who I found was but beginning her Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in order to know ſomething of her Miſtreſs's Diſorders; bur they were both ſo full of their Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt Mr. <hi>Duroy,</hi> that I could learn but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from them.</p>
            <p>The Hopes and Expectations of moſt Women are too violent to be baulk'd, and when they meet with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0544800100:9"/>Diſappointments, their ſoft delicate Natures are the leaſt able to bear them; they never fail to occaſion great Diſorders, both in Body and Mind, let the Object be never ſo trifling. The chief Cauſe of Mrs. <hi>Duroy</hi>'s Sickneſs, by what I could gather, proceeded from the Want of the Gold Watch, a thing ſhe had ſet her Heart very much upon, and perhaps had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Ideas</hi> of inſulting ſome of her Neighbours, who had got the ſtart of her in other Reſpects. I found her Caſe to be much the ſame with that of Lady <hi>Arabella,</hi> and therefore put her under the ſame Method of Cure. The Accident which happened to that Lady, put me alſo upon a Stratagem which I managed, ſo as to be of Benefit to her, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had like to have coſt the other her Life. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes ſo much to wear off a ſettled Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as the giving Birth to ſome new Paſſion. I told her there was a very dangerous Sickneſs in Town, and tho' ſhe was altogether free from any Symptoms of it, yet it behov'd her not to give Way to fretting, otherwiſe I could not promiſe what might follow. Upon this both ſhe and her Nurſe were qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, Mrs. <hi>Duroy</hi>'s Sorrow and Diſcontent was changed into a moderate Fear, which ſoon wore off, and now ſhe is ſo well, as to attend her Husband's Buſineſs in his Abſence.</p>
            <p>This Week I was call'd to ſeveral other Women in the ſame Condition, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Wife of a Sales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Long-lane,</hi> who had rail'd at her Husband for ſelling old Rags, when others were getting Eſtates in the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> and ſetting up their Coaches. The Wife of <hi>John Tape,</hi> Haberdaſher of Small-Wares, who, by the Loſſes her Husband had ſuſtain'd in the Bubbles, was diſappointed of a Diamond-Ring, a new white Damask Gown and Petticoat, and a large Silver Cup, which ſhe intended againſt her next Lying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But there is one Circumſtance which ought not to be omitted, becauſe it contributed very much to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0544800100:10"/>the Aggravation of her Diſtemper, and that was her Husband's ill Uſage. It ſeems ſhe had been the Cauſe of his going into the Bubbles; and from the Time they ſunk, he never ceas'd upbraiding her with her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Finery, until he made the poor Woman not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcarry, but in that Weakneſs almoſt diſtracted. <hi>Martha Firkin,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Jonathan Firkin,</hi> Cheeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and <hi>Mary Pickle,</hi> the Wife of <hi>James Pickle,</hi> Salter, were alſo in a miſerable Condition. I found both theſe good Women had perſuaded their Husbands very earneſtly not to meddle with the Stocks. But the one had promis'd his Wife a new Damask-Bed for the beſt Chamber, and an eaſy Chair of the ſame, with a Carpet for the Dining-Room; and the other had bought his Wife a Set of new China, with half a dozen new-faſhion'd Spoons, a Silver Tea-Pot, and a Soop-Ladle; but the Misfortunes thoſe Men had drawn upon themſelves, had been the Cauſe of their Wives Diſorders.</p>
            <p>Moſt of theſe have ſucceeded very well under my Care; but there was a Number of others who are like to continue in a miſerable Condition, whoſe Names I have omitted out of Tenderneſs, becauſe I found them ſubject to an Infirmity which is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becoming their Sex; and that is, an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and immoderate Uſe of ſpirituous Liquors. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo deſtructive to hyſterical Women as Drams; and yet, from a kind of craving Neceſſity, they are apt to have Recourſe to them in their Languors and ſinking Fits, which confirm them ſo into a Habit, that they return upon every Surprize, or upon the leaſt ſlight Diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 7. I was call'd to <hi>T'. M.</hi> Gent. aged 39. of a thin ſpare talliſh Body, and of a pale Complexion. When I firſt enter'd the Room, I was ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd; his Head was as large as a Porridge-pot; for he had got five or ſix Woollen Caps upon it, over all which was another lin'd with Fur; upon his Body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0544800100:11"/>were ſeveral Flannel Waſtcoats, a Caſſock of thick Cloth, with a thick wadded Gown, and about his Shoulders the Quilt which he had taken from off the Bed. A Gentleman, who was ſitting by him, ſeeing me look upon him with ſome Earneſtneſs, burſt out into a Fit of Laughter, which gave great Offence to my Patient, who, till then, was ſcarce able to ſpeak. This unſeaſonable Mirth in his Friend put him into ſuch a Diſorder, that I ſoon perceiv'd what his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition was, and likewiſe that he had been ſome time a <hi>Valetudinarian.</hi> I advis'd him not to give way to Paſſion, telling him it would waſte his Spirits, and then I took an Opportunity to ask him how long he had been ill. He was ſo much out of Breath, that it was ſome time before he could make me any Anſwer, but, as ſoon as he was able, he told me he had been bad about a fortnight; whereupon his Friend ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to put in another Word, and ſaid, to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he had not been in perfect Health theſe ſeven Years. This exaſperated my Patient to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he gave the other the Lie. Was not I, ſays he, as well as you, or any Man alive, for three or four Months together? did I not go every Day to <hi>Change,</hi> eat roaſt Beef, and drink Claret? nay we eat ſalt Beef, or roaſted Pork, or any other Thing we could get. Now, Sir, I'll be judg'd by you, whether any Man that is not in perfect Health, could digeſt thoſe Things. I made Anſwer, not very well. But as all this was little to the Purpoſe, I deſired to know where the greateſt of his Trouble lay at preſent; but the Gentleman had not yet put an End to his Diſcourſe. Could any Man that has the leaſt Indiſpoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, eat Beans and Bacon, Green Peaſe, Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, and Cabbages; any ſuch Traſh would at this time kill me in leſs than twelve Hours. I told him thoſe Things were generally accounted windy, and for that Reaſon, prejudicial to Perſons in thoſe Circumſtances I judg'd him to be in. Whereupon I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0544800100:12"/>ask'd him if he was not ſometimes troubled with Cholick Pains. Oh! always Sir, ſays he, never without them. Then I ask'd if he had not a Pain, or rather a Weight and Uneaſineſs on his left Side. At that Queſtion his Colour chang'd, his Hands trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and I perceived at the ſame Time a univerſal Diſorder; But recovering a little, he went into the Cloſet, and brought out three or four Pots and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one after another, in which he had made Water at ſeveral Times. I perceive, ſays he, you have the ſame Notion of my Diſtemper, that ſeveral others of your Profeſſion have had; you fancy I have got the Spleen, and that all my Ailments are imaginary; but I'll aſſure you, Sir, you'll find your ſelf miſtaken. Don't you ſee there, how clear my Water is? there is not the leaſt Sign of Concoction in it; I am told it prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticates a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and I expect every Minute when I ſhall be out of my Senſes. Feel my Pulſe, what a burning Fever I have upon me. Upon this I took hold of his Arm, and told him it was fitter for him to be in Bed than up; for it was then very late. But, ſays he, I cannot lie in Bed as thoſe do, that love to indulge themſelves; and for that Reaſon, moſt People think nothing ails me, but that I only fancy my ſelf to be bad. I made Anſwer, that thoſe Perſons were much miſtaken, that he was indeed very ill, tho' to the beſt of my Judgment, I could not ſay he was in Danger. I told him that I would viſit him early next Morning; but as yet, it was not proper to preſcribe any Thing for him, excepting only white Wine and Water, which I order'd him to drink.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman has been a Valetudinarian from his Youth, which proceeded from a natural Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that ought to have been broke and overcome by Buſineſs; but as he had a ſufficient Patrimony, he gave himſelf wholly up to Idleneſs, and would ſeldom go abroad, either upon his neceſſary Affairs, or for his Diverſion; yet the natural Love and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0544800100:13"/>to his own Perſon, made him feed plentifully, tho' he had no Exerciſe or Imployment to digeſt it. This had laid the Foundation of his Diſtemper; by which Means, he became alſo unfit for any of the Offices of Life; for as he had, in a manner, ſequeſter'd himſelf from the Society of Mankind, ſo nothing was more burdenſom to him than Company; neither was this to be wondered at, for he was grown the Jeſt and Diverſion of all his Acquaintance. And as the Mind ſoon takes Part in all ſuch Indiſpoſitions, this ſolitary Perſon's Imaginations became exceedingly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and his whole Thoughts were center'd upon his own Condition, which he now believes to be the moſt unhappy of any Man alive. The nobler Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are quite extinguiſhed and ſunk, in the Exceſſes of Fear, Sorrow, and Anguiſh of Heart, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch dreadful Images before him, as caſt a Gloom upon the whole Face of Nature, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can reliſh with him: And albeit this Diſpoſition of Mind makes him ſhun Company, yet the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Death, or ſome ſudden Diſaſter, works ſo powerfully upon him, that he can never be alone, but muſt always have ſome near Relation or old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, who is not a Stranger to his Condition, tho' even that Perſon, notwithſtanding all his good Offices, muſt be a Slave to his Humours. His way of thinking is become different from that of all other Men, yet he judges himſelf ſo abſolutely right in all his Apprehenſions, that if his Friend contradicts him in any Thing, he believes it either in Deriſion of him, or out of Ignorance.</p>
            <p>Thus much I learned of his Friend, who was alſo his near Relation, and had indeed judg'd accurately enough of his Couſin's Condition, which ſeems to be the more evident, from the extraordinary Alteration that happened to him, while he frequented the Alley, and was engaged in Buſineſs. The Diſappointments he met with there, were the Occaſion of his ſudden
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0544800100:14"/>Relapſe; but a Man in his Circumſtances could never be happy, had ev'ry Thing he propos'd to himſelf anſwered to his Wiſhes; for as all his Labour tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to a further Gratification of his indolent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, he muſt by degrees have fal'n back into his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Diſorders, only that a more plentiful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might, in Time, have increas'd his Maladies, inſtead of leſſening them. Neither is this altogether improbable, from what his Friend further told me, concerning ſome Reſolutions he had taken. He bought a piece of Ground, on which if his Affairs had ſucceeded, he deſign'd to have built a Houſe, or rather a Caſtle, for the Walls were to have been four Foot thick, and under the Lining, they were to be laid over with Pitch and Bitumen, the Windows were all to be double glaz'd, and the inner Doors to draw up and down like Saſhes. He ſaid this was the ancient Way of Building, and Men liv'd then to a much greater Age, and more healthful than now, that the unwholſome Damps come through our thin Walls.</p>
            <p>After hearing thoſe things, I very reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of doing Service to a Man who had given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up wholly to his own deluded Imaginations. But according to my Promiſe, I waited on him next Morning, where his Friend was ſo kind as to meet me. It was broad Day when I came to the Houſe, but the Windows were all ſhut as at Midnight, with a Candle burning on the Table. I ask'd if he was not almoſt ſtifled for want of Air: But this prov'd to be an unſeaſonable Queſtion, for he was out of Humor with his Friend, who juſt before had been telling him how dangerous it would be to burn Candles Night and Day in his new Houſe, where there was to be ſo much combuſtible Matter. This had put him into a very great Paſſion; but as ſoon as I came to know the Cauſe of it, I ſtudy'd to pacify him, telling him his Friend did that only out of good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0544800100:15"/>to divert him in his Sickneſs, and that he ought to take it in good part. After this, I ask'd him how he had reſted all Night; he told me very badly, but that the Apothecary had miſtaken his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that it was very ſtrange no Body could find out what the Matter was with him; whereupon he went again into his Cloſet, and brought the Water which he had made in the Night. See you, Sir, ſays he, with abundance of Terror in his Looks, whether I be a Man for this World or not; Sir, you are a Phyſician, I know you are not afraid to dip your Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into it, and taſte it, you will find it as ſweet as any Well-Water. I was ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at this odd Notion, and how it had come into his Head, for there was nothing in the Water but what was common to Hypochondriacal Perſons, who, when their Diſorders are much upon 'em, make large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Water, which is alſo very clear. But a Gentleman had ſent his Servant that Morning, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how he did, who came in about the Time he was taking a Survey of his Baſons, and ſeeing a great Quantity of clear Water, took it to be the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, the laſt Maſter he had ſerv'd, dy'd of, which he told him was a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> and that the Doctors us'd to taſte it every Time they came to ſee him, and always ſaid he would die, becauſe there was no Salt in it. I us'd all the Arguments I could, to beat this Whim out of his Head, but to no purpoſe, it being but new; I ordered what was proper for him, and left him for two or three Days; but I found he could not be perſwaded to make Uſe of my Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but was now about to call another Phyſician, only that the Apothecary prevented him, by ſending him ſome Things he ſaid were proper in a <hi>Diabetes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I came again to viſit him, I found him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a freſh Diſorder, for what he had taken had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed put a Stop to the Diſcharges by Urine, but not the right Way; for he was now troubled with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0544800100:16"/>Defluxion, and he ſpit like one in a Salivation. Now, ſays he, I hope there needs be no further Doubt concerning my Diſtemper. You ſee, Sir, how faſt I am going; he had kept two or three Pieces of hard diſcolour'd Flegm in a Gallipot, which he took to be ſome of his Lungs: But when we came to examine them, they were diſſolv'd: Whereupon I told him, there was nothing here but Flegm; and that I hoped his Lungs were not ſo bad as he imagin'd. But all this would not ſatisfy him; for he fancied the Cat, or ſome Dog, had been in the Room, and had taken 'em out. I order'd that Night a Draught, and bid him be of good Cheer, telling him, that he was not in ſo imminent Danger as he apprehended. At this he was a little reviv'd, and ask'd me, if any Man could live after part of his Lungs were come up? O! yes, ſays I, never fear. I had order'd the Draught to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the Night following; ſo that I did not ſee him for two Days more.</p>
            <p>When I came the fourth Time, all things were much chang'd, and thoſe Symptoms gone off. He was alſo very much metamorphos'd in his Apparel; for, inſtead of the Bed-Quilt, which he us'd to wear about his Shoulders, he was now cover'd with a Bear's Skin. His Friend was along with him, and ſeeing me look earneſtly upon him, as I did at firſt, he could not again refrain from Laughter; and addreſſing himſelf to me, Had my Couſin, ſays he, been cloath'd in a Lion's Skin, as he is now in that of a Bear, you would undoubtedly have taken him for a ſecond <hi>Hercules.</hi> But this was the Cauſe of freſh Heat in my Patient, who told his Friend, with a great deal of Paſſion, that tho' he was forc'd to wear a Bear's Skin out of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yet it would become him much better, ſince he was as ſavage as the Creature to which it belong'd. But I interrupted the Diſpute, and then ask'd the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, how he did? He told me, he was ſomething better, and that he had got this Skin to wear about
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0544800100:17"/>him, becauſe he found the Quilt too heavy. When I was about to take my Leave of him, he told me with ſome Compliment, that I needed not give myſelf the Trouble to make him any more regular Viſits; for he hop'd he was in a fair way to do well. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I parted, with a Congratulation for the promiſing Signs of his Recovery.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I was gone, the Gentleman's Friend fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me to a Coffee-Houſe I uſually frequent, and gave me an Account of a new Prepoſſeſſion had pleas'd his Couſin wonderfully; but that he was aſham'd to mention it to me, becauſe he had been ſo often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. It ſeems, while the Spitting continu'd, the Thoughts of his Lungs coming up had frightened him to ſuch a Degree, that notwithſtanding he was grown a great deal better by the Things I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him, yet he ſent for a Scrivener to make his Will. When the Scrivener came, they were under ſome Difficulty how to diſpoſe of his Subſtance among his Friends; it being impoſſible to know what he was worth; for all he had was in the <hi>South-Sea;</hi> but he fell upon a Contrivance of his own, and told the Scrivener, he would have it made into ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidends (for theſe are Words he had been much us'd to of late) he would give a third Part to one, a fourth to another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Scrivener, who was not accuſtom'd to any thing out of the common Form, told him, all his Goods and Chattels, and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sum, ought to be ſpecify'd, otherwiſe it wou'd only occaſion Law-Suits among his Relations, after he was dead. At that Word he ſtarted, and began to look pale; for he could never hear of Death without very great Diſorders. A Neighbour, who was call'd up to atteſt the Will, and who, 'till now, could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe him to be in good earneſt, ask'd him, what his Sickneſs was? He made Anſwer, that he firſt had a <hi>Fever,</hi> and then a <hi>Diabetes,</hi> and was now fallen into a deep <hi>Conſumption;</hi> and that he was, notwithſtanding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0544800100:18"/>all thoſe Afflictions, tormented with an inſupportable Pain in his Bowels. Upon this, his Neighbour told him, he knew a Man who was juſt in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for a great while together, and had been in the Hands of a great many Doctors, but none of them could do him any Good, 'till at laſt he met with one who made him wear a Tyger's Skin, with the hairy ſide outmoſt, and in a few Days he voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Worm Thirty ſix Yards and an Inch long, and has been as well ſince as any Man alive. This Story work'd ſo powerfully upon his Imagination, that he ſoon believ'd he had got ſuch a Worm within him, and every Time his Guts growl'd, he fancy'd he felt it move. He ſent all over the Town for a Tyger's Skin, but at that Time there was none to be had; but a Furrier, who came to know what it was for, and interpreting all this to be nothing but a Piece of Lunacy, and that the Worm was rather in his Head than his Belly, perſwaded him that a Bear's Skin would do as well, and that he had ſold ſeveral for the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This his Friend told me was the true Reaſon of his wearing the Bears Skin, and why he was now become ſo ſhy and indifferent about my further viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, having from thence conceiv'd unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hopes of his doing well. And moreover, that he was in ſo conſtant an Expectation of his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he had provided a new Cloſe-ſtool, with a Pan big enough to receive the Worm; and that all the Family was call'd together as often as he went to it, that they might be Witneſſes thereof.</p>
            <p>In this Condition I left him; but I have been ſince inform'd, that the Cure has not ſucceeded to his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, tho' he is ſtill ſo much taken with the Fancy, that he has now apply'd himſelf to Mr. <hi>John Moor</hi> Apothecary in <hi>Abchurch-lane,</hi> in order to have ſome Doſes of his Worm Powder.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Penelope</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0544800100:19"/>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Penelope Whitewaſh,</hi> a Maiden Lady, aged 38, was miſerably afflicted with the Vapours. Another Phyſician had been employ'd before I was call'd to her; but ſhe told me he had preſcrib'd nothing but a Bottle of Drops to drink with her Tea, and that ſhe believ'd he did not imagine how bad ſhe was, for he came but ſeldom, and then made very light of her Indiſpoſition. Upon this I deſired to know where moſt of her Trouble lay. Indeed, Sir, ſays ſhe, there are many Things trouble me, but that which lies heavieſt upon me at preſent, is a continual Faintneſs; and the Apothecary tells me I have got a Fever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirits. I went to draw my Chair near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take hold of her Wriſt, in order to feel her Pulſe. But this had like to have caus'd a very great Diſturbance, for the Chair pinch'd the Foot of a little Dog, who had been ſome time ſcrambling about my Legs, but was now lain down under it to reſt him. This put the Lady into a great Fright, and made her call out ſo loud, that her Spirits indeed ſuffered very much by it; but when ſhe found the Dog was not hurt, ſhe ſoon recovered, and told him he was very naughty to be always in Peoples Way, and bid him not go near the Gentleman's Chair any more: Then ſhe addreſs'd her ſelf to me, and told me, the only thing that made her have a Concern for that Dog was, becauſe he came of a Bitch which had been her Mother's; with that ſhe fetch'd a deep Sigh, and began to be ſomewhat diſorder'd, and ask'd a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who was by, for her Bottle, that ſhe might ſmell to it. I bid the Lady be of good Courage, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, that I hop'd there was no Danger; and that I would order ſome Things would ſoon relieve her; and accordingly I preſcrib'd her ſome Pills, with a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick Mixture, and then left her. When I was got down Stairs into the Entry, an elderly Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man met me, (who I underſtood to be the Landla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) and ask'd what I thought of Madam. I told
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0544800100:20"/>her, ſhe would, in all probability, do well again. Indeed, Sir, ſays the Gentlewoman, ſhe frighten'd us all laſt Night; for ſhe happen'd to ſee a Shrowd on the Candle, and I cannot tell what may be in it, but ſhe believes ever ſince, that ſhe is a dying; for ſhe ſays, her Mother ſaw juſt ſuch another but a little before her Death. I told her, there was nothing in that. It may be ſo, reply'd the old Gentlewoman, and I believe it is only a Cold ſhe has got lately, when they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all this ſtir about the <hi>Stock-Jobbers;</hi> for then ſhe us'd to dreſs every Day, and go into the City; and I perceive ſhe has never been to call well ſince. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, ſaid I, and with that I went out of Doors.</p>
            <p>Next Morning, I made the Lady another Viſit. When I firſt enter'd the Room, the Lady told me, ſhe was aſham'd; for ſhe was ſo bad that ſhe could not put on clean Things, but was forc'd to be in that dirty pickle. Pray, Madam, ſaid I, make no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; for we never expect to find ſick Perſons dreſs'd. She had got the Landlady's Daughter to keep her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and an ordinary Woman, with a Pot of Coffee before 'em; which gave me an Opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Coffee was generally look'd upon to be bad for Perſons in her Circumſtances. But the Lady made Anſwer, that ſhe had not been drinking any of it herſelf, but had only provided it for Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> and that good Woman, who was ſo kind as to come now and then to divert her. I told her, nothing would do her more Service than chearful Company. Upon this, ſhe ask'd me, if I lik'd Coffee? And whether I would be pleas'd to accept of a Diſh? I very ſeldom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with my Patients in things of this kind; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cold raw Day, I drank one Diſh, which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pour'd out for me; and as ſoon as I had empty'd my Cup, and that they found I was unwilling to have it fill'd again, I obſerv'd the Landlady's Daughter take it up, and turn it round four or five ſeveral times,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0544800100:21"/>looking earneſtly into it all the while: But the good Woman frown'd, and knit her Brows at her, and wink'd to my Patient, while the other was ſo intent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her Obſervations, that ſhe took no Notice, 'till at laſt ſhe was pull'd by her Petticoat; whereupon ſhe ſet down the Cup, and I perceiv'd ſhe was at ſome Pains to ſmother a Laugh. By this time I had ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Lady in all the Queſtions ſhe had put to me concerning her Indiſpoſition; and it being full time for me to be gone, I left her. When I was got to the other ſide of the Door, the young Woman fell a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, and I over-heard her call to the Lady and the other Woman, to come and ſee what a large Pair of Horns there was in the Doctor's Cup. But as I am never offended at young's People's Mirth, I took no Notice, but went down Stairs into the Entry, where the Landlady was again come to meet me. She ask'd how I lik'd Madam to day? I told her, ſhe ſeem'd to be a little more chearful; but that I was afraid ſhe did herſelf Harm by drinking too much Coffee, tho' ſhe was not willing to own it. But the Landlady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd what the Lady had ſaid, and told me, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſeldom drinks any herſelf; but this Morning, ſhe had a Pot made for that Woman, whom ſhe gave me to underſtand was a Fortune-Teller, and one who knew every thing by looking into the Coffee-Grounds. That, I ſaid, was indeed a way of Divining I had never heard of before. Then I ask'd what ſhe had told the Lady? Nay, anſwer'd the old Woman, I cannot ſay to you what may be in it; but ſhe tells Madam, ſhe always ſees a Coach and Six in her Cup; and that ſhe is ſure the <hi>South-Sea</hi> will riſe to 1500 by <hi>Candlemas</hi> next; and in a little time after, ſhe will be married to a warm elderly Gentleman; and we believe it muſt be her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, who comes very often in the Afternoon to play at Cards with her; for he is juſt ſuch a Gentleman as ſhe deſcribes. She tells my Girl too, that ſhe is to be married to a fine proper young Man in a little
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0544800100:22"/>time, who will make her a very good Husband; that ſhe will have ſeveral fine Children, and want for nothing that any Woman can deſire; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch Things, which, you know, pleaſes young People. Very true, ſaid I, and ſo bid her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt Viſit I made Mrs. <hi>White-waſh;</hi> for I found ſhe had received no ſmall Benefit from the Fortune-teller's favourable Deluſions, which, altho' they were practiſed with the moſt abſurd and ſilly Device in the World, yet all were ſo artfully ſuited to the Lady's moſt earneſt Deſires and Inclinations, that they eaſily gain'd upon her Credulity, and will ſerve for a Seaſon, to keep off that threatning Storm, which, in all probability, muſt fall ſo much the more heavy upon her, by how much her Expectations have been rais'd and exalted.</p>
            <p>The following Week, which in my Account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the 15th of <hi>October,</hi> prov'd a Time of ſo much Buſineſs, that I never remember the like ſince I was able to practiſe; I had little or no Reſt, but was ſent for to all Quarters of the Town, and to many Perſons of the beſt Rank; and every Time I came Home, I found my Houſe throng'd with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of inferior Degree, ſome of whom had been deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engag'd in the Bubbles, but moſt were Tradeſmen, who had ſuſtain'd great Loſſes, by furniſhing thoſe with Equipages, who had not as yet been in any Decorum ſuitable to their new Acquiſitions: A few of the latter were indeed ſo happy as to be engag'd in full Buſineſs, and had their Heads turn'd upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to retrieve their Loſſes, which had diverted their Minds, and kept off melancholy Thoughts; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t only came upon the Account of their Wives and Daughters, who had Time to think, and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid thoſe Things more to Heart. The Hurry I was now brought into, confounded me to ſuch a Degree, and the vaſt many miſerable Objects I had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0544800100:23"/>ſeen, dwelt ſo on my own Imagination, that I began to think the Diſtemper infectious; and for that Reaſon, I kept at Home one whole Day, and would not ſo much as ſuffer my Doors to be opened. But I was ſo much terrify'd at laſt, that I fell a trembling every time I heard any Body knock; and methought every Voice I heard in the Street nam'd Sir <hi>John Midriff.</hi> And juſt as I imagin'd, many of the Symptoms ſoon took hold of me, and no one can conceive the great Diſorders I labour'd under for the Space of fourteen Hours. I began alſo to think of the Coffee-Cup, and was angry, and ſnapt at my Wife every Time ſhe ſpoke to me. But after I had ſlept upon it, I ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd all my Reaſon, and found my Body was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, and that my Diſturbances were only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary; I put on a Reſolution not to give way to any ſuch Prepoſſeſſion, eſpecially at a time when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Objects call'd for my Aſſiſtance; I therefore dreſs'd my ſelf, and went abroad, as uſual, to viſit my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
            <p>The firſt I made this Week was to an old Uſurer, who had been no Proprietor in the Stocks; but had privately lent very near 12000 <hi>l.</hi> at 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and had himſelf paid at the Rate of 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for a good Part of that Money, which he was afraid would all be ſunk, becauſe both Debtors and Bondſmen were ſhipwreck'd, if not quite loſt in the <hi>South Sea.</hi> But this Gentleman was really altogether incurable, for he had liv'd very abſtemiouſly for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 20 Years; but, ſince his Loſſes, could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on to take any Suſtenance, excepting Bread and Water, for he was of Opinion he ought to faſt for his Folly. After I had made him two or three Viſits, and had acquainted him with the Hurry I was in, and that I was afraid I could not attend upon him any more, and when he found that I was juſt a going, he ſtop'd me, and putting on his Spectacles, he went to a Drawer, where I heard him chink over a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0544800100:24"/>great many Pieces, and after I had waited his Time, which was a pretty good while, he brought me a Quarter-guinea, and preſs'd it into the Hollow of my Hand, bidding me carry it home to my Wife for a Purſe-penny; and at the ſame time obſerv'd, that Gold was now-a-days become as rare as a Sallad at Chriſtmas. From him I went to a middle ag'd Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Lady, who was miſerably in the Vapours, for ſhe had ſold the Life-Rent of her Jointure for a ſmall Sum of Money, which ſhe put out to be improv'd, in order to marry a luſty young Man, an Attorney, who was her Steward, and did all her Buſineſs. From that Lady I went to a Frenchman, who is an Artiſt, and had work'd above 20 Years in a Garret, during which Time he had liv'd for the moſt part on Roots and Herbs, and ſometimes a little foetid Oyl for Sauce, whereby he had hoarded up ſome Money, but had loſt it all in the Bubbles. When I came to him, I ask'd what was the Matter with him. Oh—de Matter, Sir, ſaid he, I have got your D—md Angliſe Maladie, that makes your Man and Woman hang demſelves in de Room, and drown in de Water, and if I had been ane de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glisman I had certainly done my ſelf ſo too, for I have loſt all my Money and my Health. I could not but pity the poor Frenchman very much, for I underſtood he had been miſerably bit by Men whoſe Birth and Station ſhould have put them above ſuch Practices, and therefore I advis'd him to apply to his Buſineſs again, and I viſited him until he was pretty well, without taking any Fee of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Hazard</hi> Eſq; was alſo one of thoſe who uſher'd in this Week's Practice. He is a noted Gameſter, and has play'd away above two Thirds of a very handſome Eſtate, which was the Acquiſition of an old griping Uncle. The Remainder he diſpos'd of in the publick. This Gentleman, tho' he had gone through many Changes and Viciſſitudes, yet he was never ſo ſenſibly touch'd as with his late Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0544800100:25"/>becauſe he imagin'd himſelf arriv'd at that which he had been labouring for, early and late, ever ſince he was come to Man's Eſtate. I underſtood he had ſeveral grand Projects in view; but among others, had a particular Eye not only to ſome certain Men of Quality's Eſtates, but alſo to their Miſtreſſes, which he thought was only but throwing a lucky Main or two as ſoon as he was able to enter the Liſts with them. But although his Diſtemper was exceeding violent, and was alſo much heightned by Paſſion; yet it did not laſt long; for the next time I came to wait upon him, I found all things much alter'd; for he was whiſtling and ſinging, and practiſing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and with a couragious Air rattling and ſtriking the Dice-Box with great force upon the Table; and as ſoon as he ſaw me, he call'd out, What do you think of your Patient now, Sir <hi>John?</hi> I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd myſelf well by Philoſophy; for I believe a Man of no Eſtate has as much Pleaſure in winning two or three Yellow-Boys, as a rich Man when he caſts up a Thouſand Pounds; and I am of opinion, a Man may have as much Satisfaction in a neat clean Wench in a Callico-Gown and Petticoat, as with a Lord's Miſtreſs, who has perhaps no more to ſet her off, than only that ſhe is a Nobleman's Choice; and for that Reaſon, is kept fine, like a Lady, and at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Vulgar. Upon this I could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect in my own Mind, what Numbers of Perſons were ſupported in their Folly by a vicious Application of Philoſophical Maxims and Rules; but I made anſwer with a Smile, That I was not much acquainted with that Kind of Philoſophy. This was anſwer'd with a loud Laugh from my Patient; and as ſoon as he had recover'd himſelf, that we had Time to exchange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, I took my Leave; for I found he was not ſuſceptible of very laſting Impreſſions to hurt him, but was harden'd in the Ways of Iniquity, which were almoſt equal to him, whether in a higher or lower Capacity.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0544800100:26"/>
            <p>The next remarkable Patient was a famous <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Teacher,</hi> who had acquir'd a conſiderable Fortune, which had enabled him to become a no ſmall Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in the <hi>South-Sea.</hi> This had laid the Foundation of all his Illneſs; but there were other Circumſtances that contributed to keep up his Diſorders. When I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd into his Condition, and found him to be touch'd with the Spleen, I thought it might be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do him ſervice, as he ſeem'd to be a Man of ſome Senſe and Learning; and therefore ſpoke my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents freely, telling him, he ought not to mind his Diſappointments, ſo as to give way to diſorderly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations. But he made Anſwer, that theſe were at this time the leaſt of his Care; tho' he could not but own, they had made ſome deep Impreſſions on him at firſt; but that now he found his Body very much diſtemper'd, and there muſt be ſome uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Method taken for his Recovery, otherwiſe he would ſoon become one of the unhappieſt Men alive. Thoſe Expreſſions are ſo uſual from Hypochondriack Perſons, that I gave little ear to them, but perſiſted in my former Advice; and after I had order'd him ſome Cephalicks, I left him.</p>
            <p>After this, I viſited him ſeveral Days, but found him always harping on the ſame String, which made me ſomewhat more inquiſitive than I had been before. He told me, he had ſometimes a grievous Pain in his Head, ſometimes in his Shoulders, and very often in his Shin Bones; and, indeed, Sir, ſaid he, you will hardly imagine what a miſerable Condition I am in. There was ſtill none of thoſe Symptoms but may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Hypochondriack Perſons; and therefore I us'd ſeveral freſh Arguments to fortify him againſt his groundleſs Apprehenſions; but when Men are once given up to the Deluſions that attend this gloomy Diſtemper, they become ſo much enſlav'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Fear, that every Idea preſents ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto them that is dreadful; a great many new
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0544800100:27"/>Diſaſters are daily form'd, which have no real Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in their diſtemper'd Imaginations; and many old Afflictions, which had long been vanquiſh'd, are aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'d with ſuch a Train of Aggravations, that they render Life no better than a tormenting Dream.</p>
            <p>This was now become the Caſe of our Parſon, who had indeed got the better of thoſe Impreſſions which had at firſt given Birth to his Diſorders; but it was by others that were much more dreadful. He would often begin to diſcloſe himſelf to me, but ſomething always prevented him; his Colour often left him, his Hands ſhook, and I obſerv'd him to be under the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Diſturbance imaginable. I muſt confeſs, it gave me ſome Uneaſineſs to ſee the Reverend Divine in all this Confuſion; whereupon, I ſpoke to him with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Tenderneſs, intreating him not to be too reſerv'd, but to tell me freely what it was troubled him ſo much. Sir, ſaid he, you cannot probably have any Suſpicion of what I am now going to acquaint you with; and if I was to give you all the Signs of my Diſtemper, they might indeed puzzle you; but you would hardly gueſs at it, as it is a Malady very unbecoming one of my Calling, nor any ways agreeable to the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have always had among Men. By theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I began to think he had, perhaps, been lately in Liquor, and had fallen into the Hands of ſome lewd Woman. Whereupon, I conjur'd him not to hide any thing from me; but if he had receiv'd any Injury from that Sex, to confeſs freely. The Ice being now broke, he ſhook his Head, and told me, it was a great deal worſe than I could imagine; for the Diſtemper had lain in his Blood above Twenty Years. I got it, ſaid he, when I was a young raw Student, and I am afraid, by what I find now, I have never been rightly cur'd of it. I ask'd him, why he had been ſo negligent not to have it cur'd all that while; and at the ſame time I obſerv'd to him, that he did not look like one who had lain under that Diſtemper. To this he ſaid,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0544800100:28"/>he had been as well as any Man till lately, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow he was ſure the latent Poiſon had begun to work, and was got into his Bones, which muſt no doubt be the Reaſon why he oftentimes felt ſo great Pain in them. But when I was going to undeceive him in this Particular, he put a Stop to me, and ſaid, if the Diſtemper ſhould break out upon him at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uncture, it was but a juſt Puniſhment for his Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>rror in this Particular, and had even acted in ſome Meaſure againſt the Dictates of his better Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ndeed do better, than to make a religious Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his Afflictions; but yet, I ſaid the loſs of his Money ſeem'd to be the real and moſt ſenſible Puniſhment he underwent at preſent, for in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to his Perſon, I ſaid I could not perceive any Thing amiſs with him. But all this did not give him any great Satisfaction, for he was alſo under no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mall Anxiety about his Wife, to think that ſhe ſhould ſuffer innocently on his Account. He told me ſhe had likewiſe been very much troubled with the Head-ach of late, and had broke out all about her Mouth, and that ſhe complain'd greatly of a ſinking in her Spirits; but I found his Wife was only in the Vapours, as himſelf was in the Spleen, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0544800100:29"/>I gave him to underſtand, that thoſe Diſorders were no other than what are common to moſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when any Thing troubles them. Upon this he paus'd a while, for he was ſenſible ſhe had laid their late Diſappointments pretty much to Heart; but there was one Circumſtance that ſtill terrify'd him more than all the reſt, he had got two or three Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on his Fore-head, which he imagin'd certainly to be the Effects of the Diſtemper; and I believe no grave Man before him ever conſulted the Glaſs ſo much as he had done while he was under this Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; for all the Time I was with him, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pulling back his Wig to examine thoſe Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as often as he put his Hands upon them, he remain'd ſpeechleſs for a Minute or two, and ſometimes he alſo felt his Noſe, leſt any Thing ſhould be amiſs there. But at length aſſuming a little more Courage, he addreſs'd himſelf to me in this Manner: I doubt, Sir, ſaid he, tho' you are deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly reputed a very great Phyſician, you may, however, be unacquainted with my Caſe; for if I be not miſtaken, I believe it is more in the Way of a Surgeon than in yours. I made Anſwer, that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Caſes, if he meant thoſe, were no leſs the Buſineſs of a Phyſician, than any other, and that Recourſe was commonly had to ſome one of our Profeſſion, when they prov'd too hard and difficult for the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to manage. Pray then, Sir, ſaid he, pointing to his Fore-head, what do you think can be the Meaning of theſe Blotches? don't you believe there muſt be ſomething more than <hi>ordinary</hi> in them? I told him they were nothing but what ev'ry one was ſubject to as well as he, upon catching Cold, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſlight Diſorder; and I obſerv'd that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper could not conceal it ſelf ſo long as he fancied, without making ſome Havock upon the Conſtitution, and therefore beg'd him to reſt ſatisfy'd, and not tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himſelf with ſuch Whims and Imaginations. But
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0544800100:30"/>to convince me they were no Whims, he took a Key out of his Pocket and opened a Drawer, where there were ſome Books with the Leaves folded in ſeveral Places, among which was <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Treatiſe of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Diſeaſe,</hi> where he ſhew'd me ſeveral Inſtances of Perſons who had that Diſtemper lurking many Years in their Blood. But I told him it was a Loſs to any one, and even to Men of Learning, to read Books of Phyſick, unleſs they had made that their particular Study, for they might very readily fall upon bad Authors, and even on ſcandalous Books that had been writ upon ſome Deſign, and that many a one had been ſo much terrify'd with the falſe or injudicious Inſtances in thoſe Books, that altho' they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from that Diſtemper, yet they could never be eaſy till they came into the Hands of thoſe who would put them unneceſſarily under the Grand Cure, and therefore I bid him reſt ſatisfy'd, unleſs he had been lately tranſgreſſing. But at this he lifted up his Hands, and gave me to underſtand he had been married upwards of 20 Years, and aſſur'd me upon his Honour, that he never had any Thing to do with any Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Wife all that Time. But Sir, ſays he, my Wife is a very likely Woman, and what can be the Reaſon I could never have a Child by her? I ſatisfy'd him that was no Rule, for there were many Inſtances of that kind, where neither the Man nor Woman were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, tho' there might be ſome natural Defect, which moſt commonly lies in the Woman; and on the other Hand, that there were alſo many Inſtances of vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Perſons, who had begot Children even when the Infection had ſpread it ſelf in the Blood. And do you think, ſaid he, that my Wife may be ſafe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, and that ſhe can be in no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the future? I made Anſwer there was no Manner of Danger; for I could diſcover nothing in his Caſe that could be the leaſt injurious to her. This put ſo much new Life into the good Man, that he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0544800100:31"/>was even like to leap out of his Skin, and in a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport of Joy told me I was his Friend, his Father Confeſſor, and the rareſt Man in the World, for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering him out of all his Fears, by ſuch ſolid and convincing Arguments. After which he began to tell me of the melancholy and frightful Ideas he had lately foſtered in his Breaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> what his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and all other ſober Diſſenters would have thought of him, what his Friends and Acquaintance among the Miniſters, what a Wound it would have been to Religion, eſpecially ſince his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation had hitherto been unſpotted as to the World. Had People once got a Notion of my having the foul Diſtemper, continued he, I ſhould never have been able to look up any more; but now you give me ſo much Comfort, that I even deſpiſe all my late Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; and upon this he embraced me with the greateſt Tokens of Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>But as no Tranſport can continue long without ſome Change or Interruption, this venerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Joys were ſoon turn'd into a pannick Fear; for while he and I were in this pleaſing Conference, we were unexpectedly ſurpriz'd by another Teacher who came to ſee him, and had drop'd in upon us before we were aware of him, who, ſeeing us engag'd, made a ſhort Compliment, and went directly to the Table where the Books lay, and taking up one of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to read where my Patient had folded the Leaves. Any one may eaſily imagine what a diſmal Condition the poor Parſon was in at this new Accident; he looked like one that was ready to go into his Grave, and ev'ry Time the other caſt his Eye off the Book to ſpit, or to take a Pinch of Snuff, he was like to ſink into the Ground, leſt he ſhould ask him Queſtions; but my being there prevented that, and as I had been the Inſtrument of delivering him out of his firſt Fears, I manag'd the Matter in ſuch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as brought him ſafely off, and delivered him out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0544800100:32"/>of the laſt too. When I roſe to go away, I deſir'd him to do me the Favour to give thoſe Books houſe-room for an Hour or two, until I could ſend my Servant for them, which he promis'd very obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſo I left him in a fair Way of doing well.</p>
            <p>I had many other Patients at this Time, beſides this reverend Teacher, who had been conſulting the Labours of Quacks and Mountebanks, and from thence tormenting themſelves with the Imagination of Symptoms and Diſeaſes they were altogether free from: Others were filled with the moſt monſtrous Conceits that perhaps were ever heard of. But this I obſerv'd was a Relief to many, and the Flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Imaginations not only preſerv'd them from deſperate Practices, but help'd greatly to wear out the firſt Impreſſions, by changing them into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which, as they were in themſelves abſurd and ridiculous, ſo they were the more eaſily vanquiſh'd and overcome. But it was quite otherwiſe with ſome, whoſe Expectations had been rais'd higher than to admit of any the leaſt Diſappointment. The ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Stop that was put to their ambitious Deſires, like an Eclipſe, had ſo darken'd their Reaſon, that, to them, all Things put on quite different Appearances from what they were really in Nature, and the Ideas of Things were altogether chang'd from what they had been formerly, on their own Imaginations. All their Paſſions were ſwallowed up in Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which in that total Darkneſs they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eager to practiſe upon themſelves, from Want of Power and Ability to exerciſe it on others.</p>
            <p>The following is an eminent Example of this kind, it being the Caſe of a Gentleman, who was a very conſiderable Adventurer in the <hi>South Sea,</hi> but had chiefly increaſed his Stock upon the Favour and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of others, and, from a Perſon of narrow Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was in a little Time advanced to a very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Fortune. But the higher the Precipice, the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0544800100:33"/>more terrible and dangerous the Fall. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had conceiv'd great Things from his new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions; but upon his being baulk'd and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was ſeiz'd with the worſt Diſorders that can happen to Mankind.</p>
            <p>When I came to viſit him, he look'd exceeding wild, and ſeem'd altogether out of his Senſes, ſo that I found it in vain to ask him any Queſtions; for he ſeldom made Anſwer, and when he did, it was little to the purpoſe: But one, whom he had lately hir'd to be his <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> gave me the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account of his Condition. He inform'd me, when the Stocks were high, his Maſter us'd to be at <hi>Change</hi> all Day, in a perpetual Hurry of Buſineſs, and at Night he drank very hard, went late to Bed, and was up again betimes in the Morning, ſo that he took very little Reſt, and was hardly cool for three Months together: He obſerv'd him to alter daily from what he was when he came firſt to live with him; for he was then a Man of a pretty even Temper; but lately, he ſaid he was ſometimes in ſuch Paſſions there was no ſpeaking to him, and at other times, he was ſo familiar and eaſy, that any one would have taken him to be the beſt natur'd Gentleman in the World. He told me he had beſpoke an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fine Coach, and a great deal of rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for which he was to pay a very high Price; ſome of theſe Goods were ſent home to him, and for others he had laid down Money before-hand: he had alſo bought an Eſtate of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, at 40 Years Purchaſe, to be paid upon drawing out his Money, which he intended againſt next <hi>Candlemaſs,</hi> and had laid himſelf under an Obligation of paying 10000 Pounds for Performance of his Contract. But his not being able to fulfil the half of his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Servant told me, had been the Cauſe of all his Diſorders, which, he ſaid, were become ſo great, that he was afraid to ſerve him any longer, for he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0544800100:34"/>had ſeveral times attempted to lay violent Hands on himſelf.</p>
            <p>I order'd him to be bled immediately, to be purg'd gently for ſeveral Days, and all that Time to make uſe of ſome Cephalicks, which I alſo preſcrib'd for him. I charg'd them to keep him from all manner of Noiſe and Company, and when I had alſo given Directions concerning his Diet, I left him.</p>
            <p>When I was got upon the Stairs, I heard a great Noiſe of Tongues in the Parlour, and above all the reſt, a Woman's Voice, who ſeem'd to be in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Sorrow and Affliction: One of the Servants told me, ſhe was his Miſtreſs, who, he ſaid, was ſo much engag'd, that ſhe could not come up Stairs while I was with his Maſter. As I was going along the Entry, I over-heard one ſay to her, I could have depended on your Husband, Madam, for more than I am worth in the World; ſays another, Your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band has quite ruin'd and undone me; I never made the leaſt doubt but he was worth 400000 <hi>l.</hi> a third call'd out, I will freely give you a Diſcharge in full, if you'll be ſo kind as to let me have my own Goods back again. As I went out of Doors, two Men that were leaning over the Pales, and look'd like Ruffians, ſtarted up; one of them made towards the Door; but the other call'd out, Back, (whom I perceiv'd to be a Bailiff) and as I croſs'd the Way to a Hackney-Coach that waited for a Fare, I obſerv'd two Men more, with great Sticks in their Hands, and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs about their Necks, ſtart from behind a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and were coming towards me; but another hem'd to them from an Ale-Houſe that was hard by, which turn'd them back again.</p>
            <p>When I was ſeated in the Coach, I deſired the Coachman to drive to Sir <hi>Anthony Wheel</hi>'s, where I had a Call to go with all poſſible Expedition. After which, I began to be in a great deal of Concern for the miſerable Condition of that Family, and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0544800100:35"/>that had lately been plung'd into the like Circumſtances, tho' at the ſame time, I could not but condemn the inconſiderate Raſhneſs and Folly of ſome of thoſe Perſons, as having brought an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Train of Evils upon themſelves. Their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were indeed great, but would not have been ſo, or perhaps none at all, had they not ty'd themſelves in a thouſand ridiculous Engagements, and, upon a falſe Preſumption of being rich, run into many unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Debts and Expences, which might have well been ſpar'd, till their Affairs were brought to a more certain Iſſue.</p>
            <p>While I was buſied in thoſe Reflections, the Coach ſtop'd, but could not come near the Door, becauſe of a great Crowd, who, hearing of Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, were gather'd about the Houſe to know how he did. But moſt of thoſe Perſons had earneſt Buſineſs with him, which made them ſo inquiſitive about his Health.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> is a Man advanc'd to that Period of Life, which, <hi>Horace</hi> tells us, is rul'd by Gain and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; he has been all along, 'till now, of a very healthful Conſtitution, which, no doubt, was owing to his way of Living; for he had been in conſtant Buſineſs of one kind or another from his Youth. He was taught betimes to read, write, and caſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; and upon his firſt ſetting out into the World, he was employ'd as a Secretary to many of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who had not the Advantage of ſo liberal an Education; wherein he acquitted himſelf ſo well, that it was reported of him, no Man could fill up a Bond or Indenture with greater Ability: But his main Talent lay in Accompts; and altho' he never was inſtructed under any Tutor, further than ſome few Decimal Fractions, yet he became exceedingly enamour'd with Figures, as they were the Types and Repreſentatives of that which he lov'd next to his Life. The Beauties that lay hid under thoſe pretty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0544800100:36"/>Devices were ſo great a Spur to his Induſtry, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould never give over varying their Poſitions, till he became more acquainted with the Powers of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers than any one before him, inſomuch that he was the firſt who diſcover'd to the World how many Changes might be rung on Twelve Bells. He was alſo ſaid to be the firſt who could practiſe <hi>Leger-du-Main</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Figures, and in this he even excell'd the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rated Artiſts; for moſt that thoſe Perſons could do, was only to bring Counters out of Peoples Pockets, and make them believe they were Money; But Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> could bring out real Sterling, and make them believe it to be only Counters, which he would in Time turn to Money.</p>
            <p>Theſe Accompliſhments ſoon brought him into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with a noted Magician of great Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who always practis'd with a <hi>Lituus,</hi> ſuch as the old Heathen Prieſts and Augurs were wont to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine with; and to him became an humble Servant for ſeveral Years, during which Time, he had alſo great Opportunities put into his Hands of growing both Rich and Powerful, and indeed no one ever improv'd his Opportunities better; for in a little Time he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs'd together ſuch a Heap of Treaſure, as has been ſeldom known in the Poſſeſſion of any private Perſon; and at length he became to be of ſuch Conſideration, that the Eyes of all Men were upon him, and thoſe who had not the Opportunity of converſing with him, ſtudied as much as poſſible to follow his Example.</p>
            <p>But this uncommon Regard, which the World paid him, at laſt prov'd his Bane; as it led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many Things that were ridiculous and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant; for he was proud and ambitious by Nature, which he improv'd to ſuch a Degree of Haughtineſs, that he even made Princes and Nobles ſtoop before him; and if any Man truly had his Ear, it was his old Maſter or his Friends, who ſeldom came openly, but were always convey'd to him by ſome magical
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0544800100:37"/>Device, which rendered them inviſible to others. His old Maſter was the only Perſon whom he ever admir'd for his great Abilities, but his Confidence in his own, at laſt very far overcame the Eſteem he had formerly of his Maſter's Talents; inſomuch that he has been known to laugh at him when his Back was turn'd, and to call him an ignorant Impoſtor; becauſe he had oftentimes help'd him out by his Numbers, when the Heavens preſented no favourable Omen. In fine, he became ſo preſumptuous, that he thought he could do every Thing by his Calculations, and even at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſquare the Circle; believing that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Task had been reſerv'd for him, becauſe the Circle bore ſome Analogy to his own Name.</p>
            <p>His ordinary Maxims were about Money, or the Relatives to it: He us'd to ſay, Money was the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Kings and Princes. That no Government could ſubſiſt without it. That it gave Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to all Men, and was ſo precious a Jewel, that ſo the World was kept in Ignorance, as to the Means, it ſignify'd but little how a Man came by it. That Wit was but a Flaſh, and thoſe Perſons were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor who had moſt of it, and that which Divines and Philoſophers call Wiſdom, was really Folly; for it was always accompany'd with ſuch a ſcrupulous Preciſeneſs, that it hindred Men from doing Juſtice to themſelves. That Modeſty, however admir'd by ſpeculative Perſons, was nevertheleſs unbecoming a Man, as it kept thoſe, who were reputed ſo, always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hatches; but that it was a Qualification well enough ſuited to Women. That all Learning, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which enabled a Man to look after his own Affairs, was no other than Madneſs; and ſerv'd only to make People troubleſome to themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>It was impoſſible, that a Man of this Turn and Diſpoſition ſhould lie idle and unactive in our national Concerns, after the extraordinary Footing they were lately put upon. He therefore appear'd among the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0544800100:38"/>firſt on the new Eſtabliſhment, and became one of the greateſt Adventurers, as he judg'd, nothing could be more likely to bring him to a full Gratification of his Wiſhes. But the ſudden and unexpected Turn of thoſe Affairs gave a deadly Blow to all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. Many of his Betters, who had ſome time ago ſtoop'd to his inſulting Arrogance, were now no ways backward in cenſuring his Conduct, and moſt Peoples Thoughts were filled with Jealouſy, that his Practices had not been ſo laudable as they ought to have been. His Abilities were alſo canvaſſed, and his laborious Calculations condemn'd as empty and chimerical. All which Afflictions coming together upon Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> brought him into a very bad State both in Body and Mind.</p>
            <p>When I enter'd his Room, I obſerv'd it was very ſpacious, and every Thing in it as ſumptuous as the rich Furniture deſcrib'd in <hi>Dido</hi>'s Palace. He was himſelf ſeated in a Chair covered with Crimſon Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, fring'd with Gold, and over his Head was a Canopy of the ſame finely wrought. I could not well at firſt divine, whoſe Preſence I was come into, and therefore I made him a more profound Obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance than what is uſually expected from one of my Profeſſion and Years. As ſoon as he ſaw me, he ask'd my Buſineſs. I told him I had a Meſſage that Morning from him, and was going to enquire into his Indiſpoſition; when he interrupted me, ſaying he had ſo many came to him upon Buſineſs and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that his Life was no better than that of a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Upon this he call'd his Servant to bid one of his Stewards come to him; whereupon an elderly Perſon ſoon entered the Room, whoſe Face I knew very well, and immediately I recollected, that I had ſeen him often upon the Exchange, and that he was a very noted Broker. He ask'd how much Stock he had ſold that Day? but the old Man tip'd him the Wink, and then went and whiſpered him in the Ear,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0544800100:39"/>yet ſo as I could overhear him. He told him there was no Market, and that the Buyers were all gone to the Devil, that now the Word ſignify'd nothing, for no body underſtood it. What, ſays he, not 1500 <hi>per Cent.</hi> againſt the Payment of the next Dividend? You may as well make People believe, reply'd the Man, that Stocks will riſe to 15000. Every one cries out, <hi>Who buys?</hi> But no body offers to bid any Thing. This brought Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> into a very great Diſorder, which was accompany'd with a boundleſs Fit of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He ſnatch'd up an Ink-ſtand that was on the Table, and was going to throw it at his Steward's Head; but I ſtep'd in between and prevented him; then he ask'd me who I was. What, ſays he, you are the Fellow that threaten'd to murder me the other Day, I'll have you ſecur'd this Minute. But I beg'd his Patience, and told him that I was a Phyſician; that I had practis'd in this City above five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, that my Name was <hi>Midriff,</hi> and that I was very well known to Perſons of all Ranks, and that he could not himſelf be a Stranger to my Reputation in Phyſick; otherwiſe he would not have call'd me, when there were ſo many <hi>learned</hi> Perſons of the ſame Profeſſion to be had every where. What, ſaid he, was it you that ſent me the Doſe of Poiſon the other Day? I told him, I had only been call'd the ſame Morning, but as yet had order'd nothing for him. By this Time the Servant came into the Room, who had been to fetch me, and went to confirm what I had ſaid; but he was in ſo dreadful a Condition, that he could neither bear any one to be in his Preſence, neither durſt he be by himſelf; he ſnatch'd up the Stand again, and before I could do any Thing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, he hit the Servant with it; for he was grown jealous of all Perſons that were about him, and believ'd they had enter'd into a Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. When they were all gone, he looked ſtedfaſtly upon me; but being afraid to offer me any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0544800100:40"/>Violence, and equally dreading to truſt himſelf in my Company alone; he therefore fled out of the Room with a great deal of Precipitation, and ſhut himſelf up in another.</p>
            <p>By all theſe Signs, I found Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, Diſtemper border'd upon Lunacy, and that there was no ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, his Imaginations were ſo wholly fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſappointments; tho' he could not really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect within himſelf, at that Time, what they were, or how they had happen'd: He thought himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd and undone, but by whom, or in what Manner, it was impoſſible for him now to conceive, ſo great was his Diſturbance: Nor is it altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but he might have a Conſcience and Dread of his having injur'd others, who were ready to take their Revenge: And tho' this may not be real, yet ſuch Impreſſions are often made or the Minds of lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Perſons, merely from the common Fame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which, at laſt, ſettles into a firm Belief; and it, no doubt, proceeded from ſuch extravagant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that he look'd upon all Perſons, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, to be his Enemies.</p>
            <p>When I came down Stairs, I found ſeveral of his Stewards not a little dejected at the Misfortunes which had happen'd to their Maſter. One of them had been my Acquaintance many Years; and as I was willing to leave ſome Directions, I made towards him, and told him all that had happen'd to Sir <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and at the ſame time I deſir'd ſome Care might be taken of him; that he ſhould be immediately bled, to the Quantity of Ten Ounces, and that afterwards they ſhould not ſuffer him to be by himſelf a Minute; for it might be hazardous, eſpecially, if there were either Knives or Garters in the way. I told him likewiſe, how dangerous this Seaſon was above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Times of the Year; but that as the Weather was become more ſerene, he might probably grow better. But my Friend was very much ſtartled at
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0544800100:41"/>theſe Sayings; for he could not imagine how a Man of ſo much Senſe could be in ſuch a Condition: What, ſays he, do yon look upon Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> to be mad? I anſwer'd, Not directly mad, tho' at the ſame Time, I could not judge his Caſe to be much different from that of a Lunatick at preſent. To this my Friend reply'd, That it was impoſſible, for he had for many Years been accounted a very long-headed Man, and had been able to go through Buſineſs that no Man could manage but himſelf, and that the ableſt Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had always commended his Abilities. I ſaid, that was not at all to be doubted of; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of Stateſmen were ſeldom wanting to thoſe who could ſerve a preſent Turn, tho' the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf might neither be difficult, nor yet well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed in all Points: But that, I told him, was not very much to the purpoſe; for ſuppoſing him to be a Man of never ſo great Dexterity in Buſineſs, it could be no Argument why he ſhould not be liable to the ſame Maladies as other Men. Then my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ask'd me, What I meant by taking care that there ſhould be no Knives or Garters in the way? Do you believe, ſaid he, that he is ſo melancholy as to make away with himſelf? All the Anſwer I made to this was, That People could never be too much upon their Guard, with reſpect to any one in ſuch Circumſtances: Upon this he left me with all the Haſte imaginable to faſten the Windows; for the Thought came luckily into his Head, that unleſs they were ſo ſecur'd as Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> could not open 'em, he might, perhaps, leap out and break his Neck.</p>
            <p>The Day following, I made him another Viſit, and found him much alter'd for the better, after a Vein had been open'd. I was told he became excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thirſty, and drank above a Quart of white Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, at ſeveral Times, mix'd with Water, which dos'd him to ſuch a Degree, that at laſt he fell into a ſound Sleep, which continued for the Space of nine
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0544800100:42"/>Hours. This had carried off the <hi>Delirium,</hi> ſo that he was now become pretty ſenſible; and as ſoon as I came into the Room, he began to make an Apology for his rude Treatment of me the Day before, which had been told him by the People that were about him. He ſaid he had been in a very ſtrange Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it was ſo much like a confus'd Dream, that he could hardly remember any thing of it, excepting only, that he imagin'd there were a great many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gather'd about the Houſe to kill him, moſt of whom were Perſons of Diſtinction, and ſome, as he thought, were no leſs than Knights of the Garter; and moreover he believ'd firmly, that his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were in League with them, and had engag'd to deliver him up. I obſerv'd to him, that ſuch Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations were very uſual to Perſons in his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and that it was a Sign his Mind had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſhaken, but that he muſt endeavour to learn a little more Fortitude, this being a Juncture which required him to exert all the noble Qualities he was Maſter of. At this he made me a Bow with his Head, and, with an obliging Air, he alſo thank'd me for the good Opinion I had of him. I was a little ſurpriz'd at firſt what his Meaning was, and began to fear a Relapſe; but I ſoon found he was only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Miſtake, and had apply'd the Epithet <hi>Noble</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than I intended it. But as I never love to flatter my Patients to their own Prejudice, I ventur'd to put him in the right in this Particular. I obſerv'd, that we had all of us noble Qualities implanted in us by Nature, tho' the far greater Number employ'd them to diſhonourable and ignoble Purpoſes; and I doubt not, but a Perſon, ſuch as he was, who had gone thro' ſo many different Scenes of Liſe, and had been ſo much converſant among Men, muſt be very ſenſible of this in the Practice of the World. And I was going to obſerve how uſeful and noble a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity Fortitude was, and what Virtues were required
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0544800100:43"/>in us before we could arrive to any tolerable degree of it; but he interrupted me, and ſaid, thoſe Things were indeed very fine to talk of; tho', as to his own Part, he never troubled himſelf with Mens good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Qualities, any further than to take care they ſhould not hurt him with them if poſſible. Then he ask'd me if I could order him any Thing that could do him good, for he found himſelf mighty ſubject to a Trembling, and was apt to ſtart and be ſurpriz'd at every Thing. I told him, all that Phyſick could do in that Caſe ſignified but little, for his Diſtemper was really more in his Mind than Body; that his Body indeed ſuffered, but that was only ſecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if his Mind could be brought into a right Compoſure, the other would ſoon be freed from its preſent Indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Tho' he all this while had anſwer'd as rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as was uſual to him at other Times, yet I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a very great Diſturbance in his Looks by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and he was ready, upon every ſlight occaſion, to fall into unreaſonable Paſſions with his Servants; whereupon I advis'd him not to ſuffer every little Offence to diſcompoſe him, for that would be the ready means to aggravate his Diſorders, whereas a contrary Habit would help greatly to leſſen them. But while I was expoſtulating with him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we were ſuddenly alarm'd with a Noiſe in the Street, which brought him into a freſh <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium;</hi> it was nothing but the Mob was gathered about a Pick-Pocket, whom the Officers were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a Magiſtrate; but when Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> heard their Tongues very loud, as is uſual upon ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, he ſtar'd and began to look exceeding wild, and all of a ſudden leaping from his Chair, he went to hide himſelf. It was with much difficulty we could beat this new Prepoſſeſſion out of his Head, becauſe the Impreſſions were made very deep but the Day before. He believ'd his Adverſaries had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0544800100:44"/>now laid cloſe Siege to the Houſe, and he often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out with a bellowing Voice to ſee that all the Doors were ſecured; but when he found there was nothing real in all this, he ſeated himſelf again in his Chair, and turn'd very dumpiſh, which is the uſual Reſult of Fear, Anger and Deſpair, which, as has been obſerv'd, ordinarily bear the aſcendant in all ſuch melancholy Diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>After this, I call'd upon him ſeveral Days ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and preſcrib'd what I judg'd proper by way of Phyſick; but I was more particularly ſolicitous in what concern'd his Diet, and as he was a Man of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what plethorick Habit of Body, and lately become more than ordinarily addicted to Paſſion, I look'd upon Abſtemiouſneſs to be the likelieſt Means to bring that under, and therefore I order'd him ſuch Food as was of eaſy Digeſtion, and at the ſame time afforded but moderate Nouriſhment: This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was attended with ſo much Succeſs, that he mended ſo far as to go abroad, for his Affairs were urgent, and very much required his Preſence.</p>
            <p>But it is next to an Impoſſibility to effectuate a perfect Cure on any one in Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Circumſtances, for he is really but a Man of a weak Mind and little Knowledge. He had indeed, like many other ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Perſons, gain'd a very great Reputation among Men, yet that was only taken from outward Shew and Appearance, and not from any Virtue or Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein he had excelled others; but as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in conſtant Employment, his Mind was wholly taken off from many of thoſe leſſer Concerns which the more numerous part of Mankind are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten engag'd in. This had created a Severity in his Looks, which was accompanied with an Air and Semblance of Wiſdom, ſufficient to impoſe on all who had not a perfect Intimacy and Acquaintance with him. But it appears, now the Mask is taken off, that he is no other than a meer Pedant in Buſineſs,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0544800100:45"/>and one who, like the blind Horſe in a Mill, went as ſure and as ſteady as the moſt quick ſighted could have done, ſo long as he kept plodding and drudging in his uſual Round of Affairs; for then all was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of his Underſtanding. But when Pride, Avarice, and Ambition (the conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of our firſt-rate Fools) had once carried him beyond that Circle, he was ſoon bewilder'd in a Maze of Difficulties, while his perplex'd Mind was no ways ſeaſon'd with thoſe Virtues that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to extricate and ſet him at Liberty.</p>
            <p>The laſt Time I went to him, I found his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill altered, tho' I cannot ſay it was a great deal for the better. He was not indeed ſo much afraid of Aſſaſſinations and Conſpiracies as he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and I perceiv'd he was not ſo eaſily alarumd at Noiſes in the Street; but I found a new Calamity had taken hold of him, and tho' it did not ſeem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to point at his Life, yet it touch'd that which was as dear to him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Money and his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He told me he was grown worſe and worſe, and that he hop'd ſome People would be quiet when they had made an end of him. Upon this I went to feel his Pulſe, for he had a pretty high Colour in his Face, which made me believe he was feveriſh, or elſe that he had been drinking. When I was coming towards him, he ſtarted, looked me broad in the Face, and ask'd me haſtily, what I was going to do. I told him I intended nothing that would hurt him, and with that I took hold of his Wriſt. I found him a little feveriſh, which I judge might be occaſion'd by the great diſturbance of his Thoughts, which had kept him from Sleep. After which, I ask'd him who thoſe were he was now ſo much afraid of? He anſwered, they were Perſons of ſome Note, whom he had once in his Life-time obliged very much, but he found they had neither Honour nor Gratitude in them. They envy'd the little Acquiſitions he had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0544800100:46"/>made, and could never be ſatisfied, unleſs a Man wou'd give up all he had ever toil'd and labour'd for. He ſaid they had ſuborn'd falſe Witneſs to ſwear againſt him, that he had us'd many ill Practices, and been a bad Example to others; and that they might put him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s great Expence, and bring him under as much Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and Diſgrace as poſſible, they would oblige him to build a Scaffold in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> for his own Tryal. Well, anſwer'd I, what have you further to ſay? To ſay, reply'd Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> a great deal. Thoſe very Men and I were exceeding friendly but a little while ago; they complimented me, and I did Favours for them, and many of their Friends too; they often told me what a uſeful Subject I was, and how great a ſhare I had in his Majeſty's Favour; and that they never omitted to ſpeak a good Word for me as often as they had an Opportunity. But now, ſaid he, I know by their Looks they have a mind to ruin me, and ſome of them even uſe oblique Threatnings to my Face. I began by this time to believe that Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> gave Credit to his own Dreams, and indeed I could hardly forbear being out of Humour, to hear him talk at this extravagant Rate. I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to compoſe himſelf, and not ſuffer ſuch idle Fancies to run in his Head, for there was nothing at all in them. In them, ſaid he, don't you hear it talk'd in all Places wherever you come? I was not a Stranger to the Rumours that were ſpread about the Town concerning Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Conduct; but I thought it not proper to make him a direct Anſwer. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to him, that we were all of us liable to Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages as often as we preſum'd raſhly to go out of our limited Bounds. That we were naturally apt to do this, from an over-fond Conceit and Opinion of our own Merits and Abilities. That we long'd to be at thoſe things which were placed at the greateſt diſtance from us, and, like <hi>Icharus,</hi> we often plung'd ourſelves into an Ocean of Troubles, while we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0544800100:47"/>to fly up to the Sun with Wings of our own making. I took notice, that many of us were too forward to fix our Hopes on an imaginary Good, and from a too eager Deſire after it, made uſe of indirect Means to obtain it. This, I ſaid, might undoubtedly be the reaſon why ſuch Perſons, when their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fail them, were commonly toſſed about with the Imagination of Evils, which had their Being no where ſo much as in the Mind. But Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> took all this as apply'd to himſelf, and with a Smile, which at the ſame time carried an Air of Diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Contempt, ask'd me what he had ever aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after that was imaginary. I know, ſaid he, you Philoſophers often account thoſe Things imaginary, that other People find to be real; you reckon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney an imaginary Good, but ſhew me what you or any Man can do without it. Honour and Greatneſs, I know, are alſo claſſed in the ſame Rank, according to your preciſe way of thinking, but let me ſee the Man will refuſe either when offer'd to him. I made anſwer, that there was, no doubt, a real Good in all thoſe Things, when they were put to their right and proper Uſe, and that Peoples Deſires were moderate in them, and their Deſigns truly honourable: And I was going on, to tell him what it was that, in my Judgment, render'd them evil. But he interrupted me, and ſaid, he did not ſee but every Body was for getting all they could, and what Reaſon was there that he ſhould be behind hand, ſince he had perhaps deſerv'd like other Men; but eſpecially the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to that paſs, that thoſe Perſons were only trampled upon, or ſet light by, who were not in ſome Degree of Power or Authority. I could not but own what he had obſerv'd was oftentimes too true, if meant with reſpect to Men in narrow Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and inferior Station. But yet I ſaid that was no Argument, why ſuch as wanted nothing, and were even got above the Inſults of the World, ſhould aſpire
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0544800100:48"/>further, unleſs it was purely, that they might be able to do the more Good. If after this, they were prompted by any other Motives to advance their Station, than what proceeded from a truly publick Spirit, I obſerv'd that they were moſt commonly bad ones. I ſaid, moreover, that no Man could be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, in the Enjoyment of his Acquiſitions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Riches, or from any outward Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction confer'd upon him, without thoſe Requiſites, that bear the true Stamp of Nobility; <hi>viz.</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of noble and virtuous Actions; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that Teſtimony was wanting in an exalted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I ſaid, it was generally attended with a great deal of Uneaſineſs. I concluded, that Titles were, at beſt, eſteem'd but meer Pageantry, when they were not ſupported with true Generoſity; and, whatever a vain Perſon in undeſerved Honours might think of himſelf, he was in the Eyes of all wiſe Men accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no better than a Figure of Wax, robed in Purple, or a prophane Image ſet up to be worſhip'd, tho' it has not the leaſt Shadow or Appearance of a Deity.</p>
            <p>I could not avoid expoſtulating with Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> in this Manner, and likewiſe beſtowing on him ſome grave Admonitions; becauſe I found his Heart whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon Nobility, an Honour whereunto he had no juſt Title, nor indeed any Likelihood of enjoying it. Yet all my Arguments could not avail ſo as to bring him to any Senſe of his Folly; for he was too far gone in that Delirium to brook the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He had, not long ago, ſo ſtrong a Preſumption of being made a Peer; and his Mind was ſo highly tranſported with the Hopes of it, that he had drawn up the Form of a Preamble, ſuch as he, no doubt, flatter'd himſelf would be made on the Entry to his own Patent. This I accidentally obſerv'd to lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen upon his Table, among ſome other Papers; for I was ſo near that I could peruſe ſome part of it; but looking upon it to be no leſs hurtful while in his Sight, than Wine to a Man who is already drunk; I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0544800100:49"/>therefore, as the beſt Office I could do him, waited an Opportunity to deprive him of that Idol; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry luckily, when his Face was turn'd from me, I took it up, and put it in my Pocket unobſerv'd, and have now committed it to the publick, with the ſame marginal Notes that were upon it; becauſe it will give the curious Reader ſome further Inſight into his Condition. It is as follows:</p>
            <p>If a noble and ancient Pedigree has always been accounted a great Advance in the Way to Honour and Nobility, our<note n="*" place="margin">When I come to be a Peer, all publick Writings from the King's Majeſty will run, <hi>To our truſty and well-beloved Couſin and Counſellour.</hi>
               </note> truſty and well-beloved <hi>Anthony Wheel,</hi> Knt. muſt, in that reſpect, be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended to us, as he is a Perſon of no mean or ignoble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, but ſprung from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Race of the <hi>Wheels;</hi> a Family, which tho' it has for many Ages paſt ſtrove with the Iniquities of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, yet, by its frequent Alliances with thoſe of the beſt Blood, derives a no ſmall Honour on all its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Deſcendants.—And if we alſo put a Value on the Goods of Fortune, as theſe are the Means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſons in the higheſt Stations, as well to ſupport their great Dignity, as to render them the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Patrons of their Country, he muſt no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our high Regard on that Account, having by his own proper Merit arriv'd at ſuch large Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as may vie with the greateſt of our Peers; and therefore may well become the Repreſentative of ſuch worthy Anceſtors, whoſe almoſt extinguiſh'd Fame is again happily reviv'd in him; and the<note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0544800100:50"/>long, and paſs'd through the beſt Stages of their Lives in the Service of their native Country, the ſaid Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> muſt undoubtedly claim a juſt Title to thoſe diſtinguiſhing Marks of our Royal Favour, he having not only given us many ſignal Proofs of his uncommon Abilities in divers conſiderable and weighty<note n="*" place="margin">I am afraid I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have this Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unleſs I be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome pretty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Poſt for a little while.</note> Employments, but by his ſtrict Fidelity, aſſiduous Care, and indefatigable Induſtry, render'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt dear unto us, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly eſteem'd by all our good and faithful Subjects. And if thoſe Perſons are highly to be accounted of, who in all Times of Danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come notable Inſtruments in Defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, tho' to the utmoſt Hazard of their Lives; and, if beſides the Glory they thereby purchaſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ought alſo to receive all due Honour from us, as a further Reward of their Valour and noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements; ſo we ought by no means to paſs by unregarded the extraordinary Merit of ſuch of our good and Loyal Subjects, who being Maſters of very large and uncommon Poſſeſſions, are no leſs ready to venture them in a Time of need. This truly publick Spirit has moſt manifeſtly ſhewn it ſelf, in many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ſingular Inſtances of Sir <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Life; but more eſpecially by his hearty Zeal and Readineſs to redeem the Debts of the Nation, having, like a true-hearted <hi>Briton,</hi> ſet a notable and great Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to many others of our wealthy Subjects, by whoſe joint Endeavours, the great Burden, which by a long and neceſſary War lies ſo heavy upon us, is now like to be ſoon leſſened, and our good Subjects eaſed of many ſore and grievous Taxes, which are very oppreſſive upon them.—But if we alſo regard the ſaid Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> with reſpect to many other Qualifications and Endowments, which recommend thoſe who are advanced unto the higheſt Honours, the Portlineſs of his Perſon, and ſtately Behaviour, ought not to be overlooked. We commend ſome for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0544800100:51"/>their Politeneſs, ſome for their Affability, and others for their courtly Deportment. But Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> is a Perſon, whoſe noble and ſtately Carriage beſpeaks the real Greatneſs of his Mind; he knowing full well at all times, how to keep up that Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which is ſo highly becoming an exalted Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For theſe and many other publick and private Virtues, ſo manifeſt in Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> beſides his known Loyalty to our Royal Perſon and Family, (ever ſince our Acceſſion to the Throne) we have thought fit to call him to the Dignity of a Peer of our Realm, by the Name and Title of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lord Wheel</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The ſame Title will anſwer very well to Earl, or Duke; for <hi>Wheelburrow</hi> ſounds like <hi>Marlburrow.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I was told, Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> had alſo intoxicated his Brains with many other Things; ſuch as uſually tickle the Fancies of vain and preſumptuous Perſons, and altho' he was as great a Lover of Money as any Man could well be, yet no one was more laviſh when it tended to the Gratification of his vain and ambitious Deſires; but among many others, I ſhall only name this one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which I had from my old Acquaintance; and that was concerning his Picture, which was to be drawn at full Length, with the Frame all of pure Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finely gilt; for this he had agreed to pay a very extraordinary Sum, but it was put off for a Time, and very probably until he was made a Peer, that he might be painted in his Robes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 22. I was call'd to <hi>Robert Pitfal</hi> Eſq. a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Gentleman, who had faln ſick at an Inn. He was a Man near forty, and of a ſeemingly robuſt Conſtitution, and of a hail Country Complexion, ſo that I could not perceive any great Symptoms of Sickneſs, excepting only, that I found his Pulſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſorderly: I therefore ask'd him very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, how he found himſelf, and what it was he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0544800100:52"/>of moſt. He told me he had got a new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper he never had heard of before; and when I ask'd him what that was, he ſaid, ev'ry Body told him he had got the Hyppo, and that they ſaid, it was a plaguy whimſical Diſeaſe, that made People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and fancy Things, and that he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what it could be; unleſs it was the ſame, that a Parſon had, of a neighbouring Pariſh to that where he liv'd, who us'd to fancy he had a clucking Hen in his Head, and ſet all the Country a laughing at him. Upon this, I told him, that I hop'd he had no ſuch Imaginations as thoſe. Not I, reply'd the Gentleman, but the other Night I could not lie in Bed, but was forced to get up again, and had a Fire made in my Room; and in the Morning, when I told my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady how I had been, ſhe laught at me, and ſaid, I had only got the Hyppo; and if I would keep my own Counſel, no body would know I ail'd any Thing, becauſe I look ſo well. But to tell you freely, ſays he, I believe you are half poiſon'd in this Town with unwholeſome Food; and I am ſure I have eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing my ſelf that cannot digeſt, but lies like a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Lump of Lead in my Stomach, which oftentimes ſwells up in my Throat like to choak me; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I lay my Head down upon the Pillow: And I believe, continued he, there is ſomething in your Drink too, that ſhould not be in it, which makes it more than ordinarily diuretick, for I make a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deal of Water lately. By theſe Expreſſions I found he was indeed touched with the <hi>Hyppo;</hi> and becauſe I obſerv'd him to be one who had been us'd to eat and drink plentifully, and wanted his uſual Exerciſe to digeſt it; and being of a full groſs Habit of Body, and as he complain'd likewiſe of a Swimming and Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in his Head; I was therefore of Opinion, he might be very apt to fall into a Fit or the Apoplexy; to prevent which, I order'd him to be let Blood in the ſir<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Place, and after that to be vomited; I order'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0544800100:53"/>him likewiſe ſome Cephalicks. But when I had got Pen, Ink and Paper, and was juſt going to write, he call'd out with a great deal of vehemence to prevent me, and ſwore heartily, he would have no more Bills and Notes, for he had lately parted with above the half of his Eſtate, and had got nothing but Paper for it. But when I told him I was only going to give ſome Directions to the Apothecary, that he might make up what was proper for his Diſtemper, he ask'd my Pardon, and ſaid he hop'd I would not take it amiſs; for the very Sight of Scraps of Paper put him almoſt out of his Senſes. By this, I alſo came to know what had been the Cauſe of his Diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had, like the reſt of my Patients, been pretty deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Stocks, and that Things had not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there to his Wiſhes. When I was going, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he might be carefull to mind my Directions, which the Apothecary would acquaint him with, and that I doubted not, but I ſhou'd find him better in a ſhort Time.</p>
            <p>When I came the next Day, he look'd ſomewhat out of Humour, and before I could ask him any Queſtions, he began to complain, ſaying, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt kill'd him with the Vomit, that it had made him as ſick as a Horſe, and that he had never been in ſuch a Condition ſince he was born, excepting once after a fit of hard drinking with ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at a Horſe-race, where they drunk little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a very ſtrong kind of Punch, which was made with Brandy and Whitewine without Water. By this I find, that Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> had never been much us'd to Phyſick, for he alſo ask'd me what was the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I had ſent him, and whether I had not put <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burrow</hi> Water in it, for he ſaid it taſted like Mares Piſs. I anſwered, that there were ſome Volatile Salts in it, which had not indeed a Taſte that ſuited every ones Palate; but at the ſame time I obſerved to him, that theſe were very proper to remove that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0544800100:54"/>Diſorder of his Head he had ſo much complain'd of, and that they would certainly be of Service to him, provided he would be ſo far his own Friend as to continue in the Uſe of them. To this he reply'd, that he believ'd they had done him ſome good already, for he had ſlept better that Night than he had done for a Week before, and he thought his Head was not altogether ſo cloudy as it had been, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſaid he ſhould very willingly take the Stuff in the Bottle, or any thing elſe I thought proper for him, if it would not ſet him a vomiting again. I told him I could not well avoid ordering him a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the Beginning, as it was neceſſary to lay the Foundation of his Cure, but that I hop'd there would be no occaſion to repeat it. After this, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him to go abroad and divert himſelf, and as he had Horſes at command, and had always been us'd to Riding and Country Exerciſe, I ſaid it wou'd be of no ſmall Service to him if he rid out once a Day into the open Air, eſpecially, ſince he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up his Lodgings in ſo cloſe a Place, and where there was ſo much Dung and Litter. But he made anſwer, that he lik'd the Smell of Horſe-dung better than ſome of our fineſt Gardens about <hi>London,</hi> and that he believ'd it would do him no Hurt, for he had heard ſeveral learned Men ſay, that nothing was more wholeſome than the Smell of a Muck-hill. He ſaid he had lain one Night at Sir <hi>Thomas Courtley</hi>'s, who, he told me, was his firſt Couſin, but could not reſt for the Noiſe of People thumping at the Doors, and calling out continually in the Street; And beſides, he obſerv'd, that altho' Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was indeed very civil, yet he did not much like to be at his Houſe, for he found he was always out of Humour when any Body wanted him, and us'd to chide his Servants for ſaying he was at Home. He ſaid, that a Man had as good be continually at Church as at Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s, for no Body in the Houſe ſpoke but as if they were whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0544800100:55"/>ſomething that ſhould not be heard; and when they were at Table, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> directed moſt of his Diſcourſe to ſome body elſe, which oblig'd him to ſit as ſilent as a Stock. He added likewiſe, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> commonly went away as ſoon as Dinner was over, when it was the proper time to drink a Glaſs and ſmoak a Pipe; that he us'd to take his Leave very civilly, and deſired him to ſtay and divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Wife and Daughters, who never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him with any thing but Tea, and that the young Huſſeys us'd to fill him brimmers, which he believ'd was only that he might ſcald his Fingers, on purpoſe to laugh at him when he was gone; and for theſe Reaſons he lov'd to be at an Inn, where he paid for what he had, and could therefore uſe his Freedom: Beſides, that he always lik'd to be near his Horſes, for he ſaid the People in this Town were not to be truſted. I could not indeed forbear giving my Aſſent to what Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> had ſaid, becauſe I found Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and he was of a quite different Turn and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, for an Inn is no doubt better than a Palace, where a Man is under any Reſtraint and Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>After two Days I made him another Viſit, it was Night before I came, and I found him much more chearful than thoſe times I had ſeen him before; but he was engag'd with a Countryman of his own, who it ſeems had been drinking <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Ale with him moſt part of the Afternoon: I told him I was glad to ſee him look ſo brisk, and that I hop'd he found himſelf better. I have been much the better, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd he, for my honeſt Neighbour's Company, whoſe coming to Town has perfectly reviv'd me; he lives but within three Miles of my Houſe, and he is a Man that, beſides ſome Eſtate of his own, rents a very good Farm of a neighbouring Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and I believe were you to go to his Houſe, you would ſay you never met with a more hearty Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0544800100:56"/>and I'll ſay that for him, he always keeps a Glaſs of as good Ale as any Man in the County. Ay, thank God, ſays the Countryman, I am never without a Tub of Liquor, tho' it is not ſo good as the Squire's, yet ſuch homely Fare as we have, this, or any other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentleman ſhould be welcome to, were they to come our Way. With that the Countryman ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me if I were Eſq; <hi>Pitfal</hi>'s Doctor. When I had ſatisfied him in that Queſtion, the Countryman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I thought ſo by what you ſaid when you came firſt in, and I was juſt telling him of a Cure Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> in our Country advis'd my Wife to, for ſhe was much troubled with Wind, as the Eſq; is; and that was to ſwallow three Grains of white Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per whole every Night when ſhe went to Bed, and this cur'd her that ſhe has never been troubled with Wind ſince, more than any other Woman ſhould be; and I believe, ſaid he, would but the Eſq; take that Cure, it would do him as much good as any thing. I told him black Pepper would do every bit as well as white. Ay but, ſaid the Countryman, Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> made my Wife take white Pepper, and it was that cur'd her; and I well remember it, Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> once cur'd me of a great Surfeit which came by a Cold I catch'd when our Waters were up one <hi>Allhallontide.</hi> I came Home miſerable bad, for my Mare had ſwum with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half a Mile in the <hi>Burch-lane,</hi> and when the Dr. brought me the Phyſick, I ſaid I was ſure ſuch a ſmall thing as it would do nothing at me, for it was no bigger than a grey Pea; but I my Troth I ſhall never forget it, for it purg'd me upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at leaſt twelve or fourteen times, and I was as well in two or three Days as ever I was in all my Life. After this, the Countryman went on in praiſe of Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> and was ſeconded by Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> in all he ſpoke; he ſaid he was a very ingenious Man, and the ſtrangeſt Fellow in the World for finding out Peoples Diſeaſes, and for curing them ſoon, for he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0544800100:57"/>always ſtruck at the Cauſe; and as for broken Bones, he ſaid he would venture to let him looſe with any Man in <hi>England.</hi> I made anſwer, that Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> might be a very knowing Perſon for any thing I could ſay to the contrary; but at the ſame time I obſerv'd that Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> could ſuſtain no great Loſs for the want of him while in <hi>London,</hi> where there were ſo many able Profeſſors. There is no doubt of that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Countryman, for you have all the Learning here, and all the Money too. But I wiſh Eſq; <hi>Pitfal</hi> very well, and the whole Family; I was one of the Stewards to the old Eſq; his Father that Year he was made High-Sheriff of our County, and Mr. <hi>Robert</hi> was then but a Stripling; I believe he remembers it well enough, for we had as topping Doings then, as ever was known ſince in our Parts.</p>
            <p>We frequently meet with Men in all Counties, who, beſides an uncommon Dexterity in Country Affairs by their unwearied Diligence and Application, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Maſters of many of thoſe frugal Maxims of Life which are the beſt ſuited to Perſons in a Rural Station, by which means they alſo get the ſtart of many of their Neighbours. This brings them into the Notice of ſeveral of the Country Gentlemen, while others, who were once upon a Level with them, are neglected, and the Familiarity to which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, creates in them ſuch a Boldneſs and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they never fail, upon all Occaſions, to give in their Verdict, tho' in things which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of their Depth; and altho' what they ſay is oftentimes neither very ſeaſonable, nor much to the purpoſe, yet all this paſſes for the moſt part without Reprehenſion, as the better ſort are ever willing to make ſufficient Allowance, while the reſt are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways competent Judges. I ſoon obſerv'd Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi>'s Country Neighbour to be one of this Stamp. He knows full well, as he imagines, how to exert his Native Property, and values himſelf much upon it;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0544800100:58"/>and as he ſeems to be a Man perfectly eaſy in his Circumſtances, he ſpares not thoſe who keep him at his due diſtance, but will be often very tart in his Expreſſions againſt them, tho' no one is more neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly, and, as far as is agreeable to his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Manner of Life, ſubmiſſive to ſuch of his Superiors as admit him into any degree of Familiarity with them. This makes him have a more than ordinary regard for Mr. <hi>Pitfal,</hi> who is a plain honeſt Country Gentleman, and lives with him no otherwiſe than as a good ſociable Neighbour. When I had thus diſcovered what kind of Perſon the Countryman was, and that there was a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect between Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> and him, I parted with an Air of Complacency, telling him that nothing ſhould be wanting that might tend to the Gentleman's ſpeedy Recovery.</p>
            <p>The next Time I call'd, which was alſo towards Evening, I found him engag'd, as before, with his Country Neighbour, and a grave elderly Clergyman, who I underſtood was his Relation; but his Caſe ſeem'd to be ſomewhat worſe, and notwithſtanding he had been drinking, his Spirits were very low, and he was in a great deal of Deſpair of his Life; and there was truly a no ſmall Concern perceivable in his Looks. When I ask'd him how he did, the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſeem'd alſo to be in a great deal of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhook his Head, and, without giving Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> time to anſwer, ſaid, he believ'd the Eſq; would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly get over this, for he was afraid it had ſeiz'd his Brain, and that he look'd juſt as the old Eſq; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the laſt time he ſaw him, which was abour a Week before he dy'd. Upon this I told the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman he was one of <hi>Job</hi>'s Comforters, for there was no Danger of dying, unleſs Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> ſhould give himſelf wholly up to Sorrow and Diſcontent. I took Notice that Fear was a natural Ingredient in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and that it never fail'd to produce ſuch Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0544800100:59"/>as were now obſervable in Mr. <hi>Pitfal,</hi> and therefore that it behov'd every one, who kept him Company, to fortify him as much againſt it as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But when I began to examine more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Matter, I found he had been tolerably well, until ſuch time as his Couſin the Clergyman came in, who ſtruck a ſudden Damp upon his Mind, by telling him that the Stocks had fallen that Day above 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and therefore as ſoon as I came to learn this, I made uſe of ſeveral Arguments to give a turn to his melancholy Thoughts, and to chear his Spirits, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that the Price of all ſuch things were preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; that they were up one Day, and down ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in time they might perhaps riſe as high as ever, and let the worſt come, they would hardly ſink ſo low as ſome People imagin'd. I obſerv'd that the Care of his Health ought to take place of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temporal Intereſts, as that was agreeable to the principal Law of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Self-preſervation; and, I ſaid any one would undoubtedly be thought a Madman, who ſhould love his Money, or any other of his Goods ſo well, as to hurry himſelf out of the World for the ſake of them. Upon this, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman alſo made uſe of ſeveral grave Arguments, telling him, that a Man's Life conſiſts not in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the Things which he poſſeſſeth, and that a ſmall matter, rightly managed, would eaſily ſupport each individual in all that is abſolutely neceſſary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Life or rational Pleaſure. And I found he was alſo going to put him in Mind wherein to place his true Happineſs; but the Countryman, who I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd had been drinking, and was now ſomewhat fluſter'd, broke in upon him, and interrupted him. By the Maſs, ſays he, if that be all troubles the Eſq; I think he's to blame; for when he has ſold as much as will pay that new Mortgage, he'll have Five hundred a Year ſtill, to my Knowledge, and if he cannot live upon that, believe me, a Lord's Rent would be little
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0544800100:60"/>enough for him. But while he was going on to take a Survey of all the Manors and Farms belonging to Mr. <hi>Pitfal,</hi> he ſtop'd him, ſaying, Thou knoweſt very well, <hi>Thomas,</hi> when my Father dy'd, there was ſome Burden upon my Eſtate, which I was forc'd to clear; Thou knoweſt likewiſe, that I am forc'd to pay four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Pounds a Year to my Brother <hi>Marle,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ray Siſter <hi>Betty,</hi> as the Intereſt of her Fortune, and the Principal muſt be paid when he wants it; and I have a Wife and four Children at Home, beſides my Mother's threeſcore Pounds a Year. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the good old Lady, cry'd <hi>Thomas,</hi> you'll never have the leſs for her, ſhe has been a good Woman in her time as I believe was in all our Country. But Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> went on and took notice, that his Houſe was grown very old and chargeable in Repairs, and if he had ſucceeded as he thought once to have done, he intended to have built a new one. I hope, ſays <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> you'll take care how you ſend your Money to the <hi>South-Sea</hi> again, but keep it on the dry Land for the time to come, and with the Grace of God, you may do well enough ſtill, as we live in a Country where all Things are both cheap and plentiful. I ſeconded what <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſaid, and told Mr. <hi>Pitfal,</hi> that a continued Courſe of frugal Management in his Affairs at Home would be a means as likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve his paſt Loſſes, as could be expected any other way; and tho' the Gain might not be ſo ſudden, yet it would be very certain, as there was ſtill a Foundation for it; beſides, that a continual Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would give a good reliſh to his Life, and maintain a conſtant Series of Health, as that, would never fail to refreſh the Mind at all times, and keep up a perfect Sun-ſhine and Cheerfulneſs, by the Succeſſion of one eaſy and uſeful Project after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that he might perhaps, at laſt, find as much Pleaſure and real Satisfaction in a gradual retrieving of his Fortune, as if it had been all at once by thoſe new Methods he had propos'd to himſelf. I obſerv'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0544800100:61"/>that the Mind of Man was, according to its preſent State of Exiſtence, incapable of very high or ſudden Enjoyments, and that thoſe Perſons, who had the weakeſt Minds, and the leaſt Ability, had common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt powerful Incentives to prompt them ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to ſomething they propos'd, as an Ultimate of their Wiſhes, and that it often far'd with them in the End, as with the fond young Man, who was ſo much in Love with his own Image in the Water, that he drown'd himſelf in endeavouring to come at it. I warrant you, ſaid <hi>Thomas,</hi> that was before Looking-Glaſſes were in Faſhion. But I went on, and obſerv'd, that it was always an Argument of a great Mind to anticipate Diſappointments, by laying a juſt weight on things, and thereby moderating its Deſires; and that it was a no leſs Token of a noble and brave Soul to fight manfully, and boldly encounter Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they come; but at the ſame time I told Mr. <hi>Pitfal,</hi> that I did not apply what I had been ſaying, in all its Circumſtances, to him, for ſo far as I had learned into his Affairs, I could diſcover nothing he had aim'd at, but what was very reaſonable, and what any other Man in the ſame Condition would have done as well as he, and that I had only taken the Freedom to uſe thoſe Arguments, becauſe I would not have his Misfortunes prey upon him ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his Health. Upon this, he aſſur'd me he aim'd at nothing but to clear his Eſtate, and that he had never gone that way to work, but that ſeveral neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Gentlemen had been in before him, and his Couſin Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſent him two Letters about it. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> — ſaid the Countryman: Ay, marry, that's a fine ſpun Gentleman indeed, and his fine <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Lady; when he was down at the Hall laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was three Years, he ſaid he wondred how Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen could drink Ale as they did; and my Lady, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, would not eat ripe Plumbs that came out of one of our Wench's Hands, for fear they were not clean, but gave them to her Woman.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0544800100:62"/>
            <p>But all this while, Mr. <hi>Pitfal's</hi> Mind run very much upon his Loſſes. He ask'd me if I could give any Account of the Nature of the <hi>South Sea,</hi> and what was intended by it. I was not much ſurpriz'd at this Queſtion, tho' it might no doubt ſeem very odd from any one who was engag'd in it; yet his Caſe was the ſame with many others, who had only in a blindfold Manner followed their Leaders; and it was no Wonder, that a plain country Gentleman ſhould be thus ignorant, when ſo many Perſons about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were ſo little acquainted with it, and ſome of thoſe, Men of Buſineſs too. I told him, that to dive into the Nature of that vaſt Undertaking, ſo as to give any tolerable Inſight into it, either with reſpect to the Advantages of it, or the manifold Hazards that might be in it, would in my Opinion require more Time and Study, than perhaps every one is aware of. But I ſaid, he could not be ignorant of what was intended by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Payment of the national Debts; and that in order thereunto, the <hi>South Sea</hi> Company had agreed with the Government to take in moſt of thoſe Debts and Revenues into their capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Stock, and had engaged not only to allow every Proprietor ſuch Dividends as would in a few Years pay him his Principal, but his full Intereſt, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to what had been granted by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a longer Term of Years; and beſides that, entitle him alſo to a remaining Capital, which would be very conſiderable. I obſerv'd, that this Propoſal had ſo good an Aſpect both to the Government, as it would eaſe the Nation of ſo heavy a Burden of Debt; and to all the Proprietors, who would be ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Gainers by it, that all Perſons, who either had Money at command, or could raiſe it, tho' at never ſo great a Diſcount, ſtrove to become Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in it; and ſure, ſaid I, the Nation was never known in any Age ſo well diſpoſed, and ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the good of Poſterity, as they have been in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0544800100:63"/>this Affair; many Perſons of conſiderable Rank hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid by their State, and condeſcended to mingle with the Crowd, to give the greater Countenance and Encouragement to it. But at this the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man took me up very ſmartly: Pray, Sir, ſaid he, what was the Occaſion of all this great Humility in thoſe Perſons? do you believe it was from a publick Zeal, or from a View to their own private Intereſt, that Men of Quality expoſed themſelves among Crowds of People, and even among the Mob, who at other times would not go one Step to do the leaſt Kindneſs to a poor indigent Perſon? I made Anſwer, that it was not to be doubted, but among ſo great a Number, there might be ſome who had chiefly their own Intereſt in View; but yet, we ought to believe, there were alſo many, whoſe Views were more extenſive and noble; and who had the good of others, and the Benefit of Poſterity moſt at Heat; and I obſerv'd, that this Nation was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at any Time without a Number of brave Spirits, if not ſuperiour, at leaſt equal to thoſe of any other Country round about us, and that it was to be hop'd the Nation was not now ſunk beneath what it had been in all former Ages. But the Clergyman, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Function, judg'd according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule; I found he was a very great Enemy to all thoſe who ſought after Riches, and produced ſeveral Texts, particularly againſt ſuch as haſted to be rich. He alſo us'd many Arguments in behalf of a true and laudable Induſtry, and diſtinguiſhed between that kind of Diligence, which is guided by Virtue, and that which was conducted by Avarice and other vicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; after which he ask'd me what Motive could prompt thoſe Perſons, who were already remarkable for their vaſt Poſſeſſions, to toil and ſtruggle, and to watch every Opportunity of buying and ſelling to the greateſt Advantage, as if they were the pooreſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon Earth, toiling and labouring for Bread.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0544800100:64"/>I made Anſwer, that I could not indeed commend that Practice; but I ſaid, every Man was willing to keep his Ground, and thoſe who had moſt, and had always bore the Aſcendant over others, were inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do ſo ſtill; and that I believ'd ſome of thoſe Perſons might be urg'd on, from a Suſpicion and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, leſt ſuch, as had been all along inferior to them, ſhould at this Juncture riſe up to the ſame Pitch with themſelves; and others, who had been conſtantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a level with them, might now alſo get above them. But the Clergyman inſiſted that theſe were Motives neither honourable, nor any ways juſtifiable; and if there was to be uſed any other more favourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in the behalf of ſuch Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> the Support of the publick Credit, he ſaid, it was the direct Way to deſtroy it; he took notice that it was the Means to raiſe it, and give it a Name, but it was only a Monſter like the Shadow magnify'd on the Wall by the Light of a Candle, which was no ways propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to its Object.</p>
            <p>He was at the ſame time going back to make Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for thoſe who were Men of Quality by Birth, but of inconſiderable Fortune, and likewiſe for ſuch as had been raiſed into ſome Station in the World, and had not wherewithal to ſupport it, when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman broke in upon our Diſcourſe again. He had been all this while leaning forwards, with both his Hands upon the Head of his Stick, and his Face turn'd backwards to us: In this Poſture he had been liſtening very attentively to what we were upon, but being unable to keep ſilent any longer, he graſped me haſtily by the Arm, and ſtretching out his Neck to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, till his Mouth approached dole to mine, ſaid he, what in the Name of Mercy do you think they would do with all that Riches and thoſe great Eſtates if they had them? I was ſenſible <hi>Thomas</hi> would not be eaſily put off without an Anſwer to his Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I therefore obſerv'd, that the greater a Man's
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0544800100:65"/>Poſſeſſions were, he had, no doubt, the more Power put into his Hands of doing Good, and as thoſe Perſons, we had been taking notice of, were ſuppoſed to be Men of high and noble Pedigree, and as it might be expected they were virtuous and honourable, and had likewiſe great and excellent Examples from their own worthy Anceſtors; it Was therefore to be hoped they would do nothing that might bring a Stain upon their Families, to ſully that Luſtre which had been ſo conſpicuous in many of their Progenitors; but if they deſired a further Augmentation of their Subſtances, it was only that they might be able to outſhine others in Acts of true Generoſity. I told him there were Ways enough to beſtow the greateſt Superfluities any Man could be Maſter of; and I ſaid, it was to be preſum'd, if thoſe Perſons had doubled their Eſtates, as they were once in a fair way to do, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would have, no doubt, doubled their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence alſo, and done much greater Services, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Country in general, and to all uſeful Communities of Men, but alſo to particular Perſons. I took notice, it would be then in their Power in a more eminent Manner to ſupport Virtue and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence wherever it was under Oppreſſion, to raiſe up Perſons of diſtinguiſhed Merit, and to depreſs thoſe, who by their Pride and Inſolence were troubleſome to their Neighbours. Ay, marry, ſaid <hi>Thomas;</hi> but when will they do all thoſe fine Things you ſpeak of? and with a grinning Laugh, he ask'd if they would build any new Churches. I could not my ſelf forbear ſmiling at this Queſtion; but to ſatisfy <hi>Thomas,</hi> I made Anſwer, that they would, no doubt, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things aſſiſt in all ſuch pious Works as theſe. But <hi>Thomas,</hi> as is uſual to ſuch Perſons, judg'd of all Men from the few Inſtances himſelf was acquainted with. Believe me, ſaid he, if they be all like our Sir <hi>John,</hi> the Parſons may preach in Barns like the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians. There is a Man knows, pointing to Mr.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0544800100:66"/>
               <hi>Pitfal,</hi> that our Church has been out of Repair theſe twenty Years at leaſt, and now it is in ſo great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling, that on a windy Day, I believe verily there are ſometimes not above ſix Men and Women in it beſides the Parſon, and there are above forty Head in our Pariſh, who will not venture into it at all, but go to the neighbouring Pariſhes about. All our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the Neighbourhood, and the whole Pariſh, have been upon Sir <hi>John</hi> about it, to get us a Brief, becauſe he comes ſo much to <hi>London</hi> among great Men. He has promis'd many time as fair as any Man can do, and ſaid, he would give a hundred Pound towards it himſelf; but we cannot ſee a Penny of his Money, nor the Brief neither, to this Day; but if he was not much bely'd, they ſay he is able to build twenty Churches himſelf with the Money he has got out of the <hi>South Sea</hi> lately, and I am ſure he was rearing a Dog Kennel when I left home, tho' he comes but ſeldom to hunt among us, that will be half as good as any Church we have near us. And as for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up poor Men, as you was talking, he is ſo far from doing that, that ſince he is grown ſo rich, he'll turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any Servant that will ſuffer a poor Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to come about the Houſe. But, ſaid I, you know, <hi>Thomas,</hi> the old Proverb, <hi>One Swallow makes not a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> perhaps all your great Men are not like Sir <hi>John.</hi> Ay, marry, anſwer'd <hi>Thomas,</hi> there is Eſq; <hi>Bramble</hi> in the next Pariſh to ours came down in the beginning of Harveſt in a fine Coach, and ſix tearing Horſes in it; when he went up about ſix Years ago, I think it may be thereabouts, as near as I can remember, his Eſtate was not counted to be better than Eſq; <hi>Pitfal</hi>'s, and ſome ſay it was not ſo good; but believe me, we thought he had a mind to buy the whole County when he came down this laſt Time, for he bid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for every Body's Eſtate, and among the reſt, would have fain had my bit of Land, and offer'd me a very topping Price for it, I'll aſſure you. But I thank
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0544800100:67"/>God I had no occaſion to part with the little I had; but he was at me every Day about it, and ſent for me to his Houſe, and was ſo kind as never was known; he ſaid his Steward ſhould put my Money in the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> where in two or three Months time it might be worth 500 <hi>l.</hi> a Year. You'll ſay that was a pretty thing enough, but his Steward was a Stranger among us, and never truſt me, but I think now it's as well where it is. But all this while, ſaid I, Mr. <hi>Bramble</hi> may be a very good Man, and perhaps may do great Kindneſſes to your Country, as he is now become ſo rich. Ay, anſwer'd <hi>Thomas,</hi> if he end as he has begun, I doubt we ſhall have ſuch doings as has not been known in our Parts. He brought down a parcel of fine dancing Fellows with white Gloves. People ſaid they were his Footmen; but by Lady, I think they were more like Gentlemen, and turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way moſt of his old Servants, except one or two that his Lady would have him keep. Some of them had liv'd there in the old Eſq; his Father's time, and I dare ſay there was none of them would have wrong'd him of a Hair's breadth; but he ſaid it was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to ſee ſuch Fellows about a Gentleman's Houſe; he warn'd away two of the oldeſt Tenants on his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate too, whoſe Leaſes were almoſt up, to make way for a Friend of his new Steward's, who they ſay is to rent both Farms. I cannot tell how all things will end, but I hear he is for being off his Bargain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in moſt of the Eſtates he has bought about us. I ſaid indeed, theſe were Inſtances enough of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men departing from the Footſteps of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for I wanted very much that <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould make an end, but this Expreſſion ſet him on foot again. Ay, marry, anſwer'd <hi>Thomas,</hi> if I were to go thro' our County, I warrant I could tell you half a ſcore more. There is the Lawyer who came down with Eſq; <hi>Bramble,</hi> and bought Eſq; <hi>Clover</hi>'s Eſtate, but he's but a new Comer among us, they ſay, has
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0544800100:68"/>got a Notion of Money in that <hi>South Sea;</hi> but I think he is like to do but little good with it. How ſo, ſaid I? How, anſwered <hi>Thomas,</hi> he brought a young Damſel, with her wide Petticoats down with him, to be his Houſe-keeper, as I underſtand; and when I went to him about an Affair of my Wife's Brother, who was one of Eſq; <hi>Clover</hi>'s Tenants before this new one came among us, who ſhould come to ſpeak to me but this Whisk? I told her I had no Buſineſs with her, but I wanted her Maſter; but the Flirt ſcoffed at me, and ask'd one of the fine Fellows that was in the Hall, what the Country Calf meant; but I heard her well enough, and I think I gave her her own. I told her there was no ſuch Cattle as ſhe ever us'd to be in this Houſe before. This ſomewhat heightned my Curioſity, whereupon I ask'd him if he ſaw the new Eſq; Ay, marry, anſwered <hi>Thomas;</hi> after I had waited till I was welly tir'd; I was at laſt brought in to his Worſhip, who was ſitting in a fine ſilk Robe, like a Lady, picking and ſcraping his Nails with a fine Tortoiſeſhell Knife; but how ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were things alter'd there from what they were in Eſq; <hi>Clover</hi>'s Time? I came away without being ſo muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as ask'd to drink a Cup of ſmall Beer, tho' I had come above ſeven Miles that Morning. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to him that it was not the Cuſtom among Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who had been us'd to Buſineſs about <hi>London,</hi> to drink before Dinner, and that moſt Men were apt to judge of other Peoples Inclinations by their own; that it might perhaps be otherwiſe when he came to be acquainted with the manner of the Country, and as for keeping a good neat Houſe-keeper, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid ſuch Things were not much thought of in our Times. By the Maſs, reply'd <hi>Thomas,</hi> I think that's bad enough, tho' I could ee'n almoſt pardon that too, if he were good for any Thing in other Matters; but the ſecond or third Day after he came to his new Eſtate, he caus'd two little Cottages in the Lane, as ye go up to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0544800100:69"/>the Houſe, to be pulled down, which had ſtood there, for ought I know, all Eſq; <hi>Clover</hi>'s Time, and the poor People and their little ones have been forc'd o lie in the Barns ever ſince, and, as I underſtand, it was to pleaſe this Wagtail, for ſhe ſaid they and their Brats ſtunk with Naſtineſs. I could not indeed but take Notice of that as an Act of great Cruelty; but <hi>Thomas</hi> told me, there was a Copſe of Shrub upon the Brook-ſide on his Ground, which us'd, Time out of Mind, to be free to all the poor People thereabouts to gather Sticks to burn, and that he had given out Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, if any preſum'd to go there any more, he would ſend them to the Houſe of Correction. That he had alſo ſtop'd up the Water-Courſe to a Gentleman's Mill, which ran through his Ground; and ſaid he would oblige him to pay a new Fine, becauſe he found the Gentleman had omitted for two or three Years giving ſome ſmall Thing to Squire <hi>Clover,</hi> that was to be paid every Year as an Acknowledgment for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other Inſtances, the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told me concerning this Gentleman's Conduct, which were not only ungenerous, but cruel; and, if rightly look'd into, muſt be alſo accounted fooliſh and imprudent; and he was going on to give us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Misbehaviour of ſome other Gentlemen in the ſame Neighbourhood; but altho' there might be ſome Inſtruction gather'd from all he ſaid, yet I had not Time to hear more of them, eſpecially with the Circumſtances which are uſual in his way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing them. I told him, I ſhould be glad to be further inform'd in thoſe Things, when I had more Leiſure; whereupon he ſum'd up all in this general Obſervation: Verily, ſaid he, I thought we had been like our Neighbours, but mayhap other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries may be better than ours, and may have ſuch fine Gentlemen in them as you have been talking of; but I wot they are but thin in our Parts; unleſs it be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0544800100:70"/>Squire <hi>Pitfal,</hi> and ſome other honeſt Gentlemen; there are but few of our great ones will ſuffer poor Men to get any thing under them.</p>
            <p>But this gave the Clergyman an Opportunity to reaſſume his Diſcourſe. He obſerv'd, that altho' Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were, next to Health, one of the greateſt tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bleſſings to all thoſe who knew how to uſe them aright; yet nothing could be ſo great a Snare, and ſo deſtructive to Perſons of vicious Inclinations, as they were the proper Food and Nouriſhment of all their Luſts; and becauſe of the Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which accompany'd them, he ſaid, when they were once in the Poſſeſſion of bad Men, they were like a Sword in the Hands of a Tyrant, which cut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy, as they enabled ſuch the more violently to oppreſs others. He took notice, that many of thoſe who were born to great Fortunes, were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Bleſſing to their Country, as were alſo thoſe who acquir'd a moderate Subſtance by their honeſt Induſtry and Labour; but, on the other hand, that ſuch who became Maſters of very great and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Acquiſitions by their boundleſs Avarice, were for the moſt part a Plague to all who were about them, or had any Concerns with them; and that he believ'd there was no Country more than another free from ſuch Perſons, who being emulous, or rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, at the Proſperity and good Fortune of others, ſtuck at nothing to come up with them, tho' by all the cruel Methods of Oppreſſion. He obſerv'd, as the Body was nouriſh'd by its proper Food, ſo a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our Deſires and Inclinations was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Food of our Minds, but with this Difference, that the Body was often ſatisfy'd, and even ſurfeited, but the Mind could ſeldom have enough, eſpecially when it was guided by vicious Appetites; it might indeed be heated and intoxicated, but that would, like all other Drunkenneſs, only increaſe the Thirſt. This he obſerv'd was ſo manifeſt, with reſpect to Riches,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0544800100:71"/>that no one could be inſenſible of it, after ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal an Infatuation of that kind as had happen'd late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among us; but what, ſaid he, muſt have been the End of all this, had every thing ſucceeded according to Mens vain Wiſhes? Any one who had been but ſome few Years out of his native Country, would have hardly known it upon his Return, the Face of Things would have been ſo ſtrangely chang'd, and the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of Men paſſing through ſo many Hands, would have, no doubt, caus'd as many Alterations as there were different Humours and Paſſions in thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to have been gratify'd; what one would have built, another would have pull'd down, and what one had planted, another would have ſoon rooted up; and ſuch an infinite Number of ſtrange Projects would have been ſet on Foot, as were never heard of before. But he took notice, that the Methods of Providence were for the moſt part deliberate and ſlow, eſpecially thoſe that were the moſt favourable; and tho' the Wheel was indeed turn'd more about, at ſome particular Times, than what is ordinary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many ſtrange Revolutions were accompliſh'd, yet ſuch Things did not happen often, neither would we be able to bear them, if they were either to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, or the Hurry of them was to laſt any Time.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Pitfal,</hi> as himſelf was deeplieſt engag'd in this Affair, and had hitherto underſtood but little of the Matter, was therefore willing to know ſomething more particularly about it. He put a Stop to the Clergyman, while he was making thoſe general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and ask'd him, What he judg'd to be the Reaſon why the <hi>Stocks</hi> had riſen ſo high? And why, all of a ſudden, they ſhould fall ſo low? To this he made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That Mens Avarice had, no doubt, been the Cauſe of the prodigious Riſe, as that extraordinary Height was with no leſs Probability the Occaſion of the Fall. He obſerv'd to him, that according to the Footing it was put upon, the Advantages to every Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0544800100:72"/>were in a great Meaſure to be proportional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Advantage of Credit; and for that Reaſon, as the Credit was advanc'd, the Number of Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers alſo increas'd, which was eaſily enough to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in a Nation ſo rich and populous as this is. The Gains that ſome boaſted of, and that others had really made, ſet all Perſons agog after it, and ſo ſweet was the Proſpect of getting ſuddenly rich, that thoſe were look'd upon as Fools and Aſſes who had the leaſt Diffidence in it; as on the other hand, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Blockneads were countenanc'd, who could glean up any thing to its Advantage, tho' never ſo abſurd and ridiculous. He obſerv'd, that as moſt Perſons, who were concern'd in it, had their own private Gains chiefly in view, and thought but little of the Publick; whatever therefore they had ventur'd, was only with a Deſign to transfer it to ſome other Hand, as ſoon as they imagin'd it come to its utmoſt; and as there were but few, however, forward in it, who car'd to truſt it longer than while it was upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hand, it muſt have had the ſame Fate at whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Time it came to a ſtand; and unleſs the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Credit was no more than could bear a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Balance with our real Subſtance, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that it could be ſupported, eſpecially, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the various Humours, Intereſts, and Tempers of Men, and the vaſt Numbers concern'd in it, but muſt be like a Ship at Sea, which is apt to ſink when ſhe is either over-burden'd with too much Sail, or oppreſs'd with too high and violent Winds. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that evil Humour which he obſerv'd to run more or leſs through the whole Body, he ſaid, it was to be fear'd ſome of the principal Members were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in fault, both in the exceſſive Riſe and Fall; and as the Eyes of all Perſons were, no doubt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who were moſt deeply concern'd, their Example could not avoid being ſtrictly follow'd; and the Conſequence of this muſt be to ſink the publick
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0544800100:73"/>Credit very much lower than was any ways rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p>Upon this, Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> ask'd him, Whether he thought it would riſe again? He made Anſwer, As the Hopes of getting Riches had encourag'd People to adventure boldly, and become Proprietors even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what many of them were able; ſo, after ſo great a Damp, the Fear of loſing, as that was of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, if not ſuperiour Importance on the Mind, would, no doubt, hinder many for ſome Time from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Purchaſers; but yet as there was perhaps no juſt Reaſon for its ſinking ſo low; and as there was ſuch a vaſt Number of Perſons, and thoſe of all Ranks, immediately concern'd in it, and as the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was now in a manner link'd into it, it was not therefore improbable, but ſuch prudent Meaſures would be taken, as would not only in time raiſe it to a moderate Height, but alſo ſupport it; and it was likewiſe to be hop'd, that thoſe who had hitherto on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Eye to their own private Intereſt, would hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward believe, as they were all Members of the ſame Body, that nothing would in the End turn ſo much to their real Account, as conſulting the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of other Perſons, as well as their own.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pitfal</hi> began now to be more chearful, and his country Neighbour was no leſs encourag'd to ſee him ſo; he jog'd him on the Arm, and drank to his good Succeſs, telling him, That he hop'd to ſee <hi>Maple-Hall</hi> new built in a ſhorter Time than he thought for; and after the Glaſs had gone round, and that I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take my Leave of him, I deſir'd him to be of good Courage, to wait with Patience, and not to be troubled or anxious about his Intereſt in the Publick; ſince, as the Gentleman had obſerv'd, the ableſt and greateſt Men in the Nation were concern'd in it as well as he, and that therefore there would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Care taken of it; and as he was to go ſhortly into the Country, I put him in Remembrance of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0544800100:74"/>Advice I had already given him, to keep himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employ'd i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſome uſeful Buſineſs or another, and, at proper times, ſaid he might alſo drink a Glaſs, in Moderation, with his Friends, which would not only be the likelieſt Means to recover him, but alſo to preſerve him in a perfect State of Health, as the Intervals of Buſineſs and Company would keep off all melancholy Reflexions.</p>
