            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE it is the fate of dramatic works to undergo a much more ſevere ſcrutiny than any other of the efforts of the mind; authors, in this predicament, are juſtifiable in taking every opportunity of ſpeaking in their own behalf, and the egotiſm ſhould be, and is, by the candid, readily forgiven them. The applauſes beſtowed upon DUPLICITY, in the Theatre, have equalled my fondeſt hopes; and ſelf-love itſelf cannot accuſe the auditors of ingratitude, or want of penetration. But though there are ſcenes happy enough to have given univerſal ſatisfaction, there are others that have been called vulgarities, damned ſtuff, and by other conciſe and ſummary epithets, which men accuſtomed to decide without deigning to reaſon, have invented and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to their own proper uſe. I do not mean to affirm there is no truth in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks: I am, perhaps, the perſon leaſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified of any to pronounce, with ſafety, on the merits or demerits of the work. Fathers, who are the moſt free from prejudice, cannot ſee
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0822600800:4"/>thoſe defects in their offspring, which are obvious to others. In the rapidity of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, blemiſhes are ſuffered to eſcape, through a laudable attention to things of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and, like an ugly face, preſently become too familiar to be diſguſting. It is, for this reaſon, dangerous to commit any thing to paper, which the judgment, at the firſt perception, condemns. A work of any conſequence is read and reconſidered ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, that the ideas at laſt loſe both novelty and force, and the writer is diſguſted to find thoſe things, which, when firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, gave him ſo much pleaſure, become vapid, and aſſume the appearance of common place. For theſe reaſons, I ſay, it would be arrogant in me to ſpeak decidedly; I can only alledge what were my original motives for writing as I have done.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Comic Drama has long been renowned for humour; and when, about fourteen years ago, the French <hi>Comédie Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyante,</hi> or, as we call it, Sentimental Comedy, was introduced, the complaint was, that we had loſt all the ſpirit of our old writers, and were dwindled into mere tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators. The town was in this temper when Dr. Goldſinith's Comedy of SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER was produced, in which, humour, alone, ſeems to be the chief intention of the Author, and which gave a fatal blow to mere ſentimental dialogue. The ſucceſs of this
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0822600800:5"/>piece rouzed later writers from the ſoft ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the heart, and wit and humour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came commodities in great requeſt. The road to fame, though difficult, was obvious; and it would have been unpardonable for a young traveller, at his firſt out-ſet, ſo far to have miſtaken, as not to have attempted it. The difficulties and dangers have increaſed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in a vaſt proportion. I need only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL; and every diſcerning critic will immediately recollect how, and why.</p>
            <p>In the Comedy of DUPLICITY, the 'ſquire and his ſiſter are characters that, in their own nature, cannot admit of delicate ſtrokes; and, if I have erred, it is not, I believe, ſo much in the colouring, as in the choice of my ſubject. An Author in his firſt attempt, is ſeldom impreſſed with that awe for the Public which is requiſite, but ventures many things, that, perhaps, have their excellencies in reading, but that appear rude, abrupt, or indelicate, when pronounced before a large aſſembly. Were the humour of Smollet, which never fails to excite laughter in the cloſet, ſpoken upon the ſtage, it would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently excite univerſal diſguſt. Characters of broad humour are become peculiarly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, becauſe they are become far leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. A ſenſe of propriety ſpreads in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as people read, and reading is an infallible conſequence of riches. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0822600800:6"/>duces delicate ſenſations in thoſe who have acquired ſuch a ſtrict ſenſe of propriety, and they are offended when they ſee things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on the ſtage which, they ſuppoſe, do not exiſt in real life; though there are a thouſand living characters, a thouſand incidents at which, if exhibited, an audience would revolt, merely on the ſcore of improbability.</p>
            <p>Whatever the execution may have been, the intention of this Comedy is of a far nobler nature than the mere incitement of riſibility: the vice it pretends to correct is become truly enormous; and I would rather have the merit of driving one man from the gaming-table, than of making a whole theatre merry.</p>
            <p>I have, likewiſe, been accuſed by ſome of imitation, and want of originality. It is ſaid, I have ſtolen an incident from one piece, and a character from another, and that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the play of a player. This laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, I believe, would never have been made, had I not been known to be a player. The accuſations, which have the greateſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of truth, are, that LE DISSIPATEUR of Monſieur Deſtouches, and the Tragedy of THE GAMESTER, have furniſhed the great outlines of the plot. To theſe I anſwer, that, were it ſo, I would make no ſcruple of avowing it, becauſe I ſhould not think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf degraded by the avowal; but I declare the plot was finiſhed, and almoſt the comedy,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0822600800:7"/>before I ever read LE DISSIPATEUR: and if I have pillaged the GAMESTER, it was from latent ideas, of which I am unconſcious; for I have neither read, nor ſeen the GAMES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER for many years. A parallel circumſtance to that of Sir Harry loſing his ſiſter's fortune, is found, I am told, in the GAMESTER; but this incident was added to DUPLICITY ſince it was firſt written, by the advice of a friend, to give a ſtrength to the denoument. But there is a ſtory told in the life of Beau Naſh, which, had theſe critics known, would have immediately pointed out the place whence, they might have ſworn, without the leaſt ſuſpicion of perjury, I had ſtolen my plot; and yet, had they ſworn, they would have been perjured, for I never read that ſtory till I had written my Play, and then, I confeſs, I was amazed at the ſimilarity.</p>
            <p>However, I repeat, had I taken my plot from any play or ſtory, I ſhould have made no ſcruple to confeſs it, becauſe I think it no diſgrace. The firſt of all poets invented none of his plots; I ſhall never be the ſecond, and yet I affirm I did invent mine; that is, as far as I myſelf am conſcious. The elegant Biſhop Hurd, in his diſcourſe on Poetical Imitation, has the following remark, among many others, which is applicable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion: <q>The objects of imitation, like the materials of human knowledge, are a common ſtock which experience
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0822600800:8"/>furniſhes to all men; and it is in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the mind upon them that the glory of poetry, as of ſcience, conſiſts. Here the genius of the poet hath room to ſhew itſelf, and from hence, alone, is the praiſe of originality to be aſcertained.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Comedy is now committed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgment of the true critic; and I have only to wiſh, it may receive as favourable a ſentence from him, as it has already expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced from the voice of an indulgent Public.</p>

                     <p>WELL, my dear Meliſſa, you will be a happy woman!</p>

                     <speaker>Meliſſa.</speaker>
                     <p>I have no doubt of it. The attention which Mr. Oſborne has ſhewn me, was not that of a man eager to gain the affection of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs by humouring her caprices, praiſing her beauty, and flattering her follies. He is obliging and well-bred, but ſincere; yet his diſapprobation is delivered with a delicacy that makes it more agreeable than ſome people's compliments.</p>

                     <p>Believe me, dear Clara, there is no danger; for if there be one man on earth more capable of making a woman happy than another it is Mr. Oſborne.</p>

                     <speaker>Meliſſa.</speaker>

                     <p>Entirely—The friendſhip of Mr. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and my brother is as ſincere as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of it was remarkable—Have you ever heard their ſtory?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                     <p>Never. You know my acquaintance with your family is but juſt begun; but, I hope, you will not think them words of courſe when I aſſure you that, ſhort as it is, I feel myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in its happineſs.</p>

                     <p>Oh! I am ſure you are ſincere—I know it by ſympathy—Well then, I'll tell you—Harry and Oſborne happened to be both abroad at the ſame time. As my brother was going to Italy, and paſſing through the mountainous part of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, he came to a hollow way, among the rocks, ſurrounded by trees and caverns. All on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, at a turning in the road, he beheld Oſborne, and his ſervants, attacked by ſix banditti, and ready to ſink under their wounds.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Meliſſa.</speaker>
                     <p>He had his governor, two ſervants, and the poſtillion—My brother inſtantly leaped from his carriage, ſnatched up his ſword and piſtols, andflew to the place of action.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Meliſſa.</speaker>
                     <p>He was not ſeen by the combatants, and took care to advance ſo near, before he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0822600800:13"/>fired, that he could not fail to do execution—He laid two of the banditti dead; and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who had diſcharged their fire-arms, and beheld Sir Harry's people running to the attack and levelling their pieces, fled.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                     <p>Thank you for that, my dear—you have given me breath.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Meliſſa.</speaker>
                     <p>The intrepidity with which Sir Harry ſaw Oſborne defend himſelf, and the fortitude he diſcovered when he was informed, as it was at firſt believed, that his wounds were mortal, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached my brother ſo powerfully to him, that he reſolved not to leave him in the hands of ſtrangers, but anxiouſly waited while he was under cure.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                     <p>This was a noble generoſity!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Meliſſa.</speaker>
                     <p>It was; and Oſborne was ſo ſenſible of it that, though he was going the other way, he would return with Sir Harry into Italy; and their friendſhip has continued ever ſince.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                     <p>But is it not ſtrange, my dear, that he cannot detach his friend, Sir Harry, from the GAMING-TABLE?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>But the report is, that Mr. Oſborne takes advantage of this weakneſs; that, while he publicly ſatirizes the practice, he privately bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by his ſuperior addreſs; and, in fact, has half ruined Sir Harry HIMSELF.</p>

                     <p>That remains to be proved, friend—Ever ſince your father's death, if I don't miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, I have been tolerably buſy, a little active,

                     <p>That's a lie, I believe—However, Sir—among the reſt of my cares, I was anxious to find a woman worthy of you—Nay, ſo ſolicitous was I about adjuſting preliminaries, that tho' the gout had laid an embargo upon a parcel of my fingers and toes, I reſolved to forego my own eaſe, and ſet ſail immediately, that I might convoy you ſaſe into the harbour of happineſs.</p>

                     <p>My grand object, the thing that, of all others, I have moſt at heart, is to ſee my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, Sir Harry, happy—As for myſelf, I feel I am growing old apace, and am almoſt tired of the farce of life.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vandervelt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why ſo, Sir Hornet? I am ſure you play your part excellently.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>No, no—I am rolling down hill apace, and as the firſt ſteep declivity may preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate me to the bottom, there are certain affairs I wiſh to ſee finiſhed, one of which is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Sir Harry.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                     <p>So the perſon you aſked concerning me, when I went out of the rooms, miſtook the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thought you meant Miſs Turnbull?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>So it appears, madam—And I was too much enraptured to ſtay to rectify miſtakes—when I negotiated the affair with 'Squire Turnbull, I ſtudiouſly avoided an interview with his ſuppoſed ſiſter, for fear the buſineſs ſhould wear a face of precipitate indelicacy.—And I thought if I could once bring you and Sir Harry together, I would leave the contingent poſſibilities to love, and the ſuperior good qualities and penetration of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0822600800:78"/>which I, rationally enough, concluded could not fail to produce the deſired effect.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Clara.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Sir Hornet, how did it happen that you did not enquire of me myſelf who I was?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Hornet.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why faith, madam, I had been ſo particular with you, and had ſpoken ſo freely on the ſubjects of love and matrimony, that I was afraid, if I made thoſe kind of enquiries, you would miſtake the matter, perhaps, and think I wanted to make love to you in my own proper perſon.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0822600800:87"/>the diſtracted wife, and widow's curſe, the orphans tears, the ſting of deſperation, and the red and impious hand of ſuicide; deſpiſe the folly that made the practice faſhionable; oppoſe its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive courſe, and for ever ſhun, for ever abominate, the deteſtable vice of gaming.</p>

               <l>INFORM me, you, at whom he ſeems to write,</l>
               <l>Don't this man's inſolence your ſpleen excite?</l>
               <l>Give the beau-monde impertinent advice?</l>
               <l>Proſcribe VINGT UNE—prohibit box and dice!</l>
               <l>Tell YOU of honour, infamy, undoing,</l>
               <l>And—impudently preach you out of ruin?</l>
               <l>Are cards and dice fit ſubjects for his fables?—</l>
               <stage>(<hi>laughs</hi>)</stage>
               <l>He'd better write a tragedy on E. O. tables?</l>
               <l>And why, with ſo much rudeneſs and ill-nature,</l>
               <l>'Gainſt PRIVATE vice urge acrimonious ſatire,</l>
               <l>Since legal lotteries flouriſh every year,</l>
               <l>And peers and pedlars run the mad career</l>
               <l>Of public ruin, in its full extent,</l>
               <l>And beggars game—BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT!</l>
               <l>Nay, once in ſeven years, in full perfection,</l>
               <l>Is play'd a game more deſp'rate, call'd, "ELECTION!"</l>
               <l>When each grave ſenator the cauſe promotes,</l>
               <l>And throws the main with—cogg'd and loaded votes;</l>
               <l>When honour, conſcience, juſtice, law, religion,</l>
               <l>Are ev'ry one, by turns, the plunder'd pigeon!</l>
               <l>But wherefore rail at games in any ſtation?</l>
               <l>Life is, itſelf, a game at calculation,</l>
               <l>In which Dame Fortune gains but little thanks,</l>
               <l>For each man ſwears HIS prizes are all blanks.</l>
               <l>So when your am'rous lover draws for wife,</l>
               <l>And wit and beauty link with him for life,</l>
               <l>Tho' twice ten thouſand vows of love were paid,</l>
               <l>To gain the charming!—dear!—angelic maid!—</l>
               <l>Tho' conſtancy and raptures were the theme!—</l>
               <l>Let but poſſeſſion chace the honey'd dream,</l>
               <l>His bouncing paſſion burſts like bonfire ſquib,</l>
               <l>And wit and beauty form—A CROOKED RIB!</l>
               <l>The lordly huſband takes a different tone,</l>
               <l>When once ſweet Miſs becomes "bone of his bone!"</l>
               <l>The tender epithet, the dying leer,</l>
               <l>Are chang'd to—"Damme, Madam, can't you hear?"</l>
               <l>For theſe, poor authors, who their pens employ</l>
               <l>To write down pleaſures which they can't enjoy,</l>
               <l>You, againſt whom they aim their boldeſt ſtrokes,</l>
               <l>Have too much NONCHALANCE to mind their jokes;</l>
               <l>You find them ſoporifics, quite compoſing,</l>
               <l>For all the while they're preaching, you are dozing.</l>
               <l>Our bard, who full of antiquated notions,</l>
               <l>Intends to cure the world by ſcenic potions,</l>
               <l>Gravely reſolves to ſet the nation right,</l>
               <l>If your applauſe ſhould crown his hopes to night.</l>
