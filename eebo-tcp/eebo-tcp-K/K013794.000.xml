            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN this Age of <hi>Theatric change,</hi> when TRAGEDIES have found themſelves to be COMEDIES, and CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEDIES have bordered upon PANTOMIME; nothing has changed ſo little as <hi>Pantomime</hi> itſelf. <hi>Harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> ſkips away his Paſſion;—<hi>Colombine</hi> foots it to the ſame Tune;—the choſen <hi>Lover</hi> ſlides acroſs the Stage, melancholy and gentlemanlike;—the <hi>Clown</hi> breaks his Head pleaſantly againſt the Scene, and the <hi>Father</hi> tumbles over him, in the ſame Way, and fortunately with the ſame Merriment, he has done any Time theſe Hundred Years.</p>
            <p>Theſe Witticiſms are certainly good ones, for they are undoubtedly the oldeſt, and of the longeſt ſtanding of any in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>But one Jeſt cannot unfortunately live for ever. In the Eaſt Indies, the ſame Joke laſts only a Twelvemonth, and is terminated by the Arrival of the next Ships.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, the Author of the Pantomime, in which the following Songs bear a Part, has attempted to ſtray from the beaten Road; but it is requeſted the Audience will not be alarmed. The
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0306201000:4"/>
Hero of to Night is not about to be a Man of Sentiment; tho' <hi>Othello</hi> might be ſuch with a black Face, he had not the good, or the ill Fortune, to have a Party-colour'd Jacket, which cuts ſhort all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent at once.</p>
            <p>The Novelty attempted to be dramatiſed To-night, takes its Riſe from the Writings of MISS AIKIN, and the HON. HORACE WALPOLE. The <hi>Caſtle of Otranto,</hi> and <hi>the Fragment of Sir Bertrand,</hi> form the Baſis of an Endeavour to bring upon the Stage ſomewhat of the Effects which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Midnight Horror, and Agency ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. What may be the Reſult of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, To-night muſt determine, for hitherto the Experiment has not been made.</p>
            <p>The Ghoſt of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> and the Witches of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> do not militate againſt this Aſſertion. Their Appearance, tho' out of Nature, was ſimple and not combined. The Clank of Chains, the Whiſtling of hollow Winds, the Clapping of Doors, Gigantic Forms, and viſionary Gleams of Light, attended not their Effects upon the Stage. The firm Mind certainly may laugh at all this; but if ever, on a late Winter Evening, at a well-told Story of an Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Company have found themſelves unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attentive, and ſometimes unwittingly look'd back;—if they have felt no Wiſh to part;—if imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly they have ſat more cloſely together, and heard the Summons to Reſt and Separation,—the retiring to a lone Chamber with Reluctance, not
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0306201000:5"/>
to ſay Diſquietude;—if all this has happen'd, then are we right in thinking there is ſomewhat of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, or Superſtition in theſe Matters, which Reaſon ſmiles at, but cannot prevail over.—</p>
            <p>If this is a Weakneſs, the greateſt and the beſt of all Times have felt its Force;—<hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> the great <hi>Duke of Marlborough,</hi>—and a Family of Rank in this Country, with whom the Author has had the Honor of being intimate, were remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Inſtances of this Truth.</p>
            <p>Mix'd up with lighter Things to counteract the Gloom, ſome Grains of this Species of Compoſition will form the Potion of the Pantomime in Queſtion; in other Matters the Author humbly hopes he ſhall not be more dull than his Neighbours have been before him: perhaps quite as nonſenſical, and ſometimes more abſurd.—He truſts, however, the Audience will not be diſpleaſed with him, for having ſubſtituted a <hi>talkative Attendant</hi> upon <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin</hi> in the room of the uſual <hi>Dumb Grimace</hi> of the <hi>Clown,</hi> or having given them the youthful Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Miſs WILKINSON as a <hi>Colombine</hi> in the Place of a <hi>Figurante.</hi>
