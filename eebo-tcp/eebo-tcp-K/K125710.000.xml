            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>They were, Madam; and as I copied them
myſelf in a ſeigned hand, there can be no ſuſpicion
from whence they came.</p>
               </sp>

                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>Did you circulate the report of Lady

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>That's in as fine a train as your Ladyſhip could
wiſh; in the common courſe of things, I think it muſt
reach Mrs. Clacket's ears within twenty-four hours,
and then the buſineſs, you know, is as good as done.</p>
               </sp>

                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>True Madam, and has been tolerably ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
in her day; to my knowledge ſhe has been the
cauſe of ſix matches being broken off, and three ſons
diſinherited; of four forced elopments, as many cloſe
confinements, nine ſeparate maintenances, and two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces;
—nay, I have more than once traced her cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a <hi>tete a tete</hi> in the Town and Country Magazine,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1021100500:4"/>
when the parties never ſaw one another before in the

                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>Why yes, ſhe has genius, but her
manner is too groſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>True, Madam; ſhe has a fine tongue, and a
bold invention; but then her colouring is too dark,
and the outlines rather too extravagant; ſhe wants that
delicacy of hint, and mellowneſs of ſneer, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes
your Ladyſhip's ſcandal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>Not in the leaſt; every body will allow that
Lady Sneerwell can do more with a word or look than
many others with the moſt laboured detail, even though
they accidentally happen to have a little truth on their
ſide to ſupport it.</p>
               </sp>

                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my dear Snake, and I'll not deny
the pleaſure I feel at the ſucceſs of my ſchemes; <stage>(<hi>both
riſe</hi>)</stage> wounded myſelf, in the early part of my life, by
the envenomed tongue of ſlander, I confeſs nothing
can give me greater ſatisfaction, than reducing others
to the level of my own injured reputation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>True, Madam; but there is one affair, in
which you have lately employed me, wherein, I confeſs,
I am at a loſs to gueſs at your motives.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>I preſume you mean with regard to my
friend Sir Peter Teazle, and his family.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>I do; here are two young men, to whom Sir
Peter has acted as guardian ſince their father's death;
the eldeſt poſſeſſing the moſt amiable character, and
univerſally well ſpoken of; the youngeſt the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated,
wild, extravagant young fellow in the world;
the former an avowed admirer of your Ladyſhip, and
apparently your favourite; the latter attached to Maria,
Sir Peter's ward, and confeſſedly admired by her: Now,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1021100500:5"/>
on the face of theſe circumſtances, it is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
to me, why you, the widow of a city
Knight, with a large fortune, ſhould not immediately
cloſe with the paſſion of a man of ſuch character and
expectation as Mr. Surface; and more ſo, why you are
ſo uncommonly earneſt to deſtroy the mutual attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſubſiſting between his brother Charles and Maria.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>Then at once, to unravel this myſtery,
I muſt inform you, that love has no ſhare whatever in
the intercourſe between Mr. Surface and me.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>

                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>No! his real views are to Maria, or
her fortune, while in his brother he finds a favoured
rival; he is, therefore, obliged to maſk his real inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and profit by my aſſiſtance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet ſtill I am more puzzled why you ſhould
intereſt yourſelf for his ſucceſs.</p>

                  <p>Heavens! how dull you are! can't you
ſurmiſe a weakneſs I have hitherto through ſhame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
even from you? Muſt I confeſs it that Charles,
that profligate, that libertine, that bankrupt in fortune
and reputation, that he it is for whom I am thus anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and malicious; and to gain whom I would ſacrifice
every thing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, indeed, your conduct appears conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
but pray how came you and Mr. Surface ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>L.</hi> Sneerwell.</speaker>
                  <p>For our mutual intereſt; he pretends
to, and recommends ſentiment and liberality, but I
know him to be artful, cloſe and malicious. In ſhort,
a ſentimental knave, while with Sir Peter, and indeed
with moſt of his acquaintances he paſſes for a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
miracle of virtue, good ſenſe, and benevolence.</p>

                  <speaker>Snake.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I know Sir Peter vows he has not his
fellow in England, and has praiſed him as a man of
character and ſentiment.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Yes; and with the appearance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſentimental, he has brought Sir Peter to favour his
addreſſes to Maria, while poor Charles has no friend
in the houſe, though I fear he has a powerful one in
Maria's heart, againſt whom we muſt direct our

                  <p>Why, one evening, at Lady Spadille's
aſſembly, the converſation happened to turn upon the
difficulty of breeding Nova-Scotia ſheep in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
no, ſays a lady preſent, I have ſeen an inſtance
of it, for a couſin of mine, Miſs Letitia Piper had one
that produced twins. What, what, ſays old Lady
Dundizzy (whom we all know is as deaf as a poſt) has
Miſs Letitia Piper had twins.—This, you may eaſily
imagine, ſet the company in a loud laugh; and the
next morning it was every where reported, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that Miſs Letitia Piper had actually been brought
to bed of a fine boy and girl.</p>

                  <p>WHEN an old batchelor marries a young wiſe,
what is he to expect?—'Tis now about ſix
months ſince my Lady Teazle made me the happieſt of
men—and I have been the moſt miſerable dog ever
ſince.—We tifted a little going to church, and fairly
quarrelled before the bells were done ringing. I was
more than once nearly choaked with gall during the
honey moon, and had loſt every ſatisfaction in life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my friends had done wiſhing me joy.—And yet,
I choſe with caution a girl bred wholly in the country,
who had never known luxury, beyond one ſilk gown,
or diſſipation beyond the annual gala of a race ball.—
Yet, now ſhe plays her part in all the extravagant fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries
of the town, with as good a grace is if ſhe had
never ſeen a buſh, or a graſs plot out of Groſvenor-Square.

paragraphed in the news-papers—ſhe diſſipates my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

bear all this—but I am determined never to be weak
enough to let her know it—No! no! no!</p>

                  <p>You know, Sir Peter, I have often taken
the liberty to differ in opinion with you, in regard to
theſe two young men, for Charles, my life on't will 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1021100500:17"/>
retrieve all one day or other.—Their worthy father,
my once honoured maſter, at his years, was full as wild
and extravagant as Charles now is; but at his death
he did not leave a more benevolent heart to lament
his loſs.</p>

                  <p>You are wrong, Mr. Rowley, you are
very wrong;—by their father's will, you know, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
guardian to theſe young men, which gave me an
opportunity of knowing their different diſpoſitions;
but their uncle's Eaſtern liberality ſoon took them out
of my power, by giving them an early independence.
—But for Charles, whatever good qualities he might
have inherited, they are long ſince ſquandered away
with the reſt of his fortune;—Joſeph, indeed, is a
pattern for the young men of the age—a youth of the
nobleſt ſentiments, and acts up to the ſentiments he
profeſſes.</p>

your opinion at preſent, though I am ſorry you are
prejudiced againſt Charles, as this may probably be
the moſt critical period of his life, for his uncle, Sir
Oliver, is arrived, and now in town.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Peter.</speaker>
                  <p>What! my old friend, Sir Oliver, is he

marries a young wife, he deſerves—aye, he deſerves
—no—the crime carries the puniſhment along with it.</p>

                  <p>You forget the humble ſtate I took you
from—the daughter of a poor country 'ſquire—when
I came to your father's, I found you ſitting at your
tambour, in a linen gown, a bunch of keys to your
ſide, and your hair combed ſmoothly over a roll.</p>

                  <p>My evening employments were to draw
patterns for ruffles, which I had not materials to make
up; play at Pope Joan with the curate; read a ſermon
to my aunt Deborah, or perhaps be ſtuck up at an old
ſpinnet to trum my father to ſleep after a fox-chace.</p>

day laſt week, as Lady Bab Curricle was taking the
duſt in Hyde Park, in a ſort of duodecimo phaeton,
ſhe deſires me to write ſome verſes on her ponies; upon
which I took out my pocket book, and in a moment
produced the following:—</p>

reduced; he has applied by letter to Mr. Surface and

                  <p>Mr. Surface you muſt know, Ladies,
came late from Salt-hill, where he had been the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before with a particular friend of his, who has a

                  <p>They agreed each to take a piſtol—
They fired at the ſame inſtant—Charles's ball took
place, and lodged in the thorax. Sir Peter's miſſed,
and what is very extraordinary, the ball grazed againſt
a little bronze Shakeſpeare that ſtood over the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
flew off through the window, at right angles,
and wounded the poſt man, who was juſt come to the
door with a double letter from Northamptonſhire.</p>
