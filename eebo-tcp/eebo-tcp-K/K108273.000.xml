            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAW OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE, OR CHRISTIAN SUBMISSION to PERSONAL INJURIES.</head>
            <p>THE illegality of ſlavery among Chriſtians is a point which I have long laboured to demonſtrate, as being deſtructive of morality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently dangerous both to body and ſoul. There are nevertheleſs ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Texts in the New Teſtament, which, in the opinion even of ſeveral well meaning and diſintereſted perſons, ſeem to afford ſome proof of the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlavery among the primitive Chriſtians; and, from thence, they are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1083401500:3"/>induced to conceive, <hi>that Chriſtianity doth not oblige its profeſſors to renounce the practice of ſlaveholding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A learned and reverend correſpondent of mine ſeems to have adopted this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and has ſignified his opinion near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſame effect, in a private letter to me on this ſubject, to which I have not yet ventured to ſend him a reply, though it is a conſiderable time ſince I received his letter; but, to ſay the truth, the queſtion in which I had never before apprehended any difficulty, was render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſerious and important, upon my hands, by my friend's declaration; and I thought myſelf bound to give it the ſtricteſt examination, becauſe I conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as I do ſtill) that the honour of the Holy Scriptures, which of all other things, I have moſt at heart, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the determination of the point in queſtion; and yet I know, that my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1083401500:4"/>friend is full as zealous for the honour of the Scriptures as myſelf, and much more learned in them, being very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in that moſt eſſential branch of knowledge.</p>
            <p>I believe alſo that he is perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, and of undoubted <hi>Chriſtian benevolence.</hi> The objection has therefore acquired an accumulated weight from the authority and worth of the perſon who made it; and conſequently, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded more circumſpection and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to anſwer it in any reaſonable time, than my ſhort broken intervals of leiſure (the only time that I was then maſter of) would permit me to beſtow upon it; and as ſo much time has already elapſed, the anſwer which I originally intended for my friend's private peruſal, ſhall now be addreſſed to all well meaning perſons in general, who may have had the ſame motives for admitting in any degree the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1083401500:5"/>legality of ſlavery; and that there are many ſuch (even among thoſe that are concerned in the practice of ſlavehold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the example of my diſintereſted friend's opinion, and common charity, oblige me to ſuppoſe. I ſhall therefore conſider my friend's opinion as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon excuſe of our American and Weſt Indian brethren for tolerating ſlavery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among them.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>I do not think</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity releaſed ſlaves from the obligation they were under according to the cuſtom and law of the Countries, where it was propagated.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>This objection to my general doctrine <hi>is</hi> expreſſed in the moſt <hi>guarded</hi> terms; —ſo <hi>guarded,</hi> that it obliges me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the obſervation is, in ſome reſpects, ſtrictly <hi>true.</hi> My pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent attempt is not to confute, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1083401500:6"/>rather to demonſtrate wherein this <hi>truth</hi> conſiſts, which will afterwards enable me to point out ſuch a due limitation of the doctrine, as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it entirely conſiſtent with the hypotheſis, which I have ſo long labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to maintain, viz. <hi>the abſolute illega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſlavery among Chriſtians,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conformity to my worthy friend's declaration I muſt firſt obſerve, that the diſciples of Chriſt (whoſe <hi>Kingdom,</hi> he himſelf declared,—<q>
                  <hi>is not of</hi> THIS WORLD.</q> John xviii. 36.) had no <hi>expreſs</hi> commiſſion to alter <hi>the</hi> TEMPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL CONDITION OF MEN, but only to prepare them for a BETTER WORLD by the general doctrines of <hi>faith, hope, charity, peace and goodwill,</hi> (or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal love and benevolence to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) <hi>ſubmiſſion to injuries, dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which (though <hi>general</hi> doctrines) are amply and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1083401500:7"/>efficacious indeed, for the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> reformation of ALL CONDITIONS OF MEN, when <hi>ſincerity</hi> is not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the application of them; but the principal intention of the whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem is evidently to draw men from the the cares and anxieties of <hi>this preſent life,</hi> to a better hope in the <hi>life to come,</hi> which is Chriſt's proper kingdom: Chriſtian ſervants therefore were of courſe inſtructed to be <hi>patient,</hi> to be <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſive</hi> to their maſters, <q>
                  <hi>not only to the good and gentle, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> to the <hi>froward.</hi>
               </q> So that even <hi>ill uſage</hi> does not juſtify <hi>perverſeneſs</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in chriſtian ſlaves.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon the abſolute neceſſity of an unfeigned obedience in the behaviour of chriſtian ſervants to their maſters. <q>
                  <hi>Let every man abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Art thou
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1083401500:8"/>called being a ſervant? care not for it;</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. 1 Cor. vii. 21. and again, <q>
                  <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be obedient to them that are</hi> (your) <hi>maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of your heart as unto Chriſt; not with eye ſervice, as men pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the Will of God from the heart; with good will doing ſervice, as to the Lord, and not to men: knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doeth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be bond or free,</hi>" Epheſ. vi 5-8. Again,</q> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Servants obey in all things</hi> (your) <hi>maſters according to the fleſh; not which eye ſervice, as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs of heart fearing God: and whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.</hi> Coloſ. iii. 22, 23. The ſame apoſtle inſtructs <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to recommend obedience to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>'Let as many ſervants</hi> (ſays the apoſtle) <hi>as are under the yoke, count
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1083401500:9"/>their own maſters worthy of all honour, that</hi> THE NAME OF GOD AND HIS DOCTRINE BE NOT BLASPHEMED. <hi>And they that have believing maſters, let them not deſpiſe</hi> (them) BECAUSE THEY ARE BRETHREN; BUT RATHER DO (them) SERVICE, BECAUSE THEY ARE FAITHFUL AND BELOVED PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAKERS OF THE BENEFIT. <hi>Theſe things teach and exhort: If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words,</hi> (even) <hi>the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſs; he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions, and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evil-furmiſings, perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth, ſuppoſing that gain is godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. From ſuch withdraw thyſelf. But godlineſs with contentment is great gain. for we brought nothing into</hi> (this) <hi>world,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1083401500:10"/>and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.'</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 1 to 8.—And again he inſiſts on the ſame doctrine, '(Exhort) <hi>ſervants,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to be obedient unto their own maſters,</hi> (and) <hi>to pleaſe</hi> (them) <hi>well in all</hi> things, <hi>not anſwering again, not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loining, but ſhewing all good fidelity; that they may</hi> ADORN THE DOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRINE OF GOD OUR SAVIOUR IN ALL THINGS.</q> Titus ii. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>THESE Texts are amply ſufficient to prove the truth of my learned friend's aſſertion, ſo far as it relates to THE DUTY OF THE SLAVES THEMSELVES, but this <hi>abſolute ſubmiſſion</hi> required of Chriſtian ſervants, by no means implies the <hi>legality</hi> of ſlaveholding ON THE PART OF THEIR MASTERS, which <hi>he</hi> ſeems to apprehend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1083401500:11"/>THE ſlave violates no precepts of the goſpel by his abject condition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the ſame is <hi>involuntary</hi> (for if he can be made free, he is expreſsly commanded by the apoſtle to <hi>uſe it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1083401500:12"/>I HAVE already admitted, that CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIANITY DOTH NOT RELEASE SLAVES, <q>

               </q> agreeable to my learned friend's aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in favour of which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a variety of texts: but as <q>
                  <hi>the reaſon of the law,</hi>
               </q> (according to a maxim of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> law) <q>
                  <hi>is the life of the law,</hi>
               </q> we cannot with juſtice draw any concluſion from thence, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the maſter's claim, till we have examined the principles, on which the doctrine <hi>of ſubmiſſion,</hi> in theſe ſeveral texts, is founded; and we ſhall find, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a general view of the whole, that the principal reaſon of enforcing the doctrine was not ſo much becauſe the perſons to whom it was addreſſed, <hi>were ſlaves,</hi> as becauſe they <hi>were Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and were to overcome EVIL
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1083401500:13"/>with GOOD, to the GLORY OF GOD <hi>and</hi> RELIGION.</p>
            <p>THESE principles are clearly <hi>expreſſed</hi> in ſeveral of theſe very texts, and <hi>implied</hi> in all of them, viz. '<hi>That the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſphemed.</hi>' (1 Tim. vi. 1.) and again, <q>
                  <hi>that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> IN ALL THINGS.</q> (Titus ii. 10.) So that a zeal for the GLORY OF GOD, and of HIS RELIGION (the principles of the firſt great commandment) is the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ground and ſole purpoſe of the Chriſtian <hi>ſlave's</hi> SUBMISSION, which was therefore to be <q>WITH SINGLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS OF HEART AS UNTO CHRIST.</q> 
               <q>
                  <hi>not with eye ſervice,</hi> AS MEN PLEASERS, <hi>but as</hi> THE SERVANTS OF CHRIST, <hi>doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing ſervice,</hi> AS TO THE LORD, <hi>and</hi> NOT TO MEN: <hi>knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doeth, the ſame ſhall</hi> HE RECEIVE OF THE
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1083401500:14"/>LORD, <hi>whether he</hi> BE BOND OR FREE.</q> Epheſ. vi. 5-8. And again, the ſame apoſtle charges the ſervants among the Coloſſians, to obey <q>

            <p>THUS it is plain that the ſervice was to be performed 'as TO THE LORD,' and 'NOT TO MEN,' and therefore it cannot be conſtrued as an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>property</hi> really veſted <hi>in the maſter.</hi> This will clearly appear upon a cloſer examination of ſome of theſe texts. In the firſt, for inſtance, though the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> enforces the neceſſity of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to their maſters, in the ſtrongeſt manner, commanding them to be ſubject <q>
                  <hi>not only to the good and gentle, but</hi> ALSO TO THE FROWARD,</q> &amp;c. (1. Pet. ii. 18.)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1083401500:15"/>yet he adds in the very next verſe,—<q>

               </gap>, ſo that, it is manifeſt, the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did not mean to <hi>juſtify</hi> the claim of the maſters, becauſe he enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame ſubmiſſion to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that ſuffered <hi>wrongfully,</hi> as to thoſe who had good and gentle maſters: and it would be highly injurious to the <hi>goſpel of peace,</hi> to ſuppoſe it capable of authorizing <hi>wrongful ſufferings,</hi> or of eſtabliſhing a <hi>right</hi> or power in any rank of men whatever, to oppreſs others <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>! And though the apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> alſo, ſo ſtrongly exhorts ſervants to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their maſters, and <q>
                  <hi>to abide in the ſame calling wherein they were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
               </q> and '<hi>not to care for it.</hi>' (1 Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, vii. 20, 21.) Yet at the ſame time he clearly inſtructs them, that it is their duty to prefer a ſtate of <hi>freedom</hi> whenever they can fairly and honeſtly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1083401500:16"/>obtain it; <q>
                  <hi>but if thou mayeſt be made free</hi> (ſays he) USE IT RATHER.</q> (v.21.) And the reaſon, which he aſſigns for this command, is as plainly delivered, viz. <hi>the equality of ſervants with their maſters in the fight of the Almighty,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>For he that is called in the Lord,</hi> (being) <hi>a SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANT</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is the Lord's FREE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN:</hi> LIKEWISE, <hi>alſo he that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (being) FREE, <hi>is Chriſt's</hi> SERVANT.</q> (verſe 22.) <hi>Chriſt</hi> having purchaſed all men to be his <hi>peculiar ſervants,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>freemen.</hi>

BE NOT YE THE SERVANTS OF MEN,</q> which plainly implies, that it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the dignity of a Chriſtian, who is the <hi>ſervant</hi> or <hi>freeman of</hi> GOD, to be held in an <hi>unlimited</hi> ſubjection, as the bond <hi>ſervant</hi> or <hi>ſlave of a</hi> MAN; and, conſequently, that a toleration of ſlavery, in places where Chriſtianity is eſtabliſhed by law, is intirely illegal;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1083401500:17"/>for tho' THE SLAVE commits no crime by ſubmitting to the <hi>involuntary ſervice,</hi> (which has been already demonſtrated,) yet the CHRISTIAN MASTER is guilty of a ſort of ſacriledge, by appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himſelf, as an <hi>abſolute property,</hi> that body, which <hi>peculiarly belongs to God by an ineſtimable purchaſe!</hi> For if God ſaid of the Jews, even under the old law, (Levit. xxv. 52.) <q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, <hi>which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt;</hi> THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">My learned friend, (mentioned in the beginning of this Tract) has remarked that <q>
                     <hi>tho' God expreſſed himſelf concerning the Jews under the law in this manner.</hi> 
                     <q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, WHICH I BROUGHT FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN.</q> &amp;c. yet <hi>This did not ſignify</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that they were not to be ſlaves at all. They might be ſlaves for ſeven years, as is well known, notwithſtanding they were God's redeemed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Nay, they might remain ſlaves 'till the jubilee,</hi> WITH THEIR OWN CONSENT, <hi>at the expiration of that ſhort term of involuntary ſervitude. Theſe words indeed contained a declaration that none of the Iſraelites were to be ſlaves for ever like the Heathen. But what a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery proof,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of this exemption with regard to Chriſtians? How dangerous</hi> (continued he,) <hi>is it to build doctrines upon ſuch parallels and compariſons!</hi>
                  </q> But my worthy friend ſeems to forget that the kind of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which I oppoſe, is not that <hi>limited temporary ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> which he deſcribes <hi>as conſiſtent with the law,</hi> for that differs very little from the condition of <hi>hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> in which light, the Hebrew maſters were <hi>bound by the law,</hi> to look upon their brethren, even though bought with their money as bond ſervants or ſlaves, <q>

                  </q> Levit. xxv. 39, 43.

                     <hi>a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery proof</hi> of <hi>this exemption with regard to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
                  </q> and aſſerts that the text in queſtion <hi>does not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that they</hi> (the Iſraelites) <hi>were not to be ſlaves at all!</hi> It clearly <hi>ſignifies</hi> however, that whatſoever <hi>right</hi> a maſter might have acquired (even by an abſolute <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi>) over his Hebrew brother, yet that he was ſtill required to treat him as an <hi>hired ſervant,</hi> and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his</hi> at a <hi>limited time:</hi> and when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the parallel text in Deuterenomy, (xv, 12, 14.) we find the maſter is there ſtrictly enjoined to reward the Bond-man LIBERALLY for his paſt ſervices, viz. <q>
                     <hi>And when thou ſendeſt him out free from thee,</hi> THOU SHALT FURNISH HIM LIBERALLY <hi>out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine preſs,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c. Surely when the true nature of ſuch <hi>limited ſervitude</hi> is duly conſidered, it affords but '<hi>a ſlippery</hi> proof,' (if I may uſe my friend's expreſſion) <q>that <hi>they were to be ſlaves at all,</hi>

                  <hi>they</hi> are GOD'S SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANTS,</q> whom Chriſt hath redeemed with his own blood, as much as the Jews of old who were on that account expreſly <hi>enfranchiſed</hi> from worldly bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <q>THEY ARE MY SERVANTS, THEY SHALL NOT BE SOLD AS BONDMEN;</q> for this application of the text is entirely to the ſame effect as the apoſtle's expreſſion to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,—<q>
                  <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> BE NOT YE THE SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANTS OF MEN.</q> (1. Cor. vii. 23.)

Many learned men (and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> among the reſt) have conſtrued the words — '<gap reason="foreign">

<note n="‡" place="bottom">Theſe words are tranſlated by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> as follows, — <q>

            <p>Nevertheleſs I have contented myſelf with the common rendering, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1083401500:28"/>that no concluſions can fairly be drawn from this text in favour of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, even when the epithets <q>

                  <p>But my learned friend has entirely miſunderſtood the purport and intention of my arguments on theſe ſeveral texts relating to <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion.</hi> I have not attempted to prove, <hi>by theſe particular expreſſions of the apoſtle,</hi> that <q>
                        <hi>the connexion between Maſters and Slaves was looked upon by him as abſolutely unlawful,</hi> ſo that the former had <hi>no right to rule the latter;</hi>
                     </q> for this I have demonſtrated, I truſt, by OTHER AUTHORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES <hi>of Scripture</hi> equally authentic, and much leſs liable to be miſunderſtood. My attempt to explain the texts in queſtion extends no farther than to ſhew that they do not really <hi>juſtify the uncharitable claims of the modern Slaveholders,</hi> though they are frequently cited for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>An attempt to ſhew <hi>that any particular doctrine is</hi> NOT NECESSARILY IMPLIED <hi>in a certain text or texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is a very different thing from an attempt to PROVE or AUTHENTICATE AN OPPOSITE DOCTRINE <hi>by the ſame text of Scripture!</hi> For inſtance, when my learned friend aſſerts, as above, that the apoſtle to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, iii. 25. <q>
                        <hi>very clearly ſignifies that the right of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion remained, when he oppoſes</hi> DOING WRONG to OBEYING <hi>in all things their Maſters,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. I do not pretend to build an <hi>oppoſite doctrine upon the very ſame words,</hi> but ſhall only endeavour to ſhew that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>"right of dominion"</hi> is not neceſſarily <hi>implied</hi> in the text which my friend has cited in ſupport of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſervants are indeed expreſsly and plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> as well in this as in all the other texts before recited, ſo that a contrary behaviour in them might certainly be eſteemed a <q>
                        <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong</hi>
                     </q> on their part yet this by no means implies <hi>"a right of dominion"</hi> veſted in the Maſter; for that would prove too much; becauſe the like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is elſewhere equally enjoined to thoſe who are expreſsly ſaid to <q>

                     </gap>,) and we cannot ſuppoſe (as I have before obſerved) that the <hi>ſubmiſſion enjoined</hi> implies a <hi>right</hi> in the Maſter to exerciſe ſuch a <hi>dominion</hi> as that of <hi>oppreſſing others</hi> UNJUSTLY, or <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; for that could not poſſibly tend to promote the declared purpoſes of the apoſtle's exhortations, viz. <hi>"that the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſphemed,"</hi> (1 Tim. vi.) and again, <q>
                        <hi>that they may adorn the doctrine of God in all</hi> THINGS,</q> (Titus ii. 9.) Theſe purpoſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are fully anſwered in the advice given by the ſame apoſtle to all the other <hi>different relations of life</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by my worthy friend.

                        <hi>adorn the doctrine of God</hi>

                     </q> (See Coloſſ. iii. 18.) And HUSBANDS, by <hi>love</hi> to their <hi>wives:</hi> for they are expreſsly charged in the following verſe <q>
                        <hi>not to be bitter againſt them,</hi>
                     </q> that is, they muſt, by <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſincere affection,</hi> moderate and ſoften that ſupreme authority with which <hi>huſbands</hi> are entruſted, (by the laws of God and man,) that they may <hi>rule</hi> rather by the gentle influence of an inviolable <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> as ſo good an example will ſeldom fail to produce <hi>due reſpect,</hi> and will certainly <hi>"adorn the doctrine"</hi> or profeſſion of the Chriſtian. CHILDREN <q>
                        <hi>may adorn the doctrine of God</hi>
                     </q> by OBEDIENCE <hi>to their</hi>

                     </q> (v. 20.) And again, the reciprocal duty of FATHERS is plainly pointed out to be a prudent modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>paternal</hi> authority with which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, for they are carefully warned againſt an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſeverity, <q>
                        <hi>Provoke not</hi> (ſays the apoſtle) <hi>your children to anger, leſt they be diſcouraged.</hi>
                     </q> SERVANTS are in the very next verſe (v. 22.) commanded to <q>
                        <hi>obey in all things their Maſters according to the fleſh, not with eye-ſervice, as</hi> MEN-PLEASERS, <hi>but in ſingleneſs of heart,</hi> FEARING GOD:</q> ſo that the SUBMISSION of the ſervants was alſo to <hi>adorn the "doctrine of God,"</hi> it being manifeſtly enjoined only for <hi>God's ſake,</hi> and not on account of any ſuppoſed "RIGHT OF DOMINION" inveſted in the <hi>Maſters,</hi> which the following verſes (v. 23, and 24.) when <hi>applied to</hi> THE SERVANTS, ſufficiently demonſtrate,—<q>And <hi>whatſoever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord, and</hi> NOT UNTO MEN: <hi>knowing, that of</hi> THE LORD <hi>ye ſhall receive</hi> THE REWARD OF THE INHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITANCE: <hi>for</hi> YE SERVE THE LORD CHRIST.</q> And to the ſame eternal and unerring Diſpenſer of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> (and not to <hi>temporal Maſters</hi>) is attributed the power of puniſhing the <hi>"doing wrong,"</hi> mentioned in the very next verſe; which, according to my learned friend's notion, is <hi>oppoſed</hi> to <hi>obeying in all things the Maſters;</hi>—<q>
                        <hi>he that</hi> DOETH WRONG (ſays the text) <hi>ſhall receive for</hi> THE WRONG <hi>which he hath done: and</hi> THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.</q> (v. 25.)</p>
                  <p>Such ſtrict <hi>impartiality</hi> in the adminiſtration of juſtice cannot always be attributed, with certainty, even to the beſt-regulated <hi>human</hi> tribunal, and much leſs is it applicable to the deciſions of uncontrouled <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> in puniſhing <hi>"wrong doing,"</hi> under the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>dominion</hi> of Slaveholders! No earthly <hi>dominion</hi> whatever is conducted with ſuch an equal diſtribution of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments,</hi> as that it may always with truth be ſaid, <hi>"there is no reſpect of perſons,"</hi> for this is the proper characteriſtic of the <hi>judgements and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> of GOD and CHRIST alone. <q>
                        <hi>For</hi> THE LORD <hi>is</hi> JUDGE, <hi>and with him is</hi> NO RESPECT OF PERSONS.</q> Eccleſiaſticus xxxv. 12. "<hi>For there is</hi> NO RESPECT OF PERSONS <hi>with</hi> GOD." Rom. ii. 11. And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may fairly conclude that the puniſhment, not only of SLAVES, but that alſo of MASTERS, that <hi>"do wrong,"</hi> is to be underſtood in the text which my friend has cited to ſupport his notion of a <q>
                        <hi>right of dominion</hi>
                     </q> veſted in the <hi>Maſters;</hi> ſo that the ſaid ſuppoſed <hi>right</hi> has, indeed, but a very <hi>"ſlippery"</hi> foundation! Agreeable to my laſt remark on this text, (Coloſſ. iii. 24.) the learned Dr. Whitby has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented upon it, as if he thought it exactly parallel to another declaration of the ſame apoſtle, (viz. Epheſ. vi. 8 and 9.) wherein not only both <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> are unqueſtionably included, but alſo the <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or <hi>judgement,</hi> in <hi>which</hi> 
                     <q>THERE IS NO RESPECT OF PERSONS,</q> is expreſsly attributed to our <q>MAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER IN HEAVEN.</q> — <q>
                        <hi>Chriſt, in judging men at the laſt day,</hi> (ſays the Doctor,) <hi>will have</hi> NO RESPECT <hi>to the quality or external condition of any man's perſon; but,</hi> WHETHER HE BE BOND OR FREE, <hi>he ſhall receive recompence</hi> FOR THE GOOD THAT HE HATH DONE, <hi>in obedience to him; whether he be</hi> MASTER <hi>or</hi> SERVANT, <hi>he ſhall be puniſhed for</hi> THE WRONG THAT HE DOTH <hi>in thoſe relations.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If all theſe circumſtances be duly conſidered, it will manifeſtly appear, I truſt, that the Maſters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>"right of dominion"</hi> (which, certainly, is <hi>not</hi> EXPRESSED in the text) cannot even be <hi>implied</hi> in theſe contexts, nor in any of the parallel paſſages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready recited! Can the Maſter <hi>adorn the</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>doctrine of God our Saviour,</hi>
                     </q> (as in the other indiſſoluble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of life,) by continuing the unnatural <hi>connection</hi> of <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Slave,</hi> and by <hi>exacting</hi> involuntary labour from his <hi>brethren, without wages</hi> or <hi>reward,</hi> agreeable to my friend's notions of the ſuppoſed implied <q>
                        <hi>right of dominion?</hi>
                     </q> The reciprocal duty of the Maſter is mentioned, indeed, in the next chapter, (Col. iv. 1.) but it is of ſuch a nature as muſt neceſſarily lead Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Maſters to abhor any ſuch ſuppoſed <q>
                        <hi>right of dominion</hi>
                     </q> as that which is tolerated in the Britiſh colonies, and which my friend ſeems deſirous to defend! The <hi>Maſters</hi> are not directed by the apoſtle to claim as their own, by <hi>"right of dominion,"</hi> the <hi>labour</hi> of their ſervants WITHOUT WAGES, but, on the contrary, are expreſsly commanded to <q>GIVE <hi>unto</hi> (their) <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that which is</hi> JUST <hi>and</hi> EQUAL;</q> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends (as I have fully ſhewn in the preceding tract) ſuch a meaſure of <hi>generoſity, recompence,</hi> and <hi>benevolence,</hi> on the part of <hi>the Maſter,</hi> as is totally inconſiſtent with the claims and views of modern <hi>Slaveholders!</hi> and, if put in practice, would neceſſarily effect the entire abolition of ſlavery!</p>
                  <p>The Maſters are likewiſe carefully reminded, in the laſt mentioned text, that they <q>
                        <hi>alſo have a Maſter in Heaven.</hi>
                     </q> (Col. iv. 1.) — A <hi>Maſter,</hi> by whoſe example they are bound to regulate their conduct, ſo that this conſideration alone is a ſufficient antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>ſlavery;</hi> for the principal doctrine of <hi>that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſter</hi> was LOVE, which cannot ſubſiſt with the contrary <hi>exaction of involuntary ſervitude!</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>This is my commandment,</hi>
                     </q> (ſaid that glorious and gracious MASTER,) "<hi>That ye</hi> LOVE <hi>one another.</hi> AS <hi>I have</hi> LOVED <hi>you.</hi>" The nature of <hi>his love</hi> (which we are to imitate, that is, to LOVE <hi>as he hath</hi> LOVED <hi>us)</hi> is then immediately deſcribed as exceeding all bounds of compariſon, "<hi>Greater</hi> LOVE" (ſaid he) <q>
                        <hi>hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his</hi> FRIENDS. <hi>Ye are my</hi> FRIENDS, <hi>if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> HENCEFORTH I CALL YOU NOT SERVANTS.</q> Here is an expreſs <hi>enfranchiſement</hi> of <hi>his Servants</hi> for our example! The univerſal <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> of all men delights in promoting <hi>the dignity of human nature;</hi> which cannot be ſaid of the temporal <hi>Slaveholder,</hi> who enforces an imaginary <hi>"right of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,"</hi> by exacting an <hi>involuntary ſervice,</hi> and that for no other purpoſe than for the ſake of a little pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary gain, by depriving the <hi>labourer of his hire;</hi> which ſavours of no other <hi>love</hi> but <hi>ſelf-love;</hi> whereas, our diſintereſted Lord and Maſter hath even <hi>laid down his life</hi> through <hi>love</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> to his SERVANTS, and hath <hi>declared us free,</hi> as before recited. — <q>
                        <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I call you not</hi> SERVANTS; <hi>for the Servant</hi>
                     </q> (ſaid he) <q>
                        <hi>knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you</hi> FRIENDS; <hi>for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</hi>
                     </q> (John xv. 12-15.) And, in the 17th verſe, he again enforces his doctrine of LOVE: "<hi>Theſe things I command you,</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>that ye</hi> LOVE <hi>one another.</hi>" The meaſure of this indiſpenſible LOVE is expreſsly declared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <q>
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi> LOVE <hi>thy neighbour</hi> AS THYSELF. LOVE <hi>worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore</hi> LOVE (is) <hi>the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
                     </q> (Rom. xiii. 9 and 10.)</p>
                  <p>Such LOVE, therefore, is clearly incompatible with the arbitrary claims of the Slaveholder, who can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>ſaid</hi> to LOVE <hi>his neighbour as himſelf,</hi> nor to cheriſh that LOVE <hi>which worketh no ill to his neighbour,</hi> whilſt he ſtrenuouſly contends for ſuch <q>
                        <hi>a right of dominion</hi>
                     </q> as may enable him to exact, not only the <hi>involuntary</hi> ſervice of his <hi>neighbours</hi> and <hi>brethren,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of nature, but alſo to rob them of the <hi>fruits of their own labours,</hi> 
                     <q>GIVING THEM NOT FOR THEIR WORK;</q> againſt which practices a ſevere denunciation of WOE is expreſsly declared in the Scriptures; as I have fully demonſtrated in my tract on <hi>"the Law of Retribution,"</hi> as well as in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tract: and, therefore, as it is neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue difficult or dubious paſſages of <hi>Scripture</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with the general tenour of <hi>Scripture</hi> evidence, it would be highly improper to admit this <hi>oppoſite, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> of a ſuppoſed "RIGHT OF DOMINION," eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the ſame <hi>is not expreſſed</hi> in the text which my learned friend has cited for it, but is merely drawn forth by an imaginary <hi>implication!</hi>

<note n="(10)" place="bottom">
                  <p>(10) <hi>"The meſſage, our Lord here ſends to Herod,"</hi> (ſays a ſenſible and learned commentator, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Francis Fox,</hi> in his edition of the New Teſtament, with references ſet under the text in words at length,) <q>

            <p>This ſhews that the reprehenſion of magiſtrates and their officers, for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi> and <hi>abuſe of power,</hi> is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſtricteſt rules of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> PASSIVE OBEDIENCE: and, though the apoſtle Paul, in a ſimilar caſe, uſed much harſher language, yet his cenſure was undoubtedly <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and the ſeverity of his expreſſions was plainly juſtified (as I have already ſhewn) by the event! i. e. <hi>by the fatal cataſtrophe of</hi> ANANIAS. The law, therefore, which forbids <hi>the ſpeaking evil of the ruler of the people,</hi> is certainly to be underſtood with proper exceptions, ſo as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any juſt cenſure of <hi>rulers,</hi> when their <hi>abuſe of office,</hi> and the cauſe of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> may render ſuch cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1083401500:66"/>expedient and ſeaſonable. That the apoſtle Paul thus underſtood the text in queſtion, is manifeſt from his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of quoting it, when he was charged with <hi>reviling God's high prieſt,</hi> if the ſeverity of his cenſure be compared with the indifference which he ſhewed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately afterwards, towards the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Sadducee,</hi> by openly profeſſing himſelf to be of an oppoſite party, and by throwing an oblique charge againſt the whole body of Sadducees, as the principal authors of the unjuſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt himſelf,—<q>
                  <hi>I am a</hi> PHARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEE,</q> (ſaid he,) <q>
                  <hi>the ſon of a</hi> PHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RISEE; <hi>of the hope and reſurrection of the dead am I called in queſtion.</hi>
               </q> (Acts xxiii. 6.) Thus he manifeſtly threw the whole blame upon <hi>the Sadducees,</hi> and thereby ſhewed no inclination to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for the ſeverity of his ſpeech to their dignified chief!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1083401500:67"/>I muſt farther remark, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's behaviour, in openly oppoſing the <hi>high prieſt,</hi> (who, as ſuch, was alſo a <hi>chief magiſtrate</hi> and <hi>judge,</hi>) is by no means inconſiſtent with that excellent advice which the ſame apoſtle has laid down in the thirteenth chapter of his Epiſtle to the Romans, though it is frequently cited by the advocates for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, in order to juſtify their falſe notions concerning the neceſſity of <hi>abſolute ſubmiſſion and entire paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To an inattentive reader, indeed, the apoſtle's expreſſion may ſeem too much to favour ſuch doctrines, if the ſenſe and connexion of the whole context are not carefully weighed together; but though he ſaid,—<q>
                  <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that be are ordained of God. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1083401500:68"/>therefore, reſiſteth the power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the ordinance of God: and they, that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi>
               </q> Yet he immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſignifies what kind of <hi>rulers</hi> he ſpoke of "that were not to be reſiſted." "<hi>For</hi> RULERS" (ſays he in the very next verſe) <q>ARE NOT A TERROR TO GOOD WORKS, BUT TO THE EVIL. <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is</hi> GOOD, <hi>and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame; for he is the</hi> MINISTER <hi>of</hi> GOD <hi>to thee for</hi> GOOD.</q> (But ANANIAS, as <hi>a ruler,</hi> was certainly the very reverſe of this deſcription, ſo that the practice of the apoſtle, with reſpect to him, was by no means oppoſite to this doctrine.) <hi>"But"</hi> (ſays he) <q>

                  </q> (v. 10.)—This excellent man, I ſay, has left us by his own example an unqueſtionable precedent on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to demonſtrate that HONOUR IS NOT DUE to the higheſt temporal authority on earth, not even to a <hi>great national council of rulers and elders,</hi> while they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their authority in <hi>unjuſt</hi> proſecutions, and abuſe their power by enacting <hi>unreaſonable and tyrannical or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi> The great council of the Jewiſh ſtate had <hi>"ſtraightly commanded"</hi> the apoſties and diſciples of Chriſt (as I have already remarked in a preceding note) <q>
                     <hi>not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the name of Jeſus;</hi>
                  </q> which command, it ſeems, was given leſt their preaching ſhould <hi>"bring this man's blood"</hi> (ſaid the high prieſt, meaning the blood of our LORD JESUS) <hi>"upon us:"</hi> but <hi>Stephen</hi> paid ſo little regard either to the <hi>unlawful</hi> command itſelf, or to the reaſon of it, that he afterwards publicly upbraided the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, with the high prieſt at the head of it, (in the moſt ſtimulating and unreſerved terms,) as the betrayers and murderers of that juſt One!—<q>
                     <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed in heart and ears,</hi>
                  </q> (ſaid he to their faces in the public aſſembly,) <q>
                     <hi>ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt: as your fathers</hi> (did), <hi>ſo</hi> (do) <hi>ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers perſecuted? And they have ſlain them which ſhewed before of the coming of the</hi> JUST ONE, <hi>of whom ye have been now the</hi> BETRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS <hi>and</hi> MURDERERS,</q> &amp;c. (Acts vii. 51 and 52.) Words could not well be <hi>ſharper</hi> than theſe, which is manifeſt from their <hi>effect;</hi> for the text teſtifies that <q>
                     <hi>when they heard theſe things they were</hi> CUT TO THE HEART, <hi>and they gnaſhed on him with</hi> (their) <hi>teeth.</hi>
                  </q> (V. 54.) Thus it clearly appears that the holy, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and meek Stephen did not think himſelf bound (like our undiſtinguiſhing <hi>paſſive-obedience</hi> men) to <q>
                     <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every ordinance of man,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c. nor to <q>
                     <hi>honour all men,</hi>
                  </q> without making reaſonable and due excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! Nay, ſo far from <hi>honouring</hi> men merely on account of their <hi>temporal dignity,</hi> it is manifeſt that he treated the whole <hi>body of rulers</hi> with the utmoſt ſeverity and contempt, while he thought them <hi>unworthy of honour,</hi> and yet there is no doubt but that he moſt conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, on every occaſion, rendered <q>
                     <hi>honour to whom honour</hi>
