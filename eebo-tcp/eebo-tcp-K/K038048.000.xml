            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reader is requeſted to conſider this Performance as a GENERAL OUTLINE, with here and there ſome ſketched features, of a Work, the nature of which, is frequently alluded to in different parts of the Poem, and the Title is ſpecified on a ſeparate leaf at the end.</p>
            <p>What I ventured abroad ſome years ſince under the title of SYMPATHY—a poem, which on account of the intereſts created in the Heart, by the ſubject itſelf, was received by the Public with ſo much generous warmth—was intended to ſerve as a Preliminary to what I had farther to obſerve on SOCIETY, or a Proſpect of the HUMAN RACE, under the combined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of CLIME and GOVERNMENT, RELIGIONS, LAWS and LIBERTIES—From theſe, the tranſition to TYRANNY was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſtrongly in connexion; and from TYRANNY, I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf called upon by all the awakened emotions of HUMANITY, to conſider SLAVERY; but not only that ſpecies of it which conſiſts in buying and ſelling our <hi>Fellow-Creatures</hi> in Africa—BUT EVERY OTHER KIND, in EVERY OTHER PLACE. Views, therefore, of FREEDOM and BONDAGE, throughout the different parts of the globe, have been taken, as well from experience, as the beſt hiſtorical evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0660501400:4"/>In the order of my Poem on SOCIETY, perhaps the part which relates to the Inhuman <hi>Treatment</hi> of Negroes (for the <hi>Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> appears to me more criminal than the <hi>Traffic</hi>) might not have taken the lead; not from any idea that theſe unhappy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are leſs entitled to the Rights of Nature, or the Regulations of Society, then any other parts of the HUMAN SPECIES; but, becauſe, according to the ſeries I meant to obſerve, the Proſpect of the quarter of the Globe where this Trade principally ſubſiſts, would have been out of time and place. This objection being done away by the emulative Benevolence which is now excited in the Empire on this ſubject, it affords me the greateſt pleaſure that, by an <hi>anticipation</hi> of ſo much of what I had to remark on AFRICA as is confined to the Slave Trade (which, however, by no means exhauſts what remains <hi>yet</hi> to be ſaid in that diviſion of my future work) I have a fair opportunity, and at a ſeaſonable moment, to enforce the appeals of thoſe who have the ſtrongeſt claims on HUMANITY, in a performance devoted to its <hi>general</hi> intereſts.</p>
            <p>How far the <hi>entire Abolition,</hi> ſo warmly contended for by the ſupporters of this meaſure, may be conſiſtent with human policy, it is not my purpoſe particularly to enquire. It is not the <hi>name</hi> of Slave in <hi>itſelf,</hi> which produces the great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. An hired ſervant in Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ope may be as little at his own command, and deſtined to as hard labour as a purchaſed Negro in Africa; but the eſſential difference conſiſts in the one being guarded by the laws of the land, which ſpread before his perſon and his property a ſhield that defends him from every <hi>abuſe of power;</hi> and the other is left naked and defenceleſ to the "inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of office."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0660501400:5"/>HUMANITY requires that the RIGHTS OF NATURE ſhould be enjoyed by every <hi>Human Being.</hi> It is therefore againſt the ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing barbarity, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I am glad, however, to have it in my power to obſerve, that we have not ſuffered the HUMANITY of the French and other nations to ſurpaſs our own, at leaſt in <hi>one</hi> of our iſlands, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the following authentic extract from the Jamaica Councils will atteſt, dated <hi>November</hi> 20th, 1787.</p>
                  <p>"This day the Houſe of Aſſembly went into a Committee on the Conſolidated Slave Bill, and continued ſitting upwards of three hours; we underſtand, that by this Bill the whole ſyſtem of the law reſpecting Negroes, is entirely changed, a Council of Protection is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in each pariſh, and many humane proviſions are introduced for rendering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition eaſy and happy; it is alſo made felony, without benefit of clergy, to murder a Slave, a clauſe, which, to the great honour of the Houſe, paſſed without a ſingle diſſenting voice.</p>
               </note> the unqueſtionable cruelty, and the too well-atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horror, growing out of theſe, that I contend.—An abolition of <hi>theſe enormities</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary. For the reſt, whether the commerce flouriſhes or falls, is a matter of no moment to the Philanthropiſt: without engaging in the heats of political contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; without attending to the pleas of intereſt on the one ſide, or the ſallies of enthuſiaſtic zeal (though generous in its exceſſes) on the other, it is ſufficient to Him that the happineſs of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> is made independent on the tyranny of <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar individuals,</hi>—that the laws of <hi>ſubordination,</hi> in the different claſſes of SOCIETY, ſhould not violate the laws of <hi>humanity,</hi>—and that ſo much of <hi>liberty</hi> ſhould be allowed to every man, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to feel a conſciouſneſs of his being a link in the great chain of the community; and that till by ſome act of his own it is neceſſary for the <hi>good of the whole</hi> that he ſhould be conſidered as an outcaſt of ſociety, he is, by the Rights of nature and of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, entitled to protection from inſult, miſery and death.—So far as the <hi>wealth,</hi> can be reconciled to the <hi>happineſs,</hi> of nations, and the Eſtabliſhments of Civil <hi>Society</hi> to the Rights of Nature,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0660501400:6"/>every lover of his country muſt ſubſcribe: at the fame time, as the <hi>wealth of worlds</hi> cannot juſtify the leaſt wanton infraction of the <hi>laws of Humanity,</hi> whoever vainly attempts to ſupport an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the one, at the expence of the other, erects a building which hath its foundation in the ſands, and which muſt tumble into ruins at the ſlighteſt touch of Reaſon and of Truth.</p>
            <p>Under this plain Conviction, I have felt and written, and ſhall continue to feel and write, upon <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Slavery, Humanity</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> and I now ſubmit my Sentiments to the candid, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Public, without any undue conſidence of ſucceſs, or unmanly dread of miſcarriage.—I have not thruſt upon the world, what I wiſh it to honour with notice, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious approbation of ſome great, and good minds; but (very contrary to the caſe with which in earlier life I uſed to reconcile myſelf to haſty publication) were I not now to go to preſs till I was <hi>ſatisfied with my own performance,</hi> thoſe whoſe partiality diſpoſes them to praiſe, would blame me for unreaſonable delay; and thoſe, who are more prone to cenſure, would no more be indebted to me for furniſhing them with ſubject for the exerciſe of their favourite talent. On every great and national occaſion, however, our country has a claim on the beſt ſervices we have to offer; and wherever they fall ſhort of our wiſhes, or even of our own conceptions, the proverbial apology, that the <q>Intention ſanctifies the Deed,</q> ought to operate in our favour. Should the deed, in any meaſure, do juſtice to the intentions, in the <hi>preſent</hi> inſtance, applauſe will not be withheld, but it will only ſerve to animate my future exertions, to prove more deſerving of it.</p>
