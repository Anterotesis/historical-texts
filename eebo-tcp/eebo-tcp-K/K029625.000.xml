            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE monaſtery of CLUNI, from whence ABE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARD is ſuppoſed to write the following Epiſtle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Maſcon, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for his learning and humanity. Hiſtory ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the cenſure of the court of Rome.</p>
            <p>SAINT BERNARD alſo is connected with the ſtory of Paraclete. This great man ſtands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too reſtleſs and enterpriſing to be confined within the circle of monaſtic occupations, he ruſhed into the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0131302100:6"/>of active life, and took the lead in ſome of the moſt important tranſactions of that period. With an undiſciplined ardour peculiar to his character, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated his country into that ruinous meaſure, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cruſade. Behold him at another time haſtening to the conteſt that held all EUROPE in ſuſpence, which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the pretenſions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was ſeated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot never impeached his moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but it muſt be allowed that in his zeal againſt the innovation of new opinions, he has ſometimes left unregarded the ſuperior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the moſt intolerant and ſanguinary counſel: His perſecution however of ABELARD was prompted (according to the opinion of ſome authors) by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of jealouſy, alarmed at the ſplendid literary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſo young a perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0131302100:7"/>
ABELARD in the following epiſtle lays a conſiderable ſtreſs upon his ſentence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that ſpiritual humiliation was felt as the greateſt calamity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, ſuſpended their endearing offices, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the degraded offender.</p>
