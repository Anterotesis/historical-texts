            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LONDON:

MR. CADELL,) IN THE STRAND.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:0112200701:3"/>
            <p>THE melancholy duty of examining the Papers of my
deceaſed Friend devolved upon me at a time when I
was depreſſed by ſevere afflictions.</p>
            <p>In that ſtate of mind, I heſitated to undertake the
taſk of ſelecting and preparing his Manuſcripts for the
preſs. The warmth of my early and long attachment to
Mr. Gibbon made me conſcious of a partiality, which
it was not proper to indulge, eſpecially in reviſing
many of his juvenile and unfiniſhed compoſitions. I
had to guard, not only againſt a ſentiment like my
own, which I found extenſively diffuſed, but alſo againſt
the eagerneſs occaſioned by a very general curioſity to ſee
in print every literary relick, however imperfect, of ſo
diſtinguiſhed a writer.</p>
            <p>Being aware how diſgracefully Authors of Eminence
have been often treated, by an indiſcreet poſthumous pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of fragments and careleſs effuſions; when I had
ſelected thoſe Papers which to myſelf appeared the fitteſt
for the public eye, I conſulted ſome of our common
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0112200701:4"/>
friends, whom I knew to be equally anxious with myſelf
for Mr. Gibbon's fame, and fully competent, from their
judgment, to protect it.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch a ſanction it is, that, no longer ſuſpecting
myſelf to view through too favourable a medium the
compoſitions of my Friend, I now venture to publiſh
them: and it may here be proper to give ſome informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Reader, reſpecting the Contents of theſe
Volumes.</p>
            <p>The moſt important part conſiſts of Memoirs of Mr.
Gibbon's Life and Writings, a work which he ſeems
to have projected with peculiar ſolicitude and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of which he left Six different ſketches, all
in his own hand-writing. One of theſe ſketches, the
moſt diffuſe and circumſtantial, ſo far as it proceeds,
ends at the time when he quitted Oxford. Another
at the year 1764, when he travelled to Italy. A
third, at his father's death, in 1770. A fourth, which
he continued to a ſhort time after his return to Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne
in 1788, appears in the form of Annals, much
leſs detailed than the others. The two remaining ſketches
are ſtill more imperfect. It is difficult to diſcover the
order in which theſe ſeveral Pieces were written, but
there is reaſon to believe that the moſt copious was the
laſt. From all theſe the following Memoirs have been
carefully ſelected, and put together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0112200701:5"/>
My heſitation in giving theſe Memoirs to the world
aroſe, principally, from the circumſtance of Mr.
Gibbon's appearing, in ſome reſpect, not to have been
ſatisfied with them, as he had ſo frequently varied
their form: yet, notwithſtanding this diffidence, the
compoſitions, though unfiniſhed, are ſo excellent, that
they may juſtly entitle my Friend to appear as his
own biographer, rather than to have that taſk under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by any other perſon leſs qualified for it.</p>
            <p>This opinion has rendered me anxious to publiſh the
preſent Memoirs, without any unneceſſary delay; for I
am perſuaded, that the Author of them cannot be made
to appear in a truer light than he does in the following
pages. In them, and in his different Letters, which
I have added, will be found a complete picture of
his talents, his diſpoſition, his ſtudies, and his attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſlight variations of character, which naturally
aroſe in the progreſs of his Life, will be unfolded in a
ſeries of Letters, ſelected from a Correſpondence between
him and myſelf, which continued full thirty years, and
ended with his death.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented, that all the ſketches of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,
except that compoſed in the form of Annals, and
which ſeems rather deſigned as heads for a future Work,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0112200701:6"/>
ceaſe about twenty years before Mr. Gibbon's death;
and conſequently, that we have the leaſt detailed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the moſt intereſting part of his Life. His Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
during that period will, in great meaſure,
ſupply the deficiency. It will be ſeparated from the
Memoirs and placed in an Appendix, that thoſe
who are not diſpoſed to be pleaſed with the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
familiarities, and trivial circumſtances of epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
writing, may not be embarraſſed by it. By many,
the Letters will be found a very intereſting part
of the preſent Publication. They will prove, how
pleaſant, friendly, and amiable Mr. Gibbon was in
private life; and if, in publiſhing Letters ſo flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to myſelf, I incur the imputation of vanity, I
ſhall meet the charge with a frank confeſſion, that
I am indeed highly vain of having enjoyed, for ſo
many years, the eſteem, the confidence, and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a man, whoſe ſocial qualities endeared him to
the moſt accompliſhed ſociety, and whoſe talents, great
as they were, muſt be acknowledged to have been fully
equalled by the ſincerity of his friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Whatever cenſure may be pointed againſt the
Editor, the Public will ſet a due value on the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for their intrinſic merit. I muſt, indeed, be
blinded, either by vanity or affection, if they do
not diſplay the heart and mind of their Author, in
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0112200701:7"/>
ſuch a manner as juſtly to increaſe the number of his
admirers.</p>
            <p>I have not been ſolicitous to garble or expunge paſſages
which, to ſome, may appear trifling. Such paſſages will
often, in the opinion of the obſerving Reader, mark the
character of the Writer, and the omiſſion of them would
materially take from the eaſe and familiarity of authentic
letters.</p>
            <p>Few men, I believe, have ever ſo fully unveiled their
own character, by a minute narrative of their ſentiments
and purſuits, as Mr. Gibbon will here be found to have
done; not with ſtudy and labour—not with an affected
frankneſs—but with a genuine confeſſion of his little
foibles and peculiarities, and a good-humoured and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
diſplay of his own conduct and opinions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gibbon began a Journal, a work diſtinct from
the ſketches already mentioned, in the early part of his
Life, with the following declaration:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I propoſe from this day, Auguſt 24th 1761, to
keep an exact Journal of my actions and ſtudies, both
to aſſiſt my memory, and to accuſtom me to ſet a due
value on my time. I ſhall begin by ſetting down
ſome few events of my paſt life, the dates of which
I can remember.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0112200701:8"/>
This induſtrious project he purſued occaſionally in
French, under various titles, and with the minuteneſs,
fidelity, and liberality of a mind reſolved to watch over
and improve itſelf.</p>
            <p>The Journal is continued under different titles, and
is ſometimes very conciſe, and ſometimes ſingularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed.
One part of it is entitled "My Journal," ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
"Ephemerides, or Journal of my Actions, Studies,
and Opinions." The other parts are entitled, "Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides,
ou Journal de ma Vie, de mes Etudes, et de
mes Sentimens." In this Journal, among the moſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
circumſtances, are mixed very intereſting obſervations
and diſſertations on a Satire of Juvenal, a Paſſage of
Homer, or of Longinus, or of any other author whoſe
works he happened to read in the courſe of the day; and
he often paſſes from a Remark on the moſt common
event, to a critical Diſquiſition of conſiderable learning,
or an Enquiry into ſome abſtruſe point of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>It certainly was not his intention that this private and
motley Diary ſhould be preſented to the Public; nor
have I thought myſelf at liberty to preſent it, in the
ſhape in which he left it. But by reducing it to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>his literary occupations,</hi> it formed ſo ſingular
and ſo intereſting a portrait of an indefatigable Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that I perſuade myſelf it will be regarded as a
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0112200701:9"/>
valuable acquiſition by the Literary World, and as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of fame to the memory of my Friend. With the
Extracts from Mr. Gibbon's Journal will be printed,
his Diſſertations entitled "Extraits raiſonnés de mes
Lectures:" and "Recueil de mes Obſervations, et
Pieces détachées ſur différens Sujets." A few other
paſſages from other parts of the Journals, introduced
in Notes, will make a curious addition to the Memoirs.</p>
            <p>His Firſt Publication, "Eſſai ſur l'Etude de la
Litterature," with corrections and additions from an
interleaved copy which my Friend gave to me ſeveral
years ago, is reprinted as part of theſe volumes.</p>
            <p>Three more of his ſmaller Publications are alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed.
1. His maſterly Criticiſm on the Sixth Book
of Virgil, in anſwer to Biſhop Warburton. 2. His
own Vindication of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters
of his Hiſtory, in anſwer to Mr. Davis and others. And
3. His "Reponſe à l'Expoſé de la Cour de France,"—an
occaſional compoſition, which obtained the higheſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
in Foreign Courts, and of which he ſpoke to me
with ſome pleaſure, obſerving that it had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
even into the Turkiſh language<note n="*" place="bottom">At Peterſburgh and Vienna it was currently obſerved by the Corps Diplomatique, that the Engliſh Miniſtry had publiſhed a Memorial written not only with great ability, but alſo in French, ſo correct, that they muſt have employed a Frenchman.</note>.</p>
            <p>Of theſe various writings the Author has ſpoken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in deſcribing his own Life. I have yet to notice
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0112200701:10"/>
ſome articles not mentioned in his Memoirs, and which
will be found in this Publication. 1. A juvenile ſketch,
entitled, "Outlines of the Hiſtory of the World."
2. A Diſſertation, which he had ſhewn to a few friends,
on that curious ſubject, "L'Homme au Maſque de Fer."
3. A more conſiderable work, "The Antiquities of the
Houſe of Brunſwick;" an hiſtorical diſcourſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
about the year 1790. In this Work he intended
to appropriate ſeparate books: 1. To the Italian deſcent;
2. To the Germanic reign: and, 3. To the Britiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Houſe of Brunſwick. The Manuſcript
cloſes in completing the Italian branch of his ſubject.</p>
            <p>Among the moſt ſplendid paſſages of that unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
work may be enumerated, the characters of Leib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz
and Muratori: A ſketch of Albert-Azo the Second,
a prince who retained his faculties and reputation
beyond the age of one hundred years: An account
of Padua and its univerſity, and remarks on the epic
glory of Ferrara.</p>
            <p>The laſt Paper of theſe Volumes has the mournful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of being a ſketch interrupted by death, and affords
an honourable proof that my Friend's ardour for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of hiſtorical knowledge attended him to the laſt.
It is entitled merely, "An Addreſs;" and expreſſes a
wiſh that our Latin memorials of the middle ages, the
"Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum," may be publiſhed in
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0112200701:11"/>
England, in a manner worthy of the ſubject, and of the
country. He mentions Mr. John Pinkerton as a perſon
well qualified for the conduct of ſuch a national under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>In the collection of writings which I am now ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the preſs, there is no article that will ſo much
engage the public attention as the Memoirs. I will
therefore cloſe all I mean to ſay as their Editor, by
aſſuring the Reader, that, although I have in ſome
meaſure newly arranged thoſe intereſting Papers, by
forming one regular narrative from the Six different
ſketches, I have nevertheleſs adhered with ſcrupulous
fidelity to the very words of their Author; and I uſe
the letter S. to mark ſuch Notes of my own, as it ſeemed
neceſſary to add.</p>
            <p>It remains only to expreſs a wiſh, that in diſcharging
this lateſt office of affection, my regard to the memory of
my Friend may appear, as I truſt it will do, proportioned
to the high ſatisfaction which I enjoyed for many years in
poſſeſſing his entire confidence, and very partial attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

OF
MY LIFE AND WRITINGS.</head>
            <p>IN the fifty-ſecond year of my age, after the completion of an
arduous and ſucceſsful work, I now propoſe to employ ſome
moments of my leiſure in reviewing the ſimple tranſactions of a
private and literary life. Truth, naked, unbluſhing truth, the firſt
virtue of more ſerious hiſtory, muſt be the ſole recommendation of
this perſonal narrative. The ſtyle ſhall be ſimple and familiar: but
ſtyle is the image of character; and the habits of correct writing
may produce, without labour or deſign, the appearance of art and
ſtudy. My own amuſement is my motive, and will be my reward:
and if theſe ſheets are communicated to ſome diſcreet and indulgent
friends, they will be ſecreted from the public eye till the author ſhall
be removed beyond the reach of criticiſm or ridicule<note n="*" place="bottom">This paſſage is found in one only of the ſix ſketches, and in that which ſeems to have been the firſt written, and which was laid aſide among looſe papers. Mr. Gibbon, in his communications with me on the ſubject of his Memoirs, a ſubject which he had never mentioned to any other perſon, expreſſed a determination of publiſhing them in his lifetime; and never appears to have departed from that reſolution, excepting in one of his letters annexed, in which he intimates a doubt, though rather careleſsly, whether in his time, or at any time, they would meet the eye of the public.—In a converſation, however, not long before his death, it was ſuggeſted to him, that, if he ſhould make them a full image of his mind, he would not have nerves to publiſh them in his lifetime, and therefore that they ſhould be poſthumous;—He anſwered, rather eagerly, that he was determined to publiſh them <hi>in his lifetime.</hi> S.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0112200701:27"/>
A lively deſire of knowing and of recording our anceſtors ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
prevails, that it muſt depend on the influence of ſome common
principle in the minds of men. We ſeem to have lived in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of our forefathers; it is the labour and reward of vanity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the term of this ideal longevity. Our imagination is always
active to enlarge the narrow circle in which Nature has confined us.
Fifty or an hundred years may be allotted to an individual, but we
ſtep forwards beyond death with ſuch hopes as religion and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
will ſuggeſt; and we fill up the ſilent vacancy that precedes
our birth, by aſſociating ourſelves to the authors of our exiſtence.
Our calmer judgment will rather tend to moderate, than to ſuppreſs,
the pride of an antient and worthy race. The ſatyriſt may laugh,
the philoſopher may preach; but Reaſon herſelf will reſpect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
and habits, which have been conſecrated by the experience of
mankind.</p>
            <p>Wherever the diſtinction of birth is allowed to form a ſuperior
order in the ſtate, education and example ſhould always, and will
often, produce among them a dignity of ſentiment and propriety of
conduct, which is guarded from diſhonour by their own and the
public eſteem. If we read of ſome illuſtrious line ſo antient that it
has no beginning, ſo worthy that it ought to have no end, we ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize
in its various fortunes; nor can we blame the generous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm,
or even the harmleſs vanity, of thoſe who are allied to
the honours of its name. For my own part, could I draw my pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from a general, a ſtateſman, or a celebrated author, I ſhould
ſtudy their lives with the diligence of filial love. In the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of paſt events, our curioſity is ſtimulated by the immediate or
indirect reference to ourſelves; but in the eſtimate of honour we
ſhould learn to value the gifts of Nature above thoſe of Fortune; to
eſteem in our anceſtors the qualities that beſt promote the intereſts of
ſociety; and to pronounce the deſcendant of a king leſs truly noble
than the offspring of a man of genius, whoſe writings will inſtruct
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0112200701:28"/>
or delight the lateſt poſterity. The family of Confucius is, in my
opinion, the moſt illuſtrious in the world. After a painful aſcent of
eight or ten centuries, our barons and princes of Europe are loſt in
the darkneſs of the middle ages; but, in the vaſt equality of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of China, the poſterity of Confucius have maintained, above two
thouſand two hundred years, their peaceful honours and perpetual
ſucceſſion. The chief of the family is ſtill revered, by the ſovereign
and the people, as the lively image of the wiſeſt of mankind. The
nobility of the Spencers has been illuſtrated and enriched by the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of Marlborough; but I exhort them to conſider the <hi>Fairy Queen</hi>
as the moſt precious jewel of their coronet. I have expoſed my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
feelings, as I ſhall always do, without ſcruple or reſerve. That
theſe ſentiments are juſt, or at leaſt natural, I am inclined to believe,
ſince I do not feel myſelf intereſted in the cauſe; for I can derive
from my anceſtors neither glory nor ſhame.</p>
            <p>Yet a ſincere and ſimple narrative of my own life may amuſe ſome
of my leiſure hours; but it will ſubject me, and perhaps with juſtice,
to the imputation of vanity. I may judge, however, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
both of paſt and of the preſent times, that the public are
always curious to know the men, who have left behind them any
image of their minds: the moſt ſcanty accounts of ſuch men are
compiled with diligence, and peruſed with eagerneſs; and the ſtudent
of every claſs may derive a leſſon, or an example, from the lives moſt
ſimilar to his own. My name may hereafter be placed among the
thouſand articles of a Biographia Britannica; and I muſt be conſcious,
that no one is ſo well qualified, as myſelf, to deſcribe the ſeries of my
thoughts and actions. The authority of my maſters, of the grave
Thuanus, and the philoſophic Hume, might be ſufficient to juſtify
my deſign; but it would not be difficult to produce a long liſt of
antients and moderns, who, in various forms, have exhibited their
own portraits. Such portraits are often the moſt intereſting, and
ſometimes the only intereſting parts of their writings; and, if they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0112200701:29"/>
be ſincere, we ſeldom complain of the minuteneſs or prolixity of
theſe perſonal memorials. The lives of the younger Pliny, of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,
and of Eraſmus, are expreſſed in the epiſtles, which they
themſelves have given to the world. The eſſays of Montagne and
Sir William Temple bring us home to the houſes and boſoms of the
authors: we ſmile without contempt at the headſtrong paſſions of
Benevenuto Cellini, and the gay follies of Colley Cibber. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of St. Auſtin and Rouſſeau diſcloſe the ſecrets of the human
heart: the commentaries of the learned Huet have ſurvived his evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
demonſtration; and the memoirs of Goldoni are more truly
dramatic than his Italian comedies. The heretic and the churchman
are ſtrongly marked in the characters and fortunes of Whiſton and
Biſhop Newton; and even the dullneſs of Michael de Marolles and
Anthony Wood acquires ſome value from the faithful repreſentation
of men and manners. That I am equal or ſuperior to ſome of theſe,
the effects of modeſty or affectation cannot force me to diſſemble.</p>
            <p>MY family is originally derived from the county of Kent. The
ſouthern diſtrict, which borders on Suſſex and the ſea, was formerly
overſpread with the great foreſt Anderida, and even now retains the
denomination of the <hi>Weald,</hi> or Woodland. In this diſtrict, and in the
hundred and pariſh of Rolvenden, the Gibbons, were poſſeſſed of
lands in the year one thouſand three hundred and twenty-ſix; and
the elder branch of the family, without much increaſe or diminution
of property, ſtill adheres to its native ſoil. Fourteen years after the
firſt appearance of his name, John Gibbon is recorded as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morarius
or architect of King Edward the Third: the ſtrong and
ſtately caſtle of Queenſborough, which guarded the entrance of the
Medway, was a monument of his ſkill; and the grant of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
toll on the paſſage from Sandwich to Stonar, in the Iſle of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0112200701:30"/>
Thanet, is the reward of no vulgar artiſt. In the viſitations of the
heralds, the Gibbons are frequently mentioned: they held the rank
of Eſquire in an age, when that title was leſs promiſcuouſly aſſumed:
one of them, under the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was captain of the
militia of Kent; and a free ſchool, in the neighbouring town of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenden,
proclaims the charity and opulence of its founder. But time,
or their own obſcurity, has caſt a veil of oblivion over the virtues
and vices of my Kentiſh anceſtors; their character or ſtation confined
them to the labours and pleaſures of a rural life: nor is it in my power
to follow the advice of the Poet, in an inquiry after a name—
<q>
                  <l>"Go! ſearch it there, where to be born, and die,</l>
                  <l>"Of rich and poor makes all the hiſtory."</l>
               </q>
So recent is the inſtitution of our pariſh regiſters. In the beginning
of the ſeventeenth century, a younger branch of the Gibbons of Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venden
migrated from the country to the city; and from this branch
I do not bluſh to deſcend. The law requires ſome abilities; the
church impoſes ſome reſtraints; and before our army and navy, our
civil eſtabliſhments, and India empire, had opened ſo many paths of
fortune, the mercantile profeſſion was more frequently choſen by
youths of a liberal race and education, who aſpired to create their
own independence. Our moſt reſpectable families have not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the counting-houſe, or even the ſhop; their names are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
in the Livery and Companies of London; and in England,
as well as in the Italian commonwealths, heralds have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to declare, that gentility is not degraded by the exerciſe of
trade.</p>
            <p>The armorial enſigns which, in the times of chivalry, adorned the
creſt and ſhield of the ſoldier, are now become an empty decoration,
which every man, who has money to build a carriage, may paint ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his fancy on the pannels. My family arms are the ſame,
which were borne by the Gibbons of Kent in an age, when the
College of Heralds religiouſly guarded the diſtinctions of blood and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0112200701:31"/>
name: a lion rampant gardant, between three ſchallop-ſhells Argent,
on a field Azure<note n="*" place="bottom">The father of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke married an heireſs of this family of Gibbon. The Chancellor's eſcutcheon in the Temple Hall quarters the arms of Gibbon, as does alſo that, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, of Charles York, Chancellor in 1770. S.</note>. I ſhould not however have been tempted to
blazon my coat of arms, were it not connected with a whimſical
anecdote.—About the reign of James the Firſt, the three harmleſs
ſchallop-ſhells were changed by Edmund Gibbon eſq. into three
<hi>Ogreſſes,</hi> or female cannibals, with a deſign of ſtigmatizing three
ladies, his kinſwomen, who had provoked him by an unjuſt law-ſuit.
But this ſingular mode of revenge, for which he obtained the ſanction
of Sir William Seagar, king at arms, ſoon expired with its author;
and, on his own monument in the Temple church, the monſters
vaniſh, and the three ſchallop-ſhells reſume their proper and heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
place.</p>
            <p>Our alliances by marriage it is not diſgraceful to mention. The
chief honour of my anceſtry is James Fiens, Baron Say and Seale,
and Lord High Treaſurer of England, in the reign of Henry the
Sixth; from whom by the Phelips, the Whetnalls, and the Cromers,
I am lineally deſcended in the eleventh degree. His diſmiſſion and
impriſonment in the Tower were inſufficient to appeaſe the popular
clamour; and the Treaſurer, with his ſon-in-law Cromer, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
(1450), after a mock trial by the Kentiſh inſurgents. The
black liſt of his offences, as it is exhibited in Shakeſpeare, diſplays
the ignorance and envy of a plebeian tyrant. Beſides the vague
reproaches of ſelling Maine and Normandy to the Dauphin, the
Treaſurer is ſpecially accuſed of luxury, for riding on a foot-cloth;
and of treaſon, for ſpeaking French, the language of our enemies:
<q>Thou haſt moſt traiterouſly corrupted the youth of the realm,</q> ſays
Jack Cade to the unfortunate Lord, <q>in erecting a grammar-ſchool;
and whereas before our forefathers had no other books than the
ſcore and the tally, thou haſt cauſed printing to be uſed; and,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0112200701:32"/>
contrary to the king, his crown, and dignity, thou haſt built a
paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face, that thou haſt men
about thee, who uſually talk of a noun and a verb, and ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
words, as no chriſtian ear can endure to hear.</q> Our dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
poet is generally more attentive to character than to hiſtory;
and I much fear that the art of printing was not introduced into
England, till ſeveral years after Lord Say's death: but of ſome of
theſe meritorious crimes I ſhould hope to find my anceſtor guilty;
and a man of letters may be proud of his deſcent from a patron and
martyr of learning.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the laſt century Robert Gibbon eſq. of Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venden
in Kent, (who died in 1618,) had a ſon of the ſame name of
Robert, who ſettled in London, and became a member of the Cloth-workers'
Company. His wife was a daughter of the Edgars, who
flouriſhed about four hundred years in the county of Suffolk, and
produced an eminent and wealthy ſerjeant-at-law, Sir Gregory Edgar,
in the reign of Henry the Seventh. Of the ſons of Robert Gibbon,
(who died in 1643,) Matthew did not aſpire above the ſtation of a
linen-draper in Leadenhall-ſtreet; but John has given to the public
ſome curious memorials of his exiſtence, his character, and his family.
He was born on the 3d of November in the year 1629; his education
was liberal, at a grammar-ſchool, and afterwards in Jeſus College at
Cambridge; and he celebrates the retired content which he enjoyed
at Alleſborough in Worceſterſhire, in the houſe of Thomas Lord Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,
where John Gibbon was employed as a domeſtic tutor, the
ſame office which Mr. Hobbes exerciſed in the Devonſhire family.
But the ſpirit of my kinſman ſoon immerged into more active life:
he viſited foreign countries as a ſoldier and a traveller, acquired the
knowledge of the French and Spaniſh languages, paſſed ſome time
in the Iſle of Jerſey, croſſed the Atlantic, and reſided upwards of a
twelvemonth (1659) in the riſing colony of Virginia. In this remote
province, his taſte, or rather paſſion, for heraldry found a ſingular
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0112200701:33"/>
gratification at a war-dance of the native Indians. As they moved
in meaſured ſteps, brandiſhing their tomahawks, his curious eye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
their little ſhields of bark, and their naked bodies, which
were painted with the colours and ſymbols of his favourite ſcience.
<q>At which I exceedingly wondered; and concluded that heraldry
was ingrafted <hi>naturally</hi> into the ſenſe of human race. If ſo, it
deſerves a greater eſteem than now-a-days is put upon it.</q> His
return to England after the Reſtoration was ſoon followed by his
marraige—his ſettlement in a houſe in St. Catherine's Cloyſter, near
the Tower, which devolved to my grandfather—and his introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into the Heralds' College (in 1671) by the ſtyle and title of
Blue-mantle Purſuivant at Arms. In this office he enjoyed near fifty
years the rare felicity of uniting, in the ſame purſuit, his duty and
inclination: his name is remembered in the College, and many of
his letters are ſtill preſerved. Several of the moſt reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of the age, Sir William Dugdale, Mr. Aſhmole, Dr. John
Betts, and Dr. Nehemiah Grew, were his friends; and in the ſociety
of ſuch men, John Gibbon may be recorded without diſgrace as the
member of an aſtrological club. The ſtudy of hereditary honours is
favourable to the Royal prerogative; and my kinſman, like moſt of
his family, was a high Tory both in church and ſtate. In the latter
end of the reign of Charles the Second, his pen was exerciſed in the
cauſe of the Duke of York: the Republican faction he moſt cordially
deteſted; and as each animal is conſcious of its proper arms, the
heralds' revenge was emblazoned on a moſt diabolical eſcutcheon.
But the triumph of the Whig government checked the preferment
of Blue-mantle; and he was even ſuſpended from his office, till his
tongue could learn to pronounce the oath of abjuration. His life
was prolonged to the age of ninety; and, in the expectation of the
inevitable though uncertain hour, he wiſhes to preſerve the bleſſings
of health, competence, and virtue. In the year 1682 he publiſhed
at London his <hi>Introductio ad Latinam Blafoniam,</hi> an original attempt,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0112200701:34"/>
which Camden had deſiderated, to define, in a Roman idiom, the
terms and attributes of a Gothic inſtitution. It is not two years
ſince I acquired, in a foreign land, ſome domeſtic intelligence of my
own family; and this intelligence was conveyed to Switzerland from
the heart of Germany. I had formed an acquaintance with Mr.
<hi>Langer,</hi> a lively and ingenious ſcholar, while he reſided at Lauſanne
as preceptor to the Hereditary Prince of <hi>Brunſwick.</hi> On his return
to his proper ſtation of Librarian to the Ducal Library of Wolfen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buttel,
he accidentally found among ſome literary rubbiſh a ſmall old
Engliſh volume of heraldry, inſcribed with the name of <hi>John Gibbon.</hi>
From the title only Mr. <hi>Langer</hi> judged that it might be an acceptable
preſent to his friend; and he judged rightly. His manner is quaint
and affected; his order is confuſed; but he diſplays ſome wit, more
reading, and ſtill more enthuſiaſm; and if an enthuſiaſt be often ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
he is never languid. An Engliſh text is perpetually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
with Latin ſentences in proſe and verſe; but in his own
poetry he claims an exemption from the laws of proſody. Amidſt a
profuſion of genealogical knowledge, my kinſman could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of his own name; and to him I am indebted for almoſt the
whole of my information concerning the Gibbon family. From this
ſmall work (a duodecimo of one hundred and ſixty-five pages) the
author expected immortal fame: and at the concluſion of his labour
he ſings, in a ſtrain of ſelf-exultation;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"Uſque huc corrigitur Romana Blaſonia per me;</l>
               <l>"Verborumque dehinc barbara forma cadat.</l>
               <l>"Hic liber, in meritum ſi forſitan incidet uſum,</l>
               <l>"Testis rite meae ſedulitatis erit.</l>
               <l>"Quicquid agat Zoilus, ventura fatebitur aetas</l>
               <l>"Artis quôd fueram non Clypearis inops."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Such are the hopes of authors! In the failure of thoſe hopes John
Gibbon has not been the firſt of his profeſſion, and very poſſibly
may not be the laſt of his name. His brother Matthew Gibbon, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0112200701:35"/>
draper, had one daughter and two ſons—my grandfather Edward,
who was born in the year 1666, and Thomas, afterwards Dean of
Carliſle. According to the mercantile creed, that the beſt book is a
profitable ledger, the writings of John the herald would be much leſs
precious, than thoſe of his nephew Edward: but an author profeſſes
at leaſt to write for the public benefit; and the ſlow balance of trade
can be pleaſing to thoſe perſons only, to whom it is advantageous.
The ſucceſsful induſtry of my grandfather raiſed him above the level
of his immediate anceſtors; he appears to have launched into various
and extenſive dealings: even his opinions were ſubordinate to his
intereſt; and I find him in Flanders clothing King William's troops,
while he would have contracted with more pleaſure, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
at a cheaper rate, for the ſervice of King James. During his
reſidence abroad, his concerns at home were managed by his mother
Heſter, an active and notable woman. Her ſecond huſband was a
widower, of the name of Acton: they united the children of their
firſt nuptials. After his marriage with the daughter of Richard
Acton, goldſmith in Leadenhall-ſtreet, he gave his own ſiſter to Sir
Whitmore Acton, of Aldenham; and I am thus connected, by a
triple alliance, with that ancient and loyal family of Shropſhire ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets.
It conſiſted about that time of ſeven brothers, all of gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
ſtature; one of whom, a pigmy of ſix feet two inches, confeſſed
himſelf the laſt and leaſt of the ſeven; adding, in the true ſpirit of
party, that ſuch men were not born ſince the Revolution. Under
the Tory adminiſtration of the four laſt years of Queen Anne
(1710—1714) Mr. Edward Gibbon was appointed one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Cuſtoms; he ſat at that Board with Prior: but the
merchant was better qualified for his ſtation than the poet; ſince Lord
Bolingbroke has been heard to declare, that he had never converſed
with a man, who more clearly underſtood the commerce and finances
of England. In the year 1716 he was elected one of the Directors
of the South Sea Company; and his books exhibited the proof that,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0112200701:36"/>
before his acceptance of this fatal office, he had acquired an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
fortune of ſixty thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>But his fortune was overwhelmed in the ſhipwreck of the year
twenty, and the labours of thirty years were blaſted in a ſingle day.
Of the uſe or abuſe of the South Sea ſcheme, of the guilt or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of my grandfather and his brother Directors, I am neither a
competent nor a diſintereſted judge. Yet the equity of modern times
muſt condemn the violent and arbitrary proceedings, which would
have diſgraced the cauſe of juſtice, and would render injuſtice ſtill
more odious. No ſooner had the nation awakened from its golden
dream, than a popular and even a parliamentary clamour demanded
their victims: but it was acknolwedged on all ſides that the South
Sea Directors, however guilty, could not be touched by any known
laws of the lands. The ſpeech of Lord Moleſworth, the author of the
State of Denmark, may ſhew the temper, or rather the intemperance,
of the Houſe of Commons. <q>Extraordinary crimes (exclaimed that
ardent Whig) call aloud for extraordinary remedies. The Roman
lawgivers had not foreſeen the poſſible exiſtence of a parricide:
but as ſoon as the firſt monſter appeared, he was ſown in a ſack, and
caſt headlong into the river; and I ſhall be content to inflict the
ſame treatment on the authors of our preſent ruin.</q> His motion
was not literally adopted; but a bill of pains and penalties was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
a retroactive ſtatute, to puniſh the offences, which did not
exiſt at the time they were committed. Such a pernicious violation
of liberty and law can be excuſed only by the moſt imperious neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;
nor could it be defended on this occaſion by the plea of impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
danger or uſeful example. The legiſlature reſtrained the perſons
of the Directors, impoſed an exorbitant ſecurity for their appearance,
and marked their characters with a previous note of ignominy: they
were compelled to deliver, upon oath, the ſtrict value of their eſtates;
and were diſabled from making any transfer or alienation of any
part of their property. Againſt a bill of pains and penalties it is the

common right of every ſubject to be heard by his counſel at the bar:
they prayed to be heard; their prayer was refuſed; and their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors,
who required no evidence, would liſten to no defence. It
had been at firſt propoſed that one-eighth of their reſpective eſtates
ſhould be allowed for the future ſupport of the Directors; but it was
ſpeciouſly urged, that in the various ſhades of opulence and guilt ſuch
an unequal proportion would be too light for many, and for ſome
might poſſibly be too heavy. The character and conduct of each
man were ſeparately weighed; but, inſtead of the calm ſolemnity of
a judicial inquiry, the fortune and honour of three and thirty Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen
were made the topic of haſty converſation, the ſport of a
lawleſs majority; and the baſeſt member of the committee, by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
word or a ſilent vote, might indulge his general ſpleen or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
animoſity. Injury was aggravated by inſult, and inſult was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered
by pleaſantry. Allowances of twenty pounds, or one ſhilling,
were facetiouſly moved. A vague report that a Director had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been concerned in <hi>another</hi> project, by which ſome unknown
perſons had loſt their money, was admitted as a proof of his actual
guilt. One man was ruined becauſe he had dropt a fooliſh ſpeech, that
his horſes ſhould feed upon gold; another becauſe he was grown ſo
proud, that, one day at the Treaſury, he had refuſed a civil anſwer
to perſons much above him. All were condemned, abſent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
in arbitrary fines and forfeitures, which ſwept away the greateſt
part of their ſubſtance. Such bold oppreſſion can ſcarcely be ſhielded
by the omnipotence of parliament: and yet it may be ſeriouſly
queſtioned, whether the Judges of the South Sea Directors were the
true and legal repreſentatives of their country. The firſt parliament
of George the Firſt had been choſen (1715) for thre years: the
term had elapſed, their truſt was expired; and the four additional
years (1718—1722), during which they continued to ſit, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
not from the people, but from themſelves; from the ſtrong
meaſure of the ſeptennial bill, which can only be paralleled by <hi>il ſerar
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0112200701:38"/>
di conſiglio</hi> of the Venetian hiſtory. Yet candour will own that to the
ſame parliament every Engliſhman is deeply indebted: the ſeptennial
act, ſo vicious in its origin, has been ſanctioned by time, experience,
and the national conſent. Its firſt operation ſecured the Houſe of
Hanover on the throne, and its permanent influence maintains the
peace and ſtability of government. As often as a repeal has been
moved in the Houſe of Commons, I have given in its defence a clear
and conſcientious vote.</p>
            <p>My grandfather could not expect to be treated with more lenity
than his companions. His Tory principles and connections rendered
him obnoxious to the ruling powers: his name is reported in a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
ſecret; and his well-known abilities could not plead the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of ignorance or error. In the firſt proceedings againſt the South
Sea Directors, Mr. Gibbon is one of the few who were taken into
cuſtody; and, in the final ſentence, the meaſure of his fine proclaims
him eminently guilty. The total eſtimate which he delivered on
oath to the Houſe of Commons amounted to one hundred and ſix
thouſand five hundred and forty-three pounds five ſhillings and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
excluſive of antecedent ſettlements. Two different allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of fifteen and of ten thouſand pounds were moved for Mr.
Gibbon; but, on the queſtion being put, it was carried without a
diviſion for the ſmaller ſum. On theſe ruins, with the ſkill and
credit, of which parliament had not been able to deſpoil him, my
grandfather at a mature age erected the edifice of a new fortune:
the labours of ſixteen years were amply rewarded; and I have reaſon
to believe that the ſecond ſtructure was not much inferior to the firſt.
He had realized a very conſiderable property in Suſſex, Hampſhire,
Buckinghamſhire, and the New River Company; and had acquired
a ſpacious houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Since inhabited by Mr. Wood, Sir John Shelley, the Duke of Norfolk, &amp;c. S.</note>, with gardens and lands, at Putney, in Surry,
where he reſided in decent hoſpitality. He died in December 1736,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0112200701:39"/>
at the age of ſeventy; and by his laſt will, at the expence of Edward,
his only ſon, (with whoſe marriage he was not perfectly reconciled,)
enriched his two daughters, Catherine and Heſter. The former became
the wife of Mr. Edward Elliſton, an Eaſt India captain: their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and heireſs Catherine was married in the year 1756 to Edward
Eliot eſq. (now Lord Eliot), of Port Eliot, in the county of Cornwall;
and their three ſons are my neareſt male relations on the father's
ſide. A life of devotion and celibacy was the choice of my aunt, Mrs.
Heſter Gibbon, who, at the age of eighty-five, ſtill reſides in a her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage
at Cliffe, in Northamptonſhire; having long ſurvived her
ſpiritual guide and faithful companion Mr. William Law, who, at
an advanced age, about the year 1761, died in her houſe. In our
family he had left the reputation of a worthy and pious man, who
believed all that he profeſſed, and practiſed all that he enjoined.
The character of a nonjuror, which he maintained to the laſt, is a
ſufficient evidence of his principles in church and ſtate; and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of intereſt to conſicence will be always reſpectable. His the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological
writings, which our domeſtic connection has tempted me to
peruſe, preſerve an imperfect ſort of life, and I can pronounce with
more confidence and knowledge on the merits of the author. His
laſt compoſitions are darkly tinctured by the incomprehenſible viſions
of Jacob Behmen; and his diſcourſe on the abſolute unlawfulneſs of
ſtage-entertainments is ſometimes quoted for a ridiculous intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ſentiment and language.—<q>The actors and ſpectators muſt
all be damned: the playhouſe is the porch of Hell, the place of
the Devil's abode, where he holds his filthy court of evil ſpirits: a
play is the Devil's triumph, a ſacrifice performed to his glory, as much
as in the heathen temples of Bacchus or Venus, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> But
theſe ſallies of religious phrenſy muſt not extinguiſh the praiſe, which
is due to Mr. William Law as a wit and a ſcholar. His argument
on topics of leſs abſurdity is ſpecious and acute, his manner is lively,
his ſtyle forcible and clear; and, had not his vigorous mind been
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0112200701:40"/>
clouded by enthuſiaſm, he might be ranked with the moſt agreeable
and ingenious writers of the times. While the Bangorian controverſy
was a faſhionable theme, he entered the liſts on the ſubject of Chriſt's
kingdom, and the authority of the prieſthood: againſt the plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper he reſumed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
with Biſhop Hoadley, the object of Whig idolatry, and Tory ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence;
and at every weapon of attack and defence the nonjuror,
on the ground which is common to both, approves himſelf at leaſt
equal to the prelate. On the appearance of the Fable of the Bees, he
drew his pen againſt the licentious doctrine that private vices are
public benefits, and morality as well as religion muſt join in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
Mr. Law's maſter-work, the <hi>Serious Call,</hi> is ſtill read as a
popular and powerful book of devotion. His precepts are rigid, but
they are founded on the goſpel: his ſatire is ſharp, but it is drawn
from the knowledge of human life; and many of his portraits are
not unworthy of the pen of La Bruyere. If he finds a ſpark of
piety in his reader's mind, he will ſoon kindle it to a flame; and a
philoſopher muſt allow that he expoſes, with equal ſeverity and truth,
the ſtrange contradiction between the faith and practice of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
world. Under the names of Flavia and Miranda he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
deſcribed my two aunts—the heathen and the chriſtian
ſiſter.</p>
            <p>My father, Edward Gibbon, was born in October 1707: at the
age of thriteen he could ſcarcely feel that he was diſinherited by act
of parliament; and, as he advanced towards manhood, new proſpects
of fortune opened to his view. A parent is moſt attentive to ſupply
in his children the deficiencies, of which he is conſcious in himſelf:
my grandfather's knowledge was derived from a ſtrong under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and the experience of the ways of men; but my father
enjoyed the benefits of a liberal education as a ſcholar and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
At Weſtminſter School, and afterwards at Emanuel College
in Cambridge, he paſſed through a regular courſe of academical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0112200701:41"/>
and the care of his leanring and morals was entruſted to his
private tutor, the ſame Mr. William Law. But the mind of a ſaint
is above or below the preſent world; and while the pupil proceeded
on his travels, the tutor remained at Putney, the much-honoured
friend and ſpiritual director of the whole family. My father reſided
ſome time at Paris to acquire the faſhionable exerciſes; and as his
temper was warm and ſocial, he indulged in thoſe pleaſures, for which
the ſtrictneſs of his former education had given him a keener reliſh.
He afterwards viſited ſeveral provinces of France; but his excurſions
were neither long nor remote; and the ſlender knowledge, which he
had gained of the French language, was gradually obliterated. His
paſſage through Beſançon is marked by a ſingular conſequence in the
chain of human events. In a dangerous illneſs Mr. Gibbon was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
at his own requeſt, by one of his kinſmen of the name of
Acton, the younger brother of a younger brother, who had applied
himſelf to the ſtudy of phyſic. During the ſlow recovery of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
the phyſician himſelf was attacked by the malady of love:
he married his miſtreſs, renounced his country and religion, ſettled at
Beſançon, and became the father of three ſons; the eldeſt of whom,
General Acton, is conſpicuous in Europe as the principal Miniſter of
the King of the Two Sicilies. By an uncle whom another ſtroke of
fortune had tranſplanted to Leghorn, he was educated in the naval
ſervice of the Emperor; and his valour and conduct in the command
of the Tuſcan frigates protected the retreat of the Spaniards from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers.
On my father's return to England he was choſen, in the
general election of 1734, to ſerve in parliament for the borough of
Petersfield; a burgage tenure, of which my grandfather poſſeſſed a
weighty ſhare, till he alienated (I know not why) ſuch important
property. In the oppoſition to Sir Robert Walpole and the Pelhams,
prejudice and ſociety connected his ſon with the Tories,—ſhall I ſay
Jacobites? or, as they were pleaſed to ſtyle themſelves, the country
gentlemen? with them he gave many a vote; with them he drank
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0112200701:42"/>
many a bottle. Without acquiring the fame of an orator or a ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he eagerly joined in the great oppoſition, which, after a ſeven
years chaſe, hunted down Sir Robert Walpole: and in the purſuit of an
unpopular miniſter, he gratified a private revenge againſt the oppreſſor
of his family in the South Sea perſecution.</p>
            <p>I was born at Putney, in the county of Surry, the 27th of April,
O. S. in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty-ſeven; the
firſt child of the marriage of Edward Gibbon eſq. and of Judith
Porten<note n="*" place="bottom">The union to which I owe my birth was a marriage of inclination and eſteem. Mr. James Porten, a merchant of London, reſided with his family at Putney, in a houſe adjoining to the bridge and church-yard, where I have paſſed many happy hours of my childhood. He left one ſon (the late Sir Stanier Porten) and three daughters: Catherine, who preſerved her maiden name, and of whom I ſhall hereafter ſpeak; another daughter married Mr. Darrel of Richmond, and left two ſons, Edward and Robert: the youngeſt of the three ſiſters was Judith, my mother.</note>. My lot might have been that of a ſlave, a ſavage, or a
peaſant; nor can I reflect without pleaſure on the bounty of Nature,
which caſt my birth in a free and civilized country, in an age of
ſcience and philoſophy, in a family of honourable rank, and decently
endowed with the gifts of fortune. From my birth I have enjoyed
the right of primogeniture; but I was ſucceeded by five brothers and
one ſiſter, all of whom were ſnatched away in their infancy. My
five brothers, whoſe names may be found in the pariſh regiſter of
Putney, I ſhall not pretend to lament: but from my childhood to
the preſent hour I have deeply and ſincerely regretted my ſiſter,
whoſe life was ſomewhat prolonged, and whom I remember to have
ſeen an amiable infant. The relation of a brother and a ſiſter, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they do not marry, appears to me of a very ſingular nature.
It is a familiar and tender friendſhip with a female, much about
our own age; an affection perhaps ſoftened by the ſecret influence
of ſex, but pure from any mixture of ſenſual deſire, the ſole ſpecies
of Platonic love that can be indulged with truth, and without
danger.</p>

At the general election of 1741, Mr. Gibbon and Mr. Delmé ſtood
an expenſive and ſucceſsful conteſt at Southampton, againſt Mr. Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and Mr. Henly, afterwards Lord Chancellor and Earl of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington.
The Whig candidates had a majority of the reſident voters;
but the corporation was firm in the Tory intereſt: a ſudden creation
of one hundred and ſeventy new freemen turned the ſcale; and a
ſupply was readily obtained of reſpectable volunteers, who flocked
from all parts of England to ſupport the cauſe of their political friends.
The new parliament opened with the victory of an oppoſition, which
was fortified by ſtrong clamour and ſtrange coalitions. From the
event of the firſt diviſions, Sir Robert Walpole perceived that he
could no longer lead a majority in the Houſe of Commons, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
reſigned (after a dominion of one and twenty years) the
guidance of the ſtate (1742). But the fall of an unpopular miniſter
was not ſucceeded, according to general expectation, by a millenium
of happineſs and virtue: ſome courtiers loſt their places, ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
loſt their characters, Lord Orford's offences vaniſhed with his
power; and after a ſhort vibration, the Pelham government was fixed
on the old baſis of the Whig ariſtocracy. In the year 1745, the
throne and the conſtitution were attacked by a rebellion, which does
not reflect much honour on the national ſpirit: ſince the Engliſh
friends of the Pretender wanted courage to join his ſtandard, and his
enemies (the bulk of the people) allowed him to advance into the
heart of the kingdom. Without daring, perhaps without deſiring,
to aid the rebels, my father invariably adhered to the Tory oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the moſt critical ſeaſon he accepted, for the ſervice of the
party, the office of alderman in the city of London: but the duties
were ſo repugnant to his inclination and habits, that he reſigned his
gown at the end of a few months. The ſecond parliament in which
he ſat was prematurely diſſolved (1747): and as he was unable or
unwilling to maintain a ſecond conteſt for Southampton, the life of
the ſenator expired in that diſſolution.</p>

The death of a new-born child before that of its parents may ſeem
an unnatural, but it is ſtrictly a probable, event: ſince of any given
number the greater part are extinguiſhed before their ninth year,
before they poſſeſs the faculties of the mind or body. Without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
the profuſe waſte or imperfect workmanſhiop of Nature, I ſhall
only obſerve, that this unfavourable chance was multiplied againſt my
infant exiſtence. So feeble was my conſtitution, ſo precarious my
life, that, in the baptiſm of each of my brothers, my father's pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſucceſſively repeated my chriſtian name of Edward, that, in
caſe of the departure of the eldeſt ſon, this patronymick appellation
might be ſtill perpetuated in the family.
<q>—Uno avulſo non deficit alter.</q>
To preſerve and to rear ſo frail a being, the moſt tender aſſiduity was
ſcarcely ſufficient; and my mother's attention was ſomewhat diverted
by her frequent pregnancies, by an excluſive paſſion for her huſband,
and by the diſſipation of the world, in which his taſte and authority
obliged her to mingle. But the maternal office was ſupplied by my
aunt, Mrs. Catherine Porten; at whoſe name I feel a tear of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
trickling down my cheek. A life of celibacy transferred her
vacant affection to her ſiſter's firſt child: my weakneſs excited her
pity; her attachment was fortified by labour and ſucceſs: and if there
be any, as I truſt there are ſome, who rejoice that I live, to that
dear and excellent woman they muſt hold themſelves indebted.
Many anxious and ſolitary days did ſhe conſume in the patient trial
of every mode of relief and amuſement. Many wakeful nights did
ſhe ſit by my bed-ſide in trembling expectation that each hour would
be my laſt. Of the various and frequent diſorders of my childhood
my own recollection is dark; nor do I wiſh to expatiate on ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting
a topic. Suffice it to ſay, that while every practitioner, from
Sloane and Ward to the Chevalier Taylor, was ſucceſſively ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to torture or relieve me, the care of my mind was too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
neglected for that of my health: compaſſion always ſuggeſted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0112200701:45"/>
an excuſe for the indulgence of the maſter, or the idleneſs of the
pupil; and the chain of my education was broken, as often as I was
recalled from the ſchool of learning to the bed of ſickneſs.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the uſe of ſpeech had prepared my infant reaſon for the
admiſſion of knowledge, I was taught the arts of reading, writing,
and arithmetic. So remote is the date, ſo vague is the memory of
their origin in myſelf, that, were not the error corrected by analogy,
I ſhould be tempted to conceive them as innate. In my childhood
I was praiſed for the readineſs, with which I could multiply and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
by memory alone, two ſums of ſeveral figures: ſuch praiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
my growing talent; and had I perſevered in this line of
application, I might have acquired ſome fame in mathematical
ſtudies.</p>
            <p>After this previous inſtitution at home, or at a day-ſchool at Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
I was delivered at the age of ſeven into the hands of Mr. John
Kirkby, who exerciſed about eighteen months the office of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
tutor. His own words, which I ſhall here tranſcribe, inſpire
in his favour a ſentiment of pity and eſteem.—<q>During my abode
in my native county of Cumberland, in quality of an indigent
curate, I uſed now-and-then in a Summer, when the pleaſantneſs
of the ſeaſon invited, to take a ſolitary walk to the ſea-ſhore, which
lies about two miles from the town where I lived. Here I would
amuſe myſelf, one while in viewing at large the agreeable proſpect
which ſurrounded me, and another while (confining my ſight to
nearer objects) in admiring the vaſt variety of beautiful ſhells, thrown
upon the beach; ſome of the choiceſt of which I always picked up,
to divert my little ones upon my return. One time among the
reſt, taking ſuch a journey in my head, I ſat down upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
of the beach with my face to the ſea, which was now come
up within a few yards of my feet; when immediately the ſad
thoughts of the wretched condition of my family, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs
of all endeavours to amend it, came crowding into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0112200701:46"/>
my mind, which drove me into a deep melancholy, and ever and
anon forced tears from my eyes.</q> Diſtreſs at laſt forced him to
leave the country. His learning and virtue introduced him to my
father; and at Putney he might have found at leaſt a temporary
ſhelter, had not an act of indiſcretion again driven him into the
world. One day reading prayers in the pariſh church, he moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
forgot the name of King George: his patron, a loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
diſmiſſed him with ſome reluctance, and a decent reward; and
<hi>how</hi> the poor man ended his days I have never been able to learn.
Mr. John Kirkby is the author of two ſmall volumes; the Life of
Automathes (London, 1745), and an Engliſh and Latin Grammar
(London, 1746); which, as a teſtimony of gratitude, he dedicated
(November 5th, 1745) to my father. The books are before me:
from them the pupil may judge the preceptor; and, upon the whole,
his judgment will not be unfavourable. The grammar is executed
with accuracy and ſkill, and I know not whether any better exiſted
at the time in our language: but the life of Automathes aſpires to
the honours of a philoſophical fiction. It is the ſtory of a youth, the
ſon of a ſhipwrecked exile, who lives alone on a deſert iſland from
infancy to the age of manhood. A hind is his nurſe; he inherits a
cottage, with many uſeful and curious inſtruments; ſome ideas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
of the education of his two firſt years; ſome arts are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the beavers of a neighbouring lake; ſome truths are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in ſupernatural viſions. With theſe helps, and his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
Automathes becomes a ſelf-taught thought ſpeechleſs philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
who had inveſtigated with ſucceſs his own mind, the natural
world, the abſtract ſciences, and the great principles of morality and
religion. The author is not entitled to the merit of invention, ſince
he has blended the Engliſh ſtory of Robinſon Cruſoe with the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
romance of Hai Ebn Yokhdan, which he might have read in the
Latin verſion of Pocock. In the Automathes I cannot praiſe either
the depth of thought or elegance of ſtyle; but the book is not devoid
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0112200701:47"/>
of entertainment or inſtruction; and among ſeveral intereſting paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
I would ſelect the diſcovery of fire, which produces by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
miſchief the diſcovery of conſcience. A man who had though
ſo much on the ſubjects of language and education was ſurely no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
preceptor: my childiſh years, and his haſty departure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
me from enjoying the full benefit of his leſſons; but they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
my knowledge of arithmetic, and left me a clear impreſſion of
the Engliſh and Latin rudiments.</p>
            <p>In my ninth year (January 1746), in a lucid interval of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
health, my father adopted the convenient and cuſtomary mode
of Engliſh education; and I was ſent to Kingſton upon Thames, to
a ſchool of about ſeventy boys, which was kept by Dr. Wooddeſon
and his aſſiſtants. Every time I have ſince paſſed over Putney Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
I have always noticed the ſpot where my mother, as we drove
along in the coach, admoniſhed me that I was now going into the
world, and muſt learn to think and act for myſelf. The expreſſion
may appear ludicrous; yet there is not, in the courſe of life, a more
remarkable change than the removal of a child from the luxury and
freedom of a wealthy houſe, to the frugal diet and ſtrict ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſchool; from the tenderneſs of parents, and the obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſervants, to the rude familiarity of his equals, the inſolent ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of his ſeniors, and the rod, perhaps, of a cruel and capricious
pedagogue. Such hardſhips may ſteel the mind and body againſt the
injuries of fortune; but my timid reſerve was aſtoniſhed by the
crowd and tumult of the ſchool; the want of ſtrength and activity
diſqualified me for the ſports of the play-field; nor have I forgotten
how often in the year forty-ſix I was reviled and buffetted for the
ſins of my Tory anceſtors. By the common methods of diſcipline,
at the expence of many tears and ſome blood, I purchaſed the
knowledge of the Latin ſyntax: and not long ſince I was poſſeſſed
of the dirty volumes of Phaedrus and Cornelius Nepos, which I pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
conſtrued and darkly underſtood. The choice of theſe authors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0112200701:48"/>
is not injudicious. The <hi>lives</hi> of Cornelius Nepos, the friend of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus
and Cicero, are compoſed in the ſtyle of the pureſt age: his
ſimplicity is elegant, his brevity copious: he exhibits a ſeries of men
and manners; and with ſuch illuſtrations, as every pedant is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
qualified to give, this claſſic biographer may initiate a young
ſtudent in the hiſtory of Greece and Rome. The uſe of fables or
apologues has been approved in every age from antient India to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Europe. They convey in familiar images the truths of morality
and prudence; and the moſt childiſh underſtanding (I advert to the
ſcruples of Rouſſeau) will not ſuppoſe either that beaſts <hi>do</hi> ſpeak, or
that men <hi>may</hi> lie. A fable repreſents the genuine characters of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
and ſkilful maſter might extract from Pliny and Buffon ſome
pleaſing leſſons of natural hiſtory, a ſcience well adapted to the taſte
and capacity of children. The Latinity of Phaedrus is not exempt
from an alloy of the ſilver age; but his manner is conciſe, terſe, and
ſententious: the Thracian ſlave diſcreetly breathes the ſpirit of a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and when the text is found, the ſtyle is perſpicuous. But his
fables, after a long oblivion, were firſt publiſhed by Peter Pithou,
from a corrupt manuſcript. The labours of fifty editors confeſs the
defects of the copy, as well as the value of the original; and the
ſchool-boy may have been whipt for miſapprehending a paſſage,
which Bentley could not reſtore, and which Burman could not
explain.</p>
            <p>My ſtudies were too frequently interrupted by ſickneſs; and after
a real or nominal reſidence at Kingſton-ſchool of near two years, I
was finally recalled (December 1747) by my mother's death, which
was occaſioned, in her thirty-eighth year, by the conſequences of
her laſt labour. I was too young to feel the importance of my loſs;
and the image of her perſon and converſation is faintly imprinted in
my memory. The affectionate heart of my aunt, Catherine Porten,
bewailed a ſiſter and a friend; but my poor father was inconſolable,
and the tranſport of grief ſeemed to threaten his life or his reaſon.

I can never forget the ſeene of our firſt interview, ſome weeks after
the fatal event; the awful ſilence, the room hung with black, the
mid-day tapers, his ſighs and tears; his praiſes of my mother, a ſaint
in heaven; his ſolemn adjuration that I would cheriſh her memory
and imitate her virtues; and the fervor with which he kiſſed and
bleſſed me as the ſole ſurviving pledge of their loves. The ſtorm of
paſſion inſenſibly ſubſided into calmer melancholy. At a convivial
meeting of his friends, Mr. Gibbon might affect or enjoy a gleam of
cheerfulneſs; but his plan of happineſs was for ever deſtroyed: and
after the loſs of his companion he was left alone in a world, of which
the buſineſs and pleaſures were to him irkſome or inſipid. After
ſome unſucceſsful trials he renounced the tumult of London and the
hoſpitality of Putney, and buried himſelf in the rural or rather ruſtic
ſolitude of Buriton; from which, during ſeveral years, he ſeldom
emerged.</p>
            <p>As far back as I can remember, the houſe, near Putney-bridge and
church-yard, of my maternal grandfather appears in the light of my
prper and native home. It was there that I was allowed to ſpend
the greateſt part of my time, in ſickneſs or in health, during my
ſchool vacations and my parents' reſidence in London, and finally
after my mother's death. Three months after that event, in the
ſpring of 1748, the commercial ruin of her father, Mr. James Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
was accompliſhed and declared. He ſuddenly abſconded: but as
his effects were not ſold, nor the houſe evacuated, till the Chriſtmas
following, I enjoyed during the whole year the ſociety of my aunt,
without much conſciouſneſs of her impending fate. I feel a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
pleaſure in repeating my obligations to that excellent woman,
Mrs. Catherine Porten, the true mother of my mind as well as of
my health. Her natural good ſenſe was improved by the peruſal of
the beſt books in the Engliſh language; and if her reaſon was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
clouded by prejudice, her ſentiments were never diſguiſed by
hypocriſy or affectation. Her indulgent tenderneſs, the frankneſs of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0112200701:50"/>
her temper, and my innate riſing curioſity, ſoon removed all diſtance
between us: like friends of an equal age, we freely converſed on
every topic, familiar or abſtruſe; and it was her delight and reward
to obſerve the firſt ſhoots of my young ideas. Pain and languor
were often ſoothed by the voice of inſtruction and amuſement; and
to her kind leſſons I aſcribe my early and invincible love of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which I would not exchange for the treaſures of India. I
ſhould perhaps be aſtoniſhed, were it poſſible to aſcertain the date, at
which a favourite tale was engraved, by frequent repetition, in my
memory: the Cavern of the Winds; the Palace of Felicity; and the
fatal moment, at the end of three months or centuries, when Prince
Adolphus is overtaken by Time, who had worn out ſo many pair of
wings in the purſuit. Before I left Kingſton ſchool I was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Pope's Homer and the Arabian Nights Entertainments,
two books which will always pleaſe by the moving picture of human
manners and ſpecious miracles: nor was I then capable of diſcerning
that Pope's tranſlation is a portrait endowed with every merit, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that of likeneſs to the original. The verſes of Pope accuſtomed my
ear to the ſound of poetic harmony: in the death of Hector, and the
ſhipwreck of Ulyſſes, I taſted the new emotions of terror and pity; and
ſeriouſly diſputed with my aunt on the vices and virtues of the heroes
of the Trojan war. From Pope's Homer to Dryden's Virgil was an
eaſy tranſition; but I know not how, from ſome fault in the author,
the tranſlator, or the reader, the pious Aeneas did not ſo forcibly
ſeize on my imagination; and I derived more pleaſure from Ovid's
Metamorphoſes, eſpecially in the fall of Phaeton, and the ſpeeches of
Ajax and Ulyſſes. My grandfather's flight unlocked the door of a
tolerable library; and I turned over many Engliſh pages of poetry
and romance, of hiſtory and travels. Where a title attracted my eye,
without fear or awe I ſnatched the volume from the ſhelf; and Mrs.
Porten, who indulged herſelf in moral and religious ſpeculations,
was more prone to encourage than to check a curioſity above the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0112200701:51"/>
ſtrength of a boy. This year (1748), the twelfth of my age, I ſhall
note as the moſt propitious to the growth of my intellectual ſtatue.</p>
            <p>The relies of my grandfather's fortune afforded a bare annuity for
his own maintenance; and his daughter, my worthy aunt, who had
already paſſed her fortieth year, was left deſtitute. Her noble ſpirit
ſcorned a life of obligation and dependence; and after revolving ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſchemes, ſhe preferred the humble induſtry of keeping a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe
for Weſtminſter-ſchool<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid in the family, that ſhe was principally induced to this undertaking by her affection for her nephew, whoſe weak conſtitution required her conſtant and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted attention. S.</note>, where ſhe laboriouſly earned a
competence for her old age. This ſingular opportunity of blending
the advantages of private and public education decided my father.
After the Chriſtmas holidays in January 1749, I accompanied Mrs.
Porten to her new houſe in College-ſtreet; and was immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in the ſchool, of which Dr. John Nicoll was at that time head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.
At firſt I was alone: but my aunt's reſolution was praiſed;
her character was eſteemed; her friends were numerous and active:
in the courſe of ſome years ſhe became the mother of forty or fifty
boys, for the moſt part of family and fortune; and as her primitive
habitation was too narrow, ſhe built and occupied a ſpacious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in Dean's Yard. I ſhall always be ready to join in the common
opinion, that our public ſchools, which have produced ſo many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
characters, are the beſt adapted to the genius and conſtitution
of the Engliſh people. A boy of ſpirit may acquire a previous and
practical experience of the world; and his playfellows may be the
future friends of his heart or his intereſt. In a free intercourſe with
his equals, the habits of truth, fortitude, and prudence will inſenſibly
be matured. Birth and riches are meaſured by the ſtandard of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
merit; and the mimic ſcene of a rebellion has diſplayed, in
their true colours, the miniſters and patriots of the riſing generation.
Our ſeminaries of learning do not exactly correſpond with the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0112200701:52"/>
precept of a Spartan king, <q>that the child ſhould be inſtructed in the
arts, which will be uſeful to the man;</q> ſince a finiſhed ſcholar may
emerge from the head of Weſtminſter or Eton, in total ignorance of
the buſineſs and converſation of Engliſh gentlemen in the latter end
of the eighteenth century. But theſe ſchools may aſſume the merit
of teaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:
they depoſit in the hands of a diſciple the keys of two valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
cheſts; nor can he complain, if they are afterwards loſt or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
by his own fault. The neceſſity of leading in equal ranks ſo
many unequal powers of capacity and application, will prolong to
eight or ten years the juvenile ſtudies, which might be diſpatched in
half that time by the ſkilful maſter of a ſingle pupil. Yet even the
repetition of exerciſe and diſcipline contributes to fix in a vacant
mind the verbal ſcience of grammar and proſody: and the private or
voluntary ſtudent, who poſſeſſes the ſenſe and ſpirit of the claſſics, may
offend, by a falſe quantity, the ſcrupulous ear of a well-flogged critic.
For myſelf, I muſt be content with a very ſmall ſhare of the civil and
literary fruits of a public ſchool. In the ſpace of two years (1749,
1750), interrupted by danger and debility, I painfully climbed into
the third form; and my riper age was left to acquire the beauties of
the Latin, and the rudiments of the Greek tongue. Inſtead of auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
mingling in the ſports, the quarrels, and the connections of
our little world, I was ſtill cheriſhed at home under the maternal
wing of my aunt; and my removal from Weſtminſter long preceded
the approach of manhood.</p>
            <p>The violence and variety of my complaints, which had excuſed
my frequent abſence from Weſtminſter-ſchool, at length engaged
Mrs. Porten, with the advice of phyſicians, to conduct me to Bath:
at the end of the Michaelmas vacation (1750) ſhe quitted me with
reluctance, and I remained ſeveral months under the care of a truſty
maid-ſervant. A ſtrange nervous affection, which alternately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
my legs, and produced, without any viſible ſymptoms, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0112200701:53"/>
moſt excruciating pain, was ineffectually oppoſed by the various
methods of bathing and pumping. From Bath I was tranſported to
Wincheſter, to the houſe of a phyſician; and after the failure of his
medical ſkill, we had again recourſe to the virtues of the Bath waters.
During the intervals of theſe fits, I moved with my father to Buriton
and Putney; and a ſhort unſucceſsful trial was attempted to renew
my attendance at Weſtminſter-ſchool. But my infirmities could not
be reconciled with the hours and diſcipline of a public ſeminary; and
inſtead of a domeſtic tutor, who might have watched the favourable
moments, and gently advanced the progreſs of my learning, my
father was too eaſily content with ſuch occaſional teachers, as the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
places of my reſidence could ſupply. I was never forced, and
ſeldom was I perſuaded, to admit theſe leſſons: yet I read with a
clergyman at Bath ſome odes of Horace, and ſeveral epiſodes of
Virgil, which gave me an imperfect and tranſient enjoyment of the
Latin poets. It might now be apprehended that I ſhould continue
for life an illiterate cripple: but, as I approached my ſixteenth year,
Nature diſplayed in my favour her myſterious energies: my conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
was fortified and fixed; and my diſorders, inſtead of growing
with my growth and ſtrengthening with my ſtrength, moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vaniſhed. I have never poſſeſſed or abuſed the inſolence of
health: but ſince that time few perſons have been more exempt from
real or imaginary ills; and, till I am admoniſhed by the gout, the
reader will no more be troubled with the hiſtory of my bodily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
My unexpected recovery again encouraged the hope of my
education; and I was placed at Eſher, in Surry, in the houſe of the
Reverend Mr. Philip Francis, in a pleaſant ſpot, which promiſed to
unite the various benefits of air, exerciſe, and ſtudy (January 1752).
The tranſlator of Horace might have taught me to reliſh the Latin
poets, had not my friends diſcovered in a few weeks, that he preferred
the pleaſures of London, to the inſtruction of his pupils. My father's
perplexity at this time, rather than his prudence, was urged to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0112200701:54"/>
a ſingular and deſperate meaſure. Without preparation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
he carried me to Oxford; and I was matriculated in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
as a gentleman commoner of Magdalen college, before I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
the fifteenth year of my age (April 3, 1752).</p>
            <p>The curioſity, which had been implanted in my infant mind, was
ſtill alive and active; but my reaſon was not ſufficiently informed to
underſtand the value, or to lament the loſs, of three precious years
from my entrance at Weſtminſter to my admiſſion at Oxford. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of repining at my long and frequent confinement to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or the couch, I ſecretly rejoiced in thoſe infirmities, which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
me from the exerciſes of the ſchool, and the ſociety of my
equals. As often as I was tolerably exempt from danger and pain,
reading, free deſultory reading, was the employment and comfort of
my ſolitary hours. At Weſtminſter, my aunt ſought only to amuſe
and indulge me; in my ſtations at Bath and Wincheſter, at Buriton
and Putney, a falſe compaſſion reſpected my ſufferings; and I was
allowed, without controul or advice, to gratify the wanderings of an
unripe taſte. My indiſcriminate appetite ſubſided by degrees in the
<hi>hiſtoric</hi> line: and ſince philoſophy has exploded all innate ideas
and natural propenſities, I muſt aſcribe this choice to the aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
peruſal of the Univerſal Hiſtory, as the octavo volumes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
appeared. This unequal work, and a treatiſe of Hearne, the
<hi>Ductor hiſtoricus,</hi> referred and introduced me to the Greek and Roman
hiſtorians, to as many at leaſt as were acceſſible to an Engliſh reader.
All that I could find were greedily devoured, from Littlebury's lame
Herodotus, and Spelman's valuable Xenophon, to the pompous
folios of Gordon's Tacitus, and a ragged Procopius of the beginning
of the laſt century. The cheap acquiſition of ſo much knowledge
confirmed my diſlike to the ſtudy of languages; and I argued with
Mrs. Porten, that, were I maſter of Greek and Latin, I muſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
to myſelf in Engliſh the thoughts of the original, and that ſuch
extemporary verſions muſt be inferior to the elaborate tranſlations of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0112200701:55"/>
profeſſed ſcholars; a ſilly ſophiſm, which could not eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by a perſon ignorant of any other language than her own.
From the ancient I leaped to the modern world: many crude lumps
of Speed, Rapin, Mezeray, Davila, Machiavel, Father Paul, Bower,
&amp;c. I devoured like ſo many novels; and I ſwallowed with the ſame
voracious appetite the deſcriptions of India and China, of Mexico
and Peru.</p>
            <p>My firſt introduction to the hiſtoric ſcenes, which have ſince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
ſo many years of my life, muſt be aſcribed to an accident. In
the ſummer of 1751, I accompanied my father on a viſit to Mr.
Hoare's, in Wiltſhire; but I was leſs delighted with the beauties of
Stourhead, than with diſcovering in the library a common book,
the Continuation of Echard's Roman Hiſtory, which is indeed exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
with more ſkill and taſte than the previous work. To me
the reigns of the ſucceſſors of Conſtantine were abſolutely new;
and I was immerſed in the paſſage of the Goths over the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,
when the ſummons of the dinner-bell reluctantly dragged me
from my intellectual feaſt. This tranſient glance ſerved rather to
irritate than to appeaſe my curioſity; and as ſoon as I returned to
Bath I procured the ſecond and third volumes of Howel's Hiſtory of
the World, which exhibit the Byzantine period on a larger ſcale.
Mahomet and his Saracens ſoon fixed my attention; and ſome inſtinct
of criticiſm directed me to the genuine ſources. Simon Ockley, an
original in every ſenſe, firſt opened my eyes; and I was led from
one book to another, till I had ranged round the circle of Oriental
hiſtory. Before I was ſixteen, I had exhauſted all that could be
learned in Engliſh of the Arabs and Perſians, the Tartars and Turks;
and the ſame ardour urged me to gueſs at the French of D'Herbelot,
and to conſtrue the barbarous Latin of Pocock's Abulfaragius. Such
vague and multifarious reading could not teach me to think, to write,
or to act; and the only principle, that darted a ray of light into the
indigeſted chaos, was an early and rational application to the order
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0112200701:56"/>
of time and place. The maps of Cellarius and Wells imprinted in my
mind the picture of ancient geography: from Stranchius I imbibed
the elements of chronology: the Tables of Helvicus and Anderſon,
the Annals of Uſher and Prideaux, diſtinguiſhed the connection of
events, and engraved the multitude of names and dates in a clear and
indelible ſeries. But in the diſcuſſion of the firſt ages I overleaped
the bounds of modeſty and uſe. In my childiſh balance I preſumed
to weigh the ſyſtems of Scaliger and Petavius, of Marſham and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
which I could ſeldom ſtudy in the originals; and my ſleep has
been diſturbed by the difficulty of reconciling the Septuagint with the
Hebrew computation. I arrived at Oxford with a ſtock of erudition,
that might have puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance, of which
a ſchool-boy would have been aſhamed.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of this firſt period of my life, I am tempted to
enter a proteſt againſt the trite and laviſh praiſe of the happineſs of
our boyiſh years, which is echoed with ſo much affectation in the
world. That happineſs I have never known, that time I have never
regretted; and were my poor aunt ſtill alive, ſhe would bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the early and conſtant uniformity of my ſentiments. It will
indeed be replied, that <hi>I</hi> am not a competent judge; that pleaſure is
incompatible with pain; that joy is excluded from ſickneſs; and that
the felicity of a ſchool-boy conſiſts in the perpetual motion of
thoughtleſs and playful agility, in which I was never qualified to
excel. My name, it is moſt true, could never be enrolled among
the ſprightly race, the idle progeny of Eton or Weſtminſter,
<q>
                  <l>"Who foremoſt may delight to cleave,</l>
                  <l>"With pliant arm, the glaſſy wave,</l>
                  <l>"Or urge the flying ball."</l>
               </q>
The poet may gaily deſcribe the ſhort hours of recreation; but he
forgets the daily tedious labours of the ſchool, which is approached
each morning with anxious and reluctant ſteps.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0112200701:57"/>
A traveller, who viſits Oxford or Cambridge, is ſurpriſed and edified
by the apparent order and tranquillity that prevail in the ſeats of the
Engliſh muſes. In the moſt celebrated univerſities of Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
and Italy, the ſtudents, who ſwarm from different countries,
are looſely diſperſed in private lodgings at the houſes of the burghers:
they dreſs according to their fancy and fortune; and in the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
quarrels of youth and wine, their <hi>ſwords,</hi> though leſs frequently
than of old, are ſometimes ſtained with each other's blood. The uſe
of arms is baniſhed from our Engliſh univerſities; the uniform habit
of the academics, the ſquare cap, and black gown, is adapted to the
civil and even clerical profeſſion; and from the doctor in divinity to
the under-graduate, the degrees of learning and age are externally
diſtinguiſhed. Inſtead of being ſcattered in a town, the ſtudents of
Oxford and Cambridge are united in colleges; their maintenance is
provided at their own expence, or that of the founders; and the
ſtated hours of the hall and chapel repreſent the diſcipline of a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and, as it were, a religious community. The eyes of the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
are attracted by the ſize or beauty of the public edifices; and the
principal colleges appear to be ſo many palaces, which a liberal nation
has erected and endowed for the habitation of ſcience. My own
introduction to the univerſity of Oxford forms a new aera in my life;
and at the diſtance of forty years I ſtill remember my firſt emotions
of ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction. In my fifteenth year I felt myſelf ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
raiſed from a boy to a man: the perſons, whom I reſpected as my
ſuperiors in age and academical rank, entertained me with every mark
of attention and civility; and my vanity was flattered by the velvet
cap and ſilk gown, which diſtinguiſh a gentleman commoner from a
plebeian ſtudent. A decent allowance, more money than a ſchool-boy
had ever ſeen, was at my own diſpoſal; and I might command,
among the tradeſmen of Oxford, an indefinite and dangerous lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of credit. A key was delivered into my hands, which gave me
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0112200701:58"/>
the free uſe of a numerous and learned library: my apartment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of three elegant and well-furniſhed rooms in the new building,
a ſtately pile, of Magdalen College; and the adjacent walks, had
they been frequented by Plato's diſciples, might have been compared
to the Attic ſhade on the banks of the Iliſſus. Such was the fair
proſpect of my entrance (April 3, 1752) into the univerſity of
Oxford.</p>
            <p>A venerable prelate, whoſe taſte and erudition muſt reflect honour
on the ſociety in which they were formed, has drawn a very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
picture of his academical life.—<q>I was educated (ſays Biſhop
Lowth) in the UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. I enjoyed all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
both public and private, which that famous ſeat of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo largely affords. I ſpent many years in that illuſtrious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
in a well-regulated courſe of uſeful diſcipline and ſtudies, and
in the agreeable and improving commerce of gentlemen and of
ſcholars; in a ſociety where emulation without envy, ambition
without jealouſy, contention without animoſity, incited induſtry,
and awakened genius; where a liberal purſuit of knowledge, and
a genuine freedom of thought, was raiſed, encouraged, and puſhed
forward by example, by commendation, and by authority. I
breathed the ſame atmoſphere that the HOOKERS, the CHILLING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTHS,
and the LOCKES had breathed before; whoſe benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and humanity were as extenſive as their vaſt genius and
comprehenſive knowledge; who always treated their adverſaries
with civility and reſpect; who made candour, moderation, and
liberal judgment as much the rule and law as the ſubject of their
diſcourſe. And do you reproach me with my education in this
place, and with my relation to this moſt reſpectable body, which
I ſhall always eſteem my greateſt advantage and my higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</q> I tranſcribe with pleaſure this eloquent paſſage, without
examining what benefits or what rewards were derived by Hooker,
or Chillingworth, or Locke, from their academical inſtitution; without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0112200701:59"/>
inquiring, whether in this angry controverſy the ſpirit of Lowth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is purified from the intolerant zeal, which Warburton had aſcribed
to the genius of the place. It may indeed be obſerved, that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere
of Oxford did not agree with Mr. Locke's conſtitution, and
that the philoſopher juſtly deſpiſed the academical bigots, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
his perſon and condemned his principles. The expreſſion of
gratitude is a virtue and a pleaſure: a liberal mind will delight to
cheriſh and celebrate the memory of its parents; and the teachers of
ſcience are the parents of the mind. I applaud the filial piety, which
it is impoſſible for me to imitate; ſince I muſt not confeſs an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
debt, to aſſume the merit of a juſt or generous retribution. To
the univerſity of Oxford <hi>I</hi> acknowledge no obligation; and ſhe will
as cheerfully renounce me for a ſon, as I am willing to diſclaim her
for a mother. I ſpent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they
proved the fourteen months the moſt idle and unprofitable of my
whole life: the reader will pronounce between the ſchool and the
ſcholar; but I cannot affect to believe that Nature had diſqualified me
for all literary purſuits. The ſpecious and ready excuſe of my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
age, imperfect preparation, and haſty departure, may doubtleſs
be alleged; nor do I wiſh to defraud ſuch excuſes of their proper
weight. Yet in my ſixteenth year I was not devoid of capacity or
application; even my childiſh reading had diſplayed an early though
blind propenſity for books; and the ſhallow flood might have been
taught to flow in a deep channel and a clear ſtream. In the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of a well-conſtituted academy, under the guidance of ſkilful
and vigilant profeſſors, I ſhould gradually have riſen from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to originals, from the Latin to the Greek claſſics, from
dead languages to living ſcience: my hours would have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
by uſeful and agreeable ſtudies, the wanderings of fancy
would have been reſtrained, and I ſhould have eſcaped the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of idleneſs, which finally precipitated my departure from
Oxford.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0112200701:60"/>
Perhaps in a ſeparate annotation I may coolly examine the fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and real antiquities of our ſiſter univerſities, a queſtion which
has kindled ſuch fierce and fooliſh diſputes among their fanatic ſons.
In the mean while it will be acknolwedged, that theſe venerable
bodies are ſufficiently old to partake of all the prejudices and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of age. The ſchools of Oxford and Cambridge were founded in
a dark age of falſe and barbarous ſcience; and they are ſtill tainted
with the vices of their origin. Their primitive diſcipline was adapted
to the education of prieſts and monks; and the government ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the hands of the clergy, an order of men whoſe manners
are remote from the preſent world, and whoſe eyes are dazzled by
the light of philoſophy. The legal incorporation of theſe ſocieties
by the charters of popes and kings had given them a monopoly of
the public inſtruction; and the ſpirit of monopoliſts is narrow,
lazy, and oppreſſive: their work is more coſtly and leſs productive
than that of independent artiſts; and the new improvements ſo
eagerly graſped by the competition of freedom, are admitted with
ſlow and ſullen reluctance in thoſe proud corporations, above the fear
of a rival, and below the confeſſion of an error. We may ſcarcely
hope that any reformation will be a voluntary act; and ſo deeply are
they rooted in law and prejudice, that even the omnipotence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would ſhrink from an inquiry into the ſtate and abuſes of
the two univerſities.</p>
            <p>The uſe of academical degrees, as old as the thirteenth century, is
viſibly borrowed from the mechanic corporations; in which an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice,
after ſerving his time, obtains a teſtimonial of his ſkill, and
a licence to practiſe his trade and myſtery. It is not my deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate
thoſe honours, which could never gratify or diſappoint my
ambition; and I ſhould applaud the inſtitution, if the degrees of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor
or licentiate were beſtowed as the reward of manly and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
ſtudy: if the name and rank of doctor or maſter were ſtrictly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0112200701:61"/>
reſerved for the profeſſors of ſcience, who have approved their title
to the public eſteem.</p>
            <p>In all the univerſities of Europe, excepting our own, the languages
and ſciences and diſtributed among a numerous liſt of effective pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors:
the ſtudents, according to their taſte, their calling, and their
diligence, apply themſelves to the proper maſters; and in the annual
repetition of public and private lectures, theſe maſters are aſſiduouſly
employed. Our curioſity may inquire what number of profeſſors has
been inſtituted at Oxford? (for I ſhall now confine myſelf to my own
univerſity;) by whom are they appointed, and what may be the
probable chances of merit or incapacity? how many are ſtationed to
the three faculties, and how many are left for the liberal arts? what
is the form, and what the ſubſtance, of their leſſons? But all theſe
queſtions are ſilenced by one ſhort and ſingular anſwer, <q>That in
the univerſity of Oxford, the greater part of the public profeſſors
have for theſe many years given up altogether even the pretence
of teaching.</q> Incredible as the fact may appear, I muſt reſt my
belief on the poſitive and impartial evidence of a maſter of moral and
political wiſdom, who had himſelf reſided at Oxford. Dr. Adam
Smith aſſigns as the cauſe of their indolence, that, inſtead of being
paid by voluntary contributions, which would urge them to increaſe
the number, and to deſerve the gratitude of their pupils, the Oxford
profeſſors are ſecure in the enjoyment of a fixed ſtipend, without the
neceſſity of labour, or the apprehenſion of controul. It has indeed
been obſerved, nor is the obſervation abſurd, that excepting in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
ſciences, which demand a coſtly apparatus and a dexterous
hand, the many valuable treatiſes, that have been publiſhed on every
ſubject of learning, may now ſuperſede the ancient mode of oral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Were this principle true in its utmoſt latitude, I ſhould
only infer that the offices and ſalaries, which are become uſeleſs, ought
without delay to be aboliſhed. But there ſtill remains a material
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0112200701:62"/>
difference between a book and a profeſſor; the hour of the lecture
inforces attendance; attention is fixed by the preſence, the voice,
and the occaſional queſtions of the teacher; the moſt idle will carry
ſomething away; and the more diligent will compare the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which they have heard in the ſchool, with the volumes, which
they peruſe in their chamber. The advice of a ſkilful profeſſor will
adapt a courſe of reading to every mind and every ſituation; his
authority will diſcover, admoniſh, and at laſt chaſtiſe the negligence
of his diſciples; and his vigilant inquiries will aſcertain the ſteps of
their literary progreſs. Whatever ſcience he profeſſes he may il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
in a ſeries of diſcourſes, compoſed in the leiſure of his
cloſet, pronounced on public occaſions, and finally delivered to the
preſs. I obſerve with pleaſure, that in the univerſity of Oxford
Dr. Lowth, with equal eloquence and erudition, has executed this
taſk in his incomparable <hi>Praelections</hi> on the Poetry of the Hebrews.</p>
            <p>The college of St. Mary Magdalen was founded in the fifteenth
century by Wainfleet biſhop of Wincheſter; and now conſiſts
of a preſident, forty fellows, and a number of inferior ſtudents.
It is eſteemed one of the largeſt and moſt wealthy of our acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
corporations, which may be compared to the Benedictine
abbeys of catholic countries; and I have looſely heard that the
eſtates belonging to Magdalen College, which are leaſed by thoſe
indulgent landlords at ſmall quit-rents and occaſional ſines, might
be raiſed, in the hands of private avarice, to an annual revenue of
nearly thirty thouſand pounds. Our colleges are ſuppoſed to be ſchools
of ſcience, as well as of education; nor is it unreaſonable to
expect that a body of literary men, devoted to a life of celibacy,
exempt from the care of their own ſubſiſtence, and amply provided
with books, ſhould devote their leiſure to the proſecution of ſtudy,
and that ſome effects of their ſtudies ſhould be manifeſted to the
world. The ſhelves of their library groan under the weight of the
Benedictine folios, of the editions of the fathers, and the collections
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0112200701:63"/>
of the middle ages, which have iſſued from the ſingle abbey of
St. Germain de Préz at Paris. A compoſition of genius muſt be the
offspring of one mind; but ſuch works of induſtry, as may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
among many hands, and muſt be continued during many
years, are the peculiar province of a laborious community. If I
inquire into the manufactures of the monks of Magdalen, if I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the inquiry to the other colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, a
ſilent bluſh, or a ſcornful frown, will be the only reply. The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
or monks of my time were decent eaſy men, who ſupinely
enjoyed the gifts of the founder: their days were filled by a ſeries
of uniform employments; the chapel and the hall, the coffee-houſe
and the common room, till they retired, weary and well ſatisfied,
to a long ſlumber. From the toil of reading, or thinking, or writing,
they had abſolved their conſcience; and the firſt ſhoots of learning
and ingenuity withered on the ground, without yielding any fruits
to the owners or the public. As a gentleman commoner, I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the ſociety of the fellows, and fondly expected that ſome
queſtions of literature would be the amuſing and inſtructive topics of
their diſcourſe. Their converſation ſtagnated in a round of college
buſineſs, Tory politics, perſonal anecdotes, and private ſcandal: their
dull and deep potations excuſed the briſk intemperance of youth;
and their conſtitutional toaſts were not expreſſive of the moſt lively
loyalty for the houſe of Hanover. A general election was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching:
the great Oxfordſhire conteſt already blazed with all the
malevolence of party-zeal. Magdalen College was devoutly attached
to the old intereſt! and the names of Wenman and Daſhwood were
more frequently pronounced, than thoſe of Cicero and Chryſoſtom.
The example of the ſenior fellows could not inſpire the under-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates
with a liberal ſpirit or ſtudious emulation; and I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
as I never knew, the diſcipline of college. Some duties
may poſſibly have been impoſed on the poor ſcholars, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
aſpired to the peaceful honours of a fellowſhip (<hi>aſcribi
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0112200701:64"/>
quietis ordinibus—Deorum</hi>); but no independent members were
admitted below the rank of a gentleman commoner, and our velvet
cap was the cap of liberty. A tradition prevailed that ſome of our
predeceſſors had ſpoken Latin declamations in the hall; but of this
ancient cuſtom no veſtige remained: the obvious methods of public
exerciſes and examinations were totally unknown; and I have never
heard that either the preſident or the ſociety interfered in the private
oeconomy of the tutors and their pupils.</p>
            <p>The ſilence of the Oxford profeſſors, which deprives the youth
of public inſtruction, is imperfectly ſupplied by the tutors, as they
are ſtyled, of the ſeveral colleges. Inſtead of confining themſelves
to a ſingle ſcience, which had ſatisfied the ambition of Burman or
Bernoulli, they teach, or promiſe to teach, either hiſtory or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics,
or ancient literature, or moral philoſophy; and as it is
poſſible that they may be defective in all, it is highly probable that
of ſome they will be ignorant. They are paid, indeed, by private
contributions; but their appointment depends on the head of the
houſe: their diligence is voluntary, and will conſequently be languid,
while the pupils themſelves, or their parents, are not indulged in
the liberty of choice or change. The firſt tutor into whoſe hands
I was reſigned appears to have been one of the beſt of the tribe:
Dr. Waldegrave was a learned and pious man, of a mild diſpoſition,
ſtrict morals, and abſtemious life, who ſeldom mingled in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics
or the jollity of the college. But his knowledge of the world
was confined to the univerſity; his learning was of the laſt, rather
than of the preſent age; his temper was indolent; his faculties, which
were not of the firſt rate, had been relaxed by the climate, and he
was ſatisfied, like his fellows, with the ſlight and ſuperficial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of an important truſt. As ſoon as my tutor had ſounded the
inſufficiency of his diſciple in ſchool-learning, he propoſed that we
ſhould read every morning from ten to eleven the comedies of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0112200701:65"/>
The ſum of my improvement in the univerſity of Oxford
is confined to three or four Latin plays; and even the ſtudy of an
elegant claſſic, which might have been illuſtrated by a compariſon
of ancient and modern theatres, was reduced to a dry and literal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the author's text. During the firſt weeks I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
attended theſe leſſons in my tutor's room; but as they
appeared equally devoid of profit and pleaſure, I was once tempted
to try the experiment of a formal apology. The apology was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
with a ſmile. I repeated the offence with leſs ceremony;
the excuſe was admitted with the ſame indulgence: the ſlighteſt
motive of lazineſs or indiſpoſition, the moſt trifling avocation at
home or abroad, was allowed as a worthy impediment; nor did my
tutor appear conſcious of my abſence or neglect. Had the hour of
lecture been conſtantly filled, a ſingle hour was a ſmall portion of
my academic leiſure. No plan of ſtudy was recommended for my
uſe; no exerciſes were preſcribed for his inſpection; and, at the
moſt precious ſeaſon of youth, whole days and weeks were ſuffered
to elapſe without labour or amuſement, without advice or account.
I ſhould have liſtened to the voice of reaſon and of my tutor; his
mild behaviour had gained my confidence. I preferred his ſociety to
that of the younger ſtudents; and in our evening walks to the top
of Heddington-hill, we freely converſed on a variety of ſubjects.
Since the days of Pocock and Hyde, Oriental learning has always
been the pride of Oxford, and I once expreſſed an inclination to
ſtudy Arabic. His prudence diſcouraged this childiſh fancy; but
he neglected the fair occaſion of directing the ardour of a curious
mind. During my abſence in the Summer vacation, Dr. Walde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
accepted a college living at Waſhington in Suſſex, and on my
return I no longer found him at Oxford. From that time I have
loſt ſight of my firſt tutor; but at the end of thirty years (1781)
he was ſtill alive; and the practice of exerciſe and temperance had
entitled him to a healthy old age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0112200701:66"/>
The long receſs between the Trinity and Michaelmas terms
empties the colleges of Oxford, as well as the courts of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter.
I ſpent, at my father's houſe at Buriton in Hampſhire,
the two months of Auguſt and September. It is whimſical enough,
that as ſoon as I left Magdalen College, my taſte for books began to
revive; but it was the ſame blind and boyiſh taſte for the purſuit of
exotic hiſtory. Unprovided with original learning, unformed in
the habits of thinking, unſkilled in the arts of compoſition, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved—to
write a book. The title of this firſt Eſſay, <hi>the Age of
Seſoſtris,</hi> was perhaps ſuggeſted by Voltaire's Age of Lewis XIV.
which was new and popular; but my ſole object was to inveſtigate
the probable date of the life and reign of the conqueror of Aſia. I
was then enamoured of Sir John Marſham's Canon Chronicus; an
elaborate work, of whoſe merits and defects I was not yet qualified
to judge. According to his ſpecious, though narrow plan, I ſettled
my hero about the time of Solomon, in the tenth century before the
Chriſtian aera. It was therefore incumbent on me, unleſs I would
adopt Sir Iſaac Newton's ſhorter chronology, to remove a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
objection; and my ſolution, for a youth of fifteen, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of ingenuity. In his verſion of the Sacred Books, Manetho
the high prieſt has identified Sethoſis, or Seſoſtris, with the elder
brother of Danaus, who landed in Greece, according to the Parian
Marble, fifteen hundred and ten years before Chriſt. But in my
ſuppoſition the high prieſt is guilty of a voluntary error; flattery is
the prolific parent of falſehood. Manetho's Hiſtory of Egypt is
dedicated to Ptolemy Philadelphus, who derived a fabulous or ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
pedigree from the Macedonian kings of the race of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.
Danaus is the anceſtor of Hercules; and after the failure
of the elder branch, his deſcendants, the Ptolemies, are the ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
of the royal family, and may claim by inheritance the
kingdom which they hold by conqueſt. Such were my juvenile
diſcoveries; at a riper age, I no longer preſume to connect the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0112200701:67"/>
Greek, the Jewiſh, and the Egyptian antiquities, which are loſt in
a diſtant cloud. Nor is this the only inſtance, in which the belief
and knowledge of the child are ſuperſeded by the more rational
ignorance of the man. During my ſtay at Buriton, my infant-labour
was diligently proſecuted, without much interruption from
company or country diverſions; and I already heard the muſic of
public applauſe. The diſcovery of my own weakneſs was the firſt
ſymptom of taſte. On my return to Oxford, the Age of Seſoſtris
was wiſely relinquiſhed; but the imperfect ſheets remained twenty
years at the bottom of a drawer, till, in a general clearance of papers,
(November 1772,) they were committed to the flames.</p>
            <p>After the departure of Dr. Waldgrave, I was transferred, with his
other pupils, to his academical heir, whoſe literary character did not
command the reſpect of the college. Dr. *** well remembered that
he had a ſalary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Inſtead of guiding the ſtudies, and watching over the behaviour
of his diſciple, I was never ſummoned to attend even the ceremony
of a lecture; and, excepting one voluntary viſit to his rooms, during
the eight months of his titular office, the tutor and pupil lived in the
ſame college as ſtrangers to each other. The want of experience,
of advice, and of occupation, ſoon betrayed me into ſome impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
of conduct, ill-choſen company, late hours, and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
expence. My growing debts might be ſecret; but my frequent
abſence was viſible and ſcandalous: and a tour to Bath, a viſit into
Buckinghamſhire, and four excurſions to Lodon in the ſame winter,
were coſtly and dangerous frolics. They were, indeed, without a
meaning, as without an excuſe. The irkſomeneſs of a cloiſtered
life repeatedly tempted me to wander; but my chief pleaſure was
that of travelling; and I was too young and baſhful to enjoy, like
a Manly Oxonian in Town, the pleaſures of London. In all theſe
excurſions I eloped from Oxford; I returned to college; in a few
days I eloped again, as if I had been an independent ſtranger in a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0112200701:68"/>
hired lodging, without once hearing the voice of admonition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
once feeling the hand of control. Yet my time was loſt, my
expences were multiplied, my behaviour abroad was unknown; folly
as well as vice ſhould have awakened the attention of my ſuperiors,
and my tender years would have juſtified a more than ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of reſtraint and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>It might at leaſt be expected, that an eccleſiaſtical ſchool ſhould
inculcate the orthodox principles of religion. But our venerable
mother had contrived to unite the oppoſite extremes of bigotry and
indifference: an heretic, or unbeliever, was a monſter in her eyes;
but ſhe was always, or often, or ſometimes, remiſs in the ſpiritual
education of her own children. According to the ſtatutes of the
univerſity, every ſtudent, before he is matriculated, muſt ſubſcribe his
aſſent to the thirty-nine articles of the church of England, which are
ſigned by more than read, and read by more than believe them.
My inſufficient age excuſed me, however, from the immediate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this legal ceremony; and the vice-chancellor directed
me to return, as ſoon as I ſhould have accompliſhed my fifteenth year;
recommending me, in the mean while, to the inſtruction of my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
My college forgot to inſtruct: I forgot to return, and was
myſelf forgotten by the firſt magiſtrate of the univerſity. Without
a ſingle lecture, either public or private, either chriſtian or proteſtant,
without any academical ſubſcription, without any epiſcopal confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
I was left by the dim light of my catechiſm to grope my way
to the chapel and communion-table, where I was admitted, without
a queſtion, how far, or by what means, I might be qualified to receive
the ſacrament. Such almoſt incredible neglect was productive of the
worſt miſchiefs. From my childhood I had been fond of religious
diſputation: my poor aunt has been often puzzled by the myſteries
which ſhe ſtrove to believe; nor had the elaſtic ſpring been totally
broken by the weight of the atmoſphere of Oxford. The blind acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of idleneſs urged me to advance without armour into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0112200701:69"/>
mazes of controverſy; and at the age of ſixteen, I bewildered
myſelf in the errors of the church of Rome.</p>
            <p>The progreſs of my converſion may tend to illuſtrate, at leaſt, the
hiſtory of my own mind. It was not long ſince Dr. Middleton's free
inquiry had ſounded an alarm in the theological world: much ink
and much gall had been ſpilt in the defence of the primitive miracles;
and the two dulleſt of their champions were crowned with academic
honours by the univerſity of Oxford. The name of Middleton was
unpopular; and his proſcription very naturally led me to peruſe his
writings, and thoſe of his antagoniſts. His bold criticiſm, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
the precipice of infidelity, produced on my mind a ſingular
effect; and had I perſevered in the communion of Rome, I ſhould
now apply to my own fortune the prediction of the Sybil,
<q>
                  <l>—Via prima ſalutis,</l>
                  <l>Quod minimé reris, Graiâ, pandetur ab urbe.</l>
               </q>
The elegance of ſtyle and freedom of argument were repelled by a
ſhield of prejudice. I ſtill revered the character, or rather the names,
of the ſaints and fathers whom Dr. Middleton expoſes; nor could he
deſtroy my implicit belief, that the gift of miraculous powers was
continued in the church, during the firſt four or five centuries of
chriſtianity. But I was unable to reſiſt the weight of hiſtorical evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that within the ſame period moſt of the leading doctrines of
popery were already introduced in theory and practice: nor was my
concluſion abſurd, that miracles are the teſt of truth, and that the
church muſt be orthodox and pure, which was ſo often approved by
the viſible interpoſition of the Deity. The marvellous tales which
are ſo boldly atteſted by the Baſils and Chryſoſtoms, the Auſtins and
Jeroms, compelled me to embrace the ſuperior merits of celibacy, the
inſtitution of the monaſtic life, the uſe of the ſign of the croſs, of
holy oil, and even of images, the invocation of ſaints, the worſhip
of relics, the rudiments of purgatory in prayers for the dead, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0112200701:70"/>
the tremendous myſtery of the ſacrifice of the body and blood of
Chriſt, which inſenſibly ſwelled into the prodigy of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In theſe diſpoſitions, and already more than half a convert, I
formed an unlucky intimacy with a young gentleman of our college,
whoſe name I ſhall ſpare. With a character leſs reſolute, Mr. ****
had imbibed the ſame religious opinions; and ſome Popiſh books, I
know not through what channel, were conveyed into his poſſeſſion.
I read, I applauded, I believed: the Engliſh tranſlations of two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
works of Boſſuet Biſhop of Meaux, the Expoſition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Doctrine, and the Hiſtory of the Proteſtant Variations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
my converſion, and I ſurely fell by a noble hand<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Gibbon never talked with me on the ſubject of his converſion to popery but once; and then, he imputed his change to the works of Parſons the jeſuit, who lived in the reign of Elizabeth, and who, he ſaid, had urged all the beſt arguments in favour of the Roman catholic religion.</note>. I have
ſince examined the originals with a more diſcerning eye, and ſhall
not heſitate to pronounce, that Boſſuet is indeed a maſter of all the
weapons of controverſy. In the Expoſition, a ſpecious apology, the
orator aſſumes, with conſummate art, the tone of candour and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;
and the ten-horned monſter is tranſformed, at his magic
touch, into the milk-white hind, who muſt be loved as ſoon as ſhe
is ſeen. In the Hiſtory, a bold and well-aimed attack, he diſplays,
with a happy mixture of narrative and argument, the faults and
follies, the changes and contradictions of our firſt reformers;
whoſe variations (as he dexterouſly contends) are the mark of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
error, while the perpetual unity of the catholic church is the
ſign and teſt of infallible truth. To my preſent feelings it ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
that I ſhould ever believe that I believed in tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But my conqueror oppreſſed me with the ſacramental words,
"Hoc eſt corpus meum," and daſhed againſt each other the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
half-meanings of the proteſtant ſects: every objection was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
into omnipotence; and after repeating at St. Mary's the Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0112200701:71"/>
creed, I humbly acquieſced in the myſtery of the real
preſence.
<q>
                  <l>"To take up half on truſt, and half of try,</l>
                  <l>"Name it not faith, but bungling bigotry.</l>

                  <l>"For who would break with Heaven, and would not break for all?"</l>
               </q>
No ſooner had I ſettled my new religion than I reſolved to profeſs
myſelf a catholic. Youth is ſincere and impetuous; and a moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
glow of enthuſiaſm had raiſed me above all temporal conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations<note n="*" place="bottom">He deſcribed the letter to his father, announcing his converſion, as written with all the pomp, the dignity, and ſelf-ſatisfaction of a martyr.</note>.</p>
            <p>By the keen proteſtants, who would gladly retaliate the example
of perſecution, a clamour is raiſed of the increaſe of popery: and
they are always loud to declaim againſt the toleration of prieſts and
jeſuits, who pervert ſo many of his majeſty's ſubjects from their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and allegiance. On the preſent occaſion, the fall of one or more
of her ſons directed this clamour againſt the univerſity; and it was
confidently affirmed that popiſh miſſionaries were ſuffered, under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
diſguiſes, to introduce themſelves into the colleges of Oxford.
But juſtice obliges me to declare, that, as far as relates to myſelf,
this aſſertion is falſe; and that I never converſed with a prieſt, or
even with a papiſt, till my reſolution from books was abſolutely
fixed. In my laſt excurſion to London, I addreſſed myſelf to Mr.
Lewis, a Roman catholic bookſeller in Ruſſell-ſtreet, Covent Garden,
who recommended me to a prieſt, of whoſe name and order I am at
preſent ignorant. In our firſt interview he ſoon diſcovered that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
was needleſs. After ſounding the motives and merits of my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0112200701:72"/>
converſion, he conſented to admit me into the pale of the church;
and at his feet, on the eighth of June 1753, I ſolemnly, though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
abjured the errors of hereſy. The ſeduction of an Engliſh
youth of family and fortune was an act of as much danger as glory; but
he bravely overlooked the danger, of which I was not then ſufficiently
informed. <q>Where a perſon is reconciled to the ſee of Rome, or
procures others to be reconciled, the offence (ſays Blackſtone)
amounts to high treaſon.</q> And if the humanity of the age would
prevent the execution of this ſanguinary ſtatute, there were other
laws of a leſs odious caſt, which condemned the prieſt to perpetual
impriſonment, and tranſferred the proſelyte's eſtate to his neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
An elaborate controverſial epiſtle, approved by my director,
and addreſſed to my father, announced and juſtified the ſtep which I
had taken. My father was neither a bigot nor a philoſopher; but
his affection deplored the loſs of an only ſon; and his good ſenſe was
aſtoniſhed at my ſtrange departure from the religion of my country.
In the firſt ſally of paſſion he divulged a ſecret which prudence might
have ſuppreſſed, and the gates of Magdalen College were for ever ſhut
againſt my return. Many years afterwards, when the name of Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon
was become as notorious as that of Middleton, it was induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
whiſpered at Oxford, that the hiſtorian had formerly "turned
papiſt:" my character ſtood expoſed to the reproach of inconſtancy;
and this invidious topic would have been handled without mercy by
my opponents, could they have ſeparated my cauſe from that of the
univerſity. For my own part, I am proud of an honeſt ſacrifice of
intereſt to conſcience. I can never bluſh, if my tender mind was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in the ſophiſtry that ſeduced the acute and manly underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of CHILLINGWORTH and BAYLE, who afterwards emerged
from ſuperſition to ſcepticiſm.</p>
            <p>While Charles the Firſt goverened England, and was himſelf go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by a catholic queen, it cannot be denied that the miſſionaries
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0112200701:73"/>
of Rome laboured with impunity and ſucceſs in the court, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and even the univerſities. One of the ſheep,
<q>
                  <l>—Whom the grim wolf with privy paw</l>
                  <l>Daily devours apace, and nothing ſaid,</l>
               </q>
is Mr. William Chillingworth, Maſter of Arts, and Fellow of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
College, Oxford; who, at the ripe age of twenty-eight years,
was perſuaded to elope from Oxford, to the Engliſh ſeminary at
Douay in Flanders. Some diſputes with Fiſher, a ſubtle jeſuit, might
firſt awaken him from the prejudices of education; but he yielded to
his own victorious argument, <q>that there muſt be ſomewhere an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
judge; and that the church of Rome is the only chriſtian
ſociety which either does or can pretend to that character.</q> After
a ſhort trial of a few months, Mr. Chillingworth was again tormented
by religious ſcruples: he returned home, reſumed his ſtudies, unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
his miſtakes, and delivered his mind from the yoke of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and ſuperſtition. His new creed was built on the principle, that
the Bible is our ſole judge, and private reaſon our ſole interpreter:
and he ably maintains this principle in the Religion of a Proteſtant,
a book which, after ſtartling the doctors of Oxford, is ſtill eſteemed
the moſt ſolid defence of the Reformation. The learning, the virtue,
the recent merits of the author, entitled him to fair preferment: but
the ſlave had now bróken his fetters; and the more he weighed, the leſs
was he diſpoſed to ſubſcribe to the thirty-nine articles of the church
of England. In a private letter he declares, with all the energy of
language, that he could not ſubſcribe to them without ſubſcribing to his
own damnation; and that if ever he ſhould depart from this immoveable
reſolution, he would allow his friends to think him a madman, or an
atheiſt. As the letter is without a date, we cannot aſcertain the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of weeks or months that elapſed between this paſſionate abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and the Saliſbury Regiſter, which is ſtill extant. <q>Ego Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmus
Chillingworth,...omnibus hiſce articulis,...et ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis

in iiſdem contentis volens, et ex animo ſubſcribo, et conſenſum
meum iiſdem praebeo. 20 die Julii 1638.</q> But, alas! the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
and prebendary of Sarum ſoon deviated from his own ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as he more deeply ſcrutinized the article of the Trinity, neither
ſcripture nor the primitive fathers could long uphold his orthodox
belief; and he could not but confeſs, <q>that the doctrine of Arius is
either a truth, or at leaſt no damnable hereſy.</q> From this middle
region of the air, the deſcent of his reaſon would naturally reſt on
the firmer ground of the Socinians: and if we may credit a doubtful
ſtory, and the popular opinion, his anxious inquiries at laſt ſubſided
in philoſophic indifference. So conſpicuous, however, were the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of his nature and the innocence of his heart, that this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
levity did not affect the reputation of Chillingworth. His fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
changes proceeded from too nice an inquiſition into truth.
His doubts grew out of himſelf; he aſſiſted them with all the ſtrength
of his reaſon: he was then too hard for himſelf; but finding as little
quiet and repoſe in thoſe victories, he quickly recovered, by a new
appeal to his own judgment: ſo that in all his fallies and retreats, he
was in fact his own convert.</p>
            <p>Bayle was the ſon of a Calviniſt miniſter in a remote province of
France, at the foot of the Pyrenees. For the benefit of education,
the proteſtants were tempted to riſk their children in the catholic
univerſities; and in the twenty-ſecond year of his age, young Bayle
was ſeduced by the arts and arguments of the jeſuits of Thoulouſe.
He remained about ſeventeen months (19th March 1669—19th Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
1670) in their hands, a voluntary captive; and a letter to his
parents, which the new convert compoſed or ſubſcribed (15th April
1670), is darkly tinged with the ſpirit of popery. But Nature had
deſigned him to think as he pleaſed, and to ſpeak as he thought: his
piety was offended by the exceſſive worſhip of creatures; and the
ſtudy of phyſics convinced him of the impoſſibility of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is abundantly refuted by the teſtimony of our ſenſes.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0112200701:75"/>
His return to the communion of a falling ſect was a bold and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
ſtep, that expoſed him to the rigour of the laws; and a ſpeedy
flight to Geneva protected him from the reſentment of his ſpiritual
tyrants, unconſcious as they were of the full value of the prize, which
they had loſt. Had Bayle adhered to the catholic church, had he
embraced the eccleſiaſtical profeſſion, the genius and favour of ſuch
a proſelyte might have aſpired to wealth and honours in his native
country: but the hypocrite would have found leſs happineſs in the
comforts of a benefice, or the dignity of a mitre, than he enjoyed at
Rotterdam in a private ſtate of exile, indigence, and freedom. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a country, or a patron, or a prejudice, he claimed the liberty and
ſubſiſted by the labours of his pen: the inequality of his voluminous
works is explained and excuſed by his alternately writing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for the bookſellers, and for poſterity; and if a ſevere critic would
reduce him to a ſingle folio, that relic, like the books of the Sybil,
would become ſtill more valuable. A calm and lofty ſpectator of the
religious tempeſt, the philoſopher of Rotterdam condemned with
equal firmneſs the perſecution of Lewis the Fourteenth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
maxims of the Calviniſts; their vain prophecies, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerant
bigotry which ſometimes vexed his ſolitary retreat. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing
the controverſies of the times, he turned againſt each other
the arguments of the diſputants; ſucceſſively wielding the arms of the
catholics and proteſtants, he proves that neither the way of authority,
nor the way of examination can afford the multitude any teſt of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
truth; and dexterouſly concludes that cuſtom and education muſt
be the ſole grounds of popular belief. The ancient paradox of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,
that atheiſm is leſs pernicious than ſuperſtition, acquires a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
vigor, when it is adorned with the colours of his wit, and pointed
with the acuteneſs of his logic. His critical dictionary is a vaſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
of facts and opinions; and he balances the <hi>falſe</hi> religions in his
ſceptical ſcales, till the oppoſite quantities (if I may uſe the language
of algebra) annihilate each other. The wonderful power which he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0112200701:76"/>
ſo boldly exerciſed, of aſſembling doubts and objections, had tempted
him jocoſely to aſſume the title of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the cloud-compelling
Jove; and in a converſation with the ingenious Abbé
(afterwards Cardinal) de Polignac, he freely diſcloſed his univerſal
Pyrrhoniſm. <q>I am moſt truly (ſaid Bayle) a proteſtant; for I
proteſt indifferently againſt all ſyſtems and all ſects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The academical reſentment, which I may poſſibly have provoked,
will prudently ſpare this plain narrative of my ſtudies, or rather of
my idleneſs; and of the unfortunate event which ſhortened the term
of my reſidence at Oxford. But it may be ſuggeſted, that my father
was unlucky in the choice of a ſociety, and the chance of a tutor. It
will perhaps be aſſerted, that in the lapſe of forty years many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
have taken place in the college and in the univerſity. I
am not unwilling to believe, that ſome tutors might have been found
more active than Dr. Waldgrave, and leſs contemptible than Dr. ****.
About the ſame time, and in the ſame walk, a Bentham was ſtill
treading in the footſteps of a Burton, whoſe maxims he had adopted,
and whoſe life he had publiſhed. The biographer indeed preferred
the ſchool-logic to the new philoſophy, Bugurſdicius to Locke; and
the hero appears, in his own writings, a ſtiff and conceited pedant.
Yet even theſe men, according to the meaſure of their capacity,
might be diligent and uſeful; and it is recorded of Burton, that he
taught his pupils what he knew; ſome Latin, ſome Greek, ſome
ethics and metaphyſics; referring them to proper maſters for the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
and ſciences of which he was ignorant. At a more recent
period, many ſtudents have been attracted by the merit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sir William Scott, then a tutor in Univerſity College, and
now conſpicuous in the profeſſion of the civil law: my perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with that gentleman has inſpired me with a juſt eſteem for
his abilities and knowledge; and I am aſſured that his lectures on hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
would compoſe, were they given to the public, a moſt valuable
treatiſe. Under the auſpices of the preſent Archbiſhop of York,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0112200701:77"/>
Dr. Markham, himſelf an eminent ſcholar, a more regular diſcipline
has been introduced, as I am told, at Chriſt Church<note n="*" place="bottom">This was written on the information Mr. Gibbon had received, and the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had made, previous to his late reſidence at Lauſanne. During his laſt viſit to England, he had an opportunity of ſeeing at Sheffield-place ſome young men of the college above alluded to; he had great ſatisfaction in converſing with them, made many inquiries reſpecting their courſe of ſtudy, applauded the diſcipline of Chriſt Church, and the liberal attention ſhewn by the Dean, to thoſe whoſe only recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was their merit. Had Mr. Gibbon lived to reviſe this work, I am ſure he would have mentioned the name of Dr. Jackſon with the higheſt commendation. There are other colleges at Oxford, with whoſe diſcipline my friend was unacquainted, to which, without doubt, he would willingly have allowed their due praiſe, particularly Brazen Noſe and Oriel Colleges; the former under the care of Dr. Cleaver, biſhop of Cheſter, the latter under that of Dr. Eveleigh. It is ſtill greatly to be wiſhed that the general expence, or rather extravagance, of young men at our Engliſh univerſities may be more effectually reſtrained. The expence, in which they are permitted to indulge, is inconſiſtent not only with a neceſſary degree of ſtudy, but with thoſe habits of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality which ſhould be promoted, by all means poſſible, at an early period of life. An academical education in England is at preſent an object of alarm and terror to every thinking parent of moderate fortune. It is the apprehenſion of the expence, of the diſſipation, and other evil conſequences, which ariſe from the want of proper reſtraint at our own univerſities, that forces a number of our Engliſh youths to thoſe of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and utterly excludes many from any ſort of academical inſtruction. If a charge be true, which I have heard inſiſted on, that the heads of our colleges in Oxford and Cambridge are vain of having under their care chiefly men of opulence, who may be ſuppoſed exempt from the neceſſity of oeconomical controul, they are indeed highly cenſurable; ſince the miſchief of allowing early habits of expence and diſſipation is great, in various reſpects, even to thoſe poſſeſſed of large property; and the moſt ſerious evil from this indulgence muſt happen to youths of humbler fortune, who certainly form the majority of ſtudents both at Oxford and Cambridge. S.</note>; a courſe of
claſſical and philoſophical ſtudies is propoſed, and even purſued, in
that numerous ſeminary: learning has been made a duty, a pleaſure,
and even a faſhion; and ſeveral young gentlemen do honour to
the college in which they have been educated. According to the
will of the donor, the profit of the ſecond part of Lord Clarendon's
Hiſtory has been applied to the eſtabliſhment of a riding-ſchool, that
the polite exerciſes might be taught, I know not with what ſucceſs,
in the univerſity. The Vinerian profeſſorſhip is of far more ſerious
importance; the laws of his country are the firſt ſcience of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0112200701:78"/>
of rank and fortune, who is called to be a magiſtrate, and
may hope to be a legiſlator. This judicious inſtitution was coldly
entertained by the graver doctors, who complained (I have heard the
complaint) that it would take the young people from their books:
but Mr. Viner's benefaction is not unprofitable, ſince it has at leaſt
produced the excellent commentaries of Sir William Blackſtone.</p>
            <p>After carrying me to Putney, to the houſe of his friend Mr. Mallet<note n="*" place="bottom">The author of a life of Bacon, which has been rated above its value; of ſome forgotten poems and plays; and of the pathetic ballad of William and Margaret.</note>,
by whoſe philoſophy I was rather ſcandalized than reclaimed, it was
neceſſary for my father to form a new plan of education, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
ſome method which, if poſſible, might effect the cure of my
ſpiritual malady. After much debate it was determined, from the
advice and perſonal experience of Mr. Eliot (now Lord Eliot) to fix
me, during ſome years, at Lauſanne in Switzerland. Mr. Frey, a
Swiſs gentleman of Baſil, undertook the conduct of the journey: we
left London the 19th of June, croſſed the ſea from Dover to Calais,
travelled poſt through ſeveral provinces of France, by the direct road
of St. Quentin, Rheims, Langres, and Beſançon, and arrived the
30th of June at Lauſanne, where I was immediately ſettled under
the roof and tuition of Mr. Pavilliard, a Calviniſt miniſter.</p>
            <p>The firſt marks of my father's diſpleaſure rather aſtoniſhed than
afflicted me: when he threatened to baniſh, and diſown, and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
a rebellious ſon, I cheriſhed a ſecret hope that he would not be
able or willing to effect his menaces; and the pride of conſcience
encouraged me to ſuſtain the honourable and important part which I
was now acting. My ſpirits were raiſed and kept alive by the rapid
motion of my journey, the new and various ſcenes of the Continent,
and the civility of Mr. Frey, a man of ſenſe, who was not ignorant
of books or the world. But after he had reſigned me into Pavilliard's
hands, and I was fixed in my new habitation, I had leiſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0112200701:79"/>
the ſtrange and melancholy proſpect before me. My firſt
complaint aroſe from my ignorance of the language. In my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
I had once ſtudied the French grammar, and I could imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
underſtand the eaſy proſe of a familiar ſubject. But when I
was thus ſuddenly caſt on a foreign land, I found myſelf deprived of
the uſe of ſpeech and of hearing; and, during ſome weeks, incapable
not only of enjoying the pleaſures of converſation, but even of aſking
or anſwering a queſtion in the common intercourſe of life. To a
home-bred Engliſhman every object, every cuſtom was offenſive;
but the native of any country might have been diſguſted with the
general aſpect of his lodging and entertainment. I had now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
my elegant apartment in Magdalen College, for a narrow,
gloomy ſtreet, the moſt unfrequented of an unhandſome town, for
an old inconvenient houſe, and for a ſmall chamber ill-contrived and
ill-furniſhed, which, on the approach of Winter, inſtead of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panionable
fire, muſt be warmed by the dull inviſible heat of a ſtove.
From a man I was again degraded to the dependance of a ſchool-boy.
Mr. Pavilliard managed my expences, which had been reduced to
a diminutive ſtate: I received a ſmall monthly allowance for my
pocket-money; and helpleſs and awkward as I have ever been,
I no longer enjoyed the indiſpenſable comfort of a ſervant. My
condition ſeemed as deſtitute of hope, as it was devoid of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
I was ſeparated for an indefinite, which appeared an infinite
term from my native country; and I had loſt all connection with
my catholic friends. I have ſince reflected with ſurpriſe, that as the
Romiſh clergy of every part of Europe maintain a cloſe correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with each other, they never attempted, by letters or meſſages,
to reſcue me from the hands of the heretics, or at leaſt to confirm
my zeal and conſtancy in the profeſſion of the faith. Such was my
firſt introduction to Lauſanne; a place where I ſpent nearly five years
with pleaſure and profit, which I afterwards reviſited without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
and which I have finally ſelected as the moſt grateful retreat
for the decline of my life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0112200701:80"/>
But it is the peculiar felicity of youth that the moſt unpleaſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and events ſeldom make a deep or laſting impreſſion; it forgets
the paſt, enjoys the preſent, and anticipates the future. At the
flexible age of ſixteen I ſoon learned to endure, and gradually to
adopt, the new forms of arbitrary manners: the real hardſhips of my
ſituation were alienated by time. Had I been ſent abroad in a more
ſplendid ſtyle, ſuch as the fortune and bounty of my father might
have ſupplied, I might have returned home with the ſame ſtock of
language and ſcience, which our countrymen uſually import from the
Continent. An exile and a priſoner as I was, their example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
me into ſome irregularities of wine, of play, and of idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions:
but I ſoon felt the impoſſibility of aſſociating with them on
equal terms; and after the departure of my firſt acquaintance, I held
a cold and civil correſpondence with their ſucceſſors. This ſecluſion
from Engliſh ſociety was attended with the moſt ſolid benefits. In
the <hi>Pays de Vaud,</hi> the French language is uſed with leſs imperfection
than in moſt of the diſtant provinces of France: in Pavilliard's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
neceſſity compelled me to liſten and to ſpeak; and if I was at
firſt diſheartened by the apparent ſlowneſs, in a few months I was
aſtoniſhed by the rapidity of my progreſs. My pronunciation was
formed by the conſtant repetition of the ſame ſounds; the variety of
words and idioms, the rules of grammar, and diſtinctions of genders,
were impreſſed in my memory: eaſe and freedom were obtained by
practice; correctneſs and elegance by labour; and before I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
home, French, in which I ſpontaneouſly thought, was more
familiar than Engliſh to my ear, my tongue, and my pen. The firſt
effect of this opening knowledge was the revival of my love of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which had been chilled at Oxford; and I ſoon turned over,
without much choice, almoſt all the French books in my tutor's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.
Even theſe amuſements were productive of real advantage:
my taſte and judgment were now ſomewhat riper. I was introduced
to a new mode of ſtyle and literature: by the compariſon of manners
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0112200701:81"/>
and opinions, my views were enlarged, my prejudices were corrected,
and a copious voluntary abſtract of the <hi>Hiſtoire de l'Egliſe at de l'Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
by le Sueur, may be placed in a middle line between my childiſh
and my manly ſtudies. As ſoon as I was able to converſe with the
natives, I began to feel ſome ſatisfaction in their company: my awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
timidity was poliſhed and emboldened; and I frequented, for
the firſt time, aſſemblies of men and women. The acquaintance of
the Pavilliards prepared me by degrees for more elegant ſociety. I
was received with kindneſs and indulgence in the beſt families of
Lauſanne; and it was in one of theſe that I formed an intimate and
laſting connection with Mr. Deyverdun, a young man of an amiable
temper and excellent underſtanding. In the arts of fencing and
dancing, ſmall indeed was my proficiency; and ſome months were
idly waſted in the riding-ſchool. My unfitneſs to bodily exerciſe
reconciled me to a ſedentary life, and the horſe, the favourite of my
countrymen, never contributed to the pleaſures of my youth.</p>
            <p>My obligations to the leſſons of Mr. Pavilliard, gratitude will not
ſuffer me to forget: he was endowed with a clear head and a warm
heart; his innate benevolence had aſſuaged the ſpirit of the church;
he was rational, becauſe he was moderate: in the courſe of his ſtudies
he had acquired a juſt though ſuperficial knowledge of moſt branches
of literature; by long practice, he was ſkilled in the arts of teaching;
and he laboured with aſſiduous patience to know the character, gain
the affection, and open the mind of his Engliſh pupil<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0112200701:82"/>
we began to underſtand each other, he gently led me, from a blind
and undiſtinguiſhing love of reading, into the path of inſtruction.
I conſented with pleaſure that a portion of the morning-hours ſhould
be conſecrated to a plan of modern hiſtory and geography, and to the
critical peruſal of the French and Latin claſſics; and at each ſtep I
felt myſelf invigorated by the habits of application and method. His
prudence repreſſed and diſſembled ſome youthful fallies; and as ſoon
as I was confirmed in the habits of induſtry and temperance, he gave
the reins into my own hands. His favourable report of my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and progreſs gradually obtained ſome latitude of action and
expence; and he wiſhed to alleviate the hardſhips of my lodging and
entertainment. The principles of philoſophy were aſſociated with
the examples of taſte; and by a ſingular chance, the book, as well as
the man, which contributed the moſt effectually to my education, has
a ſtronger claim on my gratitude than on my admiration. Mr. De
Crouſaz, the adverſary of Bayle and Pope, is not diſtinguiſhed by lively
fancy or profound reflection; and even in his own country, at the
end of a few years, his name and writings are almoſt obliterated.
But his philoſophy had been formed in the ſchool of Locke, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0112200701:83"/>
in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious
life, ſeveral generations of pupils were taught to think, and even to
write; his leſſons reſcued the academy of Lauſanne from Calviniſtic
prejudice; and he had the rare merit of diffuſing a more liberal ſpirit
among the clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud. His ſyſtem of
logic, which in the laſt editions has ſwelled to ſix tedious and prolix
volumes, may be praiſed as a clear and methodical abridgment of the
art of reaſoning, from our ſimple ideas to the moſt complex opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the human underſtanding. This ſyſtem I ſtudied, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
and abſtracted, till I have obtained the free command of an
univerſal inſtrument, which I ſoon preſumed to exerciſe on my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
opinions. Pavilliard was not unmindful that his firſt taſk, his
moſt important duty, was to reclaim me from the errors of popery.
The intermixture of ſects has rendered the Swiſs clergy acute and
learned on the topics of controverſy; and I have ſome of his letters
in which he celebrates the dexterity of his attack, and my gradual
conceſſions, after a firm and well-managed defence<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Pavilliard has deſcribed to me the aſtoniſhment with which he gazed on Mr. Gibbon ſtanding before him: a thin little figure, with a large head, diſputing and urging, with the greateſt ability, all the beſt arguments that had ever been uſed in favour of popery. Mr. Gibbon many years ago became very fat and corpulent, but he had uncommonly ſmall bones, and was very ſlight made.</note>. I was willing,
and I am now willing, to allow him a handſome ſhare of the honour
of my converſion: yet I muſt obſerve, that it was principally effected
by my private reflections; and I ſtill remember my ſolitary tranſport
at the diſcovery of a philoſophical argument againſt the doctrine of
tranſubſtantiation: <hi>that</hi> the text of ſcripture, which ſeems to inculcate

                        <p>J'eſpère que vous pardonnerez mon long ſilence en faveur des nouvelles que j'ai à vous apprendre. Si j'ai tant tardé, ce n'a été ni par oubli, ni par negligence, mais je croyois de ſemaine en ſemaine pouvoir vous annoncer que Monſieur votre ſils avoit entierement renoncé aux fauſſes idées qu'il avoit embraſſées; mais il a fallu diſputer le terrein pié à pié, et je n'ai pas trouvé en lui un homme leger, et qui paſſe rapide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment d'un ſentiment à un autre. Souvent après avoir detruit toutes ſes idées ſur un article de maniere qu'il n'avoit rien à repliquer, ce qu'il avouoit ſans detour, il me diſoit qu'il ne croioit pas, qu'il n'y eut rien à me repondre. La deſſus je n'ai pas jugé qu'il fallut le pouſſer à bout, et extorquer de lui un aveu que ſon coeur deſavoueroit; je lui donnois alors du tems pour réfléchir; tous mes livres etoient à ſa diſpoſition; je revenois à la charge quand il m'avouoit qu'il avoit etudié la matiere auſſi bien qu'il l'avoit pu, et enſin j'etabliſſoit une verité.</p>
                        <p>Je me perſuadois, que quand j'aurois detruit les principales erreurs de l'egliſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, je n'aurois qu'à faire voir que les autres ſont des conſequences des premières, et qu'elles ne peuvent ſubſiſter quand les fundamentales ſont renverſées; mais, comme je l'ai dit, je me ſuis trompé, il a fallu traitter chaque article dans ſon entier. Par la grace de Dieu, je n'ai pas perdu mon tems, et aujourdhui, ſi meme il conſerve quelques reſtes de ſes pernicieuſes erreurs, j'oſe dire qu'il n'eſt plus membre de l'egliſe Romaine; voici dans où nous en ſommes.</p>
                        <p>J'ai renverſé l'infallibilité de l'egliſe; j'ai prouvé que jamais St. Pierre n'a été chef des apôtres; que quand il l'auroit été, le pape n'eſt point ſon ſucceſſeur; qu'il eſt dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuſe que St. Pierre a jamais été à Rome, mais ſuppoſé qu'il y ait été, il n'a pas été evêque de cette ville: que la tranſubſtantiation eſt un invention humaine, et peu ancienne dans l'egliſe; que l'adoration de l'Euchariſte et le retranchement de la coupe ſont contraires à la parole de Dieu: qu'il y a des ſaints, mais que nous ne ſavons pas que ils ſont, et par conſequent qu'on ne peut pas le prier; que le reſpect et le culte qu'on rend aux reliques eſt condamnable; qu'il n'y a point de purgatoire, et que la doctrine des indulgences eſt fauſſe: que la Careme et les jeunes du Vendredi et du Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi ſont ridicules aujourdhui, et de la maniere que l'egliſe Romaine les preſcrit: que les imputations que l'egliſe de Rome nous fait de varier dans notre doctrine, et d'avoir pour reformateurs des perſonnes dont la conduite et les moeurs ont été en ſcandale, ſont entierement fauſſes.</p>
                        <p>Vous comprenez bien, Monſieur, que ces articles ſont d'un longue diſcuſſion, qu'il a fallu du tems à Monſieur votre ſils pour mediter mes raiſons et pour y chercher des reponſes. Je lui ai demandé pluſieurs ſois, ſi mes preuves et mes raiſons lui paroiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoient convainquantes; il m'a toujours aſſuré qu'oui, de façon que j'oſe aſſurer, auſſi comme je le lui a dit à lui meme, il y a peu de tems qu'il n'étoit plus catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. Je me flatte, qu'après avoir obtenu la victoire ſur ces articles, je l'aurai ſur le reſte avec le ſecours de Dieu. Tellement que je compte de vous marquer dans peu que cette ouvrage eſt fini, je dois vous dire encore, que quoique j'ai trouvé M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> votre fils très ferme dans ſes idées, je l'ai trouvé raiſonnable, qu'il s'eſt rendu à la lumière, et qu'il n'eſt pas, ce qu'on appelle, chicaneur. Par raport à l'article du jeune le Venredi et Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi, long tems apres que je vous eus ecrit qu'il n'avoit jamais marqué qu'il voulut l'ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, environ le commencement du mois de Mars je m'aperçus un Vendredi qu'il ne mangeoit point de viande; je lui parlai en particulier pour en ſavoir la raiſon, craig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant que ce ne fut par indiſpoſition; il me repondit qu'il l'avoit fait à deſſein, et qu'il avoit cru être obligé de ſe conformer à la pratique d'un egliſe dont il etoit membre: nous parlames quelques tems ſur ce ſujet; il m'aſſura qu'il n'inviſageoit cela que comme une pratique bonne à la verité, et qu'il devoit ſuivre, quoiqu'il ne la crus pas ſainte en elle meme, ni d'inſtitution divine. Je ne crus pas devoir inſiſter pour lors, ni le forcer à agir contre ſes lumières: j'ai traitté cette article qu'eſt certainement un des moins importans, des moins fondés; et cependant il m'a fallu un tems conſiderable pour le detromper, et pour lui faire comprendre qu'il avoit tort de s'aſſujettir à la pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique d'un Egliſe qu'il ne reconnoiſſoit plus pour infaillible; que ſi meme cette pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique avoit eu quelque utilité dans ſon inſtitution, cependant elle n'en avoit aucune en elle meme, puis qu'elle ne contribuoit en rien à la pureté des moeurs; qu'ainſi il n'y avoit aucune raiſon, ni dans l'inſtitution de cette pratique, ni dans la pratique en elle même, que l'autorisât à s'y ſoumettre: qu'aujourdhui ce n'etoit qu'une affaire d'interet, puis qu'avec de l'argent on obtennoit des diſpenſes pour manger gras, &amp;c. de manier que je l'ai ramené à la liberté Chretienne avec beaucoup de peine et ſeulement depuis quelques ſe maines. Je l'ai engagé a vous ecrire, pour vous manifeſter les ſentimens où il eſt, et l'etat de ſa ſanté, et je crois qu'il l'a fait.</p>

Such, from my arrival at Lauſanne, during the firſt eighteen or
twenty months (July 1753—March 1755), were my uſeful ſtudies,
the foundation of all my future improvements. But every man who
riſes above the common level has received two educations: the firſt
from his teachers; the ſecond, more perſonal and important, from
himſelf. He will not, like the fanatics of the laſt age, define the
moment of grace; but he cannot forget the aera of his life, in which
his mind has expanded to its proper form and dimenſions. My
worthy tutor had the good ſenſe and modeſty to diſcorn how far he
could be uſeful: as ſoon as he felt that I advanced beyond his ſpeed
and meaſure, he wiſely left me to my genius; and the hours of leſſon
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0112200701:86"/>
were ſoon loſt in the voluntary labour of the whole morning, and
ſometimes of the whole day. The deſire of prolonging my time,
gradually confirmed the ſalutary habit of early riſing; to which I have
always adhered, with ſome regard to ſeaſons and ſituations: but it is
happy for my eyes and my health, that my temperate ardour has
never been ſeduced to treſpaſs on the hours of the night. During the
laſt three years of my reſidence at Lauſanne, I may aſſume the merit
of ſerious and ſolid application; but I am tempted to diſtinguiſh the
laſt eight months of the year 1755, as the period of the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
diligence and rapid progreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">JOURNAL, December 1755.]—In finiſhing this year, I muſt remark how favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it was to my ſtudies. In the ſpace of eight months, from the beginning of April, I learnt the principles of drawing; made myſelf complete maſter of the French and Latin languages, with which I was very ſuperficially acquainted before, and wrote and tranſlated a great deal in both; read Cicero's Epiſtles ad Familiares, his Brutus, all his Orations, his Dialogues de Amicitiâ, and De Senectute; Terence, twice; and Pliny's Epiſtles. In French, Giannone's Hiſtory of Naples, and l'Abbé Bannier's Mythology, and M. de Boehat's Memoirs ſur la Suiſſe, and wrote a very ample relation of my tour. I likewiſe began to ſtudy Greek, and went through the Grammar. I begun to make very large collections of what I read. But what I eſteem moſt of all, from the peruſal and meditation of De Crouſaz's Logic, I not only underſtood the principles of that ſcience, but formed my mind to a habit of thinking and reaſoning I had no idea of before.</note>. In my French and Latin
tranſlations I adopted an excellent method, which, from my own ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
I would recommend to the imitation of ſtudents. I choſe ſome
claſſic writer, ſuch as Cicero and Vertot, the moſt approved for
purity and elegance of ſtyle. I tranſlated, for inſtance, an epiſtle of
Cicero into French; and after throwing it aſide, till the words and
phraſes were obliterated from my memory, I re-tranſlated my French
into ſuch Latin as I could find; and then compared each ſentence of
my imperfect verſion, with the eaſe, the grace, the propriety of the
Roman orator. A ſimilar experiment was made on ſeveral pages of
the Revolutions of Vertot; I turned them into Latin, returned them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0112200701:87"/>
after a ſufficient interval into my own French, and again ſcrutinized
the reſemblance or diſſimilitude of the copy and the original. By
degrees I was leſs aſhamed, by degrees I was more ſatisfied with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and I perſevered in the practice of theſe double tranſlations,
which filled ſeveral books, till I had acquired the knowledge of both
idioms, and the command at leaſt of a correct ſtyle. This uſeful
exerciſe of writing was accompanied and ſucceeded by the more
pleaſing occupation of reading the beſt authors. The peruſal of the
Roman claſſics was at once my exerciſe and reward. Dr. Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's
Hiſtory, which I then appreciated above its true value, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
directed me to the writings of Cicero. The moſt perfect edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that of Olivet, which may adorn the ſhelves of the rich, that of
Erneſti, which ſhould lie on the table of the learned, were not in my
power. For the familiar epiſtles I uſed the text and Engliſh comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
of Biſhop Roſs: but my general edition was that of Verburgius,
publiſhed at Amſterdam in two large volumes in folio, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
choice of various notes. I read, with application and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<hi>all</hi> the epiſtles, <hi>all</hi> the orations, and the moſt important trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
of rhetoric and philoſophy; and as I read, I applauded the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Quintillian, that every ſtudent may judge of his own
proficiency, by the ſatisfaction which he receives from the Roman
orator. I taſted the beauties of language, I breathed the ſpirit of
freedom, and I imbibed from his precepts and examples the public
and private ſenſe of a man. Cicero in Latin, and Xenophon in
Greek, are indeed the two ancients whom I would firſt propoſe to a
liberal ſcholar; not only for the merit of their ſtyle and ſentiments,
but for the admirable leſſons, which may be applied almoſt to every
ſituation of public and private life. Cicero's Epiſtles may in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
afford the models of every form of correſpondence, from the
careleſs effuſions of tenderneſs and friendſhip, to the well-guarded
declaration of diſcreet and dignified reſentment. After finiſhing this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0112200701:88"/>
great author, a library of eloquence and reaſon, I formed a more
extenſive plan of reviewing the Latin claſſics<note n="*" place="bottom">JOURNAL, January 1756.]—I determined to read over the Latin authors in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and read this year, Virgil, Salluſt, Livy, Velleius Paterculus, Valerius Maximus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Juſtin, Florus, Plautus, Terence, and Lucretius. I alſo read and meditated Locke upon the Underſtanding.</note>, under the four divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of, 1. hiſtorians, 2. poets, 3. orators, and 4. philoſophers, in
a chronological ſeries, from the days of Plautus and Salluſt, to the
decline of the language and empire of Rome: and this plan, in the
laſt twenty-ſeven months of my reſidence at Lauſanne (January
1756—April 1758), I <hi>nearly</hi> accompliſhed. Nor was this review,
however rapid, either haſty or ſuperſicial. I indulged myſelf in a
ſecond and even a third peruſal of Terence, Virgil, Horace, Tacitus,
&amp;c. and ſtudied to imbibe the ſenſe and ſpirit moſt congenial to my
own. I never ſuffered a difficult or corrupt paſſage to eſcape, till I
had viewed it in every light of which it was ſuſceptible: though often
diſappointed, I always conſulted the moſt learned or ingenious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators,
Torrentius and Dacier on Horace, Catrou and Servius on
Virgil, Lipſius on Tacitus, Meziriac on Ovid, &amp;c.; and in the ardour
of my inquiries, I embraced a large circle of hiſtorical and critical
erudition. My abſtracts of each book were made in the French
language: my obſervations often branched into particular eſſays; and
I can ſtill read, without contempt, a diſſertation of eight folio pages
on eight lines (287-294) of the fourth Georgic of Virgil. Mr.
Deyverdun, my friend, whoſe name will be frequently repeated,
had joined with equal zeal, though not with equal perſeverance, in
the ſame undertaking. To him every thought, every compoſition,
was inſtantly communicated; with him I enjoyed the benefits of a
free converſation on the topics of our common ſtudies.</p>
            <p>But it is ſcarcely poſſible for a mind endowed with any active cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
to be long converſant with the Latin claſſics, without aſpiring
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0112200701:89"/>
to know the Greek originals, whom they celebrate as their maſters,
and of whom they ſo warmly recommend the ſtudy and imitation;</p>

            <p>It was now that I regretted the early years which had been
waſted in ſickneſs or idleneſs, or mere idle reading; that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the perverſe method of our ſchoolmaſters, who, by firſt
teaching the mother-language, might deſcend with ſo much eaſe and
perſpicuity to the origin and etymology of a derivative idiom. In
the nineteenth year of my age I determined to ſupply this defect;
and the leſſons of Pavilliard again contributed to ſmooth the entrance
of the way, the Greek alphabet, the grammar, and the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
according to the French accent. At my earneſt requeſt we
preſumed to open the Iliad; and I had the pleaſure of beholding,
though darkly and through a glaſs, the true image of Homer, whom
I had long ſince admired in an Engliſh dreſs. After my tutor had left
me to myſelf, I worked my way through about half the Iliad, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
interpreted alone a large portion of Xenophon and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus.
But my ardour, deſtitute of aid and emulation, was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
cooled, and, from the barren taſk of ſearching words in a
lexicon, I withdrew to the free and familiar converſation of Virgil
and Tacitus. Yet in my reſidence at Lauſanne I had laid a ſolid
foundation, which enabled me, in a more propitious ſeaſon, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the ſtudy of Grecian literature.</p>
            <p>From a blind idea of the uſefulneſs of ſuch abſtract ſcience, my
father had been deſirous, and even preſſing, that I ſhould devote
ſome time to the mathematics<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0112200701:90"/>
ſo reaſonable a wiſh. During two winters I attended the private
lectures of Monſieur de Traytorrens, who explained the elements of
algebra and geometry, as far as the conic ſections of the Marquis de
l'Hôpital, and appeared ſatisfied with my diligence and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>JOURNAL, January 1757.]—I began to ſtudy algebra under M. de Traytorrens, went through the elements of algebra and geometry, and the three firſt books of the Marquis de l'Hôpital's Conic Sections. I alſo read Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, Horace (with Dacier's and Torrentius's notes), Virgil, Ovid's Epiſtles, with Meziriac's Commentary, the Ars Amandi, and the Elegies; likewiſe the Auguſtus and Tiberius of Suetonius, and a Latin tranſlation of Dion Caſſius, from the death of Julius Caeſar to the death of Auguſtus. I alſo continued my correſpondence begun laſt year with M. Allemand of Bex, and the Profeſſor Breitinger of Zurich; and opened a new one with the Profeſſor Geſner of Gottingen.</p>
                  <p>N. B. Laſt year and this, I read St. John's Goſpel, with part of Xenophon's Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropoedia; the Iliad, and Herodotus: but, upon the whole, I rather neglected my Greek.</p>
               </note>. But as my childiſh propenſity for numbers and calculations
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0112200701:91"/>
was totally extinct, I was content to receive the paſſive impreſſion
of my Profeſſor's lectures, without any active exerciſe of my own
powers. As ſoon as I underſtood the principles, I relinquiſhed for ever
the purſuit of the mathematics; nor can I lament that I deſiſted,
before my mind was hardened by the habit of rigid demonſtration,
ſo deſtructive of the ſiner feelings of moral evidence, which muſt,
however, determine the actions and opinions of our lives. I liſtened
with more pleaſure to the propoſal of ſtudying the law of nature and
nations, which was taught in the academy of Lauſanne by Mr.
Vicat, a profeſſor of ſome learning and reputation. But, inſtead of
attending his public or private courſe, I preferred in my cloſet the
leſſons of his maſters, and my own reaſon. Without being diſguſted
by Grotius or Puffendorf, I ſtudied in their writings the duties of a
man, the rights of a citizen, the theory of juſtice (it is, alas! a
theory), and the laws of peace and war, which have had ſome influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the practice of modern Europe. My fatigues were alleviated
by the good ſenſe of their commentator Barbeyrac. Locke's Treatiſe
of Government inſtructed me in the knowledge of Whig principles,
which are rather founded in reaſon than experience; but my delight
was in the frequent peruſal of Monteſquieu, whoſe energy of ſtyle,
and boldneſs of hypotheſis, were powerful to awaken and ſtimulate
the genius of the age. The logic of De Crouſaz had prepared me to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0112200701:92"/>
engage with his maſter Locke, and his antagoniſt Bayle; of whom
the former may be uſed as a bridle, and the latter applied as a ſpur,
to the curioſity of a young philoſopher. According to the nature of
their reſpective works, the ſchools of argument and objection, I care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
went through the Eſſay on Human Underſtanding, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
conſulted the moſt intereſting articles of the Philoſophic Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary.
In the infancy of my reaſon I turned over, as an idle
amuſement, the moſt ſerious and important treatiſe: in its maturity,
the moſt trifling performance could exerciſe my taſte or judgment;
and more than once I have been led by a novel into a deep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
train of thinking. But I cannot forbear to mention three
particular books, ſince they may have remotely contributed to form
the hiſtorian of the Roman empire. 1. From the Provincial Letters
of Paſcal, which almoſt every year I have peruſed with new pleaſure,
I learned to manage the weapon of grave and temperate irony, even
on ſubjects of eccleſiaſtical ſolemnity. 2. The Life of Julian, by
the Abbé de la Bleterie, firſt introduced me to the man and the
times; and I ſhould be glad to recover my firſt eſſay on the truth
of the miracle which ſtopped the rebuilding of the Temple of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.
3. In Giannone's Civil Hiſtory of Naples, I obſerved with
a critical eye the progreſs and abuſe of ſacerdotal power, and the
revolutions of Italy in the darker ages. This various reading,
which I now conducted with diſcretion, was digeſted, according to
the precept and model of Mr. Locke, into a large common-place
book; a practice, however, which I do not ſtrenuouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.
The action of the pen will doubtleſs imprint an idea on
the mind as well as on the paper: but I much queſtion whether
the benefits of this laborious method are adequate to the waſte
of time; and I muſt agree with Dr. Johnſon, (Idler, No. 74.)
<q>that what is twice read, is commonly better remembered, than
what is tranſcribed.</q>

During two years, if I forget ſome boyiſh excurſions of a day or a

my father conſented that I ſhould make the tour of Switzerland

Buy a map of Switzerland, it will coſt you but a ſhilling, and follow me. I go by Iverdun, Neufchatel, Bienne or Biel, Soleurre or Solothurn, Bale or Baſil, Bade, Zurich, Lucerne, and Bern. The voyage will be of about four weeks; ſo that <hi>I hope to find a letter from you waiting for me.</hi> As my father had given me leave to learn what I had a mind, I have learned to ride, and learn actually to dance and draw. Beſides that, I often give ten or twelve hours a day to my ſtudies. I find a great many agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people here; ſee them ſometimes, and can ſay upon the whole, without vanity, that though I am the Engliſhman here who ſpends the leaſt money, I am he who is the moſt generally liked. I told you that my father had promiſed to ſend me into France and Italy. I have thanked him for it; but if he would follow my plan, he won't do it yet a while. I never liked young travellers; they go too raw to make and great remarks, and they loſe a time which is (in my opinion) the moſt precious part of a man's life. My ſcheme would be, to ſpend this winter at Lauſanne: for though it is a very good place to acquire the air of good company and the French tongue, we have no good profeſſors. To ſpend (I ſay) the winter at Lauſanne; go into England to ſee my friends a couple of months, and after that, finiſh my ſtudies, either at Cambridge (for after what has paſſed one cannot think of Oxford), or at an univerſity in Holland. If you liked the ſcheme, <hi>could you not propoſe it to my father by Metcalf, or ſomebody</hi> who has <hi>a certain credit over him?</hi> I forgot to aſk you whether, in caſe my father writes to tell me of his marriage, would you adviſe me to compliment my mother-in-law? I think ſo. My health is ſo very regular, that I have nothing to ſay about it.</p>
                        <p>I have been the whole day writing you this letter; the preparations for our voyage gave me a thouſand interruptions. Beſides that, I was obliged to write in Engliſh.

the new proſpects of men and manners; though my converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the natives would have been more free and inſtructive, had
I poſſeſſed the German, as well as the French language. We paſſed
through moſt of the principal towns of Switzerland; Neufchâtel,
Bienne, Soleurre, Arau, Baden, Zurich, Baſil, and Bern. In
every place we viſited the churches, arſenals, libraries, and all the
moſt eminent perſons; and after my return, I digeſted my notes in
fourteen or fifteen ſheets of a French journal, which I diſpatched to
my father, as a proof that my time and his money had not been
miſ-ſpent. Had I found this journal among his papers, I might be
tempted to ſelect ſome paſſages; but I will not tranſcribe the printed
accounts, and it may be ſufficient to notice a remarkable ſpot, which
left a deep and laſting impreſſion on my memory. From Zurich
we proceeded to the Benedictine Abbey of Einfidlen, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſtyled Our Lady of the Hermits. I was aſtoniſhed by the
profuſe oſtentation of riches in the pooreſt corner of Europe; amidſt
a ſavage ſcene of woods and mountains, a palace appears to have
been erected by magic; and it was erected by the potent magic of
religion. A crowd of palmers and votaries was proſtrate before the
altar. The title and worſhip of the Mother of God provoked my
indignation; and the lively naked image of ſuperſtition ſuggeſted
to me, as in the ſame place it had done to Zuinglius, the moſt
preſſing argument for the reformation of the church. About two
years after this tour, I paſſed at Geneva a uſeful and agreeable
month; but this excurſion, and ſome ſhort viſits in the Pais de
Vaud, did not materially interrupt my ſtudious and ſedentary life at
Lauſanne.</p>

My thirſt of improvement, and the languid ſtate of ſcience at
Lauſanne, ſoon prompted me to ſolicit a literary correſpondence
with ſeveral men of learning, whom I had not an opportunity of
perſonally conſulting. 1. In the peruſal of Livy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (xxx. 44.) I had
been ſtopped by a ſentence in a ſpeech of Hannibal, which cannot be
reconciled by any torture with his character or argument. The
commentators diſſemble, or confeſs their perplexity. It occurred to
me, that the change of a ſingle letter, by ſubſtituting <hi>odio</hi> inſtead of
<hi>odio,</hi> might reſtore a clear and conſiſtent ſenſe; but I wiſhed to
weigh my emendation in ſcales leſs partial than my own. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
myſelf to M. Crevier<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Letters, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> I.</note>, the ſucceſſor of Rollin, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
in the univerſity of Paris, who had publiſhed a large and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
edition of Livy. His anſwer was ſpeedy and polite; he
praiſed my ingenuity, and adopted my conjecture. 2. I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Latin correſpondence, at firſt anonymous, and afterwards
in my own name, with Profeſſor Breitinger<note n="†" place="bottom">Ditto, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> IV. and V.</note> of Zurich, the learned
editor of a Septuagint Bible. In our frequent letters we diſcuſſed
many queſtions of antiquity, many paſſages of the Latin claſſics.
I propoſed my interpretations and amendments. His cenſures, for
he did not ſpare my boldneſs of conjecture, were ſharp and ſtrong;
and I was encouraged by the conſciouſneſs of my ſtrength, when
I could ſtand in free debate againſt a critic of ſuch eminence
and erudition. 3. I correſponded on ſimilar topics with the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Profeſſor Matthew Geſner<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ditto, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> VI. VII. and VIII.</note>, of the univerſity of Gottingen;
and he accepted, as courteouſly as the two former, the invitation of
an unknown youth. But his abilities might poſſibly be decayed; his
elaborate letters were feeble and prolix; and when I aſked his proper
direction, the vain old man covered half a ſheet of paper with the
fooliſh enumeration of his titles and offices. 4. Theſe Profeſſors of
Paris, Zurich, and Gottingen, were ſtrangers, whom I preſumed to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0112200701:96"/>
addreſs on the credit of their name; but Mr. Allamand<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Letters, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> II. and III.</note>, Miniſter
at Bex, was my perſonal friend, with whom I maintained a more
free and intereſting correſpondence. He was a maſter of language,
of ſcience, and, above all, of diſpute; and his acute and flexible
logic could ſupport, with equal addreſs, and perhaps with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
the adverſe ſides of every poſſible queſtion. His ſpirit
was active, but his pen had been indolent. Mr. Allamand had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
himſelf to much ſcandal and reproach, by an anonymous letter
(1745) to the Proteſtants of France; in which he labours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
them that <hi>public</hi> worſhip is the excluſive right and duty of the
ſtate, and that their numerous aſſemblies of diſſenters and rebels were
not authoriſed by the law or the goſpel. His ſtyle is animated, his
arguments ſpecious; and if the papiſt may ſeem to lurk under the
maſk of a proteſtant, the philoſopher is concealed under the diſguiſe
of a papiſt. After ſome trials in France and Holland, which were
defeated by his fortune or his character, a genius that might have
enlightened or deluded the world, was buried in a country living,
unknown to fame, and diſcontented with mankind. <hi>Eſt ſacrificulus
in pago, et ruſticos decipit.</hi> As often as private or eccleſiaſtical buſineſs
called him to Lauſanne, I enjoyed the pleaſure and benefit of his
converſation, and we were mutually flattered by our attention to
each other. Our correſpondence, in his abſence, chiefly turned
on Locke's metaphyſics, which he attacked, and I defended; the
origin of ideas, the principles of evidence, and the doctrine of
liberty;
<q>And found no end, in wandering mazes loſt.</q>
By fencing with ſo ſkilful a maſter, I acquired ſome dexterity in the
uſe of my philoſophic weapons; but I was ſtill the ſlave of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and prejudice. He had ſome meaſures to keep; and I much
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0112200701:97"/>
ſuſpect that he never ſhewed me the true colours of his ſecret
ſcepticiſm.</p>
            <p>Before I was recalled from Switzerland, I had the ſatisfaction of
ſeeing the moſt extraordinary man of the age; a poet, an hiſtorian,
a philoſopher, who has filled thirty quartos, of proſe and verſe, with
his various productions, often excellent, and always entertaining.
Need I add the name of Voltaire? After forfeiting, by his own
miſconduct, the friendſhip of the firſt of kings, he retired, at the age
of ſixty, with a plentiful fortune, to a free and beautiful country,
and reſided two winters (1757 and 1758) in the town or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of Lauſanne. My deſire of beholding Voltaire, whom I
then rated above his real magnitude, was eaſily gratified. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me with civility as an Engliſh youth; but I cannot boaſt
of any peculiar notice or diſtinction, <hi>Virgilium vidi tantum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ode which he compoſed on his firſt arrival on the banks of
the Leman Lake, <hi>O Maiſon d' Ariſtippe! O Jardin d'Epicure, &amp;c.</hi>
had been imparted as a ſecret to the gentleman by whom I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.
He allowed me to read it twice; I knew it by heart;
and as my diſcretion was not equal to my memory, the author was
ſoon diſpleaſed by the circulation of a copy. In writing this trivial
anecdote, I wiſhed to obſerve whether my memory was impaired,
and I have the comfort of finding that every line of the poem is
ſtill engraved in freſh and indelible characters. The higheſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
which I derived from Voltaire's reſidence at Lauſanne, was
the uncommon circumſtance of hearing a great poet declaim his own
productions on the ſtage. He had formed a company of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and ladies, ſome of whom were not deſtitute of talents. A
decent theatre was framed at Monrepos, a country-houſe at the end
of a ſuburb; dreſſes and ſcenes were provided at the expence of the
actors; and the author directed the rehearſals with the zeal and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of paternal love. In two ſucceſſive winters his tragedies of
Zayre, Alzire, Zulime, and his ſentimental comedy of the Enfant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0112200701:98"/>
Prodigue, were played at the theatre of Monrepos. Voltaire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
the characters beſt adapted to his years, Luſignan, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varéz,
Benaſſar, Euphemon. His declamation was faſhioned to the
pomp and cadence of the old ſtage; and he expreſſed the enthuſiaſm
of poetry, rather than the feelings of nature. My ardour, which
ſoon became conſpicuous, ſeldom failed of procuring me a ticket.
The habits of pleaſure fortified my taſte for the French theatre, and
that taſte has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic genius of
Shakeſpeare, which is inculcated from our infancy as the firſt duty
of an Engliſhman. The wit and philoſophy of Voltaire, his table
and theatre, refined, in a viſible degree, the manners of Lauſanne;
and, however addicted to ſtudy, I enjoyed my ſhare of the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of ſociety. After the repreſentation of Monrepos I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſupped with the actors. I was now familiar in ſome, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
in many houſes; and my evenings were generally devoted
to cards and converſation, either in private parties or numerous
aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>I heſitate, from the apprehenſion of ridicule, when I approach
the delicate ſubject of my early love. By this word I do not mean
the polite attention, the gallantry, without hope or deſign, which
has originated in the ſpirit of chivalry, and is interwoven with
the texture of French manners. I underſtand by this paſſion the
union of deſire, friendſhip, and tenderneſs, which is inflamed by
a ſingle female, which prefers her to the reſt of her ſex, and which
ſeeks her poſſeſſion as the ſupreme or the ſole happineſs of our
being. I need not bluſh at recollecting the object of my choice;
and though my love was diſappointed of ſucceſs, I am rather proud
that I was once capable of feeling ſuch a pure and exalted ſentiment.
The perſonal attractions of Mademoiſelle Suſan Curchod were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed
by the virtues and talents of the mind. Her fortune was
humble, but her family was reſpectable. Her mother, a native of
France, had preferred her religion to her country. The profeſſion

In the ſolitude of a ſequeſtered village he beſtowed a liberal, and
even learned, education on his only daughter. She ſurpaſſed his
hopes by her proficiency in the ſciences and languages; and in her
ſhort viſits to ſome relations at Lauſanne, the wit, the beauty, and
erudition of Mademoiſelle Curchod were the theme of univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
The report of ſuch a prodigy awakened my curioſity; I
ſaw and loved. I found her learned without pedantry, lively in
converſation, pure in ſentiment, and elegant in manners; and the
firſt ſudden emotion was fortified by the habits and knowledge of
a more familiar acquaintance. She permitted me to make her two
or three viſits at her father's houſe. I paſſed ſome happy days
there, in the mountains of Burgundy, and her parents honourably
encouraged the connection. In a calm retirement the gay vanity of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0112200701:100"/>
youth no longer fluttered in her boſom; ſhe liſtened to the voice
of truth and paſſion, and I might preſume to hope that I had made
ſome impreſſion on a virtuous heart. At Craſſy and Lauſanne I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
my dream of felicity: but on my return to England, I ſoon
diſcovered that my father would not hear of this ſtrange alliance,
and that without his conſent I was myſelf deſtitute and helpleſs.
After a painful ſtruggle I yielded to my fate: I ſighed as a lover, I
obeyed as a ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">See Oeuvres de Rouſſeau, tom. xxxiii. p. 88, 89. octavo edition. As an author I ſhall not appeal from the judgment, or taſte, or caprice of <hi>Jean Jaques:</hi> but that extraordinary man, whom I admire and pity, ſhould have been leſs precipitate in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the moral character and conduct of a ſtranger.</note>; my wound was inſenſibly healed by time, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and the habits of a new life. My cure was accelerated by
a faithful report of the tranquillity and cheerfulneſs of the lady her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and my love ſubſided in friendſhip and eſteem. The miniſter of
Craſſy ſoon afterwards died; his ſtipend died with him: his daughter
retired to Geneva, where, by teaching young ladies, ſhe earned a
hard ſubſiſtence for herſelf and her mother; but in her loweſt
diſtreſs ſhe maintained a ſpotleſs reputation, and a dignified behaviour.
A rich banker of Paris, a citizen of Geneva, had the good fortune
and good ſenſe to diſcover and poſſeſs this ineſtimable treaſure; and
in the capital of taſte and luxury ſhe reſiſted the temptations of
wealth, as ſhe had ſuſtained the hardſhips of indigence. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of her huſband has exalted him to the moſt conſpicuous ſtation
in Europe. In every change of proſperity and diſgrace he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
on the boſom of a faithful friend; and Mademoiſelle Curchod
is now the wife of M. Necker, the miniſter, and perhaps the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator,

remind an Olympic champion that his victory was the conſequence

of his exile; and that at home, like a domeſtic fowl, his days might
have rolled away inactive or inglorious.</p>

ſo liberally improved in the ſtudies and converſation of Lauſanne,
would have been ſteeped in port and prejudice among the monks of
Oxford. Had the fatigue of idleneſs compelled me to read, the
path of learning would not have been enlightened by a ray of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic
freedom. I ſhould have grown to manhood ignorant of
the life and language of Europe, and my knowledge of the world
would have been confined to an Engliſh cloiſter. But my religious
error fixed me at Lauſanne, in a ſtate of baniſhment and diſgrace.
The rigid courſe of diſcipline and abſtinence, to which I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
invigorated the conſtitution of my mind and body; poverty
and pride eſtranged me from my countrymen. One miſchief, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and in their eyes a ſerious and irreparable miſchief, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the ſucceſs of my Swiſs education: I had ceaſed to be an
Engliſhman. At the flexible period of youth, from the age of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
to twenty-one, my opinions, habits, and ſentiments were caſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0112200701:102"/>
in a foreign mould; the faint and diſtant remembrance of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
was almoſt obliterated; my native language was grown leſs
familiar; and I ſhould have cheerfully accepted the offer of a
moderate independence on the terms of perpetual exile. By the
good ſenſe and temper of Pavilliard my yoke was inſenſibly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened:
he left me maſter of my time and actions; but he could
neither change my ſituation, nor increaſe my allowance, and with
the progreſs of my years and reaſon I impatiently ſighed for the
moment of my deliverance. At length, in the Spring of the year
one thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty-eight, my father ſignified his
permiſſion and his pleaſure that I ſhould immediately return home.
We were then in the midſt of a war: the reſentment of the French
at our taking their ſhips without a declaration, had rendered that
polite nation ſomewhat peeviſh and difficult. They denied a paſſage
to Engliſh travellers, and the road through Germany was circuitous,
toilſome, and perhaps in the neighbourhood of the armies, expoſed
to ſome danger. In this perplexity, two Swiſs officers of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in the Dutch ſervice, who were returning to their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
offered to conduct me through France as one of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
nor did we ſufficiently reflect that my borrowed name and
regimentals might have been conſidered, in caſe of a diſcovery, in a
very ſerious light. I took my leave of Lauſanne on the 11th of
April 1758, with a mixture of joy and regret, in the firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reviſiting, as a man, the perſons and places which had been
ſo dear to my youth. We travelled ſlowly, but pleaſantly, in a
hired coach, over the hills of Franche-compté and the fertile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Lorraine, and paſſed, without accident or inquiry, through
ſeveral fortified towns of the French frontier: from thence we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the wild Ardennes of the Auſtrian dutchy of Luxemburg;
and after croſſing the Meuſe at Liege, we traverſed the heaths of
Brabant, and reached, on the fifteenth day, our Dutch garriſon of
Bois le Duc. In our paſſage through Nancy, my eye was gratified
by the aſpect of a regular and beautiful city, the work of Staniſlaus,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0112200701:103"/>
who, after the ſtorms of Poliſh royalty, repoſed in the love and
gratitude of his new ſubjects of Lorraine. In our halt at Maeſtricht
I viſited Mr. de Beaufort, a learned critic, who was known to me by
his ſpecious arguments againſt the five firſt centuries of the Roman
Hiſtory. After dropping my regimental companions, I ſtepped
aſide to viſit Rotterdam and the Hague. I wiſhed to have obſerved
a country, the monument of freedom and induſtry; but my days
were numbered, and a longer delay would have been ungraceful. I
haſtened to embark at the Brill, landed the next day at Harwich,
and proceeded to London, where my father awaited my arrival.
The whole term of my firſt abſence from England was four years
ten months and fifteen days.</p>
            <p>In the prayers of the church our perſonal concerns are judiciouſly
reduced to the threefold diſtinction of <hi>mind, body,</hi> and <hi>eſtate.</hi> The
ſentiments of the mind excite and exerciſe our ſocial ſympathy.
The review of my moral and literary character is the moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to myſelf and to the public; and I may expatiate, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
on my private ſtudies; ſince they have produced the publc
writings, which can alone entitle me to the eſteem and friendſhip of
my readers. The experience of the world inculcates a diſcreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
on the ſubject of our perſon and eſtate, and we ſoon learn
that a free diſcloſure of our riches or poverty would provoke the
malice of envy, or encourage the inſolence of contempt.</p>
            <p>The only perſon in England whom I was impatient to ſee was
my aunt Porten, the affectionate guardian of my tender years. I
haſtened to her houſe in College-ſtreet, Weſtminſter; and the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was ſpent in the effuſions of joy and confidence. It was not
without ſome awe and apprehenſion that I approached the preſence
of my father. My infancy, to ſpeak the truth, had been neglected
at home; the ſeverity of his look and language at our laſt parting
ſtill dwelt on my memory; nor could I form any notion of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
or my probable reception. They were both more agreeable
than I could expect. The domeſtic diſcipline of our anceſtors has
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0112200701:104"/>
been relaxed by the philoſophy and ſoftneſs of the age; and if my
father remembered that he had trembled before a ſtern parent, it was
only to adopt with his own ſon an oppoſite mode of behaviour.
He received me as a man and a friend; all conſtraint was baniſhed
at our firſt interview, and we ever afterwards continued on the ſame
terms of eaſy and equal politeneſs. He applauded the ſucceſs of
my education; every word and action was expreſſive of the moſt
cordial affection; and our lives would have paſſed without a cloud,
if his oeconomy had been equal to his fortune, or if his fortune had
been equal to his deſires. During my abſence he had married his
ſecond wife, Miſs Dorothea Patton, who was introduced to me with
the moſt unfavourable prejudice. I conſidered his ſecond marriage
as an act of diſpleaſure, and I was diſpoſed to hate the rival of my
mother. But the injuſtice was in my own fancy, and the imaginary
monſter was an amiable and deſerving woman. I could not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in the firſt view of her underſtanding, her knowledge, and
the elegant ſpirit of her converſation: her polite welcome, and her
aſſiduous care to ſtudy and gratify my wiſhes, announced at leaſt
that the ſurface would be ſmooth; and my ſuſpicions of art and
falſehood were gradually diſpelled by the full diſcovery of her warm
and exquiſite ſenſibility. After ſome reſerve on my ſide, our minds
aſſociated in confidence and friendſhip; and as Mrs. Gibbon had
neither children nor the hopes of children, we more eaſily adopted
the tender names and genuine characters of mother and of ſon.
By the indulgence of theſe parents, I was left at liberty to conſult
my taſte or reaſon in the choice of place, of company, and of
amuſements; and my excurſions were bounded only by the limits
of the iſland, and the meaſure of my income. Some faint efforts
were made to procure me the employment of ſecretary to a foreign
embaſſy; and I liſtened to a ſcheme which would again have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
me to the continent. Mrs. Gibbon, with ſeeming wiſdom,
exhorted me to take chambers in the Temple, and devote my leiſure
to the ſtudy of the law. I cannot repent of having neglected her
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0112200701:105"/>
advice. Few men, without the ſpur of neceſſity, have reſolution
to force their way through the thorns and thickets of that gloomy
labyrinth. Nature had not endowed me with the bold and ready
eloquence which makes itſelf heard amidſt the tumult of the bar;
and I ſhould probably have been diverted from the labours of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
without acquiring the fame or fortune of a ſucceſsful pleader.
I had no need to call to my aid the regular duties of a profeſſion;
every day, every hour, was agreeably filled; nor have I known,
like ſo many of my countrymen, the tediouſneſs of an idle life.</p>
            <p>Of the two years (May 1758—May 1760,) between my return
to England and the embodying of the Hampſhire militia, I paſſed
about nine months in London, and the remainder in the country.
The metropolis affords many amuſements, which are open to all.
It is itſelf an aſtoniſhing and perpetual ſpectacle to the curious eye;
and each taſte, each ſenſe may be gratified by the variety of objects
which will occur in the long circuit of a morning walk. I aſſiduouſly
frequented the theatres at a very propitious aera of the ſtage, when
a conſtellation of excellent actors, both in tragedy and comedy, was
eclipſed by the meridian brightneſs of Garrick in the maturity of
his judgement, and vigour of his performance. The pleaſures of a
town-life are within the reach of every man who is regardleſs of his
health, his money, and his company. By the contagion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
I was ſometimes ſeduced; but the better habits, which I had
formed at Lauſanne, induced me to ſeek a more elegant and rational
ſociety; and if my ſearch was leſs eaſy and ſucceſsful than I might
have hoped, I ſhall at preſent impute the failure to the diſadvantages
of my ſituation and character. Had the rank and fortune of my
parents given them an annual eſtabliſhment in London, their own
houſe would have introduced me to a numerous and polite circle of
acquaintance. But my father's taſte had always preferred the higheſt
and the loweſt company, for which he was equally qualified; and after
a twelve years retirement, he was no longer in the memory of the
great with whom he had aſſociated. I found myſelf a ſtranger in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0112200701:106"/>
the midſt of a vaſt and unknown city; and at my entrance into life
I was reduced to ſome dull family parties, and ſome ſcattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections,
which were not ſuch as I ſhould have choſen for myſelf.
The moſt uſeful friends of my father were the Mallets: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me with civility and kindneſs at firſt on his account, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
on my own; and (if I may uſe Lord Cheſterfield's words)
I was ſoon <hi>domeſticated</hi> in their houſe. Mr. Mallet, a name among
the Engliſh poets, is praiſed by an unforgiving enemy, for the eaſe
and elegance of his converſation, and his wife was not deſtitute of
wit or learning. By his aſſiſtance I was introduced to lady Hervey,
the mother of the preſent earl of Briſtol. Her age and infirmities
confined her at home; her dinners were ſelect; in the evening her
houſe was open to the beſt company of both ſexes and all nations;
nor was I diſpleaſed at her preference and affectation of the manners,
the language, and the literature of France. But my progreſs in the
Engliſh world was in general left to my own efforts, and thoſe efforts
were languid and ſlow. I had not been endowed by art or nature
with thoſe happy gifts of confidence and addreſs, which unlock
every door and every boſom; nor would it be reaſonable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the juſt conſequences of my ſickly childhood, foreign edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and reſerved temper. While coaches were rattling through
Bond-ſtreet, I have paſſed many a ſolitary evening in my lodging
with my books. My ſtudies were ſometimes interrupted by a ſigh,
which I breathed towards Lauſanne; and on the approach of Spring,
I withdrew without reluctance from the noiſy and extenſive ſcene
of crowds without company, and diſſipation without pleaſure. In
each of the twenty-five years of my acquaintance with London
(1758—1783) the proſpect gradually brightened; and this unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
picture moſt properly belongs to the firſt period after my
return from Switzerland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0112200701:107"/>
My father's reſidence in Hampſhire, where I have paſſed many
light, and ſome heavy hours, was at Buriton, near Petersſield, one
mile from the Portſmouth road, and at the eaſy diſtance of fifty-eight
miles from London<note n="*" place="bottom">The eſtate and maner of Beriton, otherwiſe Buriton, were conſiderable, and were ſold a few years ago to Lord Stawell. S.</note> An old manſion, in a ſtate of decay,
had been converted into the faſhion and convenience of a modern
houſe: and if ſtrangers had nothing to ſee, the inhabitants had little
to deſire. The ſpot was not happily choſen, at the end of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
and the bottom of the hill: but the aſpect of the adjacent
grounds was various and cheerful; the downs commanded a noble
proſpect, and the long hanging woods in ſight of the houſe could
not perhaps have been improved by art or expence. My father
kept in his own hands the whole of the eſtate, and even rented
ſome additional land; and whatſoever might be the balance of profit
and loſs, the farm ſupplied him with amuſement and plenty. The
produce maintained a number of men and horſes, which were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
by the intermixture of domeſtic and rural ſervants; and in
the intervals of labour the favourite team, a handſome ſet of bays
or greys, was harneſſed to the coach. The oeconomy of the houſe
was regulated by the taſte and prudence of Mrs. Gibbon. She
prided herſelf in the elegance of her occaſional dinners; and from
the uncleanly avarice of Madame Pavilliard, I was ſuddenly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to the daily neatneſs and luxury of an Engliſh table. Our
immediate neighbourhood was rare and ruſtic; but from the verge of
our hills, as far as Chicheſter and Goodwood, the weſtern diſtrict of
Suſſex was interſperſed with noble ſeats and hoſpitable families, with
whom we cultivated a friendly, and might have enjoyed a very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
intercourſe. As my ſtay at Buriton was always voluntary, I
was received and diſmiſſed with ſmilies; but the comforts of my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did not depend on the ordinary pleaſures of the country. My
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0112200701:108"/>
father could never inſpire me with his love and knowledge of farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I never handled a gun, I ſeldom mounted an horſe; and
my philoſophic walks were ſoon terminated by a ſhady bench, where
I was long detained by the ſedentary amuſement of reading or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.
At home I occupied a pleaſant and ſpacious apartment;
the library on the ſame floor was ſoon conſidered as my peculiar do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
and I might ſay with truth, that I was never leſs alone than
when by myſelf. My ſole complaint, which I piouſly ſuppreſſed,
aroſe from the kind reſtraint impoſed on the freedom of my time.
By the habit of early riſing I always ſecured a ſacred portion of the
day, and many ſcattered moments were ſtolen and employed by my
ſtudious induſtry. But the family hours of breakfaſt, of dinner,
of tea, and of ſupper, were regular and long; after breakfaſt Mrs.
Gibbon expected my company in her dreſſing-room; after tea my
father claimed my converſation and the peruſal of the newſpapers;
and in the midſt of an intereſting work I was often called down to
receive the viſit of ſome idle neighbours. Their dinners and viſits
required, in due ſeaſon, a ſimilar return; and I dreaded the period
of the full moon, which was uſually reſerved for our more diſtant
excurſions. I could not refuſe attending my father, in the ſummer
of 1759, to the races at Stockbridge, Reading, and Odiam, where
he had entered a horſe for the hunter's plate; and I was not
diſpleaſed with the ſight of our Olympic games, the beauty of
the ſpot, the fleetneſs of the horſes, and the gay tumult of the
numerous ſpectators. As ſoon as the militia buſineſs was agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
many days were tediouſly conſumed in meetings of deputy-lieutenants
at Petersfield, Alton, and Wincheſter. In the cloſe of
the ſame year, 1759, Sir Simeon (then Mr.) Stewart attempted
an unſucceſsful conteſt for the county of Southampton, againſt
Mr. Legge, Chancellor of the Exchequer: a well-known conteſt,
in which Lord Bute's influence was firſt exerted and cenſured.
Our canvas at Portſmouth and Goſport laſted ſeveral days; but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0112200701:109"/>
the interruption of my ſtudies was compenſated in ſome degree by
the ſpectacle of Engliſh manners, and the acquiſition of ſome prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
knowledge.</p>
            <p>If in a more domeſtic or more diſſipated ſcene my application was
ſomewhat relaxed, the love of knowledge was inflamed and gratified
by the command of books; and I compared the poverty of Lauſanne
with the plenty of London. My father's ſtudy at Buriton was
ſtuffed with much traſh of the laſt age, with much high church
divinity and politics, which have long ſince gone to their proper
place: yet it contained ſome valuable editions of the claſſics and the
fathers, the choice, as it ſhould ſeem, of Mr. Law; and many
Engliſh publications of the times had been occaſionally added.
From this ſlender beginning I have gradually formed a numerous
and ſelect library, the foundation of my works, and the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of my life, both at home and abroad. On the receipt of the
firſt quarter, a large ſhare of my allowance was appropriated to my
literary wants. I cannot forget the joy with which I exchanged
a bank-note of twenty pounds for the twenty volumes of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
of the Academy of Inſcriptions; nor would it have been eaſy,
by any other expenditure of the ſame ſum, to have procured ſo large
and laſting a fund of rational amuſement. At a time when I moſt
aſſiduouſly frequented this ſchool of antient literature, I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
my opinion of a learned and various collection, which ſince
the year 1759 has been doubled in magnitude, though not in merit—
<q>Une de ces ſocietés, qui ont mieux immortaliſé Louis XIV. qu'un
ambition ſouvent pernicieuſe aux hommes, commençoit deja ces
recherches qui réuniſſent la juſteſſe de l'eſprit, l'ameneté &amp; l'eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
où l'on voit tant des dècouvertes, et quelquefois, ce qui
ne cede qu'à peine aux decouvertes, une <hi>ignorance</hi> modeſte et
<hi>ſavante.</hi>
               </q> The review of my library muſt be reſerved for the
period of its maturity; but in this place I may allow myſelf to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that I am not conſcious of having ever bought a book from a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0112200701:110"/>
motive of oſtentation, that every volume, before it was depoſited on
the ſhelf, was either read or ſufficiently examined, and that I ſoon
adopted the tolerating maxim of the elder Pliny, <q>nullum eſſe
librum tam malum ut non ex aliquâ parte prodeſſet.</q> I could not
yet find leiſure or courage to renew the purſuit of the Greek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
excepting by reading the leſſons of the Old and New Teſtament
every Sunday, when I attended the family to church. The ſeries of
my Latin authors was leſs ſtrenuouſly completed; but the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by inheritance or purchaſe, of the beſt editions of Cicero,
Quintilian, Livy, Tacitus, Ovid, &amp;c. afforded a fair proſpect, which
I ſeldom neglected. I perſevered in the uſeful method of abſtracts
and obſervations; and a ſingle example may ſuffice, of a note which
had almoſt ſwelled into a work. The ſolution of a paſſage of Livy
(xxxviii. 38.) involved me in the dry and dark treatiſes of Greaves,
Arbuthnot, Hooper, Bernard, Eiſenſchmidt, Gronovius, La Barré,
Freret,  and in my French eſſay (chap. 20.) I ridiculouſly ſend
the reader to my own <hi>manuſcript</hi> remarks on the weights, coins, and
meaſures of the ancients, which were abruptly terminated by the
militia drum.</p>
            <p>As I am now entering on a more ample field of ſociety and
ſtudy, I can only hope to avoid a vain and prolix garrulity, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
the vulgar crowd of my acquaintance, and confining myſelf
to ſuch intimate friends among books and men, as are beſt entitled to
my notice by their own merit and reputation, or by the deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which they have left on my mind. Yet I will embrace this
occaſion of recommending to the young ſtudent a practice, which
about this time I myſelf adopted. After glancing my eye over the
deſign and order of a new book, I ſuſpended the peruſal till I had
finiſhed the taſk of ſelf-examination, till I had revolved, in a ſolitary
walk, all that I knew or believed, or had thought on the ſubject
of the whole work, or of ſome particular chapter: I was then quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to diſcern how much the author added to my original ſtock; and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0112200701:111"/>
I was ſometimes ſatisfied by the agreement, I was ſometimes armed
by the oppoſition, of our ideas. The favourite companions of my
leiſure were our Engliſh writers ſince the Revolution: they breathe
the ſpirit of reaſon and liberty; and they moſt ſeaſonably contributed
to reſtore the purity of my own language, which had been corrupted
by the long uſe of a foreign idiom. By the judicious advice of Mr.
Mallet, I was directed to the writings of Swift and Addiſon; wit and
ſimplicity are their common attributes: but the ſtyle of Swift is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by manly original vigour; that of Addiſon is adorned by the
female graces of elegance and mildneſs. The old reproach, that no
Britiſh altars had been raiſed to the muſe of hiſtory, was recently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the firſt performances of Robertſon and Hume, the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of Scotland and of the Stuarts. I will aſſume the preſumption
of ſaying, that I was not unworthy to read them: nor will I diſguiſe
my different feelings in the repeated peruſals. The perfect compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the nervous language, the well-turned periods of Dr. Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
inflamed me to the ambitious hope that I might one day tread
in his footſteps: the calm philoſophy, the careleſs inimitable beauties
of his friend and rival, often forced me to cloſe the volume with a
mixed ſenſation of delight and deſpair.</p>
            <p>The deſign of my firſt work, the Eſſay on the Study of Literature,
was ſuggeſted by a refinement of vanity, the deſire of juſtifying and
praiſing the object of a favourite purſuit. In France, to which my
ideas were confined, the learning and language of Greece and Rome
were neglected by a philoſophic age. The guardian of thoſe ſtudies,
the Academy of Inſcriptions, was degraded to the loweſt rank among
the three royal ſocieties of Paris: the new appellation of Erudits
was contemptuouſly applied to the ſucceſſors of Lipſius and Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon;
and I was provoked to hear (ſee M. d'Alembert Diſcours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaire
à l'Encyclopedie) that the exerciſe of the memory, their
ſole merit, had been ſuperſeded by the nobler faculties of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and the judgment. I was ambitious of proving by my own
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0112200701:112"/>
example, as well as by my precepts, that all the faculties of the mind
may be exerciſed and diſplayed by the ſtudy of ancient literature: I
began to ſelect and adorn the various proofs and illuſtrations which
had offered themſelves in reading the claſſics; and the firſt pages or
chapters of my eſſay were compoſed before my departure from
Lauſanne. The hurry of the journey, and of the firſt weeks of my
Engliſh life, ſuſpended all thoughts of ſerious application: but my
object was ever before my eyes; and no more than ten days, from
the firſt to the eleventh of July, were ſuffered to elapſe after my
ſummer eſtabliſhment at Buriton. My eſſay was finiſhed in about
ſix weeks; and as ſoon as a fair copy had been tranſcribed by one of
the French priſoners at Petersſield, I looked round for a critic and
judge of my firſt performance. A writer can ſeldom be content with
the doubtful recompence of ſolitary approbation; but a youth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the world, and of himſelf, muſt deſire to weigh his talents in
ſome ſcales leſs partial than his own: my conduct was natural, my
motive laudable, my choice of Dr. Maty judicious and fortunate.
By deſcent and education Dr. Maty, though born in Holland, might
be conſidered as a Frenchman; but he was fixed in London by the
practice of phyſic, and an office in the Britiſh Muſeum. His repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was juſtly founded on the eighteen volumes of the <hi>Journal
Britannique,</hi> which he had ſupported, almoſt alone, with perſeverance
and ſucceſs. This humble though uſeful labour, which had once
been digniſied by the genius of Bayle and the learning of Le Clerc,
was not diſgraced by the taſte, the knowledge, and the judgment of
Maty: he exhibits a candid and pleaſing view of the ſtate of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in England during a period of ſix years (January 1750—De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
1755); and, far different from his angry ſon, he handles the
rod of criticiſm with the tenderneſs and reluctance of a parent. The
author of the <hi>Journal Britannique</hi> ſometimes aſpires to the character
of a poet and philoſopher: his ſtyle is pure and elegant; and in his
virtues, or even in his defects, he may be ranked as one of the laſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0112200701:113"/>
diſciples of the ſchool of Fontenelle. His anſwer to my firſt letter
was prompt and polite: after a careful examination he returned my
manuſcript, with ſome animadverſion and much applauſe; and when
I viſited London in the enſuing winter, we diſcuſſed the deſign and
execution in ſeveral free and familiar converſations. In a ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion
to Buriton I reviewed my eſſay, according to his friendly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and after ſuppreſſing a third, adding a third, and altering a
third, I conſummated my firſt labour by a ſhort preface, which is
dated February 3d, 1759. Yet I ſtill ſhrunk from the preſs with
the terrors of virgin modeſty: the manuſcript was ſafely depoſited in
my deſk; and as my attention was engaged by new objects, the
delay might have been prolonged till I had fulfilled the precept of
Horace, <q>nonumque prematur in annum.</q> Father Sirmond, a
learned jeſuit, was ſtill more rigid, ſince he adviſed a young friend
to expect the mature age of fifty, before he gave himſelf or his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the public (Olivet Hiſtoire de l'Academie Françoiſe, tom. ii.
p. 143.). The counſel was ſingular; but it is ſtill more ſingular that
it ſhould have been approved by the example of the author. Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
was himſelf fifty-five years of age when he publiſhed (in 1614)
his firſt work, an edition of Sidonius Apollinaris, with many valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>Two years elapſed in ſilence: but in the ſpring of 1761 I yielded
to the authority of a parent, and complied, like a pious ſon, with
the wiſh of my own heart<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>JOURNAL, March 8th, 1758.]—I began my Eſſai ſur l'Étude de la Litterature, and wrote the 23 firſt chapters (excepting the following ones, 11, 12, 13. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.) before I left Switzerland.</p>
                  <p>July 11th. I again took in hand my Eſſay; and in about ſix weeks finiſhed it, from C. 23—55. (excepting 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. and note to C. 38.) beſides a number of chapters from C. 55. to the end, which are now ſtruck out.</p>
                  <p>Feb. 11th, 1759. I wrote the chapters of my Eſſay, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. the note to C. 38. and the firſt part of the preface.</p>
                  <p>April 23d, 1761. Being at length, by my father's advice, determined to publiſh my Eſſay, I reviſed it with great care, made many alterations, ſtruck out a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part, and wrote the chapters from 57—78, which I was obliged myſelf to copy out fair.</p>
                  <p>June 10th, 1761. Finding the printing of my book proceeded but ſlowly, I went up to town, where I found the whole was finiſhed. I gave Becket orders for the preſents: 20 for Lauſanne; copies for the Duke of Richmond, Marquis of Carnarvon, Lords Waldegrave, Litchfield, Bath, Granville, Bute, Shelbourn, Cheſterfield, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke, Lady Hervey, Sir Joſeph Yorke, Sir Matthew Featherſtone, M. M. Mallet, Maty, Scott, Wray, Lord Egremont, M. de Buſſy, Mademoiſelle la Ducheſſe d'Aguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and M. le Comte de Caylus:—great part of theſe were only my father's or Mallet's acquaintance.</p>
               </note>. My private reſolves were influenced
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0112200701:114"/>
by the ſtate of Europe. About this time the belligerent powers had
made and accepted overtures of peace; our Engliſh plenipotentiaries
were named to aſſiſt at the Congreſs of Augſbourg, which never met:
I wiſhed to attend them as a gentleman or a ſecretary; and my father
fondly believed that the proof of ſome literary talents might introduce
me to public notice, and ſecond the recommendations of my friends.
After a laſt reviſal I conſulted with Mr. Mallet and Dr. Maty, who
approved the deſign and promoted the execution. Mr. Mallet, after
hearing me read my manuſcript, received it from my hands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it into thoſe of Becket, with whom he made an agreement in
my name; an eaſy agreement: I required only a certain number of
copies; and, without transferring my property, I devolved on the
bookſeller the charges and profits of the edition. Dr. Maty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
in my abſence, to correct the ſheets: he inſerted, without my
knowledge, an elegant and flattering epiſtle to the author; which is
compoſed, however, with ſo much art, that, in caſe of a defeat, his
favourable report might have been aſcribed to the indulgence of a
friend for the raſh attempt of a <hi>young Engliſh</hi> gentleman. The
work was printed and publiſhed, under the title of Eſſai ſur l'Étude
de la Litterature, à Londres, chez T. Becket et P. A. de Hondt, 1761,
in a ſmall volume in duodecimo: my dedication to my father, a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0112200701:115"/>
proper and pious addreſs, was compoſed the twenty-eighth of May:
Dr. Maty's letter is dated the 16th of June; and I received the firſt
copy (June 23d) at Alresford, two days before I marched with the
Hampſhire militia. Some weeks afterwards, on the ſame ground, I
preſented my book to the late Duke of York, who breakfaſted in
Colonel Pitt's tent. By my father's direction, and Mallet's advice,
many literary gifts were diſtributed to ſeveral eminent characters in
England and France; two books were ſent to the Count de Caylus,
and the Ducheſſe d'Aiguillon, at Paris: I had reſerved twenty copies
for my friends at Lauſanne, as the firſt fruits of my education, and
a grateful token of my remembrance: and on all theſe perſons I
levied an unavoidable tax of civility and compliment. It is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
that a work, of which the ſtyle and ſentiments were ſo totally
foreign, ſhould have been more ſucceſsful abroad than at home. I
was delighted by the copious extracts, the warm commendations,
and the flattering predictions of the Journals of France and Holland:
and the next year (1762) a new edition (I believe at Geneva) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the fame, or at leaſt the circulation, of the work. In England
it was received with cold indifference, little read, and ſpeedily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
a ſmall impreſſion was ſlowly diſperſed; the bookſeller mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured,
and the author (had his feelings been more exquiſite) might
have wept over the blunders and baldneſs of the Engliſh tranſlation.
The publication of my Hiſtory fifteen years afterwards revived the
memory of my firſt performance, and the Eſſay was eagerly ſought
in the ſhops. But I refuſed the permiſſion which Becket ſolicited of
reprinting it: the public curioſity was imperfectly ſatisfied by a
pirated copy of the bookſellers of Dublin; and when a copy of the
original edition has been diſcovered in a ſale, the primitive value of
half-a-crown has riſen to the fanciful price of a guinea or thirty
ſhillings.</p>
            <p>I have expatiated on the petty circumſtances and period of my
firſt publication, a memorable aera in the life of a ſtudent, when he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0112200701:116"/>
ventures to reveal the meaſure of his mind: his hopes and fears are
multiplied by the idea of ſelf-importance, and he believes for a while
that the eyes of mankind are ſixed on his perſon and performance.
Whatever may be my preſent reputation, it no longer reſts on the
merit of this firſt eſſay; and at the end of twenty-eight years I may
appreciate my juvenile work with the impartiality, and almoſt with
the indifference, of a ſtranger. In his anſwer to Lady Hervey, the
Count de Caylus admires, or affects to admire, <q>les livres ſans
nombre que Mr. Gibbon a lus et tres bien lus<note n="*" place="bottom"> See Appendix, Letter, No. X.</note>
               </q>. But, alas! my
ſtock of erudition at that time was ſcanty and ſuperficial; and if I
allow myſelf the liberty of naming the Greek maſters, my genuine
and perſonal acquaintance was conſined to the Latin claſſics. The
moſt ſerious defect of my Eſſay is a kind of obſcurity and abruptneſs
which always fatigues, and may often elude, the attention of the
reader. Inſtead of a preciſe and proper definition of the title itſelf,
the ſenſe of the word <hi>Litterature</hi> is looſely and variouſly applied: a
number of remarks and examples, hiſtorical, critical, philoſophical,
are heaped on each other without method or connection; and if we
except ſome introductory pages, all the remaining chapters might
indifferently be reverſed or tranſpoſed. The obſcurity of many
paſſages is often affected, <hi>brevis eſſe laboro, obſcurus fio;</hi> the deſire
of expreſſing perhaps a common idea with ſententious and oracular
brevity: alas! how fatal has been the imitation of Monteſquieu!
But this obſcurity ſometimes proceeds from a mixture of light and
darkneſs in the author's mind; from a partial ray which ſtrikes upon
an angle, inſtead of ſpreading itſelf over the ſurface of an object.
After this fair confeſſion I ſhall preſume to ſay, that the Eſſay does
credit to a young writer of two and twenty years of age, who had
read with taſte, who thinks with freedom, and who writes in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
language with ſpirit and elegance. The defence of the early
Hiſtory of Rome and the new Chronology of Sir Iſaac Newton
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0112200701:117"/>
form a ſpecious argument. The patriotic and political deſign of the
Georgies is happily conceived; and any probable conjecture, which
tends to raiſe the dignity of the poet and the poem, deſerves to be
adopted, without a rigid ſcrutiny. Some dawnings of a philoſophic
ſpirit enlighten the general remarks on the ſtudy of hiſtory and of
man. I am not diſpleaſed with the inquiry into the origin and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the gods of polytheiſm, which might deſerve the illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a riper judgment. Upon the whole, I may apply to the
firſt labour of my pen the ſpeech of a far ſuperior artiſt, when he
ſurveyed the firſt productions of his pencil. After viewing ſome
portraits which he had painted in his youth, my friend Sir Joſhua
Reynolds acknowledged to me, that he was rather humbled than
flattered by the compariſon with his preſent works; and that after
ſo much time and ſtudy, he had conceived his improvement to be
much greater than he found it to have been.</p>
            <p>At Lauſanne I compoſed the firſt chapters of my Eſſay in French,
the familiar language of my converſation and ſtudies, in which it
was eaſier for me to write than in my mother-tongue. After my
return to England I continued the ſame practice, without any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,
or deſign of repudiating (as Dr. Bentley would ſay) my
vernacular idiom. But I ſhould have eſcaped ſome Anti-gallican
clamour, had I been content with the more natural character of an
Engliſh author. I ſhould have been more conſiſtent had I rejected
Mallet's advice, of prefixing an Engliſh dedication to a French book;
a confuſion of tongues that ſeemed to accuſe the ignorance of my
patron. The uſe of a foreign dialect might be excuſed by the hope
of being employed as a negociator, by the deſire of being generally
underſtood on the continent; but my true motive was doubtleſs the
ambition of new and ſingular fame, an Engliſhman claiming a place
among the writers of France. The Latin tongue had been conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
by the ſervice of the church, it was refined by the imitation of
the ancients; and in the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries the ſcholars
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0112200701:118"/>
of Europe enjoyed the advantage, which they have gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
of converſing and writing in a common and learned idiom.
As that idiom was no longer in any country the vulgar ſpeech, they
all ſtood on a level with each other; yet a citizen of old Rome
might have ſmiled at the beſt Latinity of the Germans and Britons;
and we may learn from the <hi>Ciceronianus</hi> of Eraſmus, how difficult it
was found to ſteer a middle courſe between pedantry and barbariſm.
The Romans themſelves had ſometimes attempted a more perilous
taſk, of writing in a living language, and appealing to the taſte and
judgment of the natives. The vanity of Tully was doubly intereſted
in the Greek memoirs of his own conſulſhip; and if he modeſtly
ſuppoſes that ſome Latiniſms might be detected in his ſtyle, he is
confident of his own ſkill in the art of Iſocrates and Ariſtotle;
and he requeſts his friend Atticus to diſperſe the copies of his work
at Athens, and in the other cities of Greece, (<hi>ad Atticum,</hi> i. 19. ii. 1.)
But it muſt not be forgotten, that from infancy to manhood Cicero
and his contemporaries had read and declaimed, and compoſed with
equal diligence in both languages; and that he was not allowed to
frequent a Latin ſchool till he had imbibed the leſſons of the Greek
grammarians and rhetoricians. In modern times, the language of
France has been diffuſed by the merit of her writers, the ſocial
manners of the natives, the influence of the monarchy, and the
exile of the proteſtants. Several foreigners have ſeized the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſpeaking to Europe in this common dialect, and Germany
may plead the authority of Leibnitz and Frederic, of the firſt of her
philoſophers, and the greateſt of her kings. The juſt pride and
laudable prejudice of England has reſtrained this communication of
idioms; and of all the nations on this ſide of the Alps, my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are the leaſt practiſed, and leaſt perfect in the exerciſe of the
French tongue. By Sir William Temple and Lord Cheſterfield it was
only uſed on occaſions of civility and buſineſs, and their printed letters
will not be quoted as models of compoſition. Lord Bolingbroke may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0112200701:119"/>
have publiſhed in French a ſketch of his Reflections on Exile: but his
reputation now repoſes on the addreſs of Voltaire, <q>Docte ſermones
utriuſque linguae;</q> and by his Engliſh dedication to Queen Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
and his Eſſay on Epic Poetry, it ſhould ſeem that Voltaire himſelf
wiſhed to deſerve a return of the ſame compliment. The exception
of Count Hamilton cannot fairly be urged; though an Iriſhman by
birth, he was educated in France from his childhood. Yet I am
ſurpriſed that a long reſidence in England, and the habits of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
converſation, did not affect the eaſe and purity of his inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſtyle; and I regret the omiſſion of his Engliſh verſes, which
might have afforded an amuſing object of compariſon. I might
therefore aſſume the <hi>primus ego in patriam, &amp;c.;</hi> but with what ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
I have explored this untrodden path muſt be left to the deciſion
of my French readers. Dr. Maty, who might himſelf be queſtioned
as a foreigner, has ſecured his retreat at my expence. <q>Je ne crois
pas que vous vous piquiez d'être moins facile à reconnoitre pour un
Anglois que Lucullus pour un Romain.</q> My friends at Paris have
been more indulgent, they received me as a countryman, or at leaſt
as a provincial; but they were friends and Pariſians<note n="*" place="bottom">The copious extracts which were given in the <hi>Journal Etranger</hi> by Mr. Suard, a judicious critic, muſt ſatisfy both the author and the public. I may here obſerve, that I have never ſeen in any literary review a tolerable account of my Hiſtory. The manufacture of journals, at leaſt on the continent, is miſerably debaſed.</note>. The defects
which Maty inſinuates, <q>Ces traits ſaillans, ces figures hardies, ce
ſacrifice de la régle au ſentiment, et de la cadence à la force,</q> are
the faults of the youth, rather than of the ſtranger: and after the
long and laborious exerciſe of my own language, I am conſcious
that my French ſtyle has been ripened and improved.</p>
            <p>I have already hinted, that the publication of my Eſſay was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
till I had embraced the military profeſſion. I ſhall now amuſe
myſelf with the recollection of an active ſcene, which bears no
affinity to any other period of my ſtudious and ſocial life.</p>

In the outſet of a glorious war, the Engliſh people had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by the aid of German mercenaries. A national militia has
been the cry of every patriot ſince the Revolution; and this meaſure,
both in parliament and in the field, was ſupported by the country
gentlemen or Tories, who inſenſibly transferred their loyalty to the
houſe of Hanover: in the language of Mr. Burke, they have changed
the idol, but they have preſerved the idolatry. In the act of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our names and receiving our commiſſions, as major and captain
in the Hampſhire regiment, (June 12th, 1759,) we had not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that we ſhould be dragged away, my father from his farm,
myſelf from my books, and condemned, during two years and a half,
(May 10, 1760—December 23, 1762,) to a wandering life of military
ſervitude. But a weekly or monthly exerciſe of thirty thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials
would have left them uſeleſs and ridiculous; and after the
pretence of an invaſion had vaniſhed, the popularity of Mr. Pitt gave
a ſanction to the illegal ſtep of keeping them till the end of the war
under arms, in conſtant pay and duty, and at a diſtance from their
reſpective homes. When the King's order for our embodying came
down, it was too late to retreat, and too ſoon to repent. The South
battalion of the Hampſhire militia was a ſmall independent corps of
four hundred and ſeventy-ſix, officers and men, commanded by
lieutenant-colonel Sir Thomas Worſley, who, after a prolix and
paſſionate conteſt, delivered us from the tyranny of the lord lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Duke of Bolton. My proper ſtation, as firſt captain, was
at the head of my own, and afterwards of the grenadier, company;
but in the abſence, or even in the preſence, of the two field officers,
I was entruſted by my friend and my father with the effective labour
of dictatig the orders, and exerciſing the battalion. With the help
of our original journal, I could write the hiſtory of my bloodleſs
and inglorious campaigns; but as theſe events have loſt much of
their importance in my own eyes, they ſhall be diſpatched in a few
words. From Wincheſter, the firſt place of aſſembly, (June 4, 1760,)
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0112200701:121"/>
we were removed, at our own requeſt, for the benefit of a foreign
education. By the arbitrary, and often capricious, orders of the
War-office, the battalion ſucceſſively marched to the pleaſant and
hoſpitable Blandford (June 17); to Hilſea barracks, a ſeat of diſeaſe
and diſcord (September 1); to Cranbrook in the weald of Kent
(December 11); to the ſea-coaſt of Dover (December 27); to Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter
camp (June 25, 1761); to the populous and diſorderly town
of Devizes (October 23); to Saliſbury (February 28, 1762); to our
beloved Blandford a ſecond time (March 9); and finally, to the
faſhionable reſort of Southampton (June 2); where the colours were
fixed till our final diſſolution (December 23). On the beach at
Dover we had exerciſed in ſight of the Gallic ſhores. But the moſt
ſplendid and uſeful ſcene of our life was a four months encampment
on Wincheſter Down, under the command of the Earl of Effing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
Our army conſiſted of the thirty-fourth regiment of foot
and ſix militia corps. The conſciouſneſs of our defects was ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by friendly emulation. We improved our time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
in morning and evening field-days; and in the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views
the South Hampſhire were rather a credit than a diſgrace to
the line. In our ſubſequent quarters of the Devizes and Blandford,
we advanced with a quick ſtep in our military ſtudies; the ballot of
the enſuing ſummer renewed our vigour and youth; and had the
militia ſubſiſted another year, we might have conteſted the prize
with the moſt perfect of our brethren.</p>
            <p>The loſs of ſo many buſy and idle hours was not compenſated by
any elegant pleaſure; and my temper was inſenſibly ſoured by the
ſociety of our ruſtic officers. In every ſtate there exiſts, however,
a balance of good and evil. The habits of a ſedentary life were
uſefully broken by the duties of an active profeſſion: in the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
exerciſe of the field I hunted with a battalion, inſtead of a pack;
and at that time I was ready, at any hour of the day or night, to
fly from quarters to London, from London to quarters, on the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0112200701:122"/>
ſlighteſt call of private or regimental buſineſs. But my principal
obligation to the militia, was the making me an Engliſhman, and a
ſoldier. After my foreign education, with my reſerved temper, I
ſhould long have continued a ſtranger in my native country, had I
not been ſhaken in this various ſcene of new faces and new friends:
had not experience forced me to feel the characters of our leading
men, the ſtate of parties, the forms of office, and the operation of
our civil and military ſyſtem. In this peaceful ſervice, I imbibed the
rudiments of the language, and ſcience of tactics, which opened a
new field of ſtudy and obſervation. I diligently read, and meditated,
the <hi>Memoires Militaires</hi> of Quintus Icilius, (Mr. Guichardt,) the
only writer who has united the merits of a profeſſor and a veteran.
The diſcipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a
clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of
the Hampſhire grenadiers (the reader may ſmile) has not been uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to the hiſtorian of the Roman empire.</p>
            <p>A youth of any ſpirit is fired even by the play of arms, and in
the firſt ſallies of my enthuſiaſm I had ſeriouſly attempted to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the regular profeſſion of a ſoldier. But this military fever
was cooled by the enjoyment of our mimic Bellona, who ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled
to my eyes her naked deformity. How often did I ſigh for my
proper ſtation in ſociety and letters. How often (a proud compariſon)
did I repeat the complaint of Cicero in the command of a provincial
army: <q>Clitellae bovi ſunt impoſitae. Eſt incredibile quam me
negotii taedeat. Non habet ſatis magnum campum ille tibi non
ignotus curſus animi; et induſtriae meae praeclara opera ceſſat.

potero; ſit modo annuum. Si prorogatur, actum eſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad Atticum, lib. v. 15.</note>
               </q>. From
a ſervice without danger I might indeed have retired without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
but as often as I hinted a wiſh of reſigning, my fetters
were rivetted by the friendly intreaties of the colonel, the parental
authority of the major, and my own regard for the honour and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0112200701:123"/>
welfare of the battalion. When I felt that my perſonal eſcape was
impracticable, I bowed my neck to the yoke: my ſervitude was
protracted far beyond the annual patience of Cicero; and it was not
till after the preliminaries of peace that I received my diſcharge, from
the act of government which diſembodied the militia<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>JOURNAL, January 11th, 1761.]—In theſe ſeven or eight months of a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeably active life, I have had no ſtudies to ſet down; indeed, I hardly took a book in my hand the whole time. The firſt two months at Blandford, I might have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but the novelty of the thing, of which for ſome time I was ſo fond as to think of going into the army, our field-days, our dinners abroad, and the drinking and late hours we got into, prevented any ſerious reflections. From the day we marched from Blandford I had hardly a moment I could call my own, almoſt continually in motion; if I was fixed for a day, it was in the guard-room, a barrack, or an inn. Our diſputes conſumed the little time I had left. Every letter, every memorial relative to them fell to my ſhare; and our evening conferences were uſed to hear all the morning hours ſtrike. At laſt I got to Dover, and Sir Thomas left us for two months. The charm was over, I was ſick of ſo hateful a ſervice; I was ſettled in a comparatively quiet ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Once more I began to taſte the pleaſure of thinking.</p>
                  <p>Recollecting ſome thoughts I had formerly had in relation to the ſyſtem of Paganiſm, which I intended to make uſe of in my Eſſay, I reſolved to read Tully de Naturâ Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and finiſhed it in about a month. I loſt ſome time before I could recover my habit of application.</p>
                  <p>Oct. 23d.]—Our firſt deſign was to march through Marlborough; but finding on inquiry that it was a bad road, and a great way about, we reſolved to puſh for the Devizes in one day, though nearly thirty miles. We accordingly arrived there about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>Nov. 2d.]—I have very little to ſay for this and the following month. Nothing could be more uniform than the life I led there. The little civility of the neighbouring gentlemen gave us no opportunity of dining out; the time of year did not tempt us to any excurſions round the country; and at firſt my indolence, and afterwards a violent cold, prevented my going over to Bath. I believe in the two months I never dined or lay from quarters. I can therefore only ſet down what I did in the literary way. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to recover my Greek, which I had ſomewhat neglected, I ſet myſelf to read Homer, and finiſhed the four firſt books of the Iliad, with Pope's tranſlation and notes; at the ſame time, to underſtand the geography of the Iliad, and particularly the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, I read the 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th books of Strabo, in Caſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon's Latin tranſlation: I likewiſe read Hume's Hiſtory of England to the Reign of Henry the Seventh, juſt publiſhed, <hi>ingenious but ſuperficial;</hi> and the <hi>Journals des Sçavans</hi> for Auguſt, September, and October 1761, with the <hi>Bibliotheque des Sciences,</hi> &amp;c. from July to October: Both theſe Journals ſpeak very handſomely of my book.</p>
                  <p>December 25th, 1761.]—When, upon finiſhing the year, I take a review of what I have done, I am not diſſatisfied with what I did in it, upon making proper allowances. On the one hand, I could begin nothing before the middle of January. The Deal duty loſt me part of February; although I was at home part of March, and all April, yet electioneering is no friend to the Muſes. May, indeed, though diſſipated by our ſea parties, was pretty quiet; but June was abſolutely loſt, upon the march, at Alton, and ſettling ourſelves in camp. The four ſucceeding months in camp allowed me little leiſure, and leſs quiet. November and December were indeed as much my own as any time can be whilſt I remain in the militia; but ſtill it is, at beſt, not a life for a man of letters. However, in this tumultuous year, (beſides ſmaller things which I have ſet down,) I read four books of Homer in Greek, ſix of Strabo in Latin, Cicero de Naturâ Deorum, and the great philoſophical and theological work of M. de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſobre: I wrote in the ſame time a long diſſertation on the ſucceſſion of Naples; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed, ſitted for the preſs, and augmented above a fourth, my Eſſai ſur l'Étude de la Litterature.</p>
                  <p>In the ſix weeks I paſſed at Beriton, as I never ſtirred from it, every day was like the former. I had neither viſits, hunting, or walking. My only reſources were my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my books, and family converſations.—But to me theſe were great reſources.</p>
                  <p>April 24th, 1762.]—I waited upon Colonel Harvey in the morning, to get him to apply for me to be brigade major to Lord Eſſingham, as a poſt I ſhould be very fond of, and for which I am not unfit. Harvey received me with great good-nature and candour, told me he was both willing and able to ſerve me; that indeed he had already applied to Lord Eſſingham for * * * * *, one of his own officers, and though there would be more than one brigade major, he did not think he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly recommend two; but that if I could get ſome other perſon to break the ice, he would ſecond it, and believed he ſhould ſucceed: ſhould that fail, as * * * * * was in bad circumſtances, he believed he could make a compromiſe with him (this was my deſire) to let me do the duty without pay. I went from him to the Mallets, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to get Sir Charles Howard to ſpeak to Lord Eſſingham.</p>
                  <p>Auguſt 22d.]—I went with Ballard to the French church, where I heard a moſt indifferent ſermon preached by M. * * * * * *. A very bad ſtyle, a worſe pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and action, and a very great vacuity of ideas, compoſed this excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Upon the whole, which is preferable, the philoſophic method of the Engliſh, or the rhetoric of the French preachers? The firſt (though leſs glorious) is certainly ſafer for the preacher. It is difficult for a man to make himſelf ridiculous, who propoſes only to deliver plain ſenſe on a ſubject he has thoroughly ſtudied. But the inſtant he diſcovers the leaſt pretenſions towards the ſublime, or the pathetic, there is no medium; we muſt either admire or laugh: and there are ſo many various talents requiſite to form the character of an orator, that it is more than probable we ſhall laugh. As to the advantage of the hearer, which ought to be the great conſideration, the dilemma is much greater. Excepting in ſome particular caſes, where we are blinded by popular prejudices, we are in general ſo well acquainted with our duty, that it is almoſt ſuperfluous to convince us of it. It is the heart, and not the head, that holds out; and it is certainly poſſible, by a moving eloquence, to rouſe the ſleeping ſentiments of that heart, and incite it to acts of virtue. Unluckily it is not ſo much acts, as habits of virtue, we ſhould have in view; and the preacher who is inculcating, with the eloquence of a Bourdaloue, the neceſſity of a virtuous life, will diſmiſs his aſſembly full of emotions, which a variety of other objects, the coldneſs of our northern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and no immediate opportunity of exerting their good reſolutions, will diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in a few moments.</p>
                  <p>Auguſt 24th.]—The ſame reaſon that carried ſo many people to the aſſembly to-night, was what kept me away; I mean the dancing.</p>
                  <p>28th.]—To-day Sir Thomas came to us to dinner. The Spa has done him a great deal of good, for he looks another man. Pleaſed to ſee him, we kept bumperizing till after roll-calling; Sir Thomas aſſuring us, every freſh bottle, how infinitely ſoberer he was grown.</p>
                  <p>29th.]—I felt the uſual conſequences of Sir Thomas's company, and loſt a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe I had loſt the day before. However, having finiſhed Voltaire, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Le Clerc (I mean for the amuſement of my leiſure hours); and laid aſide for ſome time his <hi>Bibliotheque Univerſelle,</hi> to look into the <hi>Bibliotheque Choiſie,</hi> which is by far the better work.</p>
                  <p>September 23d.]—Colonel Wilkes, of the Buckinghamſhire militia, dined with us, and renewed the acquaintance Sir Thomas and myſelf had begun with him at Reading. I ſcarcely ever met with a better companion; he has inexhauſtible ſpirits, infinite wit and humour, and a great deal of knowledge. He told us himſelf, that in this time of public diſſenſion he was reſolved to make his fortune. Upon this principle he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected himſelf cloſely with Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, commenced a public adverſary to Lord Bute, whom he abuſes weekly in the North Briton, and other political papers in which he is concerned. This proved a very debauched day: we drank a good deal both after dinner and ſupper; and when at laſt Wilkes had retired, Sir Thomas and ſome others (of whom I was not one) broke into his room, and made him drink a bottle of claret in bed.</p>
                  <p>October 5th.]—The review, which laſted about three hours, concluded, as uſual, with marching by Lord Eſſingham, by grand diviſions. Upon the whole, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the camp had done both the Wincheſter and the Goſport duties all the ſummer, they behaved very well, and made a ſine appearance. As they marched by, I had my uſual curioſity to count their files. The following is my field return: I think it a curioſity; I am ſure it is more exact than is commonly made to a reviewing general.</p>

                  <p>N. B. The Goſport detachment from the Lancaſhire conſiſted of two hundred and fifty men. The Buckinghamſhire took the Wincheſter duty that day.</p>
                  <p>So that this camp in England, ſuppoſed complete, with only one detachment, had under arms, on the day of the grand review, little more than half their eſtabliſhment. This amazing deficiency (though exemplified in every regiment I have ſeen) is an extraordinary military phoenomenon: what muſt it be upon foreign ſervice? I doubt whether a nominal army of an hundred thouſand men often brings fifty into the field.</p>
                  <p>Upon our return to Southampton in the evening, we found Sir Thomas Worſley.</p>
                  <p>October 21ſt.]—One of thoſe impulſes, which it is neither very eaſy nor very neceſſary to withſtand, drew me from Longinus to a very different ſubject, the Greek Calendar. Laſt night, when in bed, I was thinking of a diſſertation of M. de la Nauze upon the Roman calendar, which I read laſt year. This led me to conſider what was the Greek, and finding myſelf very ignorant of it, I determined to read a ſhort, but very excellent abſtract of Mr. Dodwell's book de Cyclis, by the famous Dr. Halley. It is only twenty-five pages; but as I meditated it thoroughly, and verified all the calculations, it was a very good morning's work.</p>
                  <p>October 28th.]—I looked over a new Greek Lexicon which I have juſt received from London. It is that of Robert Conſtantine, Lugdun. 1637. It is a very large volume in folio, in two parts, compriſing in the whole 1785 pages. After the great Theſaurus, this is eſteemed the beſt Greek Lexicon. It ſeems to be ſo. Of a variety of words for which I looked, I always found an exact definition; the various ſenſes well diſtinguiſhed, and properly ſupported, by the beſt authorities. However, I ſtill prefer the radical method of Scapula to this alphabetical one.</p>
                  <p>December 11th.]—I have already given an idea of the Goſport duty; I ſhall only add a trait which characterizes admirably our unthinking ſailors. At a time when they knew that they ſhould infallibly be diſcharged in a few weeks, numbers, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable wages due to them, were continually jumping over the walls, and riſquing the loſing of it for a few hours amuſement at Portſmouth.</p>
                  <p>17th.]—We found old Captain Meard at Alresford, with the ſecond diviſion of the fourteenth. He and all his officers ſupped with us, and made the evening rather a drunken one.</p>
                  <p>18th.]—About the ſame hour our two corps paraded to march off. They, an old corps of regulars, who had been two years quiet in Dover caſtle. We, part of a young body of militia, two-thirds of our men recruits, of four months ſtanding, two of which they had paſſed upon very diſagreeable duty. Every advantage was on their ſide, and yet our ſuperiority, both as to appearance and diſcipline, was ſo ſtriking, that the moſt prejudiced regular could not have heſitated a moment. At the end of the town our two companies ſeparated; my father's ſtruck off for Petersfield, whilſt I continued my rout to Alton; into which place I marched my company about noon; two years ſix months and fifteen days after my firſt leaving it. I gave the men ſome beer at roll-calling, which they received with great cheerfulneſs and decency. I dined and lay at Harriſon's, where I was received with that old-faſhioned breeding, which is at once ſo honourable and ſo troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>23d.]—Our two companies were diſembodied; mine at Alton, and my father's at Beriton. Smith marched them over from Petersfield: they fired three vollies, lodged the major's colours, delivered up their arms, received their money, partook of a dinner at the major's expence, and then ſeparated with great cheerfulneſs and regularity. Thus ended the militia; I may ſay ended, ſince our annual aſſemblies in May are ſo very precarious, and can be of ſo little uſe. However, our ſerjeants and drums are ſtill kept up, and quartered at the rendezvous of their company, and the adjutant remains at Southampton in full pay.</p>
                  <p>As this was an extraordinary ſcene of life, in which I was engaged above three years and a half from the date of my commiſſion, and above two years and a half from the time of our embodying, I cannot take my leave of it without ſome few reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. When I engaged in it, I was totally ignorant of its nature and conſequences. I offered, becauſe my father did, without ever imagining that we ſhould be called out, till it was too late to retreat with honour. Indeed, I believe it happens through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that our moſt important actions have been often determined by chance, caprice, or ſome very inadequate motive. After our embodying, many things contributed to make me ſupport it with great impatience. Our continual diſputes with the duke of Bolton; our unſettled way of life, which hardly allowed me books or leiſure for ſtudy; and more than all, the diſagreeable ſociety in which I was forced to live.</p>
                  <p>After mentioning my ſufferings, I muſt ſay ſomething of what I found agreeable. Now it is over, I can make the ſeparation much better than I could at the time. 1. The unſettled way of life itſelf had its advantages. The exerciſe and change of air and of objects amuſed me, at the ſame time that it fortified my health. 2. A new field of knowledge and amuſement opened itſelf to me; that of military affairs, which, both in my ſtudies and travels, will give me eyes for a new world of things, which before would have paſſed unheeded. Indeed, in that reſpect I can hardly help wiſhing our battalion had continued another year. We had got a fine ſet of new men, all our difficulties were over; we were perfectly well clothed and appointed; and, from the progreſs our recruits had already made, we could promiſe ourſelves that we ſhould be one of the beſt militia corps by next ſummer: a circumſtance that would have been the more agreeable to me, as I am now eſtabliſhed the real acting major of the battalion. But what I value moſt, is the knowledge it has given me of mankind in general, and of my own country in particular. The general ſyſtem of our government, the methods of our ſeveral offices, the departments and powers of their reſpective officers, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and municipal adminiſtration, the views of our ſeveral parties, the characters, connections, and influence of our principal people, have been impreſſed on my mind, not by vain theory, but by the indelible leſſons of action and experience. I have made a number of valuable acquaintance, and am myſelf much better known, than (with my reſerved character) I ſhould have been in ten years, paſſing regularly my ſummers at Beriton, and my winters in London. So that the ſum of all is, that I am glad the militia has been, and glad that it is no more.</p>

the pleaſures of reading and thinking; and the hungry appetite with
which I opened a volume of Tully's philoſophical works is ſtill
preſent to my memory. The laſt review of my Eſſay before its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,
had prompted me to inveſtigate the <hi>nature of the gods;</hi> my
inquiries led me to the Hiſtoire Critique du Manichèiſme of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſobre,

who diſcuſſes many deep queſtions of Pagan and Chriſtian
theology: and from this rich treaſury of facts and opinions, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
my own conſequences, beyond the holy circle of the author.
After this recovery I never relapſed into indolence; and my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
might prove, that in the life moſt averſe to ſtudy, ſome hours
may be ſtolen, ſome minutes may be ſnatched. Amidſt the tumult
of Wincheſter camp I ſometimes thought and read in my tent; in
the more ſettled quarters of the Devizes, Blandford, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,
I always ſecured a ſeparate lodging, and the neceſſary books;
and in the ſummer of 1762, while the new militia was raiſing, I
enjoyed at Beriton two or three months of literary repoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">JOURNAL, May 8th, 1762.]—This was my birth-day, on which I entered into the twenty-ſixth year of my age. This gave me occaſion to look a little into myſelf, and conſider impartially my good and bad qualities. It appeared to me, upon this inquiry, that my character was virtuous, incapable of a baſe action, and formed for generous ones; but that it was proud, violent, and diſagreeable in ſociety. Theſe qualities I muſt endeavour to cultivate, extirpate, or reſtrain, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tendency. Wit I have none. My imagination is rather ſtrong than pleaſing. My memory both capacious and retentive. The ſhining qualities of my underſtanding are extenſiveneſs and penetration; but I want both quickneſs and exactneſs. As to my ſituation in life, though I may ſometimes repine at it, it perhaps is the beſt adapted to my character. I can command all the conveniencies of life, and I can command too that independence, (that firſt earthly bleſſing,) which is hardly to be met with in a higher or lower fortune. When I talk of my ſituation, I muſt exclude that temporary one, of being in the militia. Though I go through it with ſpirit and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, it is both unfit for, and unworthy of me.</note>. In
forming a new plan of ſtudy, I heſitated between the mathematics
and the Greek language; both of which I had neglected ſince my
return from Lauſanne. I conſulted a learned and friendly mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician,
Mr. George Scott, a pupil of de Moivre; and his map
of a country which I have never explored, may perhaps be more

            <p>In the ſtudy of a poet who has ſince become the moſt intimate of
my friends, I ſucceſſively applied many paſſages and fragments of
Greek writers; and among theſe I ſhall notice a life of Homer, in
the Opuſcula Mythologica of Gale, ſeveral books of the geography
of Strabo, and the entire treatiſe of Longinus, which, from the title
and the ſtyle, is equally worthy of the epithet of <hi>ſublime.</hi> My
grammatical ſkill was improved, my vocabulary was enlarged; and
in the militia I acquired a juſt and indelible knowledge of the firſt of

eſſay, I renounced my firſt thought of the expedition of Charles
VIII. as too remote from us, and rather an introduction to great
events, than great and important in itſelf. I ſucceſſively choſe
and rejected the cruſade of Richard the Firſt, the barons' wars
againſt John and Henry the Third, the hiſtory of Edward the
Black Prince, the lives and compariſons of Henry V. and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
Titus, the life of Sir Philip Sidney, and that of the Marquis
of Montroſe. At length I have fixed on Sir Walter Raleigh for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0112200701:132"/>
my hero. His eventful ſtory is varied by the characters of the
ſoldier and ſailor, the courtier and hiſtorian; and it may afford
ſuch a fund of materials as I deſire, which have not yet been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
manufactured. At preſent I cannot attempt the execution
of this work. Free leiſure, and the opportunity of conſulting
many books, both printed and manuſcript, are as neceſſary as
they are impoſſible to be attained in my preſent way of life.
However, to acquire a general inſight into my ſubject and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources,
I read the life of Sir Walter Raleigh by Dr. Birch, his
copious article in the General Dictionary by the ſame hand, and
the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James the Firſt in Hume's
Hiſtory of England.</p>

Sir Walter Raleigh, and looked more cloſely into my materials.
I read the two volumes in quarto of the Bacon Papers, publiſhed
by Dr. Birch; the Fragmenta Regalia of Sir Robert Naunton,
Mallet's Life of Lord Bacon, and the political treatiſes of that
great man in the firſt volume of his works, with many of his

                        <p>I am afraid of being reduced to drop my hero; but my time
has not, however, been loſt in the reſearch of his ſtory, and of a
memorable aera of our Engliſh annals. The Life of Sir Walter
Raleigh, by Oldys, is a very poor performance; a ſervile pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric,
or flat apology, tediouſly minute, and compoſed in a dull
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0112200701:133"/>
and affected ſtyle. Yet the author was a man of diligence and
learning, who had read every thing relative to his ſubject, and
whoſe ample collections are arranged with perſpicuity and method.
Excepting ſome anecdotes lately revealed in the Sidney and Bacon
Papers, I know not what I ſhould be able to add. My ambition
(excluſive of the uncertain merit of ſtyle and ſentiment) muſt be
confined to the hope of giving a good abridgment of Oldys. I
I have even the diſappointment of finding ſome parts of this
copious work very dry and barren; and theſe parts are unluckily
ſome of the moſt characteriſtic: Raleigh's colony of Virginia, his
quarrels with Eſſex, the true ſecret of his conſpiracy, and, above
all, the detail of his private life, the moſt eſſential and important
to a biographer. My beſt reſource would be in the circumjacent
hiſtory of the times, and perhaps in ſome digreſſions artfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
like the fortunes of the Peripatetic philoſophy in the
portrait of Lord Bacon. But the reigns of Elizabeth and James
the Firſt are the periods of Engliſh hiſtory, which have been the
moſt variouſly illuſtrated: and what new lights could I reflect on
a ſubject, which has exerciſed the accurate induſtry of <hi>Birch,</hi> the
lively and curious acuteneſs of <hi>Walpole,</hi> the critical ſpirit of <hi>Hurd,</hi>
the vigorous ſenſe of <hi>Mallet</hi> and <hi>Robertſon,</hi> and the impartial
philoſophy of <hi>Hume?</hi> Could I even ſurmount theſe obſtacles,
I ſhould ſhrink with terror from the modern hiſtory of England,
where every character is a problem, and every reader a friend
or an enemy; where a writer is ſuppoſed to hoiſt a flag of party,
and is devoted to damnation by the adverſe faction. Such would
be <hi>my</hi> reception at home: and abroad, the hiſtorian of Raleigh
muſt encounter an indifference far more bitter than cenſure or
reproach. The events of his life are intereſting; but his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
is ambiguous, his actions are obſcure, his writings are
Engliſh, and his fame is confined to the narrow limits of our
language and our iſland. I muſt embrace a ſafer and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
theme.</p>

There is one which I ſhould prefer to all others, <hi>The Hiſtory
of the Liberty of the Swiſs,</hi> of that independence which a brave
people reſcued from the Houſe of Auſtria, defended againſt a
Dauphin of France, and finally ſealed with the blood of Charles
of Burgundy. From ſuch a theme, ſo full of public ſpirit, of
military glory, of examples of virtue, of leſſons of government,
the dulleſt ſtranger would catch fire: what might not <hi>I</hi> hope,
whoſe talents, whatſoever they may be, would be inflamed with
the zeal of patriotiſm. But the materials of this hiſtory are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible
to me, faſt locked in the obſcurity of an old barbarous
German dialect, of which I am totally ignorant, and which I
cannot reſolve to learn for this ſole and peculiar purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>I have another ſubject in view, which is the contraſt of the
former hiſtory: the one a poor, warlike, virtuous republic, which
emerges into glory and freedom; the other a commonwealth, ſoft,
opulent, and corrupt; which, by juſt degrees, is precipitated from
the abuſe to the loſs of her liberty: both leſſons are, perhaps,
equally inſtructive. This ſecond ſubject is, <hi>The Hiſtory of the
Republic of Florence, under the Houſe of Medicis:</hi> a period of one
hundred and fifty years, which riſes or deſcends from the dregs of
the Florentine democracy, to the title and dominion of Coſmo de
Medicis in the Grand Duchy of Tuſcany. I might deduce a
chain of revolutions not unworthy of the pen of Vertot; ſingular
men, and ſingular events; the Medicis four times expelled, and
as often recalled; and the Genius of Freedom reluctantly yielding
to the arms of Charles V. and the policy of Coſmo. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and fate of Savanerola, and the revival of arts and letters in
Italy, will be eſſentially connected with the elevation of the family
and the fall of the republic. The Medicis (ſtirps quaſi fataliter
nata ad inſtauranda vel fovenda ſtudia (Lipſius ad Germanos et
Gallos, Epiſt. viii.) were illuſtrated by the patronage of learning;
and enthuſiaſm was the moſt formidable weapon of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.

Twenty or thirty, perhaps, of the firſt men in the kingdom, in point of faſhion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſupping at little tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a coffee-room, upon a bit of cold meat, or a Sandwich, and drinking a glaſs of punch.

As I have ſince ſeen it acted, I ſhall defer my opinion of it till then; but I cannot help mentioning here the ſurpriſing verſatility of Mrs. Pritchard's talents, who rehearſed, almoſt at the ſame time, the part of a furious queen in the Green-room, and that of a coquette on the ſtage; and paſſed ſeveral times from one to the other with the utmoſt eaſe and happineſs.</p>

Books that I have read for themſelves, claſſic writers, or capital treatiſes upon any ſcience; ſuch books as ought to be peruſed with attention, and meditated with care. Of theſe I read <hi>the twenty laſt books of the Iliad twice, the three firſt books of the Odyſſey, the Life of Homer,</hi> and <hi>Longinus</hi>

Such as this year, <hi>Blackwall's Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer, Burke's Sublime and Beautiful, Hurd's Horace, Guichard's Memoires Militaires,</hi> a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of paſſages of the ancients occaſionally uſeful: large extracts from <hi>Mezeriac, Bayle,</hi> and <hi>Poter;</hi> and many memoirs and abſtracts from the <hi>Academy of Belles Lettres:</hi> among theſe I ſhall only mention here two long and curious ſuites of diſſertations—<hi>the one upon the Temple of Delphi, the Amphictyonic Council, and the Holy Wars, by M.

Books of amuſement and inſtruction, peruſed at my leiſure hours, without any reference to a regular plan of ſtudy. Of theſe, perhaps, I read too many, ſince I went through the Life of Eraſmus, by Le Clerc and Burigny, many extracts from <hi>Le Clerc's Bibliotheques, The Ciceronianus,</hi> and <hi>Colloquies of Eraſmus, Barclay's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genis, Teraſſon's Sethos, Voltaire's Siecle de Louis XIV.

The youthful habits of the language and manners of France had
left in my mind an ardent deſire of reviſiting the Continent on a
larger and more liberal plan. According to the law of cuſtom, and
perhaps of reaſon, foreign travel completes the education of an
Engliſh gentleman: my father had conſented to my wiſh, but I was
detained above four years by my raſh engagement in the militia. I
eagerly graſped the firſt moments of freedom: three or four weeks in
Hampſhire and London were employed in the preparations of my
journey, and the farewell viſits of friendſhip and civility: my laſt
act in town was to applaud Mallet's new tragedy of Elvira<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>JOURNAL, January 11th, 1763.]—I called upon Dr. Maty in the morning. He told me that the Duke de Nivernois deſired to be acquainted with me. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with that view that I had written to Maty from Beriton to preſent, in my name, a copy of my book to him. Thence I went to Becket, paid him his bill, (fifty-four pounds,) and gave him back his tranſlation. It muſt be printed, though very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.

I went to Covent Garden to ſee Woodward in Bobadil, and ſupped with the Mallets at George Scott's.</p>
                  <p>JOURNAL, Jan. 19th, 1763.]—I waited upon Lady Hervey and the Duke de Niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois, and received my credentials. Lady Hervey's are for M. le Comte de Caylus, and Madame Geoffrin. The Duke received me civilly, but (perhaps through Maty's fault) treated me more as a man of letters than as a man of faſhion. His letters are entirely in that ſtyle; for the Count de Caylus and M. M. de la Bleterie, de S<hi rend="sup">te</hi> Palaye, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peronier, du Clos, de Forcemagne, and d'Alembert. I then undreſſed for the play. My father and I went to the Roſe, in the paſſage of the play-houſe, where we found Mallet, with about thirty friends. We dined together, and went thence into the pit, where we took our places in a body, ready to ſilence all oppoſition. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we had no occaſion to exert ourſelves. Notwithſtanding the malice of party, Mallet's nation, connections, and, indeed, imprudence, we heard nothing but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. I think it was deſerved. The plan was borrowed from de la Motte, but the details and language have great merit. A ſine vein of dramatic poetry runs through the piece. The ſcenes between the father and ſon awaken almoſt every ſenſation of the human breaſt; and the counſel would have equally moved, but for the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience unavoidable upon all theatres, that of entruſting fine ſpeeches to indifferent actors. The perplexity of the cataſtrophe is much, and I believe juſtly, criticiſed. But another defect made a ſtronger impreſſion upon me. When a poet ventures upon the dreadful ſituation of a father who condemns his ſon to death, there is no medium, the father muſt either be a monſter or a hero. His obligations of juſtice, of the public good, muſt be as binding, as apparent, as perhaps thoſe of the firſt Brutus. The cruel neceſſity conſecrates his actions, and leaves no room for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The thought is ſhocking, if not carried into action. In the execution of Brutus's ſons I am ſenſible of that fatal neceſſity. Without ſuch an example, the unſettled liberty of Rome would have periſhed the inſtant after its birth. But Alonzo might have pardoned his ſon for a raſh attempt, the cauſe of which was a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and whoſe conſequences could never have diſturbed an eſtabliſhed government. He might have pardoned ſuch a crime in any other ſubject; and as the laws could exact only an equal rigour for a ſon, a vain appetite for glory, and a mad aſſectation of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, could alone have influenced him to exert an unequal and ſuperior ſeverity.</p>

ſcene which is always preſent is ſuppoſed to be within our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or at leaſt within our power. But in a foreign country, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
is our buſineſs and our pleaſure; and the traveller, conſcious
of his ignorance, and covetous of his time, is diligent in the ſearch
and the view of every object that can deſerve his attention. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
many hours of the morning to the circuit of Paris and the
neighbourhood, to the viſit of churches and palaces conſpicuous by
their architecture, to the royal manufactures, collections of books
and pictures, and all the various treaſures of art, of learning, and of
luxury. An Engliſhman may hear without reluctance, that in theſe
curious and coſtly articles Paris is ſuperior to London; ſince the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the French capital ariſes from the defects of its government
and religion. In the abſence of Louis XIV. and his ſucceſſors, the
Louvre has been left unfiniſhed: but the millions which have been
laviſhed on the ſands of Verſailles, and the moraſs of Marli, could
not be ſupplied by the legal allowance of a Britiſh king. The ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the French nobles is confined to their town reſidence; that
of the Engliſh is more uſefully diſtributed in their country feats;
and we ſhould be aſtoniſhed at our own riches, if the labours of
architecture, the ſpoils of Italy and Greece, which are now ſcattered
from Inverary to Wilton, were accumulated in a few ſtreets between
Marybone and Weſtminſter. All ſuperfluous ornament is rejected
by the cold frugality of the proteſtants; but the catholic ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is always the enemy of reaſon, is often the parent of
the arts. The wealthy communities of prieſts and monks expend
their revenues in ſtately edifices; and the pariſh church of St. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,
one of the nobleſt ſtructures in Paris, was built and adorned
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0112200701:139"/>
by the private induſtry of a late curé. In this outſet, and ſtill more
in the ſequel of my tour, my eye was amuſed; but the pleaſing
viſion cannot be fixed by the pen; the particular images are darkly
ſeen through the medium of five-and-twenty years, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of my life muſt not degenerate into a book of travels<note n="*" place="bottom">JOURNAL, 21 Fevrier 1763.]—Aujourdhui j'ai commencé ma tournée, pour voir les endroits dignes d'attention dans la ville. D'Augny m'a accompagné. Nous ſommes allés d'abord à la bibliotheque de l'Abbayé de St. Germain des Prez, où tout le monde étoit occupé à l'arrangement d'un cabinet de curioſités, et à l'hòpital des in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valides, où le dòme étoit fermé à cauſe des reparations qu'on y faiſoit. Il faut donc differer la viſite et la deſcription de ces deux endroits. De là nous ſommes allés voir l'école militaire. Comme ce bâtiment s'éleve à coté des Invalides, bien des gens y verroient un moyen aſſez facile d'apprecier les ames differentes de leurs fondateurs. Dans l'un tout eſt grand et faſtueux, dans l'autre tout eſt petit et meſquin. De petits corps de logis blancs et aſſez propres, qui, au lieu de 500 gentilſhommes, dont on a parlé, en con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiennent 258, compoſent tout l'etabliſſement; car le manége et les ecuries ne ſont rien. Il eſt vrai qu'on dit que ces batimens ne ſont qu'un échaffaudage, qu'on doit ôter, pour élever le véritable ouvrage ſur ces débris. Il faut bien en effet qu'on n'ait pas bâti pour l'éternité, puiſque dans vingt ans la plûpart des poutres ſe font pourries. Nous jettâmes enſuite un coup d'oeil ſur l'égliſe de St. Sulpice, dont la façade (le prétexte et le fruit de tant de lotteries) n'eſt point encore achevée.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the principal end of my journey was to enjoy the ſociety
of a poliſhed and amiable people, in whoſe favour I was ſtrongly
prejudiced, and to converſe with ſome authors, whoſe converſation,
as I fondly imagined, muſt be far more pleaſing and inſtructive than
their writings. The moment was happily choſen. At the cloſe of
a ſucceſsful war the Britiſh name was reſpected on the continent.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Our opinions, our faſhions, even our games, were adopted in
France, a ray of national glory illuminated each individual, and
every Engliſhman was ſuppoſed to be born a patriot and a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
For myſelf, I carried a perſonal recommendation; my name and
my Eſſay were already known; the compliment of having written in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0112200701:140"/>
the French language entitled me to ſome returns of civility and
gratitude. I was conſidered as a man of letters, who wrote
for amuſement. Before my departure I had obtained from the
Duke de Nivernois, Lady Hervey, the Mallets, Mr. Walpole, &amp;c.
many letters of recommendation to their private or literary friends.
Of theſe epiſtles the reception and ſucceſs were determined by
the character and ſituation of the perſons by whom and to whom
they were addreſſed: the ſeed was ſometimes caſt on a barren
rock, and it ſometimes multiplied an hundred fold in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of new ſhoots, ſpreading branches, and exquiſite fruit.
But upon the whole, I had reaſon to praiſe the national urbanity,
which from the court has diffuſed its gentle influence to the ſhop,
the cottage, and the ſchools. Of the men of genius of the age,
Monteſquieu and Fontenelle were no more; Voltaire reſided on his
own eſtate near Geneva; Rouſſeau in the preceding year had been
driven from his hermitage of Montmorency; and I bluſh at my
having neglected to ſeek, in this journey, the acquaintance of Buffon.
Among the men of letters whom I ſaw, D'Alembert and Diderot
held the foremoſt rank in merit, or at leaſt in fame. I ſhall content
myſelf with enumerating the well-known names of the Count de
Caylus, of the Abbé de la Bleterie, Barthelemy, Reynal, Arnaud,
of Meſſieurs de la Condamine, du Clos, de S<hi rend="sup">te</hi> Palaye, de Bougainville,
Caperonnier, de Guignes, Suard, &amp;c. without attempting to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the ſhades of their characters, or the degrees of our connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Alone, in a morning viſit, I commonly found the artiſts and
authors of Paris leſs vain, and more reaſonable, than in the circles
of their equals, with whom they mingle in the houſes of the rich.
Four days in a week I had a place, without invitation, at the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable
tables of Meſdames Geoffrin and du Bocage, of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Helvetius, and of the Baron d'Olbach. In theſe ſympoſia

Heureux effet de ce caractere leger et aimable du François, qui a établi dans Paris une douceur et une liberté dans la ſociété, inconnues à l'antiquité, et encore ignorées des autres nations. A Londres il faut faire ſon chemin dans les maiſons que ne s'ouvrent qu'avec peine. Là on croit vous faire plaiſir en vous rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Ici on croit s'en faire à ſoi-meme.

            <p>The ſociety of Madame du Bocage was more ſoft and moderate
than that of her rivals, and the evening converſations of M. de
Foncemagne were ſupported by the good ſenſe and learning of the
principal members of the Academy of Inſcriptions. The opera and
the Italians I occaſionally viſited; but the French theatre, both in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0112200701:142"/>
tragedy and comedy, was my daily and favourite amuſement. Two
famous actreſſes then divided the public applauſe. For my own
part, I preferred the conſummate art of the Clairon, to the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
ſallies of the Dumeſnil, which were extolled by her admirers,
as the genuine voice of nature and paſſion. Fourteen weeks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
ſtole away; but had I been rich and independent, I ſhould
have prolonged, and perhaps have fixed, my reſidence at Paris.</p>
            <p>Between the expenſive ſtyle of Paris and of Italy it was prudent
to interpoſe ſome months of tranquil ſimplicity; and at the thoughts
of Lauſanne I again lived in the pleaſures and ſtudies of my early
youth. Shaping my courſe through Dijon and Beſançon, in the
laſt of which places I was kindly entertained by my couſin Acton, I
arrived in the month of May 1763 on the banks of the Leman
Lake. It had been my intention to paſs the Alps in the autumn,
but ſuch are the ſimple attractions of the place, that the year had
almoſt expired before my departure from Lauſanne in the enſuing
ſpring. An abſence of five years had not made much alteration in
manners, or even in perſons. My old friends, of both ſexes, hailed
my voluntary return; the moſt genuine proof of my attachment.
They had been flattered by the preſent of my book, the produce of
their ſoil; and the good Pavilliard ſhed tears of joy as he embraced
a pupil, whoſe literary merit he might fairly impute to his own
labours. To my old liſt I added ſome new acquaintance, and among
the ſtrangers I ſhall diſtinguiſh Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg, the
brother of the reigning Duke, at whoſe country-houſe, near Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne,
I frequently dined: a wandering meteor, and at length a
falling ſtar, his light and ambitious ſpirit had ſucceſſively dropped
from the firmament of Pruſſia, of France, and of Auſtria; and his
faults, which he ſtiled his misfortunes, had driven him into philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic
exile in the Pais de Vaud. He could now moralize on the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the world, the equality of mankind, and the happineſs of
a private ſtation. His addreſs was affable and polite, and as he had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0112200701:143"/>
ſhone in courts and armies, his memory could ſupply, and his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
could adorn, a copious fund of intereſting anecdotes. His
firſt enthuſiaſm was that of charity and agriculture; but the ſage
gradually lapſed in the ſaint, and Prince Lewis of Wirtemberg is
now buried in a hermitage near Mayence, in the laſt ſtage of myſtic
devotion. By ſome eccleſiaſtical quarrel, Voltaire had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to withdraw himſelf from Lauſanne, and retire to his caſtle
at Ferney, where I again viſited the poet and the actor, without
ſeeking his more intimate acquaintance, to which I might now have
pleaded a better title. But the theatre which he had founded, the
actors whom he had formed, ſurvived the loſs of their maſter; and
recent from Paris, I attended with pleaſure at the repreſentation of
ſeveral tragedies and comedies. I ſhall not deſcend to ſpecify par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
names and characters; but I cannot forget a private inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which will diſplay the innocent freedom of Swiſs manners.
My favourite ſociety had aſſumed, from the age of its members, the
proud denomination of the ſpring (<hi>la ſociété du printems</hi>). It
conſiſted of fifteen or twenty young unmarried ladies, of genteel,
though not of the very firſt families; the eldeſt perhaps about
twenty, all agreeable, ſeveral handſome, and two or three of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
beauty. At each other's houſes they aſſembled almoſt every day,
without the controul, or even the preſence, of a mother or an aunt;
they were truſted to their own prudence, among a crowd of young
men of every nation in Europe. They laughed, they ſung, they
danced, they played at cards, they acted comedies; but in the midſt
of this careleſs gaiety, they reſpected themſelves, and were reſpected
by the men; the inviſible line between liberty and licentiouſneſs was
never trangreſſed by a geſture, a word, or a look, and their virgin
chaſtity was never ſullied by the breath of ſcandal or ſuſpicion. A
ſingular inſtitution, expreſſive of the innocent ſimplicity of Swiſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
After having taſted the luxury of England and Paris, I could not
have returned with ſatisfaction to the coarſe and homely table of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0112200701:144"/>
Pavilliard; nor was her huſband offended that I now entered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as a <hi>penſionaire,</hi> or boarder, in the elegant houſe of Mr. De Meſery,
which may be entitled to a ſhort remembrance, as it has ſtood above
twenty years, perhaps, without a parallel in Europe. The houſe in
which we lodged was ſpacious and convenient, in the beſt ſtreet, and
commanding, from behind, a noble proſpect over the country and the
Lake. Our table was ſerved with neatneſs and plenty; the boarders
were ſelect; we had the liberty of inviting any gueſts at a ſtated
price; and in the ſummer the ſcene was occaſionally transferred to
a pleaſant villa, about a league from Lauſanne. The characters of
Maſter and Miſtreſs were happily ſuited to each other, and to their
ſituation. At the age of ſeventy-five, Madame de Meſery, who
has ſurvived her huſband, is ſtill a graceful, I had almoſt ſaid a
handſome woman. She was alike qualified to preſide in her kitchen
and her drawing-room; and ſuch was the equal propriety of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
that of two or three hundred foreigners, none ever failed in
reſpect, none could complain of her neglect, and none could ever
boaſt of her favour. Meſery himſelf, of the noble family of De
Crouſaz, was a man of the world, a jovial companion, whoſe eaſy
manners and natural fallies maintained the cheerfulneſs of his houſe.
His wit could laugh at his own ignorance: he diſguiſed, by an air
of profuſion, a ſtrict attention to his intereſt; and in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
he appeared like a nobleman who ſpent his fortune and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his friends. In this agreeable ſociety I reſided nearly eleven
months (May 1763—April 1764); and in this ſecond viſit to Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne,
among a crowd of my Engliſh companions, I knew and
eſteemed Mr. Holroyd (now Lord Sheffield); and our mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
was renewed and fortified in the ſubſequent ſtages of our
Italian journey. Our lives are in the power of chance, and a ſlight
variation on either ſide, in time or place, might have deprived me
of a friend, whoſe activity in the ardour of youth was always

Voyons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment j'ai employé cette portion de mon exiſtence qui s'eſt écoulée et qui ne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viendra plus. Le mois de Janvier s'eſt paſſé dans le ſein de ma famille à qui il falloit ſacrifier tous mes momens, parcequ'ils étoient les derniers dans les ſoins d'un départ et dans l'embarras d'un voyage. Dans ce voyage cependant je trouvai moyen de lire les lettres de <hi>Buſbequius,</hi> Miniſtre Imperial à la Porte. Elles ſont auſſi inté<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſantes qu'inſtructives. Je reſtai à Paris depuis le 28 JANVIER juſqu'au 9 MAI. Pendant tout ce tems je n'étudiai point. Les amuſements m'occupoient beaucoup, et l'habitude de la diſſipation, qu'on prend ſi facilement dans les grandes villes, ne me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettoient pas de mettre à proſit le tems qui me demeuroit. A la verité, ſi j'ai peu feuilleté les livres, l'obſervation de tous les objets curieux qui ſe preſentent dans une grande capitale, et la converſation avec les plus grands hommes du ſiécle, m'ont inſtruit de beaucoup de choſes que je n'aurois point trouvé dans les livres. Les ſept ou huit derniers mois de cette année ont été plus tranquilles. Dès que je me ſuis vu etabli à Lauſanne, j'ai entrepris une étude ſuivie ſur la géographie ancienne de l'Italie. Mon ardeur s'eſt très bien foutenue pendant ſix ſemaines juſqu'à la fin du mois de Juin. Ce fut alors qu'un voyage de Geneve interrompit un peu mon aſſiduité, que le ſejour de Meſery m'oſſrit mille diſtractions, et que la ſociété de Sauſſure acheva de me faire perdre mon tems. Je repris mon travail avec ce Journal au milieu <hi>d'Aout,</hi> et depuis ce tems, juſqu'au commencement de <hi>Novembre,</hi> j'ai mis a profit tous mes inſtans; j'avoue que pendant les deux derniers mois mon ardeur s'eſt un peu rallantie. I<hi rend="sup">reme•t</hi>, Dans cette étude ſuivie j'ai lu: 1. Près de deux livres de la géographie de <hi>Strabon</hi> ſur l'Italie deux fois. 2. Une partie du deuxiéme livre de l'hiſtoire naturelle de <hi>Pline.</hi> 3. Le quatriéme chapitre du deuxiéme livre de <hi>Pomponius Mela.</hi> 4. Les Itineraires d'Antonin, et de Jeruſalem pour ce qui regarde l'Italie. Je les ai lus avec les Commentaires de Weſſeling, &amp;c. J'en ai tiré des tables de toutes les grandes routes de l'Italie, reduiſant partout les milles Romains, en milles Anglois, et en lieues de France, ſelon les calculs de M. d'Anville. 5. L'Hiſtoire des Grands Chemins de l'Empire Romain, par M. Bergier, deux volumes in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 5. Quelques Extraits choiſis de Ciceron, Tite Live, Velleius Paterculus, Tacite, et les deux Plines. La <hi>Roma Vetus</hi> de Nardini et plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs autres opuſcules ſur le même ſujet qui compoſent preſque tout le quatriéme tome du Treſor des Antiquités Romaines de Graevius. 7.

Le Traité ſur les Meſures Itineraires par M. d'Anville, et quelques Memoires de l'Academie des Belles Lettres. II<hi rend="sup">ment</hi>, On me fit attendre Nardini de la Bibliotheque de Geneve. Je voulus remplir ce moment de vuide par la lecture de <hi>Juvenal,</hi> poëte qui je ne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſois encore que de réputation. Je le lu deux fois avec plaiſir et avec ſoin.

Auſſi ſans compter un grand nombre d'obſervations détachées, il s'y trouve des diſſertations ſavantes et raiſonées. Celle du paſſage d'Annibal contient dix pages, et celle ſur le guerre ſociale en a douze. Mais ces morceaux ſont trop etendus, et le journal même a beſoin d'une reforme qui lui retranche quantité de pieces qui ſont aſſez étrangeres à ſon veritable plan.

Je conſerverai cependant fa liaiſon avec le journal par des renvois conſtans qui marqueront le numero de chaque piece avec le tems et l'occaſion de ſa compoſition.

                  <p>6 Avril 1764.]—J'ai été eveillé par Pavilliard et H * * * * pour arrêter une facheuſe affaire qui s'etoit paſſée au bal après notre départ. G * * * * qui faiſoit ſa cour a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle * * * * * * depuis long tems, voyoit avec peine que * * * * * * (* * * * * *) menacoit de le ſupplanter. Il ne répondoit jamais aux politeſſes de ſon rival, que par des bruſqueries; et a la ſin a l'occaſion de la main de Mademoiſelle * * * * * * il s'emporta contre lui le plus mal à propos du monde, et le traita devant tout le monde <hi>d'imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> &amp;c. J'ai appris de Pavilliard que * * * * * * lui avoit envoyé un cartel, et que la reponſe de G * * * * ne l'ayant point contenté ils devoient ſe rencontrer à cinq heures du ſoir. Au déſeſpoir de voir mon ami engagé dans une affaire qui ne pouvoit que lui faire du tort, j'ai couru chez M. de Crouſaz où demeuroit * * * * * *. J'ai bientot vu qu'il ne lui falloit qu'une explication aſſez légere, jointe a quelque apologie de la part de G * * * * pour le déſarmer, et je ſuis retourné chez lui avec H * * * * pour l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gager a la donner. Nous lui avons fait comprendre que l'aveu d'une veritable tort ne bleſſoit jamais l'honneur, et que ſon inſulte envers les dames auſſi bien qu'envers * * * * * étoit ſans excuſe. Je lui ai dicté un billet convenable, mais ſans la moindre baſſeſſe, que j'ai porté au Hollandois. Il a rendu les armes ſur le champ, lui a fait la réponſe la plus polie, et m'a remercié mille fois du rôle que j'avois fait. En vérité cet homme n'eſt pas diſſicile. Après diner j'ai vu nos dames à qui j'ai porté une lettre d'excuſes. La mere n'en veut plus a G * * * *, mais Mademoifelle * * * * * * eſt deſolée du tort que certe affaire peut lui faire dans le monde. Cette négociation m'a pris le jour entier; mais peut on mieux employer un jour qu'à ſauver la vie, peutêtre a deux perſonnes, et a conſerver la réputation d'un ami? Au reſte j'ai vu au fond plus d'un caractére. G * * * * * eſt brave, vrai, et ſensé, mais d'une impétuoſité qui n'eſt que plus dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereuſe pour être ſupprimée a l'ordinaire. C * * * * * eſt d'une étourderie d'enfant. De S * * * * d'une indifference qui vient bien plus d'un défaut de ſenſibilité, que d'un excès de raiſon. J'ai conçu une véritable amitié pour H * * * *.

If my ſtudies at Paris had been conſined to the ſtudy of the world,
three or four months would not have been unprofitably ſpent. My
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0112200701:147"/>
viſits, however ſuperficial, to the Academy of Medals and the public
libraries, opened a new field of inquiry; and the view of ſo many
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0112200701:148"/>
manuſcripts of different ages and characters induced me to conſult the
two great Benedictine works, the <hi>Diplomatica</hi> of Mabillon, and the
<hi>Palaeographia</hi> of Montfaucon. I'ſtudied the theory without attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the practice of the art: nor ſhould I complain of the intricacy of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0112200701:149"/>
Greek abbreviations and Gothic alphabets, ſince every day, in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
language, I am at a loſs to decypher the hieroglyphics of a
female note. In a tranquil ſcene, which revived the memory of my
firſt ſtudies, idleneſs would have been leſs pardonable: the public
libraries of Lauſanne and Geneva liberally ſupplied me with books;
and if many hours were loſt in diſſipation, many more were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in literary labour. In the country, Horace and Virgil, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal
and Ovid, were my aſſiduous companions: but, in town, I
formed and executed a plan of ſtudy for the uſe of my Tranſalpine
expedition: the topography of old Rome, the ancient geography of
Italy, and the ſcience of medals. 1. I diligently read, almoſt always
with my pen in my hand, the elaborate treatiſes of Nardini, Donatus,
&amp;c. which fill the fourth volume of the Roman Antiquities of
Graevius. 2. I next undertook and finiſhed the <hi>Italia Antiqua</hi> of
Cluverius, a learned native of Pruſſia, who had meaſured, on foot,
every ſpot, and has compiled and digeſted every paſſage of the
ancient writers. Theſe paſſages in Greek or Latin authors I peruſed
in the text of Cluverius, in two folio volumes: but I ſeparately read
the deſcriptions of Italy by Strabo, Pliny, and Pomponius Mela, the
Catalogues of the Epic poets, the Itineraries of Weſſeling's Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,
and the coaſting Voyage of Rutilius Numatianus; and I ſtudied
two kindred ſubjects in the Meſures Itineraires of d'Anville, and the
copious work of Bergier, <hi>Hiſtoire des grands Chemins de l'Empire
Romain.</hi> From theſe materials I formed a table of roads and diſtances
reduced to our Engliſh meaſure; filled a folio common-place book
with my collections and remarks on the geography of Italy; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferted
in my journal many long and learned notes on the inſulae and
populouſneſs of Rome, the ſocial war, the paſſage of the Alps by
Hannibal, &amp;c. 3. After glancing my eye over Addiſon's agreeable
dialogues, I more ſeriouſly read the great work of Ezechiel Spanheim
<hi>de Praeſtantiâ et Uſù Numiſmatum,</hi> and applied with him the medals
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0112200701:150"/>
of the kings and emperors, the families and colonies, to the illuſtration
of ancient hiſtory. And thus was I armed for my Italian journey<note n="*" place="bottom">

Après diner nous nous ſommes échappés pour faire quelques viſites aux * * *, aux * * *, et aux * * *. Je pars avec quelques regrets: cependant un peu de vin, et une gayeté dont je ne pouvois rendre raiſon, m'ont rendu d'une étourderie ſans pareille, vis-a-vis de ces petites. Je leur ai dit cent folies, et nous nous ſommes embraſſés en riant. Meſery nous a donné un très beau ſouper avec une partie de la compagnie du matin, augmentée de Bourgeois et de Pavilliard.

                  <p>Je quitte Lauſanne avec moins de regret que la première fois. Je n'y laiſſe plus que des connoiſſances. C'etoit la maitreſſe et l'ami dont je pleurois la perte. D'ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieurs je voyois Lauſanne avec les yeux encore novices d'un jeune homme, qui lui devoit la partie raiſonable de fon exiſtence, et qui jugeoit fans objets de compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſon. Aujourdhui j'y vois une ville mal batie, au milieu d'un pays delicieux, qui jouit de la paix et du repos, et qui les prend pour la liberté. Un peuple nombreux et bien élevé, qui aime la ſociété, qui y eſt propre, et qui admet avec plaiſir les étrangers dans ſes cotteries, qui ſeroient bien plus agréables, ſi la converſation n'avoit pas cédé la place au jeu. Les ſemmes ſont jolies, et malgré leur grande liberté, elles ſont très ſages. Tout au plus peuvent elles être un peu complaiſantes, dans l'idée honnête, mais incertaine, de rendre un étranger dans leurs ſilets. L'affectation eſt le péché originel des Lauſannois. Affectation de depenſe, affectation de nobleſſe, affectation d'eſprit: les deux premiéres ſont fort repandues, pendant que la troiſiéme eſt fort rare. Comme ce vice ſe choque a tout inſtant avec celui des autres, Lauſanne ſe trouve partagée dans un grand nombre d'etats, dont les principes et le langage varient a l'infini, et qui n'ont de commun que leur mepris reciproque les uns pour les autres. Leur gout pour la depenſe s'accorde mal avec celui de la nobleſſe. Ils périroient plutot que de renoncer a leurs grandeurs, ou d'embraſſer la ſeule profeſſion qui puiſſe les y ſoutenir. La maiſon de M. De Meſery eſt charmante: le caractére franc et genereux du Mari, les agrémens de la femme, une ſituation délicieuſe, une chere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente, la compagnie de ſes compatriotes, et une liberté parfaite, font aimer ce ſéjour a tout Anglois.

            <p>I ſhall advance with rapid brevity in the narrative of this tour, in
which ſomewhat more than a year (April 1764—May 1765) was
agreeably employed. Content with tracing my line of march, and
ſlightly touching on my perſonal feelings, I ſhall wave the minute
inveſtigation of the ſcenes which have been viewed by thouſands,
and deſcribed by hundreds, of our modern travellers. ROME is the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0112200701:151"/>
great object of our pilgrimage: and 1ſt, the journey; 2d, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and 3d, the return; will form the moſt proper and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
diviſion. 1. I climbed Mount Cenis, and deſcended into the
plain of Piedmont, not on the back of an elephant, but on a light
oſier ſeat, in the hands of the dextrous and intrepid chairmen of the
Alps. The architecture and government of Turin preſented the
ſame aſpect of tame and tireſome uniformity: but the court was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
with decent and ſplendid oeconomy; and I was introduced
to his Sardinian majeſty<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Letter, No. XII.</note> Charles Emanuel, who, after the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Frederic, held the ſecond rank (proximus longo tamen inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallo)
among the kings of Europe. The ſize and populouſneſs of
Milan could not ſurpriſe an inhabitant of London: but the fancy is
amuſed by a viſit to the Boromean Iſlands, an enchanted palace, a
work of the fairies in the midſt of a lake encompaſſed with moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and far removed from the haunts of men. I was leſs amuſed
by the marble palaces of Genoa, than by the recent memorials of her
deliverance (in December 1746) from the Auſtrian tyranny; and I
took a military ſurvey of every ſcene of action within the incloſure
of her double walls. My ſteps were detained at Parma and Modena,
by the precious relics of the Farneſe and Eſte collections: but, alas!
the far greater part had been already tranſported, by inheritance or
purchaſe, to Naples and Dreſden. By the road of Bologna and the
Apennine I at laſt reached Florence, where I repoſed from June to
September, during the heat of the ſummer months. In the Gallery,
and eſpecially in the Tribune, I firſt acknowledged, at the feet of
the Venus of Medicis, that the chiſſel may diſpute the pre-eminence
with the pencil, a truth in the fine arts which cannot on this ſide of
the Alps be felt or underſtood. At home I had taken ſome leſſons
of Italian: on the ſpot I read, with a learned native, the claſſics of
the Tuſcan idiom: but the ſhortneſs of my time, and the uſe of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0112200701:152"/>
French language, prevented my acquiring any facility of ſpeaking;
and I was a ſilent ſpectator in the converſations of our envoy, Sir
Horace Mann, whoſe moſt ſerious buſineſs was that of entertaining
the Engliſh at his hoſpitable table<note n="*" place="bottom">JOURNAL, Florence, Aout 9<hi rend="sup">me</hi>, 1764.]—Cocchi à diné avec nous. Nous avons beaucoup cauſé, mais je ne lui trouve pas le genie qu'on lui attribue, c'eſt peutêtre, parceque les notres ne ſont pas analogues. J'entrevois de l'extravagance dans ſes idées, de l'affectation dans ſes maniéres. Il ſe plaint à tout moment de ſa pauvreté. Il connoit peu la veritable dignité d'un homme de lettres. S'il a beaucoup de ſcience, elle eſt bornée à la phyſique. Il m'a demandé ſi Lord Spenſer ne pouvoit pas faire des éveques, et m'a fait un conte de Lord Lyttelton (dont il ne peut ſouffrir le fils) ou il étoit queſtion des Parlemens de Campagne.</note>. After leaving Florence, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the ſolitude of Piſa with the induſtry of Lucca and Leghorn,
and continued my journey through Sienna to Rome, where I arrived
in the beginning of October. 2. My temper is not very ſuſceptible
of enthuſiaſm; and the enthuſiaſm which I do not feel, I have ever
ſcorned to affect. But, at the diſtance of twenty-five years, I can
neither forget nor expreſs the ſtrong emotions which agitated my
mind as I firſt approached and entered the <hi>eternal city.</hi> After a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
night, I trod, with a lofty ſtep, the ruins of the Forum; each
memorable ſpot where Romulus <hi>ſtood,</hi> or Tully ſpoke, or Caeſar fell,
was at once preſent to my eye; and ſeveral days of intoxication
were loſt or enjoyed before I could deſcend to a cool and minute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation.
My guide was Mr. Byers, a Scotch antiquary of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and taſte; but, in the daily labour of eighteen weeks, the
powers of attention were ſometimes fatigued, till I was myſelf qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
in a laſt review, to ſelect and ſtudy the capital works of
ancient and modern art. Six weeks were borrowed for my tour of
Naples, the moſt populous of cities, relative to its ſize, whoſe luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
inhabitants ſeem to dwell on the conſines of paradiſe and hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
I was preſented to the boy-king by our new envoy, Sir William
Hamilton; who, wiſely diverting his correſpondence from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State to the Royal Society and Britiſh Muſeum, has eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0112200701:153"/>
a country of ſuch ineſtimable value to the naturaliſt and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarian.
On my return, I fondly embraced, for the laſt time, the
miracles of Rome; but I departed without kiſſing the feet of Rezzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico
(Clement XIII.), who neither poſſeſſed the wit of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
Lambertini, nor the virtues of his ſucceſſor Ganganelli. 3. In
my pilgrimage from Rome to Loretto I again croſſed the Apennine;
from the coaſt of the Adriatic I traverſed a fruitful and populous
country, which could alone diſprove the paradox of Monteſquieu,
that modern Italy is a deſert. Without adopting the excluſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the natives, I ſincerely admire the paintings of the Bologna
ſchool. I haſtened to eſcape from the ſad ſolitude of Ferrara, which
in the age of Caeſar was ſtill more deſolate. The ſpectacle of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice
afforded ſome hours of aſtoniſhment; the univerſity of Padua
is a dying taper: but Verona ſtill boaſts her amphitheatre, and his
native Vicenza is adorned by the claſſic architecture of Palladio:
the road of Lombardy and Piedmont (did Monteſquieu find them
without inhabitants?) led me back to Milan, Turin, and the paſſage
of Mount Cenis, where I again croſſed the Alps in my way to
Lyons.</p>
            <p>The uſe of foreign travel has been often debated as a general
queſtion; but the concluſion muſt be finally applied to the character
and circumſtances of each individual. With the education of boys,
<hi>where</hi> or <hi>how</hi> they may paſs over ſome juvenile years with the leaſt
miſchief to themſelves or others, I have no concern. But after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the previous and indiſpenſable requiſites of age, judgment, a
competent knowledge of men and books, and a freedom from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
prejudices, I will briefly deſcribe the qualifications which I
deem moſt eſſential to a traveller. He ſhould be endowed with
an active, indefatigable vigour of mind and body, which can ſeize
every mode of conveyance, and ſupport, with a careleſs ſmile, every
hardſhip of the road, the weather, or the inn. The benefits of foreign
travel will correſpond with the degrees of theſe qualifications; but,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0112200701:154"/>
in this ſketch, thoſe to whom I am known will not accuſe me of
framing my own panegyric. It was at Rome, on the 15th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1764, as I ſat muſing amidſt the ruins of the Capitol, while the
bare-footed fryars were ſinging veſpers in the Temple of Jupiter<note n="*" place="bottom">Now the church of the Zoccolants, or Franciſcan Friars.</note>,
that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city firſt ſtarted to
my mind. But my original plan was circumſcribed to the decay of
the city rather than of the empire: and, though my reading and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
began to point towards that object, ſome years elapſed, and
ſeveral avocations intervened, before I was ſeriouſly engaged in the
execution of that laborious work.</p>
            <p>I had not totally renounced the ſouthern provinces of France, but
the letters which I found at Lyons were expreſſive of ſome impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
Rome and Italy had ſatiared my curious appetite, and I was
now ready to return to the peaceful retreat of my family and books.
After a happy fortnight I reluctantly left Paris, embarked at Calais,
again landed at Dover, after an interval of two years and five months,
and haſtily drove through the ſummer duſt and ſolitude of London.
On the 25th of June 1765 I arrived at my father's houſe: and the
five years and a half between my travels and my father's death (1770)
are the portion of my life which I paſſed with the leaſt enjoyment,
and which I remember with the leaſt ſatisfaction. Every ſpring I
attended the monthly meeting and exerciſe of the militia at South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton;
and by the reſignation of my father, and the death of Sir
Thomas Worſley, I was ſucceſſively promoted to the rank of major
and lieutenant-colonel commandant: but I was each year more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
with the inn, the wine, the company, and the tireſome repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of annual attendance and daily exerciſe. At home, the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of the family and farm ſtill maintained the ſame creditable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.
My connection with Mrs. Gibbon was mellowed into a
warm and ſolid attachment: my growing years aboliſhed the diſtance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0112200701:155"/>
that might yet remain between a parent and a ſon, and my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſatisfied my father, who was proud of the ſucceſs, however
imperfect in his own life-time, of my literary talents. Our ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
was ſoon and often enlivened by the viſit of the friend of my
youth, Mr. Deyverdun, whoſe abſence from Lauſanne I had ſincerely
lamented. About three years after my firſt departure, he had emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated
from his native lake to the banks of the Oder in Germany.
The <hi>res anguſta domi,</hi> the waſte of a decent patrimony, by an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
father, obliged him, like many of his countrymen, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
in his own induſtry; and he was entruſted with the education
of a young prince, the grandſon of the Margrave of Schavedt, of
the Royal Family of Pruſſia. Our friendſhip was never cooled, our
correſpondence was ſometimes interrupted; but I rather wiſhed than
hoped to obtain Mr. Deyverdun for the companion of my Italian
tour. An unhappy, though honourable paſſion, drove him from his
German court; and the attractions of hope and curioſity were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by the expectation of my ſpeedy return to England. During
four ſucceſſive ſummers he paſſed ſeveral weeks or months at Beri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
and our free converſations, on every topic that could intereſt
the heart or underſtanding, would have reconciled me to a deſert or
a priſon. In the winter months of London my ſphere of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and action was ſomewhat enlarged, by the many new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
which I had contracted in the militia and abroad; and I
muſt regret, as more than an acquaintance, Mr. Godfrey Clarke of
Derbyſhire, an amiable and worthy young man, who was ſnatched
away by an untimely death. A weekly convivial meeting was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by myſelf and travellers, under the name of the Roman
Club<note n="*" place="bottom">The members were Lord Mountſtuart (now Earl of Bute), Colonel Edmonſtone, Weddal, Palgrave, Lord Berkley, Godfrey Clarke, Holroyd (Lord Sheſfield), Major Ridley, Sir William Guize, Sir John Aubrey, Lord Abingdon, Hon. Peregrine Bertie, Cleaver, Hon. John Damer, Hon. George Damer (Lord Milton), Sir Thomas Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coygne, Sir John Hort, E. Gibbon.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0112200701:156"/>
The renewal, or perhaps the improvement, of my Engliſh life
was embittered by the alteration of my own feelings. At the age
of twenty-one I was, in my proper ſtation of a youth, delivered
from the yoke of education, and delighted with the comparative
ſtate of liberty and affluence. My ſilial obedience was natural and
eaſy; and in the gay proſpect of futurity, my ambition did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
beyond the enjoyment of my books, my leiſure, and my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
eſtate, undiſturbed by the cares of a family and the duties
of a profeſſion. But in the militia I was armed with power; in my
travels, I was exempt from controul; and as I approached, as I
gradually paſſed my thirtieth year, I began to feel the deſire of
being maſter in my own houſe. The moſt gentle authority will
ſometimes frown without reaſon, the moſt cheerful ſubmiſſion will
ſometimes murmur without cauſe; and ſuch is the law of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
nature, that we muſt either command or obey; that our
perſonal liberty is ſupported by the obſequiouſneſs of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants.
While ſo many of my acquaintance were married or in
parliament, or advancing with a rapid ſtep in the various roads of
honour and fortune, I ſtood alone, immoveable and inſignificant;
for after the monthly meeting of 1770, I had even withdrawn my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the militia, by the reſignation of an empty and barren
commiſſion. My temper is not ſuſceptible of envy, and the view
of ſucceſsful merit has always excited my warmeſt applauſe. The
miſeries of a vacant life were never known to a man whoſe hours
were inſufficient for the inexhauſtible pleaſures of ſtudy. But I
lamented that at the proper age I had not embraced the lucrative
purſuits of the law or of trade, the chances of civil office or India
adventure, or even the fat ſlumbers of the church; and my repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
became more lively as the loſs of time was more irretrievable.
Experience ſhewed me the uſe of grafting my private conſequence
on the importance of a great profeſſional body; the benefits of thoſe
firm connections which are cemented by hope and intereſt, by grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0112200701:157"/>
and emulation, by the mutual exchange of ſervices and favours.
From the emoluments of a profeſſion I might have derived an ample
fortune, or a competent income, inſtead of being ſtinted to the ſame
narrow allowance, to be increaſed only by an event which I ſincerely
deprecated. The progreſs and the knowledge of our domeſtic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
aggravated my anxiety, and I began to apprehend that I
might be left in my old age without the fruits either of induſtry or
inheritance.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſummer after my return, whilſt I enjoyed at Beriton
the ſociety of my friend Deyverdun, our daily converſations expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
over the field of antient and modern literature; and we freely
diſcuſſed my ſtudies, my firſt Eſſay, and my future projects. The
Decline and Fall of Rome I ſtill contemplated at an awful diſtance:
but the two hiſtorical deſigns which had balanced my choice were
ſubmitted to his taſte; and in the parallel between the Revolutions
of Florence and Switzerland, our common partiality for a country
which was <hi>his</hi> by birth, and <hi>mine</hi> by adoption, inclined the ſcale in
favour of the latter. According to the plan, which was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and digeſted, I embraced a period of two hundred years,
from the aſſociation of the three peaſants of the Alps to the plenitude
and proſperity of the Helvetic body in the ſixteenth century. I
ſhould have deſcribed the deliverance and victory of the Swiſs, who
have never ſhed the blood of their tyrants but in a field of battle;
the laws and manners of the confederate ſtates; the ſplendid tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of the Auſtrian, Burgundian, and Italian wars; and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of a nation, who, after ſome ſallies of martial adventure, has
been content to guard the bleſſings of peace with the ſword of
freedom.</p>

            <p>My judgment, as well as my enthuſiaſm, was ſatisfied with the
glorious theme; and the aſſiſtance of Deyverdun ſeemed to remove
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0112200701:158"/>
an inſuperable obſtacle. The French or Latin memorials, of which
I was not ignorant, are inconſiderable in number and weight; but
in the perfect acquaintance of my friend with the German language,
I found the key of a more valuable collection. The moſt neceſſary
books were procured; he tranſlated, for my uſe, the folio volume of
Schilling, a copious and contemporary relation of the war of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy;
we read and marked the moſt intereſting parts of the great
chronicle of Tſchudi; and by his labour, or that of an inferior aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant,
large extracts were made from the Hiſtory of Lauffer and
the Dictionary of Lew: yet ſuch was the diſtance and delay, that
two years elapſed in theſe preparatory ſteps; and it was late in the
third ſummer (1767) before I entered, with theſe ſlender materials,
on the more agreeable taſk of compoſition. A ſpecimen of my
Hiſtory, the firſt book, was read the following winter in a literary
ſociety of foreigners in London; and as the author was unknown,
I liſtened, without obſervation, to the free ſtrictures, and unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

                        <p>It is but a few days ago ſince M. Deyverdun put your manuſcript into my hands, and I have peruſed it with great pleaſure and ſatisfaction. I have only one objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, derived from the language in which it is written. Why do you compoſe in French, and carry faggots into the wood, as Horace ſays with regard to Romans who wrote in Greek? I grant that you have a like motive to thoſe Romans, and adopt a language much more generally diffuſed than your native tongue: but have you not remarked the fate of thoſe two ancient languages in following ages? The Latin, though then leſs celebrated, and conſined to more narrow limits, has in ſome meaſure outlived the Greek, and is now more generally underſtood by men of letters. Let the French, therefore, triumph in the preſent diſſuſion of their tongue. Our ſolid and increaſing eſtabliſhments in America, where we need leſs dread the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Barbarians, promiſe a ſuperior ſtability and duration to the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                        <p>Your uſe of the French tongue has alſo led you into a ſtyle more poetical and figurative, and more highly coloured, than our language ſeems to admit of in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical productions: for ſuch is the practice of French writers, particularly the more recent ones, who illuminate their pictures more than cuſtom will permit us. On the whole, your Hiſtory, in my opinion, is written with ſpirit and judgment; and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you very earneſtly to continue it. The objections that occurred to me on reading it, were ſo frivolous, that I ſhall not trouble you with them, and ſhould, I believe, have a difficulty to recollect them. I am, with great eſteem,</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0112200701:159"/>
but their condemnation was ratified by my cooler thoughts.
I delivered my imperfect ſheets to the flames<note n="†" place="bottom">He neglected to burn them. He left at Sheffield-Place the introduction, or firſt book, in forty-three pages folio, written in a very ſmall hand, beſides a conſiderable number of notes. If Mr. Gibbon had not declared his judgment, perhaps Mr. Hume's opinion, expreſſed in the letter in the laſt note, might have juſtified the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it. S.</note>, and forever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a deſign in which ſome expence, much labour, and more
time, had been ſo vainly conſumed. I cannot regret the loſs of a
ſlight and ſuperficial eſſay; for ſuch the work muſt have been in
the hands of a ſtranger, uninformed by the ſcholars and ſtateſmen,
and remote from the libraries and archives of the Swiſs republics.
My antient habits, and the preſence of Deyverdun, encouraged me to
write in French for the continent of Europe; but I was conſcious
myſelf that my ſtyle, above proſe and below poetry, degenerated
into a verboſe and turgid declamation. Perhaps I may impute the
failure to the injudicious choice of a foreign language. Perhaps I
may ſuſpect that the language itſelf is ill adapted to ſuſtain the
vigour and dignity of an important narrative. But if France, ſo
rich in literary merit, had produced a great original hiſtorian, his
genius would have formed and fixed the idiom to the proper tone,
the peculiar mode of hiſtorical eloquence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0112200701:160"/>
It was in ſearch of ſome liberal and lucrative employment that my
friend Deyverdun had viſited England. His remittances from home
were ſcanty and precarious. My purſe was always open, but it was
often empty; and I bitterly felt the want of riches and power,
which might have enabled me to correct the errors of his fortune.
His wiſhes and qualifications ſolicited the ſtation of the travelling
governor of ſome wealthy pupil; but every vacancy provoked ſo
many eager candidates, that for a long time I ſtruggled without
ſucceſs; nor was it till after much application that I could even
place him as a clerk in the office of the ſecretary of ſtate. In a
reſidence of ſeveral years he never acquired the juſt pronunciation
and familiar uſe of the Engliſh tongue, but he read our moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
authors with eaſe and taſte: his critical knowledge of our
language and poetry was ſuch as few foreigners have poſſeſſed; and
few of our countrymen could enjoy the theatre of Shakeſpeare and
Garrick with more exquiſite feeling and diſcernment. The conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of his own ſtrength, and the aſſurance of my aid, embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
him to imitate the example of Dr. Maty, whoſe <hi>Journal Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannique</hi>
was eſteemed and regretted; and to improve his model, by
uniting with the tranſactions of literature a philoſophic view of the
arts and manners of the Britiſh nation. Our Journal for the year
1767, under the title of <hi>Memoires Literaires de la Grand Bretagne,</hi>
was ſoon finiſhed and ſent to the preſs. For the firſt article, Lord
Lyttelton's Hiſtory of Henry II. I muſt own myſelf reſponſible;
but the public has ratified my judgment of that voluminous work,
in which ſenſe and learning are not illuminated by a ray of genius.
The next ſpecimen was the choice of my friend, <hi>the Bath Guide,</hi>
a light and whimſical performance, of local, and even verbal, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry.
I ſtarted at the attempt: he ſmiled at my fears: his courage
was juſtified by ſucceſs; and a maſter of both languages will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
the curious felicity with which he has transfuſed into French
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0112200701:161"/>
proſe the ſpirit, and even the humour, of the Engliſh verſe. It is
not my wiſh to deny how deeply I was intereſted in theſe Memoirs,
of which I need not ſurely be aſhamed; but at the diſtance of more
than twenty years, it would be impoſſible for me to aſcertain the
reſpective ſhares of the two aſſociates. A long and intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of ideas had caſt our ſentiments and ſtyle in the ſame
mould. In our ſocial labours we compoſed and corrected by turns;
and the praiſe which I might honeſtly beſtow, would fall perhaps on
ſome article or paſſage moſt properly my own. A ſecond volume
(for the year 1768) was publiſhed of theſe Memoirs. I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to ſay, that their merit was ſuperior to their reputation; but it
is not leſs true, that they were productive of more reputation than
emolument. They introduced my friend to the protection, and
myſelf to the acquaintance, of the Earl of Cheſterfield, whoſe age
and infirmities ſecluded him from the world; and of Mr. David
Hume, who was under-ſecretary to the office in which Deyverdun
was more humbly employed. The former accepted a dedication,
(April 12th, 1769,) and reſerved the author for the future educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his ſucceſſor: the latter enriched the Journal with a reply
to Mr. Walpole's Hiſtorical Doubts, which he afterwards ſhaped
into the form of a note. The materials of the third volume were
almoſt completed, when I recommended Deyverdun as governor to
Sir Richard Worſley, a youth, the ſon of my old Lieutenant-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
who was lately deceaſed. They ſet forwards on their travels;
nor did they return to England till ſome time after my father's
death.</p>
            <p>My next publication was an accidental ſally of love and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
of my reverence for modeſt genius, and my averſion for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
pedantry. The ſixth book of the Aeneid is the moſt pleaſing
and perfect compoſition of Latin poetry. The deſcent of Aeneas
and the Sybil to the infernal regions, to the world of ſpirits, expands
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0112200701:162"/>
an awful and boundleſs proſpect, from the nocturnal gloom of the
Cumaean grot,
<q>Ibant obſcuri-ſolâ ſub nocte per umbram,</q>
to the meridian brightneſs of the Elyſian fields;
<q>
                  <l>Largior hic campos aether et lumine veſtit</l>
                  <l>Purpureo—</l>
               </q>
from the dreams of ſimple Nature, to the dreams, alas! of Egyptian
theology, and the philoſophy of the Greeks. But the final diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the hero through the ivory gate, whence
<q>Falſa ad coelum mittunt inſomnia manes,</q>
ſeems to diſſolve the whole enchantment, and leaves the reader in a
ſtate of cold and anxious ſcepticiſm. This moſt lame and impotent
concluſion has been variouſly imputed to the taſte or irreligion of
Virgil; but, according to the more elaborate interpretation of Biſhop
Warburton, the deſcent to hell is not a falſe, but a mimic ſcene;
which repreſents the initiation of Aeneas, in the character of a law-giver,
to the Eleuſinian myſteries. This hypotheſis, a ſingular
chapter in the Divine Legation of Moſes, had been admitted by
many as true; it was praiſed by all as ingenious; nor had it
been expoſed, in a ſpace of thirty years, to a fair and critical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.
The learning and the abilities of the author had raiſed
him to a juſt eminence; but he reigned the dictator and tyrant of
the world of literature. The real merit of Warburton was degraded
by the pride and preſumption with which he pronounced his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
decrees; in his polemic writings he laſhed his antagoniſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy or moderation; and his ſervile flatterers, (ſee the baſe and
malignant Eſſay on the <hi>Delicacy of Friendſhip,</hi>) exalting the maſter
critic far above Ariſtotle and Longinus, aſſaulted every modeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter
who refuſed to conſult the oracle, and to adore the idol. In
a land of liberty, ſuch deſpotiſm muſt provoke a general oppoſition,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0112200701:163"/>
and the zeal of oppoſition is ſeldom candid or impartial. A late
profeſſor of Oxford, (Dr. Lowth,) in a pointed and poliſhed epiſtle,
(Auguſt 31ſt, 1765,) defended himſelf, and attacked the Biſhop;
and, whatſoever might be the merits of an inſignificant controverſy,
his victory was clearly eſtabliſhed by the ſilent confuſion of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton
and his ſlaves. <hi>I</hi> too, without any private offence, was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of breaking a lance againſt the giant's ſhield; and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the year 1770, my Critical Obſervations on the Sixth
Book of the Aeneid were ſent, without my name, to the preſs. In
this ſhort Eſſay, my firſt Engliſh publication, I aimed my ſtrokes
againſt the perſon and the hypotheſis of Biſhop Warburton. I
proved, at leaſt to my own ſatisfaction, <hi>that</hi> the antient lawgivers
did not invent the myſteries, and <hi>that</hi> Aeneas was never inveſted
with the office of lawgiver: <hi>that</hi> there is not any argument, any
circumſtance, which can melt a fable into allegory, or remove the
ſeene from the Lake Avernus to the Temple of Ceres: <hi>that</hi> ſuch a
wild ſuppoſition is equally injurious to the poet and the man: <hi>that</hi>
if Virgil was not initiated he could not, if he were he would not,
reveal the ſecrets of the initiation: <hi>that</hi> the anathema of Horace
(<hi>vetabo qui Cereris ſacrum vulgarit, &amp;c.</hi>) at once atteſts his own
ignorance and the innocence of his friend. As the Biſhop of
Glouceſter and his party maintained a diſcreet ſilence, my critical
diſquiſition was ſoon loſt among the pamphlets of the day; but the
public coldneſs was overbalanced to my feelings by the weighty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the laſt and beſt editor of Virgil, Profeſſor Heyne of
Gottingen, who acquieſces in my confutation, and ſtiles the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
author, <hi>doctus—et elegantiſſimus Britannus.</hi> But I cannot
reſiſt the temptation of tranſcribing the favourable judgment of Mr.
Hayley, himſelf a poet and a ſcholar: <q>An intricate hypotheſis,
twiſted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Diſſertation on the Sixth Book of Virgil, remained
ſome time unrefuted.—At length, a ſuperior, but anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,

critic aroſe, who, in one of the moſt judicious and ſpirited
eſſays that our nation has produced, on a point of claſſical litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
completely overturned this ill-founded edifice, and expoſed
the arrogance and futility of its aſſuming architect.</q> He even
condeſcends to juſtify an acrimony of ſtyle, which had been gently

            <p>In the fifteen years between my Eſſay on the Study of Literature
and the firſt volume of the Decline and Fall, (1761—1776,) this
criticiſm on Warburton, and ſome articles in the Journal, were my
ſole publications. It is more eſpecially incumbent on me to mark
the employment, or to confeſs the waſte of time, from my travels
to my father's death, an interval in which I was not diverted by
any profeſſional duties from the labours and pleaſures of a ſtudious
life. 1. As ſoon as I was releaſed from the fruitleſs taſk of the
Swiſs revolutions, (1768,) I began gradually to advance from the
wiſh to the hope, from the hope to the deſign, from the deſign to
the execution, of my hiſtorical work, of whoſe limits and extent I
had yet a very inadequate notion. The Claſſics, as low as Tacitus,
the younger Pliny, and Juvenal, were my old and familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0112200701:165"/>
I inſenſibly plunged into the ocean of the Auguſtan hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
and in the deſcending ſeries I inveſtigated, with my pen
almoſt always in my hand, the original records, both Greek and
Latin, from Dion Caſſius to Ammianus Marcellinus, from the reign
of Trajan to the laſt age of the Weſtern Caeſars. The ſubſidiary
rays of medals, and inſcriptions of geography and chronology,
were thrown on their proper objects; and I applied the collections
of Tillemont, whoſe inimitable accuracy almoſt aſſumes the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of genius, to fix and arrange within my reach the looſe and
ſcattered atoms of hiſtorical information. Through the darkneſs of
the middle ages I explored my way in the Annals and Antiquities of
Italy of the learned Muratori; and diligently compared them with
the parallel or tranſverſe lines of Sigonius and Maffei, Baronius and
Pagi, till I almoſt graſped the ruins of Rome in the fourteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
without ſuſpecting that this final chapter muſt be attained by
the labour of ſix quartos and twenty years. Among the books
which I purchaſed, the Theodocian Code, with the commentary of
James Godefroy, muſt be gratefully remembered. I uſed it (and much
I uſed it) as a work of hiſtory, rather than of juriſprudence: but
in every light it may be conſidered as a full and capacious repoſitory
of the political ſtate of the empire in the fourth and fifth centuries.
As I believed, and as I ſtill believe, that the propagation of the
Goſpel, and the triumph of the church, are inſeparably connected
with the decline of the Roman monarchy, I weighed the cauſes
and effects of the revolution, and contraſted the narratives and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
of the Chriſtians themſelves, with the glances of candour or
enmity which the Pagans have caſt on the riſing ſects. The Jewiſh
and Heathen teſtimonies, as they are collected and illuſtrated by Dr.
Lardner, directed, without ſuperſeding, my ſearch of the originals;
and in an ample diſſertation on the miraculous darkneſs of the
paſſion, I privately withdrew my concluſions from the ſilence of an
unbelieving age. I have aſſembled the preparatory ſtudies, directly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0112200701:166"/>
or indirectly relative to my hiſtory; but, in ſtrict equity, they muſt
be ſpread beyond this period of my life, over the two ſummers
(1771 and 1772) that elapſed between my father's death and my
ſettlement in London. 2. In a free converſation with books and
men, it would be endleſs to enumerate the names and characters of
all who are introduced to our acquaintance; but in this general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
we may ſelect the degrees of friendſhip and eſteem, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the wiſe maxim, <hi>Multum legere potius quam multa.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed,
again and again, the immortal works of the French and
Engliſh, the Latin and Italian claſſics. My Greek ſtudies (though
leſs aſſiduous than I deſigned) maintained and extended my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that incomparable idiom. Homer and Xenophon were ſtill
my favourite authors; and I had almoſt prepared for the preſs an
Eſſay on the Cyropoedia, which, in my own judgment, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
laboured. After a certain age, the new publications of merit
are the ſole food of the many; and the moſt auſtere ſtudent will be
often tempted to break the line, for the ſake of indulging his own
curioſity, and of providing the topics of faſhionable currency. A more
reſpectable motive may be aſſigned for the third peruſal of Blackſtone's
Commentaries, and a copious and critical abſtract of that Engliſh
work was my firſt ſerious production in my native language.
3. My literary leiſure was much leſs complete and independent than
it might appear to the eye of a ſtranger. In the hurry of London I
was deſtitute of books; in the ſolitude of Hampſhire I was not
maſter of my time. My quiet was gradually diſturbed by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
anxiety, and I ſhould be aſhamed of my unfeeling philoſophy,
had I found much time or taſte for ſtudy in the laſt fatal ſummer
(1772) of my father's decay and diſſolution.</p>
            <p>The diſembodying of the militia at the cloſe of the war (1763)
had reſtored the Major (a new Cincinnatus) to a life of agriculture.
His labours were uſeful, his pleaſures innocent, his wiſhes mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
and my father <hi>ſeemed</hi> to enjoy the ſtate of happineſs which is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0112200701:167"/>
celebrated by poets and philoſophers, as the moſt agreeable to nature,

            <p>But the laſt indiſpenſable condition, the freedom from debt, was
wanting to my father's felicity; and the vanities of his youth were
ſeverely puniſhed by the ſolicitude and ſorrow of his declining age.
The firſt mortgage, on my return from Lauſanne, (1758,) had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
him a partial and tranſient relief. The annual demand of
intereſt and allowance was a heavy deduction from his income; the
militia was a ſource of expence, the farm in his hands was not a
profitable adventure, he was loaded with the coſts and damages of
an obſolete law-ſuit; and each year multiplied the number, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
the patience, of his creditors. Under theſe painful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
I conſented to an additional mortgage, to the ſale of Putney,
and to every ſacrifice that could alleviate his diſtreſs. But he was
no longer capable of a rational effort, and his reluctant delays poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
not the evils themſelves, but the remedies of thoſe evils (<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media
malorum potius quam mala differebat</hi>). The pangs of ſhame,
tenderneſs, and ſelf-reproach, inceſſantly preyed on his vitals; his
conſtitution was broken; he loſt his ſtrength and his ſight; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
progreſs of a dropſy admoniſhed him of his end, and he ſunk
into the grave on the 10th of November 1770, in the ſixty-fourth
year of his age. A family-tradition inſinuates that Mr. William
Law had drawn his pupil in the light and inconſtant character of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0112200701:168"/>
               <hi>Flatus,</hi> who is ever confident, and ever diſappointed in the chace of

by the virtues of the head and heart, by the warmeſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of honour and humanity. His graceful perſon, polite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
gentle manners, and unaffected cheerfulneſs, recommended
him to the favour of every company; and in the change of
times and opinions, his liberal ſpirit had long ſince delivered him
from the zeal and prejudice of a Tory education. I ſubmitted to
the order of Nature; and my grief was ſoothed by the conſcious
ſatisfaction that I had diſcharged all the duties of filial piety.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had paid the laſt ſolemn duties to my father, and
obtained, from time and reaſon, a tolerable compoſure of mind, I
began to form the plan of an independent life, moſt adapted to my
circumſtances and inclination. Yet ſo intricate was the net, my ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
were ſo awkward and feeble, that nearly two years (November
1770—October 1772) were ſuffered to elapſe before I could diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
myſelf from the management of the farm, and transfer my
reſidence from Beriton to a houſe in London. During this interval
I continued to divide my year between town and the country; but
my new ſituation was brightened by hope; my ſtay in London was
prolonged into the ſummer; and the uniformity of the ſummer was
occaſionally broken by viſits and excurſions at a diſtance from home.
The gratification of my deſires (they were not immoderate) has been
ſeldom diſappointed by the want of money or credit; my pride
was never inſulted by the viſit of an importunate tradeſman; and
my tranſient anxiety for the paſt or future has been diſpelled by the
ſtudious or ſocial occupation of the preſent hour. My conſcience
does not accuſe me of any act of extravagance or injuſtice, and the
remnant of my eſtate affords an ample and honourable proviſion for
my declining age. I ſhall not expatiate on my oeconomical affairs,
which cannot be inſtructive or amuſing to the reader. It is a rule
of prudence, as well as of politeneſs, to reſerve ſuch confidence for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0112200701:169"/>
the ear of a private friend, without expoſing our ſituation to the
envy or pity of ſtrangers; for envy is productive of hatred, and
pity borders too nearly on contempt. Yet I may believe, and even
aſſert, that in circumſtances more indigent or more wealthy, I ſhould
never have accompliſhed the taſk, or acquired the fame, of an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian;
that my ſpirit would have been broken by poverty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and that my induſtry might have been relaxed in the labour
and luxury of a ſuperfluous fortune.</p>
            <p>I had now attained the firſt of earthly bleſſings, independence: I
was the abſolute maſter of my hours and actions: nor was I deceived
in the hope that the eſtabliſhment of my library in town would allow
me to divide the day between ſtudy and ſociety. Each year the circle
of my acquaintance, the number of my dead and living companions,
was enlarged. To a lover of books, the ſhops and ſales of London
preſent irreſiſtible temptations; and the manufacture of my hiſtory
required a various and growing ſtock of materials. The militia, my
travels, the Houſe of Commons, the fame of an author, contributed
to multiply my connections: I was choſen a member of the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
clubs; and, before I left England in 1783, there were few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of any eminence in the literary or political world to whom I
was a ſtranger<note n="*" place="bottom">From the mixed, though polite, company of Boodle's, White's, and Brooks's, I muſt honourably diſtinguiſh a weekly ſociety, which was inſtituted in the year 1764, and which ſtill continues to flouriſh, under the title of the Literary Club. (Hawkins's Life of Johnſon, p. 415. Boſwell's Tour to the Hebrides, p. 97.) The names of Dr. Johnſon, Mr. Burke, Mr. Topham Beauclerc, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldſmith, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Colman, Sir William Jones, Dr. Percy, Mr. Fox, Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan, Mr. Adam Smith, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Dunning, Sir Joſeph Banks, Dr. Warton, and his brother Mr. Thomas Warton, Dr. Burney, &amp;c. form a large and luminous conſtellation of Britiſh ſtars.</note>. It would moſt aſſuredly be in my power to amuſe
the reader with a gallery of portraits and a collection of anecdotes.
But I have always condemned the practice of transforming a private
memorial into a vehicle of ſatire or praiſe. By my own choice I
paſſed in town the greateſt part of the year; but whenever I was
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0112200701:170"/>
deſirous of breathing the air of the country, I poſſeſſed an hoſpitable
retreat at Sheffield-place in Suſſex, in the family of my valuable
friend Mr. Holroyd, whoſe character, under the name of Lord
Sheffield, has ſince been more conſpicuous to the public.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was I ſettled in my houſe and library, than I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the compoſition of the firſt volume of my Hiſtory. At the
outſet all was dark and doubtful; even the title of the work, the
true aera of the Decline and Fall of the Empire, the limits of the
introduction, the diviſion of the chapters, and the order of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative;
and I was often tempted to caſt away the labour of ſeven
years. The ſtyle of an author ſhould be the image of his mind, but
the choice and command of language is the fruit of exerciſe. Many
experiments were made before I could hit the middle tone between
a dull chronicle and a rhetorical declamation: three times did I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the firſt chapter, and twice the ſecond and third, before I was
tolerably ſatisfied with their effect. In the remainder of the way I
advanced with a more equal and eaſy pace; but the fifteenth and
ſixteenth chapters have been reduced by three ſucceſſive reviſals, from
a large volume to their preſent ſize; and they might ſtill be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
without any loſs of facts or ſentiments. An oppoſite fault
may be imputed to the conciſe and ſuperficial narrative of the firſt
reigns from Commodus to Alexander; a fault of which I have never
heard, except from Mr. Hume in his laſt journey to London. Such
an oracle might have been conſulted and obeyed with rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
but I was ſoon diſguſted with the modeſt practice of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manuſcript to my friends. Of ſuch friends ſome will
praiſe from politeneſs, and ſome will criticiſe from vanity. The
author himſelf is the beſt judge of his own performance; no one has
ſo deeply meditated on the ſubject; no one is ſo ſincerely intereſted
in the event.</p>
            <p>By the friendſhip of Mr. (now Lord) Eliot, who had married my
firſt couſin, I was returned at the general election. for the borough
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0112200701:171"/>
of Leſkeard. I took my ſeat at the beginning of the memorable
conteſt between Great Britain and America, and ſupported, with
many a ſincere and ſilent vote, the rights, though not, perhaps, the
intereſt, of the mother country. After a fleeting illuſive hope, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
condemned me to acquieſce in the humble ſtation of a mute.
I was not armed by Nature and education with the intrepid energy
of mind and voice.</p>
            <q>Vincentem ſtrepitus, et natum rebus agendis.</q>
            <p>Timidity was fortified by pride, and even the ſucceſs of my pen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
the trial of my voice<note n="*" place="bottom">A French ſketch of Mr. Gibbon's Life, written by himſelf, probably for the uſe of ſome foreign journaliſt or tranſlator, contains no fact not mentioned in his Engliſh Life. He there deſcribes himſelf with his uſual candour. Depuis huit ans il a aſſiſté aux deliberations les plus importantes, mais il ne s'eſt jamais trouvé <hi>le courage,</hi> ni <hi>le talent,</hi> de parler dans une aſſemblée publique. This ſketch was written before the publication of his three laſt volumes, as in cloſing it he ſays of his Hiſtory: Cette entrepriſe lui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande encore pluſieurs années d'une application ſoutenue; mais quelqu'en ſoit le ſuccès, il trouve dans cette application même un plaiſir toujours varié et toujours renaiſſant.</note>. But I aſſiſted at the debates of a
free aſſembly; I liſtened to the attack and defence of eloquence and
reaſon; I had a near proſpect of the characters, views, and paſſions
of the firſt men of the age. The cauſe of government was ably
vindicated by <hi>Lord North,</hi> a ſtateſman of ſpotleſs integrity, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate
maſter of debate, who could wield, with equal dexterity,
the arms of reaſon and of ridicule. He was ſeated on the Treaſury-bench
between his Attorney and Solicitor General, the two pillars
of the law and ſtate, <hi>magis pares quam ſimiles;</hi> and the miniſter might
indulge in a ſhort ſlumber, whilſt he was upholden on either hand
by the majeſtic ſenſe of <hi>Thurlow,</hi> and the ſkilful eloquence of <hi>Wedder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</hi>
From the adverſe ſide of the houſe an ardent and powerful
oppoſition was ſupported, by the lively declamation of <hi>Barré,</hi> the
legal acuteneſs of <hi>Dunning,</hi> the profuſe and philoſophic fancy of
<hi>Burke,</hi> and the argumentative vehemence of <hi>Fox,</hi> who in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a party approved himſelf equal to the conduct of an empire.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0112200701:172"/>
By ſuch men every operation of peace and war, every principle
of juſtice or policy, every queſtion of authority and freedom, was
attacked and defended; and the ſubject of the momentous conteſt
was the union or ſeparation of Great Britain and America. The
eight ſeſſions that I ſat in parliament were a ſchool of civil pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the firſt and moſt eſſential virtue of an hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>The volume of my Hiſtory, which had been ſomewhat delayed
by the novelty and tumult of a firſt ſeſſion, was now ready for
the preſs. After the perilous adventure had been declined by my
friend Mr. Elmſly, I agreed, upon eaſy terms, with Mr. Thomas
Cadell, a reſpectable bookſeller, and Mr. William Strahan, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
printer; and they undertook the care and riſk of the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which derived more credit from the name of the ſhop than
from that of the author. The laſt reviſal of the proofs was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to my vigilance; and many blemiſhes of ſtyle, which had
been inviſible in the manuſcript, were diſcovered and corrected in
the printed ſheet. So moderate were our hopes, that the original
impreſſion had been ſtinted to five hundred, till the number was
doubled by the prophetic taſte of Mr. Strahan. During this awful
interval I was neither elated by the ambition of fame, nor depreſſed
by the apprehenſion of contempt. My diligence and accuracy were
atteſted by my own conſcience. Hiſtory is the moſt popular ſpecies
of writing, ſince it can adapt itſelf to the higheſt or the loweſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.
I had choſen an illuſtrious ſubject. Rome is familiar to
the ſchool-boy and the ſtateſman; and my narrative was deduced
from the laſt period of claſſical reading. I had likewiſe flattered
myſelf, that an age of light and liberty would receive, without ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
an inquiry into the human <hi>cauſes</hi> of the progreſs and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I am at a loſs how to deſcribe the ſucceſs of the work, without
betraying the vanity of the writer. The firſt impreſſion was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauſted
in a few days; a ſecond and third edition were ſcarcely
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0112200701:173"/>
adequate to the demand; and the bookſeller's property was twice
invaded by the pirates of Dublin. My book was on every table,
and almoſt on every toilette; the hiſtorian was crowned by the taſte
or faſhion of the day; nor was the general voice diſturbed by the
barking of any <hi>profane</hi> critic. The favour of mankind is moſt freely
beſtowed on a new acquaintance of any original merit; and the
mutual ſurprize of the public and their favourite is productive of
thoſe warm ſenſibilities, which at a ſecond meeting can no longer be
rekindled. If I liſtened to the muſic of praiſe, I was more ſeriouſly
ſatisfied with the approbation of my judges. The candour of Dr.
Robertſon embraced his diſciple. A letter from Mr. Hume overpaid
the labour of ten years; but I have never preſumed to accept a
place in the triumvirate of Britiſh hiſtorians.</p>
            <p>That curious and original letter will amuſe the reader, and his
gratitude ſhould ſhield my free communication from the reproach of
vanity.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>As I ran through your volume of hiſtory with great avidity and
impatience, I cannot forbear diſcovering ſomewhat of the ſame impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in returning you thanks for your agreeable preſent, and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſatisfaction which the performance has given me. Whether
I conſider the dignity of your ſtyle, the depth of your matter, or the
extenſiveneſs of your learning, I muſt regard the work as equally
the object of eſteem; and I own that if I had not previouſly had
the happineſs of your perſonal acquaintance, ſuch a performance
from an Engliſhman in our age would have given me ſome ſurprize.
You may ſmile at this ſentiment; but as it ſeems to me that your
countrymen, for almoſt a whole generation, have given themſelves
up to barbarous and abſurd faction, and have totally neglected all
polite letters, I no longer expected any valuable production ever to
come from them. I know it will give you pleaſure (as it did me)
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0112200701:174"/>
to find that all the men of letters in this place concur in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of your work, and in their anxious deſire of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
it.</p>
                  <p>When I heard of your undertaking, (which was ſome time ago,)
I own I was a little curious to ſee how you would extricate yourſelf
from the ſubject of your two laſt chapters. I think you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a very prudent temperament; but it was impoſſible to treat
the ſubject ſo as not to give grounds of ſuſpicion againſt you, and
you may expect that a clamour will ariſe. This, if any thing, will
retard your ſucceſs with the public; for in every other reſpect your
work is calculated to be popular. But among many other marks of
decline, the prevalence of ſuperſtition in England prognoſticates the
fall of philoſophy and decay of taſte; and though nobody be more
capable than you to revive them, you will probably find a ſtruggle
in your firſt advances.</p>
                  <p>I ſee you entertain a great doubt with regard to the authenticity
of the poems of Oſſian. You are certainly right in ſo doing. It is
indeed ſtrange that any men of ſenſe could have imagined it poſſible,
that above twenty thouſand verſes, along with numberleſs hiſtorical
facts, could have been preſerved by oral tradition during fifty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
by the rudeſt, perhaps, of all the European nations, the
moſt neceſſitous, the moſt turbulent, and the moſt unſettled. Where
a ſuppoſition is ſo contrary to common ſenſe, any poſitive evidence
of it ought never to be regarded: Men run with great avidity to
give their evidence in favour of what flatters their paſſions and their
national prejudices. You are therefore over and above indulgent to
us in ſpeaking of the matter with heſitation.</p>
                  <p>I muſt inform you that we are all very anxious to hear that you
have fully collected the materials for your ſecond volume, and that
you are even conſiderably advanced in the compoſition of it. I ſpeak
this more in the name of my friends than in my own; as I cannot
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0112200701:175"/>
expect to live ſo long as to ſee the publication of it. Your enſuing
volume will be more delicate than the preceding, but I truſt in your
prudence for extricating you from the difficulties; and, in all
events, you have courage to deſpiſe the clamour of bigots.</p>
                  <closer>I am, with great regard,
<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                     <signed>Your moſt obedient, and moſt humble Servant,
DAVID HUME.</signed>

            <p>Some weeks afterwards I had the melancholy pleaſure of ſeeing
Mr. Hume in his paſſage through London; his body feeble, his
mind firm. On the 25th of Auguſt of the ſame year (1776) he
died, at Edinburgh, the death of a philoſopher.</p>
            <p>My ſecond excurſion to Paris was determined by the preſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
of M. and Madame Necker, who had viſited England in
the preceding ſummer. On my arrival I found M. Necker Director-general
of the finances, in the firſt bloom of power and popularity.
His private fortune enabled him to ſupport a liberal eſtabliſhment;
and his wife, whoſe talents and virtues I had long admired, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
qualified to preſide in the converſation of her table and
drawing-room. As their friend, I was introduced to the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of both ſexes; to the foreign miniſters of all nations, and to
the firſt names and characters of France; who diſtinguiſhed me by
ſuch marks of civility and kindneſs, as gratitude will not ſuffer me
to forget, and modeſty will not allow me to enumerate. The
faſhionable ſuppers often broke into the morning hours; yet I occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
conſulted the Royal Library, and that of the Abbey of
St. Germain, and in the free uſe of their books at home, I had
always reaſon to praiſe the liberality of thoſe inſtitutions. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men of letters I neither courted nor declined; but I was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0112200701:176"/>
happy in the acquaintance of M. de Buffon, who united with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime
genius the moſt amiable ſimplicity of mind and manners.
At the table of my old friend, M. de Foncemagne, I was involved
in a diſpute with the Abbé de Mably; and his jealous iraſcible ſpirit
revenged itſelf on a work which he was incapable of reading in the
original.</p>
            <p>As I might be partial in my own cauſe, I ſhall tranſcribe the words
of an unknown critic, obſerving only, that this diſpute had been
preceded by another on the Engliſh conſtitution, at the houſe of the
Counteſs de Froulay, an old Janſeniſt lady.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Vous étiez chez M. de Foncemagne, mon cher Theodon, le jour
que M. l'Abbé de Mably et M. Gibbon y dinerent en grande com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnie.
La converſation roula preſque entièrement ſur l'hiſtoire.
L'Abbé etant un profond politique, la tourna ſur l'adminiſtration,
quand on fut au deſert: et comme par caractère, par humeur,
par l'habitude d'admirer Tite Live, il ne priſe que le ſyſtême re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicain,
il ſe mit à vanter l'excellence des republiques; bien
perſuadé que le ſavant Anglois l'approuveroit en tout, et admireroit
la profondeur de génie qui avoit fait deviner tous ces avantages à
un François. Mais M. Gibbon, inſtruit par l'experience des in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniens
d'un gouvernement populaire, ne fut point du tout de
ſon avis, et il prit généreuſement la défenſe du gouvernement mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchique.
L'Abbé voulut le convaincre par Tite Live, et par
quelques argumens tirés de Plutarque en faveur des Spartiates.
M. Gibbon, doué de la memoire la plus heureuſe, et ayant tous lès
faits preſens à la penſée, domina bien-tot la converſation; l'Abbé ſe
facha, il s'emporta, il dit des choſes dures; l'Anglois, conſervant le
phlegme de ſon pays, prenoit ſes avantages, et preſſoit l'Abbé avee
d'autant plus de ſuccès que la colere le troubloit de plus en plus.
La converſation s'echauffoit, et M. de Foncemagne la rompit en ſe
levant de table, et en paſſant dans le ſalon, où perſonne ne fut tenté

Mably was a lover of virtue and freedom; but his virtue was auſtere, and his freedom was impatient of an equal.

            </p>
            <p>Nearly two years had elapſed between the publication of my firſt
and the commencément of my ſecond volume; and the cauſes muſt
be aſſigned of this long delay. 1. After a ſhort holiday, I indulged
my curioſity in ſome ſtudies of a very different nature, a courſe of
anatomy, which was demonſtrated by Doctor Hunter; and ſome
leſſons of chymiſtry, which were delivered by Mr. Higgins. The
principles of theſe ſciences, and taſte for books of natural hiſtory,
contributed to multiply my ideas and images; and the anatomiſt and
chymiſt may ſometimes track me in their own ſnow. 2. I dived,
perhaps too deeply, into the mud of the Arian controverſy; and
many days of reading, thinking, and writing were conſumed in the
purſuit of a phantom. 3. It is difficult to arrange, with order and
perſpicuity, the various tranſactions of the age of Conſtantine; and
ſo much was I diſpleaſed with the firſt eſſay, that I committed to the
flames above fifty ſheets. 4. The ſix months of Paris and pleaſure
muſt be deducted from the account. But when I reſumed my taſk
I felt my improvement; I was now maſter of my ſtyle and ſubject,
and while the meaſure of my daily performance was enlarged, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0112200701:178"/>
leſs reaſon to cancel or correct. It has always been my
practice to caſt a long paragraph in a ſingle mould, to try it by my
ear, to depoſit it in my memory, but to ſuſpend the action of the
pen till I had given the laſt poliſh to my work. Shall I add, that I
never found my mind more vigorous, nor my compoſition more
happy, than in the winter hurry of ſociety and parliament?</p>
            <p>Had I believed that the majority of Engliſh readers were ſo fondly
attached even to the name and ſhadow of Chriſtianity; had I foreſcen
that the pious, the timid, and the prudent, would feel, or affect to
feel, with ſuch exquiſite ſenſibility; I might, perhaps, have ſoſtened
the two invidious chapters, which would create many enemies, and
conciliate few friends. But the ſhaft was ſhot, the alarm was ſounded,
and I could only rejoice, that if the voice of our prieſts was clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and bitter, their hands were diſarmed from the powers of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.
I adhered to the wiſe reſolution of truſting myſelf and
my writings to the candour of the public, till Mr. Davies of Oxford
preſumed to attack, not the faith, but the fidelity, of the hiſtorian.
<hi>My Vindication,</hi> expreſſive of leſs anger than contempt, amuſed for
a moment the buſy and idle metropolis; and the moſt rational part
of the laity, and even of the clergy, appear to have been ſatisfied
of my innocence and accuracy. I would not print this Vindication in
quarto, leſt it ſhould be bound and preſerved with the hiſtory itſelf. At
the diſtance of twelve years, I calmly affirm my judgment of Davies,
Chelſum, &amp;c. A victory over ſuch antagoniſts was a ſufficient hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.
They, however, were rewarded in this world. Poor
Chelſum was indeed neglected; and I dare not boaſt the making

and his trumpet of ſedition may at length awaken the magiſtrates of

            <p>The profeſſion and rank of Sir David Dalrymple (now a Lord of
Seſſion) has given a more decent colour to his ſtyle. But he ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinized
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0112200701:180"/>
each ſeparate paſſage of the two chapters with the dry mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs
of a ſpecial pleader; and as he was always ſolicitous to
make, he may have ſucceeded ſometimes in finding, a flaw. In his
Annals of Scotland, he has ſhewn himſelf a diligent collector and an
accurate critic.</p>
            <p>I have praiſed, and I ſtill praiſe, the eloquent ſermons which were
preached in St. Mary's pulpit at Oxford by Dr. White. If he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
me with ſome degree of illiberal acrimony, in ſuch a place,
and before ſuch an audience, he was obliged to ſpeak the language
of the country. I ſmiled at a paſſage in one of his private letters to
Mr. Badcock; <q>The part where we encounter Gibbon muſt be
brilliant and ſtriking.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a ſermon preached before the univerſity of Cambridge, Dr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
complimented a work, <q>which can only periſh with the
language itſelf;</q> and eſteems the author a formidable enemy. He
is, indeed, aſtoniſhed that more learning and ingenuity has not been
ſhewn in the defence of Iſrael; that the prelates and dignitaries of
the church (alas, good man!) did not vie with each other, whoſe
ſtone ſhould ſink the deepeſt in the forehead of this Goliah.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But the force of truth will oblige us to confeſs, that in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
which have been levelled againſt our ſceptical hiſtorian, we
can diſcover but ſlender traces of profound and exquiſite erudition,
of ſolid criticiſm and accurate inveſtigation; but we are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
diſguſted by vague and inconcluſive reaſoning; by unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
banter and ſenſeleſs witticiſms; by imbittered bigotry and
enthuſiaſtic jargon; by futile cavils and illiberal invectives. Proud
and elated by the weakneſs of his antagoniſts, he condeſcends not
to handle the ſword of controverſy<note n="*" place="bottom">Monthly Review, Oct. 1790.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let me frankly own that I was ſtartled at the firſt diſcharge of
eccleſiaſtical ordnance; but as ſoon as I found that this empty noiſe
was miſchievous only in the intention, my fear was converted into
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0112200701:181"/>
indignation; and every feeling of indignation or curioſity has long
ſince ſubſided in pure and placid indifference.</p>
            <p>The proſecution of my hiſtory was ſoon afterwards checked by
another controverſy of a very different kind. At the requeſt of the
Lord Chancellor, and of Lord Weymouth, then Secretary of State,
I vindicated, againſt the French manifeſto, the juſtice of the Britiſh
arms. The whole correſpondence of Lord Stormont, our late am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
at Paris, was ſubmitted to my inſpection, and the <hi>Memoire
Juſtificatif,</hi> which I compoſed in French, was firſt approved by the
Cabinet Miniſters, and then delivered as a ſtate paper to the courts
of Europe. The ſtyle and manner are praiſed by Beaumarchais
himſelf, who, in his private quarrel, attempted a reply; but he
flatters me, by aſcribing the memoir to Lord Stormont; and the
groſſneſs of his invective betrays the loſs of temper and of wit; he
acknowledged<note n="*" place="bottom">Oeuvres de Beaumarchais, tom. iii. p. 299. 355.</note>, that <hi>le ſtyle ne ſeroit pas ſans grace, ni la logique
ſans juſteſſe,</hi> &amp;c. if the facts were true which he undertakes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
For theſe facts my credit is not pledged; I ſpoke as a
lawyer from my brief, but the veracity of Beaumarchais may be
eſtimated from the aſſertion that France, by the treaty of Paris
(1763), was limited to a certain number of ſhips of war. On the
application of the Duke of Choiſeul, he was obliged to retract this
daring falſehood.</p>
            <p>Among the honourable connections which I had formed, I may
juſtly be proud of the friendſhip of Mr. Wedderburne, at that time
Attorney General, who now illuſtrates the title of Lord Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
and the office of Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas. By
his ſtrong recommendation, and the favourable diſpoſition of Lord
North, I was appointed one of the Lords Commiſſioners of Trade
and Plantations; and my private income was enlarged by a clear
addition of between ſeven and eight hundred pounds a-year. The
fancy of an hoſtile orator may paint, in the ſtrong colours of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0112200701:182"/>
               <q>the perpetual virtual adjournment, and the unbroken ſitting

The Lords of Trade bluſhed at their inſignificancy, and Mr. Eden's appeal to the two thouſand five hundred volumes of our Reports, ſerved only to excite a general laugh.

                        <p>Yeſterday I received a very intereſting communication from my friend, whoſe kind and honourable behaviour towards me I muſt always remember with the higheſt gratitude. He informed me that, in conſequence of an arrangement, a place at the Board of Trade was reſerved for me, and that as ſoon as I ſignified my acceptance of it, he was ſatisfied no farther difficulties would ariſe. My anſwer to him was ſincere and explicit. I told him that I was far from approving all the paſt meaſures of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, even ſome of thoſe in which I myſelf had ſilently concurred; that I ſaw, with the reſt of the world, many capital defects in the characters of ſome of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſters, and was ſorry that in ſo alarming a ſituation of public affairs, the country had not the aſſiſtance of ſeveral able and honeſt men who are now in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But that I had not formed with any of thoſe perſons in oppoſition any engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or connections which could in the leaſt reſtrain or affect my parliamentary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; that I could not diſcover among them ſuch ſuperior advantages, either of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or of abilities, as could make me conſider it as a duty to attach myſelf to their cauſe; and that I clearly underſtood, from the public and private language of—, one of their leaders, that in the actual ſtate of the country, he himſelf was ſeriouſly of opinion that oppoſition could not tend to any good purpoſe, and might be productive of much miſchief; that, for thoſe reaſons, I ſaw no objections which could prevent me from accepting an office under the preſent government, and that I was ready to take a ſtep which I found to be conſiſtent both with my intereſt and my honour.</p>
                        <p>It muſt now be decided, whether I may continue to live in England, or whether I muſt ſoon withdraw myſelf into a kind of philoſophical exile in Switzerland. My father left his affairs in a ſtate of embarraſſment, and even of diſtreſs. My attempts to diſpoſe of a part of my landed property have hitherto been diſappointed, and are not likely at preſent to be more ſucceſsful: and my plan of expence, though moderate in itſelf, deſerves the name of extravagance, ſince it exceeds my real income. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſalary which is now offered will make my ſituation perfectly eaſy; but I hope you will do me the juſtice to believe that my mind could not be ſo, unleſs I were ſatisfied of the rectitude of my own conduct.</p>

The aſpect of the next ſeſſion of parliament was ſtormy and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous;
county meetings, petitions, and committees of correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
announced the public diſcontent; and inſtead of voting with
a triumphant majority, the friends of government were often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to a ſtruggle, and ſometimes to a defeat. The Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
adopted Mr. Dunning's motion, <q>That the influence of the
Crown had increaſed, was increaſing, and ought to be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed:</q>
and Mr. Burke's bill of reform was framed with ſkill,
introduced with eloquence, and ſupported by numbers. Our late
preſident, the American Secretary of State, very narrowly eſcaped
the ſentence of proſcription; but the unfortunate Board of Trade
was aboliſhed in the committee by a ſmall majority (207 to 199)
of eight votes. The ſtorm, however, blew over for a time; a large
defection of country gentlemen eluded the ſanguine hopes of the
patriots: the Lords of Trade were revived; adminiſtration reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their ſtrength and ſpirit; and the flames of London, which
were kindled by a miſchievous madman, admoniſhed all thinking
men of the danger of an appeal to the people. In the premature
diſſolution which followed this ſeſſion of parliament I loſt my ſeat.
Mr. Elliot was now deeply engaged in the meaſures of oppoſition,
and the electors of Leſkeard<note n="*" place="bottom">The borough which Mr. Gibbon had repreſented in parliament.</note> are commonly of the ſame opinion
as Mr. Elliot.</p>

In this interval of my ſenatorial life, I publiſhed the ſecond and
third volumes of the Decline and Fall. My eccleſiaſtical hiſtory ſtill
breathed the ſame ſpirit of freedom; but proteſtant zeal is more
indifferent to the characters and controverſies of the fourth and fifth
centuries. My obſtinate ſilence had damped the ardour of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemics.
Dr. Watſon, the moſt candid of my adverſaries, aſſured me
that he had no thoughts of renewing the attack, and my impartial
balance of the virtues and vices of Julian was generally praiſed.
This truce was interrupted only by ſome animadverſions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics
of Italy, and by ſome angry letters from Mr. Travis, who
made me perſonally reſponſible for condemning, with the beſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,
the ſpurious text of the three heavenly witneſſes.</p>
            <p>The piety or prudence of my Italian tranſlator has provided an
antidote againſt the poiſon of his original. The 5th and 7th vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
are armed with five letters from an anonymous divine to his
friends, Foothead and Kirk, two Engliſh ſtudents at Rome; and this
meritorious ſervice is commended by Monſignor Stonor, a prelate of
the ſame nation, who diſcovers much venom in the <hi>fluid</hi> and nervous
ſtyle of Gibbon. The critical eſſay at the end of the third volume
was furniſhed by the Abbate Nicola Spedalieri, whoſe zeal has gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
ſwelled to a more ſolid confutation in two quarto volumes.—
Shall I be excuſed for not having read them?</p>
            <p>The brutal inſolence of Mr. Travis's challenge can only be excuſed
by the abſence of learning, judgment, and humanity; and to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
he has the faireſt or fouleſt pretenſion. Compared with Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
Travis, Chelſum and Davies aſſume the title of reſpectable
enemies.</p>
            <p>The bigotted advocate of popes and monks may be turned over
even to the bigots of Oxford; and the wretched Travis ſtill ſmarts
under the laſh of the mercileſs Porſon. I conſider Mr. Porſon's
anſwer to Archdeacon Travis as the moſt acute and accurate piece of
criticiſm which has appeared ſince the days of Bentley. His ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0112200701:185"/>
are founded in argument, enriched with learning, and enlivened
with wit; and his adverſary neither deſerves nor finds any quarter at
his hands. The evidence of the three heavenly witneſſes would now
be rejected in any court of juſtice: but prejudice is blind, authority
is deaf, and our vulgar bibles will ever be polluted by this ſpurious
text, <q>ſedet aeternumque ſedebit.</q> The more learned eccleſiaſtics will
indeed have the ſecret ſatisfaction of reprobating in the cloſet what
they read in the church.</p>
            <p>I perceived, and without ſurpriſe, the coldneſs and even prejudice
of the town; nor could a whiſper eſcape my ear, that, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of many readers, my continuation was much inferior to the
original attempts. An author who cannot aſcend will always appear
to ſink: envy was now prepared for my reception, and the zeal of
my religious, was fortified by the motive of my political, enemies.
Biſhop Newton, in writing his own life, was at full liberty to declare
how much he himſelf and two eminent brethren were diſguſted by

                     <hi>Extract from</hi> Mr. GIBBON's <hi>Common Place Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thomas Newton, Biſhop of Briſtol and Dean of St. Paul's, was born at Litchfield on the 21ſt of December 1703, O. S. (1 ſt January 1704, N. S.), and died the 14th of February 1782, in the 79th year of his age. A few days before his death he finiſhed the memoirs of his own life, which have been prefixed to an edition of his poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous works, firſt publiſhed in quarto, and ſince (1787) re-publiſhed in ſix volume octavo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 173, 174. Some books were publiſhed in 1781, which employed ſome of the Biſhop's leiſure hours, and during his illneſs. Mr. Gibbon's <hi>Hiſtory of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Émpire</hi> he read throughout, but it by no means anſwered his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he found it rather a prolix and tedious performance, his matter unintereſting, and his ſtyle affected; his teſtimonies not to be depended upon, and his frequent ſcoffs at religion offenſive to every ſober mind. He had before been convicted of making falſe quotations, which ſhould have taught him more prudence and caution. But, without examining his authorities, there is one which muſt neceſſarily ſtrike every man who has read Dr. Burnet's Treatiſe <hi>de Statú Mortuorum.</hi> In vol. iii. p. 99. Mr. G. has the following note:—<q>Burnet (<hi>de S. M.</hi> p. 56—84.) collects the opinions of the Fathers, as far as they aſſert the ſleep or repoſe of human ſouls till the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He afterwards expoſes (p. 91.) the inconveniences which muſt ariſe if they poſſeſſed a more active and ſenſible exiſtence. Who would not from hence infer that Dr. B. was an advocate for the ſleep or inſenſible exiſtence of the ſoul after death? whereas his doctrine is directly the contrary. He has employed ſome chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in treating of the ſtate of human ſouls in the interval between death and the reſurrection; and after various proofs from reaſon, from ſcripture, and the Fathers, his concluſions are, that human ſouls exiſt after their ſeparation from the body, that they are in a good or evil ſtate according to their good or ill behaviour, but that neither their happineſs nor their miſery will be complete or perfect before the day of judgment. His argumentation is thus ſummed up at the end of the 4th chapter—<hi>Ex quibus conſtat primo, animas ſupereſſe extincto corpore; ſecundo, bonas bene, malas male ſe habituras; tertio, nec illis ſummam felicitatem, nec his ſummam miſeriam, acceſſuram eſſe ante diem judicii.</hi>
                     </q> (The Biſhop's reading the whole was a greater compliment to the work than was paid to it by two of the moſt eminent of his brethren for their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtation. The one entered upon it, but was ſoon wearied, and laid it aſide in diſguſt: the other returned it upon the bookſeller's hands; and it is ſaid that Mr. G. himſelf happened unluckily to be in the ſhop at the ſame time.)</p>
                  <p>Does the Biſhop comply with his own precept in the next page? (p. 175.) <q>Old age ſhould lenify, ſhould ſoften men's manners, and make them more mild and gentle; but often has the contrary effect, hardens their hearts, and makes them more ſour and crabbed.</q> —He is ſpeaking of Dr. Johnſon.</p>
                  <p>Have I ever infinuated that preferment-hunting is the great occupation of an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical life? (Memoirs paſſim); that a miniſter's influence and a biſhop's patronage are ſometimes pledged eleven deep? (p. 151.) that a prebendary conſiders the audit week as the better part of the year? (p. 127.) or that the moſt eminent of prieſts, the pope himſelf, would change their religion, if any thing better could be offered them? (p. 56.) Such things are more than inſinuated in the Biſhop's Life, which afforded ſome ſcandal to the church, and ſome diverſion to the profane laity.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0112200701:186"/>
Burnet's meaning by the alternative of ſleep or repoſe. That philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic
divine ſuppoſes, that, in the period between death and the
reſurrection, human ſouls exiſt without a body, endowed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
conſciouſneſs, but deſtitute of all active or paſſive connection
with the external world. <q>Secundum communem dictionem ſacrae

            <p>I was however encouraged by ſome domeſtic and foreign teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of applauſe; and the ſecond and third volumes inſenſibly roſe in
ſale and reputation to a level with the firſt. But the public is ſeldom
wrong; and I am inclined to believe that, eſpecially in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they are more prolix and leſs entertaining than the firſt: my
efforts had not been relaxed by ſucceſs, and I had rather deviated
into the oppoſite fault of minute and ſuperfluous diligence. On the
Continent, my name and writings were ſlowly diffuſed: a French
tranſlation of the firſt volume had diſappointed the bookſellers of
Paris; and a paſſage in the third was conſtrued as a perſonal reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the reigning monarch<note n="*" place="bottom">It may not be generally known that Louis the Sixteenth is a great reader, and a reader of Engliſh books. On peruſing a paſſage of my Hiſtory which ſeems to compare him to Arcadius or Honorius, he expreſſed his reſentment to the Prince of B *****, from whom the intelligence was conveyed to me. I ſhall neither diſclaim the alluſion, nor examine the likeneſs; but the ſituation of the late King of France excludes all ſuſpicion of flattery; and I am ready to declare that the concluding obſervations of my third volume were written before his acceſſion to the throne.</note>.</p>
            <p>Before I could apply for a ſeat at the general election the liſt was
already full; but Lord North's promiſe was ſincere, his recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
was effectual, and I was ſoon choſen on a vacancy for the
borough of Lymington, in Hampſhire. In the firſt ſeſſion of the
new parliament, adminiſtration ſtood their ground; their final over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
was reſerved for the ſecond. The American war had once
been the favourite of the country: the pride of England was irritated
by the reſiſtance of her colonies, and the executive power was driven
by national clamour into the moſt vigorous and coercive meaſures.
But the length of a fruitleſs conteſt, the loſs of armies, the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of debt and taxes, and the hoſtile confederacy of France, Spain,
and Holland, indiſpoſed the public to the American war, and the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0112200701:188"/>
perſons by whom it was conducted; the repreſentatives of the people,
followed, at a ſlow diſtance, the changes of their opinion; and the
miniſters who refuſed to bend, were broken by the tempeſt. As
ſoon as Lord North had loſt, or was about to loſe, a majority in the
Houſe of Commons, he ſurrendered his office, and retired to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
ſtation, with the tranquil aſſurance of a clear conſcience and a
cheerful temper: the old fabric was diſſolved, and the poſts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
were occupied by the victorious and veteran troops of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
The lords of trade were not immediately diſmiſſed, but
the board itſelf was aboliſhed by Mr. Burke's bill, which decency
had compelled the patriots to revive; and I was ſtripped of a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
ſalary, after having enjoyed it about three years.</p>
            <p>So flexible is the title of my Hiſtory, that the final aera might be
fixed at my own choice; and I long heſitated whether I ſhould be
content with the three volumes, the fall of the Weſtern empire,
which fulfilled my firſt engagement with the public. In this interval
of ſuſpence, nearly a twelvemonth, I returned by a natural impulſe
to the Greek authors of antiquity; I read with new pleaſure the
Iliad and the Odyſſey, the Hiſtories of Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Xenophon, a large portion of the tragic and comic theatre of
Athens, and many intereſting dialogues of the Socratic ſchool. Yet
in the luxury of freedom I began to wiſh for the daily taſk, the
active purſuit, which gave a value to every book, and an object to
every inquiry: the preface of a new edition announced my deſign,
and I dropped without reluctance from the age of Plato to that of
Juſtinian. The original texts of Procopius and Agathias ſupplied the
events and even the characters of his reign: but a laborious winter
was devoted to the Codes, the Pandects, and the modern interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
before I preſumed to form an abſtract of the civil law. My
ſkill was improved by practice, my diligence perhaps was quickened
by the loſs of office; and, excepting the laſt chapter, I had finiſhed the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0112200701:189"/>
fourth volume before I ſought a retreat on the banks of the Leman
Lake.</p>
            <p>It is not the purpoſe of this narrative to expatiate on the public or
ſecret hiſtory of the times: the ſchiſm which followed the death of
the Marquis of Rockingham, the appointment of the Earl of Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,
the reſignation of Mr. Fox, and his famous coalition with
Lord North. But I may aſſert, with ſome degree of aſſurance, that
in their political conflict thoſe great antagoniſts had never felt any
perſonal animoſity to each other, that their reconciliation was eaſy
and ſincere, and that their friendſhip has never been clouded by the
ſhadow of ſuſpicion or jealouſy. The moſt violent or venal of their
reſpective followers embraced this fair occaſion of revolt, but their
alliance ſtill commanded a majority in the Houſe of Commons; the
peace was cenſured, Lord Shelburne reſigned, and the two friends
knelt on the ſame cuſhion to take the oath of ſecretary of ſtate.
From a principle of gratitude I adhered to the coalition: my vote
was counted in the day of battle, but I was overlooked in the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ſpoil. There were many claimants more deſerving and
importunate than myſelf: the board of trade could not be reſtored;
and, while the liſt of places was curtailed, the number of candidates
was doubled. An eaſy diſmiſſion to a ſecure ſeat at the board of
cuſtoms or exciſe was promiſed on the firſt vacancy: but the chance
was diſtant and doubtful; nor could I ſolicit with much ardour an
ignoble ſervitude, which would have robbed me of the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of my ſtudious hours: at the ſame time the tumult of London,
and the attendance on parliament, were grown more irkſome; and,
without ſome additional income, I could not long or prudently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the ſtile of expence to which I was accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>From my early acquaintance with Lauſanne I had always cheriſhed
a ſecret wiſh, that the ſchool of my youth might become the retreat
of my declining age. A moderate fortune would ſecure the bleſſings
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0112200701:190"/>
of eaſe, leiſure, and independence: the country, the people, the
manners, the language, were congenial to my taſte; and I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
the hope of paſſing ſome years in the domeſtic ſociety of a
friend. After travelling with ſeveral Engliſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Richard Worſley, Lord Cheſterfield, Broderick Lord Midleton, and Mr. Hume, brother to Sir Abraham.</note> Mr. Deyverdun was
now ſettled at home, in a pleaſant habitation, the gift of his deceaſed
aunt: we had long been ſeparated, we had long been ſilent; yet in
my firſt letter I expoſed, with the moſt perfect confidence, my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
my ſentiments, and my deſigns. His immediate anſwer was
a warm and joyful acceptance: the picture of our future life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
my impatience; and the terms of arrangement were ſhort
and ſimple, as he poſſeſſed the property, and I undertook the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of our common houſe<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix, Letters, No. CXXV. CXXVI. CXXVII. CXXVIII. CXXIX. CXXX.</note> Before I could break my Engliſh
chain, it was incumbent on me to ſtruggle with the feelings of my
heart, the indolence of my temper, and the opinion of the world,
which unanimouſly condemned this voluntary baniſhment. In the
diſpoſal of my effects, the library, a ſacred depoſit, was alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
as my poſt-chaiſe moved over Weſtminſter-bridge I bid a
long farewel to the <q>fumum et opes ſtrepitum<expan>

by the direct road through France was not attended with any
accident, and I arrived at Lauſanne nearly twenty years after my
ſecond departure. Within leſs than three months the coalition ſtruck
on ſome hidden rocks: had I remained on board, I ſhould have
periſhed in the general ſhipwreck<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Appendix, Letter, No. CL.</note>.</p>
            <p>Since my eſtabliſhment at Lauſanne, more than ſeven years have
elapſed; and if every day has not been equally ſoft and ſerene, not
a day, not a moment, has occurred in which I have repented of my
choice. During my abſence, a long portion of human life, many
changes had happened: my elder acquaintance had left the ſtage;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0112200701:191"/>
virgins were ripened into matrons, and children were grown to the
age of manhood. But the ſame manners were tranſmitted from one
generation to another: my friend alone was an ineſtimable treaſure;
my name was not totally forgotten, and all were ambitious to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the arrival of a ſtranger and the return of a fellow-citizen. The
firſt winter was given to a general embrace, without any nice diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of perſons and characters. After a more regular ſettlement,
a more accurate ſurvey, I diſcovered three ſolid and permanent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of my new ſituation. 1. My perſonal freedom had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
impaired by the Houſe of Commons and the Board of Trade;
but I was now delivered from the chain of duty and dependence,
from the hopes and fears of political adventure: my ſober mind was
no longer intoxicated by the fumes of party, and I rejoiced in my
eſcape, as often as I read of the midnight debates which preceded the
diſſolution of parliament<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, Letter, No. CXLVI.</note>. 2. My Engliſh oeconomy had been that
of a ſolitary bachelor, who might afford ſome occaſional dinners. In
Switzerland I enjoyed at every meal, at every hour, the free and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
converſation of the friend of my youth; and my daily table was
always provided for the reception of one or two extraordinary
gueſts. Our importance in ſociety is leſs a poſitive than a relative
weight: in London I was loſt in the crowd; I ranked with the firſt
families of Lauſanne, and my ſtyle of prudent expence enabled me
to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities. 3. Inſtead of a
ſmall houſe between a ſtreet and a ſtable-yard, I began to occupy a
ſpacious and convenient manſion, connected on the north ſide with
the city, and open on the ſouth to a beautiful and boundleſs horizon.
A garden of four acres had been laid out by the taſte of Mr. Deyver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun:
from the garden a rich ſcenery of meadows and vineyards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
to the Leman Lake, and the proſpect far beyond the Lake is
crowned by the ſtupendous mountains of Savoy. My books and my
acquaintance had been firſt united in London; but this happy poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0112200701:192"/>
of my library in town and country was finally reſerved for
Lauſanne. Poſſeſſed of every comfort in this triple alliance, I could
not be tempted to change my habitation with the changes of the
ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>My friends had been kindly apprehenſive that I ſhould not be able
to exiſt in a Swiſs town at the foot of the Alps, after having ſo long
converſed with the firſt men of the firſt cities of the world. Such lofty
connections may attract the curious, and gratify the vain; but I am
too modeſt, or too proud, to rate my own value by that of my aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates;
and whatſoever may be the fame of learning or genius, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has ſhewn me that the cheaper qualifications of politeneſs
and good ſenſe are of more uſeful currency in the commerce of life.
By many, converſation is eſteemed as a theatre or a ſchool: but,
after the morning has been occupied by the labours of the library, I
wiſh to unbend rather than to exerciſe my mind; and in the interval
between tea and ſupper I am far from diſdaining the innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a game at cards. Lauſanne is peopled by a numerous
gentry, whoſe companionable idleneſs is ſeldom diſturbed by the
purſuits of avarice or ambition: the women, though conſined to a
domeſtic education, are endowed for the moſt part with more taſte
and knowledge than their huſbands and brothers: but the decent
freedom of both ſexes is equally remote from the extremes of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and refinement. I ſhall add as a misfortune rather than a
merit, that the ſituation and beauty of the Pays de Vaud, the long
habits of the Engliſh, the medical reputation of Dr. Tiſſot, and the
faſhion of viewing the mountains and <hi>Glaciers,</hi> have opened us on
all ſides to the incurſions of foreigners. The viſits of Mr. and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Necker, of Prince Henry of Pruſſia, and of Mr. Fox, may from
ſome pleaſing exceptions; but, in general, Lauſanne has appeared
moſt agreeable in my eyes, when we have been abandoned to our
own ſociety. I had frequently ſeen Mr. Necker, in the ſummer of
1784, at a country houſe near Lauſanne, where he compoſed his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0112200701:193"/>
Treatiſe on the Adminiſtration of the Finances. I have ſince, in
October 1790, viſited him in his preſent reſidence, the caſtle and
barony of Copet, near Geneva. Of the merits and meaſures of that
ſtateſman various opinions may be entertained; but all impartial men
muſt agree in their eſteem of his integrity and patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>In the month of Auguſt 1784, Prince Henry of Pruſſia, in his way
to Paris, paſſed three days at Lauſanne. His military conduct has
been praiſed by profeſſional men; his character has been vilified by
the wit and malice of a daemon<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoire Secret de la Cour de Berlin.</note>; but I was flattered by his affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and entertained by his converſation.</p>
            <p>In his tour of Switzerland (September 1788) Mr. Fox gave me
two days of free and private ſociety<note n="†" place="bottom">See Letter in the Continuation, October 1, 1788.</note>. He ſeemed to feel, and even
to envy, the happineſs of my ſituation; while I admired the powers
of a ſuperior man, as they are blended in his attractive character
with the ſoftneſs and ſimplicity of a child. Perhaps no human being
was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or falſehood.</p>
            <p>My tranſmigration from London to Lauſanne could not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
without interrupting the courſe of my hiſtorical labours. The
hurry of my departure, the joy of my arrival, the delay of my tools,
ſuſpended their progreſs; and a full twelvemonth was loſt before I
could reſume the thread of regular and daily induſtry. A number
of books moſt requiſite and leaſt common had been previouſly
ſelected; the academical library of Lauſanne, which I could uſe as
my own, contained at leaſt the fathers and councils; and I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
ſome occaſional ſuccour from the public collections of Berne
and Geneva. The fourth volume was ſoon terminated, by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
of the controverſies of the Incarnation, which the learned
Dr. Prideaux was apprehenſive of expoſing to profane eyes. It had
been the original deſign of the learned Dean Prideaux to write the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0112200701:194"/>
hiſtory of the ruin of the Eaſtern Church. In this work it would
have been neceſſary, not only to unravel all thoſe controverſies
which the Chriſtians made about the hypoſtatical union, but alſo to
unfold all the niceties and ſubtle notions which each ſect entertained
concerning it. The pious hiſtorian was apprehenſive of expoſing
that incomprehenſible myſtery to the cavils and objections of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
and he durſt not, <q>ſeeing the nature of this book, venture
it abroad in ſo wanton and lewd an age<note n="*" place="bottom">See preface to the Life of Mahomet, p. 10, 11.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the fifth and ſixth volumes the revolutions of the empire and
the world are moſt rapid, various, and inſtructive; and the Greek
or Roman hiſtorians are checked by the hoſtile narratives of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
of the Eaſt and the Weſt<note n="†" place="bottom">I have followed the judicious precept of the Abbé de Mably, (Manière d'ecrire l'Hiſtoire, p. 110.) who adviſes the hiſtorian not to dwell too minutely on the decay of the eaſtern empire; but to conſider the barbarian conquerors as a more worthy ſubject of his narrative. <q>Fas eſt et ab hoſte doceri.</q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>It was not till after many deſigns, and many trials, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
as I ſtill prefer, the method of grouping my picture by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and the ſeeming neglect of chronological order is ſurely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated
by the ſuperior merits of intereſt and perſpicuity. The
ſtyle of the firſt volume is, in my opinion, ſomewhat crude and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate;
in the ſecond and third it is ripened into eaſe, correctneſs,
and numbers; but in the three laſt I may have been ſeduced by
the facility of my pen, and the conſtant habit of ſpeaking one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and writing another may have infuſed ſome mixture of Gallic
idioms. Happily for my eyes, I have always cloſed my ſtudies with
the day, and commonly with the morning; and a long, but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
labour has been accompliſhed, without fatiguing either the
mind or body; but when I computed the remainder of my time and
my taſk, it was apparent that, according to the ſeaſon of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the delay of a month would be productive of that of a year.
I was now ſtraining for the goal, and in the laſt winter many even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0112200701:195"/>
were borrowed from the ſocial pleaſures of Lauſanne. I could
now wiſh that a pauſe, an interval, had been allowed for a ſerious
reviſal.</p>
            <p>I have preſumed to mark the moment of conception: I ſhall now
commemorate the hour of my final deliverance. It was on the day,
or rather night, of the 27th of June 1787, between the hours of
eleven and twelve, that I wrote the laſt lines of the laſt page, in a
ſummer-houſe in my garden. After laying down my pen, I took
ſeveral turns in a <hi>berceau,</hi> or covered walk of acacias, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
a proſpect of the country, the lake, and the mountains. The
air was temperate, the ſky was ſerene, the ſilver orb of the moon
was reflected from the waters, and all nature was ſilent. I will not
diſſemble the firſt emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom,
and, perhaps, the eſtabliſhment of my fame. But my pride was
ſoon humbled, and a ſober melancholy was ſpread over my mind, by
the idea that I had taken an everlaſting leave of an old and agreeable
companion, and that whatſoever might be the future date of my
Hiſtory, the life of the hiſtorian muſt be ſhort and precarious. I
will add two facts, which have ſeldom occurred in the compoſition
of ſix, or at leaſt of five, quartos. 1. My firſt rough manuſcript,
without any intermediate copy, has been ſent to the preſs. 2. Not a
ſheet has been ſeen by any human eyes, excepting thoſe of the author
and the printer: the faults and the merits are excluſively my own<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>I cannot help recollecting a much more extraordinary fact, which
is affirmed of himſelf by Retif de la Bretorme, a voluminous and
original writer of French novels. He laboured, and may ſtill labour,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0112200701:196"/>
in the humble office of corrector to a printing-houſe; but this office
enabled him to tranſport an entire volume from his mind to the
preſs; and his work was given to the public without ever having
been written with a pen.</p>
            <p>After a quiet reſidence of four years, during which I had never
moved ten miles from Lauſanne, it was not without ſome reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and terror that I undertook, in a journey of two hundred
leagues, to croſs the mountains and the ſea. Yet this formidable
adventure was atchieved without danger or fatigue; and at the end
of a fortnight I found myſelf in Lord Sheffield's houſe and library,
ſafe, happy, and at home. The character of my friend (Mr. Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royd)
had recommended him to a ſeat in parliament for Coventry,
the command of a regiment of light dragoons, and an Iriſh peerage.
The ſenſe and ſpirit of his political writings have decided the public
opinion on the great queſtions of our commercial intereſt with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
and Ireland<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations on the Commerce of the American States, by John Lord Sheſſield, the 6th edition, London, 1784, in octavo.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ſale of his Obſervations on the American States was diffuſive,
their effect beneficial; the Navigation Act, the palladium of Britain,
was defended, and perhaps ſaved, by his pen; and he proves, by
the weight of fact and argument, that the mother-country may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
and flouriſh after the loſs of America. My friend has never
cultivated the arts of compoſition; but his materials are copious and
correct, and he leaves on his paper the clear impreſſion of an active
and vigorous mind. His "Obſervations on the Trade, Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and preſent State of Ireland," were intended to guide the
induſtry, to correct the prejudices, and to aſſuage the paſſions of a
country which ſeemed to forget that ſhe could be free and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
only by a friendly connection with Great Britain. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
obſervations are written with ſo much eaſe and ſpirit, that
they may be read by thoſe who are the leaſt intereſted in the ſubject.</p>

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0112200701:197"/>
He fell (in 1784) with the unpopular coalition; but his merit has
been acknowledged at the laſt general election, 1790, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
invitation and free choice of the city of Briſtol. During
the whole time of my reſidence in England I was entertained at
Sheffield-Place and in Downing-Street by his hoſpitable kindneſs;
and the moſt pleaſant period was that which I paſſed in the domeſtic
ſociety of the family. In the larger circle of the metropolis I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the country and the inhabitants with the knowledge, and
without the prejudices, of an Engliſhman; but I rejoiced in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
increaſe of wealth and proſperity, which might be fairly
divided between the ſpirit of the nation and the wiſdom of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
All party-reſentment was now loſt in oblivion: ſince I was
no man's rival, no man was my enemy. I felt the dignity of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence,
and as I aſked no more, I was ſatisfied with the general
civilities of the world. The houſe in London which I frequented
with moſt pleaſure and aſſiduity was that of Lord North. After
the loſs of power and of ſight, he was ſtill happy in himſelf and
his friends; and my public tribute of gratitude and eſteem could no
longer be ſuſpected of any intreſted motive. Before my departure
from England, I was preſent at the auguſt ſpectacle of Mr. Haſtings's
trial in Weſtminſter Hall. It is not my province to abſolve or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Governor of India; but Mr. Sheridan's eloquence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
my applauſe; nor could I hear without emotion the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
compliment which he paid me in the preſence of the Britiſh
nation<note n="*" place="bottom">He ſaid the facts that made up the volume of narrative were unparalleled in atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, and that nothing equal in criminality was to be traced, either in ancient or modern hiſtory, in the correct periods of Tacitus or the luminous page of Gibbon. <hi>Morning Chronicle, June</hi> 14, 1788.</note>.</p>
            <p>From this diſplay of genius, which blazed four ſucceſſive days,
I ſhall ſtoop to a very mechanical circumſtance. As I was waiting
in the managers' box, I had the curioſity to inquire of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0112200701:198"/>
writer, how many words a ready and rapid orator might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
in an hour? From 7000 to 7500 was his anſwer. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
of 7200 will afford 120 words in a minute, and two words in
each ſecond. But this computation will only apply to the Engliſh
language.</p>
            <p>As the publication of my three laſt volumes was the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
ſo it was the firſt care of my Engliſh journey. The previous
arrangements with the bookſeller and the printer were ſettled in my
paſſage through London, and the proofs, which I returned more
correct, were tranſmitted every poſt from the preſs to Sheffield-Place.
The length of the operation, and the leiſure of the country, allowed
ſome time to review my manuſcript. Several rare and uſeful books,
the Aſſiſes de Jeruſalem, Ramuſius de Bello C. P<hi rend="sup">aro</hi>, the Greek Acts of
the Synod of Florence, the Statuta Urbis Romae, &amp;c. were procured,
and introduced in their proper places the ſupplements which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.
The impreſſion of the fourth volume had conſumed three
months. Our common intereſt required that we ſhould move with
a quicker pace; and Mr. Strahan fulfilled his engagement, which
few printers could ſuſtain, of delivering every week three thouſand
copies of nine ſheets. The day of publication was, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
that it might coincide with the fifty-firſt anniverſary of my
own birth-day; the double feſtival was celebrated by a cheerful
literary dinner at Mr. Cadell's houſe; and I ſeemed to bluſh while
they read an elegant compliment from Mr. Hayley<note n="*" place="bottom">

the invitation of the Engliſh Sparrow, who chirped in the
groves of Eartham, near Chicheſter. As moſt of the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers
were naturally deſirous of completing their ſets, the ſale of
the quarto edition was quick and eaſy; and an octavo ſize was
printed, to ſatisfy at a cheaper rate the public demand. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of my work was generally read, and variouſly judged. The
ſtyle has been expoſed to much academical criticiſm; a religious cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
was revived, and the reproach of indecency has been loudly
echoed by the rigid cenſors of morals. I never could underſtand
the clamour that has been raiſed againſt the indecency of my three
laſt volumes. 1. An equal degree of freedom in the former part,
eſpecially in the firſt volume, had paſſed without reproach. 2. I am
juſtified in painting the manners of the times; the vices of Theodora
form an eſſential feature in the reign and character of Juſtinian.
3. My Engliſh text is chaſte, and all licentious paſſages are left in
the obſcurity of a learned language. <hi>Le Latin dans ſes mots brave
l'honnêteté,</hi> ſays the correct Boileau, in a country and idiom more
ſcrupulous than our own. Yet, upon the whole, the Hiſtory of
the Decline and Fall ſeems to have ſtruck root, both at home and
abroad, and may, perhaps, a hundred years hence ſtill continue to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0112200701:202"/>
be abuſed. I am leſs flattered by Mr. Porſon's high encomium on
the ſtyle and ſpirit of my hiſtory, than I am ſatisfied with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
teſtimony to my attention, diligence, and accuracy; thoſe
humble virtues, which religious zeal had moſt audaciouſly denied.

            <p>The French, Italian, and German tranſlations have been executed
with various ſucceſs; but, inſtead of patronizing, I ſhould willingly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0112200701:203"/>
ſuppreſs ſuch imperfect copies, which injure the character, while
they propagate the name of the author. The firſt volume had been
feebly, though faithfully, tranſlated into French by M. Le Clerc de
Septchenes, a young gentleman of a ſtudious character and liberal
fortune. After his deceaſe the work was continued by two manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers
of Paris, M. M. Deſmuniers and Cantwell: but the former
is now an active member in the national aſſembly, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
languiſhes in the hands of his aſſociate. The ſuperior
merit of the interpreter, or his language, inclines me to prefer the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
verſion: but I wiſh that it were in my power to read the German,
which is praiſed by the beſt judges. The Iriſh pirates are at once
my friends and my enemies. But I cannot be diſpleaſed with the
two numerous and correct impreſſions which have been publiſhed
for the uſe of the continent at Baſil in Switzerland<note n="*" place="bottom">Of their fourteen octavo volumes the two laſt include the whole body of the notes. The public importunity had forced <hi>me</hi> to remove them from the end of the volume to the bottom of the page; but I have often repented of my compliance.</note>. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
of our language and literature are not confined to Europe
alone, and a writer who ſucceeds in London, is ſpeedily read on the
banks of the Delaware and the Ganges.</p>
            <p>In the preface of the fourth volume, while I gloried in the name
of an Engliſhman, I announced my approaching return to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of the Lake of Lauſanne. This laſt trial confirmed my
aſſurance that I had wiſely choſen for my own happineſs; nor did
I once, in a year's viſit, entertain a wiſh of ſettling in my native
country. Britain is the free and fortunate iſland; but where is the
ſpot in which I could unite the comforts and beauties of my eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
at Lauſanne? The tumult of London aſtoniſhed my eyes
and ears; the amuſements of public places were no longer adequate
to the trouble; the clubs and aſſemblies were filled with new faces and
young men; and our beſt ſociety, our long and late dinners, would
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0112200701:204"/>
ſoon have been prejudicial to my health. Without any ſhare in the
political wheel, I muſt be idle and inſignificant: yet the moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
temptations would not have enticed me to engage a ſecond time
in the ſervitude of parliament or office. At Tunbridge, ſome weeks
after the publication of my Hiſtory, I reluctantly quitted Lord and
Lady Sheffield, and, with a young Swiſs friend<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Wilhelm. de Severy.</note>, whom I had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the Engliſh world, I purſued the road of Dover and Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne.
My habitation was embelliſhed in my abſence, and the laſt
diviſion of books, which followed my ſteps, increaſed my choſen
library to the number of between ſix and ſeven thouſand volumes.
My ſeraglio was ample, my choice was free, my appetite was keen.
After a full repaſt on Homer and Ariſtophanes, I involved myſelf
in the philoſophic maze of the writings of Plato, of which the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
is, perhaps, more intereſting than the argumentative part:
but I ſtepped aſide into every path of inquiry which reading or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
accidentally opened.</p>
            <p>Alas! the joy of my return, and my ſtudious ardour, were ſoon
damped by the melancholy ſtate of my friend Mr. Deyverdun. His
health and ſpirits had long ſuffered a gradual decline, a ſucceſſion of
apoplectic fits anounced his diſſolution; and before he expired, thoſe
who loved him could not wiſh for the continuance of his life. The
voice of reaſon might congratulate his deliverance, but the feelings
of nature and friendſhip could be ſubdued only by time: his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
character was ſtill alive in my remembrance; each room, each
walk, was imprinted with our common footſteps; and I ſhould bluſh
at my own philoſophy, if a long interval of ſtudy had not preceded
and followed the death of my friend. By his laſt will he left to me
the option of purchaſing his houſe and garden, or of poſſeſſing them
during my life, on the payment either of a ſtipulated price, or of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0112200701:205"/>
an eaſy retribution to his kinſman and heir. I ſhould probably have
been tempted by the daemon of property, if ſome legal difficulties
had not been ſtarted againſt my title: a conteſt would have been
vexatious, doubtful, and invidious; and the heir moſt gratefully
ſubſcribed an agreement, which rendered my life-poſſeſſion more
perfect, and his future condition more advantageous. Yet I had
often revolved the judicious lines in which Pope anſwers the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his long-ſighted friend:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Pity to build without or child or wife;</l>
               <l>Why, you'll enjoy it only all your life:</l>
               <l>Well, if the uſe be mine, does it concern one,</l>
               <l>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The certainty of my tenure has allowed me to lay out a conſiderable
ſum in improvements and alterations: they have been executed with
ſkill and taſte; and few men of letters, perhaps, in Europe, are ſo deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
lodged as myſelf. But I feel, and with the decline of years I ſhall
more painfully feel, that I am alone in paradiſe. Among the circle
of my acquaintance at Lauſanne, I have gradually acquired the ſolid
and tender friendſhip of a reſpectable family<note n="*" place="bottom">The family of de Severy.</note>: the four perſons of
whom it is compoſed are all endowed with the virtues beſt adapted
to their age and ſituation; and I am encouraged to love the parents
as a brother, and the children as a father. Every day we ſeek and
find the opportunities of meeting: yet even this valuable connection
cannot ſupply the loſs of domeſtic ſociety.</p>
            <p>Within the laſt two or three years our tranquillity has been clouded
by the diſorders of France: many families at Lauſanne were alarmed
and affected by the terrors of an impending bankruptcy; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
or rather the diſſolution of the kingdom has been heard and
felt in the adjacent lands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0112200701:206"/>
I beg leave to ſubſcribe my aſſent to Mr. Burke's creed on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of France. I admire his eloquence, I approve his politics,
I adore his chivalry, and I can almoſt excuſe his reverence for church
eſtabliſhments. I have ſometimes thought of writing a dialogue of
the dead, in which Lucian, Eraſmus, and Voltaire ſhould mutually
acknowledge the danger of expoſing an old ſuperſtition to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the blind and fanatic multitude.</p>
            <p>A ſwarm of emigrants of both ſexes, who eſcaped from the public
ruin, has been attracted by the vicinity, the manners, and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Lauſanne; and our narrow habitations in town and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
are now occupied by the firſt names and titles of the departed
monarchy. Theſe noble fugitives are entitled to our pity; they may
claim our eſteem, but they cannot, in their preſent ſtate of mind and
fortune, much contribute to our amuſement. Inſtead of looking
down as calm and idle ſpectators on the theatre of Europe, our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
harmony is ſomewhat embittered by the infuſion of party
ſpirit: our ladies and gentlemen aſſume the character of ſelf-taught
politicians; and the ſober dictates of wiſdom and experience are
ſilenced by the clamour of the triumphant <hi>democrates.</hi> The fanatic
miſſionaries of ſedition have ſcattered the ſeeds of diſcontent in our
cities and villages, which had flouriſhed above two hundred and fifty
years without fearing the approach of war, or feeling the weight of
government. Many individuals, and ſome communities, appear to
be infeſted with the Gallic phrenzy, the wild theories of equal and
boundleſs freedom; but I truſt that the body of the people will be
faithful to their ſovereign and to themſelves; and I am ſatisfied that
the failure or ſucceſs of a revolt would equally terminate in the ruin
of the country. While the ariſtocracy of Bern protects the happineſs,
it is ſuperfluous to enquire whether it be founded in the rights, of
man: the oeconomy of the ſtate is liberally ſupplied without the aid
of taxes; and the magiſtrates <hi>muſt</hi> reign with prudence and equity,
ſince they are unarmed in the midſt of an armed nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0112200701:207"/>
The revenue of Bern, excepting ſome ſmall duties, is derived from
church lands, tithes, feudal rights, and intereſt of money. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
has nearly 500,000l. ſterling in the. Engliſh funds, and the
amount of their treaſure is unknown to the citizens themſelves. For
myſelf (may the omen be averted) I can only declare, that the firſt
ſtroke of a rebel drum would be the ſignal of my immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>When I contemplate the common lot of mortality, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that I have drawn a high prize in the lottery of life. The far
greater part of the globe is overſpread with barbariſm or ſlavery: in
the civilized world, the moſt numerous claſs is condemned to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and poverty; and the double fortune of my birth in a free and
enlightened country, in an honourable and wealthy family, is the
lucky chance of an unit againſt millions. The general probability is
about three to one, that a new-born infant will not live to complete
his fiftieth year<note n="*" place="bottom">See Buffon, Supplement à l'Hiſtoire naturelle, tom. vii. page 158—164. of a given number of new-born infants, one half, by the fault of nature or man, is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed before the age of puberty and reaſon.—A melancholy calculation!</note>. I have now paſſed that age, and may fairly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the preſent value of my exiſtence in the three-fold diviſion of
mind, body, and eſtate.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt and indiſpenſable requiſite of happineſs is a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
unſullied by the reproach or remembrance of an unworthy
action.</p>

               <l>Nil conſcire ſibi, nullâ palleſcere culpâ.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I am endowed with a cheerful temper, a moderate ſenſibility, and
a natural diſpoſition to repoſe rather than to activity: ſome miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
appetites and habits have perhaps been corrected by philoſophy
or time. The love of ſtudy, a paſſion which derives freſh vigour
from enjoyment, ſupplies each day, each hour, with a perpetual
ſource of independent and rational pleaſure; and I am not ſenſible
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0112200701:208"/>
of any decay of the mental faculties. The original ſoil has been highly
improved by cultivation; but it may be queſtioned, whether ſome

imputed both to the mind and body. 3. I have already deſcribed
the merits of my ſociety and ſituation; but theſe enjoyments would
be taſteleſs or bitter if their poſſeſſion were not aſſured by an annual
and adequate ſupply. According to the ſcale of Switzerland, I am a
rich man; and I am indeed rich, ſince my income is ſuperior to my
expence, and my expence is equal to my wiſhes. My friend Lord
Sheffield has kindly relieved me from the cares to which my taſte and
temper are moſt adverſe: ſhall I add, that ſince the failure of my firſt
wiſhes, I have never entertained any ſerious thoughts of a matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial

            <p>I am diſguſted with the affectation of men of letters, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

My own
experience, at leaſt, has taught me a very different leſſon: twenty
happy years have been animated by the labour of my Hiſtory; and
its ſucceſs has given me a name, a rank, a character, in the world,

I cannot boaſt of the friendſhip or favour of princes; the patronage

great and amiable man added the weight of his own experience; and
this autumnal felicity might be exemplified in the lives of Voltaire,
Hume, and many other men of letters. I am far more inclined to

WHEN I firſt undertook to prepare Mr. Gibbon's Memoirs for
the preſs, I ſuppoſed that it would be neceſſary to introduce
ſome continuation of them, from the time when they ceaſe, namely,
ſoon after his return to Switzerland in the year 1788; but the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of his correſpondence with me ſuggeſted, that the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
would be the publication of his letters from that time to
his death. I ſhall thus give more ſatisfaction, by employing the
language of Mr. Gibbon, inſtead of my own; and the public will
ſee him in a new and (I think) an admirable light, as a writer of
letters. By the inſertion of a few occaſional ſentences, I ſhall obviate
the diſadvantages that are apt to ariſe from an interrupted narration.
A prejudiced or a faſtidious critic may condemn, perhaps, ſome parts
of the letters as trivial; but many readers, I flatter myſelf, will be
gratified by diſcovering even in theſe my friend's affectionate feelings,
and his character in familiar life. His letters in general bear a ſtrong
reſemblance to the ſtyle and turn of his converſation; the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics
of which were vivacity, elegance, and preciſion, with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
aſtoniſhingly extenſive and correct. He never ceaſed to be
inſtructive and entertaining; and in general there was a vein of
pleaſantry in his converſation which prevented its becoming languid,
even during a reſidence of many months with a family in the
country.</p>
            <p>It has been ſuppoſed that he always arranged what he intended to
ſay, before he ſpoke; his quickneſs in converſation contradicts this
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0112200701:212"/>
notion: but it is very true, that before he ſat down to write a note
or letter, he completely arranged in his mind what he meant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.
he purſued the ſame method in reſpect to other compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and he occaſionally would walk ſeveral times about his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before he had rounded a period to his taſte. He has pleaſantly
remarked to me, that it ſometimes coſt him many a turn before he
could throw a ſentiment into a form that gratified his own criticiſm.
His ſyſtematic habit of arrangement in point of ſtyle, aſſiſted, in his
inſtance, by an excellent memory and correct judgment, is much to
be recommended to thoſe who aſpire to any perfection in writing.</p>
            <p>Although the Memoirs extend beyond the time of Mr. Gibbon's
return to Lauſanne, I ſhall inſert a few Letters, written immediately
after his arrival there, and combine them ſo far as to include even the
laſt note which he wrote a few days previouſly to his death. Some
of them contain few incidents; but they connect and carry on the
account either of his opinions or of his employment.</p>

after a very pleaſant journey I arrived here about half an hour
ago; that I am as well arranged, as if I had never ſtirred from this

I dropt at his country-houſe about two leagues off. I juſt ſaluted
the family, who dine with me the day after to-morrow, and return
to town for ſome days, I hope weeks, on my account. The ſon is
an amiable and grateful youth; and even this journey has taught
me to know and to love him ſtill better. My ſatisfaction would be
complete, had I not found a ſad and ſerious alteration in poor Dey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdun:
but thus our joys are chequered! I embrace all; and at

this letter or information, without delay, from Sheffield-Place to Bath.

               <p>SATURDAY is now arrived, and I much doubt whether I ſhall have
time to finiſh. I roſe, as uſual, about ſeven; but as I knew I ſhould
have ſo much time, you know it would have been ridiculous to
begin any thing before breakfaſt. When I returned from my break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt-room
to the library, unluckily I found on the table ſome new
and intereſting books, which inſtantly caught my attention; and
without injuring my correſpondent, I could ſafely beſtow a ſingle
hour to gratify my curioſity. Some things which I found in them
inſenſibly led me to other books, and other enquiries; the morning
has ſtolen away, and I ſhall be ſoon ſummoned to dreſs and dine
with the two Severys, father and ſon, who are returned from the
country on a diſagreeable errand, an illneſs of Madame, from which
ſhe is however recovering. Such is the faithful picture of my mind
and manners, and from a ſingle day <hi>diſce omnes.</hi> After having been
ſo long chained to the oar, in a ſplendid galley indeed, I freely and
fairly enjoy my liberty as I promiſed in my preface; range without
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0112200701:215"/>
control over the wide expanſe of my library; converſe, as my fancy
prompts me, with poets and hiſtorians, philoſophers and orators, of
every age and language; and often indulge my meditations in the
invention and arrangement of mighty works, which I ſhall probably
never find time or application to execute. My garden, berçeau, and
pavilion often varied the ſcene of my ſtudies; the beautiful weather
which we have enjoyed exhilarated my ſpirits, and I again taſted the
wiſdom and happineſs of my retirement, till that happineſs was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by a very ſerious calamity, which took from me for above a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
all thoughts of ſtudy, of amuſement, and even of correſpondence.
I mentioned in my firſt letter the uneaſineſs I felt at poor Deyverdun's
declining health, how much the pleaſure of my life was embittered by
the ſight of a ſuffering and languid friend. The joy of our meeting
appeared at firſt to revive him; and, though not ſatisfied, I began
to think, at leaſt to hope, that he was every day gaining ground;
when, alas! one morning I was ſuddenly recalled from my berçeau
to the houſe, with the dreadful intelligence of an apoplectic ſtroke;
I found him ſenſeleſs: the beſt aſſiſtance was inſtantly collected; and
he had the aid of the genius and experience of Mr. Tiſſot, and of the
aſſiduous care of another phyſician, who for ſome time ſcarcely
quitted his bedſide either night or day. While I was in momentary
dread of a relapſe, with a confeſſion from his phyſicians that ſuch a
relapſe muſt be fatal, you will feel that I was much more to be
pitied than my friend. At length, art or nature triumphed over the
enemy of life. I was ſoon aſſured that all immediate danger was
paſt; and now for many days I have had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing
him recover, though by ſlow degrees, his health and ſtrength, his
ſleep and appetite. He now walks about the garden, and receives
his particular friends, but has not yet gone abroad. His future
health will depend very much upon his own prudence: but, at all
events, this has been a very ſerious warning; and the ſlighteſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
will hereafter aſſume a very formidable aſpect. But let us
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0112200701:216"/>
turn from this melancholy ſubject.—The Man of the People eſcaped
from the tumult, the bloody tumult of the Weſtminſter election,
to the lakes and mountains of Switzerland, and I was informed
that he was arrived at the Lyon d'Or. I ſent a compliment; he
anſwered it in perſon, and ſettled at my houſe for the remainder of
the day. I have eat and drank, and converſed and ſat up all night
with Fox in England; but it never has happened, perhaps it never
can happen again, that I ſhould enjoy him as I did that day, alone,
from ten in the morning till ten at night. Poor Deyverdun, before
his accident, wanted ſpirits to appear, and has regretted it ſince.
Our converſation never flagged a moment; and he ſeemed thoroughly
pleaſed with the place and with his company. We had little politics;
though he gave me, in a few words, ſuch a character of Pitt, as one
great man ſhould give of another his rival: much of books, from my
own, on which he flattered me very pleaſantly, to Homer and the
Arabian Nights: much about the country, my garden (which he
underſtands far better than I do), and, upon the whole, I think he
envies me, and would do ſo were he miniſter. The next morning
I gave him a guide to walk him about the town and country, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
ſome company to meet him at dinner. The following day he
continued his journey to Bern and Zurich, and I have heard of him
by various means. The people gaze on him as a prodigy, but he
ſhews little inclination to converſe with them, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Our friend
<hi>Douglas</hi> has been curious, attentive, agreeable; and in every place
where he has reſided ſome days, he has left acquaintance who
eſteem and regret him: I never knew ſo clear and general an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>After this long letter I have yet many things to ſay, though none
of any preſſing conſequence. I hope you are not idle in the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

               <p>BEFORE your letter, which I received yeſterday, I was in the
anxious ſituation of a king, who hourly expects a courier from his
general, with the news of a deciſive engagement. I had abſtained
from writing, for fear of dropping a word, or betraying a feeling,
which might render you too cautious or too bold. On the famous
8th of April, between twelve and two, I reflected that the buſineſs
was determined; and each ſucceeding day I computed the ſpeedy
approach of your meſſenger, with favourable or melancholy tidings.
When I broke the ſeal, I expected to read, <q>What a damned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
fellow you are! Nothing tolerable was offered, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignantly
withdrew the eſtate.</q> I <hi>did</hi> remember the fate of poor
Lenborough, and I was afraid of your magnanimity, &amp;c. It is
whimſical enough, but it is human nature, that I now begin to think
of the deep-rooted foundations of land, and the airy fabric of the
funds. I not only conſent, but even wiſh, to have eight or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds on a good mortgage. The pipe of wine you ſent to me
was ſeized, and would have been confiſcated, if the government of
Berne had not treated me with the moſt flattering and diſtinguiſhed
civility: they not only releaſed the wine, but they paid out of their own
pocket the ſhares to which the bailiff and the informer were entitled
by law. I ſhould not forget that the bailiff refuſed to accept of his
part. Poor Deyverdun's conſtitution is quite broken; he has had
two or three attacks, not ſo violent as the firſt: every time the door
is haſtily opened, I expect to hear of ſome fatal accident: the beſt or
worſt hopes of the phyſicians are only that he may linger ſome time
longer; but, if he lives till the ſummer, they propoſe ſending him to
ſome mineral waters at Aix, in Savoy. You will be glad to hear
that I am now aſſured of poſſeſſing, during my life, this delightful
houſe and garden. The act has been lately executed in the beſt
form, and the handſomeſt manner. I know not what to ſay of your
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0112200701:219"/>
miracles at home: we rejoice in the king's recovery, and its miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
conſequences; and I cannot be inſenſible to the hope, at leaſt the
chance, of ſeeing in this country a firſt lord of trade, or ſecretary at
war. In your anſwer, which I ſhall impatiently expect, you will
give me a full and true account of your deſigns, which by this time
muſt have dropt, or be determined at leaſt, for the preſent year. If
you come, it is high time that we ſhould look out for a houſe—a
taſk much leſs eaſy than you may poſſibly imagine. Among new
books, I recommend to you the Count de Mirabeau's great work,
"Sur la Monarchie Pruſſienne;" it is in your own way, and gives a

               <p>POOR Deyverdun is no more: he expired Saturday the 4th inſtant;
and in his unfortunate ſituation, death could only be viewed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and by his friends, in the light of a conſummation devoutly to
be wiſhed. Since September he has had a dozen apoplectic ſtrokes,
more or leſs violent: in the intervals between them his ſtrength gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
decayed; every principle of life was exhauſted; and had he
continued to drag a miſerable exiſtence, he muſt probably have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
the loſs of his faculties. Of all misfortunes this was what he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0112200701:221"/>
himſelf moſt apprehended: but his reaſon was clear and calm to the
laſt; he beheld his approaching diſſolution with the firmneſs of a
philoſopher. I fancied that time and reflection had prepared me for
the event; but the habits of three-and-thirty years friendſhip are not
ſo eaſily broken. The firſt days, and more eſpecially the firſt nights,
were indeed painful. Laſt Wedneſday and Saturday it would not
have been in my power to write. I muſt now recollect myſelf, ſince
it is neceſſary for me not only to impart the news, but to aſk your
opinion in a very ſerious and doubtful queſtion, which muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
without loſs of time. I ſhall ſtate the facts, but as I am on the
ſpot, and as new lights may occur, I do not promiſe implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Had my poor friend died without a will, a female <hi>firſt</hi> couſin
ſettled ſomewhere in the north of Germany, and whom I believe he
had never ſeen, would have been his heir at law. In the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
he had ſeveral couſins; and one of theſe, an old companion, by
name Mr. de Montagny, he has choſen for his heir. As this houſe
and garden was the beſt and cleareſt part of poor Deyverdun's
fortune; as there is a heavy duty or fine (what they call <hi>lods</hi>) on
every change of property out of the legal deſcent; as Montagny has
a ſmall eſtate and a large family, it was neceſſary to make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
in his favour. The will therefore leaves me the option of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
this place during my life, on paying the ſum of 250l. (I
reckon in Engliſh money) at preſent, and an annual rent of 30l.; or
elſe, of purchaſing the houſe and garden for a ſum which, including
the duty, will amount to 2500l. If I value the rent of 30l. at
twelve years purchaſe, I may acquire my enjoyment for life at about
the rate of 600l.; and the remaining 1900l. will be the difference
between that tenure and abſolute perpetual property. As you have
never accuſed me of too much zeal for the intereſt of poſterity, you
will eaſily gueſs which ſcale at firſt preponderated. I deeply felt the
advantage of acquiring, for the ſmaller ſum, every poſſible enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0112200701:222"/>
as long as I myſelf ſhould be capable of enjoying: I rejected,
with ſcorn, the idea of giving 1900l. for ideal poſthumous property;
and I deemed it of little moment whoſe name, after my death,
ſhould be inſcribed on my houſe and garden at Lauſanne. How
often did I repeat to myſelf the philoſophical lines of Pope, which
ſeem to determine the queſtion:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Pray Heaven, cries Swift, it laſt as you go on;</l>
                  <l>I wiſh to God this houſe had been your own.</l>
                  <l>Pity to build without or ſon or wife:</l>
                  <l>Why, you'll enjoy it <hi>only</hi> all your life.</l>
                  <l>Well, if the uſe be mine, does it concern one,</l>
                  <l>Whether the name belong to Pope or Vernon?</l>
               </lg>
               <p>In this ſtate of ſelf-ſatisfaction I was not much diſturbed by all my
real or nominal friends, who exhort me to prefer the right of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe:
among ſuch friends, ſome are careleſs and ſome are ignorant;
and the judgment of thoſe, who are able and willing to form an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is often biaſſed by ſome ſelfiſh or ſocial affection, by ſome
viſible or inviſible intereſt. But my own reflections have gradually
and forcibly driven me from my firſt propenſity; and theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I will now proceed to enumerate:</p>
               <p>1. I can make this purchaſe with eaſe and prudence. As I have
had the pleaſure of <hi>not</hi> hearing from you very lately, I flatter myſelf
that you advance on a carpet road, and that almoſt by the receipt of
this letter (July 31ſt) the acres of Beriton will be tranſmuted into
ſixteen thouſand pounds: if the payment be not abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted
by that day, * * * * * will not ſcruple, I ſuppoſe, depoſiting the
2600l. at Goſling's, to meet my draught. Should he heſitate, I can
deſire Darrel to ſell <hi>quantum ſufficit</hi> of my ſhort annuities. As ſoon
as the new ſettlement of my affairs is made, I ſhall be able, after
deducting this ſum, to ſquare my expence to my income, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. On mature conſideration, I am perhaps leſs ſelfiſh and leſs phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
than I appear at firſt ſight: indeed, were I not ſo, it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0112200701:223"/>
would now be in my power to turn my fortune into life-annuities,
and let the Devil take the hindmoſt. I feel, (perhaps it is fooliſh,)
but I feel that this little paradiſe will pleaſe me ſtill more when it is
abſolutely my own; and that I ſhall be encouraged in every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of uſe or beauty, by the proſpect that, after my departure,
it will be enjoyed by ſome perſon of my own choice. I ſometimes
reflect with pleaſure that my writings will ſurvive me; and that idea
is at leaſt as vain and chimerical.</p>
               <p>3. The heir, Mr. de Montagny, is an old acquaintance. My ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a life-holder is rather new and ſingular in this country: the
laws have not provided for many nice caſes which may ariſe between
the landlord and tenant: ſome I can foreſee, others have been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted,
many more I might feel when it would be too late. His
right of property might plague and confine me; he might forbid my
lending to a friend, inſpect my conduct, check my improvements,
call for ſecurities, repairs, &amp;c. But if I purchaſe, I walk on my
own terrace fierce and erect, the free maſter of one of the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſpots on the globe.</p>
               <p>Should I ever migrate homewards, (you ſtare, but ſuch an event
is leſs improbable than I could have thought it two years ago,) this
place would be diſputed by ſtrangers and natives.</p>
               <p>Weigh theſe reaſons, and ſend me without delay a rational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
opinion, to which I ſhall pay ſuch regard as the nature of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
will allow. But, alas! when all is determined, I ſhall
poſſeſs this houſe, by whatſoever tenure, without friendſhip or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
ſociety. I did not imagine, ſix years ago, that a plan of life
ſo congenial to my wiſhes, would ſo ſpeedily vaniſh. I cannot write
upon any other ſubject. Adieu, your's ever.</p>

               <p>AFTER receiving and diſpatching the power of attorny, laſt Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,
I opened, with ſome palpitation, the unexpected miſſive
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0112200701:224"/>
which arrived this morning. The peruſal of the contents ſpoiled
my breakfaſt. They are diſagreeable in themſelves, alarming in
their conſequences, and peculiarly unpleaſant at the preſent moment,
when I hoped to have formed and ſecured the arrangements of my
future life. I do not perfectly underſtand what are theſe deeds
which are ſo inflexibly required; the wills and marriage-ſettlements
I have ſufficiently anſwered. But your arguments do not convince
* * * * *, and I have very little hope from the Lenborough ſearch.
What will be the event? If his objections are only the reſult of
legal ſcrupuloſity, ſurely they might be removed, and every chink
might be filled, by a general bond of indemnity, in which I boldly
aſk you to join, as it will be a ſubſtantial important act of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
without any poſſible riſk to yourſelf or your ſucceſſors. Should
he ſtill remain obdurate, I muſt believe what I already ſuſpect, that
* * * repents of his purchaſe, and wiſhes to elude the concluſion.
Our caſe would be then hopeleſs, <hi>ibi omnis effuſus labor,</hi> and the
eſtate would be returned on our hands with the taint of a bad title.
The refuſal of mortgage does not pleaſe me; but ſurely our offer
ſhews ſome confidence in the goodneſs of my title. If he will not
take eight thouſand pounds at <hi>four per cent.</hi> we muſt look out elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
new doubts and delays will ariſe, and I am perſuaded that
you will not place an implicit confidence in any attorney. I know
not as yet your opinion about my Lauſanne purchaſe. If you are
againſt it, the preſent poſition of affairs gives you great advantage,
&amp;c. &amp;c. The Severys are all well; an uncommon circumſtance for
the four perſons of the family at once. They are now at Mex, a
country-houſe ſix miles from hence, which I viſit to-morrow for
two or three days. They often come to town, and we ſhall contrive
to paſs a part of the autumn together at Rolle. I want to change
the ſcene; and beautiful as the garden and proſpect muſt appear to
every eye, I feel that the ſtate of my own mind caſts a gloom over
them; every ſpot, every walk, every bench, recals the memory of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0112200701:225"/>
thoſe hours, of thoſe converſations, which will return no more. But
I tear myſelf from the ſubject. I could not help writing to-day,
though I do not find I have ſaid any thing very material. As you
muſt be conſcious that you have agitated me, you will not poſtpone
any agreeable, or even <hi>deciſive</hi> intelligence. I almoſt heſitate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſhall run over to England, to conſult with you on the ſpot,
and to fly from poor Deyverdun's ſhade, which meets me at every
turn. I did not expect to have felt his loſs ſo ſharply. But ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles! Why are we ſo far off?</p>
               <p>Once more, What is the difficulty of the title? Will men of
ſenſe, in a ſenſible country, never get rid of the tyranny of lawyers?
more oppreſſive and ridiculous than even the old yoke of the clergy.
Is not a term of ſeventy or eighty years, nearly twenty in my own
perſon, ſufficient to prove our legal poſſeſſion? Will not the records
of fines and recoveries atteſt that <hi>I</hi> am free from any bar of entails
and ſettlements? Conſult ſome ſage of the law, whether their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
demand be neceſſary and legal. If your ground be firm, force
them to execute the agreement or forfeit the depoſit. But if, as I
much fear, they have a right, and a wiſh, to elude the conſummation,
would it not be better to releaſe them at once, than to be hung up
for five years, as in the caſe of Lovegrove, which coſt me in the
end four or five thouſand pounds? You are bold, you are wiſe;
conſult, reſolve, act. In my penultimate letter I dropped a ſtrange
hint, that a migration homeward was not impoſſible. I know not
what to ſay; my mind is all afloat; yet you will not reproach me with
caprice or inconſtancy. How many years did you damn my ſcheme
of retiring to Lauſanne! I executed that plan; I found as much
happineſs as is compatible with human nature, and during four
years (1783—1787) I never breathed a ſigh of repentance. On
my return from England the ſcene was changed: I found only a
faint ſemblance of Deyverdun, and that ſemblance was each day
fading from my ſight. I have paſſed an anxious year, but my
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0112200701:226"/>
anxiety is now at an end, and the proſpect before me is a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
ſolitude. I am ſtill deeply rooted in this country; the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of this paradiſe, the friendſhip of the Severys, a mode of
ſociety ſuited to my taſte, and the enormous trouble and <hi>expence</hi> of
a migration. Yet in England (when the preſent clouds are diſpelled)
I could form a very comfortable eſtabliſhment in London, or rather
at Bath; and I have a very noble country-ſeat at about ten miles
from Eaſt Grinſtead in Suſſex<note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to Sheffield-Place.</note>. That ſpot is dearer to me than the
reſt of the three kingdoms; and I have ſometimes wondered how
two men, ſo oppoſite in their tempers and purſuits, ſhould have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
ſo long and lively a propenſity for each other. Sir Stanier
Porten is juſt dead. He has left his widow with a moderate penſion,
and two children, my neareſt relations: the eldeſt, Charlotte, is
about Louiſa's age, and alſo a moſt amiable ſenſible young creature.
I have conceived a romantic idea of educating and adopting her;
as we deſcend into the vale of years our infirmities require ſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
female ſociety: Charlotte would be the comfort of my age,
and I could reward her care and tenderneſs with a decent fortune.
A thouſand difficulties oppoſe the execution of the plan, which I
have never opened but to you; yet it would be leſs impracticable
in England than in Switzerland. Adieu. I am wounded; pour
ſome oil into my wounds: yet I am leſs unhappy ſince I have
thrown my mind upon paper.</p>
               <p>Are you not amazed at the French revolution? They have the
power, will they have the moderation, to eſtabliſh a good conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution?

               <p>WITHIN an hour after the reception of your laſt, I drew my
pen for the purpoſe of a reply, and my exordium ran in the following
words: <q>I find by experience, that it is much more rational, as well
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0112200701:227"/>
as eaſy, to anſwer a letter of real buſineſs by the return of the
poſt.</q> This important truth is again verified by my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
After writing three pages I was called away by a very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
motive, and the poſt departed before I could return to the
concluſion. A ſecond delay was coloured by ſome decent pretence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Three weeks have ſlipped away, and I now force myſelf on a taſk,
which I ſhould have diſpatched without an effort on the firſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
My only excuſe is, that I had little to write about Engliſh
buſineſs, and that I could write nothing definitive about my Swiſs
affairs. And firſt, as Ariſtotle ſays of the firſt,</p>
               <p>1. I was indeed in low ſpirits when I ſent what you ſo juſtly ſtile
my diſmal letter; but I do aſſure you, that my own feelings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
much more to ſink me, than any events or terrors relative to
the ſale of Beriton. But I again hope and truſt, from your conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
epiſtle, that, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. My Swiſs tranſaction has ſuffered a great alteration. I ſhall
not become the proprietor of my houſe and garden at Lauſanne, and
I relinquiſh the phantom with more regret than you could eaſily
imagine. But I have been determined by a difficulty, which at firſt
appeared of little moment, but which has gradually ſwelled to an
alarming magnitude. There is a law in this country, as well as in
ſome provinces of France, which is ſtyled <hi>le droit de retrait, le retrait
lignagere,</hi> (Lord Loughborough muſt have heard of it,) by which
the relations of the deceaſed are entitled to redeem a houſe or eſtate
at the price for which it has been ſold; and as the ſum fixed by
poor Deyverdun is much below its known value, a crowd of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
are beginning to ſtart. The beſt opinions (for they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided)
are in my favour, that I am not ſubject to <hi>le droit de retrait,</hi>
ſince I take not as a purchaſer, but as a legatee. But the words of
the will are ſomewhat ambiguous, the event of law is always uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the adminiſtration of juſtice at Bern (the laſt appeal) depends
too much on favour and intrigue; and it is very doubtful whether I
could revert to the life-holding, after having choſen and loſt the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0112200701:228"/>
property. Theſe conſiderations engaged me to open a negociation
with Mr. de Montagny, through the medium of my friend the judge;
and as he moſt ardently wiſhes to keep the houſe, he conſented,
though with ſome reluctance, to my propoſals. Yeſterday he ſigned
a covenant in the moſt regular and binding form, by which he
allows my power of transferring my intereſt, interprets in the moſt
ample ſenſe my right of making alterations, and expreſsly renounces
all claim, as landlord, of viſiting or inſpecting the premiſes. I have
promiſed to lend him twelve thouſand livres, (between ſeven and
eight hundred pounds,) ſecured on the houſe and land. The mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
is four times its value; the intereſt of four pounds <hi>per cent.</hi> will
be annually diſcharged by the rent of thirty guineas. So that I am
now tranquil on that ſcore for the remainder of my days. I hope
that time will gradually reconcile me to the place which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
with my poor friend; for in ſpite of the <hi>cream</hi> of London,
I am ſtill perſuaded that no other place is ſo well adapted to my taſte
and habits of ſtudious and ſocial life.</p>
               <p>Far from delighting in the whirl of a metropolis, my only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
againſt Lauſanne is the great number of ſtrangers, always of
Engliſh, and now of French, by whom we are infeſted in ſummer.
Yet we have eſcaped the <hi>damned</hi> great ones, the Count d'Artois, the
Polignacs, &amp;c. who ſlip by us to Turin. What a ſcene is France!
While the aſſembly is voting abſtract propoſitions, Paris is an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
republic; the provinces have neither authority nor freedom,
and poor Necker declares that credit is no more, and that the people
refuſe to pay taxes. Yet I think you muſt be ſeduced by the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
of tithes. If Eden goes to Paris you may have ſome curious
information. Give me ſome account of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas. Do
they live with Lord North? I hope they do. When will parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be diſſolved? Are you ſtill Coventry-mad? I embrace my
Lady, the ſprightly Maria, and the ſmiling Louiſa. Alas! alas!
you will never come to Switzerland. Adieu, ever yours.</p>

I had totally forgotten the deed in queſtion, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
in the laſt year of my father's life, to tie his hands and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the diſorder of his affairs; and which might have been ſo eaſily
cancelled by Sir Stanier, who had not the ſmalleſt intereſt in it,
either for himſelf or his family. The amicable ſuit, which is now
become neceſſary, muſt, I think, be ſhort and unambiguous, yet I
cannot help dreading the crotchets, that lurk under the chancellor's
great wig; and, at all events, I foreſee ſome additional delay and
expence. The golden pill of the two thouſand eight hundred pounds
has ſoothed my diſcontent; and if it be ſafely lodged with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
I agree with you, in conſidering it as an unequivocal pledge of
a fair and willing purchaſer. It is indeed chiefly in that light I now
rejoice in ſo large a depoſit, which is no longer neceſſary in its full
extent. You are appriſed by my laſt letter that I have reduced
myſelf to the life-enjoyment of the houſe and garden. And, in
ſpite of my feelings, I am every day more convinced that I have
choſen the ſafer ſide. I believe my cauſe to have been good, but
it was doubtful. Law in this country is not ſo expenſive as in
England, but it is more troubleſome; I muſt have gone to Bern,
have ſolicited my judges in perſon; a vile cuſtom! the event was
uncertain; and during at leaſt two years, I ſhould have been in a
ſtate of ſuſpenſe and anxiety; till the concluſion of which it would
have been madneſs to have attempted any alteration or improvement.
According to my preſent arrangement I ſhall want no more than
eleven hundred pounds of the two thouſand, and I ſuppoſe you will
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0112200701:230"/>
direct Goſling to lay out the remainder in India bonds, that it may
not lie quite dead, while I am accountable to * * * * for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
The elderly lady in a male habit, who informed me that
Yorkſhire is a regiſter county, is a certain judge, one Sir William
Blackſtone, whoſe name you may poſſibly have heard. After ſtating
the danger of purchaſers and creditors, with regard to the title of
eſtates on which they lay out or lend their money, he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues:
<q>In Scotland every act and event regarding the tranſmiſſion
of property is regularly entered on record; and ſome of our own
provincial diviſions, particularly the extended county of York
and the populous county of Middleſex, have prevailed with the
legiſlature to erect ſuch regiſters in their reſpective diſtricts.</q>
(Blackſtone's Commentaries, vol. ii. p. 343, edition of 1774, in
quarto.) If I am miſtaken, it is in pretty good company; but I
ſuſpect that we are all right, and that the regiſter is confined to one
or two ridings. As we have, alas! two or three months before us, I
ſhould hope that your prudent ſagacity will diſcover ſome ſound
land, in caſe you ſhould not have time to arrange another mortgage.
I now write in a hurry, as I am juſt ſetting out for Rolle, where I
ſhall be ſettled with cook and ſervants in a pleaſant apartment, till
the middle of November. The Severys have a houſe there, where
they paſs the autumn. I am not ſorry to vary the ſcene for a few
weeks, and I wiſh to be abſent while ſome alterations are making in
my houſe at Lauſanne. I wiſh the change of air may be of ſervice to
Severy the father, but we do not at all like his preſent ſtate of health.
How completely, alas, how completely! could I now lodge you:
but your firm reſolve of making me a viſit ſeems to have vaniſhed
like a dream. Next ſummer you will not find five hundred pounds
for a rational friendly expedition; and ſhould parliament be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
you will perhaps find five thouſand for—. I cannot
think of it with patience. Pray take ſerious ſtrenuous meaſures for
ſending me a pipe of excellent Madeira in caſk, with ſome dozens

of Malmſey Madeira. It ſhould be conſigned to Meſſrs. Romberg
Voituriers at Oſtend, and I muſt have timely notice of its march.
We have ſo much to ſay about France, that I ſuppoſe we ſhall never

the moſt important of <hi>my own</hi> affairs; for I will preſume to aſſert,
that in a buſineſs of yours of equal conſequence, you ſhould not
find me cold or careleſs. But on the preſent occaſion my ſilence is,
perhaps, the higheſt compliment I ever paid you. You remember
the anſwer of Philip of Macedon: <q>Philip may ſleep, while he
knows that Parmenio is awake.</q> I expected, and, to ſay the
truth, I wiſhed that my Parmenio would have decided and acted,
without expecting my dilatory anſwer, and in his deciſion I ſhould
have acquieſced with implicit confidence. But ſince you will have
my opinion, let us conſider the preſent ſtate of my affairs. In the
courſe of my life I have often known, and ſometimes felt, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of getting money, but I now find myſelf involved in a more
ſingular diſtreſs, the difficulty of placing it, and if it continues much
longer, I ſhall almoſt wiſh for my land again.</p>
               <p>I perfectly agree with you, that it is bad management to purchaſe
in the funds when they do not yield four pounds <hi>per cent.</hi> *
* * * * * * * * * * * *.
Some of this money I can place ſafely, by means of my banker
here; and I ſhall poſſeſs, what I have always deſired, a command of
caſh, which I cannot abuſe to my prejudice, ſince I have it in my
power to ſupply with my pen any extraordinary or fanciful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of expence. And ſo much, much indeed, for pecuniary
matters. What would you have me ſay of the affairs of France?
We are too near, and too remote, to form an accurate judgment of
that wonderful ſcene. The abuſes of the court and government
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0112200701:232"/>
called aloud for reformation; and it has happened, as it will always
happen, tha an innocent well-diſpoſed Prince has paid the forfeit of
the ſins of his predeceſſors; of the ambition of Lewis the Fourteenth,
of the profuſion of Lewis the Fifteenth. The French nation had a
glorious opportunity, but they have abuſed, and may loſe their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
If they had been content with a liberal tranſlation of our
ſyſtem, if they had reſpected the prerogatives of the crown, and the
privileges of the nobles, they might have raiſed a ſolid fabric on the
only true foundation, the natural ariſtocracy of a great country.
How different is the proſpect! Their King brought a captive to
Paris, after his palace had been ſtained with the blood of his guards;
the nobles in exile; the clergy plundered in a way which ſtrikes at
the root of all property; the capital an independent republic; the
union of the provinces diſſolved; the flames of diſcord kindled by
the worſt of men; (in that light I conſider Mirabeau;) and the
honeſteſt of the aſſembly, a ſet of wild viſionaries, (like our Dr.
Price,) who gravely debate, and dream about the eſtabliſhment of
a pure and perfect democracy of five-and-twenty millions, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the golden age, and the primitive rights and equality of
mankind, which would lead, in fair reaſoning, to an equal partition
of lands and money. How many years muſt elapſe before France
can recover any vigour, or reſume her ſtation among the Powers of
Europe! As yet, there is no ſymptom of a great man, a Richlieu
or a Cromwell, ariſing, either to reſtore the monarchy, or to lead the
commonwealth. The weight of Paris, more deeply engaged in the
funds than <hi>all</hi> the reſt of the kingdom, will long delay a bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy;
and if it ſhould happen, it will be, both in the cauſe and
the effect, a meaſure of weakneſs, rather than of ſtrength. You
ſend me to Chamberry, to ſee a Prince and an Archbiſhop. Alas!
we have exiles enough here, with the Marſhal de Caſtries and the
Duke de Guignes at their head; and this inundation of ſtrangers,
which uſed to be confined to the ſummer, will now ſtagnate all the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0112200701:233"/>
winter. The only ones whom I have ſeen with pleaſure are
Mr. Mounier, the late preſident of the national aſſembly, and the
Count de Lally; they have both dined with me. Mounier, who is
a ſerious dry politician, is returned to Dauphine. Lally is an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man of the world, and a poet: he paſſes the winter here. You
know how much I prefer a quiet ſelect ſociety to a crowd of
names and titles, and that I always ſeek converſation with a view
to amuſement, rather than information. What happy countries
are England and Switzerland, if they know and preſerve their
happineſs.</p>
               <p>I have a thouſand things to ſay to my Lady, Maria, and Louiſa,
but I can add only a ſhort poſtſcript about the Madeira. Good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira
is now become eſſential to my health and reputation. May
your hogſhead prove as good as the laſt; may it not be intercepted
by the rebels or the Auſtrians. What a ſcene again in that country!
Happy England! Happy Switzerland! I again repeat, adieu.</p>

               <p>YOUR two laſt epiſtles, of the 7th and 11th inſtant, were ſomewhat
delayed on the road; they arrived within two days of each other,
the laſt this morning (the 27th); ſo that I anſwer by the firſt, or
at leaſt by the ſecond poſt. Upon the whole, your French method,
though ſometimes more rapid, appears to me leſs ſure and ſteady

But enough of this. A new and brighter proſpect ſeems to be break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon us, and few events of <hi>that kind</hi> have ever given me more
pleaſure than your ſucceſsful negociation and * * * *'s ſatisfactory

But I wiſh you to chooſe and execute one or the other of theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements

be at an end, and our friendly pages will be no longer ſullied with
the repetition of dirty land and vile money; when we may expatiate
on the politics of the world and our perſonal ſentiments. Without
expecting your anſwer of buſineſs, I mean to write ſoon in a purer
ſtyle, and I wiſh to lay open to my friend the ſtate of my mind,
which (excluſive of all worldly concerns) is not perfectly at eaſe.
In the mean while, I muſt add two or three ſhort articles. 1. I am

Mine ſhould have departed long ſince, could I have found a ſure
opportunity, &amp;c. &amp;c. Adieu, yours.</p>

               <p>SINCE the firſt origin (<hi>ab ovo</hi>) of our connection and correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſo long an interval of ſilence has not intervened, as far as I
remember, between us, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From my ſilence you conclude that the moral complaint, which I
had inſinuated in my laſt, is either inſignificant or fanciful. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
is raſh. But the complaint in queſtion is of the nature of a ſlow
lingering diſeaſe, which is not attended with any immediate danger.
As I have not leiſure to expatiate, take the idea in three words: <q>Since
the loſs of poor Deyverdun, I am <hi>alone;</hi> and even in Paradiſe, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
is painful to a ſocial mind. When I was a dozen years
younger, I <hi>ſcarcely</hi> felt the weight of a ſingle exiſtence amidſt the
crowds of London, of parliament, of clubs; but it will preſs more
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0112200701:235"/>
heavily upon me in this tranquil land, in the decline of life, and
with the increaſe of infirmities. Some expedient, even the moſt
deſperate, muſt be embraced, to ſecure the domeſtic ſociety of a
male or female companion. But I am not in a hurry; there is
time for reflection and advice.</q> During this winter ſuch ſiner
feelings have been ſuſpended by the groſſer evil of bodily pain. On
the ninth of February I was ſeized by ſuch a fit of the gout as I had
never known, though I muſt be thankful that its dire effects have
been confined to the feet and knees, without aſcending to the more
noble parts. With ſome viciſſitudes of better and worſe, I have
groaned between two and three months; the debility has ſurvived
the pain, and though now eaſy, I am carried about in my chair,
without any power, and with a very diſtant chance, of ſupporting
myſelf, from the extreme weakneſs and contraction of the joints of
my knees. Yet I am happy in a ſkilful phyſician, and kind aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
friends: every evening, during more than three months, has
been enlivened (excepting when I have been forced to refuſe them) by
ſome cheerful viſits, and very often by a choſen party of both ſexes.
How different is ſuch ſociety from the ſolitary evenings which I
have paſſed in the tumult of London! It is not worth while fighting
about a ſhadow, but ſhould I ever return to England, Bath, not the
metropolis, would be my laſt retreat.</p>
               <p>Your portrait is at laſt arrived in perfect condition, and now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupies
a conſpicuous place over the chimney-glaſs in my library. It
is the object of general admiration; good judges (the few) applaud
the work; the name of Reynolds opens the eyes and mouths of the
many; and were not I afraid of making you vain, I would inform
you that the original is not allowed to be more than five-and-thirty.
In ſpite of private reluctance and public diſcontent, I have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0112200701:236"/>
you will be indebted to the preſident one guinea for the carriage.
Do not be nervous, I am not rolled up; had I been ſo, you might
have gazed on my charms four months ago. I want ſome account
of yourſelf, of my Lady, (ſhall we never directly correſpond?) of
Louiſa, and of Maria. How has the latter ſince her launch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
a quiet winter in Suſſex? I ſo much rejoice in your divorce
from that b—Kitty Coventry, that I care not what marriage you
contract. A great city would ſuit your dignity, and the duties
which would kill me in the firſt ſeſſion, would ſupply your activity
with a conſtant fund of amuſement. But tread ſoftly and ſurely;
the ice is deceitful, the water is deep, and you may be ſouſed over
head and ears before you are aware. Why did not you or Elmſley
ſend me the African pamphlet<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations on the Project for aboliſhing the Slave Trade, by Lord Sheffield.</note> by the poſt? it would not have
coſt much. You have ſuch a knack of turning a nation, that I am
afraid you will triumph (perhaps by the force of argument) over
juſtice and humanity. But do you not expect to work at Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub's
ſugar plantations in the infernal regions, under the tender go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a negro-driver? I ſhould ſuppoſe both my Lady and
Miſs Firth very angry with you.</p>
               <p>As to the bill for prints, which has been too long neglected,
why will you not exerciſe the power, which I have never revoked,
over all my caſh at the Goſlings? The Severy family has paſſed a
very favourable winter; the young man is impatient to hear from a
family which he places above all others: yet he will generouſly write
next week, and ſend you a drawing of the alterations in the houſe.
Do not raiſe your ideas; you know <hi>I</hi> am ſatisfied with convenience
in architecture, and ſome elegance in furniture. I admire the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with which you aſk me to epiſtolize Reynell and Elmſley, as if

               <p>YOUR indignation will melt into pity, when you hear that for
ſeveral weeks paſt I have been again confined to my chamber and my
chair. Yet I muſt haſten, generouſly haſten, to exculpate the gout,
my old enemy, from the curſes which you already pour on his head.
He is not the cauſe of this diſorder, although the conſequences have
been ſomewhat ſimilar. I am ſatisfied that this effort of nature has
ſaved me from a very dangerous, perhaps a fatal, criſis; and I liſten
to the flattering hope that it may tend to keep the gout at a more
reſpectful diſtance, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The whole ſheet has been filled with dry ſelfiſh buſineſs; but I
muſt and will reſerve ſome lines of the cover for a little friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
I paſſed four days at the caſtle of Copet with Necker; and
could have wiſhed to have ſhewn him, as a warning to any aſpiring
youth poſſeſſed with the daemon of ambition. With all the means
of private happineſs in his power, he is the moſt miſerable of human
beings: the paſt, the preſent, and the future are equally odious to
him. When I ſuggeſted ſome domeſtic amuſements of books, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. he anſwered, with a deep tone of deſpair, <q>Dans l'êtat ou
je ſuis, je ne puis ſentir que le coup de vent qui m'a abbatû.</q>
How different from the careleſs cheerfulneſs with which our poor
friend Lord North ſupported his fall! Madame Necker maintains
more external compoſure, <hi>mais le Diable n'y perd rien.</hi> It is true
that Necker wiſhed to be carried into the cloſet, like old Pitt, on the
ſhoulders of the people; and that he has been ruined by the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy
which he had raiſed. I believe him to be an able financier, and
know him to be an honeſt man; too honeſt, perhaps, for a miniſter.
His rival Calonne has paſſed through Lauſanne, in his way from
Turin; and was ſoon followed by the Prince of Condé, with his ſon
and grandſon; but I was too much indiſpoſed to ſee them. They
have, or have had, ſome wild projects of a counter-revolution:
horſes have been bought, men levied: ſuch fooliſh attempts muſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0112200701:238"/>
end in the ruin of the party. Burke's book is a moſt admirable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
againſt the French diſeaſe, which has made too much progreſs
even in this happy country. I admire his eloquence, I approve his
politics, I adore his chivalry, and I can forgive even his ſuperſtition.
The primitive church, which I have treated with ſome freedom, was
itſelf at that time an innovation, and I was attached to the old Pagan
eſtabliſhment. The French ſpread ſo many lies about the ſentiments
of the Engliſh nation, that I wiſh the moſt conſiderable men of all
parties and deſcriptions would join in ſome public act, declaring
themſelves ſatisfied and reſolved to ſupport our preſent conſtitution.
Such a declaration would have a wonderful effect in Europe; and,
were I thought worthy, I myſelf would be proud to ſubſcribe it.
I have a great mind to ſend you ſomething of a ſketch, ſuch as all
thinking men might adopt.</p>
               <p>I have intelligence of the approach of my Madeira. I accept with
equal pleaſure the ſecond pipe, now in the Torrid Zone. Send me

               <p>I ANSWER at once your two letters; and I ſhould probably have
taken earlier notice of the firſt, had I not been in daily expectation
of the ſecond. I muſt begin on the ſubject of what really intereſts
me the moſt, your glorious election for Briſtol. Moſt ſincerely do I
congratulate your exchange of a curſed expenſive jilt, who deſerted
you for a rich Jew, for an honourable connection with a chaſte and
virtuous matron, who will probably be as conſtant as ſhe is diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted.
In the whole range of election from Caithneſs to St. Ives,
I much doubt whether there be a ſingle choice ſo truly honourable
to the member and the conſtituents. The ſecond commercial city
invites, from a diſtant province, an independent gentleman, known
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0112200701:239"/>
only by his active ſpirit, and his writings on the ſubject of trade;
and names him, without intrigue or expence, for her repreſentative:
even the voice of party is ſilenced, while factions ſtrive which ſhall
applaud the moſt.</p>
               <p>You are now ſure, for ſeven years to come, of never wanting food;
I mean buſineſs: what a crowd of ſuitors or complainants will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
your door! what a load of letters and memorials will be heaped
on your table! I much queſtion whether even you will not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
exclaim, <hi>Ohe! jam ſatis eſt!</hi> but that is your affair. Of the
excurſion to Coventry I cannot decide, but I hear it is pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
blamed: but, however, I love gratitude to an old friend; and
ſhall not be very angry if you damned them with a farewel to all
eternity. But I cannot repreſs my indignation at the uſe of thoſe
fooliſh, obſolete, odious words, Whig and Tory. In the American
war they might have ſome meaning; and then your Lordſhip was a
Tory, although you ſuppoſed yourſelf a Whig: ſince the coalition,
all general principles have been confounded; and if there ever was
an oppoſition to men, not meaſures, it is the preſent. Luckily both
the leaders are great men; and, whatever happens, the country muſt
fall upon its legs. What a ſtrange miſt of peace and war ſeems to
hang over the ocean! We can perceive nothing but ſecrecy and
vigor; but thoſe are excellent qualities to perceive in a miniſter.
From yourſelf and politics I now return to my private concerns,
which I ſhall methodically conſider under the three great articles of
mind, body, and eſtate.</p>
               <p>1. I am not abſolutely diſpleaſed at your firing ſo haſtily at the
hint, a tremendous hint, in my laſt letter. But the danger is not ſo
ſerious or imminent as you ſeem to ſuſpect; and I give you my
word, that, before I take the ſlighteſt ſtep which can bind me either
in law, conſcience, or honour, I will faithfully communicate, and
we will freely diſcuſs, the whole ſtate of the buſineſs. But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
there is not any thing to communicate or diſcuſs; I do aſſure you
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0112200701:240"/>
that I have not any particular object in view: I am not in love with
any of the hyaenas of Lauſanne, though there are ſome who keep
their claws tolerably well pared. Sometimes, in a ſolitary mood, I
have fancied myſelf married to one or another of thoſe whoſe ſociety
and converſation are the moſt pleaſing to me; but when I have
painted in my fancy all the probable conſequences of ſuch an union,
I have ſtarted from my dream, rejoiced in my eſcape, and ejaculated
a thankſgiving that I was ſtill in poſſeſſion of my natural freedom.
Yet I feel, and ſhall continue to feel, that domeſtic ſolitude, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may be alleviated by the world, by ſtudy, and even by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
is a comfortleſs ſtate, which will grow more painful as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
in the vale of years. At preſent my ſituation is very tolerable;
and if at dinner-time, or at my return home in the evening, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſigh for a companion, there are many hours, and many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
in which I enjoy the ſuperior bleſſing of being ſole maſter of
my own houſe. But your plan, though leſs dangerous, is ſtill more
abſurd than mine: ſuch a couple as you deſcribe could not be found;
and, if found, would not anſwer my purpoſe; their rank and poſition
would be awkward and ambiguous to myſelf and my acquaintance;
and the agreement of three perſons of three characters would be ſtill
more impracticable. My plan of Charlotte Porten is undoubtedly the
moſt deſirable; and ſhe might either remain a ſpinſter (the caſe is not
without example), or marry ſome Swiſs of my choice, who would
increaſe and enliven our ſociety; and both would have the ſtrongeſt
motives for kind and dutiful behaviour. But the mother has been
indirectly ſounded, and will not hear of ſuch a propoſal for ſome
years. On my ſide, I would not take her, but as a piece of ſoft
wax which I could model to the language and manners of the
country: I muſt therefore be patient.</p>
               <p>Young Severy's letter, which may be now in your hands, and
which, for theſe three or four laſt poſts, has furniſhed my indolence
with a new pretence for delay, has already informed you of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0112200701:241"/>
means and circumſtances of my reſurrection. Tedious indeed was
my confinement, ſince I was not able to move from my houſe or
chair, from the ninth of February to the firſt of July, very nearly five
months. The firſt weeks were accompanied with more pain than I
have ever known in the gout, with anxious days and ſleepleſs nights;
and when that pain ſubſided, it left a weakneſs in my knees which
ſeemed to have no end. My confinement was however ſoftened by
books, by the poſſeſſion of every comfort and convenience, by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
each evening of agreeable company, and by a flow of equal
ſpirits and general good health. During the laſt weeks I deſcended
to the ground floor, poor Deyverdun's apartment, and conſtructed a
chair like Merlin's, in which I could wheel myſelf in the houſe and
on the terrace. My patience has been univerſally admired; yet how
many thouſands have paſſed thoſe five months leſs eaſily than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
I remember making a remark perfectly ſimple, and perfectly
true: <q>At preſent, (I ſaid to Madame de Severy,) I am not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
miſerable, and I may reaſonably hope a daily or weekly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
till ſooner or later in the ſummer I ſhall recover new
limbs, and new pleaſures, which I do not now poſſeſs: have any
of you ſuch a proſpect?</q> The prediction has been accompliſhed,
and I have arrived to my preſent condition of ſtrength, or rather of
feebleneſs: I now can walk with tolerable eaſe in my garden and
ſmooth places; but on the rough pavement of the town I uſe, and
perhaps ſhall uſe, a ſedan chair. The Pyrmont waters have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
wonders; and my phyſician (not Tiſſot, but a very ſenſible
man) allows me to hope, that the term of the interval will be in
proportion to that of the fit.</p>
               <p>Have you read in the Engliſh papers, that the government of
Berne is overturned, and that we are divided into three democratical
leagues? true as what I have read in the French papers, that the
Engliſh have cut off Pitt's head, and aboliſhed the Houſe of Lords.
The people of this country are happy; and in ſpite of ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0112200701:242"/>
and more foreign emiſſaries, they are ſenſible of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>Finally—Inform my Lady, that I am indignant at a falſe and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
aſſertion in her laſt letter to Severy, <q>that friends at a diſtance
cannot love each other, if they do not write.</q> I love her better
than any woman in the world; indeed I do; and yet I do not write.
And ſhe herſelf—but I am calm. We have now nearly one hundred
French exiles, ſome of them worth being acquainted with; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
a Count de Schomberg, who is become almoſt my friend;
he is a man of the world, of letters, and of ſufficient age, ſince in
1753 he ſucceeded to Marſhal Saxe's regiment of dragoons. As to
the reſt, I entertain them, and they flatter me: but I wiſh we were
reduced to our Lauſanne ſociety. Poor France! the ſtate is diſſolved,
the nation is mad! Adieu.</p>

the mother and ſon, who directed the oeconomy, and performed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the <hi>fête.</hi> It opened about ſeven in the evening; the aſſembly
of men and women was pleaſed and pleaſing, the muſic good, the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
ſplendid, the refreſhments profuſe: at twelve, one hundred
and thirty perſons ſat down to a very good ſupper: at two, I ſtole away
to bed, in a ſnug corner; and I was informed at breakfaſt, that the
remains of the veteran and young troops, with Severy and his ſiſter
at their head, had concluded the laſt dance about a quarter before
ſeven. This magnificent entertainment has gained me great credit;
and the expence was more reaſonable than you can eaſily imagine.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0112200701:243"/>
This was an extraordinary event, but I give frequent dinners; and
in the ſummer I have an aſſembly every Sunday evening. What a
wicked wretch! ſays my Lady.</p>
               <p>I cannot pity you for the accumulation of buſineſs, as you ought not
to pity <hi>me,</hi> if I complained of the tranquillity of Lauſanne; we ſuffer or
enjoy the effects of our own choice. Perhaps you will mutter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
of our not being born for ourſelves, of public ſpirit (I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
read of ſuch a thing), of private friendſhip, for which I give you
full and ample credit, &amp;c. But your parliamentary operations, at
leaſt, will probably expire in the month of June; and I ſhall refuſe to
ſign the Newhaven conveyance, unleſs I am ſatisfied that you will
execute the Lauſanne viſit this ſummer. On the 15th of June, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Lord, Lady, Maria, and maid, (poor Louiſa!) in a poſt coach,
with Elienne on horſeback, ſet out from Downing-Street, or Sheffield-Place,
croſs the channel from Brighton to Dieppe, viſit the National
Aſſembly, buy caps at Paris, examine the ruins of Verſailles, and arrive
at Lauſanne, without danger or fatigue, the ſecond week in July; you
will be lodged pleaſantly and comfortably, and will not perhaps
deſpiſe my ſituation. A couple of months will roll, alas! too haſtily
away: you will all be amuſed by new ſcenes, new people; and
whenever Maria and you, with Severy, mount on horſeback to viſit
the country, the glaciers, &amp;c. my Lady and myſelf ſhall form a very
quiet tête-à-tête at home. In September, if you are tired, you may
return by a direct or indirect way; but I only deſire that you will not
make the plan impracticable, by graſping at too much. In return, I
promiſe you a viſit of three or four months in the autumn of ninety-two:
you and my bookſellers are now my principal attractions in
England. You had ſome right to growl at hearing of my ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the papers: but Cadell's indiſcretion was founded on a hint
which I had thrown out in a letter, and which in all probability will
never be executed. Yet I am not totally idle. Adieu.</p>

               <p>AT length I ſee a ray of ſunſhine breaking from a dark cloud.
Your epiſtle of the 13th arrived this morning, the 25th inſtant, the
day after my return from Geneva; it has been communicated to
Severy. We now believe that you intend a viſit to Lauſanne this
ſummer, and we hope that you will execute that intention. If you
are a man of honour, you ſhall find me one; and, on the day of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0112200701:245"/>
your arrival at Lauſanne, I will ratify my engagement of viſiting the
Britiſh iſle before the end of the year 1792, excepting only the fair
and foul exception of the gout. You rejoice me, by propoſing the
addition of dear Louiſa; it was not without a bitter pang that I
threw her overboard, to lighten the veſſel and ſecure the voyage: I
was fearful of the governeſs, a ſecond carriage, and a long train of
difficulty and expence, which might have ended in blowing up the
whole ſcheme. But if you can bodkin the ſweet creature into the
coach, ſhe will find an eaſy welcome at Lauſanne. The firſt arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which I muſt make before your arrival, may be altered by
your own taſte, on a ſurvey of the premiſes, and you will all be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly
and pleaſantly lodged. You have heard a great deal of
the beauty of my houſe, garden, and ſituation; but ſuch are their
intrinſic value, that, unleſs I am much deceived, they will bear the
teſt even of exaggerated praiſe. From my knowledge of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I have always entertained some doubt how you would get
through the ſociety of a Lauſanne winter: but I am ſatisfied that,
excluſive of friendſhip, your ſummer viſits to the banks of the Leman
Lake will long be remembered as one of the moſt agreeable periods
of your life; and that you will ſcarcely regret the amuſement of a
Suſſex Committee of Navigation in the dog days. You aſk for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails:
what details? a map of France and a poſt-book are eaſy and
infallible guides. If the ladies are not afraid of the ocean, you are
not ignorant of the paſſage from Brighton to Dieppe: Paris will then
be in your direct road; and even allowing you to look at the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonium,
the ruins of Verſailles, &amp;c. a fortnight diligently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
will clear you from Sheffield Place to Gibbon Caſtle. What
can I ſay more?</p>
               <p>As little have I to ſay on the ſubject of my worldly matters, which
ſeem now, Jupiter be praiſed, to be drawing towards a final conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
ſince when people part with their money, they are indeed
ſerious. I do not perfectly underſtand the ratio of the preciſe ſum
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0112200701:246"/>
which you have poured into Goſling's reſervoir, but ſuppoſe it will
be explained in a general account.</p>
               <p>You have been very dutiful in ſending me, what I have always
deſired, a cut Woodfall on a remarkable debate; a debate, indeed,
moſt remarkable! Poor * * * * * is the moſt eloquent and rational mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that I ever knew. I love * * *'s feelings, but I deteſt the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
principles of the man, and of the party. Formerly, you deteſted
them more ſtrongly during the American war, than myſelf. I am
half afraid that you are corrupted by your unfortunate connections.
Should you admire the National Aſſembly, we ſhall have many an
altercation, for I am as high an ariſtocrat as Burke himſelf; and he
has truly obſerved, that it is impoſſible to debate with temper on the
ſubject of that curſed revolution. In my laſt excurſion to Geneva
I frequently ſaw the Neckers, who by this time are returned to their
ſummer reſidence at Copet. He is much reſtored in health and
ſpirits, eſpecially ſince the publication of his laſt book, which has
probably reached England. Both parties, who agree in abuſing him,
agree likewiſe that he is a man of virtue and genius; but I much fear
that the pureſt intentions have been productive of the moſt baneful
conſequences. Our military men, I mean the French, are leaving
us every day for the camp of the Princes at Worms, and ſupport
what is called repreſentation. Their hopes are ſanguine;
I will not anſwer for their being well grounded: it is <hi>certain,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that the emperor had an interview the 19th inſtant with the
Count of Artois at Mantua; and the ariſtocrats talk in myſterious
language of Spain, Sardinia, the Empire, four or five armies, &amp;c.
They will doubtleſs ſtrike a blow this ſummer: may it not recoil on
their own heads! Adieu. Embrace our female travellers. A ſhort

            <p>IT has appeared from the foregoing Letters, that a viſit from
myſelf and my family, to Mr. Gibbon at Lauſanne, had been for
ſome time in agitation. This long-promiſed excurſion took place
in the month of June 1791, and occaſioned a conſiderable ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our correſpondence. I landed at Dieppe immediately after
the flight from, and return to, Paris of the unfortunate Lewis XVI.
During my ſtay in that capital, I had an opportunity of ſeeing the
extraordinary ferment of men's minds, both in the national aſſembly,
in private ſocieties, and in my paſſage through France to Lauſanne,
where I recalled to my memory the intereſting ſcenes I had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed,
by frequent converſations with my deceaſed friend. I might
have wiſhed to record his opinions on the ſubject of the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
if he had not expreſſed them ſo well in the annexed Letters.
He ſeemed to ſuppoſe, as ſome of his Letters hint, that I had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to the new French opinions. Never indeed, I can with truth
aver, was ſuſpicion more unfounded; nor could it have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Mr. Gibbon's mind, but that his extreme friendſhip for
me, and his utter abhorrence of theſe notions, made him anxious
and jealous, even to an exceſs, that I ſhould not entertain them. He
was, however, ſoon undeceived; he found that I was full as averſe
to them as himſelf. I had from the firſt expreſſed an opinion, that
ſuch a change as was aimed at in France, muſt derange all the regular
governments in Europe, hazard the internal quiet and deareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of this country, and probably end in bringing on mankind
a much greater portion of miſery, than the moſt ſanguine reformer
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0112200701:250"/>
had ever promiſed to himſelf or others to produce of benefit, by the
viſionary ſchemes of liberty and equality, with which the ignorant
and vulgar were miſled and abuſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gibbon at firſt, like many others, ſeemed pleaſed with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the reform of inveterate abuſes; but he very ſoon diſcovered
the miſchief which was intended, the imbecility with which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
were made, and the ruin that muſt ariſe, from the want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
or conduct, in the adminiſtration of France. He lived to
reprobate, in the ſtrongeſt terms poſſible, the folly of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
and the ſomething worſe than extravagance and ferocity of
their ſucceſſors. He ſaw the wild and miſchievous tendency of
thoſe pretended reformers, which, while they profeſſed nothing but
amendment, really meant deſtruction to all ſocial order; and ſo
ſtrongly was his opinion fixed, as to the danger of haſty innovation,
that he became a warm and zealous advocate for every ſort of old
eſtabliſhment, which he marked in various ways, ſometimes rather
ludicrouſly; and I recollect, in a circle where French affairs were
the topic, and ſome Portugueſe preſent, he, ſeemingly with ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
argued in favour of the inquiſition at Liſbon, and ſaid he
would not, at the preſent moment, give up even that old eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</p>
            <p>It may, perhaps, not be quite unintereſting to the readers of theſe
Memoirs, to know, that I found Mr. Gibbon at Lauſanne in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of an excellent houſe; the view from which, and from the
terrace, was ſo uncommonly beautiful, that even his own pen would
with difficulty deſcribe the ſcene which it commanded. This proſpect
comprehended every thing grand and magnificent, which could be
furniſhed by the fineſt mountains among the Alps, the moſt extenſive
view of the Lake of Geneva, with a beautifully varied and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
country, adorned by numerous villas, and pictureſque build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
intermixed with beautiful maſſes of ſtately trees. Here my
friend received us with an hoſpitality and kindneſs which I can never
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0112200701:251"/>
forget. The beſt apartments of the houſe were appropriated to our
uſe; the choiceſt ſociety of the place was ſought for, to enliven our
viſit, and render every day of it cheerful and agreeable. It was
impoſſible for any man to be more eſteemed and admired than Mr.
Gibbon was at Lauſanne. The preference he had given to that
place, in adopting it for a reſidence, rather than his own country,
was felt and acknowledged by all the inhabitants; and he may have
been ſaid almoſt to have given the law to a ſet of as willing ſubjects
as any man ever preſided over. In return for the deference ſhewn
to him, he mixed, without any affectation, in all the ſociety, I
mean all the beſt ſociety, that Lauſanne afforded; he could indeed
command it, and was, perhaps, for that reaſon the more partial to
it; for he often declared that he liked ſociety more as a relaxation
from ſtudy, than as expecting to derive from it amuſement or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
that to books he looked for improvement, not to living
perſons. But this I conſidered partly as an anſwer to my expreſſions
of wonder, that a man who might chooſe the moſt various and
moſt generally improved ſociety in the world, namely, in England,
that he ſhould prefer the very limited circle of Lauſanne, which he
never deſerted, but for an occaſional viſit to M. and Madame Necker.
It muſt not, however, be underſtood, that in chuſing Lauſanne for his
home, he was inſenſible to the merits of a reſidence in England:
he was not in poſſeſſion of an income which correſponded with his
notions of eaſe and comfort in his own country. In Switzerland,
his fortune was ample. To this conſideration of fortune may be
added another, which alſo had its weight; from early youth Mr.
Gibbon had contracted a partiality for foreign taſte and foreign
habits of life, which made him leſs a ſtranger abroad than he
was, in ſome reſpects, in his native country. This aroſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
from having been out of England from his ſixteenth to
his twenty-firſt year; yet, when I came to Lauſanne, I found
him apparently without reliſh for French ſociety. During the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0112200701:252"/>
ſtay I made with him he renewed his intercourſe with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
French who were at Lauſanne; of whom there happened to
be a conſiderable number, diſtinguiſhed for rank or talents; many
indeed reſpectable for both<note n="*" place="bottom">Marſhal de Caſtries and ſeveral branches of his family, Duc de Guignes and daughters, Duc and Ducheſſe de Guiche, Madame de Grammont, Princeſſe d'Henin, Princeſſe de Bouillon, Ducheſſe de Biron, Prince de Salms, Comte de Schomberg, M. Lally Tolendal, M. de Mounier, Madame d'Agueſſeau and family, M. de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbes, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>. During my ſtay in Switzerland I was
not abſent from my friend's houſe, except during a ſhort excurſion
that we made together to Mr. Necker's at Copet, and a tour to Geneva,
Chamouny, over the Col de Balme, to Martigny, St. Maurice, and
round the Lake by Vevay to Lauſanne. In the ſocial and ſingularly
pleaſant months that I paſſed with Mr. Gibbon, he enjoyed his uſual
cheerfulneſs, with good health. Since he left England, in 1788, he
had had a ſevere attack, mentioned in one of the foregoing letters, of
an Eryſipelas, which at laſt ſettled in one of his legs, and left ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a dropſical tendency; for at this time I firſt perceived a
conſiderable degree of ſwelling about the ancle.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of October I left this delightful reſidence; and
ſome time after my return to England, our correſpondence recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced.</p>

very often his miſtreſs, to have the pleaſure of correſponding
with her. Though not abſolutely your lover, I am very much
your admirer, and ſhould be extremely tempted to follow the ſame
example. The ſpirit and reaſon which prevail in your converſation,
appear to great advantage in your letters. The three which I have
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0112200701:254"/>
received from Berne, Coblentz, and Bruſſels have given me much
real pleaſure; firſt, as a proof that you are often thinking of me;
ſecondly, as an evidence that you are capable of keeping a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and thirdly, from their own intrinſic merit and entertainment.
The ſtyle, without any allowance for haſte or hurry, is perfectly
correct; the manner is neither too light, nor too grave; the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
neither too long, nor too ſhort: they are ſuch, in a word, as I
ſhould like to receive from the daughter of my beſt friend. I attend
your lively journal, through bad roads, and worſe inns. Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of men and manners conveys very ſatisfactory information;
and I am particularly delighted with your remark concerning the
irregular behaviour of the Rhine. But the Rhine, alas! after ſome
temporary wanderings, will be content to flow in his old channel,
while man—man is the greateſt fool of the whole creation.</p>
               <p>I direct this letter to Sheffield-Place, where I ſuppoſe you arrived
in health and ſafety. I congratulate my Lady on her quiet eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

this epiſtle reaches you, I hope to have received the two promiſed
letters from Dover and Sheffield-Place. If they ſhould not meet
with a proper return, you will pity and forgive me. I have not yet
heard from Lord Sheffield, who ſeems to have devolved on his

not write to him, till I have received his firſt letter of buſineſs

               <p>I never could underſtand how two perſons of ſuch ſuperior merit,
as Miſs Holroyd and Miſs Lauſanne, could have ſo little reliſh for
one another, as they appeared to have in the beginning; and it was
with great pleaſure that I obſerved the degrees of their growing inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
and the mutual regret of their ſeparation. Whatever you
may imagine, your friends at Lauſanne have been thinking as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0112200701:255"/>
of yourſelf and company, as you could poſſibly think of

may judge moſt agreeable. None of the Severy family, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
my ſecretary, are inclined to forget you; and I am continually
aſked for ſome account of your health, motions, and amuſements.
Since your departure, no great events have occurred. I have made
a ſhort excurſion to Geneva and Copet, and found Mr. Necker in
much better ſpirits than when you ſaw him. They preſſed me to
paſs ſome weeks this winter in their houſe at Geneva; and I may
poſſibly comply, at leaſt, in part, with their invitation. The aſpect of
Lauſanne is peaceful and placid; and you have no hopes of a revolution
driving me out of this country. We hear nothing of the proceedings
of the commiſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">A commiſſion, at the head of which was Monſieur Fiſcher, one of the principal members of the government of Berne, a very active and intelligent man, who would have diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the adminiſtration of any country. This commiſſion, which was accompanied by two or three thouſand of the beſt of the German militia of the Canton of Berne, was ſent for the purpoſe of examining into ſome attempts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the French revolutionary principles into the Pays de Vaud. Several perſons were ſeized; the greater part were releaſed; the examination was ſecret, but Roſſet and La Motte were confined in the caſtle of Chillon; and being afterwards condemned, for correſpondence with the French, to a long impriſonment, were transferred to the caſtle of Arbourg. S.</note>, except by playing at cards every evening with
Monſieur Fiſcher, who often ſpeaks of Lord Sheffield with eſteem
and reſpect. There is no appearance of Roſſet and La Motte being
brought to a ſpeedy trial, and they ſtill remain in the caſtle of
Chillon, which (according to the geography of the National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)
is waſhed by the ſea. Our winter begins with great ſeverity;
and we ſhall not probably have many balls, which, as you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
I lament much. Angletine does not conſider two French
words as a letter. Montrond ſighs and bluſhes whenever Louiſa's
name is mentioned: Philippine wiſhes to converſe with her on men
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0112200701:256"/>
and manners. The French ladies are ſettled in town for the winter,
and they form, with Mrs. Trevor, a very agreeable addition to our
ſociety. It is now enlivened by a viſit of the Chevalier de Boufflers,
one of the moſt accompliſhed men in the <hi>ci devant</hi> kingdom of France.</p>
               <p>As Mrs. Wood<note n="*" place="bottom">Madame de Silva.</note>, who has miſcarried, is about to leave us, I muſt
either cure or die; and, upon the whole, I believe the former will be
moſt expedient. You will ſee her in London, with dear Corea,
next winter. My rival magnificently preſents me with an hogſhead
of Madeira; ſo that in honour I could not ſupplant him: yet I do
aſſure you, from my heart, that another departure is much more
painful to me. The apartment below<note n="†" place="bottom">The apartment principally inhabited during the reſidence of my family at Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne. S.</note> is ſhut up, and I know not
when I ſhall again viſit it with pleaſure. Adieu. Believe me, one and

               <p>ALAS! alas! the daemon of procraſtination has again poſſeſſed me.
Three months have nearly rolled away ſince your departure; and
ſeven letters, five from the moſt valuable Maria, and two from your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
have extorted from me only a ſingle epiſtle, which perhaps
would never have been written, had I not uſed the permiſſion of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
my own tongue and the hand of a ſecretary. Shall I tell you,
that, for theſe laſt ſix weeks, the eve of every day has witneſſed a
<hi>firm</hi> reſolution, and the day itſelf has furniſhed ſome ingenious delay?
This morning, for inſtance, I determined to invade you as ſoon as
the breakfaſt things ſhould be removed: they were removed; but
I had ſomething to read, to write, to meditate, and there was time
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0112200701:257"/>
enough before me. Hour after hour has ſtolen away, and I finally
begin my letter at two o'clock, evidently too late for the poſt, as I
muſt dreſs, dine, go abroad, &amp;c. A foundation, however, <hi>ſhall be</hi> laid,
which will ſtare me in the face; and next Saturday I ſhall probably
be rouſed by the awful reflection that it is the laſt day in the year.</p>
               <p>After realizing this ſummer an event which I had long conſidered
as a dream of fancy, I know not whether I ſhould rejoice or grieve
at your viſit to Lauſanne. While I poſſeſſed the family, the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of pleaſure highly predominated; when, juſt as we had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
in a regular, eaſy, comfortable plan of life, the laſt trump
ſounded, and, without ſpeaking of the pang of ſeparation, you left
me to one of the moſt gloomy, ſolitary months of October which I
have ever paſſed. For yourſelf and daughters, however, you have
contrived to ſnatch ſome of the moſt intereſting ſcenes of this world.
Paris, at ſuch a moment, Switzerland, and the Rhine, Straſburg,
Coblentz, have ſuggeſted a train of lively images and uſeful ideas,
which will not be ſpeedily eraſed. The mind of the young damſel,
more eſpecially, will be enlarged and enlightened in every ſenſe. In
four months ſhe has lived many years; and ſhe will much deceive
and diſpleaſe me, if ſhe does not review and methodize her journal,
in ſuch a manner as ſhe is capable of performing, for the amuſement
of her particular friends. Another benefit which will redound from
your recent view is, that every place, perſon, and object, about
Lauſanne, are now become familiar and intereſting to you. In our
future correſpondence (do I dare pronounce the word correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?)
I can talk to you as freely of every circumſtance as if it
were actually before your eyes. And firſt, of my own improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
—All thoſe venerable piles of ancient verdure which you <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired</hi>
have been eradicated in one fatal day. Your faithful ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
William de Severy and Levade, have never ceaſed to perſecute
me, till I ſigned their death warrant. Their place is now ſupplied
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0112200701:258"/>
by a number of pictureſque naked poles, the foſter-fathers of as
many twigs of Platanuſſes, which may afford a grateful but diſtant
ſhade to the founder, or to his ſeris Nepotibus. In the mean while
I muſt confeſs that the terrace appears broader, and that I diſcover a
much larger quantity of ſnow than I ſhould otherwiſe do. The
workmen admire your ingenious plan for cutting out a new bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
and book-room; but, on mature conſideration, we all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
prefer the old ſcheme of adding a third room on the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race
beyond the library, with two ſpacious windows, and a fire-place
between. It will be larger (28 feet by 21), and pleaſanter, and
warmer: the difference of expence will be much leſs conſiderable
than I imagined: the door of communication with the library will
be artfully buried in the wainſcot; and, unleſs it be opened by my
own choice, may always remain a profound ſecret. Such is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
but, as it will not be executed before next ſummer, you have
time and liberty to ſtate your objections. I am much colder about
the ſtaircaſe, but it may be finiſhed, according to your idea, for
thirty pounds; and I feel they will perſuade me. Am I not a very
rich man? When theſe alterations are completed, few authors of
ſix volumes in quarto will be more agreeably lodged than myſelf.
Lauſanne is now full and lively; all our native families are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from the country; and, praiſed be the Lord! we are infeſted
with few foreigners, either French or Engliſh. Even our demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats
are more reaſonable or more diſcreet; it is agreed, to wave
the ſubject of politics, and all ſeem happy and cordial. I have a
grand dinner this week, a ſupper of thirty or forty people on
Twelfth-day, &amp;c.; ſome concerts have taken place, ſome balls are
talked of; and even Maria would allow (yet it is ungenerous to ſay
even Maria) that the winter ſcene at Lauſanne is tolerably gay and
active. I ſay nothing of the Severys, as Angletine has epiſtolized
Maria laſt poſt. She has probably hinted that her brother meditates a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0112200701:259"/>
ſhort excurſion to Turin: that worthy fellow Trevor has given him
a preſſing invitation to his own houſe. In the beginning of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
I propoſe going to Geneva for three or four weeks. I ſhall lodge
and eat with the Neckers; my mornings will be my own, and I ſhall
ſpend my evenings in the ſociety of the place, where I have many
acquaintance. This ſhort abſence will agitate my ſtagnant life, and
reſtore me with freſh appetite to my houſe, my library, and my
friends. Before that time (the end of February) what events may
happen, or be ready to happen! The National Aſſembly (compared
to which the former was a ſenate of heroes and demi-gods) ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to attack Germany <hi>avec quatre millions de bayonettes libres;</hi> the
army of the princes muſt ſoon either ſight, or ſtarve, or conquer.
Will Sweden draw his ſword? will Ruſſia draw her purſe? an empty
purſe! All is darkneſs and anarchy: neither party is ſtrong enough
to oppoſe a ſettlement; and I cannot ſee a poſſibility of an amicable
arrangement, where there are no heads (in any ſenſe of the word)
who can anſwer for the multitude. Send me your ideas, and thoſe
of Lord Guildford, Lord Loughborough, Fox, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, a word of my vexatious affairs.—Shall I never
ſail on the ſmooth ſtream of good ſecurity and half-yearly intereſt?
will every body refuſe my money? I had already written to Darrel
and Goſling to obey your commands, and was in hopes that you
had already made large and ſalutary evacuations. During your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
I never expected much effect from the cold indifference of
agents; but you are now in England—you will be ſpeedily in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
ſet all your ſetting-dogs to beat the field, hunt, enquire, why
ſhould you not advertiſe? Yet I am almoſt aſhamed to complain of
ſome ſtagnation of intereſt, when I am witneſs to the natural and
acquired philoſophy of ſo many French, who are reduced from
riches, not to indigence, but to abſolute want and beggary. A
Count Argout has juſt left us, who poſſeſſed ten thouſand a-year in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0112200701:260"/>
the iſland of St. Domingo; he is utterly burnt and ruined; and a
brother, whom he tenderly loved, has been murdered by the negroes.
Theſe are real misfortunes. I have much revolved the plan of the
Memoirs I once mentioned; and, as you do not think it ridiculous,
I believe I ſhall make an attempt: if I can pleaſe myſelf, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of not diſpleaſing; but let this be a profound ſecret between
us: people muſt not be prepared to laugh; they muſt be taken by
ſurpriſe. Have you looked over your, or rather my, letters? Surely,
in the courſe of the year, you may find a ſafe and cheap occaſion of
ſending me a parcel; they may aſſiſt me. Adieu. I embrace my
Lady: ſend me a favourable account of her health. I kiſs the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maille.
By an amazing puſh of remorſe and diligence I have

               <p>I NOW moſt ſincerely repent of my late repentance, and do almoſt

Had I delayed, as I was ſtrongly tempted, another poſt,
your miſſive of the 13th, which did not reach me till this morning
(three mails were due), would have arrived in time, and I might
have avoided this ſecond Herculean labour. It will be, however, no
more than an infant Hercules. The topics of converſation have
been fully diſcuſſed, and I ſhall now confine myſelf to the needful of
the new buſineſs. <hi>Felix fauſtumque ſit!</hi> may no untoward accident
diſarrange your Yorkſhire mortgage; the concluſion of which will
place me in a clear and eaſy ſtate, ſuch as I have never known ſince
the firſt hour of property. * * * *</p>

The three per cents are ſo high, and the country is in ſuch a
damned ſtate of proſperity under that fellow Pitt, that it goes againſt
me to purchaſe at ſuch low intereſt. In my viſit to England next
autumn, or in the ſpring following, (alas! you <hi>muſt</hi> acquieſce in
the alternative,) I hope to be armed with ſufficient materials to draw
a ſum, which may be employed as taſte or fancy ſhall dictate, in
the improvement of my library, a ſervice of plate, &amp;c. I am not
very ſanguine, but ſurely this is no uncomfortable proſpect. This
pecuniary detail, which has not indeed been ſo unpleaſant as it uſed
formerly to be, has carried me farther than I expected. Let us now
drink and be merry. I flatter myſelf that your Madeira, improved
by its travels, will ſet forwards for meſſrs. Romberg, at Oſtend, early
in the ſpring; and I ſhould be very well pleaſed if you could add a
hogſhead of excellent Claret, for which we ſhould be entitled to the
drawback: they muſt halt at Baſte, and ſend notice to me for a ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct.
Have you had any intelligence from Lord Auckland about
the wine which he was to order from Bourdeaux, by Marſeilles and
the Rhone? The one need not impede the other; I wiſh to have a
large ſtock. Corea has promiſed me a hogſhead of his native Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira,
for which I am to give him an order on Cadell for a copy of
the Decline and Fall: he vaniſhed without notice, and is now at
Paris. Could you not fiſh out his direction by Mrs. Wood, who by
this time is in England? I rejoice in Lally's proſperity. Have you
reconſidered my propoſal of a declaration of conſtitutional principles
from the heads of the party? I think a fooliſh addreſs from a body
of Whigs to the National Aſſembly renders it ſtill more incumbent
on you. Atchieve my worldly concerns, <hi>et eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>

               <p>FOR fear you ſhould abuſe me, as uſual, I will begin the attack,
and ſcold at you, for not having yet ſent me the long-expected
intelligence of the completion of my mortgage. You had poſitively
aſſured me that the ſecond of February would terminate my worldly
cares, by a conſummation ſo devoutly to be wiſhed. The news,
therefore, might reach me about the eighteenth; and I argued with
the gentle logic of lazineſs, that it was perfectly idle to anſwer your
letter, till I could chaunt a thankſgiving ſong of gratitude and praiſe.
As every poſt diſappointed my hopes, the ſame argument was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
for the next; and twenty empty-handed poſtilions have
blown their inſignificant horns, till I am provoked at laſt to write
by ſheer impatience and vexation. <hi>Facit indignatio verſum. Coſpetto
di Baccho;</hi> for I muſt eaſe myſelf by ſwearing a little. What is
the cauſe, the meaning, the pretence, of this delay? Are the York-ſhire
mortgagers inconſtant in their wiſhes? Are the London lawyers
conſtant in their procraſtination? Is a letter on the road, to inform
me that all is concluded, or to tell me that all is broken to pieces?
Had the money been placed in the three per cents laſt May; beſides
the annual intereſt, it would have gained by the riſe of ſtock nearly
twenty <hi>per cent.</hi> Your Lordſhip is a wiſe man, a ſucceſsful writer,
and an uſeful ſenator; you underſtand America and Ireland, corn
and ſlaves, but your prejudice againſt the funds<note n="*" place="bottom">It would be more correct if he had ſaid, my preference of land. S.</note>, in which I
am often tempted to join, makes you a little blind to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
value in the hands of our virtuous and excellent miniſter.
But our regret is vain; one pull more and we reach the ſhore; and
our future correſpondence will be no longer tainted with buſineſs.
Shall I then be more diligent and regular? I hope and believe ſo;
for now that I have got over this article of worldly intereſt, my letter
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0112200701:263"/>
ſeems to be almoſt finiſhed. <hi>A propos</hi> of letters, am I not a ſad
dog to forget my Lady and Maria? Alas! the dual number has
been prejudicial to both. How happy could I be with either, were
t'other dear charmer away. I am like the aſs of famous memory;
I cannot tell which way to turn firſt, and there I ſtand mute and
immoveable. The Baronial and maternal dignity of my Lady, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by twenty years friendſhip, may claim the preference. But
the ſive incomparable letters of Maria!—Next week, however.—
Am I not aſhamed to talk of next week?</p>
               <p>I have moſt ſucceſsfully, and moſt agreeably, executed my plan of
ſpending the month of March at Geneva, in the Necker-houſe, and
every circumſtance that I had arranged turned out beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation;
the freedom of the morning, the ſociety of the table and
drawing-room, from half an hour paſt two till ſix or ſeven; an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſembly and card-party, in a round of the beſt company, and,
excepting one day in the week, a private ſupper of free and friendly
converſation. You would like Geneva better than Lauſanne; there
is much more information to be got among the men; but though I
found ſome agreeable women, their manners and ſtile of life are,
upon the whole, leſs eaſy and pleaſant than our own. I was much
pleaſed with Necker's brother Mr. De Germain, a good-humoured,
polite, ſenſible man, without the genius and fame of the ſtateſman,
but much more adapted for private and ordinary happineſs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
de Stael is expected in a few weeks at Copet, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her, and where, <q>the pleaſing anxious being,</q> ſhe will
have leiſure to regret <q>to dumb forgetfulneſs a prey,</q> which ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
amidſt the ſtorms of Paris. But what can the poor creature
do? her huſband is in Sweden, her lover is no longer ſecretary at war,
and her father's houſe is the only place where ſhe can reſide with the
leaſt degree of prudence and decency. Of that father I have really a
much higher idea than I ever had before; in our domeſtic intimacy
he caſt away his gloom and reſerve; I ſaw a great deal of his mind,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0112200701:264"/>
and all that I ſaw is fair and worthy. He was overwhelmed by the
hurricane, he miſtook his way in the fog, but in ſuch a perilous
ſituation, I much doubt whether any mortal could have ſeen or
ſtood. In the meanwhile, he is abuſed by all parties, and none of
the French in Geneva will ſet their foot in his houſe. He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
Lord Sheffield with eſteem; his health is good, and he would
be tranquil in his private life, were not his ſpirits continually
wounded by the arrival of every letter and every newſpaper. His
ſympathy is deeply intereſted by the fatal conſequences of a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
in which he had acted ſo leading a part; and he feels as a
friend for the danger of M. de Leſſart, who may be guilty in the
eyes of the Jacobius, or even of his judges, by thoſe very actions
and diſpatches which would be moſt approved by all the lovers of
his country. What a momentous event is the Emperor's death!
In the forms of a new reign, and of the Imperial election, the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats
have at leaſt gained time, if they knew how to uſe it. But the
new monarch, though of a weak complexion, is of a martial temper;
he loves the ſoldiers, and is beloved by them; and the ſlow fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
politics of his uncle may be ſucceeded by a direct line of
march to the gates of Straſbourg and Paris. It is the opinion of the
maſter movers in France, (I know it moſt certainly,) that their troops
will not fight, that the people have loſt all ſenſe of patriotiſm, and
that on the firſt diſcharge of an Auſtrian cannon the game is up.
But what occaſion for Auſtrians or Spaniards? the French are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
their greateſt enemies; four thouſand Marſeillois are marched
againſt Arles and Avignon, the <hi>troupes de ligne</hi> are divided between
the two parties, and the flame of civil war will ſoon extend over the
ſouthern provinces. You have heard of the unworthy treatment
of the Swiſs regiment of Ernſt. The canton of Berne has bravely
recalled them, with a ſtout letter to the King of France, which muſt
be inſerted in all the papers. I now come to the moſt unpleaſant
article, our home politics. Boſſet and La Motte are condemned to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0112200701:265"/>
fine and twenty years impriſonment in the fortreſs of Arbourg. We
have not yet received their official ſentence, nor is it believed that
the proofs and proceedings againſt them will be publiſhed; an auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
circumſtance, which it does not ſeem eaſy to juſtify. Some
(though none of note) are taken up, ſeveral are fled, many more are
ſuſpected and ſuſpicious. All are ſilent, but it is the ſilence of fear
and diſcontent; and the ſecret hatred which rankled againſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
begins to point againſt the few who are known to be well-affected.
I never knew any place ſo much changed as Lauſanne,
even ſince laſt year; and though you will not be much obliged to
me for the motive, I begin very ſeriouſly to think of viſiting Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Place
by the month of September next. Yet here again I am
frightened, by the dangers of a French, and the difficulties of a
German, route. You muſt ſend me an account of the paſſage from
Dieppe to Brighton, with an itinerary of the Rhine, diſtances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
&amp;c. As uſual, I juſt ſave the poſt, nor have I time to read
my letter, which, after waſting the morning in deliberation, has
been ſtruck off in a heat ſince dinner. No news of the Madeira.
Your views of S. P. are juſt received; they are admired, and ſhall be

               <p>AFTER the receipt of your <hi>penultimate,</hi> eight days ago, I expected,
with much impatience, the arrival of your next-promiſed epiſtle.
It arrived this morning, but has not completely anſwered my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.
I wanted, and I hoped for a full and fair picture of the
preſent and probable aſpect of your political world, with which, at
this diſtance, I ſeem every day leſs ſatisfied. In the ſlave queſtion
you triumphed laſt ſeſſion, in this you have been defeated. What
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0112200701:266"/>
is the cauſe of this alteration? If it proceeded only from an impulſe
of humanity, I cannot be diſpleaſed, even with an error; ſince it is
very likely that my own vote (had I poſſeſſed one) would have
been added to the majority. But in this rage againſt ſlavery, in the
numerous petitions againſt the ſlave trade, was there no leaven of
new democratical principles? no wild ideas of the rights and natural
equality of man? It is theſe, I fear. Some articles in newſpapers,
ſome pamphlets of the year, the Jockey Club, have fallen into my
hands. I do not infer much from ſuch publications; yet I have
never known them of ſo black and malignant a caſt. I ſhuddered at
Grey's motion; diſliked the half-ſupport of Fox, admired the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Pitt's declaration, and excuſed the uſual intemperance of Burke.
Surely ſuch men as * * *, * * * *, * * * *, * * * *, * * *, have talents for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
I ſee a club of reform which contains ſome reſpectable names.
Inform me of the profeſſions, the principles, the plans, the reſources, of
theſe reformers. Will they heat the minds of the people? Does the
French democracy gain no ground? Will the bulk of your party ſtand
firm to their own intereſt, and that of their country? Will you not
take ſome active meaſures to declare your ſound opinions, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
yourſelves from your rotten members? If you allow them
to perplex government, if you trifle with this ſolemn buſineſs, if
you do not reſiſt the ſpirit of innovation in the firſt attempt, if you
admit the ſmalleſt and moſt ſpecious change in our parliamentary
ſyſtem, you are loſt. You will be driven from one ſtep to another;
from principles juſt in theory, to conſequences moſt pernicious in
practice; and your firſt conceſſions will be productive of every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
miſchief, for which you will be anſwerable to your country
and to poſterity. Do not ſuffer yourſelves to be lulled into a falſe
ſecurity; remember the proud fabric of the French monarchy. Not
four years ago it ſtood founded, as it might ſeem, on the rock of
time, force, and opinion, ſupported by the triple ariſtocracy of the
church, the nobility, and the parliaments. They are crumbled into
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0112200701:267"/>
duſt; they are vaniſhed from the earth. If this tremendous warning
has no effect on the men of property in England; if it does not
open every eye, and raiſe every arm, you will deſerve your fate.
If I am too precipitate, enlighten; if I am too deſponding, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me.</p>
               <p>My pen has run into this argument; for, as much a foreigner
as you think me, on this momentous ſubject, I feel myſelf an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman.</p>
               <p>The pleaſure of reſiding at Sheffield-Place is, after all, the firſt
and the ultimate object of my viſit to my native country. But when
or how will that viſit be effected? Clouds and whirlwinds, Auſtrian
Croats and Gallic cannibals, ſeem one very ſide to impede my paſſage.
You ſeem to apprehend the perils or dfficulties of the German road,
and French peace is more ſanguinary than civilized war. I muſt
paſs through, perhaps, a thouſand republics or municipalities, which
neither obey nor are obeyed. The ſtrictneſs of paſſports, and the
popular ferment, are much increaſed ſince laſt ſummer: ariſtocrate
is in every mouth, lanterns hang in every ſtreet, and an haſty word,
or a caſual reſemblance, may be fatal. Yet, on the other hand, it
is probable that many Engliſh, men, women, and children, will
traverſe the country without any accident before next September;
and I am ſenſible that many things appear more formidable at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
than on a nearer approach. Without any abſolute determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we muſt ſee what the events of the next three or four months
will produce. In the mean while, I ſhall expect with impatience
your next letter: let it be ſpeedy; my anſwer ſhall be prompt.</p>
               <p>You will be glad, or ſorry, to learn that my gloomy apprehenſions
are much abated, and that my departure, whenever it takes place,
will be an act of choice, rather than of neceſſity. I do not pretend
to affirm, that ſecret diſcontent, dark ſuſpicion, private animoſity,
are very materially aſſuaged; but we have not experienced, nor do
we now apprehend, any dangerous acts of violence, which may
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0112200701:268"/>
compel me to ſeek a refuge among the friendly Bears<note n="*" place="bottom">Berne.</note>, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my library to the mercy of the democrats. The firmneſs and
vigour of government have cruſhed, at leaſt for a time, the ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation;
and I do not believe that the body of the people, eſpecially
the peaſants, are diſpoſed for a revolution. From France, praiſed be
the demon of anarchy! the inſurgents of the Pays de Vaud could
not at preſent have much to hope; and ſhould the <hi>gardes nationales,</hi>
of which there is little appearance, attempt an incurſion, the country
is armed and prepared, and they would be reſiſted with equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and ſuperior diſcipline. The Gallic wolves that prowled round
Geneva are drawn away, ſome to the ſouth and ſome to the north,
and the late events in Flanders ſeem to have diffuſed a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
as well as abhorrence, for the lawleſs ſavages, who fly before
the enemy, hang their priſoners, and murder their officers. The
brave and patient regiment of Erneſt is expected home every day,
and as Berne will take them into preſent pay, that veteran and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
corps will add to the ſecurity of our frontier.</p>
               <p>I rejoice that we have ſo little to ſay on the ſubject of worldly
affairs. * * * * This ſummer we are threatened with an inundation,
beſides many nameleſs Engliſh and Iriſh; but I am anxious for the
Ducheſs of Devonſhire and the Lady Elizabeth Foſter, who are on
their march. Lord Malmſbury, the <hi>audacieux</hi> Harris, will inform
you that he has ſeen me: <hi>him</hi> I would have conſented to keep.</p>
               <p>One word more before we part; call upon Mr. John Nicholls,
bookſeller and printer, at Cicero's Head, Red-Lion-Paſſage, Fleet-Street,
and aſk him whether he did not, about the beginning of
March, receive a very polite letter from Mr. Gibbon of Lauſanne?
To which, either as a man of buſineſs or a civil gentleman, he
ſhould have returned an anſwer. My application related to a
domeſtic article in the Gentleman's Magazine of Auguſt 1788,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0112200701:269"/>
(p. 698,) which had lately fallen into my hands, and concerning
which I requeſted ſome farther lights. Mrs. Moſs delivered the
letters<note n="*" place="bottom">His letters to me for a certain period, which he deſired me to ſend, to aſſiſt him in writing his Memoirs. S.</note> into my hands, but I doubt whether they will be of much
ſervice to me; the work appears far more difficult in the execution
than in the idea, and as I am now taking my leave for ſome time
of the library, I ſhall not make much progreſs in the memoirs of P. P.
till I am on Engliſh ground. But is it indeed true, that I ſhall eat
any Suſſex pheaſants this autumn? The event is in the book of
Fate, and I cannot unroll the leaves of September and October.
Should I reach Sheffield-Place, I hope to find the whole family in a
perfect ſtate of exiſtence, except a certain Maria Holroyd, my fair
and <hi>generous</hi> correſpondent, whoſe annihilation on proper terms I
moſt fervently deſire. I muſt receive a copious anſwer before the
end of next month, June, and again call upon you for a map of
your political world. The chancellor roars; does he break his

               <p>WHEN I inform you, that the deſign of my Engliſh expedition is
at laſt poſtponed till another year, you will not be much ſurpriſed.
The public obſtacles, the danger of one road, and the difficulties of
another, would alone be ſufficient to arreſt ſo unwieldy and inactive a
being; and theſe obſtacles, on the ſide of France, are growing every
day more inſuperable. On the other hand, the terrors which might
have driven me from hence have, in a great meaſure, ſubſided; our
ſtate-priſoners are forgotten: the country begins to recover its old
good humour and unſuſpecting confidence, and the laſt revolution
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0112200701:270"/>
of Paris appears to have convinced almoſt every body of the fatal
conſequences of democratical principles, which lead by a path of
flowers into the abyſs of hell. I may therefore wait with patience
and tranquillity till the Duke of Brunſwick ſhall have opened the
French road. But if I am not driven from Lauſanne, you will aſk,
I hope with ſome indignation, whether I am not drawn to England,
and more eſpecially to Sheffield-Place? The deſire of embracing you
and yours is now the ſtrongeſt, and muſt gradually become the ſole,
inducement that can force me from my library and garden, over
ſeas and mountains. The Engliſh world will forget and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and every year will deprive me of ſome acquaintance, who
by courteſy are ſtyled friends: Lord Guildford and Sir Joſhua Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds!

my laſt date, has the French road been polluted with blood! and
what horrid ſcenes may be acting at this moment, and may ſtill be
aggravated, till the Duke of Brunſwick is maſter of Paris! On every
rational principle of calculation he muſt ſucceed; yet ſometimes,

               <p>AS our Engliſh newſpapers muſt have informed you of the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Savoy by the French, and as it is poſſible that you may
have ſome trifling apprehenſions of my <hi>being killed and eaten by thoſe
cannibals,</hi> it has appeared to me that a ſhort extraordinary diſpatch
might not be unacceptable on this occaſion. It is indeed true, that
about ten days ago the French army of the South, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of M. de Monteſquieu, (if any French army can be ſaid to be
under any command,) has entered Savoy, and poſſeſſed themſelves
of Chamberry, Montmelian, and ſeveral other places. It has always
been the practice of the king of Sardinia to abandon his tranſalpine
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0112200701:272"/>
dominions; but on this occaſion the court of Turin appears to have
been ſurpriſed by the ſtrange excentric motions of a democracy,
which always acts from the paſſion of the moment; and their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
troops have retreated, with ſome loſs and diſgrace, into the paſſes
of the Alps. Mount Cenis is now impervious, and our Engliſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
who are bound for Italy, the Ducheſs of Devonſhire, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,
&amp;c. will be forced to explore a long circuitous road through
the Tirol. But the Chablais is yet intact, nor can our teleſcopes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the tricolor banners on the other ſide of the lake. Our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of the French numbers ſeem to vary from fifteen to thirty
thouſand men; the regulars are few, but they are followed by a
rabble rout, which muſt ſoon, however, melt away, as they will find
no plunder, and ſcanty ſubſiſtence, in the poverty and barrenneſs of
Savoy. <hi>N. B.</hi> I have juſt ſeen a letter from Mr. de Monteſquieu,
who boaſts that at his firſt entrance into Savoy he had only twelve
battalions. Our intelligence is far from correct.</p>
               <p>The magiſtrates of Geneva were alarmed by this dangerous neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
and more eſpecially by the well-known animoſity of an
exiled citizen, Claviere, who is one of the ſix miniſters of the
French republic. It was carried by a ſmall majority in the General
Council, to call in the ſuccour of three thouſand Swiſs, which is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated
by antient treaty. The ſtrongeſt reaſon or pretence of the
minority, was founded on the danger of provoking the French, and
they ſeem to have been juſtified by the event; ſince the complaint
of the French reſident amounts to a declaration of war. The forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Geneva are not contemptible, eſpecially on the ſide of
Savoy; and it is much doubted whether Mr. de Monteſquieu is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for a regular ſiege; but the malecontents are numerous within
the walls, and I queſtion whether the ſpirit of the citizens will hold
out againſt a bombardment. In the mean while the diet has declared
that the firſt cannon fired againſt Geneva will be conſidered as an act
of hoſtility againſt the whole Helvetic body. Berne, as the neareſt
and moſt powerful canton, has taken the lead with great vigour and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0112200701:273"/>
vigilance; the road is filled with the perpetual ſucceſſion of troops
and artillery; and, if ſome diſaffection lurks in the towns, the
peaſants, eſpecially the Germans, are inflamed with a ſtrong deſire
of encountering the murderers of their countrymen. Mr. de Watte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,
with whom you dined at my houſe laſt year, refuſed to accept
the command of the Swiſs ſuccour of Geneva, till it was made his
firſt inſtruction that he ſhould never, in any caſe, ſurrender himſelf
priſoner of war.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, you may ſuppoſe that we have ſome fears. I
have great dependence, however, on the many chances in our
favour, the valour of the Swiſs, the return of the Piedmonteſe with
their Auſtrian allies, eight or ten thouſand men from the Milaneſe,
a diverſion from Spain, the great events (how ſlowly they proceed)
on the ſide of Paris, the inconſtancy and want of diſcipline of the
French, and the near approach of the winter ſeaſon. I am not
nervous, but I will not be raſh. It will be painful to abandon my
houſe and library; but, if the danger ſhould approach, I will retreat
before it, firſt to Berne, and gradually to the North. Should I even
be forced to take refuge in England (a violent meaſure ſo late in the
year), you would perhaps receive me as kindly as you do the French
prieſts—a noble act of hoſpitality! Could I have foreſeen this
ſtorm, I would have been there ſix weeks ago; but who can foreſee
the wild meaſures of the ſavages of Gaul? We thought ourſelves
perfectly out of the hurricane latitudes. Adieu. I am going to bed,
and muſt riſe early to viſit the Neckers at Rolle, whither they have
retired, from the frontier ſituation of Copet. Severy is on horſeback,

               <p>Since my laſt of the 6th, our attack is not more eminent, and our
defence is moſt aſſuredly ſtronger, two very important circumſtances,
at a time when every day is leading us, though not ſo faſt as our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
could wiſh, towards the unwarlike month of November; and
we obſerve with pleaſure that the troops of Mr. de Monteſquieu,
which are chiefly from the Southern Provinces, will not cheerfully
entertain the rigor of an Alpine winter. The 7th inſtant, Mr. de
Chateauneuf, the French reſident, took his leave with an haughty
mandate, commanding the Genevois, as they valued their ſafety and
the friendſhip of the republic, to diſmiſs their Swiſs allies, and to
puniſh the magiſtrates who had traiterouſly propoſed the calling in
theſe foreign troops. It is preciſely the fable of the wolves, who
offered to make peace with the ſheep, provided they would ſend
away their dogs. You know what became of the ſheep. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
appears to have kindled a juſt and general indignation, ſince it
announced an edict of proſcription; and muſt lead to a democratical
revolution, which would probably renew the horrid ſcenes of Paris
and Avignon. A general aſſembly of the citizens was convened, the
meſſage was read, ſpeeches were made, oaths were taken, and it was
reſolved (with only three diſſentient voices) to live and die in the
defence of their country. The Genevois muſter above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
well-armed citizens; and the Swiſs, who may eaſily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
(in a few hours) to an equal number, add ſpirit to the timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0112200701:275"/>
and confidence to the well-affected: their arſenals are filled
with arms, their magazines with ammunition, and their granaries
with corn. But their fortifications are extenſive and imperfect, they
are commanded from two adjacent hills; a French faction lurks in
the city, the character of the Genevois is rather commercial than
military, and their behaviour, lofty promiſe, and baſe ſurrender, in
the year 1782, is freſh in our memories. In the mean while, 4000
French at the moſt are arrived in the neighbouring camp, nor is
there yet any appearance of mortars or heavy artillery. Perhaps
an haughty menace may be repelled by a firm countenance. If it
were worth while talking of juſtice, what a ſhameful attack of a
feeble, unoffending ſtate! On the news of their danger, all Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,
from Schaſſouſe to the Pays de Vaud, has riſen in arms;
and a French reſident, who has paſſed through the country, in his
way from Ratiſbon, declares his intention of informing and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the National Convention. About eleven thouſand Bernois
are already poſted in the neighbourhood of Copet and Nyon; and
new reinforcements of men, artillery, &amp;c. arrive every day. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
army is drawn together to oppoſe Mr. de Ferrieres, on the ſide
of Bienne and the biſhopric of Baſle; and the Auſtrians in Swabia
would be eaſily perſuaded to croſs the Rhine in our defence. But
we are yet ignorant whether our ſovereigns mean to wage an
offenſive or defenſive war. If the latter, which is more likely, will
the French begin the attack? Should Genoa yield to fear or force,
this country is open to an invaſion; and though our men are brave,
we want generals; and I deſpiſe the French much leſs than I did two
months ago. It ſhould ſeem that our hopes from the King of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia
and the Auſtrians of Milan are faint and diſtant; Spain ſleeps;
and the Duke of Brunſwick (amazement!) ſeems to have failed in his
great project. For my part, till Geneva falls, I do not think of a
retreat; but, at all events, I am provided with two ſtrong horſes, and
an hundred Louis in gold. Zurich would be probably my winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0112200701:276"/>
and the ſociety of the Neckers would make any place agreeable.

Mr. de Monteſquieu and three commiſſioners of the Convention,

               <p>My uſual temper very readily admitted the excuſe, that it would
be better to wait another week, till the final ſettlement of our affairs.
The treaty is ſigned between France and Geneva; and the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Convention is looked upon as aſſured, if any thing can be
aſſured in that wild democracy. On condition that the Swiſs garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
with the approbation of Berne and Zurich, be recalled before
the firſt of December, it is ſtipulated that the independence of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva
ſhall be preſerved inviolate; that Mr. de Monteſquieu ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſend away his heavy artillery; and that no French troops
ſhall approach within ten leagues of the city. As the Swiſs have
acted only as auxiliaries, they have no occaſion for a direct treaty; but
they cannot prudently diſarm, till they are ſatisfied of the pacific
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0112200701:277"/>
intentions of France; and no ſuch ſatisfaction can be given till they
have acknowledged the new republic, which they will probably do
in a few days, with a deep groan of indignation and ſorrow; it has
been cemented with the blood of their countrymen! But when the
Emperour, the King of Pruſſia, the firſt general, and the firſt army
in Europe have failed, leſs powerful ſtates may acquieſce, without
diſhonour, in the determination of fortune. Do you underſtand this
moſt unexpected failure? I will allow an ample ſhare to the badneſs
of the roads and the weather, to famine and diſeaſe, to the ſkill of
Dumourier, a heaven-born general! and to the enthuſiaſtic ardour
of the new Romans; but ſtill, ſtill there muſt be ſome ſecret and
ſhameful cauſe at the bottom of this ſtrange retreat. We are now
delivered from the impending terrors of ſiege and invaſion. The
Geneva <hi>emigrés,</hi> particularly the Neckers, are haſtening to their
homes; and I ſhall not be reduced to the hard neceſſity of ſeeking a
winter aſylum at Zurich or Conſtance: but I am not pleaſed with
our future proſpects. It is much to be feared that the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Geneva will be ſoon modelled after the French faſhion; the
new republic of Savoy is forming on the oppoſite bank of the Lake;
the Jacobin miſſionaries are powerful and zealous; and the malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of this country, who begin again to rear their heads, will be
ſurrounded with temptations, and examples, and allies. I know not
whether the Pays de Vaud will long adhere to the dominion of
Berne; or whether I ſhall be permitted to end my days in this little

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0112200701:278"/>
his genealogical communications, which I am impatient to receive;
but I do not underſtand why ſo civil a gentleman could not favour
me, in ſix months, with an anſwer by the poſt: ſince he entruſts me
with theſe valuable papers, you have not, I preſume, informed him
of my negligence and awkwardneſs in regard to manuſcripts. Your
reproach rather ſurpriſes me, as I ſuppoſe I am much the ſame as I
have been for theſe laſt twenty years. Should you hold your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of writing only ſuch things as may be publiſhed at Charing-Croſs,
our future correſpondence would not be very intereſting. But
I expect and require, at this important criſis, a full and confidential
account of your views concerning England, Ireland, and France.
You have a ſtrong and clear eye; and your pen is, perhaps, the moſt
uſeful quill that ever has been plucked from a gooſe. Your protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the French reſugees is highly applauded. Roſſet and La
Motte have eſcaped from Arbourg, perhaps with connivance to avoid
diſagreeable demands from the republic. Adieu. Ever yours.</p>

               <p>RECEIVED this day, November 9th, a moſt amiable diſpatch
from the too humble ſecretary<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs Holroyd.</note> of the family of Eſpee<note n="†" place="bottom">Meaning Sheffield-Place.</note>, dated
October 24th, which I anſwer the ſame day. It will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that I have fulfilled my engagements with as much accuracy
as our uncertain ſtate and the fragility of human nature would allow.
I reſume my narrative. At the time when we imagined that all was
ſettled, by an equal treaty between two ſuch unequal powers, as the
Geneva Flea and the Leviathan France, we were thunderſtruck with
the intelligence that the miniſters of the republic refuſed to ratify the
conditions; and they were indignant, with ſome colour of reaſon, at
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0112200701:279"/>
the hard obligation of withdrawing their troops to the diſtance of
ten leagues, and of conſequently leaving the Pays de Gez naked,
and expoſed to the Swiſs, who had aſſembled 15,000 men on the
frontier, and with whom they had not made any agreement. The
meſſenger who was ſent laſt Sunday from Geneva is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
and many perſons are afraid of ſome deſign and danger in
this delay. Monteſquieu has acted with politeneſs, moderation, and
apparent ſincerity; but he may reſign, he may be ſuperſeded, his
place may be occupied by an <hi>enragé,</hi> by Servan, or Prince Charles
of Heſſe, who would aſpire to imitate the predatory fame of Cuſtine
in Germany. In the mean while, the General holds a wolf by the
ears; an officer who has ſeen his troops, about 18,000 men (with a
tremendous train of artillery), repreſents them as a black, daring, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
crew of buccaneers, rather ſhocking than contemptible; the
officers (ſcarcely a gentleman among them), without ſervants, or
horſes, or baggage, lying <hi>higgledy piggledy</hi> on the ground with the
common men, yet maintaining a rough kind of diſcipline over them.
They already begin to accuſe and even to ſuſpect their general, and
call aloud for blood and plunder: could they have an opportunity of
ſqueezing ſome of the rich citizens, Geneva would cut up as ſat as
moſt towns in Europe. During this ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities they are
permitted to viſit the city without arms, ſometimes three or four
hundred at a time; and the magiſtrates, as well as the Swiſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
are by no means pleaſed with this dangerous intercourſe,
which they dare not prohibit. Such are our fears: yet it ſhould ſeem
on the other ſide, that the French affect a kind of magnanimous juſtice
towards their little neighbour, and that they are not ambitious of an
unprofitable conteſt with the poor and hardy Swiſs. The Swiſs are
not equal to a long and expenſive war; and as moſt of our militia
have families and trades, the country already ſighs for their return.
Whatever can be yielded, without abſolute danger or diſgrace, will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0112200701:280"/>
doubtleſs be granted; and the buſineſs will probably end in our owning
the ſovereignty, and truſting to the good faith of the republic of France:
how that word would have ſounded four years ago! The meaſure
is humiliating; but after the retreat of the Duke of Brunſwick, and
the failure of the Auſtrians, the ſmaller powers may acquieſce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſhonour. Every dog has his day; and theſe Gallic dogs have
their day, at leaſt, of moſt inſolent proſperity. After forcing or
tempting the Pruſſians to evacuate their country, they conquer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
pillage Germany, threaten Spain: the Low Countries are ere
now invaded; Rome and Italy tremble; they ſcour the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean,
and talk of ſending a ſquadron into the South Sea. The whole
horizon is ſo black, that I begin to feel ſome anxiety for England,
the laſt refuge of liberty and law; and the more ſo, as I perceive
from Lord Sheffield's laſt epiſtle that his firm nerves are a little ſhaken:
but of this more in my next, for I want to unburthen my conſcience.
If England, with the experience of our happineſs and French calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſhould now be ſeduced to eat the apple of falſe freedom, we
ſhould indeed deſerve to be driven from the paradiſe which we
enjoy. I turn aſide from the horrid and improbable (yet not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
ſuppoſition, that, in three or four years' time, myſelf and my
beſt friends may be reduced to the deplorable ſtate of the French
emigrants: they thought it as impoſſible three or four years ago.
Never did a revolution affect, to ſuch a degree, the private exiſtence
of ſuch numbers of the firſt people of a great country: your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of miſery I could eaſily match with ſimilar examples in this
country and the neighbourhood; and our ſympathy is the deeper,
as we do not poſſeſs, like you, the means of alleviating, in ſome
degree, the misfortunes of the fugitives. But I muſt have, from the
very excellent pen of the Maria, the tragedy of the Archbiſhop of
Arles; and the longer the better. Madame de Biron has probably
been tempted by ſome faint and (I fear) fallacious promiſes of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0112200701:281"/>
to the women, and which have likewiſe engaged Madame
d'Agueſſeau and her two daughters to reviſit France. Madame de
Bouillon ſtands her ground, and her ſituation as a foreign princeſs is
leſs expoſed. As Lord S. has aſſumed the glorious character of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of the diſtreſſed, his name is pronounced with gratitude and
reſpect. The D. of Richmond is praiſed, on Madame de Biron's
account. To the Princeſs d'Henin, and Lally, I wiſh to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.
The Neckers cannot venture into Geneva, and Madame de
Stael will probably lie in at Rolle. He is printing a defence of the
King, &amp;c. againſt their republican Judges; but the name of Necker
is unpopular to all parties, and I much fear that the guillotine will
be more ſpeedy than the preſs. It will, however, be an eloquent
performance; and, if I find an opportunity, I am to ſend you one,
to you Lord S. by his particular deſire: he wiſhes likewiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
ſome copies with ſpeed to our principal people, Pitt, Fox, Lord
Stormont, &amp;c. But ſuch is the rapid ſucceſſion of events, that it
will appear like the <hi>Pouvoir Executif,</hi> his beſt work, after the whole
ſcene has been totally changed. Ever yours.</p>

                  <p>The revolution of France, and my triple diſpatch by the

ſingular events in the eighteenth century. I found the taſk ſo
eaſy and pleaſant, that I had ſome thoughts of adding a letter

               <p>IN diſpatching the weekly political journal to Lord S. my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(for I have ſome remains of conſcience) moſt powerfully
urges me to ſalute, with ſome lines of friendſhip and gratitude, the
amiable ſecretary, who might ſave herſelf the trouble of a modeſt
apology. I have not yet forgotten our different behaviour after the
much lamented <hi>ſeparation</hi> of October the 4th, 1791, your meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
punctuality, and my unworthy ſilence. I have ſtill before me
that entertaining narrative, which would have intereſted me, not only
in the progreſs of the <hi>cariſſima familia,</hi> but in the motions of a
Tartar camp, or the march of a caravan of Arabs; the mixture of
juſt obſervation and lively imagery, the ſtrong ſenſe of a man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with the eaſy elegance of a female. I ſtill recollect with
pleaſure the happy compariſon of the Rhine, who had heard ſo much
of liberty on both his banks, that he wandered with miſchievous
licentiouſneſs over all the adjacent meadows<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Gibbon alludes to letters written to him by Miſs Holroyd, when ſhe was returning from Switzerland, along the Rhine, to England. S.</note>. The inundation,
alas! has now ſpread much wider; and it is ſadly to be feared that
the Elbe, the Po, and the Danube, may imitate the vile example of
the Rhine: I ſhall be content, however, if our own Thames ſtill
preſerves his fair character, of</p>
               <q>Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.</q>
               <p>Theſe agreeable epiſtles of Maria produced only ſome dumb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and ſome barren remorſe; nor have I deſigned, except by
a brief miſſive from my chancellor, to expreſs how much I loved
the author, and how much I was pleaſed with the compoſition.
That amiable author I have known and loved from the firſt dawning
of her life and <hi>coquetry,</hi> to the preſent maturity of her talents; and as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0112200701:283"/>
long as I remain on this planet, I ſhall purſue, with the ſame tender
and even anxious concern, the future ſteps of her eſtabliſhment and
life. That eſtabliſhment muſt be ſplendid; that life muſt be happy.
She is endowed with every gift of nature and fortune; but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which ſhe will derive from them, depends almoſt entirely on
herſelf. You muſt not, you ſhall not, think yourſelf unworthy to
write to any man: there is none whom your correſpondence would
not amuſe and ſatisfy. I will not undertake a taſk, which my taſte
would adopt, and my indolence would too ſoon relinquiſh; but I
am really curious, from the beſt motives, to have a particular account
of your own ſtudies and daily occupation. What books do you read?
and how do you employ your time and your pen? Except ſome
profeſſed ſcholars, I have often obſerved that women in general read
much more than men; but, for want of a plan, a method, a fixed
object, their reading is of little benefit to themſelves, or others. If
you will inform me of the ſpecies of reading to which you have the
moſt propenſity, I ſhall be happy to contribute my ſhare of advice or
aſſiſtance. I lament that you have not left me ſome monument of
your pencil. Lady Elizabeth Foſter has executed a very pretty
drawing, taken from the door of the green-houſe where we dined
laſt ſummer, and including the poor Acacia (now recovered from the
cruel ſheers of the gardener), the end of the terrace, the front of the
Pavilion, and a diſtant view of the country, lake, and mountains. I
am almoſt reconciled to d'Apples' houſe, which is nearly finiſhed.
Inſtead of the monſters which Lord Hercules Sheffield extirpated,
the terrace is already ſhaded with the new acacias and plantanes; and
although the uncertainty of poſſeſſion reſtrains me from building, I
myſelf have planted a boſquet at the bottom of the garden, with ſuch
admirable ſkill that it affords ſhade without intercepting proſpect.
The ſociety of the aforeſaid Eliza, commonly called Beſs, of the
Ducheſs of D. &amp;c. has been very intereſting; but they are now flown
beyond the Alps, and paſs the winter at Piſa. The Legards, who
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0112200701:284"/>
have long ſince left this place, ſhould be at preſent in Italy; but I
believe Mrs. Grimſtone and her daughter returned to England. The

retain ſome attachment to this delightful country, and it is indeed
delightful, why ſhould you deſpair of ſeeing it once more? The

Lauſanne, and from Lauſanne to Rome and Naples. Before that
this event takes place, I may poſſibly ſee you in Suſſex; and,
whether as a viſitor or a fugitive, I hope to be welcomed with a
friendly embrace. The delay of this year was truly painful, but it
was inevitable; and individuals muſt ſubmit to thoſe ſtorms which

The natives of the coaſt were endeavouring to get from them what they had not, (viz.) money, when a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the neighbourhood came to their protection; and, finding they had nothing, ſhewed his good ſenſe, by diſpatching them to Milord Sheffield: they had been pillaged, and with great difficulty had eſcaped from Paris. The reception they met with at this houſe, ſeemed to make the greateſt impreſſion on them; they were in extacy on finding M. de Lally living: they gradually became cheerful, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their dinner: they were greatly affected as they recollected themſelves, and found us attending on them. Having dined, and drank a glaſs of wine, they began to diſcover the beauties of the dining-room, and of the chateau: as they walked about, they were overheard to expreſs their admiration at the treatment they met, and <hi>from Proteſtants.</hi> We then aſſembled in the library, formed half a circle round the fire, M. de Lally and Milord occupying the hearth <hi>à l'Angloiſe,</hi> and queſtioning the prieſts concerning their eſcape. Thus we diſcovered, that two of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate men were in the Carmelite Convent at the time of the maſſacre of the one hundred and twenty prieſts, and had moſt miraculouſly eſcaped, by climbing trees in the garden, and from thence over the tops of the buildings. One of them, a man of ſuperior appearance, deſcribed, in the moſt pathetic manner, the death of the Archbiſhop of Arles, (and with ſuch ſimplicity and feeling, as to leave no doubt of the truth of all that he ſaid,) to the following purport.—On the ſecond of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, about five o'clock in the evening, at the time they were permitted to walk in the garden, expecting every hour to be releaſed, they expreſſed their ſurpriſe at ſeeing ſeveral large pits, which had been digging for two days paſt: they ſaid, the day is almoſt ſpent; and yet Manuel told a perſon who interceded for us laſt Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that on the Sunday following not one ſhould remain in captivity: we are ſtill priſoners: ſoon after, they heard ſhouts, and ſome muſquet-ſhots. An enſign of the national guard, ſome commiſſaries of the ſections, and ſome Marſeillois ruſhed in: the miſerable victims, who were diſperſed in the garden, aſſembled under the walls of the church, not daring to go in, leſt it ſhould be polluted with blood. One man, who was behind the reſt, was ſhot. "<hi>Point de coup de fuſils,</hi>" cried one of the chiefs of the aſſaſſins, thinking that kind of death too eaſy. Theſe well-trained fuſileers went to the rear; les piques, les haches, les poignards came forward. They demanded the Archbiſhop of Arles; he was immediately ſurrounded by all the prieſts. The worthy prelate ſaid to his friends, <q>Let me paſs; if my blood will appeaſe them, what ſignifies it, if I die? Is it not my duty to preſerve your lives at the expence of my own?</q> He aſked the eldeſt of the prieſts to give him abſolution: he knelt to receive it; and when he aroſe, forced himſelf from them, advanced ſlowly, and with his arms croſſed upon his breaſt, and his eyes raiſed to heaven, ſaid to the aſſaſſins, "<hi>Je ſuis celui que vous cherchez.</hi>" His appearance was ſo dignified and noble, that, during ten minutes, not one of theſe wretches had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to lift his hand againſt him: they upbraided each other with cowardice, and advanced; one look from this venerable man ſtruck them with awe, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. At laſt, one of the miſcreants ſtruck off the cap of the Archbiſhop with a pike; reſpect once violated, their fury returned, and another from behind cut him through the ſkull with a ſabre. He raiſed his right hand to his eyes; with another ſtroke they cut off his hand. The Archbiſhop ſaid, <hi>O! mon Dieu!</hi> and raiſed the other: a third ſtroke acroſs the face left him ſitting; the fourth extended him life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on the ground; and then all preſſed forward, and buried their pikes and poignards in the body. The prieſts all agreed, that he had been one of the moſt amiable men in France; and that his only <hi>crime</hi> was, having, ſince the revolution, expended his private fortune, to ſupport the neceſſitous clergy of his dioceſe. The ſecond victim was the General des Benedictins. Then the national guards obliged the prieſts to go into the church, telling them, they ſhould appear, one after another, before the Commiſſaires du ſection. They had hardly entered, before the people impatiently called for them; upon which, all kneeling before the altar, the Biſhop of Beauvais gave them abſolution: they were then obliged to go out, two by two; they paſſed before a commiſſaire, who did not queſtion, but only counted, his victims; they had in their ſight the heaps of dead, to which they were going to add. Among the one hundred and twenty prieſts thus ſacrificed, were the Biſhops of Zaintes and Beauvais (both of the Rochefoucauld family). I ſhould not omit to remark, that one of the prieſts obſerved they were aſſaſſinated, becauſe they would not ſwear to a conſtitution which their murderers had deſtroyed. We had (to comfort us for this melancholy ſtory) the moſt grateful expreſſions of gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Engliſh nation, from whom they did not do us the juſtice to expect ſuch a reception.</p>
                           <p>There can be no doubt that the whole buſineſs of the maſſacres was concerted at a meeting at the Duke of Orleans's houſe. I ſhall make you as diſmal as myſelf by this narration. I muſt change the ſtyle. * * * * * * * * * *</p>

the hiſtorian may be careleſs, he may be indolent, he may always
intend and never execute, but he is neither a monſter nor a ſtatue;
he has a memory, a conſcience, a heart, and that heart is ſincerely

a ſophiſm which he has ſometimes uſed, and ſhe has always and

united, the writing to one is in fact writing to all; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
all his numerous letters to the huſband, may be conſidered
as equally addreſſed to his wife. He feels, on the contrary, that
ſeparate minds have their diſtinct ideas and ſentiments, and that
each character, either in ſpeaking or writing, has its peculiar tone
of converſation. He agrees with the maxim of Rouſſeau, that
three friends who wiſh to diſcloſe a common ſecret, will impart it
only <hi>deux à deux;</hi> and he is ſatisfied that, on the preſent memorable
occaſion, each of the perſons of the Sheffield family will claim a
peculiar ſhare in this triple miſſive, which will communicate, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
a triple ſatisfaction. The experience of what may be effected

I lament, on all our accounts, that the laſt year's expedition to
Lauſanne did not take place in a golden period, of health and ſpirits.
But we muſt reflect, that human felicity is ſeldom without alloy;
and if we cannot indulge the hope of your making a ſecond viſit to
Lauſanne, we muſt look forwards to my reſidence next ſummer at
Sheffield-Place, where I muſt find you in the full bloom of health,
ſpirits, and beauty. I can perceive, by all public and private intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that your houſe has been the open hoſpitable aſylum of
French fugitives; and it is a ſufficient proof of the firmneſs of your
nerves, that you have not been overwhelmed or agitated by ſuch a
concourſe of ſtrangers. Curioſity and compaſſion may, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
have ſupported you. Every day has preſented to your view
ſome new ſcene of that ſtrange tragical romance, which occupies all
Europe ſo infinitely beyond any event that has happened in our
time, and you have the ſatisfaction of not being a mere ſpectator of
the diſtreſs of ſo many victims of falſe liberty. The benevolent
fame of Lord S. is widely diffuſed.</p>
               <p>From Angletine's laſt letter to Maria, you have already ſome idea
of the melancholy ſtate of her poor father. As long as Mr. de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
allowed our hopes and fears to fluctuate with the changes of
his diſorder, I was unwilling to ſay any thing on ſo painful a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and it is with the deepeſt concern that I now confeſs our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
deſpair of his recovery. All his particular complaints are now
loſt in a general diſſolution of the whole frame; every principle
of life is exhauſted, and as often as I am admitted to his bed-ſide,
though he ſtill looks and ſmiles with the patience of an angel, I
have the heart-felt grief of ſeeing him each day drawing nearer to
the term of his exiſtence. A few weeks, poſſibly a few days, will
deprive me of a moſt excellent friend, and break for ever the
moſt perfect ſyſtem of domeſtic happineſs, in which I had ſo large
and intimate a ſhare. Wilhelm (who has obtained leave of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0112200701:289"/>
from his military duty) and his ſiſter behave and feel like
tender and dutiful children; but they have a long gay proſpect of
life, and new connections, new families will make them forget, in
due time, the common lot of mortality. But it is Madame de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whom I truly pity; I dread the effects of the firſt ſhock, and I
dread ſtill more the deep perpetual conſuming affliction for a loſs
which can never be retrieved. You will not wonder that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
ſadden my own mind, nor can I forget how much my ſituation
is altered ſince I retired, nine years ago, to the banks of the Leman
Lake. The death of poor Deyverdun firſt deprived me of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
companion, who can never be ſupplied; and your viſit has
only ſerved to remind me that man, however amuſed and occupied
in his cloſet, was not made to live alone. Severy will ſoon be no
more; his widow for a long time, perhaps for ever, will be loſt to
herſelf and her friends, the ſon will travel, and I ſhall be left a
ſtranger in the inſipid circle of mere common acquaintance. The
revolution of France, which firſt embittered and divided the ſociety of
Lauſanne, has oppoſed a barrier to my Suſſex viſit, and may finally
expel me from the paradiſe which I inhabit. Even that paradiſe,
the expenſive and delightful eſtabliſhment of my houſe, library, and
garden, almoſt becomes an incumbrance, by rendering it more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
for me to relinquiſh my hold, or to form a new ſyſtem of life
in my native country, for which my income, though improved and
improving, would be probably inſufficient. But every complaint
ſhould be ſilenced by the contemplation of the French; compared
with whoſe cruel fate, all miſery is relative happineſs. I perfectly
concur in your partiality for Lally; though Nature might forget
ſome meaner ingredients, of prudence, oeconomy, &amp;c. ſhe never
formed a purer heart, or a brighter imagination. If he be with you,
I beg my kindeſt ſalutations to him. I am every day more cloſely
united with the Neckers. Should France break, and this country
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0112200701:290"/>
be over-run, they would be reduced, in very humble circumſtances,
to ſeek a refuge; and where but in England? Adieu, dear Madam,
there is, indeed, much pleaſure in diſcharging one's heart to a real
friend. Ever yours.</p>

               <p>AFTER the triple labour of my laſt diſpatch, your experience of
the creature might tempt you to ſuſpect that it would again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
into a long ſlumber. But, partly from the ſpirit of contradiction,
(though I am not a lady,) and partly from the eaſe and pleaſure which
I now find in the taſk, you ſee me again alive, awake, and almoſt
faithful to my hebdomadal promiſe. The laſt week has not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
afforded any events deſerving the notice of an hiſtorian. Our
affairs are ſtill floating on the waves of the convention, and the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a corrected treaty, which had been fixed for the twentieth,
is not yet arrived; but the report of the diplomatic committee has
been favourable, and it is generally underſtood that the leaders of
the French republic do not wiſh to quarrel with the Swiſs. We are
gradually withdrawing and diſbanding our militia. Geneva will be
left to ſink or ſwim, according to the humour of the people; and our
laſt hope appears to be, that by ſubmiſſion and good behaviour we
ſhall avert for ſome time the impending ſtorm. A few days ago an
odd accident happened in the French army; the defertion of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
As the Neckers were ſitting, about eight o'clock in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in their drawing-room at Rolle<note n="*" place="bottom">A conſiderable town between Lauſanne and Geneva.</note>, the door flew open, and they
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0112200701:291"/>
were aſtounded by their ſervant's announcing <hi>Monſieur le General
de Monteſquieu?</hi> On the receipt of ſome ſecret intelligence of a
<hi>decret d'accuſation,</hi> and an order to arreſt him, he had only time to
get on horſeback, to gallop through Geneva, to take boat for Copet,
and to eſcape from his purſuers, who were ordered to ſeize him alive
or dead. He left the Neckers after ſupper, paſſed through Lauſanne
in the night, and proceeded to Berne and Baſle, whence he intended
to wind his way through Germany, amidſt enemies of every deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to ſeek a refuge in England, America, or the moon. He
told Necker, that the ſole remnant of his fortune conſiſted in a
wretched ſum of twenty thouſand livres; but the public report, or
ſuſpicion, beſpeaks him in much better circumſtances. Beſides the
reproach of acting with too much tameneſs and delay, he is accuſed
of making very foul and exorbitant contracts; and it is certain that
new Sparta is infected with this vice, beyond the example of the
moſt corrupt monarchy. Kellerman is arrived, to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and it is apprehended that on the firſt of December, after the
departure of the Swiſs, the French may <hi>requeſt</hi> the permiſſion of
uſing Geneva, a friendly city, for their winter quarters. In that
caſe, the democratical revolution, which we all foreſee, will be very
ſpeedily effected.</p>
               <p>I would aſk you, whether you apprehend there was any treaſon in
the Duke of Brunſwick's retreat, and whether you have totally
withdrawn your confidence and eſteem from that once-famed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral?
Will it be poſſible for England to preſerve her neutrality
with any honour or ſafety? We are bound, as I underſtand, by
treaty, to guarantee the dominions of the King of Sardinia and the
Auſtrian provinces of the Netherlands. Theſe countries are now
invaded and over-run by the French. Can we refuſe to fulfil our
engagements, without expoſing ourſelves to all Europe as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
or puſillanimous nation? Yet, on the other hand, can we
aſſiſt thoſe allies, without plunging headlong into an abyſs, whoſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0112200701:292"/>
bottom no man can diſcover? But my chief anxiety is for our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
tranquillity; for I muſt find a retreat in England, ſhould I
be driven from Lauſanne. The idea of firm and honourable union
of parties pleaſes me much; but you muſt frankly unfold what are the
great difficulties that may impede ſo ſalutary a meaſure: you write to
a man diſcreet in ſpeech, and now careful of papers. Yet what can
ſuch a coalition avail? Where is the champion of the conſtitution?
Alas, Lord Guildford! I am much pleaſed with the Mancheſter
Aſs. The aſſes or wolves who ſacrificed him have caſt off the maſk too
ſoon; and ſuch a nonſenſical act muſt open the eyes of many ſimple
patriots, who might have been led aſtray by the ſpecious name of
reform. It ſhould be made as notorious as poſſible. Next winter may
be the criſis of our fate, and if you begin to improve the conſtitution,
you may be driven ſtep by ſtep from the disfranchiſement of old
Sarum to the King in Newgate, the Lords voted uſeleſs, the Biſhops
aboliſhed, and a Houſe of Commons without articles (<hi>ſans cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottes</hi>). Necker has ordered you a copy of his royal defence, which
has met with, and deſerved, univerſal ſucceſs. The pathetic and
argumentative parts are, in my opinion, equally good, and his mild
eloquence may perſuade without irritating. I have applied to this
gentler tone ſome verſes of Ovid, (Metamorph. l. iii. 302, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>WITH the return of peace I have relapſed into my former indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
but now awakening, after a fortnight's ſlumber, I have little
or nothing to add, with regard to the internal ſtate of this country,
only the revolution of Geneva has already taken place, as I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
but ſooner than I expected. The Swiſs troops had no
ſooner evacuated the place, than the <hi>Egaliſeurs,</hi> as they are called,
aſſembled in arms; and as no reſiſtance was made, no blood was
ſhed on the occaſion. They ſeized the gates, diſarmed the garriſon,
impriſoned the magiſtrates, imparted the rights of citizens to all the
rabble of the town and country, and proclaimed a <hi>National</hi> Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0112200701:294"/>
which has not yet met. They are all for a pure and abſolute
democracy; but ſome wiſh to remain a ſmall independent ſtate,
whilſt others aſpire to become a part of the republic of France; and
as the latter, though leſs numerous, are more violent and abſurd
than their adverſaries, it is highly probable that they will ſucceed.
The citizens of the beſt families and fortunes have retired from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva
into the Pays de Vaud; but the French methods of recalling
or proſcribing emigrants, will ſoon be adopted. You muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that Savoy is now become <hi>le department du Mont Blanc.</hi> I
cannot ſatisfy myſelf, whether the maſs of the people is pleaſed or
diſpleaſed with the change; but my noble ſcenery is clouded by
the democratical aſpect of twelve leagues of the oppoſite coaſt, which
every morning obtrude themſelves on my view. I here conclude the
firſt part of the hiſtory of our Alpine troubles, and now conſider
myſelf as diſengaged from all promiſes of periodical writing. Upon
the whole, I kept it beyond our expectation; nor do I think that
you have been ſufficiently aſtoniſhed by the wonderful effort of the
triple diſpatch.</p>
               <p>You muſt now ſucceed to my taſk, and I ſhall expect, during
the winter, a regular political journal of the events of your greater
world. You are on the theatre, and may often be behind the ſcenes.
You can always ſee, and may ſometimes foreſee. My own choice has
indeed tranſported me into a foreign land; but I am truly attached,
from intereſt and inclination, to my native country; and even as a
citizen of the world, I wiſh the ſtability of England, the ſole great
refuge of mankind, againſt the oppoſite miſchiefs of deſpotiſm and
democracy. I was indeed alarmed, and the more ſo, as I ſaw that
you were not without apprehenſion; but I now glory in the triumph
of reaſon and genuine patriotiſm, which ſeems to pervade the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
nor do I diſlike ſome mixture of popular enthuſiaſm, which
may be requiſite to encounter our mad or wicked enemies with equal

You have now cruſhed the daring ſubverters of the conſtitution;
but I now fear the moderate well-meaners, reformers. Do not, I
beſeech you, tamper with parliamentary repreſentation. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
houſe of commons forms, in <hi>practice,</hi> a body of gentlemen, who
muſt always ſympathize with the intereſts and opinions of the people;
and the ſlighteſt innovation launches you, without rudder or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
on a dark and dangerous ocean of theoretical experiment. On
this ſubject I am indeed ſerious.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, I like the beginning of ninety-three better than
the end of ninety-two. The illuſion ſeems to break away through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Europe. I think England and Switzerland are ſafe. Brabant
adheres to its old conſtitution. The Germans are diſguſted with the
rapine and inſolence of their deliverers. The Pope is reſolved
to head his armies, and the Lazzaroni of Naples have preſented
St. Januarius with a gold fuzee, to fire on the Brigands François.
So much for politics, which till now never had ſuch poſſeſſion of
my mind. Next poſt I will write about myſelf and my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.

               <p>THERE was formerly a time when our correſpondence was a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diſcuſſion of my private affairs; a vexatious repetition of
loſſes, of diſappointments, of ſales, &amp;c. Theſe affairs are decently
arranged: but public cares have now ſucceeded to private anxiety,
and our whole attention is lately turned from Lenborough and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton,
to the political ſtate of France and of Europe. From theſe
politics, however, one letter ſhall be free, while I talk of myſelf and
of my own plans; a ſubject moſt intereſting to a friend, and only
to a friend.</p>
               <p>I know not whether I am ſorry or glad that my expedition has
been poſtponed to the preſent year. It is true, that I now wiſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in England, and almoſt repent that I did not graſp the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
when the obſtacles were comparatively ſmaller than they are now
likely to prove. Yet had I reached you laſt ſummer before the
month of Auguſt, a conſiderable portion of my time would be now
elapſed, and I ſhould already begin to think of my departure. If
the gout ſhould ſpare me this winter, (and as yet I have not felt any
ſymptom,) and if the ſpring ſhould make a ſoft and early appearance,
it is my intention to be with you in Downing-ſtreet before the end
of April, and thus to enjoy ſix weeks or two months of the moſt
agreeable ſeaſon of London and the neighbourhood, after the hurry
of parliament is ſubſided, and before the great rural diſperſion. As
the banks of the Rhine and the Belgic provinces are completely
overſpread with anarchy and war, I have made up my mind to paſs
through the territories of the French republic. From the beſt and
moſt recent information, I am ſatisfied that there is little or no real
danger in the journey; and I muſt arm myſelf with patience to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0112200701:297"/>
the vexatious inſolence of democratical tyranny. I have even
a ſort of curioſity to ſpend ſome days at Paris, to aſſiſt at the debates
of the Pandaemonium, to ſeek an introduction to the principal devils,
and to contemplate a new form of public and private life, which
never exiſted before, and which I devoutly hope will not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to exiſt. Should the obſtacles of health or weather confine
me at Lauſanne till the month of May, I ſhall ſcarcely be able to
reſiſt the temptation of paſſing ſome part at leaſt of the ſummer in
my own little paradiſe. But all theſe ſchemes muſt ultimately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the great queſtion of peace and war, which will indeed be
ſpeedily determined. Should France become impervious to an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
traveller, what muſt I do? I ſhall not eaſily reſolve to explore
my way through the unknown language and abominable roads of
the interior parts of Germany, to embark in Holland, or perhaps at
Hamburgh, and to be finally intercepted by a French privateer. My
ſtay in England appears not leſs doubtful than the means of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
myſelf. Should I arrive in the ſpring, it is poſſible, and
barely poſſible, that I ſhould return here in the autumn: it is much
more probable that I ſhall paſs the winter, and there may be even a
chance of my giving my own country a longer trial. In my letter
to my Lady I fairly expoſed the decline of Lauſanne; but ſuch an
eſtabliſhment as mine muſt not be lightly abandoned; nor can I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what adequate mode of life my private circumſtances, eaſy as
they now are, could afford me in England. London and Bath have
doubtleſs their reſpective merits, and I could wiſh to reſide within a
day's journey of Sheffield-Place. But a ſtate of perfect happineſs is
not to be found here below; and in the poſſeſſion of my library,
houſe, and garden, with the relicks of our ſociety, and a frequent
intercourſe with the Neckers, I may ſtill be tolerably content.
Among the diſaſtrous changes of Lauſanne, I muſt principally
reckon the approaching diſſolution of poor Severy and his family.
He is ſtill alive, but in ſuch a hopeleſs and painful decay, that we
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0112200701:298"/>
no longer conceal our wiſhes for his ſpeedy releaſe. I never loved
nor eſteemed him ſo much as in this laſt mortal diſeaſe, which he
ſupports with a degree of energy, patience, and even cheerfulneſs,
beyond all belief. His wife, whoſe whole time and ſoul are devoted
to him, is almoſt ſinking under her long anxiety. The children are
moſt amiably aſſiduous to both their parents, and, at all events, his
filial duties and worldly cares muſt detain the ſon ſome time at
home.</p>
               <p>And now approach, and let me drop into your moſt private ear
a literary ſecret. Of the Memoirs little has been done, and with
that little I am not ſatisfied. They muſt be poſtponed till a mature
ſeaſon; and I much doubt whether the book and the Author can
ever ſee the light at the ſame time. But I have long revolved in my
mind another ſcheme of biographical writing: the Lives, or rather
the Characters, of the moſt eminent Perſons in Arts and Arms, in
Church and State, who have flouriſhed in Britain from the reign of
Henry the Eighth to the preſent age. This work, extenſive as it may
be, would be an amuſement, rather than a toil: the materials are
acceſſible in our own language, and, for the moſt part, ready to my
hands: but the ſubject, which would afford a rich diſplay of human
nature and domeſtic hiſtory, would powerfully addreſs itſelf to the
feelings of every Engliſhman. The taſte or faſhion of the times
ſeems to delight in pictureſque decorations; and this ſeries of Britiſh
portraits might aptly be accompanied by the reſpective heads, taken
from originals, and engraved by the beſt maſters. Alderman Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,
and his ſon-in-law, Mr. George Nicol, bookſeller in Pall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
are the great undertakers in this line. On my arrival in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
I ſhall be free to conſider, whether it may ſuit me to proceed
in a mere literary work without any other decorations than thoſe
which it may derive from the pen of the Author. It is a ſerious
truth, that I am no longer ambitious of fame or money; that my
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0112200701:299"/>
habits of induſtry are much impaired, and that I have reduced my
ſtudies, to be the looſe amuſement of my morning hours, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of which will inſenſibly lead me to the laſt term of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And for this very reaſon I ſhall not be ſorry to bind my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by a liberal engagement, from which I may not with honour
recede.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, we muſt ſay a word or two of parliamentary
and pecuniary concerns. 1. We all admire the generous ſpirit with
which you damned the aſſaſſins * *. I hope that * * * * *
The opinion of parliament in favour of Louis was declared in a
manner worthy of the repreſentatives of a great and a wiſe nation.
It will certainly have a powerful effect; and if the poor King be not
already murdered, I am ſatisfied that his life is in ſafety: but in ſuch a
life worth his care? Our debates will now become every day more
intereſting; and as I expect from you only opinions and anecdotes,
I moſt earneſtly conjure you to ſend me Woodfall's Regiſter as often
(and that muſt be very often) as the occaſion deſerves it. I now
ſpare no expence for news.</p>
               <p>I want ſome account of Mrs. G.'s health. Will my Lady
never write? How can people be ſo indolent! I ſuppoſe this will
find you at Sheffield-Place during the receſs, and that the heavy
baggage will not move till after the birth-day. Shall I be with you

               <p>THE ſtruggle is at length over, and poor de Severy is no more!
He expired about ten days ago, after every vital principle had
been exhauſted by a complication of diſorders, which had laſted
above five months: and a mortification in one of his legs, that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
roſe to the more noble parts, was the immediate cauſe of his
death. His patience and even cheerfulneſs ſupported him to the
fatal moment; and he enjoyed every comfort that could alleviate his
ſituation, the ſkill of his phyſicians, the aſſiduous tenderneſs of his
family, and the kind ſympathy not only of his particular friends,
but even of common acquaintance, and generally of the whole town.
The ſtroke has been ſeverely felt: yet I have the ſatisfaction to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Madame de Severy's health is not affected; and we may
hope that in time ſhe will recover a tolerable ſhare of compoſure and
happineſs. Her firmneſs has checked the violent ſallies of grief;
her gentleneſs has preſerved her from the worſt of ſymptoms, a dry,
ſilent deſpair. She loves to talk of her irreparable loſs, ſhe deſcants
with pleaſure on his virtues; her words are interrupted with tears,
but thoſe tears are her beſt relief; and her tender feelings will inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſubſide into an affectionate remembrance. Wilhelm is much
more deeply wounded than I could imagine, or than he expected
himſelf: nor have I ever ſeen the affliction of a ſon more lively and
ſincere. Severy was indeed a very valuable man: without any
ſhining qualifications, he was endowed in a high degree with good
ſenſe, honour, and benevolence; and few men have filled with more
propriety their circle in private life. For myſelf, I have had the
misfortune of knowing him too late, and of loſing him too ſoon.—
But enough of this melancholy ſubject.</p>

The affairs of this theatre, which muſt always be minute, are now
grown ſo tame and tranquil, that they no longer deſerve the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian's
pen. The new conſtitution of Geneva is ſlowly forming,
without much noiſe or any bloodſhed; and the patriots, who have
ſtaid in hopes of guiding and reſtraining the multitude, flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that they ſhall be able at leaſt to prevent their mad countrymen
from giving themſelves to the French, the only miſchief that would
be abſolutely irretrievable. The revolution of Geneva is of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to us, however, than that of Savoy; but our fate will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the general event, rather than on theſe particular cauſes.
In the mean while we hope to be quiet ſpectators of the ſtruggle of
this year; and we ſeem to have aſſurances that both the Emperor and
the French will compound for the neutrality of the Swiſs. The Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetic
body does not acknowledge the republic of France; but Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelemy,
their ambaſſador, reſides at Baden, and ſteals, like Chauve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
into a kind of extra-official negotiation. All ſpirit of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is quelled in the Canton of Berne, and the perpetual baniſhment
of the ****** family has ſcarcely excited a murmur. It will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be followed by that of ****** *****: the crime alleged in
their ſentence is the having aſſiſted at the federation-dinner at Rolle
two years ago; and as they are abſent, I could almoſt wiſh that they
had been ſummoned to appear, and heard in their own defence. To
the general ſupineneſs of the inhabitants of Lauſanne I muſt aſcribe,
that the death of Louis the Sixteenth has been received with leſs
horror and indignation than I could have wiſhed. I was much
tempted to go into mourning, and probably ſhould, had the Ducheſs
been ſtill here; but, as the only Engliſhman of any mark, I was
afraid of being ſingular; more eſpecially as our French emigrants,
either from prudence or poverty, do not wear black, nor do even
the Neckers. Have you read his diſcourſe for the King? It might
indeed ſuperſede the neceſſity of mourning. I ſhould judge from
your laſt letter, and from the Diary, that the French declaration of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0112200701:302"/>
war muſt have rather ſurpriſed you. I wiſh, although I know not
how it could have been avoided, that we might ſtill have continued
to enjoy our ſafe and proſperous neutrality. You will not doubt
my beſt wiſhes for the deſtruction of the miſcreants; but I love
England ſtill more than I hate France. All reaſonable chances are
in favour of a confederacy, ſuch as was never oppoſed to the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Louis the Fourteenth; but, after the experience of laſt year,
I diſtruſt reaſon, and confeſs myſelf fearful for the event. The
French are ſtrong in numbers, activity, enthuſiaſm; they are rich in
rapine; and, although their ſtrength may be only that of a phrenzy
fever, they may do infinite miſchief to their neighbours before they
can be reduced to a ſtrait waiſtcoat. I dread the effects that may be
produced on the minds of the people by the increaſe of debt and
taxes, probable loſſes, and poſſible miſmanagement. Our trade muſt
ſuffer; and though projects of invaſion have been always abortive, I
cannot forget that the fleets and armies of Europe have failed before
the towns in America, which have been taken and plundered by a
handful of Buccaneers. I know nothing of Pitt as a war miniſter;
but it affords me much ſatisfaction that the intrepid wiſdom of the
new chancellor<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Loughborough.</note> is introduced into the cabinet. I wiſh, not merely
on your own account, that you were placed in an active, uſeful
ſtation in government. I ſhould not diſlike you ſecretary at war.</p>
               <p>I have little more to ſay of myſelf, or of my journey to England:
you know my intentions, and the great events of Europe muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether they can be carried into execution this ſummer. If
***** has warmly adopted <hi>your</hi> idea, I ſhall ſpeedily hear from him;
but, in truth, I know not what will be my anſwer: I ſee difficulties
which at firſt did not occur: I doubt my own perſeverance, and my
fancy begins to wander into new paths. The amuſement of reading
and thinking may perhaps ſatisfy a man who has paid his debt to the
public; and there is more pleaſure in building caſtles in the air than
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0112200701:303"/>
on the ground. I ſhall contrive ſome ſmall aſſiſtance for your eorre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent,
though I cannot learn any thing that diſtinguiſhes him
from many of his countrymen; we have had our full ſhare of poor
emigrants: but if you wiſh that any thing extraordinary ſhould be
done for this man, you muſt ſend me a meaſure. Adieu. I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

               <p>MY deareſt Friend, for ſuch you moſt truly are, nor does there
exiſt a perſon who obtains, or ſhall ever obtain, a ſuperior
place in my eſteem and affection.</p>
               <p>After too long a ſilence I was ſitting down to write, when, only
yeſterday morning (ſuch is now the irregular ſlowneſs of the Engliſh
poſt), I was ſuddenly ſtruck, indeed ſtruck to the heart, by the fatal
intelligence<note n="*" place="bottom">The death of Lady Sheffield.</note> from Sir Henry Clinton and Mr. de Lally. Alas! what
is life, and what are our hopes and projects! When I embraced her
at your deparure from Lauſanne, could I imagine that it was for
the laſt time? when I poſtponed to another ſummer my journey
to England, could I apprehend that I never, never ſhould ſee her
again? I always hoped that ſhe would ſpin her feeble thread
to a long duration, and that her delicate frame would ſurvive
(as is often the caſe) many conſtitutions of a ſtouter appearance.
In four days! in your abſence, in that of her children! But ſhe
is now at reſt; and if there be a future life, her mild virtues
have ſurely entitled her to the reward of pure and perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
It is for you that I feel, and I can judge of your ſentiments
by comparing them with my own. I have loſt, it is true, an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and affectionate friend, whom I had known and loved above
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0112200701:304"/>
three-and-twenty years, and whom I often ſtyled by the endearing
name of ſiſter. But you are deprived of the companion of your life,
the wife of your choice, and the mother of your children; poor
children! the livelineſs of Maria, and the ſoftneſs of Louiſa, render
them almoſt equally the objects of my tendereſt compaſſion. I do not
wiſh to aggravate your grief; but, in the ſincerity of friendſhip, I
cannot hold a different language. I know the impotence of reaſon,
and I much fear that the ſtrength of your character will ſerve to
make a ſharper and more laſting impreſſion.</p>
               <p>The only conſolation in theſe melancholy trials to which human
life is expoſed, the only one at leaſt in which I have any confidence,
is the preſence of a real friend; and of that, as far as it depends on
myſelf, you ſhall not be deſtitute. I regret the few days that muſt
be loſt in ſome neceſſary preparations; but I truſt that to-morrow
ſe'nnight (May the fifth) I ſhall be able to ſet forwards on my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to England; and when this letter reaches you, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
advanced on my way. As it is yet prudent to keep at a
reſpectful diſtance from the banks of the French Rhine, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
a little to the right, and proceed by Schaffouſe and Stutgard to
Frankfort and Cologne: the Auſtrian Netherlands are now open and
ſafe, and I am ſure of being able at leaſt to paſs from Oſtend to
Dover; whence, without paſſing through London, I ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
the direct road to Sheffield-Place. Unleſs I ſhould meet with
ſome unforeſeen accidents and delays, I hope, before the end of the
month to ſhare your ſolitude, and ſympathize with your grief. All
the difficulties of the journey, which my indolence had probably
magnified, have now diſappeared before a ſtronger paſſion; and you
will not be ſorry to hear, that, as far as Frankfort to Cologne, I ſhall
enjoy the advantage of the ſociety, the converſation, the German
language, and the active aſſiſtance of Severy. His attachment to me
is the ſole motive which prompts him to undertake this troubleſome
journey; and as ſoon as he has ſeen me over the rougheſt ground,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0112200701:305"/>
he will immediately return to Lauſanne. The poor young man
loved Lady S. as a mother, and the whole family is deeply affected
by an event which reminds them too painfully of their own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Adieu. I could write volumes, and ſhall therefore break off
abruptly. I ſhall write on the road, and hope to find a few lines
<hi>à poſte reſtante</hi> at Frankfort and Bruſſels. Adieu; ever yours.</p>

               <p>I MUST write a few lines before my departure, though indeed I
ſcarcely know what to ſay. Nearly a fortnight has now elapſed
ſince the firſt melancholy tidings, without my having received the
ſlighteſt ſubſequent accounts of your health and ſituation. Your
own ſilence announces too forcibly how much you are involved in
your feelings; and I can but too eaſily conceive that a letter to me
would be more painful than to an indifferent perſon. But that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man Count Lally might ſurely have written a ſecond time; but
your ſiſter, who is probably with you; but Maria,—alas! poor Maria!
I am left in a ſtate of darkneſs to the workings of my own fancy,
which imagines every thing that is ſad and ſhocking. What can I
think of for your relief and comfort? I will not expatiate on thoſe
common-place topics, which have never dried a ſingle tear; but let
me adviſe, let me urge you to force yourſelf into buſineſs, as I would
try to force myſelf into ſtudy. The mind muſt not be idle; if it
be not exerciſed on external objects, it will prey on its own vitals.
A thouſand little arrangements, which muſt precede a long journey,
have poſtponed my departure three or four days beyond the term
which I had firſt appointed; but all is now in order, and I ſet off
to-morrow, the ninth inſtant, with my <hi>valet de chambre,</hi> a courier
on horſeback, and Severy, with his ſervant, as far as Frankfort. I
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0112200701:306"/>
calculate my arrival at Sheffield-Place (how I dread and deſire to ſee
that manſion!) for the firſt week in June, ſoon after this letter; but
I will try to ſend you ſome later intelligence. I never found myſelf
ſtronger, or in better health. The German road is now cleared,
both of enemies and allies, and though I muſt expect fatigue, I
have not any apprehenſions of danger. It is ſcarcely poſſible
that you ſhould meet me at Frankfort, but I ſhall be much diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
at not finding a line at Bruſſels or Oſtend. Adieu. If there
be any inviſible guardians, may they watch over you and yours!

of a war. Yet I hear, as I am writing, the cannon of the
ſiege of Mayence, at the diſtance of twenty miles; and long, very
long, will it be heard. It is confeſſed on all ſides, that the French
fight with a courage worthy of a better cauſe. The town of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is ſtrong, their artillery admirable; they are already reduced

to extended to Paris and the whole country, it might eſſentially

            <p>THE preceding Letters intimate that, in return for my viſit to
Lauſanne in 1791, Mr. Gibbon engaged to paſs a year with
me in England; that the war having rendered travelling exceedingly
inconvenient, eſpecially to a perſon who, from his bodily infirmities,
required every accommodation, prevented his undertaking ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
a journey at the time he propoſed.</p>
            <p>The call of friendſhip, however, was ſufficient to make him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
every perſonal conſideration, when he thought his preſence
might prove a conſolation. I muſt ever regard it as the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
proof of his ſenſibility, and of his poſſeſſing the true ſpirit
of friendſhip, that after having relinquiſhed the thought of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
viſit, he haſtened to England, in ſpite of encreaſing impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to ſoothe me by the moſt generous ſympathy, and to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
my domeſtic affliction; neither his great corpulency, nor his
extraordinary bodily infirmities, nor any other conſideration, could
prevent him a moment from reſolving on an undertaking that might
have deterred the moſt active young man. He, almoſt immediately,
with alertneſs by no means natural to him, undertook a great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitous
journey, along the frontiers of an enemy, worſe than ſavage,
within the found of their cannon, within the range of the light
troops of the different armies, and through roads ruined by the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
machinery of war.</p>
            <p>The readineſs with which he engaged in this kind office of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
at a time when a ſelfiſh ſpirit might have pleaded a thouſand
reaſons for declining ſo hazardous a journey, conſpired, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0112200701:309"/>
charms of his ſociety to render his arrival a cordial to my
mind. I had the ſatisfaction of finding that his own delicate and
precarious health had not ſuffered in the ſervice of his friend, a
ſervice in which he diſregarded his own perſonal infirmities. He
arrived in the beginning of June at my houſe in Downing-Street,
ſafe and in good health; and after we had paſſed about a month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in London, we ſettled at Sheffield-Place for the ſummer;
where his wit, learning, and cheerful politeneſs delighted a great
variety of characters.</p>
            <p>Although he was inclined to repreſent his health as better than it
really was, his habitual diſlike to motion appeared to increaſe; his
inaptneſs to exerciſe confined him to the library and dining-room,
and there he joined my friend Mr. Frederick North, in pleaſant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
againſt exerciſe in general. He ridiculed the unſettled and
reſtleſs diſpoſition that ſummer, the moſt uncomfortable, as he ſaid,
of all ſeaſons, generally gives to thoſe who have the free uſe of their
limbs. Such arguments were little required to keep ſociety within
doors, when his company was only there to be enjoyed; for neither
the fineneſs of the ſeaſon, nor the moſt promiſing parties of pleaſure,
could tempt the company of either ſex to deſert him.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have enjoyed the ſociety of Mr. Gibbon will agree
with me, that his converſation was ſtill more captivating than his
writings. Perhaps no man ever divided time more fairly between
literary labour and ſocial enjoyment; and hence, probably, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
his peculiar excellence of making his very extenſive knowledge
contribute, in the higheſt degree, to the uſe or pleaſure of thoſe with
whom he converſed. He united, in the happieſt manner imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
two characters which are not often found in the ſame perſon,
the profound ſcholar and the faſcinating companion.</p>
            <p>It would be ſuperſtuous to attempt a very minute delineation of a
character which is ſo diſtinctly marked in the Memoirs and Letters.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0112200701:310"/>
He has deſcribed himſelf without reſerve, and with perfect ſincerity.
The Letters, and eſpecially the extracts from the Journal, which could
not have been written with any purpoſe of being ſeen, will make the
reader perfectly acquainted with the man.</p>
            <p>Excepting a viſit to Lord Egremont and Mr. Hayley, whom he
very particularly eſteemed, Mr. Gibbon was not abſent from Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Place
till the beginning of October, when we were reluctantly
obliged to part with him, that he might perform his engagement to
Mrs. Gibbon at Bath, the widow of his father, who had early de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and invariably retained, his affection. From Bath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Lord Spenſer's at Althorp, a family which he always met
with uncommon ſatisfaction. He continued in good health during
the whole ſummer, and in excellent ſpirits (I never knew him enjoy
better); and when he went from Sheffield-Place, little did I imagine
it would be the laſt time I ſhould have the inexpreſſible pleaſure of
ſeeing him there in full poſſeſſion of health.</p>

               <p>I AM as ignorant of Bath in general as if I were ſtill at Sheffield.
My impatience to get away makes me think it better to devote
my whole time to Mrs. G.; and dear little aunt, whom I tenderly
ſalute, will excuſe me to her two friends, Mrs. Hartley and Preſton,
if I make little or no uſe of her kind introduction. A <hi>tête-à-têete</hi>
of eight or nine hours every day is rather difficult to ſupport; yet I
do aſſure you, that our converſation flows with more eaſe and ſpirit
when we are alone, than when any auxiliaries are ſummoned to our
aid. She is indeed a wonderful woman, and I think all her faculties
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0112200701:313"/>
of the mind ſtronger, and more active, than I have ever known them.
I have ſettled, that ten full days may be ſufficient for all the purpoſes
of our interview. I ſhould therefore depart next Friday, the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
inſtant, and am indeed expected at Althorpe on the twentieth;
but I may poſſibly reckon without my hoſt, as I have not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
Mrs. G. of the term of my viſit; and will certainly not
quarrel with her for a ſhort delay. Adieu. I muſt have ſome poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ſpeculations. The campaign, at leaſt on our ſide, ſeems to be at

Yeſterday I ſent for Farquhar, who is allowed to be a very
ſkilful ſurgeon. After viewing and palping, he very ſeriouſly deſired
to call in aſſiſtance, and has examined it again to-day with Mr. Cline,
a ſurgeon, as he ſays, of the firſt eminence. They both pronounce
it a <hi>hydrocele,</hi> (a collection of water,) which muſt be let out by the
operation of tapping; but, from its magnitude and long neglect,
they think it a moſt extraordinary caſe, and wiſh to have another

I ſhall be delivered from my burthen, (it is almoſt as big as a ſmall

IMMEDIATELY on receiving the laſt letter, I went the ſame day
from Brighthelmſtone to London, and was agreeably ſurpriſed to
find that Mr. Gibbon had dined at Lord Lucan's, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his lodgings, where I waited for him, till eleven o'clock at
night. Thoſe who have ſeen him within the laſt eight or ten
years, muſt be ſurpriſed to hear, that he could doubt, whether
his diſorder was apparent. When he returned to England in
1787, I was greatly alarmed by a prodigious increaſe, which I
always conceived to proceed from a rupture. I did not underſtand
why he, who had talked with me on every other ſubject relative to
himſelf and his affairs without reſerve, ſhould never in any ſhape
hint at a malady ſo troubleſome; but on ſpeaking to his valet de
chambre, he told me, Mr. Gibbon could not bear the leaſt alluſion
to that ſubject, and never would ſuffer him to notice it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
ſome medical perſons, who with me ſuppoſing it to be a
rupture, were of opinion that nothing could be done, and ſaid that
he ſurely muſt have had advice, and of courſe had taken all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
precautions. He now talked freely with me about his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
which, he ſaid, began in the year 1761; that he then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
Mr. Hawkins the ſurgeon, who did not decide whether it was
the beginning of a rupture, or an hydrocele; but he deſired to ſee
Mr. Gibbon again when he came to town. Mr. Gibbon not feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any pain, nor ſuffering any inconvenience, as he ſaid, never
returned to Mr. Hawkins; and although the diſorder continued to
increaſe gradually, and of late years very much indeed, he never
mentioned it to any perſon, however incredible it may appear, from
1761 to November 1793. I told him, that I had always ſuppoſed
there was no doubt of its being a rupture; his anſwer was, that he
never thought ſo, and that he, and the ſurgeons who attended him,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0112200701:317"/>
were of opinion that it was an hydrocele. It is now certain that
it was originally a rupture, and that an hydrocele had lately taken
place in the ſame part; and it is remarkable, that his legs, which had
been ſwelled about the ankle, particularly one of them, ſince he
had the eriſipelas in 1790, recovered their former ſhape as ſoon as
the water appeared in another part, which did not happen till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the time he left Sheffield-Place, in the beginning of October,
and his arrival at Althorpe, towards the latter end of that month.
On the Thurſday following the date of his laſt letter, Mr. Gibbon
was tapped for the firſt time; four quarts of a tranſparent watery
fluid were diſcharged by that operation. Neither inflammation nor
fever enſued; the tumour was diminiſhed to nearly half its ſize; the
remaining part was a ſoft irregular maſs. I had been with him two
days before, and I continued with him above a week after the firſt
tapping, during which time he enjoyed his uſual ſpirits; and the
three medical gentlemen who attended him will recollect his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry,
even during the operation. He was abroad again in a few
days, but the water evidently collecting very faſt, it was agreed that
a ſecond puncture ſhould be made a fortnight after the firſt. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I ſhould be wanted at a meeting in the country, he preſſed
me to attend it, and promiſed that ſoon after the ſecond operation
was performed he would follow me to Sheffield-Place; but before
he arrived I received the two following Letters:</p>

Mr. Gibbon generally took the opportunity of paſſing a night
or two with his friend Lord Auckland, at Eden-Farm, (ten miles
from London,) on his paſſage to Sheffield-Place; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his indiſpoſition, he had lately made an excurſion thither
from London; when he was much pleaſed by meeting the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of Canterbury, of whom he expreſſed an high opinion. He
returned to London, to dine with Lord Loughborough, to meet
Mr. Burke, Mr. Windham, and particularly Mr. Pitt, with whom
he was not acquainted; and in his laſt journey to Suſſex, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſited
Eden-Farm, and was much gratified by the opportunity of
again ſeeing, during a whole day, Mr. Pitt, who paſſed the night
there. From Lord Auckland's, Mr. Gibbon proceeded to Sheffield-Place;
and his diſcourſe was never more brilliant, nor more entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than on his arrival. The parallels he drew, and the compariſons
he made, between the leading men of this country, were ſketched
in his beſt manner, and were infinitely intereſting. However, this
laſt viſit to Sheffield-Place became far different from any he had ever
made before. That ready, cheerful, various, and illuminating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
which we had before admired in him, was not now always
to be found in the library or the dining-room. He moved with
difficulty, and retired from company ſooner than he had been uſed
to do. On the twenty-third of December, his appetite began to fail
him. He obſerved to me, that it was a very bad ſign <hi>with him</hi>
when he could not eat his breakfaſt, which he had done at all times
very heartily; and this ſeems to have been the ſtrongeſt expreſſion
of apprehenſion that the was ever obſerved to utter. A conſiderable
degree of fever now made its appearance. Inflammation aroſe, from
the weight and the bulk of the tumour. Water again collected very
faſt, and when the ſever went off, he never entirely recovered his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0112200701:320"/>
even for breakfaſt. I became very uneaſy indeed at his ſituation
towards the end of the month, and thought it neceſſary to adviſe him
to ſet out for London. He had before ſettled his plan to arrive
there about the middle of January. I had company in the houſe,
and we expected one of his particular friends; but he was obliged
to ſacrifice all ſocial pleaſure to the immediate attention which his
health required. He went to London on the ſeventh of January,
and the next day I received the following billet; the laſt he ever
wrote:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="letter">
               <head>EDWARD GIBBON Eſq. to Lord SHEFFIELD.</head>

               </opener>
               <p>THIS date ſays every thing. I was almoſt killed between Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Place
and Eaſt-Grinſted, by hard, frozen, long, and croſs
ruts, that would diſgrace the approach of an Indian wig-wam.
The reſt was ſomething leſs painful; and I reached this place half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dead,
but not ſeriouſly feveriſh, or ill. I found a dinner invitation
from Lord Lucan; but what are dinners to me? I wiſh they did
not know of my departure. I catch the flying poſt. What
an effort! Adieu, till Thurſday or Friday.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="editorial_note">
               <p>By his own deſire, I did not follow him till Thurſday the ninth.
I then found him far from well. The tumour more diſtended than
before, inflamed, and ulcerated in ſeveral places. Remedies were
applied to abate the inflammation; but it was not thought proper to
puncture the tumour for the third time, till Monday the 13th of
January, when no leſs than ſix quarts of fluid were diſcharged. He
ſeemed much relieved by the evacuation. His ſpirits continued
good. He talked, as uſual, of paſſing his time at houſes which he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0112200701:321"/>
had often frequented with great pleaſure, the Duke of Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire's,
Mr. Craufurd's, Lord Spenſer's, Lord Lucan's, Sir Ralph
Payne's, and Mr. Batt's; and when I told him that I ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the country, as I had intended, he preſſed me to go; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I had an engagement there on public buſineſs, he ſaid, <q>you
may be back on Saturday, and I intend to go on Thurſday to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire-Houſe.</q>
I had not any apprehenſion that his life was
in danger, although I began to fear that he might not be reſtored to
a comfortable ſtate, and that motion would be very troubleſome to
him; but he talked of a radical cure. He ſaid, that it was fortunate
the diſorder had ſhewn itſelf while he was in England, where he might
procure the beſt aſſiſtance; and if a radical cure could not be obtained
before his return to Lauſanne, there was an able ſurgeon at Geneva,
who could come to tap him when it ſhould be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday the fourteenth, when the riſk of inflammation and
fever from the laſt operation was ſuppoſed to be over, as the medical
gentlemen who attended him expreſſed no fears for his life, I went
that afternoon part of the way to Suſſex, and the following day
reached Sheffield-Place. The next morning, the ſixteenth, I received
by the poſt a good account of Mr. Gibbon, which mentioned alſo
that he hourly gained ſtrength. In the evening came a letter by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
dated noon that day, which acquainted me that Mr. Gibbon
had had a violent attack the preceding night, and that it was not
probable he ſhould live till I could come to him. I reached his
lodgings in St. James's-ſtreet about midnight, and learned that my
friend had expired a quarter before one o'clock that day, the ſixteenth
of January 1794.</p>
               <p>After I left him on Tueſday afternoon the fourteenth, he ſaw ſome
company, Lady Lucan and Lady Spenſer, and thought himſelf well
enough at night to omit the opium draught, which he had been uſed
to take for ſome time. He ſlept very indifferently; before nine the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0112200701:322"/>
next morning he roſe, but could not eat his breakfaſt. However, he
appeared tolerably well, yet complained at times of a pain in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
At one o'clock he received a viſit of an hour from Madame
de Sylva, and at three, his friend, Mr. Craufurd, of Auchinames,
(whom he always mentioned with particular regard,) called, and
ſtayed with him till paſt five o'clock. They talked, as uſual, on
various ſubjects; and twenty hours before his death, Mr. Gibbon
happened to fall into a converſation, not uncommon with him, on
the probable duration of his life. He ſaid, that he thought himſelf
a good life for ten, twelve, or perhaps twenty years. About ſix,
he ate the wing of a chicken, and drank three glaſſes of Madeira.
After dinner he became very uneaſy and impatient; complained
a good deal, and appeared ſo weak, that his ſervant was alarmed.
Mr. Gibbon had ſent to his friend and relation, Mr. Robert Darell,
whoſe houſe was not far diſtant, deſiring to ſee him, and adding,
that he had ſomething particular to ſay. But, unfortunately, this
deſired interview never took place.</p>
               <p>During the evening he complained much of his ſtomach, and of
a diſpoſition to vomit. Soon after nine, he took his opium draught,
and went to bed. About ten, he complained of much pain, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that warm napkins might be applied to his ſtomach. He almoſt
inceſſantly expreſſed a ſenſe of pain till about four o'clock in the
morning, when he ſaid he found his ſtomach much eaſier. About
ſeven, the ſervant aſked, whether he ſhould ſend for Mr. Farquhar?
he anſwered, no; that he was as well as he had been the day before.
At about half paſt eight, he got out of bed, and ſaid he was "<hi>plus
adroit</hi>" than he had been for three months paſt, and got into bed again,
without aſſiſtance, better than uſual. About nine, he ſaid that he
would riſe. The ſervant, however, perſuaded him to remain in bed
till Mr. Farquhar, who was expected at eleven, ſhould come.
Till about that hour he ſpoke with great facility. Mr. Farquhar
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0112200701:323"/>
came at the time appointed, and he was then viſibly dying. When
the <hi>valet de chambre</hi> returned, after attending Mr. Farquhar out of
the room, Mr. Gibbon ſaid, "<hi>Pourquoi eſt ce que vous me quittez?</hi>"
This was about half paſt eleven. At twelve, he drank ſome brandy
and water from a tea-pot, and deſired his favourite ſervant to ſtay
with him. Theſe were the laſt words he pronounced articulately.
To the laſt he preſerved his ſenſes; and when he could no longer
ſpeak, his ſervant having aſked a queſtion, he made a ſign, to ſhew
that he underſtood him. He was quite tranquil, and did not ſtir;
his eyes half-ſhut. About a quarter before one, he ceaſed to breathe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The body was not opened till the fifth day after his death. It was then ſound, except that a degree of mortification, not very conſiderable, had taken place on a part of the <hi>colon;</hi> which, with the whole of the <hi>omentum,</hi> of a very enlarged ſize, had deſcended into the <hi>ſcrotum,</hi> forming a bag that hung down nearly as low as the knee. Since that part had been inflamed and ulcerated, Mr. Gibbon could not bear a trufs; and when the laſt ſix quarts of fluid were diſcharged, the <hi>colon</hi> and <hi>omentum</hi> deſcending lower, they, by their weight, drew the lower mouth of the ſtomach downwards to the <hi>os pubis,</hi> and this probably was the immediate cauſe of his death.</p>
                     <p>The following is the account of the appearance of the body, given by an eminent ſurgeon who opened it:</p>
                     <q>

The <hi>valet de chambre</hi> obſerved, that Mr. Gibbon did not, at any
time, ſhew the leaſt ſign of alarm, or apprehenſion of death; and
it does not appear that he ever thought himſelf in danger, unleſs
his deſire to ſpeak to Mr. Darell may be conſidered in that light.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I dwell too long on theſe minute and melancholy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Yet the cloſe of ſuch a life can hardly fail to intereſt every
reader; and I know that the public has received a different and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
account of my friend's laſt hours.</p>
               <p>I can never ceaſe to feel regret that I was not by his ſide at this
awful period: a regret ſo ſtrong, that I can expreſs it only by
borrowing (as the eloquent Mr. Maſon has done on a ſimilar oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion)
the forcible language of Tacitus: <hi>Mihi praeter acerbitatem</hi>
amici <hi>erepti, auget moeſtitiam quod aſſidere valetudini, fovere deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
ſatiari vultu, complexu non contigit.</hi> It is ſome conſolation to
me, that I have not, like Tacitus, by a long abſence, anticipated the
loſs of my friend ſeveral years before his deceaſe. Although I had
not the mournful gratification of being near him on the day he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
yet during his illneſs I had not failed to attend him with that
aſſiduity which his genius, his virtues, and, above all, our long, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted,
and happy friendſhip demanded.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>MR. Gibbon's Will is dated the 1ſt of October 1791, juſt before
I left Lauſanne; he diſtinguiſhes me, as uſual, in the moſt
flattering manner:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I conſtitute and appoint the Right Honourable John Lord Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,
Edward Darell Eſquire, and John Thomas Batt Eſquire,
to be the Executors of this my laſt Will and Teſtament; and as
the execution of this truſt will not be attended with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
or trouble, I ſhall indulge theſe gentlemen, in the pleaſure
of this laſt diſintereſted ſervice, without wronging my feelings, or
oppreſſing my heir, by too light or too weighty a teſtimony of
my gratitude. My obligations to the long and active friendſhip
of Lord Sheffield, I could never ſufficiently repay.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He then obſerves, that the Right Hon. Lady Eliot, of Port-Eliot,
is his neareſt relation on the father's ſide; but that her three ſons
are in ſuch proſperous circumſtances, that he may well be excuſed
for making the two children of his late uncle, Sir Stanier Porten, his
heirs; they being in a very different ſituation. He bequeaths an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities
to two old ſervants, three thouſand pounds, and his furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
plate, &amp;c. at Lauſanne, to Mr. Wilhelme de Severy; one
hundred guineas to the poor of Lauſanne, and fifty guineas each
to the following perſons: Lady Sheffield and daughters, Maria and
Louiſa, Madame and Madamoiſelle de Severy, the Count de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,
Mademoiſelle la Chanoineſſe de Polier, and M. le Miniſtre Le
Vade, for the purchaſe of ſome token which may remind them of
a ſincere friend. The remains of Mr. Gibbon were depoſited in
Lord Sheffield's family burial-place in Suſſex.</p>

THE Letters of Mr. Gibbon, from the time of his return to
Switzerland in 1788, are annexed to his Memoirs, as the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of them. Among his Letters of an earlier date, I find
ſeveral which he has alluded to, and other which will illuſtrate the
account he has given of himſelf. Theſe, I flatter myſelf, will
pleaſe the generality of readers; ſince, when he touches on matters
of private buſineſs, even ſubjects of the drieſt nature become inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting,
from his mode of treating them. Many Letters from diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
perſons to him will be introduced, and ſome that he received
at a very early period of life. Although we have not all his own
Letters to which theſe were anſwers, yet we have enough to teſtify
his ambition, even in youth, to be diſtinguiſhed as a ſcholar.</p>
            <p>It has been ſometimes thought neceſſary to offer to the Public an
apology for the publication of private Letters. I have no ſcruple to
ſay, that I publiſh theſe, becauſe I think they place my friend in
an advantageous point of view. He might not, perhaps, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that all his Letters ſhould be printed; but I have no reaſon
to believe that he would have been averſe to the publication of any.
If I had, they never would have been made public, however highly
I might have conceived of their excellence.</p>

                  <p>JE ne puis qu'être très ſenſible aux témoignages d'eſtime dont vous
voulez bien me combler, quoique je ſois fort éloigné de les pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre
à la lettre, et de me regarder comme un oracle. Mais je ſuis homme
vrai, et par la même qui aime à profiter des lumières que l'on a la

l'éclairciſſement d'un paſſage de Tite Live ſur lequel je m'avois ſu
qu'être embaraſſé. J'adopte toutes vos obſervations, tous vos raiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemens.
Par le changement d'une ſeule lettre, vous ſubſtituez à un
ſens louche et obſcur, une penſée claire, convenable au caractère de
celui qui parle, et bien liée avec tout le reſte du diſcours. Je ne
manquerai pas d'en faire une note, et de me ſervir de cette judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieuſe
correction, ſi l'occaſion s'en préſente, en prenant ſoin d'en
faire honneur à celui à qui je la dois.</p>
                  <p>J'ajouterai ſculement une remarque de peu de conſéquence, mais
qui me paroît néceſſaire pour donner toute ſa perfection à la phraſe,
ſur laquelle vous avez travaillé ſi heureuſement. Voici la phraſe
avec le changement que vous propoſez. <hi>Nec eſſe in vos otio veſtro

choſe qui doit être contraire au bien des Carthaginois, et qui par
conſéquence s'allie mal avec l'idée de leur repos. Ainſi au lieu de
ces mots <hi>in vos</hi> j'aimerois mieux lire <hi>in his.</hi> Alors la phraſe ſera

                  <p>I AM extremely obliged by your expreſſions of eſteem, without taking
them in the literal ſenſe, and believing myſelf an oracle. But I am a lover
of truth and ſincerity, and always ready to avail myſelf of the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of my learned friends. With the greateſt pleaſure, therefore, I received
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0112200701:329"/>
your ingenious conjecture illuſtrating a paſſage of Livy, by which I had
been puzzled. I adopt all your obſervations and reaſonings. By changing
a ſingle letter, you ſubſtitute, inſtead of an aukward and obſcure meaning, a
thought perſpicuous in itſelf, ſuitable to the character of the ſpeaker, and
connected with the purport of his diſcourſe. I ſhall not fail noticing this
judicious correction, when an opportunity occurs, and mentioning the name
of the perſon to whom I am indebted for it.</p>
                  <p>I will add only one remark, of ſmall importance indeed, but neceſſary for
giving complete correctneſs to the paſſage with which your attention has been
ſo ſucceſsfully occupied. With your emendation it runs thus: <hi>Nec eſſe in vos
otio veſtro conſultum ab Romanis credatis.</hi> The <hi>in vos</hi> does not appear to me
to correſpond well with <hi>otio veſtro;</hi> ſince it ſeems to indicate ſomething
adverſe to the intereſt of the Carthaginians, and therefore does not accord
well with the idea of their tranquillity. Inſtead of the words <hi>in vos</hi> I would
read <hi>in his;</hi> which would render the paſſage perfectly correct. <hi>Nec eſſe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0112200701:330"/>
in his otio veſtro conſultum ab Romanis credatis.</hi> 
                     <q>Do not believe that the
Romans, when they deprive you of your forces, and forbid you to make
war on foreign nations, mean thereby to promote your tranquillity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It remains only, Sir, that I ſhould thank you for your goodneſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to me ſo happy a thought. It would give me the greateſt pleaſure
to be frequently favoured with ſuch aſſiſtance in my literary labours.</p>

donc cette égliſe eſt chargée en tems de fête, je ſaiſis avec joie
quelques momens de repos pour m'entretenir, Monſieur, avec vous:
ce ſera, s'il vous plait, ſans faire de trop grands efforts ſur l'article
des idées innées que vous me propoſez. Outre que je riſquerois de
dire comme je ne ſais quelle des interlocutrices de Terence, <hi>Magno
conatu magnas nugas;</hi> il y a fort long tems que je n'ai relu
M. Locke, l'oracle moderne ſur cette matière, et il faudroit trop de
tems et de papier pour tout éplucher. Ayez donc la bonté de vous
contenter des premières réflexions qui ſe préſenteront ſur quelques
endroits de ſon premier livre.</p>

                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0112200701:332"/>
Je commence par le chap. i. § 5. où cet habile homme entreprend
de prouver que ces deux principes, <hi>Ce qui eſt, eſt; il eſt impoſſible
qu'une même choſe ſoit, et en même temps ne ſoit pas,</hi> ne ſont point
innées, puiſqu'ils n'étoient point dans l'eſprit pendant l'enfance; et
la preuve qu'ils n'y étoient pas, c'eſt que l'enfant n'y penſoit point,
et que bien des gens meurent, ſans les avoir jamais apperçus; <q>or, dit M. Locke, une idée ne ſauroit être dans l'eſprit, ſans que l'eſprit
ne s'en apperçoive,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Il eſt clair, Monſieur, que toute la force de ce raiſonnement, eſt
dans cette dernière aſſertion; mais cette aſſertion n'eſt elle pas evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demment
détruite par l'expérience? Apperçevez vous actuellement
toutes les idées que vous avez dans l'eſprit? N'y en a t'il point au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelles
vous ne prendrez peutêtre garde de pluſieurs années? Et
dans les efforts que l'on fait ſouvent pour rappeller ce qu'on a confié
à ſa mémoire; ne ſent on pas qu'il peut y avoir des connoiſſances ſi
cachées dans ſes replis, que loin de les apperçevoir ſans ceſſe, il faut
bien de la peine pour les rattrapper? Je ſais que M. Locke, qui a
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0112200701:333"/>
ſenti la difficulté, tache de la réſoudre. Ch. iii. § 20. Mais en vé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rité,
la longueur et l'embarras de cet article montre aſſez que M. L.
n'étoit par à ſon aiſe en l'écrivant; et comment y auroit il été?
Voici, autant que j'en puis juger, à quoi il ſe réduit. Il avoue, <q>Que
nous avons dans l'eſprit des idées que nous n'apperçevons point
actuellement; mais, dit-il, c'eſt dans la <hi>mémoire</hi> qu'elles ſont: et
cela eſt ſi vrai, qu'on ne ſe les rappelle point ſans ſe ſouvenir, en
même temps, qu'on les a déjà apperçues. Or, tel n'eſt point le
cas des <hi>idées</hi> qu'on pretend <hi>innées.</hi> Quand on les apperçoit pour
la première fois, ce n'eſt point avec réminiſcence, comme on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vroit,
ſi ces idées là avoient été dans l'eſprit avant cette première
apperception, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>De grâce, Monſieur, croyez vous que M. Locke s'entendit bien
lui même, quand il diſtinguoit <hi>etre dans l'eſprit</hi> et <hi>etre dans la mé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moire?</hi>
Et qu'importe à la queſtion, qu'on ſe ſouvienne d'avoir
déjà ſu ce que l'on ſe rappelle, s'il n'en eſt pas moins vrai qu'on l'a
eu long temps dans l'eſprit ſans s'en apperçevoir; ce qui eſt le point
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0112200701:334"/>
dont il s'agit? Au reſte, M. Locke auroit pu ſentir que ſi l'on ne
ſe <hi>rappelle</hi> point les idées innées par <hi>réminiſcence,</hi> e'eſt qu'elles ne
ſont point entrées dans l'eſprit d'une manière qui ait exigé, ou attiré
ſon attention. Et c'eſt auſſi le cas de pluſieurs idées acquiſes; car,
quoiqu'en dire M. Locke, chacun ſe trouve au beſoin, nombre d'idées
qui ne peuvent s'être inſinuées dans ſon eſprit, qu'à la préſence
de certains objets, auquels il n'a point pris garde, ou, en général,
par des moyens inconnus, qui l'ont enrichi ſans qu'il ſache com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
et ſans qu'il crût les avoir juſques au moment qu'elles ſe
ſont préſentées.</p>
                  <p>Sur le fond même de la queſtion, il me ſemble que M. Locke
confond perpétuellement deux choſes très différentes. <hi>L'idée elle
même,</hi> qui eſt une connoiſſance dans l'eſprit et un principe de rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnement;
et <hi>l'énoncé de cette idée</hi> en forme de propoſition, ou de
définition. Il ſe peut, et il eſt même très probable, que bien des
gens n'ont jamais formé ou enviſagé en eux mêmes cet énoncé,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0112200701:335"/>
                     <hi>il eſt impoſſible qu'une choſe ſoit, et ne ſoit pas en même tems.</hi> Voyez
Liv. 1. ch. i. § 12. Mais ſuit-il delà, qu'ils ne connoiſſent pas la
vérité qu'il exprime, et qu'ils n'en ont pas l'idée?—Nullement. Tout
homme qui aſſure, qui nie, tout homme qui parle, un enfant quand
il demande, quand il refuſe, quand il ſe plaint, &amp;c. ne ſuppoſe t'il
pas, que dès qu'une choſe eſt, il eſt impoſſible qu'en même tems.
elle ne ſoit pas? Ne trouvez vous pas, Monſieur, qu'on pourroit
ſoutenir la réalité des idées innées, préciſément ſur ce que M. Locke
allégue contre elles, que beaucoup de gens n'ont jamais penſé aux
propoſitions évidentes dont il parle; car, puiſque ſans y avoir
penſé, ils s'en ſervent, ils bâtiſſent là deſſus, ils jugent de la vérité,
ou de l'abſurdité d'un diſcours par ſes rapports avec ces principes
là, &amp;c. D'où leur vient cette familiarité avec des principes qu'ils
n'ont jamais appercçus diſtinctement, ſi ce n'eſt de ce qu'ils en ont
une connoiſſance, ou ſi l'on veut, un ſentiment naturel?</p>
                  <p>Aux § 17 et 18, M. Locke nei que le conſentement que l'on
donne à certaines propoſitions, dès qu'on les entend prononcer, ſoit
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0112200701:336"/>
une preuve que l'idée qu'elles expriment ſoit innée; et il ſe fonde,
ſur ce qu'il y a bien des propoſitions que l'on reçoit ainſi d'abord,
qui certainement ne ſont point innées; et il en donne divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emples,
viz. <hi>deux &amp; deux ſont quotre,</hi> &amp;c. Mais ne vous paroîtra
t'il pas qu'il confond içi de ſimples définitions de mots avec des
vérités évidentes par elles mêmes? Au moins, eſt il certain que
tous ſes exemples ſont de ſimples définitions des mots, <hi>deux et deux
ſont quatre.</hi> L'idée qu'on exprime par <hi>deux et deux,</hi> eſt la même
que celle qu'on exprime par <hi>quatre,</hi> &amp;c. Or perſonne ne dit que
la connoiſſance d'une définition de mots ſoit innée, puiſqu'elle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
celle du langage. Mais cette propoſition, <hi>le tout eſt plus grand
que chacune de ſes parties,</hi> n'eſt point dans ce cas; et il eſt certain
que le plus petit enfant ſuppoſe la vérité de cette propoſition
toutes les fois que non content d'une moitié de pomme, il veut la
pomme toute entière.</p>
                  <p>Prenez la peine, Monſieur, d'examiner le § 23; où M. Locke veut
convaincre de fauſſeté cette ſuppoſition, qu'il y a des principes tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
<hi>innés,</hi> que ceux qui en entendent pour la première fois, et
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0112200701:337"/>
qui en comprennent l'énoncé, n'apprennent rien de nouveau. <q>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mièrement,
dit-il, il eſt clair qu'ils ont appris les <hi>termes</hi> de l'énoncé
et la <hi>ſignification</hi> de ces termes.</q> Mais qui ne voit que M. Locke
ſort de la queſtion? Perſonne n'a jamais dit que des termes, qui ne
ſont que des ſignes arbitraires de nos idées, fuſſent innés. Il ajoute,
<q>Que les idées renfermées dans de pareils énoncés ne naiſſent pas
plus avec nous, que leurs expreſſions, et qu'on acquiert ces idées
dans la ſuite après en avoir appris les noms.</q> Mais, 1. N'eſt ce
pas donner pour preuve de ce qu'on affirme, cette affirmation même?
Il n'y a point d'idées innées, car il n'y en a que d'acquiſes! M.
Locke riroit bien d'un pareil raiſonnement, s'il le trouvoit dans ſes
adverſaires. 2. S'il eſt vrai qu'on apprend les mots avant que
d'avoir les idées qu'ils expriment, au moins s'il eſt vrai que cela ſoit
toujours ainſi, comme M. Locke l'entend, je voudrois bien ſavoir
comment la première langue a pu être formée? Et même comment
il eſt poſſible qu'on faſſe comprendre à quelqu'un le ſens d'un mot

                  </p>
                  <p>Au § 27, M. Locke nie les idées innées, parcequ'elles ne paroîſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ni dans les enfans, ni dans les imbécilles, où elles devroient pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roître
le plus. Mais, 1. Ceux qui admettent les idées innées, ne les
croyent pas plus naturelles à l'ame, que ſes facultes; puis donc que
l'état et la conſtitution du corps nuit à celles-ci dans les imbécilles,
elle ſera auſſi cauſe qu'on ne leur remarque point les autres. 2. Le
fait même n'eſt pas entièrement vrai; les enfans et les imbécilles ont
l'idée de leur exiſtence, de leur individualité, de leur identité, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Dans le reſte de ce §, M. Locke ſe divertit au depens de ceux qui
croyent que les énoncés des maximes abſtraites ſont innées: mais les
plus déterminés ſcholaſtiques n'ont jamais rien dit de ſemblable, et il
rit d'une chimère qu'il s'eſt faite lui même.</p>
                  <p>Je ne ſais, Monſieur, comment il eſt arrivé qu'au lieu de trois ou
quatre courtes réflexions que j'aurois du vous donner ſur tout ceci,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0112200701:339"/>
je me ſuis engagé dans une critique longue et ennuyeuſe, de quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
endroits d'un ſeul chapitre: c'eſt apparemment un reſte de
laſſitude: j'ai trouvé plus de facilité à ſuivre et à chicaner M. Locke
qu'à penſer tout ſeul. Prenez patience et pardonnez. J'entrevois bien
des choſes à dire ſur le ſecond chapitre, où il s'agit des principes innés
de pratique; mais je ne vous en fatiguerai qu'après en avoir reçu
l'aveu de vous même.</p>
                  <p>On écrit içi, que le Roi de Pruſſe vient de battre les Autrichiens et
de leur tuer 20 mille hommes, en ayant perdu 15 mille des ſiens.
Voilà donc où il alloit en paſſant par Leipſic. Si cette nouvelle eſt
vraie, la guerre ne fauroit manquer de devenir générale, et de l'air
qu'elle commence, elle ſera terrible: mais je crains bien que ſa M. P.
n'ait le ſort de Charles XII. Qui le ſoutiendra contre la France,
l'Autriche, et peutêtre, la Ruſſie reunies?</p>

                  <p>AFTER eſcaping from the tumult of public functions, in which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of this church are employed during the holydays, I ſit down with
much pleaſure to converſe with you a few minutes on paper; without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make any very violent exertion in anſwering the queſtions concerning
innate ideas, which you propoſe for my conſideration. I am not willing to
riſk the being obliged to ſay, with one of Terence's characters, <hi>Magno
conatu magnas nugas;</hi> beſides, it is long ſince I looked into Locke, the
modern oracle on that ſubject; and too much time and paper would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
completely to canvaſs ſo intricate a ſubject. You will have the
goodneſs, therefore, to be contented with the firſt reflections that occur to
me on ſome paſſages of his firſt book.</p>

                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0112200701:332"/>
In chapter. i. § 5. that able writer undertakes to prove that the axioms,
<q>Whatever is, is;</q> and <q>It is impoſſible for the ſame thing to be and
not to be at the ſame time;</q> are not innate; becauſe children are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
ignorant of them, as appears from their never taking notice of them;
and many perſons die without ever perceiving the truth of theſe axioms;
<q>but it is impoſſible,</q> Mr. Locke obſerves, <q>for an idea to be in the
mind, which the mind never takes notice of.</q> It is plain that the
whole weight of his reaſoning reſts on this laſt aſſertion; which aſſertion
itſelf ſeems to be manifeſtly contradicted by experience. Do you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
Sir, at this moment all the ideas that are in your mind? Are
there not ſome of them which you may not, perhaps, take notice of for
many years? In the efforts which we make to recall things to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
are we not ſenſible that ſome ideas may be ſo deeply hidden in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
that inſtead of continually perceiving them, we have no ſmall trouble
in bringing them back to our remembrance? I know that Mr. Locke,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0112200701:333"/>
c. iii. § 20, endeavours to obviate theſe objections; but the length and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
of that article ſhews that he was not at eaſe in writing it. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
could he be ſo? ſince, as far as I am able to judge, the following is
the reſult of his argument: <q>I confeſs that we have ideas in the mind, of
which we are not conſcious; but then theſe ideas are in the memory; as
appears from this, that we never recall them without remembering that
they formerly were objects of our perception. But this is not ſuppoſed to
hold with regard to what are called innate ideas. When theſe are perceived
for the firſt time, it is not with reminiſcence, which would certainly be the
caſe if they had been in the mind before this firſt perception of them,
&amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed to tell me, Sir, whether you think that Mr. Locke himſelf will
underſtood the diſtinction which he makes between <hi>being in the mind,</hi> and
<hi>being in the memory?</hi> And of what importance is it, that we remember
to have formerly had the recalled ideas, provided it be allowed that we had
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0112200701:334"/>
them long, without taking any notice of them, which is the point in queſtion?
Beſides, Mr. Locke ought to have known that innate ideas are not recalled
with reminiſcence, becauſe thoſe ideas come originally into the mind in a
way that neither excites nor requires our attention; for whatever Mr. Locke
may ſay, every one may be ſenſible from his own experience, that many
even of his acquired ideas could not have come into his mind independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
of the preſence of certain objects of which he had never taken any
notice; or, in general, independently of certain unknown cauſes, which
enriched him, without his being ſenſible of it, with ideas that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
himſelf poſſeſſed of, till they actually preſented themſelves to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                  <p>As to the main queſtion, Mr. Locke ſeems to me perpetually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
two things extremely different; the idea itſelf, which is a perception
of the mind, and a principle of reaſoning; and the expreſſion of that idea
in the form of a propoſition or definition. It is poſſible, nay, very probable,
that many perſons have never formed, or thought of the propoſition, <q>It
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0112200701:335"/>
is impoſſible for the ſame thing to be and not to be at the ſame time.</q>
See Locke, b. i. c. 1. § 12. But does it follow from this, that they are
ignorant of the truth expreſſed by theſe words? By no means. Every
man who affirms, denies, or ſpeaks; a child who aſks, refuſes, or complains,
muſt know the truth of this propoſition. Does it not appear to you, Sir,
that the doctrine of innate ideas may be defended on the ſame principle by
which Mr. Locke attacks it; namely, that many perſons have never thought
of the propoſitions or deſcriptions by which they are expreſſed? For if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever having thought of thoſe propoſitions, they make uſe of them in
their reaſonings, and employ them in judging of the juſtneſs or abſurdity of
every diſcourſe which they hear, how could they be ſo familiar with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which they never diſtinctly took notice of, unleſs they had a natural
knowledge or innate perception of them?</p>
                  <p>In paragraphs 17 and 18, Mr. Locke denies that our conſenting to certain
propoſitions at firſt hearing them, is a proof that the ideas expreſſed by them
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0112200701:336"/>
are innate; ſince many propoſitions, thus aſſented to, evidently expreſs
ideas that had been acquired, for example, <hi>two and two make four,</hi> &amp;c.
But does it not appear to you, that he here confounds the definition of words
with ſelf-evident truths? at leaſt, all the examples which he gives are mere
definitions. The idea expreſſed by <hi>two and two</hi> is preciſely the ſame with
the idea of <hi>four.</hi> Nobody ſays that our knowledge of the definitions of
words is innate, becauſe that would imply language to be ſo. But the
knowledge of this truth, that the whole is greater than its part, does not
imply that ſuppoſition, ſince an infant ſhews itſelf acquainted with this
principle, when, diſſatisfied with the half of an apple, it indicates its deſire
to poſſeſs the whole.</p>
                  <p>Take the trouble, Sir, to examine § 23; in which Mr. Locke endeavours
to diſprove the aſſertion, that there are ſome principles ſo truly innate, that
thoſe who hear them expreſſed in words for the firſt time, immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0112200701:337"/>
them without learning any thing new. <q>Firſt of all,</q> he obſerves,
<q>it is clear they muſt have learned the terms of the expreſſion, and the
meaning of thoſe terms.</q> But here Mr. Locke manifeſtly departs from
the queſtion. Nobody ſays that words, which are merely arbitrary ſigns of
our ideas, are innate. He adds, <q>that the ideas denoted by theſe expreſſions
are no more born with us than the expreſſions themſelves, and that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the ideas after firſt learning the terms by which they are expreſſed.</q>
But, 1. Is not this to take for granted the thing to be proved? There are
no innate ideas, for all ideas are acquired. Mr. Locke would laugh at his
adverſaries, were they to make uſe of ſuch an argument. 2. If words are
learned before ideas, at leaſt if that is always the caſe, as Mr. Locke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
it to be, I would be glad to know how the firſt language could
have been formed, or how it could be poſſible to communicate to any one
the meaning of a word altogether new to him? A perſon who had no idea
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0112200701:338"/>
of order, for example, would be no more capable of underſtanding the word
order, than a man born blind could underſtand the word colour.</p>
                  <p>In paragraph 27, Mr. Locke denies innate ideas, becauſe they are not
found in children and idiots, in whom we ought moſt to expect meeting
with them. I anſwer, 1. Thoſe who admit innate ideas, do not believe
them more natural to the mind than its faculties; and as the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the body diſturbs the faculties of idiots, the ſame cauſe may
hinder them from ſhowing any ſigns of innate ideas. 2. The fact is not
ſtrictly true. Even idiots and infants have the idea of their exiſtence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuality,
identity, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the remainder of that paragraph, Mr. Locke diverts himſelf with the
abſurdity of thoſe who believe the expreſſions of abſtract maxims to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
but the moſt determined ſcholaſtic never maintained any ſuch opinion;
and he combats a chimera which is the work of his own fancy.</p>
                  <p>I know not how it has happened that, inſtead of a few general reflections
which I intended, I have ſent you a long and tireſome criticiſm on ſome
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0112200701:339"/>
paſſages of a ſingle chapter. The remains of laſſitude, probably, made it
eaſier for me to follow and diſpute with Mr. Locke, than to think and
reaſon alone. Have patience, and pardon me. There are many remarks
to make on the ſecond chapter where he treats of innate practical principles.
But I will not tire you with that ſubject, unleſs you deſire it.</p>
                  <p>Our newſpapers ſay, that the King of Pruſſia has beat the Auſtrians, and
killed twenty thouſand of their men; with the loſs of fifteen thouſand of his
own. This was the object he had in view when he paſſed through Leipſick.
If the news be true, the war muſt become general; and, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
it will be terrible. But I much fear leſt his Pruſſian Majeſty
meet with the fate of Charles XII. What are his reſources for defence
againſt the united ſtrength of France and Auſtria, and perhaps of Ruſſia?</p>
                  <p>I have the honour to be, with the moſt perfect conſideration, yours, &amp;c.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>JE ſuis charmé de l'exactitude et de la pénétration qui ſe diſputent
le terrein dans la dernière lettre que vous avez pris la peine de
m'écrire: et comme vous, Monſieur, je crois que la queſtion touche
à ſa déciſion.</p>
                  <p>Vous avez ſans doute raiſon de dire que les propoſitions évidentes
dont il s'agit, ne ſont pas de ſimples idées, mais des jugemens. Mais
ayez auſſi la complaiſance de reconnoître que M. Locke les alleguant
en exemple d'idées qui paſſent pour innées et qui ne le ſont pas ſelon
lui, s'il y a içi de la mépriſe, c'eſt lui qu'il faut relever là-deſſus, et
non pas moi, qui n'avois autre choſe à faire qu'à refuter ſa manière
de raiſonner contre l'innéïté de ces idées, ou jugmens là. D'ailleurs,
Monſieur, vous remarquerez, s'il vous plait, que dans cette diſpute
il s'agit en eſſet, de ſavoir ſi certaines vérités évidentes et com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes,
et non pas ſeulement certaines idées ſimples, ſont innées ou
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0112200701:341"/>
non. Ceux qui affirment, ne donnent guère pour exemple d'idées
ſimples qui le ſoyent, que celles de Dieu, de l'unité, et de l'exiſtence:
les autres exemples ſont pris de propoſitions completes, que vous
appellez jugemens.</p>
                  <p>Mais, dites vous, y aura t'il donc des jugemens innés? Le juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
eſt il autre choſe qu'un acte de nos facultés intellectuelles dans
la comparaiſon des idées? Le jugement ſur les vérités évidentes,
n'eſt il pas une ſimple vue de ces vérités là, un ſimple coup d'oeil que
l'eſprit jette ſur elles? J'accorde tout cela. Et de grace, qu'eſt ce
qu'<hi>idée?</hi> N'eſt ce pas <hi>vue,</hi> ou coup d'oeil, ſi vous voulez? Ceux
qui définiſſent l'idée autrement, ne s'éloignent ils pas viſiblement du
ſens et de l'intention du mot? Dire que les idées ſont les eſpeces
des choſes imprimées dans l'eſprit, comme l'image de l'objet ſenſible
tracée dans l'oeil, n'eſt ce pas jargonner plutôt que définir? Or c'eſt
la faute, qu'ont fait tous les metaphyſiciens, et quoique M. Locke
l'ait bien ſentie, il a mieux aimé ſe fâcher contre eux, et tirer contre
les girouettes de la place, que s'appliquer à démêler ce galimatias.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0112200701:342"/>
Que n'a-t'il dit: non ſeulement il n'y a point d'idées innées dans le
ſens de ces Meſſieurs; mais il n'y a point d'idées du tout dans ce ſens
là: toute idée eſt un acte, une vue, un coup d'oeil de l'eſprit.
Dès lors demander s'il y a des idées innées, c'eſt demander s'il y a
certaines vérités ſi évidentes et ſi communes que tout eſprit non
ſtupide puiſſe naturellement, ſans culture et ſans maître, ſans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion,
ſans raiſonnement, les reconnoître d'un coup d'oeil, et ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
même ſans s'apperçevoir qu'on jette ce coup d'oeil. L'affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
me paroît inconteſtable, et ſelon moi, le queſtion eſt vuidée
par là.</p>
                  <p>Maintenant prenez garde, Monſieur, que cette manière d'entendre
l'affaire, va au but des partiſans des idées innées, tout comme la
leur; et par la même, contredit M. Locke dans le ſien. Car pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoi
voudroit on qu'il y eu des idées innées? C'eſt pour en oppoſer
la certitude et l'évidence au doute univerſel des ſceptiques, qui eſt
ruiné d'un ſeul coup, s'il y a des vérités dont la vue ſoit néceſſaire
et naturelle à l'homme. Or vous ſentez, Monſieur, que je puis
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0112200701:343"/>
leur dire cela dans ma façon d'expliquer la choſe, tout auſſi bien que
les partiſans ordinaires des idées innées dans la leur. Et voilà ce
qui ſemble incommoder un peu M. Locke, qui, ſans ſe declarer
pyrrhonien, laiſſe apperçevoir un peu trop de foible pour le pyrrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
et a beaucoup contribué à le nourrir dans ce ſiècle. A
force de vouloir marquer les bornes de nos connoiſſances, ce qui
étoit fort néceſſaire, il a quelquefois tout mis en bornes.</p>
                  <p>Après ces remarques générales ſur le fond de la queſtion, il eſt peu
néceſſaire de s'arrêter à quelques particulières, où vous ne me croyez
pas fondé. Cependant vous me permettrez de vous faire obſerver
ſur celles que vous relevez: 1. Que dans ce § 5. du ch. 1. il eſt
bien vrai que M. Locke mêle ces deux choſes, être actuellement dans
l'eſprit, <hi>ſans que l'eſprit s'en apperçoive</hi>—et, y être, <hi>ſans qu'il s'en ſoit
jamais apperçu.</hi>—Mais il eſt certain auſſi, qu'à la concluſion de ce §,
il s'en tient au premier incognito, et donne lieu à ma critique en
s'exprimant en ces termes. Je ſuis la traduction Françoiſe n'ayant
pas l'original. <q>De ſorte, dit-il, que ſoutenir qu'une choſe ſoit
dans l'entendement, et qu'elle n'eſt pas conçue par l'entendement,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0112200701:344"/>
qu'elle eſt dans l'eſprit, ſans que l'eſprit l'apperçoive, c'eſt autant
que ſi l'on diſoit, qu'une choſe eſt, et n'eſt pas dans l'eſprit ou
dans l'entendement.</q> N'eſt il pas clair, Monſieur, que ce grand
philoſophe, écrivant cela, étoit dans l'erreur, ou la mépriſe de fait
que je prends la liberté de lui reprocher; c'eſt que l'eſprit ne peut
avoir aucune connoiſſance qu'il ne l'apperçoive actuellement? Je
crois bien que ſi on l'avoit d'abord relevé là-deſſus il auroit ſenti
ſa mépriſe, mais il n'en eſt pas moins vrai, et qu'il y eſt tombé,
et qu'il s'en fait un principe contre ſes adverſaires.</p>
                  <p>2. Vous voulez qu'on lui paſſe ſa diſtinction entre les idées qui
<hi>ſont dans l'eſprit</hi> et celles qui ſont <hi>dans la mémoire:</hi> à moi ne tienne,
pourvu que vous preniez le mot d'idée comme moi; car, en ce ſens,
une idée eſt dans l'eſprit, lorſque l'eſprit enviſage actuellement la
propoſition qui eſt l'objet de ſon idée, ou de ſon coup d'oeil; et
elle n'eſt que dans la mémoire, lorſque l'eſprit ayant auparavant jetté
ce coup d'oeil ſur elle, en a plus de facilité à la réitérer, et en le
réitérant, ſent que ce n'eſt pas la première fois qu'il enviſage cette
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0112200701:345"/>
propoſition là.—Mais ſi par idées, vous entendez ces <hi>eſpeces</hi> chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mériques,
ſuppoſées par les métaphyſiciens, et autant qu'il m'en
ſouvient, pas aſſez nettement congédiées par M. Locke, j'en re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viens,
s'il vous plait, à ma prétenſion, qu'on ne s'entend pas ſoi
même quand on diſtingue la mémoire de l'eſprit.</p>
                  <p>Un violent mal de tête que j'ai apporté de notre vénérable claſſe,
ne me permet pas d'étendre davantage cette lettre, et m'empêche
de la faire moins courte et plus nette. Je vous prie, Monſieur, de
l'excuſer telle qu'elle eſt. Peut être, pénétrant comme vous l'êtes,
ne laiſſerez vous pas d'y entrevoir dequoi prévenir toute difficulté
ſur les principes innés de pratique: M. Locke me paroît plus fort
içi que ſur les autres, mais il n'a pas laiſſé de s'y embaraſſer un
peu par-ci par-là.</p>
                  <p>Je me faiſois une fête de vous voir un moment à Vevay, et j'ai
été capot d'être <hi>diſappointed;</hi> ſi j'entends ce mot de votre langue,
le notre n'en a point qui peut dire ſi bien la même choſe. Je n'ai
même vu M. Pavillard que dans l'aſſemblée.</p>

Si la marche de 120 mille Ruſſes n'eſt pas une fable, que va
devenir S. M. Pruſſienne? Ne croyez vous pas, Monſieur, que nous
touchons à de grandes revolutions? Il y a long tems que je ſoup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çonne
un plan formé, de réduire le ſyſtême général à trois grands
empires; celui des François, à l'occident du Rhin, celui d'Autriche
à l'orient, et celui des Ruſſes au nord. Il n'y en a pourtant rien
dans l'Apocalypſe. Qu'on partage la terre comme on voudra, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vu
qu'il y ſoit toujours permis de croire, que ce qui eſt, eſt; et que
les contradictoires ne peuvent pas être vraies en même temps. Au
reſte ces trois empires auroient beau être grands, méſurés à nos toiſes,
ils paroîtroient toujours bien petits, vus ſeulement depuis la lune, et
à quelle hauteur ne s'élevent pas par delà des yeux philoſophes.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I am delighted with your laſt letter, equally diſtinguiſhed by accuracy and
penetration; and with you, Sir, I believe that the queſtion approaches to
its deciſion.</p>
                  <p>You are right in ſaying, that the ſelf-evident propoſitions, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
are not merely ideas, but judgments: yet you will have the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to obſerve, that Mr. Locke having given them as examples of ideas
which paſs for being innate, but which he does not regard as ſuch, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
is chargeable on him, and not on me, who had nothing farther to do
than to refute his manner of reaſoning. Beſides, you will be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that the real queſtion is, whether not only certain ideas, but alſo
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0112200701:341"/>
certain common and ſelf-evident propoſitions be innate. The only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
produced of innate ideas are thoſe of God, unity, and exiſtence;
the other examples are of innate propoſitions, which you call judgments.</p>
                  <p>You aſk, whether it be poſſible that our judgments ſhould be innate,
judgment being nothing elſe but the act of our intellectual faculties in
comparing our ideas, and our judgment concerning ſelf-evident truths
being merely the perception of thoſe truths by a ſimple glance of the
mind? I grant all that, but would aſk, what elſe is an idea but a glance of
the mind? Thoſe who define it otherwiſe, widely depart from the original
ſenſe of the word; and talk unintelligibly, when they ſay that ideas are
ſpecies; that is, appearances of things impreſſed on the mind, as the images
of corporeal objects are impreſſed on the eye. All metaphyſicians have
committed this miſtake; and Mr. Locke, though ſenſible of it, has choſen
in his anger to direct his batteries againſt the weathercocks, rather than
againſt the building itſelf. According to the meaning of theſe metaphyſicians,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0112200701:342"/>
there are ſurely no innate ideas, becauſe in their ſenſe of the word there are no
ideas whatever. An idea is merely an act or perception of the mind: and
the queſtion concerning innate ideas is merely to determine, whether certain
truths be not ſo common and ſo evident, that every mind, not abſolutely
ſtupid, muſt recognize them at a ſingle glance, without the aſſiſtance of any
teacher, and without the intervention of any diſcuſſion or reaſoning; and
often without being ſenſible that this glance is caſt on them? The affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative
appears to me incontrovertible; and the queſtion thereby is ſolved.</p>
                  <p>You will pleaſe to remark, that this way of explaining the matter is as
favourable to innate ideas, and therefore as oppoſite to Mr. Locke's doctrine,
as the unintelligible hypotheſis above mentioned. For what reaſon do we
contend in favour of innate ideas? To oppoſe evidence and certainty to
univerſal ſcepticiſm; whoſe cauſe is ruined by proving certain truths to be
ſo neceſſary and ſo natural to man, that they are univerſally recognized by
a ſingle glance. This may be proved according to my meaning of the word
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0112200701:343"/>
idea, as well as according to the ſenſe in which this word is vulgarly taken,
and the proof would not have been very pleaſing to Mr. Locke, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
profeſſing himſelf a ſceptic, yet ſhews a leaning to the ſceptical ſide;
and whoſe works have contributed much to the diffuſion of ſcepticiſm in the
preſent age. His too eager deſire of fixing the limits of human knowledge,
a thing highly neceſſary, has made him leave nothing but limits.</p>
                  <p>After theſe general obſervations on the main queſtion, it is not very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to deſcend to the particulars in which you think me miſtaken. Yet
you will permit me to anſwer your objections. 1. It is true, that Mr. Locke,
§ 5. c. 1. joins the two expreſſions, <q>being in the mind, without being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
perceived by the mind,</q> and <q>being in the mind, without having ever
been perceived by the mind;</q> but at the concluſion of the paragraph he lays
himſelf open to my criticiſm, by expreſſing himſelf as follows: <q>So that to
be in the underſtanding and not to be underſtood, to be in the mind and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0112200701:344"/>
never to be perceived, is all one as to ſay, any thing is and is not in the
mind or underſtanding.</q> It is clear, Sir, that this great philoſopher
erred in writing this paſſage; maintaining, what I took the liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict,
that nothing could be in the underſtanding without being perceived
to be there. I doubt not that he would have corrected this miſtake had it
been pointed out to him; but the certainly falls into it, and employs it as a
principle of reaſoning againſt his adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>2. You think that we ought to admit his diſtinction between <q>ideas in the
mind,</q> and <q>ideas in the memory.</q> I admit the diſtinction with all my
heart, provided you take the word idea in the ſame acceptation as I do. In that
ſenſe an idea is in the mind, when the mind actually conſiders the propoſition
which is the object of its idea, that is, of its glance or perception; and an
idea is in the memory when the mind, having formerly caſt that glance on
it, finds thereby a greater facility in recalling it, remembering at the ſame
time that it formerly was the object of its perception. But if you underſtand
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0112200701:345"/>
by ideas theſe chimerical ſpecies, the mere fictions of metaphyſicians, and,
as it ſeems to me, not ſufficiently diſproved by Mr. Locke, I return to my
aſſertion, and maintain that the diſtinction is unintelligible between <q>being
in the mind,</q> and <q>being in the memory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A violent headach, which I brought with me from our venerable claſs,
hinders me from continuing this letter, or rendering what I have already written
ſhorter and more perſpicuous. I intreat you to excuſe its imperfections.
Your penetration will perhaps diſcern how all difficulties may be ſolved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
innate practical principles. Mr. Locke treats this ſubject better than
he does the others; but in ſeveral parts he is ſomewhat puzzled.</p>
                  <p>I rejoiced at the hopes of ſeeing you for a moment at Vevay, and was
ſurpriſed at being <hi>diſappointed.</hi> If I rightly underſtand this word of your
language, it cannot be well tranſlated into ours. I met with Mr. Pavillard
only in the aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0112200701:346"/>
If the march of an hundred and twenty thouſand Ruſſians is not a fable,
what muſt become of the King of Pruſſia? Does it not appear to you,
that we are threatened with great revolutions? I have long ſuſpected a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of reducing the general ſyſtem of Europe to three great empires; that
of the French on the weſt of the Rhine, of Auſtria on the eaſt, and of
Ruſſia in the north. Yet we read of nothing of this kind in the Revelation.
But let the world be divided as it may, provided it be lawful for us to believe
that <q>whatever is, is;</q> and <q>that two contradictory propoſitions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
both at the ſame time be true.</q> Thoſe three empires will be great
only when meaſured on this earth; viewed but from the moon, they will be
ſmall enough; and how far do philoſophical eyes ſoar beyond that luminary!</p>
                  <p>I have the honour to be, with much conſideration, yours, &amp;c. ALLAMAND.</p>

                  <p>THOUGH I am Davus, not Oedipus, I will give you my opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the difficulties in Juſtin, which you propoſe for my conſideration.</p>
                  <p>1. In the third chapter of his ſecond book he ſays, <q>That Aſia was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
fifteen centuries to the Scythians, and that Ninus put an end to
thoſe contributions.</q> The number of years is ſo manifeſtly erroneous,
that it is aſtoniſhing ſuch a reading ſhould ever have been admitted into the
text; for it makes Ninus later than Seſoſtris by a period of fifteen hundred
years. Oroſius, who abridged Juſtin with the greateſt fidelity, ſpeaks to the
following purpoſe: <q>The Scythians would have raviſhed the whole of
Egypt, had they not been prevented by the marſhes. When they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from that country, they made a bloody conqueſt of Aſia, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it tributary. Having remained there fifteen reſtleſs years, they at
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0112200701:348"/>
length returned home, at the earneſt intreaty of their wives; who ſaid,
that unleſs their huſbands came home to them, they would, for the ſake
of having children, cohabit with their neighbours. <bibl>Oroſius, lib. i. c. 14.</bibl>
                     </q>
There cannot be any doubt, therefore, that "fifteen hundred" has been
ſubſtituted for "fifteen." You inveſtigate very ingeniouſly the cauſe of the
error; but the emendation which you propoſe, by changing <hi>per mille</hi> into
<hi>permiſſa,</hi> cannot be well founded, if the number was expreſſed, as is moſt
probable, by arithmetical marks in the ancient copies.</p>
                  <p>2. In Juſtin, lib. xii. c. 8. we read, <q>They (the Macedonians) returned,
after beating the enemy, with congratulations, or thankſgivings, into the
ſame camp.</q> In this paſſage you ſeem to me needleſsly to diſturb the
ancient reading. You aſſume, without proof, that they did not venture to
attack the Cuphites. Oroſius, Juſtin's faithful interpreter, declares the
direct contrary. <q>When they came to the country of the Choſides, they
fought with two hundred thouſand of the enemy's cavalry; and, having
conquered them with much difficulty, becauſe they themſelves were now
worn out with years and fatigue, and ſunk in ſpirit, they formed a camp
more magnificent than uſual, to commemorate their exploit. <bibl>Oroſius,
lib. iii. c. 19.</bibl>
                     </q> They did not, therefore, return into their camp until they had
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0112200701:349"/>
combated and conquered the enemy. Juſtin himſelf gives us to underſtand
as much, when he ſays, <q>That Alexander, moved by ſuch juſt prayers,
cauſed, at the end of his <hi>victory,</hi> a camp to be formed, whoſe walls might
<hi>inſpire terror</hi> into the enemy.</q> If the Macedonians, therefore, as you
imagine, had been frightened at the innumerable forces of the Cuphites, and
therefore returned haſtily into their camp, I do not ſee why Juſtin ſhould
ſay, <hi>at the end of his victory, inſpire terror into the enemy,</hi> or <hi>that they
returned to their camp with thankſgivings.</hi> It may here be remarked, in
oppoſition to Sebiſius' emendation, that the expreſſion, <hi>cum gratulatione,</hi> if
tranſlated "with thankſgivings," will include the <hi>caeſis hoſtiis,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;
that is, the <hi>ſacrifice of thanks;</hi> ſo that your alteration of <hi>caeſis hoſtiis</hi>
into <hi>omiſſis hoſtibus,</hi> is equally inconſiſtent with hiſtorical truth and the
words of Juſtin.</p>
                  <p>3. In Juſtin, lib. xxiv. c. viii. we read, <q>Part of the mountain carried
away by the earthquake overwhelmed the army of the Gauls; and its
thick maſſes breaking in ſcattered pieces, fell down with great force, not
without wounding the enemy.</q> You need not be offended with the harſh
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0112200701:350"/>
tranſpoſition of the word <hi>hoſtium,</hi> which you think ought to be joined with
<hi>confertiſſimi cunei;</hi> as if that laſt word meant, the military <hi>cunei,</hi> or wedges,
of the Gauls; whereas it really means the thick maſſes detached from the
rock or mountain, which, breaking into ſmaller fragments, fell down and
wounded the enemy, that is, the Gauls. There is no tranſpoſition therefore
in the caſe; the ſentence flows in the moſt natural order; and the <hi>confertiſſimi
cunei</hi> ought not to be joined with <hi>hoſtium,</hi> leſt the ambiguity of the word <hi>cunei</hi>
ſhould make it be applied to the military <hi>cunei,</hi> or wedges of men.</p>
                  <p>4. In Juſtin, lib. xxviii. c. 2. we read <q>That the Romans could not ſave
their city from the Gauls; and when it was taken, inſtead of defending it
by the ſword, had ranſomed it with money.</q> If this paſſage required,
or admitted emendation, there is no correction I would adopt more willingly
than yours, which, inſtead of <hi>captamque,</hi> ſubſtitutes <hi>capitoliumque.</hi> Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferus
objects, without reaſon, that a city <hi>captam,</hi> taken, cannot properly be
ſaid <hi>defendi ſerro,</hi> to be defended with the ſword; for the Roman hiſtorians
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0112200701:351"/>
agree that their city, when taken, was defended, though in a cowardly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Oroſius, among others, ſays, lib. xi. c. 19. <q>The Gauls penetrated
into the open city; Rome was now taken; the reſt of the youth were
ſhut up and <hi>beſieged</hi> in the citadel of the Capitoline Mount; where they
were a prey to hunger, peſtilence, terror, and deſpair.</q> You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
therefore, that though the city was taken, its defence was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
abandoned; and if it had not been taken, it needed not to have been
ranſomed. It ſeems not to have occurred to you, that your correction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the Capitol only to have been ranſomed, which is not hiſtorically true.</p>
                  <p>5. In Juſtin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. we read, <q>Ambaſſadors were firſt ſent by the
Roman ſenate to perſuade Antiochus, King of Syria, that he ſhould not
make war on the cities of Caele-Syria, which the Egyptians had occupied
in the former war, and which were therefore ſubject to Egypt; uſing with
him this argument, that theſe cities belonged to a young prince, their
pupil, who had been committed by his father to the protection of the
Romans.</q> This ſame Author, lib. xxx. c. iii. ſays, <q>M. Lepidus was
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0112200701:352"/>
ſent into Egypt to govern that kingdom, with the title of tutor to the
young king. A ſecond embaſſy was ſent, after Antiochus had taken
poſſeſſion of theſe cities, demanding that they ſhould be reſtored; and
without making any mention of the pupil king, merely on this ground,
that theſe cities belonged to the Romans by the right of war. <bibl>Juſtin,
lib. xxxi. c. 1.</bibl>
                     </q> What this right of war is, in contradiſtinction both to war
itſelf, and to conqueſts made by war, appears from the two following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
the firſt of which is part of Quintus Flamininus's ſpeech to the tyrant
Nabis, in Livy, lib. xxxiv. c. 32: <q>By what meaſures is the friendſhip
between ſtates violated? Principally by theſe two; when you treat with
hoſtility our allies, and when you make alliance with our enemies. Are
not you guilty of both, ſince you, through our ally, have ſeized, by arms
and violence, Meſſené, a city as much our ally as Lacedemon itſelf; and
ſince you have entered into an alliance with Philip our enemy?</q> The
other paſſage is in Florus, lib. iii. c. 5. <q>The King (Mithridates) did
not conſider Aſia as a country not belonging to him; but as it had been
formerly taken from him by violence, he ſought to recover it by the law
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0112200701:353"/>
of war.</q> I need not mention that "the law of war," in Juſtin, may have
a reference to both the circumſtances by which friendſhip between ſtates is
violated; but principally to the attack made on the dominions of Ptolemy,
an ally of the Romans, who deſire him to be reinſtated by Antiochus in
his poſſeſſions; for the author immediately adds, that when Antiochus refuſed
to comply, war was denounced againſt him.</p>
                  <p>6. In Juſtin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. we read, <q>The ſenate, therefore, wrote to
Flamininus, that if it ſeemed expedient to him, as he had delivered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon
from Philip, ſo he ſhould deliver Greece from Nabis.</q> The glory
of Flamininus, the general in the Macedonian war, is ſufficiently atteſted
by the words of the ſenate's decree, in Livy, lib. xxxiii. c. 32. <q>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and Roman people, and L. Quintius the general, having conquered
king Philip and the Macedonians, declare free and independent republics,
the Corinthians,</q> &amp;c. Florus, lib. ii. c. 12. ſays, <q>Perſeus ſucceeded his
father Philip, and did not think it becoming the dignity of Macedon, that it
ſhould remain in ſubjection, in conſequence of being defeated in one war.</q>
You aſk, whether Quintius, who conquered Macedon, can be ſaid, in any
ſenſe, to have delivered it from Philip, although it appears that Philip was
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0112200701:354"/>
really not deprived of that kingdom? and whether, if the Roman general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Nabis, as he had already conquered Philip, he did not thereby free
Greece? Theſe difficulties are ſolved by Juſtin, lib. xxx. c. 4. <q>The
fortune of the Romans conquered the Macedonians; ſo that Philip, after
his defeat, having obtained peace from the conſul Flamininus, preſerved
indeed the name of king, but kept poſſeſſion only of Macedon, having
loſt all thoſe cities of Greece, which, like ſcattered members of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian
kingdom, lay beyond its ancient boundaries.</q> In the letters,
therefore, of the Roman ſenate to the conſul Flamininus, Marcedon ſignifies
not the country ſtrictly ſo called, which alone was not taken from Philip,
but that part of Greece which lay beyond the original limits of Macedon;
to which is oppoſed the reſt of Greece, which was then haraſſed by Nabis,
but which had never been ſubject to Macedon. Hence the meaning of the
ſenate appears to have been, that Quintius, as he had delivered Macedonia,
that is, the part of Greece belonging to Macedon, from Philip, ſo he ſhould
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0112200701:355"/>
deliver the reſt of Greece from Nabis, who had actually made himſelf maſter
nearly of the whole of that country.</p>

emendation, and diligent in claſſical ſtudy, that they may perceive
what vaſt application this critical art requires, and how raſhly thoſe behave,
who immediately alter a paſſage which they do not at firſt ſight underſtand,
or which ſeems to them inconſiſtent with their rules of grammar or logic.
This raſhneſs is juſtly reprehended by many, and particularly by the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Burman, in his valuable preface to Phaedrus; which, as I have always
made it the rule by which my own critical labours have been directed, ſo I
would warmly recommend it to all thoſe who purſue the ſame walk of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0112200701:356"/>
Having made this preparatory obſervation, I proceed to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in Juſtin, about which ſo much learning has been employed.</p>
                     <p>1. The emendation of the manifeſtly corrupt paſſage in lib. ii. c. 3. § 18.
(a corruption depending on numbers, and therefore as natural as frequent,)
which corrects the error by changing fifteen hundred into fifteen, muſt be
approved by all judicious critics. The cauſe which introduced the faulty
reading into the text is uncertain; and the queſtion that has been ſo induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly
agitated concerning it, appears to me more curious than uſeful, ſince
the error might have originated in a thouſand different fources. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
reading runs thus: "Aſia was tributary to the Scythians fifteen hundred
years." We agree that it ſhould be corrected thus: "Aſia was tributary
to the Scythians fifteen years." But in the corrupt text you think that
obſcure traces of the genuine reading may be diſcerned, and imagine that
<hi>per mille</hi> had crept into the text, inſtead of <hi>permiſſa;</hi> explaining the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
as if "Aſia had been permitted to be tributary to the Scythians for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years." I obſerved that this emendation, for which I ſee not any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
is rendered highly improbable, becauſe in ancient manuſcripts the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0112200701:357"/>
names of numbers are expreſſed, not by words, but by letters uſed as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meral
marks; and though they are ſometimes expreſſed by words, yet this
is not frequent, eſpecially in works of hiſtory. This aſſertion is confirmed
by innumerable teſtimonies; I ſhall be contented with referring to that of
Galen de Antidot. I.—It is a ſubject indeed both of ſurpriſe and grief, that
this part of criticiſm, which conſiſts in aſcertaining exactly the rules of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meral
notation, ſhould not have met with due attention; although thereby
the raſhneſs of wild conjecture would be greatly reſtrained, and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
might be attained in determining the age and authenticity of manuſcripts.
But let it be ſuppoſed that your correction were ſafe on this ſide, yet it
would be deſtroyed by the paſſage which you yourſelf quote from Juſtin;
<q>That Seſoſtris being put to flight by the Scythians, left behind him his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0112200701:358"/>
army and baggage.</q> The hiſtorian having obſerved, in § 15, that the
Scythians, after returning from the purſuit of the king, rendered Aſia,
which they had ſubdued, tributary; how is it poſſible that, in § 18, he
ſhould ſay that this happened not in conſequence of their own military ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
but in conſequence of the permiſſion of Seſoſtris? We are not now
inquiring what is hiſtorically true, but what is Juſtin's report; which muſt
not be ſuppoſed inconſiſtent with itſelf.</p>
                     <p>2. If we here conſult Arrian, he tells us merely that <q>Alexander pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the river Hyphaſis, with a view to conquer the Indians who
lived beyond it; but that the Macedonians, then perceiving there was
no end to their labours, refuſed to advance; and finally prevailed on
Alexander, through the earneſt intreaty of Coenus, to prepare for his
return; ſince every thing ſeemed adverſe to his farther progreſs. Then
Alexander erected twelve great altars, as monuments of his conqueſts.</q>
Arrian ſays nothing about the Cuphites, the camp, or the two hundred
thouſand horſemen, who ſo much terrified the Macedonians. Curtius
lib. ix. c. 2 and 3, relates, <q>that Alexander, when he came to the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0112200701:359"/>
diſcovered that the farther bank was inhabited by the Gangaridae
and Pharraſii; that their king, with twenty thouſand horſe and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand foot, meant to obſtruct his paſſage; being furniſhed beſides
with two thouſand chariots and three thouſand elephants; which laſt formed
the moſt alarming part of his ſtrength. The Macedonians then refuſed
to follow the king farther; and obtained, through Coenus' entreaty, that
preparations ſhould be made for their return home.</q> He ſubjoins;
<q>Alexander came forth on the third day, and ordered twelve altars of
ſquare ſtone to be erected as a monument of his expedition, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
of his camp to be enlarged, and beds of a gigantic ſize to be
conſtructed, that by diffuſing an air of vaſtneſs on every object around
him, he might excite the credulous wonder of poſterity.</q> Plutarch,
in his treatiſe concerning the fortune of Alexander, ſpeaks to the ſame
purpoſe. By comparing theſe authors with Juſtin, the reader will perceive
that he differs from them all in ſeveral eſſential circumſtances; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in ſaying that Alexander had two motives for enlarging the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of his camp; one of which regarded the enemy, and the other had
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0112200701:360"/>
a relation to poſterity. <q>Moved by ſuch juſt prayers, he ordered a camp to
be built more magnificent than uſual, as at the end of his victory; that its
fortifications might be an object of terror to the enemy, and of admiration
to poſterity. <bibl>Juſtin, <hi>ibid.</hi> § 16.</bibl>
                        </q> The other hiſtorians are totally ſilent
as to what regards the enemy; which is favourable to that reading of Juſtin
which on the faith of manuſcripts ſtands in his text, and extremely adverſe
to your emendation. For "the end of his victory" muſt refer to ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
victory, and not to his victories in general; otherwiſe Juſtin, as you
acknowledge, would have ſaid, "the end of his victories," as in § 10.
above, "wearied, not leſs by the number of his victories, than by his
toils." As to Alexander's ſecond motive, concerning which all other
hiſtorians are ſilent, "that his fortifications might be an object of terror to
the enemy;" there would not ſurely be any room for it, on the ſuppoſition
that he had determined to move his camp, and leave the country, without
fighting a battle. The Cuphites could not be ſeized with alarm at ſeeing
the monuments of the exploits of a man who had not ventured to engage
with their army; nor, on that ſuppoſition, would there be any mention of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0112200701:361"/>
victory, terror, or ſacrifices of thanks; for that the word <hi>gratulatio</hi> refers
to the ſolemn victims ſacrificed in gratitude for ſucceſs, and frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by Arrian, cannot be doubtful to thoſe converſant with ancient writers.
Beſides, the word <hi>omiſſis</hi> including the idea of ſomething begun or neglected,
does not pleaſe me, nor ſeem conformable with Juſtin's ſtyle. Your prolix
diſcuſſion concerning the age, deſign, and character of Oroſius has but little
connection with the preſent ſubject. It is univerſally acknowledged, that he
ſo cloſely, or rather ſuperſtitiouſly, follows Juſtin's footſteps, that he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
expreſſes himſelf in the ſame words and phraſes; and it has long
ago been proved by good critics, that Juſtin's text, ſuch as it ſtood in the
copy uſed by Oroſius, may in innumerable places be reſtored by an attention
to the latter writer. He muſt be blind indeed, who does not perceive that
in the paſſage before us Oroſius muſt have copied Juſtin. Whence could he
otherwiſe have derived the name <hi>Choſidum,</hi> or <hi>Cuphitum,</hi> which is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by any other hiſtorian? and if that be the caſe, Oroſius muſt have
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0112200701:362"/>
found in his original, not that "the enemy were omitted," but that "they
were beat;" in which ſenſe Juſtin ought to be interpreted.</p>
                     <p>4. I grant that a town taken by a ſiege cannot be ſaid to be defended by
its own walls. But may it not be defended by troops in the citadel? When
the enemy are obliged to raiſe the ſiege of the citadel, the town may thereby
be delivered from all danger. The expreſſion, at leaſt, might be uſed by
an author fond of antitheſis and amplification.</p>
                     <p>5. Your new conjecture concerning the towns of Syria which the Romans
acquired by the law of war, would ſolve the difficulty, were not that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
built on an anachroniſm. For the league entered into with the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
of Antiochus, who came to crave peace, which you find in Livy,
lib. xxxviii. c. 37. was not prior, but ſubſequent, to Antiochus's expedition
into Egypt, mentioned in Juſtin, lib. xxxi. c. 1. You may conſider whether
the following words of Livy do not refer to this ſubject: <q>After this,
Quintius and his ten lieutenants received the ambaſſadors of kings,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0112200701:363"/>
nations, and cities. Thoſe of king Antiochus were firſt introduced.
They ſaid the ſame things as formerly, when at Rome, without gaining
belief; and they were now told, not in the ambiguous language which the
Romans had uſed before the defeat of Philip, and while their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was ſtill doubtful, but in expreſs terms, that Antiochus muſt evacuate
all the cities of Aſia, which had belonged either to Philip or to Ptolemy.</q>
Livy, lib. xxxiii. c. 34; with which compare c. 39 and 40. Be ſatisfied with
this authority. Farewell and proſper.</p>

                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0112200701:365"/>
You employ many arguments in defending your emendation of Juſtin,
lib. xii. c. 8. § 17; where, inſtead of "the enemy being bear," you ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
"the enemy being omitted." I formerly gave you my reaſons for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
this emendation, and ſhall not repeat them here, nor enter into a
particular diſcuſſion of the anſwers which you make to my objections. Thus
much only in general I will obſerve, that the reading in the text, which is
approved by the conſenting authority of the manuſcripts, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to contain a very natural meaning, conveyed in good Latin, and in
Juſtin's ſtyle. This reading, indeed, makes mention of a battle with the
Cuphites, concerning which the other hiſtorians of Alexander are ſilent.
But ought this ſilence to make us alter Juſtin's text, eſpecially as none of
thoſe hiſtorians deny ſuch a battle to have happened? If ſuch licence be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0112200701:366"/>
indulged to critics, that they may expunge or alter the words of an hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriam,
becauſe he is the ſole relater of a particular event, we ſhall leave
few materials for authentic hiſtory. Two reaſons ſtrongly militate againſt
your correction: the firſt, that if it be admitted, there will no longer be any
conſiſtency in Juſtin's narrative; and the whole clauſe muſt be expunged
which mentions the return of the Macedonians into their camp; which, if
they did not mean to fight, it was not neceſſary for them to leave. The
ſecond reaſon is, that the phraſe <hi>omittere hoſtes,</hi> though frequently uſed by
Juſtin, is never, that I know, applied by him in the ſenſe which you give
to it. The generals entitled to direct military meaſures are ſaid <hi>omittere
hoſtes;</hi> but never the ſoldiers, whoſe duty it is to obey orders; and who, in
the paſſage under conſideration, requeſt that they may not be ordered to
renew the engagement with the enemy. To this may be added, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this phraſe, <hi>omiſſis hoſtibus,</hi> occurs in Juſtin, it denotes not an end, but
only a change, of the war. Turn to the paſſage which you formerly referred
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0112200701:367"/>
to, lib. xxvii. c. 3. § 6. <q>They left off fighting againſt their foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and made war on each other:</q> to which you will find a parallel in
lib. xxix. c. 2. § 7. <q>By this oration he prevailed with Philip to leave
off fighting againſt the Etolians, and to make war on the Romans.</q> But
it is ſufficient that Oroſius read <hi>caeſis hoſtibus</hi> in the copies of Juſtin which
he made uſe of. If, by ſaying <hi>omiſſis hoſtibus,</hi> Oroſius confirmed your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
the reading in the text would be doubtful indeed.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing farther to add to my obſervations concerning the cities of
Syria which the Romans acquired by the right of war.</p>
                  <p>That we may not harp on the old ſtring, but have new matter for our
friendly conteſt, you raiſe a difficulty concerning the firſt conſulſhip of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caeſar; which happened on the firſt of January, in the ſix hundred and
ninety-fifth year of Rome, and in the forty-firſt of his age; although by
the laws aſcertaining the age of candidates, no perſon was entitled to crave
that honour before his forty-third year. But this law, which was propoſed
by Villius, appears not, any more than other laws appertaining to the ſame
object, to have been of perpetual authority; as we learn, both from the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0112200701:368"/>
Roman hiſtorians and from the conſular Faſti. Livy, lib. viii. c. 4, ſays, that
in the conſulſhip of C. Marius Rutilus and Q. Servilius Ahala, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by a law of the people, that no perſon ſhould bear the ſame magiſtracy
twice in the ſpace of ten years. But this law ſeems either not to have been
confirmed, or not to have remained in force: for we afterwards find both in
the Falti and in Livy, that T. Manlius Torquatus was a ſecond time conſul
in the ſpace of four years; M. Valerius Corvus, in eight; and L. Papirius
Craſſus, in ſix: L. Papirius Curſor was four times conſul in eight years:
which things are inconſiſtent with this law. To this ſubject may be referred
what Dio Caſſius ſays concerning another law of the ſame kind, in his fortieth
book, ſect. 56. <q>Pompey reſtored the law of the Comitia, which prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
any perſon from being elected into any office of magiſtracy in his
abſence; a law which had fallen into total diſuſe; and confirmed another,
which had been a ſhort time before enacted by the ſenate, forbidding any
man who had been a magiſtrate in the city to command in any foreign
province before the expiration of five years. Yet Pompey, who had juſt
paſt theſe laws, was not aſhamed to accept his command in Spain for five
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0112200701:369"/>
years longer; and to grant, by the ſame decree, to Caeſar (whoſe friends
impatiently brooked ſuch regulations) the permiſſion of being candidate
for the conſulſhip in his abſence, &amp;c.</q> That the law propoſed by Villius
was not uniformly obſerved, appears from Cicero's oration againſt Rullus;
where the orator boaſts that he was the firſt man, not graced by ancient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilty,
who had obtained the conſulſhip in the year that he was entitled to
ſolicit it: but this paſſage does not inform us what was the force of Villius's
law, when the candidates were patricians of ancient family, or men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular
dignity. Dolabella certainly, after Caeſar's murder, ſeized the conſulſhip,
when only twenty-five years old, as we are informed by Appian: on which
ſubject Dio Caſſius, lib. xliv. § 22, ſays, that Dolabella intruded himſelf
into the conſulſhip, though in nowiſe belonging to him; and Suetone inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates,
that Julius obtained ſomething to which he was not by law entitled.
<q>As the Comitia were already proclaimed, his demand could not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, unleſs he entered the city as a private perſon; and many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0112200701:370"/>
his being indulged with any favour to which he was not legally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled,
he choſe to poſtpone his claim to a triumph, leſt he ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the conſulſhip. <bibl>Sueton. lib. i. c. 18.</bibl>
                     </q> Nearly to the ſame
purpoſe Anthony, in Caeſar's funeral oration, in the forty-fourth book of Dio
Caſſius, ſays, <q>For this reaſon, (his ſucceſs in Spain,) you granted to him
a triumph, and immediately appointed him conſul. In the urgency of
his affairs he poſtponed his triumph; and accepting the conſulſhip,
thanked you for that honour, which he thought ſufficient for his own glory.</q>
It is therefore plain, that by deferring his claim to a triumph, he obtained
the conſulſhip, though a year younger than the age required for holding
that office. Had the Romans intended to enforce againſt him the Villian
law, there would not have been any reaſon to withhold from him the honour
of a triumph.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould willingly admit your remarks, though written in French, on
Salchlini's little work, into the <hi>Muſeum Helveticum,</hi> were not that publication
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0112200701:371"/>
interrupted at preſent; and it is uncertain when the printer will be allowed,
or will have inclination, to publiſh a new volume.</p>

                  <p>CHEZ les Romains, ce peuple généreux, qui nous a laiſſé tant de
choſes à admirer et à imiter, les vieux juriſconſultes, que leurs
longs travaux avoient rendus les oracles du barreau, ne ſe croyoient
pas inutiles à la république, lorſqu'ils cherchoient à développer, à
former des talens naiſſans, et à ſe donner de dignes ſucceſſeurs. Je
voudrois la rétablir cette coutume excellente, et la tranſporter même
dans les autres ſciences. Quiconque cannoît tant ſoit peu vos
ouvrages et votre réputation, ne vous refuſera pas, je penſe, le titre
d'un des premières littérateurs du ſiecle, et je ne crois pas qu'une
folle préſomption m'égare, lorſque je m'attribue quelques diſpoſitions
à réuſſir dans les Belles Lettres. Votre commerce pourroit m'être
d'une grande utilité. Voilà mon ſeul titre pour vous le demander.
Dans l'eſpérance qu'il pourra vous engager à me l'accorder, je vais
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0112200701:373"/>
vous demander des éclairciſſemens ſur quelques difficultes, et des dé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions
ſur quelques conjectures qui ſe ſont offertes à mon eſprit.</p>
                  <p>1. Qui étoit ce Piſon le Pere, à qui Horace addreſſe ſon art
poétique? M. Dacier croit que c'étoit ce L. Piſon le pontife qui tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompha
pour ſes exploits en Thrace, et qui mourut préfet de la Ville
A. U. C. 785<note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. vi. c. 10. Flor. Hiſt. Rom. L. iv. c. 12. T. Liv. Epitom. L. c.</note>. Mais il eſt évident que ce ne fut point lui. Horace
écrivit ſon art poétique avant l'an 734, puiſqu'il y parle de Virgile, qui
mourut dans cette année, d'une façon à faire bien comprendre qu'il
étoit encore vivant<note n="†" place="bottom">Horat. Art. Poet. v. 55.</note>. Or dans un autre endroit du même art poé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. v. 366.</note>,
il s'addreſſe à l'ainé des fils de ce Piſon comme à un jeune
homme qui avoit l'eſprit dejà formé.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"O major juvenum, quamvis et voce paternâ</l>
                     <l>"Fingeris ad rectum et per te ſapis."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Ce qui ne peut guères convenir qu'à un jeune homme de dix huit, à
vingt ans. Mais ce L. Piſon ne pouvoit point avoir dans ce tems la
un fils auſſi agé. Il mourut en 785, agé de quatre vingt ans<note n="§" place="bottom">Tacit. ubi ſupra.</note>. Il
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0112200701:374"/>
naquit donc en 705, et il n'avoit que trente ans tout au plus, quand
cette épitre fut écrite. Je vois aſſez clairement, que ce ne pouvoit pas
être là le Piſon que nous cherchons; mais, parmi un aſſez grand
nombre de perſonnages du ſiecle d'Auguſte qui portoient ce nom, je
voudrois qu'on m'aidat à trouver celui ſur qui les ſoupçons peuvent
tomber avec quelque vraiſemblance.</p>
                  <p>2. Vous ſavez combein les critiques ſe ſont donnés de peine, pour
rechercher le vrai but qu'avoit Horace dans la troiſième ode du troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſième
livre. La grandeur des idées, et la nobleſſe des expreſſions y
font ſentir partout la main de maître: mais on eſt à la fois faché et
ſurpris d'y voir que le commencement ne ſe lie point avec la ſuite,
que la harangue de Junon paroît ne tenir à rien, et n'aboutir à rien;
et après avoir admiré cette ode par parties, on ne peut guères s'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pêcher
d'en condamner l'enſemble. Taneguy le Fevre l'avoit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliquée
par un ſyſtême que M. Dacier trouve mériter autant d'éloges
que l'ode elle même, et qui en effet me paroît des plus jolis. Vous
ſavez qu'il le fonde ſur la crainte qu'il prête au peuple Romain de
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0112200701:375"/>
voir transférer à Ilium le ſiege de l'empire; et qu'il ſuppoſe qu'Horace
compoſa cette ode dans la vue de détourner Auguſte de ce deſſein, en
lui rappellant tout la part que les Dieux avoient eu à la deſtruction de
cette ville, et combien le mortel qui oſeroit la rebâtir s'expoſeroit à
tout le courroux de ces mêmes Dieux. Le peuple pouvoit d'autant
plus facilement ſuppoſer ce deſſein à ce prince, que ſon pere adoptif
en avoit été ſoupcçonné<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. i. c. 79.</note>. Mais je doute que ce fyſtême puiſſe ſe
ſoutenir. Et on ne ſauroit jamais prouver ces craintes prétendues du
peuple Romain, qui ſon mêmes ſans vraiſemblance; Auguſte ſe
diſtingua toujours par les ſoins particuliers qu'il donna à la ville de
Rome, qui devoient raſſurer le peuple contre toutes les craintes d'une
pareille eſpece. On peut en voir le dêtail dans la vie d'Auguſte par
Suetone, c. 28, 29, 30. Je n'en marquerai que deux: il engagea la
plus part des grands à orner la ville, par des bâtimens ſuperbes<note n="†" place="bottom">Vell. Paterculus, L. ii. c. 89.</note>, et il
bâtit un Temple à Mars le Vengeur, où il ordonna que le ſénat s'aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleroit
toutes les fois qu'il ſeroit queſtion de guerres ou de tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omphes<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sueton. L. ii. c. 29.</note>.
Sont ce la les actions d'un homme qui ſonge à ſe faire
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0112200701:376"/>
une nouvelle capitale? L'exemple de ſon oncle ne pouvoit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clure;
ce fut vers la fin de ſa vie qu'il dut concevoir ce projet,
dans un tems où la proſperité l'avoit aveuglé et engagé dans mille
démarches folles et mal entendues, qu'Auguſte ſe piqua toujours
d'éviter avec ſoin. La ſage opiniâtreté avec laquelle il refuſa tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jours
la dictature, peut ſervir de preuve à ce que je dis<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. ii. c. 52. Vell. Patercul. L. ii. c. 89.</note>. Voila
les raiſons qui m'empêchent d'acquieſcer au ſyſtême de Taneguy le
Fevre. J'en ſuis faché, et je ne ſerai tout à fait content que lorſque
vous m'aurez fourni une autre explication de cette ode, plus ſolide
ſans doute, et qui en applanira également les difficultés.</p>
                  <p>3. Antiochus, roi de Syrie, avoit pris pluſieurs villes de la Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Syrie
et de la Paleſtine au jeune Ptolémée, alors ſous la tutelle des
Romains. Ceux ci prennent la défenſe de leur éleve, et ordonnent
au roi de Syrie de les rendre. Il mépriſe ces ordres, et les retient.
Sur quoi on lui envoye une ſeconde ambaſſade, laquelle laiſſant de
côté les prétenſions du jeune prince, lui ordonna de rendre des villes,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0112200701:377"/>
que le peuple Romain avoit acquiſes par le droit de la guerre, <hi>civitates
jure belli factas populi Romani.</hi> Ce ſont la les termes de Juſtin<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtin. L. xxx. c. 1.</note>,
qui nous jettent dans une difficulté embaraſſante. On ne conçoit pas
comment les Romains pouvoient avoir acquis des villes dans la Syrie,
et dans l'Egypte, puiſque, bien loin d'y avoir fait des conquêtes,
ils ne porterent leurs armes en Aſie que pluſieurs années après cette
époque. On connoît bien un traité qu'ils avoient fait avec les Rois
d'Egypte avant ce tems<note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. Liv. Epitom. L. iv. Eutrop. L. ii. Valer. Maxim. L. iv. c. 3.</note> mais c'étoit un pur traité d'alliance et
d'amitié qui ne fut précédé ni ſuivi d'aucune guerre. J'ai cru que
l'examen des autres hiſtoriens, qui ont raconté ces mêmes évenemens,
pouvoit jetter quelques lumières ſur un paſſage de Juſtin auſſi obſcur
que celui la. Mais Tite Live, qui parle pluſieurs fois <note n="‡" place="bottom">Tit. Liv. L. xxxiii. c. 34. 39, 40.</note> des négocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
par leſquelles les Romains tacherent de faire rendre à Ptolémée
les villes d'Aſie, qu'on lui avoit priſes, ne parle nulle part de ce droit
de la guerre en vertu duquel les Romains les demandoient. Le ſavant

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0112200701:378"/>
cette, difficulte, après avoir tenté en vain de la réſoudre, a
été obligé enſin de la laiſſer ſans explication.—Mais,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"Nil deſperandum, Teucro duce; et auſpice Teucro."</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>4. Un different que Scaliger et Iſaac Voſſius ont eu enſemble, ſur
la veritable époque de la mort du poëte Catulle, a fait beaucoup de
bruit dans la republique des lettres. Je n'ai point eu en main les
pieces du procès, ſavoir les éditions de Catulle de ces deux hommes
célebres; mais Bayle <note n="*" place="bottom">Bayle Dictionnaire Critique, art. Catulle.</note> nous a donné un extrait fort détaillé de leur
diſpute, y ajoutant ſés propres réflexiens. Je ſuis faché de ne pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir
pas remonter aux ſources; mais dans la néceſſité de me ſervir de
rapporteur, je n'en connoîs point de meilleur que Bayle.</p>
                  <p>Quoique deux habiles littérateurs ſe ſoient exercés ſur cette queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
je ſuis bien loin de la regarder commé parfaitement éclaircie.
Voſſius me paroît avoir trop avancé le mort du poëte, Scaliger l'a
certainement trop reculée. Catulle ne mourut pas bien ſurement
A. U. C. 696; mais il ne veçut pas non plus juſqu'aux jeux ſéculaires
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0112200701:379"/>
d'Auguſte A. U. C. 736. Prouvons ce que nous avons avancé, et
cherchons l'époque en queſtion, qui doit ſe trouver entre ces deux
années.</p>
                  <p>Catulle parle de la Grande Bretagne et de ſes habitans<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Catull. Carm. xi. &amp;c.</note>, or
Céſar fut le premier qui fit connoître cette iſle aux Romains<note n="†" place="bottom">Tacit. in Vit. Agricol. C. 13.</note>, et
Céſar y fit ſa première expédition en 698<note n="‡" place="bottom">Caeſar. Comm. L. iv. Dion. Hiſt. L. xxxix. p. 113.</note> Auſſi bien Catulle
parle t'il du ſecond conſulat de Pompée, qui tombe ſur la même
année<note n="§" place="bottom">Catull. Carm. cxi.</note> Il vivoit même encore en 706, puiſqu'il parle auſſi du con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulat
de Vatinius<note n="‖" place="bottom">Idem, lii.</note>. Je ne veux pas me ſervir des argumens de
Scaliger pour prouver qu'il fut ſpectateur des triomphes de Céſar,
parceque je ne les crois pas de bon alloi. Je me diſpenſerai d'exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner
en détail ſi les paroles <hi>paterna prima lancinata ſunt bona,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Idem, xxvii. ver. 29.</note>
conviennent mieux aux premières victoires de Céſar qu'aux der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nières,
parceque je crois qu'il n'y eſt queſtion ni des unes ni des
autres. Il n'y a qu'à lire cette épigramme avec quelque attention
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0112200701:380"/>
pour voir que Catulle s'addreſſe toujours à Céſar dans la ſeconde
perſonne:</p>
                  <q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Cinoede Romule, haec videbis et feres?</l>
                        <l>"Es impudicus, et vorax, et helluo."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <p>Pendantque Mamurra y paroît toujours dans la troiſième perſonne,
ce qui eſt le cas dans les lignes:</p>
                  <q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Parum expatravit? an parvum helluatus eſt?</l>
                        <l>"Paterna prima lancinata ſunt bona.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <p>Il n'y eſt donc nullement queſtion des diſſipations de Céſar, mais
de celle de Mamurra; et toutes les conſéquences qu'on en peut tirer
par rapport aux triomphes de celui la, ſont illégitimes<note n="*" place="bottom">Cependant ſi l'on avoit la curioſité de rechercher l'époque préciſe de la compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion de cette épigramme, un paſſage de Cicéron nous conduiroit à la fixer vers l'an 708. Car quoiqu'en diſe Bayle, on ne peut guères entendre ce paſſage que d'une piece ſaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique faite contre Mamurra; auſſi bien le ſavant Dr. Middleton a t'il embraſſé cette opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Il eſt inutile de dire que Catulle n'auroit jamais oſé compoſer cette épigramme contre Céſar alors tout puiſſant. Le clémence de Céſar envers ſes ennemis étoit aſſez connue; la façon même, dont les anciens parlent de la modération dont Céſar uſa envers le ſatyrique, ſemble ſuppoſer qu'il avoit alors la puiſſance en main, puiſqu'auparavant ſa clé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence auroit eu peu de mérite. Tacite<note n="(1)" place="bottom">Annal. L. iv. c. 34.</note> qui en parle, la fait conſiderer ſur le même pied que celle de Bibalculus. Or on ne peut pas douter qu'Auguſte ne fut ſouverain alors.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0112200701:381"/>
D'un autre côté, Catulle ne veçut pas juſqu'aux jeux ſéculaires
d'Auguſte, puiſqu'il mourut avant Tibulle. Ovide, dans l'élégie qu'il
ſit exprès ſur la mort de ce dernier, met Catulle parmi les poëtes, que
ſon ami devoit recontrer à ſa deſcente dans les Champs Elysées:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Si tamen a nobis aliquid niſi nomen et umbra</l>
                     <l>"Reſtat: in Elyſia Valle Tibullus erit.</l>
                     <l>"Obvius huic venias hederâ juvenilia cinctus</l>
                     <l>"Tempora, cum Calvo, docte Catulle tuo<note n="*" place="bottom">Ovid. Eleg. L. iii. 9.</note>."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Mais dans quel tems Tibulle mourut il? Une petite épigramme
de Domitius Marius nous l'apprend: le même jour, ou du moins la
même année, que Virgile:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Te quoque Virgilio comitem non aequa, Tibulle,</l>
                     <l>"Mors juvenem Campos miſit ad Elyſios<note n="†" place="bottom">V. Tibull. Carm. L. iv. c. 15.</note>."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Or perſonne n'ignore que Virgile mourut le 22 Septembre 734<note n="‡" place="bottom">Donat. in Vit. Virgil.</note>.
Il eſt donc clair que Catulle, déja mort dans ce tems la, ne vit point
les jeux ſéculaires qui ne ſe célébrerent qu'en 736.</p>
                  <p>Avançons plus loin, et diſons, que Catulle étoit déja mort avant
721. Je me fonde ſur le témoignage d'un hiſtorien contemporain,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0112200701:382"/>
ami de Cicéron<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. i. c. 55. Voſſ. de Hiſt. Latin. L. i. c. 24.</note> et de Catulle lui même<note n="†" place="bottom">Catull. Carm. i.</note>; en un mot de Cornelius
Nepos. Il faut le développer ce témoignage. Dans la vie d'Atticus,
que cet écrivain nous a laiſſée, parlant d'un certain L. Julius Calidius,
à qui Atticus rendit de grands ſervices, il ajoute pour le faire
mieux connoître, <hi>quem poſt Lucretii Catullique mortem, multo clegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimum
poetam, noſtram tuliſſe aetatem vere videor poſſe contendere</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Attici, c. 12.</note>.
Catulle étoit donc mort lorſque Nepos écrivit ce paſſage. Mais ne
pourroit on pas fixer le tems de ſa compoſition? très facilement:
de vingt deux chapitres qui compoſent cette vie d'Atticus dix huit
furent publiés de ſon vivant. <hi>Hactenus Attico vivo haec a nobis edita
ſunt</hi>
                     <note n="§" place="bottom">Idem, c. 18.</note> 'Le paſſage, où il eſt parlé de la mort de Catulle, ſe trouve
dans le douzième chapitre; d'où il s'enſuit que Catulle mourut avant
Atticus. Mais celui ci finit ſa vie ſous le conſulat de Cn. Domitius
et de C. Soſius<note n="‖" place="bottom">Idem, o. 21.</note>. Si l'on vouloit pouſſer l'exactitude encore plus
loin, et qu'on eût envie de déterminer l'année préciſe de la mort
de notre poëte, on ne ſe tromperoit pas de beaucoup en prenant
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0112200701:383"/>
l'année moyenne entre A. U. C. 706 et 721; ce qui nous donnera
714, époque qui quadre fort bien avec tout ce que nous en ſavons
d'ailleurs.</p>
                  <p>Le ſeul argument de Scaliger, qui pourroit embarraſſer, eſt celui
qu'il tire du poëme ſéculaire que Catulle doit avoir compoſé. La con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture

                  <p>AMONG the Romans, that generous people, who had ſo many inſtitutions
worthy of being admired and imitated, the moſt reſpectable old lawyers,
whoſe long labours had rendered them the oracles of the bar, did not think
their time uſeleſs to the community, when it was employed in forming the
talents of youth, and in providing for themſelves worthy ſucceſſors. This
excellent cuſtom ought to be adopted, and extended to other ſciences. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

the title of one of the moſt learned men of the age; and I hope that my

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0112200701:373"/>
ſome difficulties that I have met with, and your opinion of ſome conjectures
that have occurred to my mind.</p>
                  <p>1. Who was that Piſo, the father, to whom Horace addreſſes his Art of
Poetry? Mr. Dacier ſuppoſes him to have been the high-prieſt who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a triumph for his exploits in Thrace, and who died praefect of the city
in the ſeven hundred and eighty-fifth year of Rome<note n="*" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. vi. c. 10. Flor. Hiſt. Rom. L. iv. c. 12. T. Liv. Epitom. L. c.</note>. But that could not be
the man; for Horace's Art of Poetry was written before the year ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty-four, ſince it makes mention of Virgil (who died that year)
in terms which ſhew that he was ſtill alive<note n="†" place="bottom">Horat. Art. Poet. v. 55.</note>: and in another part of the
poem<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. v. 366.</note>, Horace addreſſes the eldeſt of Piſo's ſons, as a young man of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
talents; which implies that he was not leſs than eighteen or twenty
years of age. But L. Piſo, the high-prieſt, could not ſurely have a ſon ſo old.
He himſelf died at the age of fourſcore<note n="§" place="bottom">Tacit. ubi ſupra.</note>, in the ſeven hundred and eighty-fifth
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0112200701:374"/>
year of Rome. He was born, then, in ſeven hundred and five; and was not
above thirty when the Art of Poetry was written. It is clear therefore, that he
is not the perſon to whom Horace writes; but, among the number of other
men who bore that name, I wiſh that you would help me to diſcover the
Piſo to whom that poem was moſt probably addreſſed.</p>
                  <p>2. You know how much trouble it has coſt the critics to find out Horace's
true deſign in the third ode of his third book. This maſterly performance
is diſtinguiſhed by greatneſs of thought and dignity of expreſſion; but we
are ſurpriſed and grieved to find, that the end does not correſpond with the
beginning; and that Juno's ſpeech is totally unconnected with what precedes
or follows it; ſo that after admiring the detached parts of this ode, we are
forced to condemn it as a whole. Taneguy le Fevre explained it by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
which Dacier thinks deſerving of as high encomiums as the ode
itſelf; and which is, doubtleſs, very ingenious. You know that his expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
turns on the ſuppoſed dread of the Romans, leſt the ſeat of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0112200701:375"/>
ſhould be removed to Troy; and that he fancies the ode to have been
written with a view to divert Auguſtus from ſuch a deſign, by ſhewing him
how earneſtly the Gods had co-operated towards the deſtruction of Troy,
and how much their refentment would be provoked by an attempt to rebuild
that ill-fated city. The people might the more naturally ſuſpect Auguſtus
of ſuch an intention, becauſe it was thought to have been entertained by his
adoptive father<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. i. c. 79.</note>. But this conjecture, I fear, will not bear examination. It
is impoſſible to prove thoſe pretended fears of the Romans; which are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
highly improbable, when we conſider that Auguſtus was remarkable
for his affectionate partiality towards Rome; as may be ſeen in his Life, by
Suetonius, c. 28, 29, 30. I ſhall mention but two examples of it. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
almoſt all the great men of Rome to adorn the city by ſuperb edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices<note n="†" place="bottom">Vell. Paterculus, L. ii. c. 89.</note>;
and himſelf erected a temple to Mars the Avenger, where the ſenate was
ordered to aſſemble during its deliberations concerning wars and triumphs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sueton. L. ii. c. 29.</note>.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0112200701:376"/>
Theſe are not the actions of a man who wiſhed to found a new capital. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his uncle is not applicable; that project was formed by him towards
the end of his life, when he was intoxicated by proſperity, and engaged in a
thouſand wild enterpriſes, which the prudence of Auguſtus carefully avoided.
The cautious firmneſs with which the latter prince always refuſed the office
of dictator, confirms my remark<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. ii. c. 52. Vell. Patercul. L. ii. c. 89.</note>. Such are the reaſons which hinder me
from acquieſcing in Le Fevre's explanation. I am ſorry for it, and will not
be eaſy till you ſupply me with another more ſolidly founded, and equally
well fitted to remove all difficulties.</p>
                  <p>3. Antiochus, king of Syria, had taken poſſeſſion of ſeveral cities in
Coele-Syria and Judaea, belonging to young Ptolemy, then under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Romans. That people undertake the defence of their pupil,
and order Antiochus to reſtore his towns. He deſpiſes their orders, and
keeps thoſe towns in his poſſeſſion; in conſequence of which, the Romans
ſend to him a ſecond embaſſy, which, without making any mention of young
Ptolemy's pretenſions, <q>claim thoſe towns as belonging to the Romans by
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0112200701:377"/>
the right of war.</q> Theſe are Juſtin's words<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtin. L. xxx. c. 1.</note>, which preſent us with a
very perplexing difficulty; becauſe we do not perceive how the Romans
could have acquired thoſe places by the right of war, ſince they were ſo far
from having made conqueſts in Aſia then, that they did not carry their arms
into that country till a later aera. A treaty indeed ſubſiſted between them
and the kings of Egypt<note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. Liv. Epitom. L. iv. Eutrop. L. ii. Valer. Maxim. L. iv. c. 3.</note>, but it was a treaty merely of friendſhip and alliance,
neither preceded nor followed by any war. I thought that an examination
of the other hiſtorians, who relate the ſame tranſactions, might throw light
on this obſcure paſſage of Juſtin. But Livy, who mentions ſeveral times<note n="‡" place="bottom">Tit. Liv. L. xxxiii. c. 34. 39, 40.</note> the
negociations by which the Romans endeavoured to recover for Ptolemy the
places taken from him by Antiochus, is altogether ſilent with regard to this
"right of war," in virtue of which they were demanded. I acquainted the
learned Mr. Breitinger, profeſſor of Greek at Zurich, with my difficulty on
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0112200701:378"/>
this ſubject; which, after attempting in vain to reſolve, he was obliged to
leave unexplained. But,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"Nil deſperandum, Teucro duce; et auſpice Teucro."</l>

                  <p>4. A difference of opinion between Scaliger and Iſaac Voſſius, concerning
the time of Catullus' death, made great noiſe in the republic of letters. I
have not at hand the original arguments of thoſe learned men, which are
contained in their reſpective editions of Catullus; but Bayle<note n="*" place="bottom">Bayle Dictionnaire Critique, art. Catulle.</note> has given us a
particular account of their diſpute, with his own reflections on the ſubject.
I am ſorry that I cannot draw from the fountain head; but Bayle's accuracy
as a compiler will not be diſputed.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the labours of theſe great ſcholars, I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the queſtion decided. Voſſius ſeems to me to place Catullus' death too
early, and Scaliger certainly fixes it at too late an aera. That poet ſurely did
not die in the year of the city ſix hundred and ninety-ſix; but neither did
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0112200701:379"/>
he live to ſee the ſecular games of Auguſtus celebrated in ſeven hundred and
thirty-ſix. Let us prove theſe aſſertions, and endeavour to find out the
true aera in queſtion, which muſt have been at an intermediate time between
the years juſt mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Catullus ſpeaks of Great Britain and its inhabitants<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Catull. Carm. xi. &amp;c.</note>, with which Caeſar firſt
made the Romans acquainted<note n="†" place="bottom">Tacit. in Vit. Agricol. C. 13.</note>, by his expedition thither, in the year of Rome
ſix hundred and ninety-eight<note n="‡" place="bottom">Caeſar. Comm. L. iv. Dion. Hiſt. L. xxxix. p. 113.</note>. Catullus alſo mentions the ſecond conſulſhip
of Pompey, which happened on that ſame year<note n="§" place="bottom">Catull. Carm. cxi.</note>. He lived ſo late as the
year ſeven hundred and ſix, ſince he ſpeaks of the conſulſhip of Vatinius<note n="‖" place="bottom">Idem, lii.</note>.
I will not make uſe of Scaliger's arguments to prove that the poet witneſſed
Caeſar's triumphs, becauſe I do not believe them well-founded. I will not
particularly examine whether the words <hi>paterna prima lancinata ſunt bona</hi>
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">Idem, xxvii. ver. 29.</note>,
beſt apply to the firſt or laſt victories of Caeſar, becauſe I do not believe
them to have any reference to the one or the other. We need only to read
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0112200701:380"/>
the epigram attentively, to perceive that Catullus always addreſſes Caeſar
in the ſecond perſon, and Mamurra in the third.</p>
                  <p>The poet alludes, therefore, not to Caeſar's diſſipation, but to that of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murra;
and all the conſequences deduced from his applying his words to the
former, are built on a falſe hypotheſis<note n="†" place="bottom">Were we curious to aſcertain exactly the date of this epigram, a paſſage of Cicero would lead us to fix it at the year 708. For, notwithſtanding Bayle's reaſonings, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not regard it in any other light than that of a ſatire written againſt Mamurra; an opinion embraced by the learned Dr. Middleton. There is no weight in the obſervation, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus would not have ventured to write this epigram againſt Caeſar in the plenitude of his power. Caeſar's clemency towards his enemies is well known; and the terms in which hiſtorians ſpeak of his lenity ſhewn to this ſatiriſt implies that he was then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of power to puniſh him; otherwiſe his moderation would have been of little value. Tacitus<note n="(1)" place="bottom">Annal. L. iv. c. 34.</note> ſpeaks of this affair as a parallel to that of Bibalculus, who ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed Auguſtus when the latter was certainly inveſted with ſovereign dominion.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="360" facs="tcp:0112200701:381"/>
Catullus, on the other hand, did not live to ſee the ſecular games cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by Auguſtus, ſince he died before Tibullus. Ovid, in an elegy
written on the death of the latter, places Catullus among the poets whom
his friend will meet with in the Elyſian fields<note n="*" place="bottom">Ovid. Eleg. L. iii. 9.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But when did Tibullus die? A little epigram of Domitius Marius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, that he died the ſame day, or at leaſt in the ſame year, with Virgil<note n="†" place="bottom">V. Tibull. Carm. L. iv. c. 15.</note>.
Now it is well known that Virgil died the twenty-ſecond of September ſeven
hundred and thirty-four<note n="‡" place="bottom">Donat. in Vit. Virgil.</note>. Catullus then could not ſee the ſecular games,
which were not celebrated till ſeven hundred and thirty-ſix.</p>
                  <p>We may go farther, and affirm, that Catullus was dead before the year
ſeven hundred and twenty-one. This is proved by a contemporary hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0112200701:382"/>
the friend of Cicero<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. i. c. 55. Voſſ. de Hiſt. Latin. L. i. c. 24.</note> and of Catullus<note n="†" place="bottom">Catull. Carm. i.</note>; I mean Cornelius Nepos. In
his Life of Atticus, ſpeaking of a certain Julius Calidius, to whom Atticus
had rendered very important ſervices, he diſtinguiſhes him, <q>as the moſt
elegant poet of that age, ſince the death of Lucretius and Catullus <note n="‡" place="bottom">Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Attici, c. 12.</note>.</q>
The latter, therefore, was dead before Nepos wrote this paſſage; of which
it is not difficult to fix the date. Nepos' Life of Atticus conſiſts of twenty-two
chapters; the firſt eighteen of which were, as he tells us, written while
the ſubject of them ſtill lived<note n="§" place="bottom">Idem, c. 18.</note>. The paſſage mentioning the death of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus
is in the twelfth chapter; from whence it follows, that Atticus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
Catullus. But Atticus died during the conſulſhip of Cn. Domitius
and C. Soſius<note n="‖" place="bottom">Idem, o. 21.</note>. Did we wiſh to aſcertain ſtill more accurately the preciſe
year of Catullus' death, we ſhould not be much miſtaken in fixing it at the
middle term between the years of Rome ſeven hundred and ſix, and ſeven
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0112200701:383"/>
hundred and twenty-one; which will give us the year ſeven hundred and
fourteen; which very well agrees with all other particulars known con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him.</p>
                  <p>The only argument adduced by Scaliger, that can occaſion any difficulty,
is, that Catullus compoſed a ſecular poem. Voſſius' conjecture, that the
ſecular games were celebrated at the commencement of the ſeventh century
of Rome, is altogether unwarranted: that of Bayle, I fear, reſts not on
much better authority. The beginning of that century was deformed by
ſo many diſorders, and by ſuch a marked neglect of ancient ceremonies<note n="*" place="bottom">Sueton. L. ii. c. 37.</note>,
that there is not any probability that ſuch games ſhould then have been
either exhibited or expected. But it is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus'
poem was written for the ſecular games. It might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
merely for Diana's feſtival, which was celebrated yearly in the month
of Auguſt; as Bentley conjectured<note n="†" place="bottom">Bentl. in Praefat. Edit. Horatian.</note>. This is confirmed by comparing this
poem with Horace's <hi>Carmen Seculare.</hi> In the former, both the boys and girls
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0112200701:384"/>
form but one chorus, which addreſſes itſelf to Diana<note n="*" place="bottom">Catull. Carm. xxxiv. ver. 1.</note>. In Horace, the boys
addreſs themſelves to Apollo, and the girls to Diana<note n="†" place="bottom">Horat. Carm. Secular. ver. 34.</note>. This diſtinction had
been eſtabliſhed by the oracle who commanded the celebration of the
games<note n="‡" place="bottom">V. Diſſertat. Cl. Turretin de Ludis Secular. p. 36.</note>.</p>

                  <head>Mr. GESNER to Mr. GIBBON.</head>
                  <p>1. YOU inquire who were the Piſos, of whom Horace ſpeaks in ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
terms in his Art of Poetry. Dacier and Sanadon would probably,
moſt learned Sir, have obtained more credit with you, had they cited the
authority on which their opinion reſts; and independently of which, it ſeems
no better than a gueſs, which a ſlight argument is ſufficient to overturn.
This authority is that of Porphyrio, an ancient writer, who treats of the
names mentioned in Horace, and who here perhaps copies from ſome author
more ancient than himſelf. In his corrected edition Porphyrio ſays, <q>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race's
work, intitled the Art of Poetry, is addreſſed to L. Piſo, who was
afterwards governor of Rome; for Piſo was himſelf a poet, and a patron
of literary purſuits.</q> But chronology, you ſay, does not warrant this
explanation. It does; for Tacitus tells us, in his Annals, (lib. vi. c. 10.)
that Piſo died U. C. 785, at the age of eighty. He held his office twenty
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0112200701:386"/>
years; and therefore entered on it U. C. 765; before which period Horace
muſt have ſent to him the Art of Poetry, (which I ſuſpect once ſtood at the
third epiſtle of the ſecond book,) becauſe Porphyrio ſays, <q>who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
governor of Rome.</q> Let us ſuppoſe that Piſo's ſon was born
when the father was thirty years old; and that the ſon was ſixteen when
Horace addreſſed him, <hi>O major juvenum;</hi> the Art of Poetry will then have
been written in the fifty-ſecond year of Horace's age; which well agrees
with Bentley's computation; a ſubject which I remember to have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and approved when about the ſame time of life I publiſhed my edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Horace. If we think ſixteen years too young for the praiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
by the poet, we may add to them five, or even ten years more.
But to this mode of reckoning it is objected, that Virgil was alive when
Horace wrote his Art of Poetry; and as the latter died in the year of
Rome ſeven hundred and thirty-five, Piſo, who was then but thirty years
old himſelf, could not have a ſon above ten or twelve at the utmoſt. But
ſome critics do not diſapprove of the application of <hi>juvenis</hi> to a boy of ten
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0112200701:387"/>
years, and of a forward genius: Grotius and others were poets at that age;
and the Roman courtiers would naturally, I think, be prodigal in uſing the
term <hi>juvenis,</hi> after Cicero gave ſo much offence by applying the term <hi>puer</hi>
to Auguſtus.</p>
                  <p>But I ſee not any convincing argument to prove that Virgil was alive
when the Art of Poetry was written. For, in the paſſage alluded to, Horace
does not contraſt living poets with thoſe that were dead, but ancient poets
with the modern; and, according to the critics whom he mentions, not
death alone, but the being dead a certain number of years, was neceſſary for
the attainment of poetical ſame.</p>

                  <bibl>See the firſt epiſtle of the ſecond book.</bibl>
                  <p>2. Concerning the third ode of the third book, I formerly gave my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the obſervations accompanying my edition, which, as you have not
ſeen them, I ſhall here repeat and explain. Auguſtus ſometimes repreſented
in ſport the ſuppers of the gods. We know from Suetone, lib. ii. c. 70.
that he was blamed for his imitation of the ſupper of the twelve gods, which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0112200701:388"/>
uſed to take place in the capitol, where pallets were ſpread for them; of
which we ſee an example in Livy, lib. xxii. c. 10. Is it not poſſible that
Horace, either with or without the orders of Auguſtus, might think proper
to write verſes adapted to ſuch a repreſentation? Might he not endeavour to
remove the blame attached to it, by exhibiting an example in which it was
not only innocent, but conformable with the inſtitutions and inclinations of
the Romans? At the ſame time his ode would be a compliment to the
Julian family? which had long boaſted its deſcent from Aeneas and Iülus. For
entering on this ſubject, the poet ingeniouſly prepares the way, by ſhowing
that men had attained divinity through juſtice and fortitude. Auguſtus is
entitled to our admiration and praiſe; and, as he ſung in another ode, written
nearly about the ſame time, <hi>preſens divus habebitur,</hi> being not leſs worthy of
divinity than Bacchus and Romulus; the latter of whom was not without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
admitted to that honour, <q>till Juno made her moſt pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
ſpeech in the council of the gods.</q> This ſpeech is of the ſame
purport with that in the Aeneid, lib. xii. v. 791. <hi>&amp; ſeq.;</hi> and might have
been pronounced with propriety, without ſuppoſing that Auguſtus ever ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
thought of changing the ſeat of his empire. That prince alſo muſt
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0112200701:389"/>
have been pleaſed with an attempt to perſuade the people that he condemned
a deſign, ſaid to have been entertained by Julius Caeſar, but which was ſo
much deteſted by the Romans, and would, if carried into execution, have
been ſo calamitous to Rome. The ſpeech indeed is longer, and more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
than might be expected from the beginning of the ode; but <hi>he</hi> muſt
be ignorant of the nature of lyric poetry, as illuſtrated in the writings of the
ancients, who finds fault with the length of this real or apparent digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>3. The knot muſt be hard indeed, which not only baffles the exertions of
a learned and ingenious youth, but reſiſts the ſtrength of Breitinger, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran
in the literary field, whoſe name I never pronounce but with the higheſt
reſpect. How could Roman ambaſſadors require that the cities taken by
Antiochus in Aſia ſhould be reſtored, according to the law of war, to Rome,
when the ſenate ſhortly before had declared thoſe cities to belong to its
pupil Ptolemy? Or how could the Romans claim thoſe cities by the law of
war, when Scipio, a few years afterwards, was the firſt Roman general that
paſſed into Aſia with an army? Livy, lib. xxxvii. The knot, however,
may be untied, without having recourſe to Alexander's ſword, provided we
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0112200701:390"/>
follow the ſeries of thoſe tranſactions, as related by Juſtin and Livy. The
latter hiſtorian, lib. xxxi. c. 14, relates, <q>that Philip's courage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by his league with Antiochus, king of Syria, with whom, as ſoon
as he learned Ptolemy's death, he purpoſed, according to the tenor
of that agreement, dividing the ſpoils of Egypt.</q> Juſtin, again, lib. xxx.
c. 2, tells us, <q>that the Alexandrians ſent ambaſſadors to Rome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting
the ſenate to defend the cauſe of their pupil, threatened with the
partition of his dominions, in conſequence of a treaty for that purpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Philip and Antiochus.</q> This treaty indeed ſoon began to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into effect; for, according to Livy, lib. xxxii. c. 19. <q>Antiochus,
while his ally was occupied in the war with Rome, conquered all the
cities belonging to Ptolemy in Coele-Syria; purpoſing next to invade
the coaſt of Caria and Cilicia, and at the ſame time to aſſiſt Philip with a
fleet and army.</q> Meanwhile Philip is conquered by the Roman conſul
Quintius; who then openly declared to Antiochus' ambaſſadors, <q>that their
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0112200701:391"/>
maſter muſt evacuate (ſupply, "according to the law of war,") all thoſe
cities to which either Philip or Ptolemy had any claims. <bibl>Livy, lib. xxxiii.
c. 34.</bibl>
                     </q> Juſtin's narrative, therefore, though obſcured by brevity, is yet
conſiſtent with truth.</p>
                  <p>Do you not repent, learned Sir, the having written to an indolent old
man, who could delay two months ſending an anſwer to a letter ſo obliging,
and ſo honourable to himſelf? I will not throw the blame on my advanced
age, though I begin to feel my former powers of exertion ſomewhat ſlacken
and abate under the weight of ſixty-ſeven years. At this time of life moſt
old men are indulged with a diminution of labour; whereas I, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
am continually burdened with an increaſe of occupations and cares.
I belong to ſeveral academies, particularly that of Berlin, and this here of
Gottingen; which laſt I am appointed to direct ſix months in the year; I
alſo preſide weekly in the German ſociety of this place, and frequently cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
with the Latin ſociety of Jena. I am entruſted with the care of
the public library, conſiſting at leaſt of fifty thouſand volumes; with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0112200701:392"/>
of the colleges in his majeſty's German dominions; and with the
ſuperintendance of about twenty youths, who are educated at the public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
The taſk alſo falls on me of writing whatever is inſerted in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
of the univerſity, in the name of the rector and ſenate: and it is my
duty to give daily three, four, and ſometimes more prelections. To theſe
public offices muſt be added the avocations of private company, and of a
very extenſive correſpondence. Beſides, I have always ſome work in hand,
which requires nicer attention to render it worthy of the public eye. At
preſent I am employed about an edition of Claudian; which, God willing!
ſhall be publiſhed in the courſe of this ſummer. Thus circumſtanced, I
confeſs that I laid aſide your letter, which ſeemed as if it would require more
pains to anſwer than were afterwards found neceſſary, until I ſhould enjoy a
few hours of uninterrupted leiſure. This opportunity occurred only yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
of which, you ſee, I made uſe.</p>
                  <p>It remains that I requeſt you to receive favourably this attempt; and if it
does not fully anſwer your expectation, to aſcribe the failure to any other
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0112200701:393"/>
cauſe rather than my want of inclination to oblige you. Brevity was my
aim, becauſe it ſeemed unneceſſary to repeat what you had ſo well ſaid on

                  <p>LA multitude de vos occupations montrent à la fois votre mérite,
la juſtice qu'on lui rend, ma préſomption, et votre bonté. Que
j'envie le ſort de ce petit nombre d'eſprits ſupérieurs dont les talens
toujours les mêmes, et toujours diverſifiés, revêtiſſent avec une égale
facilité tous les caractères que l'utilité ou l'agrément des hommes
exige d'eux. J'applaudis encore au diſcernement de ces princes qui
oſent écarter les nuages dont la frivolité, l'envie, et la calomnie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironnent
leurs trones, qui rendent aux grands hommes de leurs
états, une juſtice que le public impartial leur rendoit depuis long tems
et qui ſavent récompenſer leurs talens, en leur fourniſſant de nouvelles
occaſions de les développer. Voila une petite partie des réflexions
qu'a fait naitre votre lettre; ſi j'en croyois mon inclination, elles
n'auroient point de bornes; mais la raiſon me dit que je dois me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenter
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0112200701:397"/>
de vous aſſurer de toute la reconnoiſſance dont vous avez pé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nétré
un homme qui ſe fera toujours gloire du titre de votre diſciple.
Je vais dans peu de tems en Angleterre; je pourrois peut etre y
trouver l'occaſion de vous prouver mes ſentimens, ou du moins mon
commerce vous deviendra moins ennuyeux. Mon ſéjour dans une
capitale éclairée me donnera une ſorte de mérite local. Incapable de
les imiter, je vous apprendrai de bonne-heure les travaux, et les dé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couvertes
de nos ſavans. Gottingue mérite bien qu'à mon tour je
vous demande quelles ſont les occupations de vos collegues et de vos
diſciples. Un nouveau plaiſir que j'enviſage dans mon retour en Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre,
c'eſt la connoiſſance de tous vos ouvrages. Mon premier ſoin
ſera de me les procurer, et de les étudier comme mes meilleurs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dèles:
pour m'aider dans cette recherche, je prendrai la liberté de
vous demander une liſte de tous ces morceaux curieux dont vous avez
enrichi la république des lettres. Mon ignorance de pluſieurs d'entre
eux excite à la fois ma joye et ma honte. Ma jeuneſſe, et le lieu
d'où je datte mes lettres, ſont mon unique excuſe.</p>

Si j'oſe propoſer quelques nouveaux doures, vous ſavez mieux
que perſonne qu'il n'y a que la raiſon, ou du moins ſon apparence
que ſoit abſolue. Soyez perſuadé que mon unique but en diſcutant
vos leçons, c'eſt de m'en rendre digne:</p>

                  <p>Après cette explication, je vous avouerai qu'il me reſte encore quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
nuages ſur le Piſon de l'Art Poétique. Vous ne croyez pas que
les paroles d'Horace touchant Virgile, prouvent que ce poëte fût en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core
vivant, et que l'oppoſition eſt plutôt des anciens aux modernes,
que des mots aux vivans. J'ai relu l'endroit, mais cette nouvelle
lecture, et les réflexions aux quelles elle a donné lieu, n'ont fait que
me confirmer dans ma première opinion. Horace trouvoit la langue
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0112200701:399"/>
Latine pauvre et trop ſtérile, pour exprimer les idées abſtraites que
les compagnons de Romulus, les pâtres, et les brigands ne connoiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoient
point: pluſieurs de ſes compatriotes lui avoient trouvé le
même défaut. Horace ſouhaite de l'enrichir. Il propoſe pour cet
effet aux Virgile, aux Varius, de travailler dans ce deſſein, et d'em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prunter
du Grec quantité de termes énergiques dont ils avoient
beſoin. Il leur offre ſon ſecours. C'eſt un projet qu'il forme et non
une choſe déja faite qu'il juſtifie. Par conſéquent l'avenir qu'il envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
ne peut regarder que ceux d'entre les écrivains qui vivoient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core.
Par conſéquent l'Art Poétique fut compoſé avant l'an 735.
Le point de vue ſous lequel je conſidere ce paſſage, eſt ſi bien celui du
poëte lui même, que celui ci finit cette oppoſition par cette image
(une des plus vives et des plus juſtes, que je connoiſſe):</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"—licuit ſemperque licebit</l>

tems; le <hi>licebit,</hi> le futur, les Varius, les Virgile, ceux qui étoient
encore en état d'en profiter<note n="*" place="bottom">Cette explication eſt d'autant plus vraiſemblable, que dans ſes ouvrages, Virgile s'eſt plutôt piqué de faire revivre de vieux mots, que d'en emprunter de nouveaux du Grec. Je doute même qu'on puiſſe trouver un ſeul endroit où il ait ſuivi le conſeil d'Horace.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Mais, dites vous, dans ce tems même le jeune Piſon pouvoit
avoir dix ans; Grotius faiſoit bien des vers à cet age. Je le
ſais: mais les Grotius ſont ils bien communs; combien d'enfans
trouverez vous de dix ans, qui ayent non-ſeulement aſſez de feu pour
faire des vers, mais encore aſſez de réflexion pour en juger ſenſé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Il n'eſt pas même vraiſemblable qu'à l'age de vingt ans
Piſon le pere eût déja des enfans. Vous ſavez combien rares étoient
les mariages ſous Auguſte; combien l'exemple de Germanicus
paroiſſoit admirable<note n="‡" place="bottom">Suet. L. ii. c. 34.</note>; combien la pauvreté<note n="§" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. ii. c. 37.</note>, la debauche, et l'orgueil,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0112200701:401"/>
arretoient la nobleſſe dans le célibat, ſurtout pendant les guerres
civiles qui déſolerent la terre, pendant la première jeuneſſe de Piſon.
Les loix d'Auguſte ne font qu'indiquer la grandeur du mal<note n="*" place="bottom">Dion. Hiſt. Rom. L. lvi. p. 570.</note>, et les
premières de ces loix furent promulguées plus de trente ans aprés la
naiſſance de Piſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Horat. Carm. Secular. v. 17, &amp;c. Torrent de Lege Juliâ ad Calc. Horat. p. 75, &amp;c.</note>. Si l'on compte une génération ordinaire <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> à
trente trois ans<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herodot. L. ii. Newton Chronol. Emendat. p. 41.</note>, il paroît que ſous le commencement de l'empire,
on devroit les pouſſer plutôt juſqu'à quarante ans, que de les réduire
à vingt. Je conviens que ce ne ſont la que des probabilités, mais dans
la ſcience de la critique, il paroît que les probabilités doivent faire
diſparoître les poſſibilités, et céder à leur tour aux preuves. Je ne
crains rien de ce principe. L'autorité d'un Prophyrion n'a pas aſſez
de force parmi les ſavans, pour pouvoir jamais former un raiſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Tout ce qu'elle pourroit faire, ceſeroit d'en appuyer un déja
prouvé. Les anciens ne donnoient point à Porphyrion la première
place parmi les commentateurs d'Horace<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. Vitam Horat. ſine nomine Autoris.</note>, et les modernes, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0112200701:402"/>
Dacier ſurtout, lui ont trouvé beaucoup d' erreurs. Je ne
ſens pas d'ailleurs la force de la première de vos hypothèſes. Si
Piſon avoit eu ſon fils à l'age de trente ans, celui ci pouvoit en
avoir ſeize, lorſque Horace lui écrivit, age, ſuivant vous, qui repond
aux conditions requiſes. Auriez vous oublié dans ce moment qu' Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race
mourut en 745; quand Piſon lui même n'avoit que 40 ans?</p>
                  <p>2. Je ne doute pas un inſtant qu'Horace n'ait eu en vue, dans la troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſième
Ode du troiſième Livre, de faire voir aux Romains que ſi leur
prince aſpiroit aux honneurs divins, <hi>Viamque affectat Olympo,</hi> il les mé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoit
par ſes exploits, dont la grandeur égaloit celle des plus fameux
héros, d'un Bacchus, d'un Hercule, d'un Romulus, héros, qui mépriſant
les efforts des humains, et appaiſant la haine des Dieux, s'étoient frayé
un chemin juſq'aux palais des immortels. Mais a t'il voulu faire ceſſer
les clameurs du peuple ſur l'infame <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0112200701:403"/>
nous ſavons toujours que puiſque Marc Antoine la rapella dans les
lettres à ſon rival<note n="*" place="bottom">Suet. L. ii. c. 70.</note>. Elle arriva avant la dernière brouillerie des
triumvirs, ou avant l'an 721. Suivant Bentley<note n="†" place="bottom">Bentley in Praefat. ad Horat.</note> dont vous adoptez
les idées, Horace compoſa le troiſième livre des Odes dans la qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante
deuxième, et la quarante troiſième année de ſon age, c'eſt à dire,
en 728 et 729. Une juſtification venue ſept ou huit ans après coup,
bien loin de faire plaiſir à Auguſte n'auroit ſervi qu'à faire revivre
la mémoire de ces excès, que la politique du prince, et la reconnoiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
du peuple avoient plongé dans l'oubli. 2. Auguſte ſoupa avec
onze hommes, ou femmes, pareillement equippés en divinités. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race
élevoit bien Auguſte à la table des dieux, <hi>purpureo bibit ore
nectar;</hi> mais y placoit il auſſi tous ſes compagnon? L'honneur
ſeroit devenu bien banal, et un tel panégyrique n'eut pas été fort
éloigné de la ſatyre. Je conviens bien du reſte avec vous, que trouver
le plan d'un morçeau de poëſie Lyrique, eſt un but plus deſirable
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0112200701:404"/>
que néceſſaire. Les Lyriques ont toujours eu le privilege de prendre
un vol que l'imagination admire, et que la timide raiſon n'oſe criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.
Dans l'ode dont nous parlons, que ce défaut, ſi c'en eſt un,
eſt racheté par de grandes beautés! Les deux premières ſtrophes font
ſentir quel effet, l'union de la philoſophie avec la poëſie, peut produire:
le <hi>juſtum et tenacem propoſiti virum</hi> eſt le ſage des ſtoiciens, leur
roi<note n="*" place="bottom">Horat. Serm. L. i. Serm. iii. ver. 124.</note>, leur ſeul heureux. La juſtice formoit toutes ſes réſolutions;
une conſtance inébranlable le rendoit ardent à les ſuivre<note n="†" place="bottom">Cicero pro Murenae, c. 29. De la Mothe le Vayer, tom. i. p. 606, &amp;c. de la Vertu des Payens.</note>. Un
tel homme au deſſus des paſſions et des préjugés, n'y jettoit quelque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fois
les yeux que pour s'écrier,
<q>
                        <l>"O! curas hominum! O! quantum in rebus inane!"</l>
                     </q>
S'il eſt honteux pour l'eſpece humaine de n'avoir jamais produit cet
homme; il lui eſt bien honorable d'avoir ſu en former un tableau.
Quelle gradation dans les images! ſon ſage réſiſteroit aux clameurs
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0112200701:405"/>
d'une multitude forcenée. Mais la colère du peuple s'appaiſe avec la
même facilité qu'elle s'eſt allumée. Il mépriſeroit les menaces d'un
tyran furieux; mais les coeurs des tyrans ſe ſont quelquefois laiſſé
fléchir. Il entendroit ſans fremir le bruit des tempêtes ſourdes aux
cris des malheureux. Mais la fortune a ſouvent ſauvé les victimes à
la fureur des flots. Egal à Jupiter, il n'en craindroit par la foudre.
Içi l'imagination s'arrete en tremblant. Elle craint pour le poëte
une chute foible ou outrée; elle ne ſent point d'image ſupérieure au
courroux du maître des Dieux et des hommes. Avec quel étonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
admire t'elle le génie du poëte, quand elle lit, <q>Il recevra ſans
ſourciller le choc de l'univers écroulé, où une même deſtruction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voit
envélopper, les hommes, les élémens, et les Dieux eux mêmes<note n="*" place="bottom">Plin. L. vi. Epiſt. 20.</note>.</q>
Je m'arrete. Peut etre ces réflexions vous ennuyent: en ce cas,
c'eſt ma faute. J'aurai cependant rempli mon but qui étoit de faire
voir le point de vue ſous lequel je conſidere l'érudition la plus grande.

Comme moyen, elle mérite toute notre admiration; comme ſin der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nière,

                  <p>3. Vous connoiſſez, Monſieur, ce ſameux paſſage de Velleius Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus<note n="*" place="bottom">Vell. Patere. L. ii. c. 125.</note>,
qui a donné tant de peine aux ſavans. Le voici: <hi>Ita Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

en puiſſe tirer quelques ſens raiſonnable. Il faut abſolument le ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, ou inutile, ou corrompu. Auſſi tous les critiques, qui ont tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaillé
ſur cet auteur, ont ils eſſayé de le rétablir. Burerius, Acida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Grutar, Boeclerus, Heinſius, Burman, ont tous fourni des con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
plus ou moins vraiſemblables, mais que je ne me propoſe
pas de diſcuter. Il vaudra mieux, je crois, vous en offrir une de ma
façon, et vous laiſſer juge de ſon plus, ou moins de probabilité.
Au lieu de la leçon reçue, je lirai, <hi>Priſcâ antiquâque ſeveritate, FUSUS

voir qu'elle eſt des plus conformes à l'analogie de la langue, et à
la vérité de l'hiſtoire. Les meilleurs grammairiens reconnoiſſent
aujourdhui, que les Latins, faute d'une forme moyenne à leurs

à notre correction. Druſus (ſuivant Tacite) arrive au camp des

                  <p>THE multitude of your employments affords at once the proof of your
own merit, of the juſtice done to it by the public, of my preſumption, and
of your goodneſs. How enviable is the lot of that ſmall number of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
minds whoſe talents are equally adapted to promote the purpoſes either
of pleaſure or utility? The diſcernment ſurely of thoſe princes is worthy
of much applauſe, who, having ventured to diſſipate the clouds of envy, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and frivolity, that uſually ſurround thrones, render to the truly great
men among their ſubjects a juſtice which had been long done to them by
the impartial public, and reward their talents, by affording them new oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to diſplay them. Theſe are but a ſmall part of the reflections occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by your letter, and which, were I to conſult my inclination only,
would extend to a great length; but my reaſon tells me, that I muſt be
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0112200701:397"/>
contented with aſſuring you, that you have filled with gratitude a man who
will always be proud of being called your ſcholar. I go ſhortly to England;
where, perhaps, I may find an opportunity of proving to you the ſincerity
of my ſentiments, at leaſt of rendering my correſpondence leſs tireſome.
My reſidence in London will give me a ſort of local merit. I will ſend you
early intelligence of the labours and diſcoveries of our learned men, whoſe
example I am unable to imitate; and will expect to learn, in return, what
is ſo proper an object of curioſity, the occupations and ſtudies of your col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues
and diſciples at Gottingen. At my return to London I propoſe to
myſelf a new pleaſure in collecting all your works, which I will make it my
firſt buſineſs to procure; and for aſſiſting me in this matter, muſt requeſt that
you would give me the titles of all the curious pieces with which you have
enriched the republic of letters. My ignorance of many of them cauſes
both joy and ſhame. It can only be excuſed in conſideration of my youth,
and the place from which this letter is dated.</p>

                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0112200701:398"/>
If I venture to propoſe ſome new doubts, it is becauſe you know better
than any one, that abſolute ſubmiſſion is due only to reaſon, either real or
apparent. You will believe that my only motive for diſcuſſing your leſſons
is to render myſelf worthy of them:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amorem<note n="*" place="bottom">Lucret. de Rer. Natur. L. iii. ver. 5. <hi>et ſeq.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>After this apology, I muſt confeſs that I have ſtill ſome remaining doubts
concerning the Piſo to whom Horace addreſſes his Art of Poetry. You
think that the manner in which that poet ſpeaks of Virgil does not prove the
latter to be ſtill alive; becauſe Horace does not oppoſe the dead to the living,
but the ancients to the moderns. I examined the paſſage again, and that
new peruſal excited reflections which confirmed me more ſtrongly in my
former opinion. Horace thought the Latin tongue too poor and barren, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0112200701:399"/>
deficient in words expreſſive of abſtract ideas, which were unknown to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus'
companions, conſiſting of ſhepherds and robbers. This imperfection
had been remarked by others. Horace, wiſhing to remedy it, propoſes
to the Virgils and Variuſes, to co-operate with him in this deſign, by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
from the Greek many energetic terms and phraſes which were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Latin. He does not juſtify a thing already done, but propoſes a new
enterpriſe. The futurity which he looks to can only have a reference to
authors ſtill alive. The Art of Poetry was therefore written before the year
of Rome ſeven hundred and thirty-five. This explanation agrees ſo well
with the poet's thought, that his oppoſition between the dead and living
poets, concludes with one of the juſteſt and livelieſt images that I ever
remember to have met with:</p>

                  <p>You ſay that Piſo's eldeſt ſon might be ten years old when the Art of
Poetry was publiſhed; an age at which Grotius wrote verſes. Grotius did
ſo; but how few boys of that age have not only the fire to write, but the
judgment to criticiſe poetry? It is not likely that Piſo the father ſhould
have children at the age of twenty. You well know the paucity of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
under Auguſtus, which rendered the conjugal felicity of Germanicus
an example ſo much admired<note n="‡" place="bottom">Suet. L. ii. c. 34.</note>; pride, poverty<note n="§" place="bottom">Tacit. Annal. ii. c. 37.</note>, and debauchery, deterred
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0112200701:401"/>
the Roman nobles from marriage, eſpecially amidſt the civil wars, which,
during Piſo's youth, deſolated the earth. Auguſtus' laws on that ſubject
only prove the greatneſs of the evil<note n="*" place="bottom">Dion. Hiſt. Rom. L. lvi. p. 570.</note>; and Piſo was thirty years old, before
the firſt of thoſe laws was enacted<note n="†" place="bottom">Horat. Carm. Secular. v. 17, &amp;c. Torrent de Lege Juliâ ad Calc. Horat. p. 75, &amp;c.</note>. If an ordinary generation is computed
at thirty-three years<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herodot. L. ii. Newton Chronol. Emendat. p. 41.</note>, the generations under the firſt emperors ought rather
to be extended to forty, than reduced to twenty years. Theſe, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
are but probabilities; but in the ſcience of criticiſm probabilities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
poſſibilities, and are themſelves deſtroyed by proofs. This principle
is not to be controverted. The authority of Porphyrio is of too little weight
among the learned to be the foundation of an argument; it might at beſt
help to prop an argument, otherwiſe well ſupported. The ancients do not
aſſign to him the firſt rank among Horace's commentators<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. Vitam Horat. ſine nomine Autoris.</note>; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0112200701:402"/>
particularly Mr. Dacier, find in him many errors. I do not ſee any
ground for your firſt hypotheſis. If Piſo had a ſon when he was thirty years
old, this ſon might be ſixteen when Horace wrote his Art of Poetry; an age
which you think agrees with every quality required in him. Did you not
forget, in writing this ſentence, that Horace died in ſeven hundred and forty-five,
when Piſo himſelf was only forty years old?</p>
                  <p>2. I think it certain that Horace, in the third ode of his third book,
meant to ſhow the Romans, that if their prince aſpired to divine honours,
<hi>Viamque affectat Olympo,</hi> he well merited them by his exploits, which rivalled
thoſe of the greateſt heroes, Bacchus, Hercules, and Romulus, who, after
trampling on their human enemies, and appeaſing the jealouſy of the gods,
had opened for themſelves a road to the palace of the immortals. But did
the poet alſo intend, by this ode, to reſiſt and deſtroy the clamours of the
people concerning the infamous ſupper of the twelve gods? I think he did
not. 1. This deſign does not agree with chronology. Suetonius does not
tell us the date of this ſupper; but ſince Mark Antony mentioned it, in his
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0112200701:403"/>
letters to Auguſtus<note n="*" place="bottom">Suet. L. ii. c. 70.</note>, it muſt have happened before the laſt quarrel of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs.
According to Bentley<note n="†" place="bottom">Bentley in Praefat. ad Horat.</note>, whoſe opinion you adopt, Horace wrote
the third book of his odes in the forty-ſecond and forty-third years of his
age; that is, in the ſeven hundred and twenty-eighth and ſeven hundred and
twenty-ninth years of Rome. An apology for Auguſtus' debaucheries,
written ſeven years after they happened, could have only ſerved to revive the
memory of enormities, which the policy of that prince and the gratitude of
the Romans had long conſigned to oblivion. 2. Auguſtus ſupped with
eleven men and women, who, as well as himſelf, were adorned with the
emblems of divinities. The poet ſeated Auguſtus at the table of the gods,
<hi>purpureo bibit ore nectar;</hi> but can we reaſonably ſuppoſe that he meant to
place there the companions of his feaſt? This would have been no render
the honour too common; and his panegyric would have degenerated into a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
I agree with you, that it is rather deſirable than neceſſary to diſcover the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0112200701:404"/>
plan of an ode; the writers of Lyric poetry having always enjoyed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of ſoaring to heights, which, if admired by fancy, muſt not be
criticiſed by reaſon. This fault, if it be one, is compenſated by great
beauties. The two firſt ſtanzas prove the wonderful efficacy of poetry
when combined with philoſophy. The <hi>juſtum &amp; tenacem propoſiti virum</hi> is the
ſage of the Stoics, their king<note n="*" place="bottom">Horat. Serm. L. i. Serm. iii. ver. 124.</note>, and only happy man; all whoſe deſigns are
juſt, and inflexibly purſued<note n="†" place="bottom">Cicero pro Murenae, c. 29. De la Mothe le Vayer, tom. i. p. 606, &amp;c. de la Vertu des Payens.</note>. Such a being, exempt from paſſions and
prejudices, never caſts his eyes on the tumults of human life, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming,
<q>
                        <l>"O! curas hominum! O! quantum in rebus inane!"</l>
                     </q>
To the diſgrace of mankind, ſuch a character never exiſted; but it is not
a ſmall honour for the ſpecies, that ſuch perfect virtue has been deſcribed and
reliſhed. The climax is beautiful. The ſage would reſiſt the clamorous
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0112200701:405"/>
fury of a mad multitude; but this popular rage is often appeaſed as eaſily as
it is kindled. He would deſpiſe the threats of a furious tyrant: but the
hearts of tyrant ſometimes relent with compaſſion. He would hear without
terror the raging tempeſt, which overpowers the cries of the wretched; but
fortune has often reſcued victims from the boiſterous waves. He would not
dread the thunder of Jupiter: here the trembling imagination pauſes, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left the poet ſhould either ſink into meanneſs, or ſwell into bombaſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeems impoſſible to conceive a bolder image than the enraged maſter
of gods and men. But our fear is converted into admiration, when we
read <q>he would ſuſtain unterrified the craſhing ſhock of the univerſe,
by which the elements, men, and gods are involved in one common
ruin<note n="*" place="bottom">Plin. L. vi. Epiſt. 20.</note>.</q> I ſtop here, leſt my reflections ſhould tire you; which, if they
do, it muſt be my fault. I ſhall have attained, however, my purpoſe,
which was to ſhow the point of view under which I conſider the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

contempt.</p>
                  <p>3. You remember, Sir, that famous paſſage of Velleius Paterculus<note n="*" place="bottom">Vell. Patere. L. ii. c. 125.</note> which
has given ſo much trouble to the learned. It is as follows: * * * *
It ſeems unſuſceptible of any meaning, and muſt be ſuppoſed either defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or corrupt. All the critics, therefore, who have examined it, endeavour
to reſtore the text. Burerius, Acidalius, Gruter, Boeclerus, Heinſius, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
have, all of them, given conjectures more or leſs probable, which
I ſhall not here diſcuſs. I ſhall rather ſubmit an emendation of my own to
your judgment. Inſtead of the common reading, I would ſubſtitute <hi>Priſâ

ſee at once that this ſmall alteration produces a clear and diſtinct ſenſe; and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0112200701:407"/>
the correction may be proved to be equally conformable to the analogy of
the Latin tongue, and agreeable to the truth of hiſtory. The beſt gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
acknowledge that the Latin, not having a middle voice, admits of a
paſſive participle in an active ſignification<note n="*" place="bottom">V. Burman ad Vell. Paterc. L. ii. c. 97. Perizon. ad Sanct. Minerv. L. i. c. 15. n. 4.</note>. Thus, <hi>juratus, punitus,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

meaning by Velleius himſelf<note n="†" place="bottom">Vell. Paterc. L. ii. c. 97.</note>. <hi>Fuſus</hi> may therefore, without impropriety,
denote the action of Druſus. Hiſtory alſo favours this correction. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Tacitus, when Druſus arrived in the camp of the rebels, his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were diſobeyed, his offers ſuſpected, the ſoldiers made him priſoner,
they inſulted his friends, and waited only for a pretence to begin the ſlaughter.
Such were the dangers that threatened his perſon! <hi>Sibi ancipitia tam re.</hi> The
ſeverity of the Roman diſcipline is well known. The generals were the gods
of the ſoldiers, and their orders received as oracles. But ancient maxims
were now overturned; and the ſedition of the Pannonian legions created an

example moſt pernicious to poſterity. Superſtition, which does ſo much
evil, here did good: an eclipſe of the moon frightened the ſoldiers, and
ſaved the life of the general.</p>
                  <p>I read with much pleaſure your ſolution of the difficulty in Juſtin; and
admire your ſkill in extracting a regular narrative, by bringing the ſcattered

                  <p>Your ſuffrage removes all fear about the ſolidity of my conjecture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                  <p>This Letter, in the early hand-writing of Mr. GIBBON, (probably about
the time of his firſt leaving Lauſanne,) ſeems to be under the aſſumed
character of a Swediſh traveller, writing to a Swiſs friend, delineating
the defects he diſcovered in the government of Berne. In pointing
out thoſe defects he ſeems to have had the intention of ſuggeſting
remedies; but, as he is entering on this topic, the manuſcript ends
abruptly. The excellence of this curious paper will apologize for
its great length.</p>

                        <p>NON, mon cher ami, je ne veux point etre coſmopolite. Loin de
moi ce titre faſtueux, ſous lequel nos philoſophes cachent une
égale indifférence pour tout le genre humain. Je veux aimer ma
patrie, et pour aimer, il me faut des preférences: mais ou je me
trompe, ou mon coeur eſt ſuſceptible de plus d'une. Quand j'aurois
tout ſacrifié pour la Suede, mon pays natal, je ne me ſerois point
encore acquitté envers elle; je lui dois la vie et la fortune: mais
que cette vie ſeroit triſte, que cette fortune me ſeroit à charge,
ſi, expatrié des ma tendre jeuneſſe, votre pays n'eut pas formé mon
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0112200701:410"/>
gout et ma raiſon à des moeurs moins groſſières que les notres! Je
me montrerois indigne de ces bienfaits, s'il ne m'avoient pas inſpiré la
plus vive reconnoiſſance. Aujourd'hui que la Suede, tranquille à l'abri
des loix, n'exige de ſes enfans que de ſentir leur bonheur, je puis,
ſans l'offenſer, jetter un regard ſur le pays de Vaud, mon autre
patrie, me rejouir avec vous de ſes avantages, et compatir à ſes
maux.</p>
                        <p>Votre climat eſt beau, votre terroir fertile; vous avez pour le
commerce intérieur des facilités, dont il ne tient qu'à vous de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiter.
Mais je conſidere plutôt les habitans, que l'habitation. On
va chercher les philoſophes à Londres. Paris attire dans ſon ſein
tous ceux qui n'aiment que la douceur de la ſociété. Votre pays le
cede à ces deux capitales, la ou elles brillent; mais cependant il
réunit tous leurs avantages reſpectifs; il eſt le ſeul où tout à la fois
on oſe penſer, et on ſache vivre. Que vous manque t'il? la liberté:
et privés d'elle, tout vous manque.</p>
                        <p>

Cette vérité vous ſurprend, elle vous bleſſe. Pouvoir dire que
nous ne ſommes pas libres, me repondez vous, prouve que nous le
ſommes. Il le prouveroit peut être, ſi j'écrivois à Lauſanne, ou plutôt
là même il ne prouveroit rien. Vos maîtres connoiſſent la maxime
du Cardinal Mazarin, de vous laiſſer parler, pourvu que vous les
laiſſiez agir. Ainſi le procès n'eſt point encore jugé.</p>
                        <p>Si j'écrivois pour le peuple je m'addreſſerois à ſes paſſions; je le
ferois ſouvenir de cette maxime de tous les tems, que dans les repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
ceux qui ſont libres, ſont plus libres, et ceux qui ſont
eſclaves, plus eſclaves que partout ailleurs. Mais avec un ami tel
que vous, je ne dois chercher que la vérité, et n'employer que la
raiſon. Quand je compare votre état avec celui de vos voiſins, c'eſt
avec plaiſir que je le prononce heureux. Traverſez votre lac et vos
montagnes, vous trouverez partout un peuple digne d'un meilleur
ſort; ſa raiſon abrutie par la ſuperſtition, le patrimoine de ſes
peres, et le fruit de ſon induſtrie, en proye au partiſan, ou au

huſſard. Sa vie ſacrifiée à tout moment au caprice d'un ſeul
homme, qui, lorſqu'il entend parler de vingt milles de ſes ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blables,
morts dans le ſervice de ſon ambition, dira froidement, qu'ils
ont fait leur devoir.</p>
                        <p>Vous au contraire profeſſez un Chriſtianiſme, ramené à la divine
pureté de ſon inſtitution, enſeigné par de dignes paſteurs, à qui on
permet de ſe faire aimer, de ſe faire reſpecter, mais non de ſe faire
craindre. Votre union avec le Corps Helvetique vous a aſſuré
depuis deux ſiecles une paix unique dans l'hiſtoire. Vos impots
ſont petits, l'adminiſtration douce. On n'entend point parler parmi
vous de ces ſentences ſans procès, ſans crime, ſans accuſateur, qui
arrachent un citoyen du milieu de ſa famille. L'on ne voit jamais
le ſouverain, on le ſent rarement. Cependant ſi la liberté conſiſte
à n'être ſoumis qu'à de loix, dont l'objet eſt le bien commun de la
ſociété, vous n'etes point libre.</p>

Quand la violence des uns, et la foibleſſe des autres, ont rendu
néceſſaires les ſociétés civiles, il a fallu renoncer à cette indépendance
ſi chere, et ſi pernicieuſe. Il a fallu que toutes les volontés particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lières
ſe fondiſſent dans une volonté générale; à laquelle des punitions
réglées obligeaſſent chaque citoyen de conformer ſes actions. Qu'il
eſt délicat, ce pouvoir de fixer la volonté générale! En quelles mains
doit on le remettre? Sera-ce à un monarque dès-lors abſolu. Je
ſais que l'intérêt bien entendu du prince ne ſe peut séparer d'avec
celui de ſon peuple, et qu'en travaillant pour lui, il travaille pour
ſoi même. Tel eſt le langage de la philoſophie. Mais ce langage
n'eſt pas un de ceux que les précepteurs font étudier aux rois; et ſi
un heureux naturel leur en donne quelque idée, leurs paſſions, ou
celles d'un miniſtre, d'un confeſſeur, d'une maîtreſſe, l' effacent bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot.
Le peuple gémit, mais il faut qu'il ait gémi long tems, avant
que ſon maître s'apperçoive qu'il eſt de l'intérêt d'un berger de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
ſon troupeau. Il faut donc que le pouvoir légiſlatif ſoit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagé.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0112200701:414"/>
Un conſeil dont les membres s'éclairent et ſe contiennent les
uns les autres, paroît en être un dépoſitaire bien choiſi. Mais la
liberté attache à ce conſeil une condition fondamentale. Elle veut
que chaque ordre des citoyens, chaque partie de l'état, y ait ſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>préſentans
intéreſſés à s'oppoſer à toute loi qui ſeroit nuiſible à ſes
droits, ou contraire à ſon bonheur, puiſqu'eux mêmes en ſentiroient
les premiers, les mauvais effets. Une telle aſſemblée fera rarement
des fautes groſſières, et ſi elle paye quelquefois le tribut à l'humanité,
elle peut rougir de ſes erreurs, et les réparer auſſi tot. Ce portrait
eſt il le votre? J'entre dans votre pays, je vois deux nations diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguées
par leurs droits, leurs occupations, et leurs moeurs. L'une,
compoſée de trois cens familles, eſt née pour commander; l'autre, de
cent mille, n'eſt formée que pour obéir. Toutes les prétenſions hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliantes
des monarques héréditaires ſe renouvellent à votre égard,
et deviennent encore plus humiliantes de la part de vos égaux. La
comparaiſon de vos deux états, vous eſt trop facile. Rien ne vous
aide à l'éloigner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0112200701:415"/>
Un conſeil de trois cens perſonnes décide de tous vos intérêts en
dernier reſſort, et ſi ſes intérêts et les votres ne ſont pas d'accord, quì
doit l'emporter? Non ſeulement ce ſénat eſt légiſlateur, mais il exé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
ſes propres loix. Cette union de deux puiſſances qu'on ne devoit
jamais réunir, les rend chacune plus formidables. Quand elles ſont
ſéparées, la puiſſance légiſlative redoute les réſolutions violentes; elles
ſeroient inutiles, ſi l'on n'armoit pas les mains de la puiſſance qui les
doit exécuter, et cette puiſſance eſt toujours ſa rivale, et ſon contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poids.
Mais ce n'eſt pas aſſez que cette union aiguiſe le glaive de
de l'autorité publique, elle le remet encore dans un plus petit nombre
de mains: dans le dernier ſiecle le grand conſeil de Berne ſe renouvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loit
lui même; c'étoit déja un pas vers l'oligarchie: pourquoi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clure
des élections le corps de la Bourgeoiſie? Alors même le gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
s'appuyoit ſur un fondement aſſez étroit. Bientot des
inconveniens ſe firent ſentir; la brigue, la vénalité, la débauche, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naloient
l'entrée des citoyens dans le conſeil ſouverain, et les riches
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0112200701:416"/>
ambitieux donnoient tout, pour pouvoir tout invahir. Une députa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
révocable de vingt ſix conſeillers, établie dès l'enfance de la ré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,
pour veiller à l'exécution des loix, devint chargée du ſoin
de remplir les places de ce grand conſeil dont elle-même tiroit ſon
origine. On y ajoutoit ſeize ſénateurs choiſis de la manière la
plus favorable aux factieux. Ils poſſedoient d'abord leur pouvoir
collectivement, mais peu à peu l'intérêt particulier leur ſit entendre
qu'il valoit mieux permettre à chacun de nommer ſon fils, ſon
gendre, et ſon parent. Les familles puiſſantes qui dominoient alors
dans le ſénat, y dominent encore. Les de Wattevilles, et les
Steiguers, y rempliſſent une trentaine de places. Le commerce inté<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſé
de bienfaits, où l'on paſſe dans le petit conſeil par les ſuffrages de
ſes parens, pour faire entrer de nouveaux parens dans le grand conſeil,
à déja reduit le nombre dans familles qui ſiegent dans celui-ci, à en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
quatre vingt. Ces maiſons ſouveraines ont un égal mépris pour
ceux que le droit naturel auroit du rendre leurs concitoyens, et
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0112200701:417"/>
pour ceux qui le ſont par la conſtitution de l'état. Il manque même
aux premiers une reſſource que les monarques les plus abſolus, n'ont
pas oſé ôter à leurs ſujets; je veux parler de ces tribunaux reconnus
du ſouverain, et révérés du peuple, pour etre l'organe de la patrie, et
les dépoſitaires des loix. Toutes les volontés du prince, qui doivent
être obéies, le ſont plus facilement, quand les ſujets voyent combien
elles ſont raiſonnables, puiſqu'elles ont paſſé par l'examen de ces
magiſtrats, qu'on ne peut ni tromper, ni ſéduire, ni intimider.
Auſſi répondent ils à cette conſidération, par une réſiſtance reſpectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euſe,
mais déterminée contre l'oppreſſion, où ils étalent tout ce que
la raiſon, la liberté, et l'éloquence peuvent inſpirer à des citoyens
zelés. C'eſt principalement dans ces tribunaux paiſibles que je trouve
ces qualités. Privés d'armes, ils ne doivent leur pouvoir qu'à leur
probité, et à leur éloquence. Eſt il étonnant que ceux, qui n'ont que
cette inſtrument, s'appliquent le plus à le cultiver? Quelles leçons
pour les rois, que les remontrances du Parlement de Paris? Quels
modeles pour le peuple que la conduite des Mandarins de la Chine?
Frappé par un tribunal de cette eſpece, le monarque ne peut mécon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noître
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0112200701:418"/>
les gémiſſemens de la patrie. Les citoyens y apprennent qu'ils
ont une patrie; ils attachent à l'aimer, à étudier ſes loix, à ſe former
à toutes les vertus publiques. Elles mûriſſent dans le ſilence, l'occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
les développe, ou elles ſe font l'occaſion. Les états du Pays de
Vaud, reſpectables ſous les Rois de Bourgogne, et ſous les Ducs de
Savoye, étoient ce tribunal. Compoſés de la nobleſſe, du clergé, et
des députés des villes principales, ils s'aſſembloient tous les ans à
Moudon. C'étoit le conſeil perpétuel du prince. Sans leur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentement,
il ne pouvoit, ni faire de nouvelles loix, ni établir de nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veaux
impots. Si j'étois ſur les lieux j'établirais ces droits, par vos
monumens les plus authentiques. Tout éloigné que j'en ſuis, je ne
erains pas d'appeller à leur témoignage. Il me reſte toujours une
preuve moins ſenſible pour le peuple, mais auſſi déciſive pour les gens
de lettres: c'eſt l'analogie. Les Barbares du cinquième ſiecle jette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
par toute l'Europe, les racines de ce gouvernement que Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne
établit dans les Pays Bas, la France, l'Italie, la Suiſſe, et
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0112200701:419"/>
l'Allemagne. Quelques évenemens, les degrés, et les tems ou les
arrière-fiefs ſe formerent des fiefs, ou le' clergé acquit des terres ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneuriales,
ou les villes acheterent leurs affranchiſſemens, y appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terent
de légères différences. Mais le fond de cette conſtitution eſt
demeuré dans toutes les révolutions, et rien de plus libre que ce
fonds. Ces états, leurs membres, et leurs droits ſe conſerverent
toujours, et partout ils étoient les mêmes.</p>
                        <p>Je vous entends, mon ami, qui m'interrompez. Je vous ai écouté,
me dites vous, avec patience: mais que voulez vous conclure de ce
tableau de notre gouvernement? Bien ou mal conſtruit, nous n'en
reſſentons que des effets ſalutaires, et vos conſeils, vos états, auroient
de la peine à nous dégouter de nos magiſtrats anciens, pour nous faire
eſſayer des nouveautés.</p>
                        <p>Arretez, Monſieur; je vous ai parlé en homme libre, et vous me

pour un moment de votre bonheur, de qui le tenez vous? de la con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution?

Vous n'oſez pas le dire. C'eſt done du prince? Les
Romains en devoient un plus grand à Titus. Ils étoient cependant
de vils eſclaves. Brutus vous auroit appris que, dans un état deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
le prince peut quelquefois vouloir de bien: mais que dans les
états libres, il ne peut que le vouloir. La félicité actuelle du citoyen
et de l'eſclave, eſt ſouvent égale, mais celle du dernier eſt précaire,
puiſqu'elle eſt fondée ſur les paſſions des hommes, pendant que celle
du premier eſt aſſurée. Elle eſt liée avec les loix qui contiennent
également ces mêmes paſſions dans le ſouverain et dans le payſan.</p>
                        <p>Mais malheureuſement on ne trouve que trop de choſes à re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prendre
dans votre adminiſtration politique. Je vais détailler des
ſautes, des negligences, des oppreſſions. Vous vous récrierez ſur
ma malignité, mais en ſecret votre eſprit groſſira le catalogue de
cent articles que j'aurai ou ignorés ou oubliés. Il eſt du devoir du
ſouverain de faire jouir ſon peuple de tous les avantages de la ſociété
civile. Des guerres entrepriſes pour ſa défenſe, l'en détourneront
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0112200701:421"/>
quelquefois; mais dèſque le calme renait dans ſes états, des établiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
utiles, et de ſages loix, la religion, les moeurs, les ſciences, le
commerce, les manufactures, l'agriculture, et la police, méritent toute
ſon attention, et l'en récompenſeront avec uſure. Sur ces principes
jugeons le ſénat de Berne. Il a été maître du Pays de Vaud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puis
l'an 1536. Quand je conſidere ce qu'étoient alors la France,
l'Angleterre, la Hollande, ou l'Allemagne, j'ai de la peine à me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuader
qu'elles étoient les mêmes pays que ceux qui portent aujourd'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hui
ces noms. De barbares, ils ſont devenus civiliſés; d'ignorans,
éclairés; et de pauvres, riches. Je vois des villes où il y avoit des
déſerts, et les forêts défrichées ſe ſont converties en champs fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
Leurs princes, et leurs miniſtres, un Henri quatre, un Sully,
un Colbert, une Elizabeth, un de Wit, un Frederic-Guillaume, ont
opéré ces merveilles. La perſpective du Pays de Vaud n'eſt point
auſſi riante. Les arts languiſſent, faute de ces récompenſes que le
prince ſeul peut donner; nul commerce, nulles manufactures, nuls
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0112200701:422"/>
projets utiles pour le pays; un engourdiſſement général qui regne
partout. Cependant les princes dont je viens de parler n'avoient
que des momens pour ces objets, où les Bernois ont eu des ſiecles.
Que n'auroient ils pas fait, ces grands hommes, rarement tranquilles
ſur le trône, ſi pendant deux cens douze ans, ils n'euſſent eu que
des voiſins pacifiques, et des peuples ſoumis? Je m'en rapporte à
vous même. Indiquez moi quelque établiſſement vraiment utile que
vous deviez au ſouverain. Mais ne m'indiquez pas l'académie de
Lauſanne, fondée par des vues de dévotion, dans la chaleur d'une
réformation, negligée depuis, et toujours académie, quoique un digne
magiſtrat de cette ville, propoſàt de l'ériger en univerſité.</p>
                        <p>Non ce n'eſt point une politique peu eclairée qui fait agir vos
maîtres. Je connois trop leur habileté. Mais un monarque aime
également tous ſes ſujets. Les citoyens d'une ville capitale voyent
au contraire d'un oeil jaloux l'agrandiſſement des provinces. Si elles
s'élevent, diſent ils, nous tombons. Nos égales pour les lumières et
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0112200701:423"/>
les richeſſes, elles voudroient bientôt l'être en pouvoir. Rappellez
vous l'an 1685. La mauvaiſe politique de Louis XIV. expatria la
partie la plus induſtrieuſe de ſes ſujets; une multitude ſe réfugia
dans le Pays de Vaud. Il etoit prochain, il etoit François. Ils ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demandoient
qu'un azile, et l'auroient payé au poids de l'or par les
richeſſes, et les arts plus précieux que les richeſſes, qu'ils vous appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toient.
Mais ici la politique partiale des Bernois s'épouvanta. <q>Si
nous faiſons participer ces fugitifs à notre droit de Bourgeoiſie,
la fortune nous ſera commune; mais comment élever des mortels
au rang des dieux? Si nous les laiſſons confondus parmi nos

Ces exilés las d'eſſuyer des refus, où ils devoient s'attendre à des
prières, paſſerent en Hollande, en Pruſſe, et en Angleterre, où les
ſouverains ſavoient mieux profiter de cette occaſion unique. Il en
reſta une partie dans le Pays de Vaud, mais c'étoit la partie la plus
pauvre, et la plus fainéante, qui n'avoit ni le moyen, ni la vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonté
d'aller plus loin.</p>
                        <p>`A peine ces malheureux commençoient ils à oublier leurs ſouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frances
paſſées, que l'expérience leur ſit ſentir, que pour fuir les
perſécutions, il faut fuir les hommes. La partie ſouveraine de l'état
avoit ſuccé avec le lait, toute la dureté du ſyſtême de Calvin, théo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logien
atrabilaire qui aimoit trop la liberté, pour ſouffrir que les Chré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens
portaſſent d'autres fers que les ſiens. D'ailleurs ſa conformité
avec les idées d'un célebre philoſophe, intéreſſoit l'honneur du nom
Allemand à le ſoutenir. Comme les ſentimens s'étoient adoucis dans
le Pays de Vaud, en proportion avec les moeurs, il falloit y envoyer
des formulaires, et des inquiſiteurs, deſtinés à faire autant d'hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0112200701:425"/>
qu'ils pourroient, non à la vérité par le fer et le feu, mais par
les menaces et les privations d'emploi.</p>
                        <p>En ſoutenant les droits de l'humanité, je n'outre point les maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
de la tolérance. Je veux bien que le magiſtrat ne diſtribue
les récompenſes du public, qu'à ceux qui enſeignent la religion du
public. Je ne lui défens pas même de contenir dans le ſilence ces
novateurs trop hardis qui voudroient éclairer le peuple ſur cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
objets où l'erreur fait ſon bonheur. Mais que le ſouverain ſe
prêtant avec chaleur aux minuties théologiques, décide des queſtions
qu'on ne peut décider, aſſurement il eſt abſurde. Qu'impoſant des
confeſſions de foi, il ne laiſſe à des paſteurs vieillis, dans le miniſtere, et
qui ne demandoient qu'à ſe taire, que le choix du menſonge ou de
la mendicité, aſſurement il eſt injuſte. Mais la perſécution ceſſa.—
Qui la fit ceſſer? Un ſentiment de honte? les larmes des ſujets? ou
bien la crainte qu'inſpira l'entrepriſe d'un Davel, enthouſiaſte il eſt
vrai, mais enthouſiaſte pour le bien public? Encore même il regne à
Lauſanne une inquiſition ſourde. Les noms d'Arminien, et de Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nien
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0112200701:426"/>
rempliſſent encore ces lettres ou de tres honnêtes gens rendent

ſuivant ces indices que les places ſe diſtribuent.</p>
                        <p>Je viens, non pas d'épuiſer, mais d'indiquer quelques défauts qui
ſe trouvent dans votre puiſſance légiſlative. Paſſons à l'exécutrice.
Celle-ci eſt la force publique, comme l'autre eſt la volonté publique.
Mais un ſeul corps, un ſeul homme, peut délibérer et décider pour
toute une nation. Il ne peut tout ſeul agir pour elle. L'adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
politique, compoſée d'un nombre infini de branches, veut qu'un
grand nombre d'officiers, ſoumis les uns aux autres, s'employent à
faire jouer la machine à laquelle le maître ne peut que donner le
mouvement général. Les honneurs, et les avantages, que les loix
attachent à ces emplois, doivent être ouverts à tous les citoyens, que
leurs talens et leur éducation ont mis en état de les remplir. Les
fardeaux leur ſont communs à tous, les recompenſes doivent l'etre
auſſi. Un gouvernement monarchique ſatisfait aiſement à ces juſtes
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0112200701:427"/>
prétenſions. `Al'exception de quelques courtiſans, qui approchent la
perſonne du prince d'aſſez près, pour ſubſtituer la flatterie aux ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
tous ſes ſujets lui ſont égaux. Dèſqu'un homme a du mérite,
ou, ſi l'on veut de la faveur, on ne lui demande point s'il eſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ou Provençal. D'Epernon étoit Gaſcon; Richelieu, Champe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois;
Mazarin, Romain. Mais dans les républiques ariſtocratiques,
les ſouverains compoſés de toute une ville veulent être légiſlateurs en
corps, et partager entre eux en détail tous les emplois conſidérables.
Les talens, les lumières, dans votre Pays, ſont inutiles pour quicon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
n'eſt pas né Bernois, et dans un autre ſens ils ſont également
inutiles pour qui l'eſt. Le ſujet ſe voit condamné par ſa naiſſance à
ramper dans un honteuſe obſcurité. Le déſeſpoir le ſaiſit; il neglige
ce qui ne le peut mener à rien, et le grand homme ne devient qu'un
homme agréable. Si je parlais de faire participer les ſujets aux
Bailliages, les Bernois crieroient au ſacrilege; les Bailliages ſont le
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0112200701:428"/>
patrimoine de l'état, et nous ſommes l'état. Il eſt vrai qu'on vous
laiſſe les Lieutenances Baillivales; mais vous ſavez aſſez qu'on y mêle
certaines ſtipulations, de façon que, ſi le nouveau magiſtrat ne vit
pas quelque tems, ſa famille perd au marché.</p>
                        <p>Privés de reſſources, que reſte il aux gentilhommes du Pays de
Vaud? le ſervice étranger. Mais on n'a pas manqué de leur
rendre cette carrière des plus épineuſes, et de leur y fermer l'accès des
grades un peu élevés. Je ne dirai rien du brilliant ſervice de France.
Les dépenſes ſont inévitables, et la paye ſi modique que l'enſeigne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruine,
le capitaine vit à peine, et même le colonel ne peut amaſſer.
Ainſi vous devez bénir le ſoin paternel du ſouverain qui a dreſſé
toutes les capitulations, de manière à ne vous point introduire en ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Ne parlons que du ſervice des Etats Généraux, ſervice plus
utile que riant, ou l'on s'ennuye et s'enrichit. Par le traité de 1712,
le Canton de Berne accorda vingt quatre compagnies à leurs Hautes
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0112200701:429"/>
Puiſſances, et promit de permettre qu'on en ſit toujours des recrues
dans leurs états. Seize compagnies étoient deſtinées aux Bernois, et
les ſouverains partageoient avec leurs ſujets les huit autres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnies,
dont on daignoit laiſſer l'entrée ouverte à ceux ci: ainſi
à ne ſuppoſer le crédit des Bernois qu'égal à celui des ſujets, pour
parvenir à ces huit dernières compagnies, ce peuple roi en poſſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roit
toujours vingt, ſur vingt quatre. La proportion eſt honnête, ſi
l'on fait attention qu'il y a dans le Canton près de cent mille
hommes en état de porter les armes, dont il n'y en a pas huit cens,
bourgeois de Berne. D'ailleurs les petits bourgeois, à qui ce nom
ſeul inſpire de la fierté, aiment mieux croupir dans la miſère à
Berne, que de ſe faire par leur travail un état vraiment reſpectable.
Ainſi dans toutes ces troupes, je doute qu'on puiſſe trouver cinquante
Bernois qui ne ſoient par officiers.</p>
                        <p>Ces malheurs, me dites vous, ne ſont que pour les gentilhommes;
c'eſt à dire, pour la partie la plus reſpectable, mais la moins nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breuſe,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0112200701:430"/>
des citoyens. Ils s'évanouiſſent dans ces maximes générales
et égales que vous venez d'établir. La tyrannie de vos Baillis s'y
évanouit elle auſſi? Le peuple, nom ſi cher à l'humanité, en ſent
tout le joug. Je ne vous conterai point des hiſtoires de leurs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
Vous me chicaneriez ſur la vérité des faits, et puis vous
me diriez, qu'il ne faut jamais conclure du particulier au général,
et vous auriez raiſon. Il vaut mieux faire ſentir l'étendue de leur
pouvoir, et laiſſer à votre connoiſſance du coeur humain, à juger de
l'uſage qu'ils en font. Chaque Bailli eſt à la fois chef de la juſtice,
de la milice, des finances, et de la réligion. Comme juge, il décide
ſans appel juſqu'à la ſomme de cent francs, ſomme tres modique
pour vous, mais qui fait la fortune d'un payſan; et il décide ſeul,
car ſes aſſeſſeurs, n'ont pas voix pondérative. Il donne, ou plutôt
il vend, preſque tous les emplois dans ſon bailliage. Si l'on veut
appeller de ſes ſentences, il n'y a plus de tribunal à Moudon; il faut
aller à Berne, et quel payſan veut ſe ruiner à la pourſuite de la
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0112200701:431"/>
juſtice? S'il cherche encore à faire punir ſon tyran, il demande
l'entrée en conſeil. L'Avoyer l'accorde, peut être avec beaucoup
de difficulté, et à force de fatigues et de dépenſes il parvient à pouvoir
plaider devant un tribunal lié avec ſon baillif par le ſang, et plus
encore par une conformité de forfaits, ou d'intérêts.</p>
                        <p>Votre pays eſt épuiſé par les impots, tout modiques qu'ils ſont.
Dévelopons cette idée. Pendant que les pays le plus riches de
l'Europe s'abyment de dépenſes et de dettes, et mettent en oeuvre des
moyens qui feroient trembler le plus hardi diſſipateur, le Canton de
Berne eſt le ſeul qui amaſſe des tréſors. Le ſecret de l'état eſt ſi bien
gardé, qu'il eſt difficile de le deviner. Stanian, ambaſſadeur d'Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre
à Berne, qui avoit un eſprit d'obſervation et de grandes facilités
pour ſe bien informer, eſtimoit, il y a quarante ans, les ſommes qu'il
avoit dans les fonds publics de Londres à trois cens milles livres ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
ou ſept millions, et tout ce qui étoit reſté dans le tréſor de
Berne, ou diſpersé dans les autres banques de l' Europe, à dix huit
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0112200701:432"/>
cens mille livres ſterling, ou quarante trois millions. On peut
croire que ces tréſors n'ont pas diminués depuis l'an 1722. Le
moyen que le Canton employe pour s'enrichir eſt très ſimple. Il
dépenſe beaucoup moins qu'il ne reçoit. Mais que reçoit il? Je
l'ignore; mais je vais tacher de le deviner. Les douze bailliages du
Pays de Vaud rendent dans leurs ſix ans, à peu pres cinq cens mille
livres de Suiſſe, les uns portant les autres. Le revenu de douze,
peut donc monter à un million de livres de rente. J'ai toujours
entendu dire que les Baillis prennent le dix pour cent ſur les
revenus du ſouverain. Le voilà donc ce revenu d'un million par
année. En rabattant les cent mille livres des Baillis, je compterais
encore cent mille écûs pour les charges de l'état, ce qui n'eſt point une
ſuppoſition batie en l'air. Les autres deux cens mille ecûs, qui dans
un autre pays, fourniroient à l'entretien d'une cour et d'une armée,
dont les dépenſes feroient retomber ſur la terre la roſée qui en étoit
tirée, vont ici s'enfouir dans les coffres du ſouverain, ou ſe diſperſer
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0112200701:433"/>
dans les banques publiques, et précaires de l'Europe, pour etre un
jour une proye à l'infidélité d'un commis, ou à l'ambition d'un con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querant.
Cette peſte continuelle des eſpeces éteint l'induſtrie, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pêche
tout effort, qui ne ſe peut faire ſans argent, et appauvrit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſiblement
le pays.</p>
                        <p>Tels ſont vos maux, Monſieur. Eh bien! me repondez vous,
n'avez vous ſondé, nos playes que pour en aigrir la douleur? Quel
conſeil nous donnez vous? Aucun, ſi vous ne m'avez pas déja
prévenu. Il y a une voye que je puis vous conſeiller, c'eſt celle de
la remontrance. Mais il y a des maux tellement enracinés dans la
conſtitution d'un état, que Platon lui même n'eut pas eſpéré du ſuccès
pour une pareille députation. Ne tiendront ils pas contre les remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances,
eux qui ont pu tenir contre deux cens and de fidélité et de
ſervices? Il y a un autre remede plus prompt, plus entier, plus
glorieux: Guillaume Tell vous l'eût conſeillé; mais je ne vous le con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeille
point. Je ſais que l'eſprit du citoyen, comme celui de la cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rité,
ſouffre beaucoup, et eſpere longtems. Il a raiſon. Il connoit
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0112200701:434"/>
les malheurs attachés à la ſoumiſſion. Il ignore ceux que la réſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
pourroit entrainer. Vous, qui me connoiſſez, Monſieur, vous
ſavez combien je reſpecte ces principes amis de la paix et des
hommes. Tribun ſéditieux, je ne chercherai jamais à faire ſecouer au
peuple le joug de l'autorité, pour le conduire du murmure, à la ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
de la ſedition, à l'anarchie; et de l'anarchie, peut être, au

                        <p>Cependant avec la franchiſe, qui a partout conduit ma plume, je

Que vous préfériez le parti de l'entrepriſe ou celui du répos, je vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drois

                        <p>Les Bernois ont les droits ſur votre obéiſſance; vous craignez de

                  <p>No; my dear friend, I will not be a citizen of the world; I reject with
ſcorn that proud title, under which our philoſophers conceal an equal indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
for the whole human race. I will love my country; and to love it
above all others, there muſt be reaſons for my preference: but, if I am not
miſtaken, my heart is ſuſceptible of affection for more countries than one.
Did I ſacrifice all to Sweden, I ſhould only pay my debt of gratitude to the
land in which I was born, and to which I owe my life and fortune. Yet
life and fortune would have been but melancholy burthens, if, after my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
from home in early youth, your country had not formed my taſte
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0112200701:410"/>
and reaſon, and taught me more refined morals than our own. I ſhould
prove myſelf unworthy of this goodneſs, did it not inſpire me with the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
gratitude: and now that Sweden, enjoying tranquillity under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of laws, requires nothing from its ſubjects but a juſt ſenſe of their
happineſs, I may direct my attention, without offence, to the Pais de Vaud,
my ſecond country; rejoicing with you in its advantages, or commiſerating
its miſfortunes.</p>
                  <p>You enjoy a fine climate, a fertile ſoil, and have conveniencies for internal
commerce, from which great benefit might be derived. But I conſider the
people rather than their territory. Philoſophy flouriſhes in London; Paris
is the centre of thoſe attracted by the allurements of poliſhed ſociety. Your
country, though inferior to thoſe capitals, yet unites in ſome meaſure their
reſpective advantages: ſince it is the only country whoſe inhabitants, while
they think freely and boldly, live politely and elegantly. What then is
wanting? Liberty; and deprived of it, you have loſt your all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:0112200701:411"/>
This truth ſurpriſes and offends you. The right of complaining, you
anſwer, that we are not free, is a proof of our liberty. If I wrote at Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne,
the argument would have weight; yet even there, it would not be
convincing; for your maſters are not ignorant of Cardinal Mazarine's maxim,
and are willing to allow you to talk, provided you allow them to act; ſo that
the proceſs is not yet determined.</p>
                  <p>If I wrote for the people I would ſpeak to their paſſions, and hold a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
repeated in all ages, that under republics, thoſe who are free are more
free, and thoſe who are enſlaved, more enſlaved, than under any other form
of government. But with a friend like you I would ſeek only the maxims
of truth, and employ only the arguments of reaſon. When I compare
your condition with that of ſurrounding nations, I can ſincerely congratulate
you on your happineſs. Whenever we quit the neighbourhood of your lake
and mountains, we find men who, though worthy of a better fate, are
plunged in the moſt abject ſuperſtition; whoſe property and induſtry are the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0112200701:412"/>
ſpoils of a licentious ſoldiery; and whoſe lives are ready every moment to
be ſacrificed to the caprice of one man, who, when he hears that twenty
thouſand of his fellow-creatures have fallen ſacrifices to his ambition, is
contented with ſaying coldly, "they have done their duty."</p>
                  <p>You, on the contrary, enjoy a Chriſtianity brought back to the purity of
its original principles, taught publicly by worthy miniſters, who are loved
and reſpected, but who have it not in their power to become the objects of
fear. Your connection with the Swiſs cantons has preſerved to you the
bleſſings of peace two centuries; a thing unexampled in hiſtory. Your
taxes are moderate; and the public adminiſtration is gentle. You have not
to complain of thoſe arbitrary ſentences, which, without any form of legal
procedure, without an accuſer, and without a crime, have been known to
tear citizens from the boſoms of their families. The ſovereign is never
ſeen; the weight of his authority is rarely felt: yet if liberty conſiſts in
being ſubject to laws, which impartially conſult the intereſts of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the community, you do not enjoy that bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:0112200701:413"/>
When the injuſtice of ſome, and the weakneſs of others, ſhowed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for civil ſociety, individuals were obliged to renounce their beloved,
but pernicious, independence. All particular wills were melted down into
the general will of the public; by which, under the ſanction of definite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
men became bound to regulate their conduct. But it is a matter
of the utmoſt delicacy to determine with whom that general will ought to
be depoſited. Shall it reſide in the breaſt of a prince, who thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
abſolute? I know that the true intereſts of a prince can never be
ſeparated from thoſe of his people, and that in exerting himſelf for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
he labours for his own. This is the language of philoſophy, but it is
ſeldom ſpoken by the preceptors of princes; and if the latter ſometimes
read it in their own hearts, the impreſſion is ſpeedily effaced by contrary
paſſions, in themſelves, their confeſſors, their miniſters, or miſtreſſes. The
groans of the people are not ſoon heard; and their maſter learns only by a

The legiſlative power, therefore, cannot ſafely be entruſted to a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

A council, whoſe members mutually inſtruct, and mutually check
each other, appears to be its proper depoſitory. But in this council one
condition is eſſentially requiſite. It muſt conſiſt of deputies from every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the ſtate, intereſted by their own ſafety in oppoſing every regulation
inconſiſtent with the happineſs of that order to which they belong. Such a
council will rarely be guilty of groſs errors; and ſhould this ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
it will ſoon bluſh for, and repair them. Is this the picture of your
legiſlature? When I ſurvey your country, I behold two nations, diſtinctly
characteriſed by their rights, employments, and manners: the one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of three hundred families, born to command; the other, conſiſting of
an hundred thouſand, doomed to ſubmiſſion. The former are inveſted, as a
body, with all the prerogatives of hereditary monarchs, which are the more
humiliating to you their ſubjects, becauſe they belong to men apparently
your equals. The compariſon between yourſelves and them is made every
moment; no circumſtance tends to conceal it from your fancy.</p>

A council of three hundred perſons is the ſovereign umpire of your deareſt
intereſts, which will always be ſacrificed when they claſh with their own.
This council is inveſted with the executive, as well as the legiſlative, power;
two branches of authority which can never be united, without rendering each of
them too formidable to the ſubject. When they belong to different perſons,
or aſſemblies, the legiſlature will not venture to form violent reſolutions,
becauſe theſe would be of no avail, unleſs they were carried into execution
by another power, always its rival, and often its antagoniſt. The ſword of
authority is not only ſharpened by this union, but is thereby confined to a
ſmaller number of hands. In the laſt century the great council of Bern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to elect its own members; which was a great ſtep towards oligarchy,
ſince it excluded from elections the citizens at large, and thereby narrowed the
baſis of the government. But this arrangement was liable to other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies.
Intrigue, venality, and debauchery ſignaliſed the admiſſion of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
into the ſovereign council; and ambitious men ſquandered their wealth,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0112200701:416"/>
that they might purchaſe a right to indulge their rapacity. A committee of
ſix counſellors, eſtabliſhed in the infancy of the republic, to watch the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the laws, and whoſe offices were held at pleaſure, became entruſted
with the power of naming the members of the grand council, by which this
committee itſelf was appointed. Its number was augmented by ſixteen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
choſen in the manner moſt favourable to the deſigns of faction. They
exerciſed their power at firſt collectively, but by degrees they came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that their particular intereſts would be better promoted by each
naming his ſon, ſon-in-law, or kinſman. The powerful families which then
commanded the ſenate, ſtill rule in it at preſent. Thirty places are filled by
the Wattevilles and Steiguers. This ſelfiſh traffic, by which the members of
the little council are elected by the great council, conſiſting of their own rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they may name other relations to ſeats in the great council, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the number of families, which have a right to ſit in the latter, to nearly
fourſcore. Theſe princely families look down with equal contempt on thoſe
who are their fellow-citizens by the law of nature, and thoſe who were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0112200701:417"/>
ſuch by the conſtitution of their country. The former claſs is deprived
of a reſources which the moſt abſolute princes have ſeldom ventured to wreſt
from their ſubjects; I mean thoſe courts of juſtice acknowledged by the
prince, and revered by the people, as the organs of public opinion, and the
depoſitories of the laws. The commands of the ſovereign are obeyed with
cheerfulneſs only when their propriety is confirmed by the approbation of
thoſe tribunals, whoſe members it has been found difficult either to deceive,
to ſeduce, or to intimidate. Their reſiſtance to oppreſſion is reſpectful, but
firm; and in exerting it, they diſplay that warmth of eloquence with which
reaſon and liberty inſpire good citizens. In the members of thoſe peaceful
tribunals, ſuch qualities appear in their greateſt luſtre. Deſtitute of arms,
their whole ſtrength lies in their talents and their probity. What noble
leſſons to kings have been given by the parliament of Paris? What excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
examples to ſubjects are ſet by the Mandarines of China? Monarchs
<hi>muſt</hi> hear the groans of their people, when ſuch reſpectable bodies of men
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0112200701:418"/>
are their organs. The people too learn that they have a country, which
they will begin to love, to ſtudy its laws, and to form themſelves to public
virtues. Theſe virtues ripen ſilently; they are exerted when an opportunity
offers; and ſometimes they will make an opportunity for their own exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the Païs de Vaud, which was equally reſpectable under the kings
of Burgundy and the dukes of Savoy, the ſtates formed ſuch a tribunal.
They were compoſed of the nobility, clergy, and deputies from the principal
cities, which annually aſſembled at Moudon, and formed the perpetual
council of the prince, without whoſe conſent he could neither enact new
laws, nor impoſe new taxes. Were I on the ſpot, I could prove the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of thoſe rights by your moſt authentic records. At a diſtance I can
only appeal to their teſtimony, and employ an analogical proof, which will
be ſufficiently convincing to men of letters. The Barbarians, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
Europe in the fifth century, every where laid the foundation of that
form of government which Charlemagne eſtabliſhed in the Low Countries,
France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. The different modes of tenure
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0112200701:419"/>
which were at different times introduced, the various degrees of dependance
which one fief came to have on another, the acquiſition of lordſhips by the
clergy, and the purchaſe of franchiſes by cities; all theſe circumſtances occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
but ſlight differences in the ground-work of the conſtitution, which
remained unalterably founded on a firm baſis of liberty. The ſtates, their
members, and their rights, were invariably maintained; remaining uniformly
the ſame at all times, and in all places.</p>
                  <p>I think that I hear you, my friend, interrupting me. Hitherto, you ſay,
I have liſtened to you with patience; but what is your concluſion from this
picture of our government? Whatever defects there may be in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
we have experienced its ſalutary conſequences; and the ſtates and
aſſemblies which you ſo much commend, will not eaſily make us aboliſh our
ancient magiſtracies, in order to try innovations.</p>
                  <p>It is time, Sir, to pauſe; I ſpoke to you as became a freeman, and you
anſwer me in the language of ſlavery. Let us admit for a moment your
proſperity; to whom do you owe it? You will not anſwer, to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0112200701:420"/>
It is due then to your rulers. The Romans owed a proſperity yet
greater to Titus; but ſtill remained the baſeſt of ſlaves. Brutus would have
taught you that a deſpot may ſometimes chooſe to promote the public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
but that the magiſtrates of a free people can have no other wiſh.
The advantages actually enjoyed by a citizen and a ſlave may be the ſame;
but thoſe of the latter are precarious, having no other foundation than the
changeable paſſions of men; whereas thoſe of the former are ſecure, being
ſolidly ſupported on thoſe laws which curb guilty paſſions in the prince as
well as in the peaſant.</p>
                  <p>But unfortunately too many faults may be ſound in your public admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
I ſhall give you the black liſt of omiſſions and oppreſſions, which,
notwithſtanding that you will exclaim againſt my malignity, your own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
will augment by an hundred articles, which I may be either ignorant
of, or forget to mention. It is the duty of a ſovereign to procure for
his people all the happineſs of which their condition is ſuſceptible. His
public ſpirited exertions may be ſuſpended by the exigencies of defenſive
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0112200701:421"/>
war; but as ſoon as peace is reſtored, he will be continually and uſefully
occupied with the intereſts of religion, laws, morals, ſciences, police, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and agriculture. Let us try the merits of the ſenate of Bern by
theſe maxims. The members of this ſenate have been maſters of the Païs
de Vaud ſince the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty-ſix. When we
conſider the deplorable condition in thoſe days of France, England, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and Germany, we can ſcarcely imagine that they were the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
with thoſe reſpectively known at preſent by the ſame names. Their
barbariſm has been civilized, their ignorance enlightened, their poverty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched;
their deſerts have become cities, and their foreſts now wave with
yellow harveſts. Theſe wonders have been effected by their princes and
miniſters: a Henry the Fourth, a Sully, a Colbert, an Elizabeth, a de Witt,
and a Frederick William. The comparative condition of the Païs de Vaud
at thoſe two remote aeras, does not preſent ſo pleaſing a picture. There
the arts ſtill languiſh, for want of thoſe encouragements which princes
only can beſtow: the country is ſtill deſtitute of commerce and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
we hear not of any projects for promoting the public proſperity: we
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0112200701:422"/>
ſee nothing but the marks of an univerſal lethargy. Yet the princes above
mentioned had but moments for executing their great deſigns; the ſenators
of Bern have had ages. What benefits might not thoſe patriotic kings
have conferred on their ſubjects, if, inſtead of having their thrones conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
ſhaken by war and ſedition, they had enjoyed during two centuries
the advantage of having loyal ſubjects and pacific neighbours? I appeal to
yourſelf; point out a ſingle uſeful eſtabliſhment which the Païs de Vaud owes
to the ſovereignty of Bern: but do not tell me of the academy of Lauſanne,
founded on motives of religion during the zeal of reformation, but ſince
totally neglected, though a worthy magiſtrate of that city propoſed the laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
deſign of erecting it into an univerſity.</p>
                  <p>Your maſters err not through ignorance. They are not deficient, I
know, in political abilities. But while a prince treats with impartial bounty
all his ſubjects, the citizens of an ariſtocratical capital are apt to behold with
jealouſy the improvement of the provinces. Their elevation, they think,
muſt pave the way for their own downfal; and if they become their equals
in point of knowledge and riches, they will ſoon be tempted, they imagine,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0112200701:423"/>
to aſpire at an equality with themſelves in power. Recal to memory the
year one thouſand ſix hundred and eighty-five; when the wretched policy of
Louis the Fourteenth drove from their country the moſt induſtrious portion
of his ſubjects, many of whom ſought refuge in the Païs de Vaud; a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
diſtrict, and ſpeaking their own language. They requeſted only
an aſylum, the benefits of which they would richly have repaid by the wealth
which they carried with them, and their ſkill in manufactures, ſtill more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
But the narrow policy of Bern took the alarm. <q>If we make
theſe men citizens of Bern, their intereſts will coincide with our own.
But is it fit that mortals ſhould be raiſed to the rank of gods? If they
are mixed with the maſs of our ſubjects, our ſubjects will be enriched by
their induſtry.</q> They concluded therefore, with the ambaſſadors of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenna—
<q>that it was more deſirable for a prince to govern a poor but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
people, than to contend with the unruly paſſions of men pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
by proſperity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:0112200701:424"/>
The emigrants, diſguſted at being repeatedly refuſed what they ought to
have been requeſted to accept, travelled to Holland, Pruſſia, and England,
whoſe rulers had the good ſenſe to avail themſelves of an emergency as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
as it was ſingular. A part of them indeed remained in the Païs
de Vaud, but the pooreſt and the idleſt, who had neither money nor ſpirit
to travel farther.</p>
                  <p>Theſe unhappy fugitives had no ſooner begun to forget their paſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
than they learned by fatal experience that, in order to avoid perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
it was neceſſary to fly from the ſociety of men. The ſovereigns of
the country in which they had ſettled had imbibed the ſevere ſyſtem of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,
a ſtern theologian, who loved liberty too well, to endure that Chriſtians
ſhould wear any other chains than thoſe impoſed by himſelf. His near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in opinion with a celebrated German philoſopher, intereſted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the German name in ſupporting his doctrines. But in the Païs
de Vaud the aſperity of religious opinions had ſoftened with the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſociety. It became neceſſary, therefore, to ſend thither formulas
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0112200701:425"/>
and inquiſitors, deſigned to make as many hypocrites as poſſible, not indeed
by fire and ſword, but by threats and depoſition from office.</p>
                  <p>In ſupporting the rights of man, I would not carry too far the maxims
of toleration. It is juſt that public rewards ſhould be beſtowed only on thoſe
who teach the religion of the public; and thoſe bold innovators, who would
impart a dangerous light to the people, may very properly be reſtrained by
the arm of the magiſtrate. But it ſurely is abſurd, that the ſovereign ſhould
interfere in theological minutiae, and take part warmly in queſtions which
are incapable of being decided. It is particularly unjuſt, that he ſhould
impoſe confeſſions of ſaith on old miniſters, who wiſh to avoid diſputation;
leaving them the miſerable alternative of falſehood or beggary. But this
perſecution has now ceaſed. What put an end to it? It was not ſhame,
nor the tears of the people, but the boldneſs of Davel, that meritorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt.
Even to the preſent day, a ſecret inquiſition ſtill reigns at Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne;
where the names of Arminian and Socinian are often mentioned in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0112200701:426"/>
the letters written by very honeſt people to their patrons of Bern; and
offices are often given or withheld according to the reports made of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
tenets of the candidates.</p>
                  <p>Having made theſe ſtrictures on your legiſlature, which by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt
the ſubject, I proceed to conſider the defects of your executive power;
which is the public force, as the legiſlature ought to be the public will. But
a ſingle council, or a ſingle man, may deliberate and reſolve for a whole
nation; the executive power, on the contrary, requires the exertions of many:
as it is compoſed of a great variety of branches, many officers, ſubordinate
one to the other, muſt actuate the different parts of the machine, to which
the chief magiſtrate can only communicate the firſt general movement. The
honours and emoluments legally attached to ſuch offices, ought to be open
to all thoſe citizens who are properly qualified for diſcharging them. Each
individual, as he bears a ſhare of the public burdens, is entitled alſo to a
ſhare of the public rewards. This juſt arrangement is eaſily maintained in
monarchies; where, with the exception of a few courtiers, who, by being
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0112200701:427"/>
continually about the prince's perſon, have an opportunity of ſubſtituting
flattery inſtead of real ſervices, all the inhabitants of the kingdom are treated
with comparative equity. In France, provided a man has court-favour
or merit, the queſtion is never aſked whether he comes from Provence or
Normandy. D'Epernon was born in Gaſcony; Richelieu, in Champagne;
Mazarine, in Rome. But in ariſtocratical republics, the citizens of one
town are not contented with being ſovereigns collectively, unleſs they indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually
appropriate all offices of honour or emolument. In the canton of
Bern talents and information are not of the ſmalleſt uſe to any one who is
not born in the capital; and in another ſenſe they are uſeleſs to thoſe born
there; becauſe they <hi>muſt</hi> make their way without them. Their ſubjects in
the Païs de Vaud are condemned, by the circumſtances of their birth, to a
condition of ſhameful obſcurity. They naturally become, therefore, a prey
to deſpair; and neglecting to cultivate talents which they can never enjoy an
opportunity to diſplay, thoſe who had capacities for becoming great men are
contented with making themſelves agreeable companions. Should I propoſe
that the ſubjects obtained a right to hold the lucrative employments of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0112200701:428"/>
                     <hi>Baillis,</hi> or governors of diſtricts, the ariſtocratical families of Bern would
think me guilty of a crime little leſs than ſacrilege. <q>The emoluments of
theſe offices form the patrimony of the ſtate; and we are the ſtate.</q> It
is true, that you in the Païs de Vaud may be deputies to the Baillis; but the
advantages belonging to that ſubordinate magiſtracy are obtained on certain
conditions, which, unleſs the holder of the office lives a certain number of
years, renders his bargain a very bad one for his family.</p>
                  <p>What encouragement is then left for the gentlemen of the Païs de Vaud?
That of foreign ſervice. But to them, even this road to preferment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
difficult, and to attain the higher ranks is impoſſible. I ſpeak not
of the brilliant ſervice of France: in that country, expence is unavoidable;
the enſign is ruined, the captain can ſcarcely live, and the colonel cannot
ſave money. You are therefore obliged to the paternal care of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of Bern, whoſe treaties for ſupplying troops to France do not lead
you into temptation. Let us only conſider the ſervice of Holland, a ſervice
more profitable than ſhowy, where officers have nothing to do but to grow
rich. By the treaty of 1712, the Canton of Bern granted the uſe of twenty-four
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0112200701:429"/>
companies to their High Mightineſſes, and promiſed that they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be allowed to recruit them in their territories. But the command of
ſixteen of thoſe companies was appropriated by the citizens of Bern, and the
remaining eight were left common between them and their ſubjects in the
Païs de Vaud. On the ſuppoſition, then, that the intereſt of both claſſes of
candidates for thoſe companies is equal, the ſovereign people will obtain
four out of the eight, and twenty out of the whole twenty-four. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
appears the more unreaſonable, when it is conſidered that in the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
there are above an hundred thouſand men ſit to bear arms, of whom
ſcarcely eight hundred are citizens of Bern. Beſides, the poorer claſſes of
citizens, proud merely of this title, prefer living in idleneſs at Bern to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
exertions abroad, by which they might better their condition.
I doubt, therefore, whether fifty citizens of Bern, who are not officers, will
be found in the whole of the Swiſs Dutch troops.</p>
                  <p>Theſe inconveniencies, you will tell me, are only felt by men of family;
that is to ſay, by the moſt reſpectable, but leaſt numerous, portion of the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0112200701:430"/>
community; and they diſappear amidſt the general equity and impartiality
of the public adminiſtration. But does the tyranny of the <hi>bailiffs</hi> diſappear
alſo? The people, a name ſo dear to humanity, feel the full weight of
their oppreſſion. I will not have recourſe to particular examples; becauſe
you might call in queſtion the authenticity of facts, or object with reaſon,
that general concluſions are not to be drawn from particular principles. I
ſhall be contented with pointing out the extent of their power, and leave to
your own knowledge of human nature to infer the abuſes with which it muſt
be accompanied. In his own diſtrict every bailiff is at the head of religion,
of the law, the army, and the finances. As judge, he decides, without appeal,
all cauſes to the amount of an hundred franks; a ſum of little importance
to a gentleman, but which often makes the whole fortune of a peaſant; and
he decides alone, for the voice of his aſſeſſors has not any weight in the
ſcale. He confers, or rather he ſells, all the employments in his diſtrict.
When the injured party wiſhes to appeal from his ſentence, as there is no
court of juſtice at Moudon, he is obliged to remove the cauſe to Bern; and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0112200701:431"/>
how few peaſants can bear this expence? But if his eagerneſs to puniſh his
tyrant carries him thither, it is not without many difficulties on his part that
the Avoyer, or chief magiſtrate, grants him admiſſion into the council; where,
after all his trouble and expence, he is finally allowed to plead his cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a tribunal, the members of which are connected with his oppreſſor by
the ties of blood, and ſtill more by a conformity of intereſts and crimes.</p>
                  <p>Your taxes, moderate as they are, exhauſt the country. This obſervation
requires to be explained. While the great kingdoms of Europe, loaded
with expences and debts, are driven to expedients which would alarm the
wildeſt prodigal, Bern is the only ſtate which has amaſſed a large treaſure.
The ſecret has been ſo well kept, that it is not eaſy to aſcertain its amount.
Stanyan, the Britiſh envoy at Bern, a man inquiſitive and poſſeſſed of
good means of information, eſtimated forty years ago the money belonging
to that republic, in the Engliſh funds, at three hundred thouſand pounds, or
ſeven millions of Swiſs livres; and the ſums remaining in the treaſury of
Bern, or diſperſed through the other funds or banks of Europe, at eighteen
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0112200701:432"/>
hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, or forty-three millions Swiſs. Theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
have not probably diminiſhed ſince the year 1722. The Canton en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches
itſelf by the ſimple means of receiving much and expending little.
But what is the amount of its receipts? I know not, but I will try to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it. The twelve bailiwics, or diſtricts, of the Païs de Vaud pay, one
with another, during the ſix years that they are governed by the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
five hundred thouſand Swiſs livres. The contributions, therefore
of all the twelve amount to a million of livres annually, I have always
been told that the bailiffs, or governors, retain ten <hi>per cent.</hi> on the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
raiſed within their reſpective juriſdictions. The million of revenue,
diminiſhed by an hundred thouſand livres conſumed in the appointments of
the <hi>bailiffs,</hi> is reduced to three hundred thouſand crowns; of which one
hundred thouſand may be allowed for the expences of the ſtate, a ſum not
choſen at random; and the other two hundred thouſand crowns, which in
other countries would be employed in the maintenance of a court and army,
whoſe incomes would circulate through the general maſs of the people on
whom they had been raiſed, are here buried in the coffers of the ſovereignty,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0112200701:433"/>
or diſperſed through the precarious banks of Europe, to become one day
a prey to the knavery of a clerk, or the ambition of a conqueror. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
abſorption of ſpecie extinguiſhes induſtry, deadens every enterpriſe
that requires the aid of money, and gradually impoveriſhes the country.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, Sir, are your hardſhips. But I think you will ſay to me, <q>Have
you thus probed our wounds merely to make us feel their ſmart? What
advice do you give us?</q> None, unleſs you have already anticipated
it. I would indeed adviſe you to remonſtrate. But there are evils ſo deeply
rooted in governments, that Plato himſelf would deſpair of curing them.
What could you expect to obtain from thoſe maſters by remonſtrances, who
have remained during two centuries inſenſible to the merit of your faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
There is another remedy, more prompt, more perfect, and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
William Tell would have preſcribed it; I do not. I know that the ſpirit
of a good citizen is, like that of charity, long-ſuffering, and hoping all things.
The citizen is in the right; ſince he knows the evils reſulting from his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0112200701:434"/>
but knows not the greater evils which might be produced by his
reſiſtance. You know me too well to be ignorant how much I reſpect thoſe
principles, ſo friendly to the intereſts of peace and of human kind. I will
never, in the language of a ſeditious tribune, perſuade the people to ſhake
off the yoke of authority, that they may proceed from murmur to ſedition,
from ſedition to anarchy, and from anarchy perhaps to deſpotiſm.</p>
                  <p>Yet, with the freedom which has hitherto guided my pen, I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deſtroy ſome giants of romance, which might otherwiſe inſpire you
with vain terror. Whether you prefer the road of bold enterpriſe or cautious
repoſe, I wiſh that reaſon, not prejudice, ſhould dictate your choice.</p>
                  <p>The magiſtrates of Bern have a right to expect your obedience: you fear
to do them wrong in withholding it.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>FEAR no reproaches for your negligence, however great; for your
ſilence, however long. I love you too well to make you any.
Nothing, in my opinion, is ſo ridiculous as ſome kind of friends,
wives, and lovers, who look on no crime as ſo heinous as the letting
ſlip a poſt without writing. The charm of friendſhip is liberty; and
he that would deſtroy the one, deſtroys, without deſigning it, the
better half of the other. I compare friendſhip to charity, and letters
to alms; the laſt ſignifies nothing without the firſt, and very often
the firſt is very ſtrong, although it does not ſhew itſelf by the other.
It is not good-will which is wanting, it is only opportunities or
means. However, one month—two months—three months—four
months—I began not to be angry, but to be uneaſy, for fear ſome
accident had happened to you. I was often on the point of writing,
but was always ſtopped by the hopes of hearing from you the next
poſt. Beſides, not to flatter you, your excuſe is a very bad one.
<hi>You cannot entertain me by your letters.</hi> I think I ought to know
that better than you; and I aſſure you that one of <hi>your plain ſincere
letters</hi> entertains me more than the moſt poliſhed one of Pliny or
Cicero. 'Tis your heart ſpeaks, and I look on your heart as much
better in its way than either of their heads.</p>
               <p>Out of pure politeneſs I ought to talk of **** ********
before myſelf. I was ſome hours with him in this place, that is to
ſay, almoſt all the time he was here. I find him always ***
****, always good-natured, always amuſing, and always trifling.
I aſked him ſome queſtions about Italy; he told me, he hurried out
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0112200701:436"/>
of it as ſoon as he could, becauſe there was no French comedy, and
he did not love the Italian opera. I let ſlip ſome words of the
pleaſure he ſhould have of ſeeing his native country again, on
account of the ſervices he could render her in parliament. <q>Yes
(ſays he), I want vaſtly to be at London; there are three years
ſince I have ſeen Garrick.</q> He ſpoke to me of you, and indeed
not only with conſideration, but with affection. Were there nothing
elſe valuable in his character, I ſhould love him, becauſe he loves
you. He told me he intended to ſee you as ſoon as he ſhould be in
England; I am glad he has kept his word. I was ſo taken up with
my old friend, that I could not ſpeak a word to * * *.
He appeared, however, a good, ſenſible, modeſt young man. Poor
Minorca indeed thus loſt! but poor Engliſhmen who have loſt it!
I think the ſecond exclamation ſtill ſtronger than the firſt. Poor
Lord Torrington! I can't help pitying him. What a ſhameful
uncle he has! I ſhall loſe all my opinion of my countrymen, if the
whole nation, Whigs, Tories, Courtiers, Jacobites, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
are not unanimous in deteſting that man. Pray, is there any truth
in a ſtory we had here, of a brother of Admiral Byng's having
killed himſelf out of rage and ſhame? I did not think he had any
brothers alive. It is thought here that Byng will be acquitted. I
hope not. Though I do not love raſh judgments, I cannot help
thinking him guilty.</p>
               <p>You aſk me, when I ſhall come into England? How ſhould I know
it? The 14th of June I wrote to my father, and ſaying nothing of
my return, which I knew would have been to no purpoſe, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to give me a fixed allowance of 200l. a-year, or, at leaſt,
to allow me a ſervant. No anſwer. About a fortnight ago I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
my requeſt; and I cannot yet know what will be my ſucceſs.
I deſign to make a virtue of neceſſity, to keep quiet during this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to put in uſe all my machines next ſpring, in order to come
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0112200701:437"/>
over<note n="*" place="bottom">This Letter is a curious ſpecimen of the degree in which Mr. Gibbon had loſt the
Engliſh language in a ſhort time.</note>. I ſhall write the ſtrongeſt, and at the ſame time the moſt
dutiful letter I can imagine to my father. If all that produces no
effect, I don't know what I can do.</p>
               <p>You talk to me of my couſin Elliſon's wedding; but you don't
ſay a word of who ſhe is married to. Is it Elliot? Though you
have not ſeen my father yet, I ſuppoſe you have heard of him.
How was he in town? His wife, was ſhe with him? Has marriage
produced any changement in his way of living? Is he to be always
at Beriton, or will he come up to London in winter? Pray have
you ever ſeen my mother-in-law, or heard any thing more of her
character? Compliments to every body that makes me compliments:
to the Gilberts, to the Comarques, to Lord Newnham, &amp;c. When
you ſee the Comarques again, aſk them if they did not know, at
Putney, Monſieur la Vabre, and his daughters; perhaps you know
them yourſelf. I ſaw them lately in this country; one of them very
well married.</p>
               <p>The Engliſhman who lodges in our houſe, is little ſociable at leaſt
for a reaſonable perſon. My health always good, my ſtudies pretty
good. I underſtand Greek pretty well. I have even ſome kind of
correſpondence with ſeveral learned men, with Mr. Crevier of Paris,
with Mr. Breitinger of Zurick, and with Mr. Allamand, a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of this country, the moſt reaſonable divine I ever knew. Do
you never read now? I am a little piqued that you ſay nothing of
Sir Charles Grandiſon; if you have not read it yet, read it for my
ſake. Perhaps Clariſſa does not encourage you; but, in my opinion,
it is much ſuperior to Clariſſa. When you have read it, read the
letters of Madame de Sevigné to her daughter; I don't doubt of
their being tranſlated into Engliſh. They are properly what I called
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0112200701:438"/>
in the beginning of my letter, letters of the heart; the natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of a mother's fondneſs; regret at their being at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from one another, and continual ſchemes to get together again.
All that, won't it pleaſe you? There is ſcarce any thing elſe in ſix
whole volumes: and notwithſtanding that, few people read them
without finding them too ſhort. Adieu: my paper is at an end.
I don't dare to tell you to write ſoon. Do it, however, if you
can. Yours affectionately,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>AN addreſs in writing, from a perſon who has the pleaſure of
being with you every day, may appear ſingular. However, I
have preferred this method, as upon paper I can ſpeak without a
bluſh, and be heard without interruption. If my letter diſpleaſes
you, impute it, dear Sir, only to yourſelf. You have treated me,
not like a ſon, but like a friend. Can you be ſurpriſed that I ſhould
communicate to a friend, all my thoughts, and all my deſires? Unleſs
the friend approve them, let the father never know them; or at
leaſt, let him know at the ſame time, that however reaſonable, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
eligible, my ſcheme may appear to me, I would rather forget
it for ever, than cauſe him the ſlighteſt uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>When I firſt returned to England, attentive to my future intereſt,
you were ſo good as to give me hopes of a ſeat in parliament. This
ſeat, it was ſuppoſed would be an expence of fifteen hundred pounds.
This deſign flattered my vanity, as it might enable me to ſhine
in ſo auguſt an aſſembly. It flattered a nobler paſſion; I promiſed
myſelf that by the means of this ſeat I might be one day the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſome good to my country. But I ſoon perceived how little
a mere virtuous inclination, unaſſiſted by talents, could contribute
towards that great end; and a very ſhort examination diſcovered to
me, that thoſe talents had not fallen to my lot. Do not, dear Sir,
impute this declaration to a falſe modeſty, the meaneſt ſpecies of
pride. Whatever elſe I may be ignorant of, I think I know myſelf,
and ſhall always endeavour to mention my good qualities without
vanity, and my defects without repugnance. I ſhall ſay nothing of
the moſt intimate acquaintance with his country and language, ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0112200701:440"/>
neceſſary to every ſenator. Since they may be acquired, to
alledge my deficiency in them, would ſeem only the plea of lazineſs.
But I ſhall ſay with great truth, that I never poſſeſſed that gift of
ſpeech, the firſt requiſite of an orator, which uſe and labour may
improve, but which nature alone can beſtow. That my temper,
quiet, retired, ſomewhat reſerved, could neither acquire popularity,
bear up againſt oppoſition, nor mix with eaſe in the crowds of public
life. That even my genius (if you will allow me any) is better
qualified for the deliberate compoſitions of the cloſet, than for the
extemporary diſcourſes of the parliament. An unexpected objection
would diſconcert me; and as I am incapable of explaining to others,
what I do not thoroughly underſtand myſelf, I ſhould be meditating,
while I ought to be anſwering. I even want neceſſary prejudices of
party, and of nation. In popular aſſemblies, it is often neceſſary to
inſpire them; and never orator inſpired well a paſſion, which he did
not feel himſelf. Suppoſe me even miſtaken in my own character;
to ſet out with the repugnance ſuch an opinion muſt produce, offers
but an indifferent proſpect. But I hear you ſay, it is not neceſſary
that every man ſhould enter into parliament with ſuch exalted hopes.
It is to acquire a title the moſt glorious of any in a free country, and
to employ the weight and conſideration it gives, in the ſervice of
one's friends. Such motives, though not glorious, yet are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable;
and if we had a borough in our command, if you
could bring me in without any great expence, or if our fortune en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
us to deſpiſe that expence, then indeed I ſhould think them
of the greateſt ſtrength. But with our private fortune, is it worth
while to purchaſe at ſo high a rate, a title, honourable in itſelf, but
which I muſt ſhare with every fellow that can lay out fifteen hundred
pounds? Beſides, dear Sir, a merchandiſe is of little value to the
owner, when he is reſolved not to ſell it.</p>
               <p>I ſhould affront your penetration, did I not ſuppoſe you now ſee
the drift of this letter. It is to appropriate to another uſe the ſum
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0112200701:441"/>
with which you deſtined to bring me into parliament; to employ it,
not in making me great, but in rendering me happy. I have often
heard you ſay yourſelf, that the allowance you had been ſo indulgent
as to grant me, though very liberal in regard to your eſtate, was yet
but ſmall, when compared with the almoſt neceſſary extravagancies
of the age. I have indeed found it ſo, notwithſtanding a good deal
of oeconomy, and an exemption from many of the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of youth. This, dear Sir, would be a way of ſupplying
theſe deficiencies, without any additional expence to you.—But I
forbear.—If you think my propoſals reaſonable, you want no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
to engage you to comply with them; if otherwiſe, all will
be without effect.</p>
               <p>All that I am afraid of, dear Sir, is, that I ſhould ſeem not ſo
much aſking a favour, as this really is, as exacting a debt. After
all I can ſay, you will ſtill remain the beſt judge of my good, and
your own circumſtances. Perhaps, like moſt landed gentlemen,
an addition to my annuity would ſuit you better, than a ſum of
money given at once; perhaps the ſum itſelf may be too conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Whatever you ſhall think proper to beſtow upon me, or in
whatever manner, will be received with equal gratitude.</p>
               <p>I intended to ſtop here; but as I abhor the leaſt appearance of art,
I think it will be better to lay open my whole ſcheme at once. The
unhappy war which now deſolates Europe, will oblige me to defer
ſeeing France till a peace. But that reaſon can have no influence
upon Italy, a country which every ſcholar muſt long to ſee; ſhould
you grant my requeſt, and not diſapprove of my manner of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
your bounty, I would leave England this Autumn, and
paſs the Winter at Lauſanne, with M. de Voltaire and my old
friends. The armies no longer obſtruct my paſſage, and it muſt be
indifferent to you, whether I am at Lauſanne or at London during
the Winter, ſince I ſhall not be at Beriton. In the Spring I would
croſs the Alps, and after ſome ſtay in Italy, as the war muſt then
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0112200701:442"/>
be terminated, return home through France; to live happily with
you and my dear mother. I am now two-and-twenty; a tour muſt
take up a conſiderable time, and though I believe you have no
thoughts of ſettling me ſoon, (and I am ſure I have not,) yet ſo
many things may intervene, that the man who does not travel early,
runs a great riſk of not travelling at all. But this part of my
ſcheme, as well as the whole, I ſubmit entirely to you.</p>
               <p>Permit me, dear Sir, to add, that I do not know whether the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
compliance with my wiſhes could increaſe my love and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
but that I am very ſure, no refuſal could diminiſh thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents

               <p>SUPPOSING you ſettled in quarters, dear Sir, I obey your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and ſend you my thoughts, relating to the purſuit of your
mathematical ſtudies. You told me, you had read Clairaut's Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,
and the three firſt books of l'Hopital's Conic Sections. You
did not mention the Elements of Geometry you had peruſed. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were, whether Euclid's, or by ſome other, you will do
well, if you have not applied yourſelf that way for ſome time
paſt, to go over them again, and render the concluſions familiar to
your memory. You may defer, however, a very critical inquiry
into the principles and reaſoning of geometers, till Dr. Simpſon's
new edition of Euclid (now in the preſs) appears. I would have
you ſtudy that book well; in the mean time recapitulate Clairaut
and l'Hopital, ſo far as you have gone, and then go through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the marquis's books with care. The fifth book will be
an Introduction to the <hi>Analyſe des Infiniment petits;</hi> to which I
would adviſe you to proceed, after finiſhing the Conic Sections. The
<hi>Infiniment petits</hi> may want a comment; Crouſaz has written one, but
it is a wretched performance: he did not underſtand the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the ſcience he undertook to illuſtrate; and his geometry
ſhews, that he did not underſtand the firſt principles of geometry.
There is a poſthumous work of M. Varignon's, called <hi>Eclairciſſemens
ſur l' Analyſe des Infiniment petits.</hi> Paris, 1725, 4to. This will be often
of uſe to you. However, it muſt be owned, that the notion of the
<hi>Infiniment petits,</hi> or <hi>Infiniteſimals,</hi> as we call them, is too bold an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
and too remote from the principles of the ancients, our
maſters in geometry; and has given a handle to an ingenious author
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0112200701:446"/>
(Berkeley, late biſhop of Cloyne) to attack the logic of modern
mathematicians. He has been anſwered by many, but by none ſo
clearly as by Mr. Maclaurin, in his Fluxions, (2 vols. in 4to,) where
you will meet with a collection of the moſt valuable diſcoveries
in the mathematical and phyſico-mathematical ſciences. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this author to you; but whether you ought to read him
immediately after M. de l'Hopital, may be a queſtion. I think you
may be ſatisfied at firſt with reading his introduction, and chap. 1.
book I. of the grounds of the Method of Fluxions, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to chap. 12. of the ſame book, § 495 to § 505 incluſive, where
he treats of the Method of Infiniteſimals, and of the Limits of Ratios.
You may then read chap. 1. book II. § 697 to § 714 incluſive; and
this you may do immediately after reading the firſt ſection of the
<hi>Analyſe des Infiniment petits:</hi> or if you pleaſe, you may poſtpone a
critical inquiry into the principles of Infiniteſimals and Fluxions, till
you have ſeen the uſe and application of this doctrine in the drawing
of Tangents, and in finding the Maxima and Minima of Geometrical
Magnitudes. <hi>Annal. des Infin. pet.</hi> § 2 <hi>and</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>When you have read the beginning of l'Hopital's 4th ſect. to
ſect. 65 incluſive, you may read Maclaurin's chap. 2, 3, and 4;
where he fully explains the nature of theſe higher orders of Fluxions,
and applies the notion to geometrical figures. Your principles being
then firmly eſtabliſhed, you may finiſh M. de l'Hopital.</p>
               <p>Your next ſtep muſt be to the inverſe method of Fluxions, called
by the French <hi>calcul integral.</hi> Monſieur de Bougainville has given
us a treatiſe upon this ſubject, Paris, 1754, 4to. under the title
<hi>Traité du calcul integral pour ſervir de ſuite a l' Analyſe des Infiniment
petits.</hi> You ſhould have it; but though he explains the methods
hitherto found out for the determination of Fluents from given
Fluxions, or in the French ſtyle, <hi>pour trouver les integrales des dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
donneés;</hi> yet as he has not ſhewn the uſe and application of
this doctrine, as de l'Hopital did, with reſpect to that part which he
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0112200701:447"/>
treats of, M. de Bougainville's book is, for that reaſon, not ſo well
ſuited to beginners as could be wiſhed. You may therefore take
Carré's book in 4to, printed at Paris, 1700, and entitled, <hi>Methode
pour la Meſure des Surfaces,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>par l' Application du Calcul integral.</hi>
Only I muſt caution you againſt depending upon him in his fourth
ſection, where he treats of the centre of oſcillation and percuſſion;
he having made ſeveral miſtakes there, as M. de Mairan has ſhewn,
p. 196. <hi>Mem. de l' Acad. Royale des Sciences,</hi> edit. Paris, 1735. After
Carré, you may read Bougainville.</p>
               <p>I have recommended French authors to you, becauſe you are a
thorough maſter of that language, and becauſe, by their ſtudying
ſtyle and clearneſs of expreſſion, they ſeem to me beſt adapted to
beginners. Our authors are often profound and acute, but their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniſms,
and neglect of expreſſion, often perplex beginners. I
except Mr. Maclaurin, who is very clear; but then he has ſuch a
vaſt variety of matter, that a great part of his book is, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
too difficult for a beginner. I might recommend other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to you, as a courſe of elements; for inſtance, you might
read Mr. Thomas Simpſon's Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, and
Fluxions; all which contain a great variety of good things. In his
Geometry he departs from Euclid without a ſufficient reaſon. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
you may read him after Dr. Robert Simſon's Euclid, or
together with it, and take notice of what is new in Thomas Simpſon.
His Algebra you may join with Clairaut; and the rather that Clairaut
has been ſparing of particular problems, and has, beſides, omitted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
uſeful applications of Algebra. Simpſon's Fluxions may go hand
in hand with l'Hopital, Maclaurin, Carré, and Bougainville. If you
come to have a competent knowledge of theſe authors, you will be
far advanced, and you may proceed to the works of Newton, Cotes,
the Bernoulli's, Dr. Moivre, &amp;c. as your inclination and time will
permit. Sir Iſaac Newton's treatiſe of the Quadrature of Curves has
been well commented by Mr. Stewart, and is of itſelf a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:0112200701:448"/>
of Fluxions. Sir Iſaac's Algebra is commented in ſeveral
places by Clairaut, and in more in Maclaurin's Algebra; and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's
famous Principia are explained by the <hi>Minims Jacquirs et le
Seur,</hi> Geneva, 4 vols. 4to. Cotes is explained by Don Walmeſley,
in his <hi>Analyſe des Meſures,</hi> &amp;c. Paris, 4to. You ſee you may find
work enough. But my paper bids me ſubſcribe myſelf, dear Sir,</p>

                     <hi>P. S.</hi> But I recollect, a little late, that the books I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
excepting Newton's Principia, and the occaſional problems in
the reſt, treat only of the abſtract parts of the Mathematics; and
you are, no doubt, willing to look into the concrete parts, or what is
called Mixed Mathematics, and the Phyſico-mathematical Sciences.
Of theſe the principal are, mechanics, optics, and aſtronomy. As to
the principles of mechanics, M. d'Alembert has recommended M.
Trabaud's <hi>Principes du Mouvement et de l'Equilibre,</hi> to beginners;
and you cannot do better than to ſtudy this book. In optics we
have Dr. Smith's Complete Syſtem, 2 vols. 4to. I wiſh though, we
had a good inſtitution, ſhort and clear; the Doctor's book entering
into too great details for beginners. However, you may conſider his
firſt book, or popular Treatiſe, as an Inſtitution, and you will from
thence acquire a good deal of knowledge. In aſtronomy I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
M. le Monnier's <hi>Inſtitutions Aſtronomiques,</hi> in 4to. Paris, 1746.
It is a tranſlation from Keil's Aſtronomical Lectures, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
additions. You ſhould alſo have Caſſini's <hi>Elemens d' Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,</hi>
2 vols. 4to. As to the phyſical cauſes of the celeſtial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
after having read Maclaurin's account of Sir Iſaac Newton's
philoſophical Diſcoveries, and Dr. Pemberton's View of Sir Iſaac's
Philoſophy, you may read the great author himſelf, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But if you read Maclaurin's Fluxions throughout, you will
find many points of Sir Iſaac's philoſophy well explained there.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0112200701:449"/>
They theory of light and colours ſhould be ſtudied in Sir Iſaac him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in the Engliſh edition of his Optics, 8vo. there is a branch
of the optical ſciences which I have not mentioned, that is, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective.
Dr. Brook Taylor's is the beſt ſyſtem, but his ſtyle and
expreſſion is embarraſſed and obſcure. L'Abbé de la Caille has alſo
given a good treatiſe of Perſpective, at the end of his <hi>Optique:</hi> theſe
are of uſe to painters; but the theory of mathematical projection
in general is more extenſive, and has been well treated of by old
writers, Clavius, Aguillonius, Tacquet, and De Chules: and lately
M. de la Caille has given a memoir among thoſe of the <hi>Acad. Roy.
des Sciences</hi> of Paris, <hi>anno</hi> 1741, <hi>ſur le calcul des projections en ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
This ſubject is neceſſary for the underſtanding of the theory
of maps and planiſpheres. Mathematicians have alſo applied their
art to the theory of ſounds and muſic. Dr. Smith's Harmonics is
the principal book of the kind.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I given you ſome account of the principal elementary
authors in the different branches of mathematical knowledge, and
it were much to be wiſhed that we had a complete inſtitution, or
courſe, of all theſe things of a moderate ſize, which might ſerve as
an introduction to all the good original authors. Wolfius attempted
this; his intention was laudable, but his book is ſo full of errors of
the preſs, beſides ſome of his own, that I cannot recommend him
to a beginner. He might be uſed occaſionally for the ſignification
of terms, and for many hiſtorical facts relating to mathematics;
and, beſides, may be conſidered as a collector of problems, which
is uſeful.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the books I have mentioned, it might be of uſe to you to
have M. Montucla's <hi>Hiſtoire des Mathematiques,</hi> in 4to. 2. vols. You
will there find a hiſtory of the progreſs of the mathematical ſciences,
and ſome account of the principal authors relating to this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I mentioned to you in converſation, the ſuperior elegance of the
antient method of demonſtration. If you incline to examine this
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0112200701:450"/>
point, after being well verſed in Euclid, you may proceed to Dr.
Simſon's Conic Sections; and to form an idea of the antient analyſis
or method of inveſtigating the ſolution of geometrical problems, read
Euclid's Data, which Dr. Simſon will publiſh, together with his new
edition of Euclid; and then read his <hi>Loci Plani,</hi> in 4to. The elegance
of the method of the ancients is confeſſed; but it ſeems to require the
remembrance of a great multitude of propoſitions, and in complicated
problems it does not ſeem probable that it can be extended ſo far as
the algebraic method.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU remember our agreement,—ſhort and frequent letters. The
firſt part of the treaty you have no doubt of my obſerving. I
think I ought not to leave you any of the ſecond. <hi>A propos</hi> of
treaty: our definitive one was ſigned here yeſterday, and this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duke of Bridgewater and Mr. Neville went for London
with the news of it. The plenipotentiaries ſat up till ten o'clock
in the morning at the ambaſſador of Spain's ball, and then went to
ſign this treaty, which regulates the fate of Europe.</p>
               <p>Paris, in moſt reſpects, has fully anſwered my expectations. I
have a number of very good acquaintance, which increaſe every
day; for nothing is ſo eaſy as the making them here. Inſtead of
complaining of the want of them, I begin already to think of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a choice. Next Sunday, for inſtance, I have only three invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to dinner. Either in the houſes you are already acquainted,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0112200701:451"/>
you meet with people who aſk you to come and ſee them, or ſome
of your friends offer themſelves to introduce you. When I ſpeak of
theſe connections, I mean chiefly for dinner and the evening. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as yet, I am pretty much a ſtranger to, and I fancy ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſo; for Paris is divided into two ſpecies, who have but little
communication with each other. The one, who is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with the men of letters, dine very much at home, are glad to
ſee their friends, and paſs the evenings till about nine, in agreeable
and rational converſation. The others are the moſt faſhionable, ſup
in numerous parties, and always play, or rather game, both before
and after ſupper. You may eaſily gueſs which ſort ſuits me beſt.
Indeed, Madam, we may ſay what we pleaſe of the frivolity of the
French, but I do aſſure you, that in a fortnight paſſed at Paris, I
have heard more converſation worth remembering, and ſeen more
men of letters among the people of faſhion, than I had done in two
or three winters in London.</p>
               <p>Amongſt my acquaintance I cannot help mentioning M. Helvetius,
the author of the famous book <hi>de l' Eſprit.</hi> I met him at dinner at
Madame Geoffrin's, where he took great notice of me, made me a
viſit next day, has ever ſince treated me, not in a polite but a
friendly manner. Beſides being a ſenſible man, an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and the worthieſt creature in the world, he has a very pretty
wife, an hundred thouſand livres a year, and one of the beſt tables
in Paris. The only thing I diſlike in him is his great attachment to,
and admiration for, * * * *, whoſe character is indeed at Paris
beyond any thing you can conceive. To the great civility of this
foreigner, who was not obliged to take the leaſt notice of me, I muſt
juſt contraſt the behaviour of * * * * * *.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I RECEIVED your letter about twelve days after its date, owing, as
I apprehend, to Mr. Foley's negligence. My direction is, <hi>à

Monſieur Monſieur</hi> Gibbon, <hi>Gentilhomme Anglois à l' Hotel de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,
rue de Columbier, Fauxbourg St. Germains, à Paris.</hi> You ſee I am
ſtill in that part of the town; and indeed from all the intelligence I
could collect, I ſaw no reaſon to change, either on account of cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or pleaſantneſs. Madame Bontems, Mrs. Mallet's friend, and
a Marquis de Mirabeau, (I got acquainted with at her houſe,) have
acted a very friendly part; though all their endeavours have only
ſerved to convince me that Paris is unavoidably a very dear place. I
am ſorry to find my Engliſh cloaths look very foreign. The French
are now exceſſively long-waiſted. At preſent we are in mourning
for the Biſhop of Liege, the king's uncle; and expect ſoon another
of a ſingular nature, for the old Pretender, who is very ill. They
mourn for him, not as a crowned head, but as a relation of the
king's. I am doubtful how the Engliſh here will behave; indeed
we can have no difficulties, ſince we need only follow the example
of the Duke of Bedford.</p>
               <p>I have now paſſed nearly a month in this place, and I can ſay with
truth, that it has anſwered my moſt ſanguine expectations. The
buildings of every kind, the libraries, the public diverſions, take up
a great part of my time; and I have already found ſeveral houſes,
where it is both very eaſy and very agreeable to be acquainted.
Lady Harvey's recommendation to Madame Geoffrin was a moſt
excellent one. Her houſe is a very good one; regular dinners there
every Wedneſday, and the beſt company of Paris, in men of letters
and people of faſhion. It was at her houſe I connected myſelf with
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:0112200701:453"/>
M. Helvetius, who, from his heart, his head, and his fortune, is a
moſt valuable man.</p>
               <p>At his houſe I was introduced to the Baron d'Olbach, who is a
man of parts and fortune, and has two dinners every week. The
other houſes I am known in, are the Ducheſs d' Aiguillon's, Madame
la Comteſſe de Froulay's, Madame du Bocage, Madame Boyer,
M. le Marquis de Mirabeau, and M. de Foucemagn. All theſe
people have their different merit; in ſome I meet with good din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
in others, ſocieties for the evening; and in all, good ſenſe,
entertainment, and civility; which, as I have no favours to aſk, or
buſineſs to tranſact with them, is ſufficient for me. Their men of
letters are as affable and communicative as I expected. My letters
to them did me no harm, but were very little neceſſary. My book
had been of great ſervice to me, and the compliments I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
upon it would make me inſufferably vain, if I laid any ſtreſs
on them. When I take notice of the civilities I have received, I muſt
take notice too of what I have ſeen of a contrary behaviour. You
know how much I always built upon the Count de Caylus: he has
not been of the leaſt uſe to me. With great difficulty I have ſeen
him, and that is all. I do not, however, attribute his behaviour to
pride, or diſlike to me, but ſolely to the man's general character,
which ſeems to be a very odd one. De la Motte, Mrs. Mallet's
friend, has behaved very drily to me, though I have dined with
him twice. But I can forgive him a great deal, in conſideration of
his having introduced me to M. d'Augny (Mrs. Mallet's ſon). Her
men are generally angels or devils; but here I really think, without
being very prone to admiration, that ſhe has ſaid very little too much
of him. As far as I can judge, he has certainly an uncommon degree
of underſtanding and knowledge, and, I believe, a great fund of
honour and probity. We are very much together, and I think our
intimacy ſeems to be growing into a friendſhip. Next Sunday we
go to Verſailles; the king's guard is done by a detachment from
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0112200701:454"/>
Paris, which is relieved every four days; and as he goes upon this
command, it is a very good occaſion for me to ſee the palace. I
ſhall not neglect, at the ſame time, the opportunity of informing
myſelf of the French diſcipline.</p>
               <p>The great news at preſent is the arrival of a very extraordinary
perſon from the Iſle of France in the Eaſt Indies. An obſcure
Frenchman, who was lately come into the iſland, being very ill, and
given over, ſaid, that before he died he muſt diſcharge his conſcience
of a great burden he had upon it, and declared to ſeveral people, he
was the accomplice of Damien, and the very perſon who held the
horſes. Unluckily for him, the man recovered after this declaration,
was immediately ſent priſoner to Paris, and is juſt landed at Port
l'Orient, from whence he is daily expected here, to unravel the
whole myſtery of that dark affair. This ſtory (which at firſt was
laughed at) has now gained entire credit, and I apprehend muſt be
founded on real fact.</p>
               <p>A lady of Miſs Caryll's acquaintance has deſired me to convey the
incloſed letter to her. You will be ſo good as to ſend it over to Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holt.
I hope I need ſay nothing of my ſentiments towards our
friends at Beriton, nor of my readineſs to execute any of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
here.</p>

               <p>HURRY of running about, time taken up with ſeeing places, &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c. are excellent excuſes; but I fancy you will gueſs
that my lazineſs and averſion to writing to my beſt friend are the
real motives, and I am afraid you will have gueſſed right.</p>
               <p>We are at this minute in a moſt magnificent palace, in the middle
of a vaſt lake; ranging about ſuites of rooms without a ſoul to
interrupt us, and ſecluded from the reſt of the univerſe. We ſhall
ſit down in a moment to ſupper, attended by all the Count's houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
This is the fine ſide of the medal: turn to the reverſe. We
are got here wet to the ſkin; we have crawled about fine gardens
which rain and fogs prevented our ſeeing; and if to-morrow does
not hold up a little better, we ſhall be in ſome doubt whether we
can ſay we have ſeen theſe famous iſlands. Guiſe ſays yes, and I
ſay no. The Count is not here; we have our ſupper from a paultry
hedge alehouſe, (excuſe the bull,) and the ſervants have offered us
beds in the palace, purſuant to their maſter's directions.</p>
               <p>I hardly think you will like Turin; the court is old and dull;
and in that country every one follows the example of the court.
The principal amuſement ſeems to be, driving about in your coach
in the evening, and bowing to the people you meet. If you go
while the Royal Family is there, you have the additional pleaſure
of ſtopping to ſalute them every time they paſs. I had that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
fifteen times one afternoon. We were preſented to a lady who
keeps a public aſſembly, and a very mournful one it is; the few
women that go to it are each taken up by their ciciſbeo; and a poor
Engliſhman, who can neither talk Piedmontois nor play at Faro,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0112200701:456"/>
ſtands by himſelf without one of their haughty nobility doing him
the honour of ſpeaking to him. You muſt not attribute this account
to our not having ſtaid long enough to form connections. It is a
general complaint of our countrymen, except of Lord ***, who
has been engaged for about two years in the ſervice of a lady,
whoſe long noſe is her moſt diſtinguiſhing fine feature. The moſt
ſociable women I have met with are the king's daughters. I chatted
for about a quarter of an hour with them, talked about Lauſanne,
and grew ſo very free and eaſy, that I drew my ſnuff-box, rapped
it, took ſnuff twice (a crime never known before in the preſence
chamber), and continued my diſcourſe in my uſual attitude of my
body bent forwards, and my fore ſinger ſtretched out<note n="*" place="bottom">This attitude continued to be characteriſtic of Mr. Gibbon. The engraving in
the frontiſpiece of the Memoirs is taken from the figure of Mr. Gibbon cut with
ſciſſars by Mrs. Brown thirty years after the date of this letter. The extraordinary
talents of this lady have furniſhed as complete a likeneſs of Mr. Gibbon, as to perſon,
face, and manner, as can be conceived; yet it was done in his abſence.</note>. As it might
however have been difficult to keep up this acquaintance, I chiefly
employ my time in ſeeing places, which fully repaid me in pleaſure
the trouble of my journey. What entertained me the moſt, was the
muſeum and the citadel. The firſt is under the care of a M. Bartoli,
who received us, without any introduction, in the politeſt manner
in the world, and was of the greateſt ſervice to us, as I dare ſay he
will be to you. The citadel is a ſtupendous work; and when you
have ſeen the ſubterraneous part of it, you will ſcarcely think it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſuch a place can ever be taken. As it is however a regular one,
it does not pique my curioſity ſo much as thoſe irregular fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hewn out of the Alps, as Exiles, Feneſtrelles, and the Brunette
would have done, could we have ſpared the time neceſſary. Our
next ſtage from Turin has been Milan, where we were mere ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as it was not worth while to endeavour at forming connections
for ſo very few days. I think you will be ſurpriſed at the great
church, but infinitely more ſo at the regiment of Baden, which is in
the citadel. Such ſteadineſs, ſuch alertneſs in the men, and ſuch
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0112200701:457"/>
exactneſs in the officers, as exceeded all my expectations. Next Friday
I ſhall ſee the regiment reviewed by General Serbelloni. Perhaps
I may write a particular letter about it. From Milan we proceed
to Genoa, and thence to Florence. you ſtare—But really we find
it ſo inconvenient to travel like mutes, and to loſe a number of
curious things for want of being able to aſſiſt our eyes with our
tongues, that we have reſumed our original plan, and leave Venice
for next year. I think I ſhould adviſe you to do the ſame.</p>

I would certainly adviſe you to go there from Milan, which you
may very well perform in a day and half. Upon our return, we
found Lord Tilney and ſome other Engliſh in their way to Venice.
We heard a melancholy piece of news from them: Byng died at
Bologna a few days ago of a fever. I am ſure you will be all very
ſorry to hear it.</p>
                  <p>We expect a volume of news from you in relation to Lauſanne,
and in particular to the alliance of the Ducheſs with the Frog. Is it
already concluded? How does the bride look after her great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?
Pray embrace her and the adorable, if you can, in both our
names; and aſſure them, as well as all the <hi>Spring</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſociety of young ladies mentioned in the Memoirs.</note>, that we talk of
them very often, but particularly of a Sunday; and that we are ſo
diſconſolate, that we have neither of us commenced ciciſbeos as yet,
whatever we may do at Florence. We have drank the Ducheſs's
health, not forgetting the little woman on the top of Mount Cenis, in
the middle of the Lago Maggiore, &amp;c. &amp;c. I expect ſome account

                  <salute>DEAR HOLROYD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHY did I not leave a letter for you at Marſeilles? For a very
plain reaſon: becauſe I did not go to Marſeilles. But, as you
have moſt judiciouſly added, why did not I ſend one? Humph. I
own that nonpluſſes me a little. However, hearken to my hiſtory.
After revolving a variety of plans, and ſuiting them as well as
poſſible to time and finances, Guiſe and I at laſt agreed to paſs from
Venice to Lyons, ſwim down the Rhone, wheel round the ſouth of
France, and embark at Bourdeaux. Alas! At Lyons I received
letters which convinced me that I ought no longer to deprive my
country of one of her greateſt ornaments. Unwillingly I obeyed,
left Guiſe to execute alone the remainder of our plan, paſſed about
ten delicious days at Paris, and arrived in England about the end of
June. Guiſe followed me about two months afterwards, as I was
informed by an epiſtle from him, which, to his great aſtoniſhment,
I immediately anſwered. You perceive there is ſtill ſome virtue
amongſt men. <hi>Exempli gratiâ,</hi> your letter is dated Vienna, October
12th, 1765; it made its appearance at Beriton, Wedneſday evening,
October the 29th. I am at this preſent writing, ſitting in my library,
on Thurſday morning, between the hours of twelve and one. I
have ventured to ſuppoſe you ſtill at Berlin; if not, I preſume you
take care that your letters ſhould follow you. This ideal march to
Berlin is the only one I can make at preſent. I am under command;
and were I to talk of a third fally as yet, I know ſome certain people
who would think it juſt as ridiculous as the third ſally of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Don Quixote. All I ever hoped for was, to be able to take
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0112200701:459"/>
the field once more, after lying quiet a couple of years. I muſt
own that your executing your tour in ſo complete a manner gives
me a little ſelfiſh. If I make a ſummer's eſcape to Berlin, I
cannot hope for the companion I flattered myſelf with. I am ſorry
however I have ſaid ſo much; but as it is difficult to encreaſe your
Honour's proper notions of your own perfections, I will e'en let it
ſtand. Indeed I owed you ſomething for your account of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
reception my book has met with. I ſee there are people of
taſte at Vienna, and no longer wonder at your liking it. Since the
court is ſo agreeable, a thorough reformation muſt have taken place.
The ſtiffneſs of the Auſtrian etiquette, and the haughty magnificence
of the Hungarian princes, muſt have given way to more civilized
notions. You have (no doubt) informed yourſelf of the forces and
revenues of the empreſs. I think (however unfaſhionably) we
always eſteemed her. Have you loſt or improved that opinion.
Princes, like pictures to be admired, muſt be ſeen in their proper
point of view, which is often a pretty diſtant one. I am afraid you
will find it peculiarly ſo at Berlin.</p>
               <p>I need not deſire you to pay a moſt minute attention to the Auſtrian
and Pruſſian diſcipline. You have been bit by a mad ſerjeant as well
as myſelf; and when we meet, we ſhall run over every particular
which we can approve, blame, or imitate. Since my arrival, I
have aſſumed the auguſt character of Major, received returns, iſſued
orders, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I do not intend you ſhall have the honour of
reviewing my troops next ſummer. Three fourths of the men will
be recruits; and during my pilgrimage, diſcipline ſeems to have been
relaxed. But I ſummon you to fulfil another engagement. Make
me a viſit next ſummer. You will find here a bad houſe, a pleaſant
country in ſummer, ſome books, and very little <hi>ſtrange</hi> company.
Such a plan of life for two or three months muſt, I ſhould imagine,
ſuit a man who has been for as many years ſtruck from one end of
Europe to the other like a tennis-ball. At leaſt I judge of you by
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0112200701:460"/>
myſelf. I always loved a quiet, ſtudious, indolent life; but never
enjoyed the charms of it ſo truly, as ſince my return from an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
but fatiguing courſe of motion and hurry. However I ſhall
hear of your arrival, which can ſcarcely be ſo ſoon as January 1766,
and ſhall probably have the misfortune of meeting you in town ſoon
after. We may then ſettle any plans for the enſuing campaign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>En attendant,</hi> (admire me, this is the only ſcrap of foreign lingo I
have imported into this epiſtle—if you had ſeen that of Guiſe to
me!) let me tell you a piece of Lauſanne news. Nanette Grand is
married to Lieutenant-colonel Prevot. Grand wrote to me; and by
the next poſt I congratulated both father and daughter. There is
exactneſs for you. The Curchod (Madame Necker) I ſaw at Paris.
She was very fond of me, and the huſband particularly civil. Could
they inſult me more cruelly? Aſk me every evening to ſupper; go
to bed, and leave me alone with his wife—what an impertinent ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!
it is making an old lover of mighty little conſequence. She is
as handſome as ever, and much genteeler; ſeems pleaſed with her
fortune rather than proud of it. I was (perhaps indiſcreetly enough)
exalting Nanette d'Illens's good luck and the fortune. What fortune?
(ſaid ſhe, with an air of contempt)—not above twenty thouſand
livres a-year. I ſmiled, and ſhe caught herſelf immediately.—
<q>What airs I give myſelf in deſpiſing twenty thouſand livres a-year,
who a year ago looked upon eight hundred as the ſummit of my
wiſhes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt end this tedious ſcrawl. Let me hear from you: I think
I deſerve it. Believe me, Dear Holroyd, I ſhare in all your pleaſures,
and feel all your misfortunes. Poor Bolton! I ſaw it in the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper.
Is Ridley with you? I ſuſpect not: but if he is, aſſure him
I do not forget him though he does me. Adieu; and believe me,
moſt affectionately yours,</p>

                  <salute>DEAR HOLROYD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAPPENED to-night to ſtumble upon a very odd piece of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in the St. James's Chronicle; it related to the marriage
of a certain Monſieur Olroy<note n="*" place="bottom">The name was ſo ſpelt in the newſpapers.</note>, formerly Captain of Huſſars. I do
not know how it came into my head that this Captain of Huſſars
was not unknown to me, and that he might poſſibly be an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of yours. If I am not miſtaken in my conjecture, pray give
my compliments to him, and tell him from me, that I am at leaſt as
well pleaſed that he is married as if I were ſo myſelf. Aſſure him,
however, that though as a philoſopher I may prefer celibacy, yet as
a politician I think it highly proper that the ſpecies ſhould be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by the uſual method; aſſure him even that I am convinced,
that if celibacy is expoſed to fewer miſeries, marriage can alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
real happineſs, ſince domeſtic enjoyments are the ſource of
every other good. May ſuch happineſs, which is beſtowed on few,
be given to him; the tranſient bleſſings of beauty, and the more
durable ones of fortune, good ſenſe, and an amiable diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>I can eaſily conceive, and as eaſily excuſe you, if you have
thought mighty little this winter of your poor ruſticated friend. I
have been confined ever ſince Chriſtmas, and confined by a ſucceſſion
of very melancholy occupations. I had ſcarcely arrived at Beriton,
where I propoſed ſtaying only about a fortnight, when a brother of
Mrs. Gibbon's died unexpectedly, though after a very long and painful
illneſs. We were ſcarcely recovered from the confuſion which ſuch
an event muſt produce in a family, when my father was taken dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:0112200701:462"/>
ill, and with ſome intervals has continued ſo ever ſince.
I can aſſure you, my dear Holroyd, that the ſame event appears in
a very different light when the danger is ſerious and immediate; or
when, in the gaiety of a tavern dinner, we affect an inſenſibility that
would do us no great honour were it real. My father is now much
better; but I have ſince been aſſailed by a ſevere ſtroke—the loſs of
a friend. You remember, perhaps, an officer of our militia, whom
I ſometimes uſed to compare to yourſelf. Indeed, the compariſon
would have done honour to any one. His feelings were tender and
noble, and he was always guided by them: his principles were juſt
and generous, and he acted up to them. I ſhall ſay no more, and
you will excuſe my having ſaid ſo much, of a man with whom you
were unacquainted; but my mind is juſt now ſo very full of him,
that I cannot eaſily talk, or even think, of any thing elſe. If I know
you right, you will not be offended at my <hi>weakneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What rather adds to my uneaſineſs, is the neceſſity I am under of
joining our militia the day after to-morrow. Though the lively
hurry of ſuch a ſcene might contribute to divert my ideas, yet
every circumſtance of it, and the place itſelf, (which was that of his
reſidence,) will give me many a painful moment. I know nothing
would better raiſe my ſpirits than a viſit from you; the requeſt may
appear unſeaſonable, but I think I have heard you ſpeak of <hi>an uncle</hi>
you had near Southampton. At all events, I hope you will ſnatch a
moment to write to me, and give me ſome account of your preſent
ſituation and future deſigns. As you are now fettered, I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
you will not be ſuch a <hi>hic et ubique</hi>

little more of you next winter, than I have lately done, as I hope to
take a pretty long ſpell in town. I ſuppoſe Guiſe has often fallen in
your way: he has never once written to me, nor I to him: in the
country we want materials, and in London we want time. I ought
to recollect, that you even want time to read my unmeaning ſcrawl.
Believe, however, my dear Holroyd, that it is the ſincere expreſſion
of a heart entirely yours.</p>

about two; a very thin ſeaſon, every body gone to
Spa. In the evening I reached this place. My friend appears, as he
ever will, in a light truly reſpectable; concealing the moſt exquiſite
ſufferings under the ſhow of compoſure, and even cheerfulneſs, and
attempting, though with little ſucceſs, to confirm the weaker mind
of his partner. I find, my friend expreſſes ſo much uneaſineſs at
the idea of my leaving him again ſoon, that I cannot refuſe to paſs the
month here. If Mr. Scott, as I ſuppoſe, is at Beriton, he has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
too high a ſenſe of friendſhip not to excuſe my neglecting him.
I had ſome hopes of engaging Mr. and Mrs. Holroyd to make an
excurſion to Portſmouth, Iſle of Wight, Southampton, &amp;c. in which
caſe they would ſpend a few days at Beriton. A ſudden reſolution
was taken laſt night in favour of the tour. We ſet out, Mr. and

               <p>YOUR very elegant letter on the antiquity and authenticity of the
book of Daniel, (juſt now received,) finds me here, if not without
leiſure, yet without books, and therefore in no condition to enter far
into the depths of this controverſy; which indeed is the leſs neceſſary,
as every thing that relates to the ſubject will come of courſe to be
conſidered by my learned ſucceſſors in the new lecture. For as the
prophecies of Daniel make an important link in <hi>that chain, which,</hi> as
you ſay, <hi>has been let down from heaven to earth,</hi> (but not by the
author of the late ſermons, who brought into view only what he
had not invented,) the grounds on which their authority reſts will,
without doubt, be carefully examined, and, as I ſuppoſe, firmly
eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, and to make at leaſt ſome ſmall return for
the civility of your addreſs to me, I beg leave to trouble you with
two or three ſhort remarks, ſuch as occur to me on reading your
letter.</p>
               <p>Your main difficulties are theſe two: 1. That the author of the
book of Daniel is too clear for a prophet; as appears from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Perſian and Macedonian affairs: and, 2. too fabulous
for a contemporary hiſtorian; as is evident, you ſuppoſe, from his
miſtakes, particularly in the ſixth chapter.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt of theſe difficulties is an extraordinary one. For
why may not prophecy, if the inſpirer think fit, be as clear as
hiſtory? Scriptural prophecy, whence your idea of its obſcurity is
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0112200701:477"/>
taken, is <hi>occaſionally</hi> thus clear, I mean after the event; and Daniel's
prophecy of the revolutions in the Grecian empire, would have been
obſcure enough to Porphyry himſelf before it.</p>
               <p>But your opinion, after all, when you come to explain yourſelf,
really is, as one ſhould expect, that, as a prophet, Daniel is not
clear enough; for you enforce the old objection of Porphyry, by
obſerving, that where a pretended prophecy is clear to a certain
point of time, and afterwards obſcure and ſhadowy, there common
ſenſe leads one to conclude that the author of it was an impoſtor.</p>
               <p>This reaſoning is plauſible, but not concluſive, unleſs it be taken for
granted, that a prophecy muſt, in all its parts, be equally clear and
preciſe: whereas, on the ſuppoſition of real inſpiration, it may be
fit, I mean it may ſuit with the views of the inſpirer, to predict ſome
things with more perſpicuity, and in terms more obviouſly and
directly applicable to the events in which they were fulfilled, than
others. But further, this reaſoning, whatever force it may have,
has no place here; at leaſt you evidently beg the queſtion when
you urge it; becauſe the perſons you diſpute againſt maintain, that
the ſubſequent prophecies of Daniel are equally diſtinct with thoſe
preceding ones concerning the Perſian and Macedonian empires, at
leaſt ſo much of them as they take to have been fulfilled; and that
to judge of the reſt, we muſt wait for the concluſion of them.</p>
               <p>However, you admit that the ſuſpicion ariſing from the cleareſt
prophecy may be removed by direct poſitive evidence that it was
compoſed before the event. But then you carry your notions of
that evidence very far, when you require, <q>that the exiſtence of
ſuch a prophecy, prior to its accompliſhment, ſhould be proved
by the knowledge of its being generally diffuſed amongſt an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
nation previous to that period, and its public exiſtence
atteſted by an unbroken chain of authentic writers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What you here claim as a matter of <hi>right,</hi> is, without queſtion, very
deſirable, but ſhould, I think, be accepted, if it be given at all, as a
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0112200701:478"/>
matter of <hi>favour.</hi> For what you deſcribe is the utmoſt evidence that
the caſe admits: but what right have we in this, or any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
whatever of natural or revealed religion, to the utmoſt evidence?
Is it not enough that the evidence be ſufficient to induce a reaſonable
aſſent? and is not that aſſent reaſonable, which is given to real
evidence, though of an inferior kind, when uncontrolled by any
greater? And ſuch evidence we clearly have for the authenticity of
the book of Daniel, in the reception of it by the Jewiſh nation down
to the time of Jeſus, whoſe appeal to it ſuppoſes and implies that
reception to have been conſtant and general: not to obſerve, that
the teſtimony of Jeſus is further ſupported by all the conſiderations
that are alleged for his own divine character. To this evidence,
which is poſitive ſo far as it goes, you have nothing to oppoſe but
ſurmiſe and conjectures; that is, nothing that deſerves to be called
evidence. But I doubt, Sir, you take for granted that the claim of
inſpiration is never to be allowed, ſo long as there is a poſſibility of
ſuppoſing that it was not given.</p>
               <p>II. In the ſecond diviſion of your letter, which is longer, and
more elaborate, than the firſt, you endeavour to ſhew that the <hi>hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical</hi>
part of the book of Daniel, chiefly that of the ſixth chapter,
is falſe and fabulous, and as ſuch, confutes and overthrows the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical.</hi>
What you advance on this head, is contained under <hi>five</hi>
articles:</p>
               <p>1. You think it ſtrange that Daniel, or any other man, ſhould be
promoted to a ſecret office of ſtate, <hi>for his ſkill in divination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here, firſt, you forget that Joſeph was thus promoted for the
ſame reaſon. Or, if you object to this inſtance, what ſhould hinder
the promotion either of Joſeph or Daniel, (when their ſkill in divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had once brought them to the notice and favour of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,)

aſſuredly both theſe great men poſſeſſed, if we may believe the plain
part of their ſtory, which aſſerts of Joſeph, and indeed proves, that
he was in no common degree <hi>diſcreet and wiſe;</hi> and of Daniel,
that <hi>an excellent ſpirit was found in him;</hi> nay, that <hi>he had knowledge
and ſkill in all learning and wiſdom,</hi> over and above his <hi>underſtanding
in all viſions and dreams.</hi> In ſhort, Sir, though princes of old might
not make it a rule to chuſe their miniſters out of their ſoothſayers,
yet neither would their being ſoothſayers, if they were otherwiſe
well accompliſhed, prevent them from being miniſters. Juſt as in
modern times, though churchmen have not often, I will ſuppoſe,
been made officers of ſtate, even by bigotten princes, becauſe they
were churchmen; yet neither have they been always excluded from
ſerving in thoſe ſtations when they have been found eminently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for them.</p>
               <p>2. Your next exception is, that a combination could ſcarce have
been formed in the court of Babylon againſt the favourite miniſter,
(though ſuch factions are common in other courts,) becauſe the
courtiers of Darius <hi>muſt have apprehended that the piety of Daniel
would be aſſerted by a miraculous interpoſition;</hi> of which they had
ſeen a recent inſtance. And here, Sir, you expatiate with a little
too much complacency on the ſtrange indifference which the ancient
world ſhewed to the gift of miracles. You do not, I dare ſay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a ſerious anſwer to this charge; or if you do, it may be enough
to obſerve, what I am ſure your own reading and experience muſt
have rendered very familiar to you, that the ſtrongeſt belief, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of the mind, perpetually gives way to the inflamed ſelfiſh
paſſions; and that, when men have any ſcheme of intereſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
much at heart, they are not reſtrained from purſuing it, though
the ſcaffold and the axe ſtand before them in full view, and have
perhaps been ſtreaming but the day before with the blood of other
ſtate-criminals. I aſk not, whether miracles have ever <hi>actually</hi>
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:0112200701:480"/>
exiſted, but whether you do not think that multitudes have been
firmly <hi>perſuaded</hi> of their exiſtence; and yet their indifference about
them, is a fact which I readily concede to you.</p>
               <p>3. Your third criticiſm is directed againſt what is ſaid of <hi>the law
of the Medes and Perſians, that it altereth not;</hi> where I find nothing to
admire, but the extreme rigour of Aſiatic deſpotiſm. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this irrevocability of the law, when once promulgated by the
ſovereign, not as contrived to be a check on his will, but rather to
ſhew the irreſiſtible and fatal courſe of it. And this idea was ſo
much cheriſhed by the deſpots of Perſia, that, rather than revoke
the iniquitous law, obtained by ſurprize, for exterminating the Jews,
Ahaſuerus took the part, as we read in the book of Eſther, (and as
Baron Monteſquieu, I remember, obſerves,) to permit the Jews to
defend themſelves againſt the execution of it; whence we ſee how
conſiſtent this law is with the determination of the judges, quoted
by you from Herodotus, <q>that it was lawful for the king to do
whatever he <hi>pleaſed:</hi>
                  </q> for we underſtand that he did <hi>not</hi> pleaſe that
this law, when once declared by him, ſhould be altered.</p>
               <p>You add under this head, <q>May I not aſſert that the Greek
writers, who have ſo copiouſly treated of the affairs of Perſia,
have not left us the ſmalleſt veſtige of a reſtraint, equally inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the monarch and prejudicial to the people.</q> I have not
the Greek writers by me to conſult, but a common book I chance
to have at hand refers me to one ſuch veſtige, in a very eminent
Greek hiſtorian, Diodorus Siculus. <hi>Lowth's Comment. in loc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. A fourth objection to the hiſtoric truth of the book of Daniel is
taken, with more plauſibility, from the matter of this law, which, as
you truly obſerve, was very ſtrange for the king's counſellor to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
and for any deſpot whatever to enact.</p>
               <p>But, 1. I a little queſtion whether prayer was ſo conſtant and
conſiderable a part of Pagan worſhip as is ſuppoſed; and if it was
not, the prejudices of the people would not be ſo much ſhocked by
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0112200701:481"/>
this interdict as we are ready to think. Daniel indeed prayed three
times a day; but the idolaters might content themſelves with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now and then at a ſtated ſolemnity. It is clear, that when you
ſpeak of <hi>depriving men of the comforts, and prieſts of the profits, of
religion,</hi> you have Chriſtian, and even modern principles and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in your eye: perhaps in the <hi>comforts,</hi> you repreſented to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a company of poor inflamed Huguenots under perſecution; and
in the <hi>profits,</hi> the lucrative trade of popiſh maſſes. But be this as
it may, it ſhould be conſidered, 2. That this law could not, in the
nature of the thing, ſuppreſs all prayer, if the people had any great
propenſity to it. It could not ſuppreſs <hi>mental</hi> prayer; it could not
even ſuppreſs <hi>bodily</hi> worſhip, if performed, as it eaſily might be, in
the night, or in ſecret. Daniel, it was well known, was uſed to
pray in open day-light, and in a place expoſed to inſpection, from
his uſual manner of praying; which manner, it was eaſily concluded,
ſo zealous a votary as he was, would not change or diſcontinue, on
account of the edict. Laſtly, though the edict paſſed for thirty
days, to make ſure work, yet there was no doubt but the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
would be ſoon accompliſhed, and then it was not likely that
much care would be taken about the obſervance of it.</p>
               <p>All this put together, I can very well conceive that extreme envy
and malice in the courtiers might ſuggeſt the idea of ſuch a law, and
that an impotent deſpot might be flattered by it. Certainly, if what
we read in the third chapter be admitted, that <hi>one</hi> of theſe deſpots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
all people, nations, and languages, to worſhip his image on
pain of death, there is no great wonder that <hi>another</hi> of them ſhould
demand the excluſive worſhip of himſelf for a month; nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
he might think himſelf civil, and even bounteous to his gods,
when he left them a ſhare of the other eleven. For as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<q>
                     <l>"Nihil eſt quod credere de ſe</l>
                     <l>Non poſſit, cum laudatur diis aequa poteſtas.—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:0112200701:482"/>
5. A fifth, and what you ſeem to think the ſtrongeſt, objection
to the credit of the book of Daniel is, that <q>no ſuch perſon as
Darius the Mede is to be found in the ſucceſſion of the Babyloniſh
princes,</q> (you mean as given in Ptolemy's canon and the Greek
writers,) <q>between the time of Nebuchadnezzar and that of Cyrus.</q>
In ſaying this, you do not forget or diſown what our ableſt chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
have ſaid on the ſubject; but then you object that Xenophon's
Cyaxares (to ſerve a turn) has been made to perſonate Darius the
Mede; and yet that Xenophon's book, whether it be a romance or
a true hiſtory, overturns the uſe which they have made of this
hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>I permit myſelf perhaps to be too much flattered by your civility
in referring me to my own taſte, rather than to the authority of
Cicero: but the truth is, I am much diſpoſed to agree with you,
that, <q>if we unravel with any care the ſine texture of the Cyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poedia,
we ſhall diſcover in every thread the Spartan diſcipline
and the philoſophy of Socrates.</q> But then, as the judicious
author choſe to make ſo recent a ſtory as that of Cyrus, and one ſo well
known, the vehicle of his political and moral inſtructions, he would
be ſure to keep up to the truth of the ſtory as far as might be; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the leading facts, and in the principal perſons, as we may
ſay, of the drama. This obvious rule of decorum ſuch a writer as
Xenophon could not fail to obſerve; and therefore, on the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that his Cyropoedia is a romance, I ſhould conclude certainly
that the outline of it was genuine hiſtory. But,</p>
               <p>2. If it be ſo, you conclude that there is no ground for thinking
that Darius the Mede ever reigned at Babylon, becauſe Cyaxares
himſelf never reigned there.</p>
               <p>Now, on the idea of Xenophon's book being a romance, there
might be good reaſon for the author's taking no notice of the ſhort
reign of Cyaxares, which would break the unity of his work, and
divert the reader's attention too much from the hero of it: while yet
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:0112200701:483"/>
the omiſſion could hardly ſeem to violate hiſtoric truth, ſince the
luſtre of his hero's fame, and the real power, which, out of queſtion,
he reſerved to himſelf, would make us forget or overlook Cyaxares.
But, as to the fact, it ſeems no way incredible that Cyrus ſhould
concede to his royal ally, his uncle, and his father-in-law, (for he
was all theſe,) the <hi>nominal</hi> poſſeſſion of the ſovereignty; or that he
ſhould <hi>ſhare</hi> the ſovereignty with him; or, at leaſt, that he ſhould
leave the <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> as we ſay, in his hands at Babylon, while
he himſelf was proſecuting his other conqueſts at a diſtance. Any
of theſe things is ſuppoſable enough; and I would rather admit any
of them than reject the expreſs, the repeated, the circumſtantial
teſtimony of a not confeſſedly fabulous hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>After all, Sir, I ſhould forfeit, I know, your good opinion, if I
did not acknowledge that ſome, at leaſt, of theſe circumſtances are
ſuch as one ſhould not, perhaps, expect at firſt ſight. But then ſuch
is the condition of things here; and what is true in human life, is
not always, I had almoſt ſaid, not often, that which was previouſly
to be expected; whence an ordinary romance is, they ſay, more
<hi>probable</hi> than the beſt hiſtory.</p>
               <p>But ſhould any or all of theſe circumſtances convince you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
that ſome degree of error or fiction is to be found in the book
of Daniel, it would be too precipitate to conclude that therefore the
whole book was of no authority: for, at moſt, you could but infer,
that the hiſtorical part, in which thoſe circumſtances are obſerved,
namely, the 6th chapter, is not genuine; juſt as you know has been
judged of ſome other hiſtorical tracts which had formerly been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in the book of Daniel. For it is not with theſe collections,
which go under the names of the Prophets, as with ſome regularly
connected ſyſtem, where a charge of falſehood, if made good againſt
one part, ſhakes the credit of the whole. Fictitious hiſtories may
have been joined to true prophecies, when all that bore the name of
the ſame perſon, or any way related to him, came to be put together
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:0112200701:484"/>
in the ſame volume: but the detection of ſuch miſalliance could
not affect the prophecies; certainly not thoſe of Daniel, which
reſpect <hi>the latter times;</hi> for theſe have an intrinſic evidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and aſſert their own authenticity, in proportion as we ſee, or
have reaſon to admit the accompliſhment of them.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, I have only to commit theſe haſty reflections to
your candour; a virtue which cannot be ſeparated from the love of
truth, and of which I obſerve many traces in your agreeable letter;
and if you ſhould indulge this quality ſtill further, ſo as to conceive
the poſſibility of that being <hi>true and reaſonable,</hi> in matters of religion,
which may ſeem ſtrange, or, to ſo lively a fancy as yours, even ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
you would not hurt the credit of your excellent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and would thus remove one, perhaps a principal, occaſion of
thoſe miſts which, as you complain, <hi>hang over theſe nice and difficult
ſubjects.</hi>

Mr. GIBBON's handwriting.</head>
                  <p>YOUR anſwers to my five objections againſt the 6th chapter of
Daniel come next to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>1. With regard to Daniel's promotion, I conſent to withdraw my
oppoſition, and to allow the eaſes of Ximenes, Wolſey, and Richlieu
as parallel inſtances; though there is ſurely ſome difference between
a young foreign ſoothſayer being <hi>ſuddenly</hi> rewarded, for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of a dream, with the government of Babylon, and a prieſt
of the eſtabliſhed church, riſing gradually to the great offices of
ſtate.</p>
                  <p>2. You apprehend, Sir, that my ſecond objection ſcarcely deſerves
a ſerious anſwer; and that it is quite ſufficient to appeal to my own
reading and experience, whether <hi>the ſtrongeſt conviction of the mind
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0112200701:485"/>
does not perpetually give way to the inflamed and ſelfiſh paſſions.</hi> Since
you appeal to me, I ſhall fairly lay before you the reſult of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
on that ſubject. 1. It muſt be confeſſed that the drunkard
often ſinks into the grave, and the prodigal into a gaol, without a
poſſibility of deceiving or of checking themſelves. But they ſink by
ſlow degrees; and, whilſt they indulge the ruling paſſion, attend
only to the trifling moment of each guinea, or of each bottle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
calculating their accumulated weight, till they feel themſelves
irretrievably cruſhed under it. 2. In moſt of the hazardous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
of life there is a mixture of chance and good fortune; what is
called good fortune, is often the effect of ſkill: and as our vanity
flatters us into an opinion of our ſuperior merit, we are neither ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
nor diſmayed by the miſcarriage of our raſh predeceſſors.
<hi>The conſpirator turns his eyes from the axe and ſcaffold, perhaps ſtill
ſtreaming with blood,</hi> to the ſucceſsful boldneſs of Sylla, of Caeſar,
and of Cromwell; and convinces himſelf that on ſuch a golden pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
it is even <hi>prudent</hi> to ſtake a precarious and inſipid life. We may
add, that the moſt daring flights of ambition are as often the effects
of neceſſity as of choice. The princes of Hindoſtan muſt either
reign or periſh; and when Caeſar paſſed the Rubicon, it was ſcarcely
poſſibly for him to return to a private ſtation. 3. You think, Sir,
we may learn from our own experience, that an indifference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
miracles is very compatible with a full conviction of their
truth; and ſo it undoubtedly is with ſuch a conviction as we have
an opportunity of obſerving.</p>

What are the trees and waters of Sheffield-Place, compared

               <p>I AM full of worldly cares, anxious about the great twenty-fourth,
plagued with the Public Advertiſer, diſtreſſed by the moſt diſmal
diſpatches from Hugonin. Mrs. Lee claims a million of repairs,
which will coſt a million of money.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons ſat late laſt night. Burgoyne made
ſome ſpirited motions—<q>That the territorial acquiſitions in India
belonged to the ſtate (that was the word); that grants to the
ſervants of the company (ſuch as jaghires) were illegal; and that
there would be no true repentance without reſtitution.</q> Wedder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne
defended the nabobs with great eloquence, but little argument.
The motions were carried without a diviſion; and the hounds
go out again next Friday. They are in high ſpirits; but the more
ſagacious ones have no idea they ſhall kill. Lord North ſpoke for
the inquiry, but faintly and reluctantly. Lady * is ſaid
to be in town at her mother's, and a ſeparation is unavoidable; but
there is nothing certain.</p>

               <p>I BEG ten thouſand pardons for not being dead, as I certainly ought
to be. But ſuch is my abject nature, that I had rather live in
Bentinck-ſtreet, attainted and convicted of the ſin of lazineſs, than
enjoy your applauſe either at old Nick's or even in the Elyſian Fields.
After all, could you expect that I ſhould honour with my corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
a wild barbarian of the Bogs of Erin? Had the natives
intercepted my letter, the terrors occaſioned by ſuch unknown magic
characters might have been fatal to you. But now you have eſcaped
the fury of their hoſpitality, and are arrived among a cee-vi-leezed
nation, I may venture to renew my intercourſe.</p>
               <p>You tell me of a long liſt of dukes, lords, and chieftains of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown
to whom you are introduced; were I with you, I ſhould
prefer one <hi>David</hi> to them all. When you are at Edinburgh, I hope
you will not fail to viſit the ſtye of that fatteſt of Epicurus's hogs,
and inform yourſelf whether there remains no hope of its reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the uſe of its right paw. There is another animal of <hi>great,</hi>
though not perhaps of <hi>equal,</hi> and certainly not of <hi>ſimilar</hi> merit,
one Robertſon; has he almoſt created the new world? Many other
men you have undoubtedly ſeen, in the country where you are at
preſent, who muſt have commanded your eſteem: but when you
return, if you are not very honeſt, you will poſſeſs great advantages
over me in any diſpute concerning Caledonian merit.</p>
               <p>Boodle's and Atwood's are now no more. The laſt ſtragglers,
and Godfrey Clarke in the rear of all, are moved away to their
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:0112200701:492"/>
ſeveral caſtles; and I now enjoy, in the midſt of London, a delicious
ſolitude. My library, Kenſington Gardens, and a few parties with
new acquaintance who are chained to London, (among whom I
reckon Goldſmith and Sir Joſhua Reynolds,) fill up my time, and
the monſter <hi>Ennui</hi> preſerves a very reſpectful diſtance. By the bye,
your friends Batt, Sir John Ruſſell, and Laſcelles, dined with me one
day before they ſet off; for I ſometimes give the prettieſt little dinner
in the world. But all this compoſure draws near its concluſion.
About the ſixteenth of this month Mr. Eliot carries me away, and after
picking up Mrs. Gibbon at Bath, ſets me down at Port Eliot: there
I ſhall certainly remain ſix weeks, or, in other words, to the end of
September. My future motions, whether to London, Derbyſhire,
or a longer ſtay in Cornwall, (pray is not "motion to ſtay" rather
in the Hibernian ſtyle?) will depend on the life of Port Eliot, the
time of the meeting of parliament, and perhaps the impatience of
Mr. *, Lord of Lenborough. One of my pleaſures in
town I forgot to mention, the unexpected viſit of Deyverdun, who
accompanies his young lord (very young indeed!) on a two months
tour to England. He took the opportunity of the Earl's going
down to the Duke of *, to ſpend a fortnight (nor do
I recollect a more pleaſant one) in Bentinck-ſtreet. They are now
gone together into Yorkſhire, and I think it doubtful whether I
ſhall ſee him again before his return to Leipſic. It is a melancholy
reflection, that while one is plagued with acquaintance at the corner
of every ſtreet, real friends ſhould be ſeparated from each other by
unſurmountable bars, and obliged to catch at a few tranſient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of interview. I deſire that you and my Lady (whom I
moſt reſpectfully greet) would take your ſhare of that very new
and acute obſervation, not ſo large a ſhare indeed as my Swiſs friend,
ſince nature and fortune give <hi>us</hi> more frequent opportunities of being
together. You cannot expect news from a deſart, and ſuch is
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0112200701:493"/>
London at preſent. The papers give you the full harveſt of public
intelligence; and I imagine that the eloquent nymphs of Twicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs Cambridges.</note>
communicate all the tranſactions of the polite, the amorous,
and the marrying world. The great pantomime of Portſmouth was
univerſally admired; and I am angry at my own lazineſs in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting
an excellent opportunity of ſeeing it. Foote has given us
the Bankrupt, a ſerious and ſentimental piece, with very ſevere
ſtrictures on the licence of ſcandal in attacking private characters.
Adieu. Forgive and epiſtolize me. I ſhall not believe you ſincere
in the former, unleſs you make Bentinck-ſtreet your inn. I fear
I ſhall be gone; but Mrs. Ford<note n="†" place="bottom">His houſekeeper.</note> and the parrot will be proud to
receive you and my Lady after your long peregrination, from
which I expect great improvements. Has ſhe got the brogue upon

               <p>BY this time you have ſurely finiſhed your tour, touched at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
where you found a letter, which you have not anſwered,
and are now contemplating the beauties of the Weald of Suſſex. I
ſhall demand a long and particular account of your peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but will excuſe it till we meet; and for the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
only a ſhort memorandum of your health and ſituation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

A word too, if you pleaſe, concerning father and ſiſter; to
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:0112200701:494"/>
the latter I encloſe a receipt from Mrs. G. who is now with me at
Port Eliot.</p>
               <p>Blind as you accuſe me of being to the beauties of nature, I am
wonderfully pleaſed with this country. Of her three dull notes,
<hi>ground, plants,</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> Cornwall poſſeſſes the firſt and laſt in
very high perfection. Think of a hundred ſolitary ſtreams peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
gliding between amazing cliffs on one ſide, and rich meadows
on the other, gradually ſwelling by the aid of the tide into noble
rivers, ſucceſſively loſing themſelves in each other, and all at length
terminating in the harbour of Plymouth, whoſe broad expanſe is
irregularly <hi>dotted</hi> with two-and-forty line of battle ſhips. In plants
indeed we are deficient; and though all the gentlemen now attend
to poſterity, the country will for a long time be very naked. We
have ſpent ſeveral days agreeably enough in little parties; but in
general our time rolls away in complete uniformity. Our landlord
poſſeſſes neither a pack of hounds, nor a ſtable of running horſes,
nor a large farm, nor a good library. The laſt only could intereſt
me; but it is ſingular that a man of fortune, who chooſes to
paſs nine months of the year in the country, ſhould have none of
them.</p>
               <p>According to our preſent deſign, Mrs. G. and myſelf return to
Bath about the beginning of next month. I ſhall probably make
but a ſhort ſtay with her, and defer my Derbyſhire journey till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
year. Sufficient for the ſummer is the evil thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> one
diſtant country excurſion. Natural inclination, the proſecution of
my great work, and the concluſion of my Lenborough buſineſs,
plead ſtrongly in favour of London. However I deſire, and one
always finds time for what one really deſires, to viſit Sheffield-Place
before the end of October, ſhould it only be for a few days.
I know ſeveral houſes where I am invited to think myſelf at home,
but I know no other where I ſeem inclined to accept of the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

I forgot to tell you, that I have declined the publication of
Lord Cheſterfield's Letters. The public will ſee them, and upon
the whole, I think, with pleaſure; but the family were ſtrongly
bent againſt it; and eſpecially on Deyverdun's account, I deemed
it more prudent to avoid making them my perſonal enemies.</p>

a verdict for our client, his cauſe was but a bad one. It is a very

under your conduct I am ſure they would, and I have freely offered
him your aſſiſtance, in caſe he ſhould wiſh to apply for it.</p>

polite firmneſs, the <hi>immediate</hi> choice of Chancery or arbitration.</p>
               <p>For the time, however, I forgot all theſe difficulties, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

The other day we had a briſk report of a Spaniſh war. It

               <p>I BEGIN to flag, and though you already reproach me as a bad
correſpondent, I much fear that I ſhall every week become a
more hardened ſinner. Beſides the occaſional obſtructions of Clarke
and Deyverdun, I muſt intreat you to conſider, with your uſual
candour, 1. The averſion to epiſtolary converſation, which it has
pleaſed the daemon to implant in my nature. 2. That I am a very
fine gentleman, a ſubſcriber to the maſquerade, where you and my
Lady ought to come, and am now writing at Boodle's, in a fine velvet
coat, with ruffles of my lady's chooſing, &amp;c. 3. That the aforeſaid
fine gentleman is likewiſe an hiſtorian; and in truth, when I am
writing a page, I do not only think it a ſufficient reaſon for delay, but
even conſider myſelf as writing for you, and that, much more to the
purpoſe than if I were ſending you the little tattle of the town, of
which indeed there is none ſtirring. With regard to America, the
Miniſter ſeems moderate, and the Houſe obedient.</p>

have a ſtick. But the curſed buſineſs of Lenborough, in the midſt

               <p>LAST night was the triumph of Boodle's. Our maſquerade coſt
two thouſand guineas; a ſum that might have fertiliſed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
(I ſpeak in your own ſtyle,) vaniſhed in a few hours, but
not without leaving behind it the fame of the moſt ſplendid and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<hi>féte,</hi> that was perhaps ever given in a ſeat of the arts and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
It would be as difficult to deſcribe the magnificence of the
ſcene, as it would be eaſy to record the humour of the night. The
one was above, the other below, all relation. I left the Pantheon
about five this morning, roſe at ten, took a good walk, and returned
home to a more rational entertainment of Batt, Sir John Ruſſell, and
Laſcelles, who dined with me. They have left me this moment; and
were I to enumerate the things ſaid of Sheffield, it would form a
much longer letter than I have any inclination to write. Let it
ſuffice, that Sir John means to paſs in Suſſex the interval of the two
terms. Every thing, in a word, goes on very pleaſantly, except
the terreſtrial buſineſs of Lenborough. Laſt Saturday ſe'nnight I
wrote to * * * *, to preſs him to ſee * * *, and urge the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration.
He has not <hi>condeſcended</hi> to anſwer me. All is a dead

               <p>DO you remember that there exiſts in the world one Edward
Gibbon, a houſekeeper in Bentinck-ſtreet? If the ſtandard
of writing and of affection were the ſame, I am ſure he would ill-deſerve
it. I do not wiſh to diſcover, how many days (I am afraid
I ought to uſe another word) have elapſed ſince the date of my laſt,
or even of your laſt letter, and yet ſuch is the ſluggiſh nature of the
beaſt, that I am afraid nothing but the arrival of Mrs. Bonfoy, and
the expectation of Mr. Eliot, could have rouſed me from my le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy.
The Lady gave me great ſatisfaction, by her general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of your health and ſpirits, but communicated ſome uneaſineſs,
by the mention of a little encounter, in the ſtyle of one of Don
Quixote's, but which proved, I hope, as trifling as you at firſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
it. For my own part, I am well in mind and body, buſy
with my books, (which may perhaps produce ſomething next year,
either to tire or amuſe the world,) and every day more ſatisfied with
my preſent mode of life, which I always believed was calculated to
make me happy. My only remaining uneaſineſs is Lenborough,
which is not terminated. By Holroyd's advice, I rather try what
may be obtained by a little more patience, than ruſh at once into
the horrors of Chancery. But let us talk of ſomething elſe. Mrs.
Porten grows younger every day. You remember, I think, in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ſtreet,
an agreeable woman, Miſs W ****. The Under-ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
is ſeriouſly in love with her, and ſeriouſly uneaſy that his preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſituation precludes him from happineſs. We ſhall ſoon ſee which
will get the better, love or reaſon. I bet three to two on love.</p>

Gueſs my ſurpriſe, when Mrs. Gibbon of Northamptonſhire ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
communicated her arrival. I immediately went to Surrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,
where ſhe lodged, but though it was no more than half
an hour after nine, the Saint had finiſhed her evening devotions,
and was already retired to reſt. Yeſterday morning (by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
I breakfaſted with her at eight o'clock, dined with her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
at two in Newman-ſtreet, and am juſt returned from ſetting her
down. She is, in truth, a very great curioſity: her dreſs and figure
exceed any thing we had at the maſquerade: her language and ideas
belong to the laſt century. However, in point of religion ſhe was
rational; that is to ſay, ſilent. I do not believe that ſhe aſked a
ſingle queſtion, or ſaid the leaſt thing concerning it. To me ſhe
behaved with great cordiality, and <hi>in her way</hi> expreſſed a great
regard.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Porten tells me, that ſhe has juſt written to you. She ought
to go to a maſquerade once a year. Did you think her ſuch a girl?</p>

               <p>WE go on with regard to America, if we can be ſaid to go on;
for on laſt Monday a conciliatory motion of allowing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
to tax themſelves, was introduced by Lord North, in the midſt
of lives and fortunes, war and famine. We went into the Houſe in
confuſion, every moment expecting that the Bedfords would fly into
rebellion againſt thoſe meaſures. Lord North roſe ſix times to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the ſtorm, but all in vain; till at length Sir Gilbert declared
for adminiſtration, and the troops all rallied under their proper
ſtandard. On Wedneſday we had the Middleſex election. I was a
patriot; ſat by the Lord Mayor, who ſpoke well, and with temper,
but before the end of the debate fell faſt aſleep. I am ſtill a mute;
it is more tremendous than I imagined; the great ſpeakers fill me
with deſpair, the bad ones with terror.</p>
               <p>When do you move? My Lady anſwered like a woman of ſenſe,
ſpirit, and good nature. Neither ſhe nor I could bear it. She
was right, and the Ducheſs of Braganza would have made the ſame

               <p>I HARDLY know how to take up the pen. I talked in my laſt of
two or three poſts, and I am almoſt aſhamed to calculate how
many have elapſed. I will endeavour for the future to be leſs ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.
Only believe that my heart is innocent of the lazineſs of
my hand. I do not mean to have recourſe to the ſtale and abſurd
excuſe of buſineſs, though I have really had a very conſiderable
hurry of new parliamentary buſineſs: one day, for inſtance, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
hours, from ten in the morning till between three and four
the next morning. It is, upon the whole, an agreeable improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in my life, and forms juſt the mixture of buſineſs, of ſtudy,
and of ſociety, which I always imagined I ſhould, and now find I
do like. Whether the Houſe of Commons may ever prove of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to myſelf or country, is another queſtion. As yet I have been
mute. In the courſe of our American affairs, I have ſometimes had
a wiſh to ſpeak, but though I felt tolerably prepared as to the matter,
I dreaded expoſing myſelf in the manner, and remained in my ſeat
ſafe, but inglorious. Upon the whole, (though I ſtill believe I ſhall
try,) I doubt whether Nature, not that in ſome inſtances I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
has given me the talents of an orator, and I feel that I
came into parliament much too late to exert them. Do you hear of
Port Eliot coming to Bath? and, above all, do you hear of Charles-ſtreet<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. Gibbon's reſidence at Bath.</note> coming to Bentinck-ſtreet, in its way to Eſſex, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I ACCEPT of the Pomeranian Lady with gratitude and pleaſure, and
ſhall be impatient to form an acquaintance with her. My pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
at St. James's paſſed graciouſly. My dinner at Twicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
was attended with leſs ceremony and more amuſement. If
they turned out Lord North to-morrow, they would ſtill leave him
one of the beſt companions in the kingdom. By this time I ſuppoſe
the Eliots are with you. I am ſure you will ſay every thing kind and
proper on the occaſion. I am glad to hear of the approbation of my
conſtituents for my vote on the Middleſex election. On the ſubject
of America, I have been ſomething more of a courtier. You know,
I ſuppoſe, that Holroyd is juſt ſtepped over to Ireland for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.
He paſſed three days with me on his way. Deyverdun had
left me juſt before your letter arrived, which I ſhall ſoon have an
opportunity of conveying to him. Though, I flatter myſelf, he broke
from me with ſome degree of uneaſineſs, the engagement could not
be declined. At the end of four years he has an annuity of one
hundred pounds for life, and may for the remainder of his days
enjoy a decent independence in that country, which a philoſopher
would perhaps prefer to the reſt of Europe. For my own part,
after the hurry of the town and of parliament, I am now retired to
my villa in Bentinck-ſtreet, which I begin to find a very pleaſing
ſolitude, at leaſt as well as if it were two hundred miles from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;

               <p>YOUR apprehenſions of a precipitate work, &amp;c. are perfectly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
I ſhould be much more addicted to a contrary extreme.
The <hi>head</hi> is now printing: true, but it was written laſt year and the
year before. The firſt chapter has been compoſed <hi>de nouveau three
times;</hi> the ſecond <hi>twice,</hi> and all the others have undergone reviews,
corrections, &amp;c. As to the tail, it is perfectly formed and digeſted,
(and were I ſo much given to ſelf-content and haſte,) it is almoſt
all written. The eccleſiaſtical part, for inſtance, is written out in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ſheets, which I mean to <hi>refondre</hi> from beginning to end. As
to the friendly critic, it is very difficult to find one who has leiſure,
candour, freedom, and knowledge ſufficient. However, Batt and
Deyverdun have read and obſerved. After all, the public is the beſt
critic. I print no more than five hundred copies of the firſt edition;
and the ſecond (as it happens frequently to my betters) may receive
many improvements. So much for Rome. We have nothing new
from America. But I can venture to aſſure you, that adminiſtration
is now as unanimous and decided as the occaſion requires. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will be done this year; but in the Spring the force of the
country will be exerted to the utmoſt. Scotch Highlanders, Iriſh
Papiſts, Hanoverians, Canadians, Indians, &amp;c. will all in various
ſhapes be employed. Parliament meets the firſt week in November.
I think his Catholic Majeſty may be ſatisfied with his Summer's
amuſement. The Spaniards fought with great bravery, and made a
fine retreat; but our Algerine friends ſurpaſſed them as much in
conduct as in number. Adieu.</p>

The Ducheſs has ſtopped Foote's piece. She ſent for him to
Kingſton-houſe, and threatened, bribed, argued, and wept for about
two hours. He aſſured her, that if the Chamberlain was obſtinate,
he ſhould publiſh it, with a dedication to her Grace.</p>

               <p>I SEND you two pieces of intelligence from the beſt authority, and
which, unleſs you hear them from ſome other quarter, I do not
wiſh you ſhould talk much about. 1ſt, When the Ruſſians arrive,
(if they refreſh themſelves in England or Ireland,) will you go and
ſee their camp? We have great hopes of getting a body of theſe
Barbarians. In conſequence of ſome very plain advances, King
George, with his own hand, wrote a very polite epiſtle to ſiſter
Kitty, requeſting her friendly aſſiſtance. Full powers and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were ſent at the ſame time to Gunning, to agree for any force
between five, and twenty thouſand men, <hi>carte blanche</hi> for the terms;
on condition, however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhould ſerve, not as auxiliaries,
but as mercenaries, and that the Ruſſian general ſhould be abſolutely
under the command of the Britiſh. They daily and hourly expect
a meſſenger, and hope to hear that the buſineſs is concluded. The
worſt of it is, that the Baltic will ſoon be frozen up, and that it muſt
be late next year before they can get to America. 2. In the mean
time we are not quite eaſy about Canada; and even if it ſhould be
ſafe from an attack, we cannot flatter ourſelves with the expectation
of bringing down that martial people on the Back Settlements. The
prieſts are ours; the gentlemen very prudently wait the event, and
are diſpoſed to join the ſtronger party; but the ſame lawleſs ſpirit
and impatience of government which have infected our Colonies, are
gone forth among the Canadian peaſants, over whom, ſince the
conqueſt, the nobleſſe have loſt much of their ancient influence.
Another thing which will pleaſe and ſurpriſe, is the aſſurance which
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0112200701:517"/>
I received from a man who might tell me a lie, but who could not
be miſtaken, that no arts, no management whatſoever, have been
uſed to procure the addreſſes which fill the Gazette, and that Lord
North was as much ſurpriſed at the firſt that came up, as we could
be at Sheffield. We ſhall have, I ſuppoſe, ſome briſk ſkirmiſhing
in parliament, but the buſineſs will ſoon be decided by our ſuperior
weight of fire. `<hi>A propos,</hi> I believe there has been ſome vague but
ſerious converſation about <hi>calling out the militia.</hi> The new levies go
on very ſlowly in Ireland. The Diſſenters, both there and here, are
violent and active. Adieu. I embrace my Lady and Maria.</p>

We proceed triumphantly with the Roman Empire, and ſhall certainly

of reſearch, without which no man deſerves the name of an Hiſtorian.
His narrative is perſpicuous and intereſting; his ſtyle is elegant and
forcible, though in ſome paſſages I think rather too laboured, and in
others too quaint. But theſe defects are amply compenſated by the
beauty of the general flow of language, and a very peculiar hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs

his quotations, (for experience has taught me to ſuſpect the accuracy
of my brother pen-men,) and I find he refers to no paſſage but what
he has ſeen with his own eyes. I hope the book will be as ſucceſsful

dated Edinburgh, <date>April 8th, 1776.</date>
               </head>
               <p>***** I AM very much taken with Mr. Gibbon's
Roman Hiſtory, which came from your
preſs, and am glad to hear of its ſucceſs. There will no books of
reputation now be printed in London but through your hands and Mr.
Cadell's. The Author tells me, that he is already preparing a ſecond
edition. I reſolved to have given him my advice with regard to the
manner of printing it; but as I am now writing to you, it is the
ſame thing. He ought certainly to print the number of the chapter
at the head of the margin; and it would be better if ſomething of
the contents could alſo be added. One is alſo plagued with his notes,
according to the preſent method of printing the book: when a note
is announced, you turn to the end of the volume; and there you
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:0112200701:522"/>
often find nothing but a reference to an authority. All theſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
ought only to be printed at the margin, or the bottom of the
page. I deſire a copy of my new edition ſhould be ſent to Mr.
Gibbon; as wiſhing that gentleman, whom I ſo highly value, ſhould
peruſe me in a form the leaſt imperfect to which I can bring my
work.</p>
               <p>***** Dr. Smith's performance is another excellent
work that has come from your preſs this winter; but I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to tell him, that it requires too much thought to be as popular
as Mr. Gibbon's.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I SHOULD make ſome apology for not writing you ſooner an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to your obliging letter: but if you ſhould honour me fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
with ſuch requeſts, you will find, that, with very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
I am a very dilatory and irregular correſpondent. I am
ſorry to tell you, that our reſpectable friend<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Hume.</note> is ſtill declining in his
health; he is greatly emaciated, and loſes ſtrength. He talks fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
of his near proſpect of dying. His mother, it ſeems, died
under the ſame ſymptoms; and it appears ſo little neceſſary, or
proper, to flatter him, that no one attempts it. I never obſerved
his underſtanding more clear, or his humour more pleaſant and
lively. He has a great averſion to leave the tranquillity of his own
houſe, to go in ſearch of health among inns and hoſtlers. And his
friends here gave way to him for ſome time; but now think it
neceſſary that he ſhould make an effort to try what change of place
and air, or any thing elſe Sir John Pringle may adviſe, can do for
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:0112200701:523"/>
him. I left him this morning in the mind to comply in this article,
and I hope that he will be prevailed on to ſet out in a few days. He
is juſt now ſixty-five.</p>
               <p>I am very glad that the pleaſure you give us recoils a little on
yourſelf, through our feeble teſtimony. I have, as you ſuppoſe,
been employed, at any intervals of leiſure or reſt I have had for
ſome years, in taking notes, or collecting materials, for a Hiſtory
of the diſtractions that broke down the Roman Republic, and
ended in the eſtabliſhment of Auguſtus and his immediate ſucceſſors.
The compliment you are pleaſed to pay, I cannot accept of, even to
my ſubject. Your ſubject now appears with advantages it was not
ſuppoſed to have had; and I ſuſpect that the magnificence of the
mouldering ruin will appear more ſtriking, than the ſame building
when the view is perplexed with ſcaffolding, workmen, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
lodgers, and the ear is ſtunned with the noiſe of deſtructions
and repairs, and the alarms of fire. The night which you begin
to deſcribe is ſolemn, and there are gleams of light ſuperior to what
is to be found in any other time. I comfort myſelf, that as my
trade is the ſtudy of human nature, I could not fix on a more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting
corner of it, than the end of the Roman Republic. Whether
my compilations ſhould ever deſerve the attention of any one beſides
myſelf, muſt remain to be determined after they are farther advanced.
I take the liberty to trouble you with the incloſed for Mr. Smith,
whoſe uncertain ſtay in London makes me at a loſs how to direct for
him. You have both ſuch reaſon to be pleaſed with the world juſt
now, that I hope you are pleaſed with each other.</p>

               <p>I AM angry that you ſhould impede my noble deſigns of viſiting
foreign parts, more eſpecially as I have an advantage which Sir
Wilful had not, that of underſtanding your foreign lingos. With
regard to Mrs. Gibbon, her intended viſit, to which I was not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
a ſtranger, will do me honour; and, though it ſhould delay
my emigration till the end of July, there will ſtill remain the months
of Auguſt, September, and October. Above all, abſtain from giving
the leaſt hint to any Bath correſpondent, and perhaps, if I am not
provoked by oppoſition, the thing may not be abſolutely certain.
At all events, you may depend on a previous viſit. At preſent, I
am very buſy with the Neckers. I live with her, juſt as I uſed to do
twenty years ago, laugh at her Paris varniſh, and oblige her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Engliſh huſbands' leſſons of proper and dutiful behaviour, is a ſenſible
good-natured creature. In about a fortnight I launch again into the
world in the ſhape of a quarto volume. Cadell aſſures me, that he
never remembered ſo eager and impatient a demand for a ſecond
edition. The town is beginning to break up; the day after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow

all is darkneſs, confuſion, and uncertainty, to ſuch a degree, that

Quebec, as well as the capture of Lee, reſts on the authority (a
very unexceptionable one) of the provincial papers, as they have
been tranſmitted by Governor Tryon from New York. Howe is
well, and eats plentifully; and the weather ſeems to clear up ſo faſt,
that, according to the Engliſh cuſtom, we have paſſed from the loweſt
deſpondency to a full aſſurance of ſucceſs. My new birth happened

               <p>YES, yes, I am alive, and well; but what ſhall I ſay? Town
grows empty, and this houſe, where I have paſſed very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
hours, is the only place which ſtill unites the flower of the
Engliſh youth. The ſtile of living, though <hi>ſomewhat</hi> expenſive, is
exceedingly pleaſant, and, notwithſtanding the rage of play, I have
found more entertaining, and even rational ſociety here, than in
any other club to which I belong. Mrs. Gibbon ſtill hangs in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe,
and ſeems to conſider a town-expedition with horror. I think,
however, that ſhe will be ſoon in motion; and when I have her in
Bentinck-ſtreet, we ſhall perhaps talk of a Sheffield excurſion. I am
now deeply engaged in the reign of Conſtantine, and, from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens
which I have already ſeen, I can venture to promiſe, that the
ſecond volume will not be leſs intereſting than the firſt. The fifteen
hundred copies are moving off with decent ſpeed, and the obliging
Cadell begins to mutter ſomething of a third edition for next year.
No news of Deyverdun, or his French tranſlation. What a lazy
dog! Madame Necker has been gone a great while. I gave her,
<hi>en partant,</hi> the moſt ſolemn aſſurances of following her <hi>paws</hi> in leſs

in the progreſs of **** towards light. We are in expectation
of American news. Carleton is made a Knight of the Bath. The

Theological Lectures; to wit, the Riſe and Progreſs of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy:

points in the Chriſtian antiquities. I ſuppoſe I need not now inform

By his own indolence, rather

frequently declared himſelf tired of life. No public news, nor any

A tough buſineſs indeed. You ſee by their declaration, that they

               <p>AS I preſume, my Lady does not make a practice of tumbling
down ſtairs every day after dinner, by this time the colours
muſt have faded, and the high places (I mean the temples) are
reduced to a proper level. But what, in the name of the great
prince, is the meaning of her declining the Urban expedition? Is it
the ſpontaneous reſult of her own proud ſpirit? or does it proceed
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:0112200701:534"/>
from the ſecret machinations of her domeſtic tyrant? At all events,

Things go on very proſperouſly in America. Howe is himſelf in
the Jerſeys, and will puſh at leaſt as far as the Delawar River. The
continental (perhaps <hi>now</hi> the rebel) army is in a great meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
and Waſhington, who wiſhes to cover Philadelphia, has not
more than ſix or ſeven thouſand men with him. Clinton deſigns to
conquer Rhode Iſland in his way home. But, what <hi>I</hi> think of much
greater confequence, a province made its ſubmiſſion, and deſired to
be reinſtated in the peace of the King. It is indeed only poor little
Georgia; and the application was made to Governor Tonyn of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida.
Some diſguſt at a violent ſtep of the Congreſs, who removed
the Preſident of their Provincial Aſſembly, a leading and popular
man, co-operated with the fear of the Indians, who began to amuſe

Town fills, and we are mighty agreeable. Laſt year, on the Queen's
birth-day, Sir G. Warren had his diamond ſtar cut off his coat; this

A ſhort excurſion which I have made to this place, during the
ſummer months, has occaſioned ſome delay in my receiving your
letter, and will prevent my poſſeſſing, till my return, the copy of
your Hiſtory, which you ſo politely deſired Mr. Strahan to ſend me.
But I have already gratified the eagerneſs of my impatience; and
although I was obliged to return the book much ſooner than I could
have wiſhed, I have ſeen enough to convince me, that the preſent
publication will ſupport, and, if poſſible, will extend the fame of
the Author; that the materials are collected with diligence, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged
with ſkill; that the firſt book contains a learned and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
account of the progreſs of diſcovery; that the achievements,
the dangers, and the crimes, of the Spaniſh adventures are related
with a temperate ſpirit; and that the moſt original, perhaps the
moſt curious, portion of the hiſtory of human manners is at length
reſcued from the hands of ſophiſts and declaimers. Lord Stormont,
and the few in this Capital, who have had an opportunity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing
the Hiſtory of America, unanimouſly concur in the ſame
ſentiments. Your work is already become a favourite topic of public
converſation; and Mr. Suard is repeatedly preſſed, in my hearing,
to fix the time when his tranſlation will appear.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf you will not abandon your deſign of viſiting Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
next winter; as I already anticipate, in my own mind, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which I ſhall derive from ſo pleaſing and ſo honourable a
connection. In the mean while, I ſhould eſteem myſelf happy, if
you could think of any literary commiſſion, in the execution of
which I might be uſeful to you at Paris, where I propoſe to ſtay till
very near the meeting of Parliament. Let me, for inſtance, ſuggeſt
an enquiry, which cannot be indifferent to you, and which might
perhaps be within my reach. A few days ago I dined with Bagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſky,
the famous adventurer, who eſcaped from his exile at Kam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchatſka,
and returned into Europe by Japan and China. His nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:0112200701:542"/>
was amuſing, though I know not how far his veracity, in point
of circumſtances, may ſafely be truſted. It was his original deſign
to penetrate through the North Eaſt Paſſage; and he actually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the coaſt of Aſia as high as the latitude of 67° 35′, till his
progreſs was ſtopped by the ice, in a Streight between the two
Continents, which was only ſeven leagues broad. Thence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
along the coaſt of America, as low as Cape Mendocin; but
was repulſed by contrary winds, in his attempts to reach the port of
Acapulco. The Journal of his Voyage, with his original Charts, is
now at Verſailles, in the <hi>Depót des Affaires Etrangers;</hi> and if you
conceived that it would be of any uſe to you for a ſecond edition, I
would try what might be obtained; though I am not ignorant of
that mean jealouſy which you yourſelf have experienced, and ſo
deſervedly ſtigmatiſed. I am, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I HAD the honour of your obliging Letter, and I ſhould be a very
proud man indeed, if I were not vain of the approbation which
you are pleaſed to beſtow upon me. As you will now have had an
opportunity to peruſe the book, which you had only ſeen when you
wrote to me, I indulge myſelf in the hopes, that the favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
you had formed of it, is not diminiſhed. I am much pleaſed
with your mentioning my friendſhip with Mr. Hume; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
conſidered that as one of the moſt fortunate and honourable
circumſtances of my life. It is a felicity of the age and country in
which we live, that men of letters can enter the ſame walk of ſcience,
and go on ſucceſsfully, without feeling one ſentiment of envy or
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:0112200701:543"/>
rivalſhip. In the intercourſe between Mr. Hume and me, we always
found <hi>ſomething to blame,</hi> as well as <hi>ſomething to commend.</hi> I have
received frequently very valuable criticiſms on my performances
from him; and I have ſometimes ventured to offer him my ſtrictures
on his works. Permit me to hope for the ſame indulgence from
you. If, in reading the Hiſtory of America, any thing, either in
the matter or ſtyle, has occurred to you as reprehenſible, I will deem
it a moſt obliging favour if you will communicate it freely to me.
I am certain of profiting by ſuch a communication.</p>
               <p>I return you thanks for your frank offer of executing any literary
commiſſion for me. I accept of it without ceremony, and am flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with the idea of receiving ſuch aid from your hands. I know
nothing of Bagniouſki's Adventures, but what was publiſhed in ſome
Newſpaper. If one can rely on his veracity, what he relates muſt
be very intereſting to me. If you had been writing the Hiſtory of
America, the queſtion concerning the mode of peopling it, might
not perhaps have occupied your attention very much. But it was
proper for me to conſider it more fully. Bagniouſki (if he may be
credited) has ſeen what it may be uſeful for me to know. I can ſee
no reaſon why the Court of France ſhould be ſhy about communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
his Journal, and the Charts which illuſtrate it; poſſibly my
name may operate ſomewhat towards obtaining a copy of both;
your interpoſition, I am confident, will do a great deal. It will be
very illiberal indeed, if ſuch a communication were refuſed. My Lord
Stormont (by whoſe attention I have been much honoured) would
not decline to give his aid, were that neceſſary. But if your Court
reſembles that of Spain, I am afraid every propoſal from an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
is received with ſome degree of jealouſy. Your own private
application will, I apprehend, be more effectual. As it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that a ſecond edition may go to preſs early in the winter, it
will add to the favour, if you can ſoon inform me concerning the
ſucceſs of your negociation. As this is ſomething in the ſtyle of

               <p>I TOLD you what would infallibly happen, and you know enough
of the nature of the beaſt not to be ſurpriſed at it. I have now
been at Paris exactly five weeks; during which time I have not
written to any perſon whatſoever within the Britiſh dominions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
two lines of notification to Mrs. Gibbon. The daemon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination
has at length yielded to the genius of friendſhip, aſſiſted
indeed by the powers of fear and ſhame. But when I have ſeated
myſelf before a table, and begin to revolve all that I have ſeen
and taſted during this buſy period, I feel myſelf oppreſſed and
confounded; and I am very near throwing away the pen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
myſelf to indolent deſpair. A complete hiſtory would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a volume, at leaſt, as corpulent as the Decline and Fall; and if
I attempt to ſelect and abridge, beſides the difficulty of the choice,
there occur ſo many things which cannot properly be entruſted to
paper, and ſo many others of too ſlight a texture to ſupport the
journey, that I am almoſt tempted to reſerve for our future conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
the detail of my pleaſures and occupations. But as I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that you are <hi>rigid</hi> and impatient, I will try to convey, in a few
words, a general idea of my ſituation as a man of the world, and as
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:0112200701:545"/>
a man of letters. You remember that the Neckers were my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
dependance; and the reception which I have met with from them
very far ſurpaſſed my moſt ſanguine expectations. I do not indeed
lodge in their houſe, (as it might incite the jealouſy of the huſband,
and procure me a lettre de cachet,) but I live very much with them,
and dine and ſup whenever they have company, which is almoſt
every day, and whenever I like it, for they are not in the leaſt <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans.</hi>
Mr. Walpole gave me an introduction to Madame du Def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fand,
an agreeable young lady of eighty-two years of age, who has
conſtant ſuppers, and the beſt company in Paris. When you ſee the
Duke of Richmond, he will give you an account of that houſe, where
I meet him almoſt every evening. Aſk him about Madame de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.
I have met the Duke of Choiſeul at his particular requeſt,
dined by <hi>accident</hi> with Franklin, converſed with the Emperor, been
preſented at court, and gradually, or rather rapidly, I find my
acquaintance ſpreading over the moſt valuable parts of Paris. They
pretend to like me, and whatever you may think of French profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
I am convinced that ſome at leaſt are ſincere. On the other
hand, I feel myſelf eaſy and happy in their company, and only regret
that I did not come over two or three months ſooner. Though Paris
throughout the ſummer promiſes me a very agreeable ſociety, yet I
am hurt every day by the departure of men and women whom I begin
to know with ſome familiarity, the departure of officers for their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
and garriſons, of biſhops for their dioceſes, and even of
country gentlemen for their eſtates, as a rural taſte gains ground in
this country. So much for the general idea of my acquaintance;
details would be endleſs, yet unſatisfactory. You may add, to the
pleaſures of ſociety thoſe of the ſpectacles and promenades, and you
will find that I lead a very agreeable life; let me juſt condeſcend to
obſerve, that it is not extravagant. After decking myſelf out with
ſilks and ſilver, the ordinary eſtabliſhment of coach, lodging, ſervants,
eating, and pocket expences, does not exceed ſixty pounds <hi>per</hi>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:0112200701:546"/>
month. Yet I have two footmen in handſome liveries behind my
coach, and my apartment is hung with damaſk. Adieu for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
I have more to ſay, but were I to attempt any farther progreſs,
you muſt wait another poſt; and you have already waited long
enough, of all conſcience.</p>
               <p>Let me juſt in two words give you an idea of my day. I am now
going (nine o'clock) to the King's library, where I ſhall ſtay till twelve;
as ſoon as I am dreſſed, I ſet out to dine with the Duke de Nivernois;
ſhall go from thence to the French comedy, into the Princeſs de
Beauveau's loge grillée, and cannot quite determine whether I ſhall
ſup at Madame du Deffand's, Madame Necker's, or the Sardinian
Ambaſſadreſs's. Once more adieu.</p>
               <p>I embrace my Lady and <hi>Bambini.</hi> I ſhall with cheerfulneſs exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
any of her commiſſions.</p>

               <p>WELL, and who is the culprit now?—Thus far had I written in
the pride of my heart, and fully determined to inflict an epiſtle
upon you, even before I received any anſwer to my former; I was
very near a bull. But this forward half line lay ten days barren and
inactive, till its generative powers were excited by the miſſive which
I received yeſterday. What a wretched piece of work do we ſeem to
be making of it in America? The greateſt force which any European
power ever ventured to tranſport into that continent, is not ſtrong
enough even to attack the enemy; the naval ſtrength of Great Britain
is not ſufficient to prevent the Americans (they have almoſt loſt the
appellation of Rebels) from receiving every aſſiſtance that they
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:0112200701:547"/>
wanted; and in the mean time you are obliged to call out the militia
to defend your own coaſts againſt their privateers. You poſſibly may
expect from me ſome account of the deſigns and policy of the French
court, but I chooſe to decline that taſk for two reaſons: 1ſt, Becauſe
you may find them laid open in every newſpaper; and 2dly, Becauſe
I live too much with their courtiers and miniſters to know any thing
about them. I ſhall only ſay, that I am not under any immediate
apprehenſions of a war with France. It is much more pleaſant as
well as profitable to view in ſafety the raging of the tempeſt, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
to pick up ſome pieces of the wreck, and to improve their
trade, their agriculture, and their finances, while the two countries
are <hi>lento colliſa duello.</hi> Far from taking any ſtep to put a ſpeedy end
to this aſtoniſhing diſpute, I ſhould not be ſurpriſed if next ſummer
they were to lend their cordial aſſiſtance to England, as to the weaker
party. As to my perſonal engagement with the D. of R. I recollect
a few ſlight ſkirmiſhes, but nothing that deſerves the name of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
engagement. The extravagance of ſome diſputants, both
French and Engliſh, who have eſpouſed the cauſe of America, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
inſpires me with an extraordinary vigour. Upon the whole, I
find it much eaſier to defend the juſtice than the policy of our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
but there are certain caſes, where whatever is repugnant to
ſound policy ceaſes to be juſt.</p>
               <p>The more I ſee of Paris, the more I like it. The regular courſe
of the ſociety in which I live is eaſy, polite, and entertaining;
and almoſt every day is marked by the acquiſition of ſome new
acquaintance, who is worth cultivating, or who, at leaſt, is worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering.
To the great admiration of the French, I regularly
dine and regularly ſup, drink a diſh of ſtrong coffee after each meal,
and find my ſtomach a citizen of the world. The ſpectacles, (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the Italian, and above all the French Comedies,) which are
open the whole ſummer, afford me an agreeable relaxation from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and to ſhew you that I frequent them from taſte, and not from
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:0112200701:548"/>
idleneſs, I have not yet ſeen the Coliſee, the Vauxhall, the Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vards,
or any of thoſe places of entertainment which conſtitute Paris
to moſt of our countrymen. Occaſional trips to dine or ſup in ſome
of the thouſand country-houſes which are ſcattered round the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
of Paris, ſerve to vary the ſcene. In the mean while the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
inſenſibly glides away, and the fatal month of October approaches,
when I muſt change the houſe of Madame Necker for the Houſe of
Commons. I regret that I could not chooſe the winter, inſtead of the
ſummer, for this excurſion: I ſhould have found many valuable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſhould have preſerved others whom I have loſt as I began
to know them. The Duke de Choiſeul, who deſerves attention both
for himſelf, and for keeping the beſt houſe in Paris, paſſes ſeven
months of the year in Touraine; and though I have been tempted, I
conſider with horror a journey of ſixty leagues into the country.
The Princeſs of Beauveau, who is a moſt ſuperior woman, has been
abſent above ſix weeks, and does not return till the 24th of this
month. A large body of recruits will be aſſembled by the Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau
journey; but in order to have a thorough knowledge of this
ſplendid country, I ought to ſtay till the month of January; and if
I could be ſure that Oppoſition would be as tranquil as they were laſt
year—I think your life has been as animated, or, at leaſt, as tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and I envy you Lady Payne, &amp;c. much more than either the
Primate, or the Chief-juſtice. Let not the generous breaſt of my Lady
be torn by the black ſerpents of envy. She ſtill poſſeſſes the firſt place
in the ſentiments of her ſlave: but the adventure of the fan was a
mere accident, owing to Lord Carmarthen. Adieu. I think you
may be ſatisfied. I ſay nothing of my terreſtrial affairs.</p>

               <p>YOU do not readily believe in praeternatural miſcarriages of letters;
nor I neither. Liſten, however, to a plain and honeſt narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
This morning after breakfaſt, as I was ruminating on <hi>your</hi>
ſilence, Thomas, my new footman, with confuſion in his looks and
ſtammering on his tongue, produced a letter reaſonably ſoiled, which
he was to have brought me the day of his arrival, and which had
lain forgotten from that time in his pocket. To ſhorten as much
as poſſible the continuance, I immediately enquired, whether any
method of conveyance could be deviſed more expeditious than the
poſt, and was fortunately informed of your coachman's intentions.
You probably know the heads of the plan; an Act of Parliament to
declare, that we never <hi>had</hi> any intention of taxing America: another
Act, to empower the Crown to name Commiſſioners, authoriſed to
ſuſpend hoſtilities by ſea and land, as well as all obnoxious Acts;
and, in ſhort, to grant every thing, except independence. Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
after expreſſing their doubts whether the lance of Achilles
could cure the wound which it had inflicted, could not refuſe their
aſſent to the principles of conduct which they themſelves had always
recommended. Yet you muſt acknowledge, that in a buſineſs of
this magnitude there may ariſe ſeveral important queſtions, which,
without a ſpirit of faction, will deſerve to be debated: whether Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ought not to name the Commiſſioners? whether it would
not be better to repeal the obnoxious Acts ourſelves? I do not find
that the world; that is, a few people whom I happen to converſe
with; are much inclined to praiſe Lord N.'s ductility of temper.
In the ſervice of next Friday you will, however, take notice of the
injunction given by the Liturgy: <q>And all the People ſhall ſay
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:0112200701:553"/>
after the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> Turn us again, O Lord, and ſo ſhall we be
turned.</q> While we conſider whether we ſhall negociate, I fear
the French have been more diligent. It is poſitively aſſerted, both
in private and in Parliament, and not contradicted by the Miniſters,
that on the fifth of this month a Treaty of Commerce (which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
leads to a war) was ſigned at Paris with the independent
States of America. Yet there ſtill remains a hope that England may
obtain the preference. The two greateſt countries in Europe are
fairly running a race for the favour of America.</p>

conjecture, lamentation, declamation, &amp;c. which would fill pages,

of intelligence, for which I may be able to afford moments and lines.
Hear then—The French Ambaſſador went off yeſterday morning,
not without ſome ſlight expreſſions of ill-humour from John Bull.
Lord Stormont is probably arrived to-day. No <hi>immediate</hi> declaration,
except on our ſide. A report (but vague) of an action in the Bay,
between La Motte Piquet and Digby; the former has five ſhips
and three frigates, with three large ſtore-ſhips under convoy; the
latter has eleven ſhips of the line. If the Frenchman ſhould ſail to
the mouth of the Delawar, he may poſſibly be followed and ſhut
up. When Franklin was received at Verſailles, Deane went in the
ſame character to Vienna, and Arthur Lee to Madrid. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the reports of an action in Sileſia, they ſubſide; and I have
ſeen a letter from Eliot at Berlin of the tenth inſtant, without any
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:0112200701:554"/>
mention of actual hoſtilities, and even ſpeaking of the impending
war as not abſolutely inevitable. Laſt Tueſday the firſt payment
of the loan of ſix hundred thouſand pounds was certainly made;
and as it would otherwiſe be forfeited, it is a ſecurity for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.

will be more and longer at Sheffield-Place than you imagine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

want to ſee you; my martial ardour makes me look to Coxheath,
neceſſity obliges me to think of Beriton, and I feel ſomething of a
very new inclination to taſte the ſweets of the country. Aunt Kitty
ſhares the ſame ſentiments; but various obſtacles will not allow us
to be with you before Saturday, or perhaps Sunday evening; I ſay
<hi>evening,</hi> as we mean to take the cool part of the day, and ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably

againſt him. He is ordered out again with three or four large
ſhips; two of ninety, two of ſeventy-four, and the fiftieth regiment,
as marines. In the mean time the French, with a ſuperior fleet,
are maſters of the ſea; and our outward-bound Eaſt and Weſt
India trade is in the moſt imminent danger.</p>

               <p>I DELAYED writing, not ſo much through indolence, as becauſe I
expected every poſt to hear from you. The ſtate of Beriton is
uncertain, incomprehenſible, tremendous. It would be endleſs to
ſend you the folios of Hugonin, but I have incloſed you one of his
moſt pictureſque epiſtles, on which you may meditate. Few offers;
one, promiſing enough, came from a gentleman at Camberwell. I
detected him, with maſterly ſkill and diligence, to be only an attorney's
Clerk, without money, credit, or experience. I have written as yet
in vain to Sir John Shelley, about Hearſay; perhaps you might get
intelligence. I much fear that the Beriton expedition is neceſſary;
but it has occurred to me, that if I <hi>met,</hi> inſtead of <hi>accompanying</hi> you,
it would ſave me a journey of above one hundred miles. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
led to another of a very impudent nature; <hi>viz.</hi> that if I

an effort of friendſhip worthy of Theſeus or Perithous: modern

times would hardly credit, much leſs imitate, ſuch exalted virtue.
No news from America; yet there are people, large ones too, who
talk of conquering it next ſummer with the help of twenty thouſand
Ruſſians. I fancy you are better ſatisfied with private than public
war. The Liſbon packet in coming home met above forty of our

you took the trouble of ſending to me. I hope you are not one
of thoſe who eſtimate kindneſs by punctuality in correſpondence. I
read your little performance with much eagerneſs, and ſome ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
The latter ſoon ceaſed. The tone you take with your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in this <hi>impar congreſſus</hi> appears to me perfectly proper; and,
though I watched you with ſome attention, I have not obſerved any
expreſſion which I ſhould, on your own account, wiſh to be altered.
Davis's book never reached us here. Our diſtance from the Capital
operates ſomewhat like time. Nothing but what has intrinſic value
comes down to us. We hear ſometimes of the worthleſs and vile
things that float for a day on the ſtream, but we ſeldom ſee them.
I am ſatisfied, however, that it was neceſſary for you to animadvert
on a man who had brought accuſations againſt you, which no
gentleman can allow to be made without notice. I am perſuaded,
that the perſons who inſtigated the man to ſuch an illiberal attack,
will now be aſhamed of him. At the ſame time I applaud your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
of not degrading yourſelf, by a ſecond conflict, with ſuch
antagoniſts.</p>
               <p>I am aſhamed to tell you, how little I have done ſince I had the
pleaſure of ſeeing you. I have been prevented, partly by ill health,
partly by cauſes which I ſhall explain when we meet: I hope that

interrupted by the Colonel of Dragoons<note n="†" place="bottom">Colonel Holroyd at that time was raiſing a regiment of Light Dragoons.</note> with a train of ſerjeants,
trumpets, recruits, &amp;c. &amp;c. My own time is much and agreeably
employed in the proſecution of my buſineſs. After doing much
more than I expected to have done within the time, I find myſelf
much leſs advanced than I expected: yet I begin to reckon, and as

which ſo many friends or enemies choſe to lay at my door, I am
perfectly innocent, even of the knowledge of that production; and

               <p>WHEN the Attorney General informed me of the expreſs he had
juſt ſent down to Coventry, I had not the leaſt doubt of your
embracing the bolder reſolution. You are indeed obliged to him for
his real friendſhip, which he feels and expreſſes warmly; on this
occaſion I hope it will be ſucceſsful, and that in a few days you will
find yourſelf among us at St. Stephen's in the heat of the battle. But
you know that I am a daſtardly, puſillanimous ſpirit, more inclined
to fear than to hope, and not very eager in the purſuit of <hi>expenſive</hi>
vanity. On this vacancy the celerity of your motions may probably
prevent oppoſition; but at the general election your enemy the
corporation will not be aſleep, and I wiſh, if it be not too late, to
warn you againſt any promiſes or engagements which may terminate
in a defeat, or at leaſt a conteſt of ten thouſand pounds. Adieu.
I could believe (without ſeeing it under her paw) that my Lady
wiſhes to leave Coventry. No news! foreign or domeſtic. I did
not forget to mention the <hi>companies,</hi> but find people, as I expected,

have ſhewn ſome ſigns of life by the next poſt. But ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
are all human affairs, that I found myſelf arreſted by a mighty

part on which he choſe to exerciſe his cruelty, he left me neither
ſtrength nor ſpirits to uſe my hand in relating the melancholy tale.
At preſent, I have the pleaſure of informing you, that the fever and
inflammation have ſubſided: but the abſolute weakneſs and monſtrous
ſwelling of my two feet confine me to my chair and flannels; and
this confinement moſt unluckily happens at a very <hi>nice</hi> and important

               <p>AS a Member of Parliament, I cannot be expoſed to any danger,
ſince the Houſe of Commons has adjourned to Monday
ſe'nnight; as an individual, I do not conceive myſelf to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.
I am not apt, without duty or neceſſity, to thruſt myſelf
into a mob: and our part of the town is as quiet as a country village.
So much for perſonal ſafety; but I cannot give the ſame aſſurances
of public tranquillity: forty thouſand Puritans, ſuch as they might
be in the time of Cromwell, have ſtarted out of their graves; the
tumult has been dreadful; and even the remedy of military force
and martial law is unpleaſant. But Government, with fifteen thouſand
regulars in town, and every gentleman (but one) on their ſide, muſt
extinguiſh the flame. The execution of laſt night was ſevere; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it muſt be repeated to-night: yet, upon the whole, the tumult
ſubſides. Colonel Holroyd was all laſt night in Holborn among the
flames, with the Northumberland Militia, and performed very bold
and able ſervice. I will write again in a poſt or two.</p>

The meaſures of Government have been ſeaſonable and
vigorous; and even oppoſition has been forced to confeſs, that the
military power was applied and regulated with the utmoſt propriety.
Our danger is at an end, but our diſgrace will be laſting, and the
month of June 1780, will ever be marked by a dark and diabolical
fanaticiſm, which I had ſuppoſed to be extinct, but which actually
ſubſiſts in Great Britain, perhaps beyond any other country in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
Our parliamentary work draws to a concluſion; and I am

correcting for the preſs, the continuation of my Hiſtory, two volumes

to Bentinck-ſtreet more cloſely than any other part of my literary

               <p>I AM aſhamed of having deferred ſo long to thank you for the
agreeable preſents of your two new volumes; but juſt as I had
finiſhed the firſt reading of them, I was taken ill, and continued, for
two or three weeks, nervous, deaf, and languid. I have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:0112200701:572"/>
covered as much ſpirit as to tell you, with what perfect ſatisfaction I
have not only peruſed, but ſtudied, this part of your work. I knew
enough of your talents and induſtry to expect a great deal, but you
have gone far beyond my expectations. I can recollect no hiſtorical
work from which I ever received ſo much inſtruction; and, when I
conſider in what a barren field you had to glean and pick up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
I am truly aſtoniſhed at the connected and intereſting ſtory
you have formed. I like the ſtyle of theſe volumes better than that
of the firſt; there is the ſame beauty, richneſs, and perſpicuity of
language, with leſs of that quaintneſs, into which your admiration of
Tacitus ſometimes ſeduced you. I am highly pleaſed with the reign of
Julian. I was a little afraid that <hi>you</hi> might lean with ſome partiality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; but even bigots, I ſhould think, muſt allow, that you have
delineated his moſt ſingular character with a more maſterly hand than
ever touched it before. You ſet me a reading his works, with which
I was very ſlenderly acquainted; and I am much ſtruck with the
felicity wherewith you have deſcribed that odd infuſion of Heathen
fanaticiſm and philoſophical coxcombry, which mingled with the
great qualities of a hero, and a genius. Your chapter concerning
the paſtoral nations is admirable; and, though I hold myſelf to
be a tolerably good general hiſtorian, a great part of it was new to
me. As ſoon as I have leiſure, I purpoſe to trace you to your ſources
of information; and I have no doubt of finding you as exact there,
as I have found you in other paſſages where I have made a ſcrutiny.
It was always my idea that an hiſtorian ſhould feel himſelf a witneſs
giving evidence upon oath. I am glad to perceive by your minute
ſcrupuloſity, that your notions are the ſame. The laſt chapter in
your work is the only one with which I am not entirely ſatisfied.
I imagine you rather anticipate, in deſcribing the juriſprudence and
inſtitutions of the Franks; and ſhould think that the account of
private war, ordeals, chivalry, &amp;c. would have come in more in its
place about the age of Charlemagne, or later: but with reſpect
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:0112200701:573"/>
to this, and ſome other petty criticiſms, I will have an opportunity
of talking fully to you ſoon, as I propoſe ſetting our for London on
Monday. I have, indeed, many things to ſay to you; and, as my
ſtay in London is to be very ſhort, I ſhall hope to find your door
(at which I will be very often) always open to me. I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:0112200701:575"/>
probably travel, for ſpeed, through part of Egypt and Arabia, and
ſhould be able, in my way, to procure many Eaſtern tracts of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
and juriſprudence. I might become a good <hi>Mahomedan</hi>
lawyer before I reached Calcutta, and, in my vacations, ſhould find
leiſure to explain, in my native language, whatever the Arabs,
Perſians, and Turks, have written on ſcience, hiſtory, and the ſine
arts.</p>
               <p>My happineſs by no means depends on obtaining this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I am in eaſy circumſtances without my profeſſion, and
have flattering proſpects in it; but if the preſent ſummer and the
enſuing antumn elapſe without my receiving any anſwer, favourable
or unfavourable, I ſhall be forced to conſider that ſilence as a polite
refuſal, and, having given ſincere thanks for paſt favours, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
drop all thoughts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <q>deep as ever plummet
ſounded, ſhall drown my <hi>Perſian</hi> books.</q> If my politics have
given offence, it would be manly in Miniſters to tell me ſo. I ſhall
never be <hi>perſonally</hi> hoſtile to them, nor enliſt under partly banners
of any colour; but I will never reſign my opinions for <hi>intereſt,</hi> though
I would cheerfully abandon them on <hi>conviction.</hi> My reaſon, ſuch
as it is, can only be controlled by better reaſon, to which I am ever
open. As to my freedom of thought, ſpeech, and action, I ſhall
ever ſay what Charles XII. wrote under the map of Riga, <q>
                     <hi>Dieu me
l'a donnee; le diable ne me l' otera pas.</hi>
                  </q> But the fair anſwer to this
objection is, that my ſyſtem is purely ſpeculative, and has no relation
to my ſeat on the bench in India, where I ſhould hardly think of
inſtructing the Gentoos in the maxims of the Athenians. I believe
I ſhould not have troubled you with this letter, if I did not fear
that your attendance in Parliament might deprive me of the pleaſure
of meeting you at the Club next Tueſday; and I ſhall go to Oxford
a few days after. At all times, and in all places, I ſhall ever be,
with undiſſembled regard, dear Sir, your much obliged and faithful

               <p>SOON after my return I had a long converſation with our friend
Mr. Smith, in which I ſtated to him every particular you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to me, with reſpect to the propriety of going on with your
great work. I was happy to find, that his opinion coincided per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
with that which I had ventured to give you. His deciſions,
you know, are both prompt and vigorous; and he would not allow
that you ought to heſitate a moment in your choice. He promiſed
to write his ſentiments to you very fully. But as he may have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
to do this, for it is not willingly that he puts pen to paper,
I thought it might be agreeable to you to know his opinion, though I
imagine you could hardly entertain any doubt concerning it. I hope
you have brought ſuch a ſtock of health and ſpirits from Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmſtone,
that you are ſet ſeriouſly at your deſk, and that in two
winters or ſo, you will diſplay the creſcent of Mahomet on the
dome of St. Sophia. I met t'other day, in a work addreſſed to
yourſelf, a ſenſible paſſage from F. Paul, which perfectly removes
one of your chief difficulties, as to the barrenneſs of ſome parts of
your period. Hayley's Eſſay on Hiſtory, p. 133. By the bye,
who is this Mr. Hayley? His poetry has more merit than that of
moſt of his contemporaries; but his whiggiſm is ſo bigotted, and
his Chriſtianity ſo ſierce, that he almoſt diſguſts one with two very
good things.</p>
               <p>I have got quite well long ago, and am perfectly free from deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

               </opener>
               <p>I RETURNED to this place with Lord and Lady Sheffield, with the
deſign of paſſing two or three weeks in a ſituation which had
ſo highly delighted me. But how vain are all ſublunary hopes! I
had forgot that there is ſome difference between the ſunſhine of
Auguſt and the cold fogs (though we have uncommon good weather)
of November. Inſtead of my beautiful ſea-ſhore, I am confined to
a dark lodging in the middle of the town; for the place is ſtill full,
and our time is now ſpent in the dull imitation of a London life.
To complete my misfortunes, Lord Sheffield was haſtily ordered to
Canterbury and Deal, to ſuppreſs ſome diſturbances, and I was left
almoſt alone with my Lady, in the ſervile ſtate of a married man.
But he returns to-day, and I hope to be ſeated in my own library
by the middle of next week. However, you will not be ſorry to
hear that I have refreſhed myſelf by a very <hi>idle</hi> ſummer, and indeed
a much idler and more pleaſant winter than the Houſe of Commons
will ever allow me to enjoy again. I had almoſt forgot Mr. Hayley;
ungratefully enough, ſince I really paſſed a very ſimple, but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
day with him. His place, though ſmall, is elegant as his
mind, which I value much more highly. Mrs. ** wrote a
melancholy ſtory of an American mother, a friend of her friend,
who in a ſhort time had loſt three ſons; one killed by the ſavages,
one run mad from the fright at that accident, and the third taken at
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:0112200701:579"/>
ſea, now in England, a priſoner in Forton hoſpital. For <hi>him</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might perhaps be done. Your humanity will prompt you to
obtain from Mrs. ** a more accurate account of names,
dates, and circumſtances; but you will prudently ſuppreſs my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
leſt I ſhould raiſe hopes which it may not be in my power
to gratify. Lady S. begs to ſend her kindeſt compliments to you.</p>

my Midſummer letter. Whatever may happen, you may reſt
fully ſecure, that the materials of it ſhall always be <hi>found.</hi> But on
this occaſion I have miſſed four or five poſts; poſtponing, as uſual,
from morning to the evening bell, which now rings, till it has occurred
to me, that it might not be amiſs to encloſe the two eſſential lines, if
I only added that the influenza has been known to me only by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of others. Lord Rockingham is at laſt dead; a good man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he might be a miniſter: his ſucceſſor is not yet named, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the Cabinet are ſuſpected. If Lord Shelburne ſhould be the
man, as I think he will, the friends of his predeceſſor will quarrel
with him before Chriſtmas. At all events, I foreſee much tumult
and ſtrong oppoſition, from which I ſhould be very glad to extricate
myſelf, by quitting the Houſe of Commons with honour. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you may hear, I believe there is not the leaſt intention of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
Parliament, which would indeed be a raſh and dangerous
meaſure. I hope you like Mr. Hayley's poem; he riſes with his
ſubject, and ſince Pope's death, I am ſatisfied that England has not

ſeen ſo happy a mixture of ſtrong ſenſe and flowing numbers. Are
you not delighted with his addreſs to his mother? I underſtand
that ſhe was in plain proſe every thing that he ſpeaks her in verſe.
This ſummer I ſhall ſtay in town, and work at my trade, till I make
ſome holidays for my Bath excurſion. Lady Sheffield is at Brighton,
and he is under tents, like the wild Arabs; ſo that my country
houſe is ſhut up. I am, dear Madam, ever yours.</p>

               <p>I SHOULD like to hear ſometimes, whether you ſurvive the ſcenes
of action and danger in which a dragoon is continually involved.
What a difference between the life of a dragoon and that of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher!
and I will freely own that I (the philoſopher) am much better
ſatisfied with my own independent and tranquil ſituation, in which
I have always ſomething to do, without ever being obliged to do
any thing. The Hampton Court villa has anſwered my expectation,
and proved no ſmall addition to my comforts; ſo that I am reſolved
next ſummer to hire, borrow, or ſteal, either the ſame, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the ſame kind. Every morning I walk a mile or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
breakfaſt, read and write <hi>quantum ſufficit,</hi> mount my chaiſe
and viſit in the neighbourhood, accept ſome invitations, and eſcape
others, uſe the Lucans as my daily bread, dine pleaſantly at home,
or ſociably abroad, reſerve for ſtudy an hour or two in the evening,
lie in town regularly once a week, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to Mrs. G. my new arrangements; the certainty that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober
will be fine, and my increaſing doubts whether I ſhall be
able to reach Bath before Chriſtmas. Do you intend (but how can
you intend any thing?) to paſs the winter under canvaſs. Perhaps
under the veil of Hampton Court I may lurk ten days or a fortnight
at Sheffield, if the enraged Lady does not ſhut the doors againſt me.
The Warden<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord North.</note> paſſed through in his way to Dover. He is not ſo
fat, and more cheerful than ever. I had not any private converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:0112200701:582"/>
with him; but he clearly holds the balance, unleſs he lets it
drop out of his hand. The Pandaemonium (as I underſtand) does
not meet till the twenty-ſixth of November. Town is more a deſert
than I ever knew it. I arrived yeſterday, dined at Sir Joſhua's with

A certain late Secretary of Ireland reckons the Houſe of Commons

I am not in ſuch a fury with the letter of American independence;
but I think it ſeems ill-timed and uſeleſs; and I am much enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with the metaphyſical diſputes between Government and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſin

ſome time in town in mutual ignorance. Unluckly enough;

is worthy of an Iriſh Baron: you thought Sarah might be at Bath,
becauſe you directed letters to her at Clifton near Briſtol; where
indeed I ſaw her in a delightful ſituation, ſwept by the winter winds,
and ſcorched by the ſummer ſun. A nobler reaſon for your ſilence
would be the care of the public papers, to record your ſteps, words,

               <p>For my own part, my late journey has only confirmed me in the

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>

                     <p>AS a mark of your eſteem, I ſhould have accepted with pleaſure
your Hiſtory of the Corruptions of Chriſtianity. You have been
careful to inform me, that it is intended, not as a gift, but as a
challenge, and ſuch a challenge you muſt permit me to decline. At
the ſame time you glory in outſtripping the zeal of the Mufti and
the Lama, it may be proper to declare, that I ſhould equally refuſe
the defiance of thoſe venerable divines. Once, and once only, the
juſt defence of my own veracity provoked me to deſcend into the
amphitheatre; but as long as you attack opinions which I have never
maintained, or maintain principles which I have never denied, you
may ſafely exult in my ſilence and your own victory. The
difference between us, (on the credibility of miracles,) which you
chuſe to ſuppoſe, and wiſh to argue, is a trite and antient topic
of controverſy, and, from the opinion which you entertain of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and of me, it does not appear probable that our diſpute would
either edify or enlighten the Public.</p>
                     <p>That Public will decide to whom the <hi>invidious</hi> name of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
more juſtly belongs; to the Hiſtorian, who, without interpoſing
his own ſentiments, has delivered a ſimple narrative of authentic
facts, or to the diſputant who proudly rejects all natural proofs
of the immortality of the ſoul, overthrows (by circumſcribing)
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:0112200701:586"/>
the inſpiration of the evangeliſts and apoſtles, and condemns the
religion of every Chriſtian nation, as a fable leſs innocent, but not
leſs abſurd, than Mahomet's journey to the third Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And now, Sir, ſince you aſſume a right to determine the objects
of my paſt and future ſtudies, give me leave to convey to your ear
the almoſt unanimous, and not offenſive wiſh, of the philoſophic
world:—that you would confine your talents and induſtry to thoſe
ſciences in which real and uſeful improvements <hi>can</hi> be made. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the end of your predeceſſor Servetus, not of his life, (the
Calvins of our days are reſtrained from the uſe of the ſame fiery
arguments,) but, I mean, the end of his reputation. His theological
writings are loſt in oblivion; and if his book on the Trinity be ſtill
preſerved, it is only becauſe it contains the firſt rudiments of the
diſcovery of the circulation of the blood.</p>

               <p>IT would have been impertinent in me, eſpecially conſidering the
object of my <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> to have ſent you a copy of it as a mark of
my <hi>eſteem</hi> or <hi>friendſhip.</hi> What I meant was to act the part of a fair
and open <hi>adverſary,</hi> and I am truly ſorry that you decline the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
I propoſed: for though you are of a different opinion, I do
not think that either of us could be better employed; and, ſhould
the Mufti and the Lama, whoſe challenge, you ſay, you would alſo
decline, become parties in the buſineſs, I ſhould rejoice the more.
I do not well know what you can mean by intimating, that I am a
greater Unbeliever than yourſelf; that I attack opinions which you
never maintained, and maintain principles which you never denied
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:0112200701:587"/>
If you mean to aſſert, that you are a believer in Chriſtianity, and
meant to recommend it, I muſt ſay, that your mode of writing has
been very ill adapted to gain your purpoſe. If there be any certain
method of diſcovering a man's real object, yours has been to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit
Chriſtianity in fact, while in words you repreſent yourſelf as
a friend to it: a conduct which I ſcruple not to call highly unworthy
and mean; and inſult on the common ſenſe of the Chriſtian world;
as a method of ſcreening you from the notice of the law, (which is
as hoſtile to me as it is to you,) you muſt know that it could avail
you nothing; and, though that mode of writing might be deemed
ingenious and witty in the firſt inventor of it, it has been too often
repeated to deſerve that appellation now.</p>
               <p>According to your own rule of conduct, this charge ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you to deſcend into the amphitheatre once more, as much as
the accuſation of Mr. Davis: for it is a call upon you to defend, not
your <hi>principles</hi> only, but alſo your <hi>honour.</hi> For what can reflect
greater diſhonour on a man, than to ſay one thing and mean another?
You have certainly been very far from conſining yourſelf, as you
pretend, to a ſimple narrative of authentic facts, without interpoſing
your own ſentiments. I hold no opinions, obnoxious as they are,
that I am not ready both to <hi>avow</hi> in the moſt explicit manner, and
alſo to defend with any perſon of competent judgment and ability.
Had I not conſidered you in this light, and alſo as fairly open, by
the ſtrain of your writings, to ſuch a challenge, I ſhould not have
called upon you as I have done. The Public will form its own
judgment both of that and of your ſilence on the occaſion; and
finally decide between you, the <hi>humble hiſtorian,</hi> and me, the <hi>proud
diſputant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to my <hi>reputation,</hi> for which you are ſo very obligingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
give me leave to obſerve, that, as far as it is an object with
any perſon, and a thing to be enjoyed by himſelf, it muſt depend
upon his particular notions and feelings.—Now, odd as it will appear to
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:0112200701:588"/>
you, the eſteem of a very few rational Chriſtian friends (though I know
that it will enſure me the deteſtation of the greater part of the preſent
nominally Chriſtian world that happen to hear me) given me more
real ſatisfaction, than the applauſe of what you call the philoſophic
world. I admire Servetus, by whoſe example you wiſh me to take
warning, more for his courage in dying for the cauſe of important
truth, than I ſhould have done if, beſides the certain diſcovery of
the circulation of the blood, he had made any other the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
diſcovery in philoſophy.</p>
               <p>However, I do not ſee what my philoſophical friends (of whom
I have many, and whom I think I value as I ought,) have to do with
my metaphyſical or theological writings. They may, if they pleaſe,
conſider them as my particular whims or amuſements, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
neglect them. They have, in fact, interfered very little with
my application to philoſophy, ſince I have had the means of doing
it. I was never more buſy, or more ſucceſsfully ſo, in my philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
purſuits, than during the time that I have been employed about
the Hiſtory of the Corruptions of Chriſtianity. I am at this very
time, <hi>totus in illis,</hi> as my friends know; and as the Public will
know in due time; which with me is never long, and if you had
thought proper to enter into the diſcuſſion I propoſed, it would not
have made me neglect my laboratory, or omit a ſingle experiment
that I ſhould otherwiſe have made.</p>

of the receipt of the copy of my work. You
choſe, however, to to give me a ſpecimen of your temper and feelings;

               <p>IF Dr. Prieſtley conſults his friends, he will probably learn, that a

and not relative to any public or official buſineſs, muſt always be
conſidered as <hi>private</hi> correſpondence; which a man of honour is not
at liberty to print without the conſent of the writer. That conſent

               <p>DR. Prieſtley is as unwilling to be guilty of any real impropriety
as Mr. Gibbon can wiſh him to be: but, as the correſpondence
between them relates not to any <hi>private,</hi> but only to a <hi>public matter,</hi>
he apprehends that it may, according to Mr. Gibbon's own diſtinction,
at the pleaſure of either of the parties be laid before the Public; who,
in fact, are intereſted to know, at leaſt, the reſult of it. Dr. Prieſtley's
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:0112200701:591"/>
conduct will always be open to animadverſion, that of Mr. Gibbon,
or of any other perſon. His appeal is to men of honour, and even
men of the world; and he deſires no favour.</p>
               <p>Dr. Prieſtley has ſent a ſingle copy of the correſpondence to a
friend in London, with leave to ſhew it to any other common friends,
but with a prohibition to take any other copy: but between this and
<hi>printing</hi> there is no difference, except in <hi>mode</hi> and <hi>extent.</hi> In the
eye of the law and of reaſon both are equally publications; and has
Mr. Gibbon never thought himſelf at liberty to ſhew a copy of a

               <p>Mr. Gibbon may eaſily eſcape all further altercation by diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
this mutually diſagreeable correſpondence, by leaving Dr.
Prieſtley to act as his own diſcretion or indiſcretion may dictate;

               <p>QUE j'aime la douce et parfaite confiance de nos ſentimens réci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proques!
Nous nous aimons dans l'éloignement et le ſilence, et
il nous ſuffit à l'un et à l'autre, de ſavoir de tems en tems, des nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velles
de la ſanté et du bonheur de ſon ami. Aujourd'hui j'ai beſoin
de vous écrire' je commence ſans excuſes et ſans reproches, comme
ſi nous allions reprendre la converſation familière du jour précédent.
Si je propoſois de faire un <hi>compte rendu</hi> de mes études, de mes occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,
de mes plaiſirs, de mes nouvelles liaiſons, de ma politique
toujours muette, mais un peu plus rapprochée des grands évenemens,
je multiplierois mes <hi>in quarto,</hi> et je ne ſais pas encore votre avis ſur
ceux que je vous ai dejà envoyés. Dans cette hiſtoire moderne, il
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:0112200701:592"/>
ſeroit toujours queſtion de la décadence des empires; et autant que
j'en puis juger ſur mes réminiſcences et ſur le rapport de l'ami
Bugnon, vous aimez auſſi peu la puiſſance de l'Angleterre que celle
des Romains. Notre chute, cependant, a été plus douce. Apres une
guerre ſans ſuccès, et une paix aſſez peu glorieuſe, il nous reſte de
quoi vivre contens et heureux; et lorſque je me ſuis dépouillé du
rôle de Membre du Parlement, pour redevenir homme, philoſophe,
et hiſtorien, nous pourrions bien nous trouver d'accord ſur la plus part
des ſcênes étonnantes qui viennent de ſe paſſer devant nos yeux, et
qui fourniront une riche matière aux plus habiles de mes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeurs.</p>
               <p>Bornons nous à cette heure à un objet moins illuſtre ſans doute,
mais plus intéreſſant pour tous les deux, et c'eſt beaucoup que le
même objet puiſſe intéreſſer deux mortels qui ne ſe ſont pas vûs, qui

marche aſſez vite, lorſqu'elle s'eſt une fois miſe en train;
mais une raiſon qui m'empêcheroit de lui donner carrière, c'eſt l'eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pérance
de pouvoir bientôt me ſervir avec vous d'un inſtrument
encore plus commode, la langue. Que l'homme, l'homme Anglois,
l'homme Gibbon, eſt un ſot animal! Je l'eſpere, je le deſire, je le
puis, mais je ne ſais pas ſi je le veux, encore moins ſi j'exécuterai
cette volonté. Voici mon hiſtoire, autant qu'elle pourra vous
éclairer, qu'elle pourra m'éclairer moi-même, ſur mes véritables in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
qui me paroîſſent tres obſcures, et tres équivoques; et vous
aurez la bonté de m'apprendre qu'elle ſera ma conduite future. Il
vous ſouvient, Seigneur, que mon grand pere a fait ſa fortune, que
mon pere l'a mangée avec un peu trop d'appétit, et que je jouis
actuellement du fruit, ou plutêt du reſte de leurs travaux. Vous
n'avez pas oublié que je ſuis entré au Parlement ſans patriotiſme,
ſans ambition, et que toutes mes vues ſe bornoient à la place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
et honnête d'un <hi>Lord of Trade.</hi> Cette place, je l'ai obtenue
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:0112200701:593"/>
enfin; je l'ai poſſédée trois ans, depuis 1779 juſqu' à 1782, et le
produit net, qui ſe montoit à ſept cens cinquante livres ſterling, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentoit
mon revenu, au niveau de mes beſoins, et de mes deſirs.
Mais au printems de l'année précédente, l'orage a grondé ſur nos
têtes: Milord North a été renverſé, votre ſerviteur chaſſé, et le
<hi>Board</hi> même, dont j'étois membre, aboli et caſſé pour toujours, par la
réformation de M. Burke, avec beaucoup d'autres places de l'Etat, et
de la maiſon du Roi. Pour mon malheur, je ſuis toujours reſté
Membre de la Chambre baſſe: à la fin du dernier Parlement (en
1780) M. Eliot à retiré ſa nomination; mais la faveur de Milord
North a facilité ma rentrée, et la reconnoiſance m'impoſoit le devoir
de faire valoir, pour ſon ſervice, les droits que je tenois en partie
de lui. Cet hyver nous avons combatu ſous les étendards réunis
(vous ſavez notre hiſtoire) de Milord North, et de M. Fox; nous
avons triomphé de Milord Shelburne et de la paix, et mon ami (je
n'aime pas à profaner ce nom) a remonté ſur ſa bête en qualité de
Secretaire d'Etat. C'eſt à préſent qu'il peut bien me dire: <q>C'étoit
beaucoup pour moi; ce n'étoit rien pour vous;</q> et malgré les aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
les plus fortes, j'ai trop de raiſon, pour avoir de la foi.
Avec beaucoup d'eſprit, et des qualités très reſpectables, il n'a plus ni le
titre, ni le crédit de premier miniſtre; des collegues plus actifs lui en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levent
les morceaux les plus friands, qui ſont auſſitôt dévorés par la
voracité de leurs créatures; nos malheurs et nos réformes ont diminué
le nombre des graces; par orgueil ou par pareſſe, je ſollicite auſſi mal,
et ſi je parviens enfin, ce ſera peut être à la veille d'une nouvelle
révolution, qui me fera perdre dans un inſtant, ce qui m'aura coûté
tant de ſoins et de recherches. Si je ne conſultois que mon coeur
et ma raiſon, je romprois ſur le champ cette indigne chaine de la
dépendance; je quitterois le Parlement, Londres, l'Angleterre; je
chercherois ſous un ciel plus doux, dans un pays plus tranquille, le
repos, la liberté, l' aiſance, et une ſociété éclairée et aimable. Je coule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois
quelques années de ma vie ſans eſpérance, et ſans crainte,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:0112200701:594"/>
j'acheverois mon hiſtoire, et je ne rentrerois dans ma patrie qu'en
homme libre, riche, et reſpectable par ſa poſition, auſſi bien que
par ſon caractère. Mes amis, et ſurtout Milord Sheffield, ne
veulent pas me permettre d'être heureux ſuivant mon goût et mes
lumières. Leur prudence exige que je faſſe tous mes efforts, pour
obtenir un emploi très ſur à la vérité, qui me donneroit mille guinées
de rente, mais qui m'enleveroit cinq jours par ſemaine. Je me
prête à leur zele, et je leur ai promis de ne partir qu'en automne,
après avoir conſacré l'été à cette dernière tentative. Le ſuccès, cepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
eſt très incertain, et je ne ſais ſi je le deſire de bonne foi.</p>
               <p>Si je parviens à me voir exilé, mon choix ne ſera pas douteux
Lauſanne a eu mes prémices; elle me ſera toujours chere par le doux
ſouvenir de ma jeuneſſe. Au bout de trente ans, je me rappelle les
poliſſons qui ſont aujourd'hui juges, les petites ſilles de la ſociété du
printems, qui ſont devenues grand-meres. Votre pays eſt charmant,
et, malgré le dégoût de Jean Jacques, les moeurs, et l'eſprit de ſes
habitants, me paroiſſent très aſſortis aux bords du lac Léman. Mais
un tréſor que je ne trouverois qu'à Lauſanne; c'eſt un ami qui me
convient également par les ſentimens, et les idées, avec qui je n'ai
jamais connu un inſtant d'ennui, de ſéchereſſe, ou de réſerve. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefois
dans nos libres épanchemens, nous avons cent fois fait le
projet de vivre enſemble, et cent fois nous avons épluché tous les
détails du Roman, avec une chaleur qui nous étonnoit nous memes.
A préſent il demeure, ou plutôt vous demeurez, (car je me laſſe de ce
ton étudié,) dans une maiſon charmante et commode; je vois d'ici mon
appartement, nos ſalles communes, notre table, et nos promenades;
mais ce mariage ne vaut rien, s'il ne convient pas également aux
deux époux, et je ſens combien des circonſtances locales, des goûts
nouveaux, de nouvelles liaiſons, peuvent s'oppoſer aux deſſeins, qui
nous ont paru les plus agréables dans le lointain. Pour fixer mes
idées, et pour nous épargner des regrets, il faut me dévoiler avec
la franchiſe dont je vous ai donné l'exemple, le tableau extérieur et
intérieur de George Deyverdun. Mon amour eſt trop délicat, pour
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:0112200701:595"/>
ſupporter l'indifférence et les égards, et je rougirois d'un bonheur
dont je ſerois redevable, non à l'inclination, mais à la fidélité de mon
ami. Pour m'armer contre les malheurs poſſibles, helas! peut ètre
trop vraiſemblables, j'ai eſſayé de me détacher de la penſée de ce
projet favori, et de me repréſenter à Lauſanne votre bon voiſin, ſans
être préciſement votre commenſal. Si j'y étois réduit, je ne voudrois
pas tenir maiſon, autant par raiſon d'économie, que pour éviter l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui
de manger ſeul. D'un autre côté, une penſion ouverte, fut elle
montée ſur l'ancien pied de celle de Meſery, ne conviendroit plus
à mon age, ni à mon caractère? Paſſerois je ma vie au milieu
d'une foule de jeunes Anglois échappés du college, moi qui aimerois
Lauſanne cent fois davantage, ſi j'y pouvois ètre le ſeul de ma
nation? Il me faudroit donc une maiſon commode et riante, un
état au deſſus de la bourgeoiſie, un mari inſtruit, une femme qui ne
reſembleroit pas à Madame Pavilliard; et l'aſſurance d'y être reçu
comme le fils unique, ou plutôt comme le frere de la famille. Pour
nous arranger ſans gêne, je meublerai très volontiers un joli apparte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſous le même toit, ou dans le voiſinage, et puiſque le ménage
le plus foible, laiſſe encore de l'étoffe pour une forte penſion, je ne
ſerois pas obligé de chicaner ſur les conditions pécuniaires. Si je

à ma ſeconde patrie, pour chercher un nouvel aſyle, non pas
à Geneve, triſte ſéjour du travail et de la diſcorde, mais aux-bords du
lac de Neufchatel, parmi les bons Savoyards de Chamberry, ou ſous
le beau climat des Provinces Méridionales de la France. Je finis
bruſquement, parceque j'ai mille choſes à vous dire. Je penſe que
nous nous reſſemblons pour la correſpondance. Pour le bavardage
ſavant, ou même amical, je ſuis de tous les hommes le plus pareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeux,
mais des qu'il s'agit d'un objet réel, d'un ſervice eſſentiel, le
premier Courier emporte toujours ma réponſe. A la ſin d'un mois,
je commencerai à compter les ſemaines, les jours, les heures. Ne me
les faites pas compter trop long tems. Vale.</p>

               <p>JE ne ſaurais vous exprimer, Monſieur et cher ami, la variété et la
vivacité des ſenſations que m'a fait éprouver votre lettre. Tout
cela a fini par un fond de plaiſir et d'eſpérance qui reſteront dans
mon coeur, juſqu'à ce que vous les en chaſſiez.</p>
               <p>Un rapport ſingulier de circonſtances contribue à me faire eſpérer
que nous ſommes deſtinés à vivre quelque tems agréablement en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble.
Je ne ſuis pas dégoûté d'une ambition que je ne connus
jamais; mais par d'autres circonſtances, je me trouve dans la même
ſituation d'embarras et d'incertitude où vous êtes auſſi à cette
époque. Il y a un an que votre lettre, mon cher ami, m'auroit fait
plaiſir ſans doute, mais en ce moment, elle m'en fait bien davantage:
elle vient en quelque façon à mon ſecours.</p>
               <p>Depuis mon retour d'Italie, ne pouvant me déterminer à vendre
ma maiſon, m'ennuyant d'y être ſeul (car je ſuis comme vous, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,
et je déteſte de manger ſans compagnie) ne voulant pas loue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r
à des étrangers, j'ai pris le parti de m'arranger aſſez joliment au
premier étage, et de donner le ſecond à une famille de mes amis,
qui me nourrit, et que je loge. Cet arrangement a paru pendant
long tems contribuer au bonheur des deux parties. Mais tout eſt
tranſitoire ſur cette terre. Ma maiſon ſera vuide, ſelon tout appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
ſur la ſin de l'été, et je me vois d'avance tout auſſi embaraſſé
et incertain, que je l'étais il y a quelques années, ne ſachant quelle
nouvelle ſociété choiſir, et aſſez diſpoſé à vendre enfin cette poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
qui m'a cauſé bien des plaiſirs, et bien des peines. Ma
maiſon eſt donc à votre diſpoſition pour cet automne, et vous y
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:0112200701:597"/>
arriveriez comme un Dieu dans une machine qui finit l'embroglio
Voilà quant à moi; parlons de vous maintenant avec la même ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cérité.</p>
               <p>Un mot de préambule. Qulque intéreſſé que je ſois à votre
réſolution, convaincu qu'il faut aimer ſes amis pour eux mêmes,
ſentant d'ailleurs combien il ſeroit affreux pour moi de vous voir des
regrets, je vous donne ici ma parole d'honneur, que mon intérêt n'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flue
en rien ſur ce que je vais écrire, et que je ne dirai pas un mot
que je ne vous diſſe, ſi l'hermite de la grotte etoit un autre que moi.
Vos amis Anglais vous aiment pour eux mêmes: je ne veux moi
que votre bonheur. Rappellez vous, mon cher ami, que je vis
avec peine votre entrée dans le Parlement, et je crois n'avoir été que
trop bon prophete; je ſuis ſur que cette carrière vous a fait éprouver
plus de privations que de jouiſſances, beaucoup plus de peines que
de plaiſirs; j'ai cru toujours, depuis que je vous ai connu, que vous
étiez deſtiné à vivre heureux par les plaiſirs du cabinet et de la ſociété,
que tout autre marche était un écart de la route du bonheur, et que
ce n'etait que les qualités réunies d'homme de lettres, et d'homme
aimable de ſociété, qui pouvoient vous procurer gloire, honneur,
plaiſirs, et un ſuite continuelle de jouiſſances. Au bout de quelques
tours dans votre ſalle, vous ſentirez parfaitement que j'avois bien vu,
et que l'évenement a juſtifié mes idées. Lorſque j'ai appris que vous
étiez <hi>Lord of Trade,</hi> j'en ai été faché; quand j'ai ſu que vous aviez
perdu cette place, je m'en ſuis réjouis pour vous; quand on m'a
anoncé que Milord North étoit remonté ſur ſa bête, j'ai cru vous
voir très mal à votre aiſe, en croupe derrière lui, et je m'en ſuis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligé
pour vous. Je ſuis donc charmé, mon cher ami, de vous ſavoir
à pied, et je vous conſeille très ſincèrement de reſter dans cette poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
et bien loin de ſolliciter la place en queſtion, de la refuſer, ſi elle
vous était offerte. Mille guinées vous dédommageront elles de cinq
jours pris de la ſemaine? Je ſuppoſe, ce que cependant j'ai peine à
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:0112200701:598"/>
croire, que vous me diſiez que oui: et la variété et l'inconſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuelle
de votre miniſtère, vous promettent elles d'en jouir long tems
conſtamment, et n'eſt il pas plus déſagréable, mon cher Monſieur, de
n'avoir plus 1000 livres ſterl. de rente, qu'il n'a été agréable d'en
jouir? D'ailleurs ne pourrez vous pas toujours rentrer dans la car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rière,
ſi l'ambition ou l'envie de ſervir la patrie, vous reprennent; ne
rentrerez vous pas avec plus d'honneur, lorſque vos rentes étant aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentées
naturellement, vous ſerez libre et indépendant?</p>
               <p>En faiſant cette retraite en Suiſſe, outre la beauté du pays, et les
agrémens de la ſociété, vous acquererez deux biens que vous avez
perdus, la liberté et la richeſſe. Vous ne ſerez d'ailleurs point
inutile; vos ouvrages continueront à nous éclairer, et independam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
de vos talens, l'honnête homme, le galant homme, n'eſt jamais
inutile.</p>
               <p>Il me reſte à vous préſente le tableau que vous trouveriez. Vous
aimiez ma maiſon et mon jardin, c'eſt bien autre choſe à préſent.
Au premier étage qui donne ſur la deſcente d'Ouchy, je me ſuis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangé
un appartement qui me ſuffit, j'ai une chambre de domeſtique,
deux ſallons, et deux cabinets. J'ai au plein pied de la terraſſe,
deux autres ſallons dont l'un ſert en été de ſalle à manger, et l'autre
de ſallon de compagnie. J'ai fait un nouvel appartement de trois
pièces dans le vuide entre la maiſon et la remiſe, en ſorte que j'ai à
vous offrir tout le grand appartement, qui conſiſte actuellement en
onze pièces, tant grandes que petites, tournées au Levant et au Midi,
meublées ſans magnificence déplacée, mais avec une ſorte d'élégance
dont j'eſpère que vous ſeriez ſatisfait. La terraſſe a peu changé;
mais elle eſt terminée par un grand cabinet mieux proportionné que le
précédent, garnie tout du long, de caiſſes d'orangers, &amp;c. La treille,
qui ne vous eſt pas indifférente, a embelli, proſpéré, et regne preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu'entièrement
juſqu'au bout; parvenu à ce bout, vous trouverez un
petit chemin qui vous conduira à une chaumière placée dans un coin;
et de ce coin, en ſuivant le long d'une autre route à l'Anglaiſe, le
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:0112200701:599"/>
mur d'un manége. Vous trouverez au bout, un chalet avec écurie,
vacherie, petite porte, petit cabinet, petite bibliothèque, et une galerie
de bois doré, d'où l'on voit tout ce qui ſort et entre en ville par la porte
du Chêne, et tout ce qui ſe paſſe dans ce Faubourg. J'ai acquis la
vigne au-deſſous du jardin; j'en ai arraché tout ce qui étoit devant
la maiſon; j'en ai fait un tapis vert, arroſé par l'eau du jet d'eau; et
j'ai fait tout autour de ce petit parc, une promenade très variée par
les différens points de vue et les objets même intérieurs, tantot
jardin potager, tantot parterre, tantot vigne, tantot près, puis chalet,
chaumiere, petite montagne; bref, les étrangers viennent le voir et
l'admirent, et malgré la deſcription pompeuſe que je vou en fais,
vous en ſerez content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> J'ai planté une quantité d'excellens arbres fruitiers.</p>
               <p>Venons à moi; vous comprenez bien que j'ai vieilli, excepté pour
la ſenſibilité; je ſuis à la mode, mes nerfs ſont attaqués; je ſuis plus
mélancolique, mais je n'ai pas plus d'humeur; vous ne ſouffrirez
de mes maux que tout au plus négativement. Enſemble, et ſéparés
par nos logemens, nous jouirons vis-à-vis l'un de l'autre, de la plus
grande liberté. Nous prendrons une gouvernante douce et entendue,
plutôt par commoditè que par néceſſité; car je me chargerois ſans
crainte de la ſurintendance. J'ai fait un ménage de quatre, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
quelque tems; j'ai fait le mien, et j'ai remarqué que cela mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choit
tout ſeul, quand c'étoit une fois en train. Les petites gens qui
n'ont que ce mérite, font grand bruit pour rien. Mon jardin nous
fournira avec abondance de bons fruits et d'excellens légumes.
Pour la reſte de la table et de la dépenſe domeſtique, je ne demanderais
pas mieux que de vous reçevoir chez moi, comme vous m'avez reçu
chez vous; mais nos ſituations ſont différentes à cet egard; cepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
ſi vous etiez plus ruiné, je vous l'offrirois ſans doute, et je
devrois le faire; mais avec les rentes que vous aviez, quand j'étois
chez vous, en les ſuppoſant même diminuées, vous vivrez très agré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablement
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:0112200701:600"/>
ablement à Lauſanne. Enfin à cet égard nous nous arrangerons,
comme il vous ſera le plus agréable, et en proportion de nos revenus.
Toujours ſerez vous ainſi, à ce qui j'eſpère, plus décemment et plus
comfortablement, que vous ne ſeriez par tout ailleurs au même prix.</p>
               <p>Quant à la ſociété, quoique infiniment agréable, je commence ce
chapitre par vous dire que j'éviterois de vous y inviter, ſi vous étiez
entièrement déſoeuvré; les jours ſont longs alors, et laiſſent bien
du vuide; mais homme de lettres, comme vous êtes, je ne connois
point de ſociété qui vous convienne mieux. Nous aurona autour de
nous un cercle, comme il ſeroit impoſſible d'en trouver ailleurs dans
un auſſi petit eſpace. Madame de Corcelles, Mademoiſelle Sulens, et
M. de Montolieu (Madame eſt morte), Meſſrs. Polier et leurs fem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
Madame de Severy, et M. et Madame de Naſſau, Mademoiſelle
de Chandieu, Madame de St. Cierge, et M. avec leurs deux filles
jolies et aimables, Madames de Crouſaz, Polier, de Charrieres, &amp;c.
font un fonds de bonne compagnie dont on ne ſe laſſe point, et dont
M. de Servan eſt ſi content qu'il regrette toujours d'être obligé de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourner
dans ſes terres, et ne reſpire que pour s'établir tout à fait à
Lauſanne. Il paſſa tout l'hyver de 1782 avec nous, et il fut, on ne
peut plus, agréable. Vous trouverez les moeurs changées en bien,
et plus conformes à nos ages, et à nos caractères; peu de grandes
aſſemblées, de grands repas, mais beaucoup de petits ſoupers, de
petites aſſemblées, où l'on fait ce qu' on veut, où l'on cauſe, lit, &amp;c.
ct dont on écarte avec ſoin les facheux de toute eſpece. Il y le
Dimanche un ſociété, où tout ce qu'il y a d'un peu diſtingué en
étrangères et étrangers, eſt invité. Cela fait des aſſemblées de 40 à 50
perſonnes, où l'on voit ce qu'on ne voit gueres le reſte de la ſemaine,
et ces eſpeces de <hi>rout</hi> font quelquefois plaiſir. Nous ſommes fort
dégoutés des étrangers, ſurtout des jeunes gens, et nous les écartons
avec ſoin de nos petits comités, à moins qu'ils n'ayent du mérite, ou
quelques talens. A cet égard un de nos petits travers, c'eſt l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouement;
mais vous en profiterez, mon cher Monſieur, comme
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:0112200701:601"/>
Edward Gibbon, et comme mon ami; vous ferez d'abord l'homme à
la mode, et je vois d'ici que vous ſoutiendrez fort bien ce rôle, ſans
vous en fàcher, dût on un peu vous ſurfaire. <hi>Je ſens que tu me
flattes, mais tu me fais plaiſir,</hi> eſt peut être le meilleur vers de Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touches.
Voilà donc l'hyver; l'étude le matin, quelques converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
quand vous ſerez fatigué, avec quelque homme de lettres, ou
amateur, ou du moins qui aura vu quelque choſe; à l'heure qu'il
vous plaira un diner, point de ſermier général, mais l'honnête épi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curien,
avec un ou deux amis quand vous voudrez; puis quelques
viſites, une ſoirée, ſouvent un ſouper. Quant à l'été, vu votre manière
d'aimer la campagne, on diroit que ma remiſe a été faite pour vous;
pendant que vous vous y promenerez en ſénateur, je ſerai ſouvent en
bon payſan Suiſſe, devant mon chalet, ou dans ma chaumière; puis
nous nous rencontrerons tout à coup, et tâcherons de nous remettre
au niveau l'un de l'autre. Nous fermerons nos portes à l'ordinaire,
excepté aux étrangers qui paſſent leur chemin; mais quand nous
voudrons, nous y aurons tous ceux que nous aimerons à y voir:
car on ne demande pas mieux que d'y venir ſe rejouir. J'ai eu, un
beau jour d'Avril ce printems, un déjeûner, qui m'a coûté quelques
Louis, ou il y avait plus de 40 perſonnes, je ne ſais combien de
petites tables, une bonne muſique au milieu du verger, et une quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tité
de jeunes et jolies perſonnes danſant des branles, et formant des
chifres en cadence; j'ai vu bien des fètes, j'en ai peu vu de plus
jolies. Quand mon pare vous ennuyera, nous aurous, ou nous
louerons enſemble (et ce ſera ainſi un plaiſir peu cher) un cabriolet
léger, avec deux chevaux gentils, et nous irons viſiter nos amis
diſperſés dans les campagnes, qui nous recevront à bras ouverts. Vous
en ſerez content de nos campagnes; toujours en proportion vous
comprenez, et vous trouverez en général un heureux changement
pour les agrémens de la ſociété, et une ſorte de recherche ſimple,
mas élégante. Les bergères du <hi>printems,</hi> excepté Madame de Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,
ne ſont ſans doute plus préſentables, mais il y en a d'autres aſſez
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:0112200701:602"/>
gentilles, et quoiqu'elles ne ſoyent pas en bien grand nombre, il y
en aura toujours aſſez pour vous, mon cher Monſieur. Peu à peu
mon imagination m'a emporté, et mon ſtyle s'égaye, comme cela
nous arrivait quelquefois dans nos chateaux en Eſpagne. Il eſt bien
tems de finir cet article, réſumons nous plus ſérieuſement.</p>
               <p>Si vous exécutez le plan que vous avez imaginé, j'aimerois même
à dire que vous embraſſez, ſurtout d'après ce que vous marquez
vous même, <hi>Si je ne conſultatis que mon coeur et ma raiſon, je romprois
ſur le champ cette indigne chaine,</hi> &amp;c. Eh! que voulez vous conſulter,
ſi ce n'eſt votre coeur et votre raiſon? Si, dis-je, vous exécutez
ce plan, vous retrouverez une liberté et une indépendance, que vous
n'auriez jamais du perdre, et dont vous méritez de jouir, une aiſance
qui ne vous coûtera qu'un voyage de quelques jours, une tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lité
que vous ne pouvez avoir à Londres, et enfin un ami qui n'a peut
être pas été un jour ſans penſer à vous, et qui malgré ſes défauts,
ſes foibleſſes et ſon infériorité, eſt encore un des compagnons qui
vous convient le mieux.</p>
               <p>Il me reſte à vous apprendre pourquoi je vous réponds ſi tard:
vous ſavez dejà actuellement que ce n'eſt pas manque d'amitié et de
zele pour la choſe; mais votre lettre m'a été renvoyée de Lauſanne
ici, à Straſbourg, et je n'ai paſſé qu'une poſte ſans y répondre, ce qui
n'eſt pas trop, vous l'avouerez, pour un pareil bavardage. Je ſuis
parti de Lauſanne la veille de Pâques pour venir voir un M. Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
de Baſle, fort de mes amis; il eſt ici auprès du Comte de
Caglioſtro, pour proſiter de ſes remédes. Vous aurez entendu parler
peut être de cet homme extraordinaire à tous égards. Comme j'ai
été aſſez malade tout l'hyver, je profite auſſi de ſes remèdes; mais
comme le tems du ſéjour du Comte ici n'eſt rien moins que ſur, le
mieux ſera que vous m'écriviez <hi>à M. D. chez M. Bourcard du Kirſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garten,
à Baſle.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="582" facs="tcp:0112200701:603"/>
Vous comprenez combien à tous égards, il eſt néceſſaire m'écrire
ſans perte de tems, dèſque vous aurez pris une réſolution. Adieu,
mon cher ami.</p>

               <p>JE reçois votre lettre du 10 Juin, le 21 de ce mois. Aujourd'hui
Mardi 24th, je mets la main à la plume (comme dit M. Fréron)
pour y répondre, quoique ma miſſive ne puiſſe partir par arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
des poſtes, que Vendredi prochain, 27 du courant. O merveille,
de la grace efficace! Elle n'agit pas moins puiſſamment ſur vous,
et moyennant le ſecours toujours prêt, et toujours prompt de nos
couriers, un mois nous ſuffit pour la demande et la réponſe. Je
remercie mille fois le génie de l'amitié, qui m'a pouſſé, après mille
efforts inutiles, à vous écrire enfin au moment le plus critique et le
plus favorable. Jamais démarche n'a répondu ſi parfaitement à tous
mes voeux et à toutes mes eſpérances. Je comptois ſans doute ſur
la durée et la vérité de vos ſentimens; mais j'ignorois (telle eſt la
foibleſſe humaine) juſqu'à quel point ils avoient pu être attiédis par le
tems et l'éloignement; et je ſavois encore moins l'état actuel de
votre ſanté, de votre fortune et de vos liaiſons, qui auroient pu
oppoſer tant d'obſtacles à notre réunion. Vous m'écrivez, vous
m'aimez toujours; vous déſirez avec zele, avec ardeur, de réaliſer nos
anciens projets; vous le pouvez, vous le voulez; vous m'oſſrez dès
l'automne votre maiſon, et quelle maiſon! votre terraſſe, et quelle
terraſſe! votre ſociété, et quelle ſociété! L'arrangement nous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
à tous les deux; je retrouve à la fois le compagnon de ma
jeuneſſe, un ſage conſeiller, et un peintre qui ſait repréſenter et
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:0112200701:604"/>
exagérer même les objets les plus rians. Ces exagérations me font
pour le moins autant de plaiſir, que la ſimple vérité. Si votre
portrait étoit tout à fait reſſemblant, ces agrémens n'exiſteroient
que hors de nous mêmes, et j'aime encore mieux les trouver dans
la vivacité de votre coeur et de votre imagination. Ce n'eſt pas que
je ne reconnoiſſe un grand fond de vérité dans le tableau de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne;
je connois le lieu de la ſcêne, je me tranſporte en idée ſur
notre terraſſe, je vois ces côteaux, ce lac, ces montagnes, ouvrages
favoris de la nature, et je conçois ſans peine les embelliſſemens que
votre goût s'eſt plu y ajouter. Je me rappelle depuis vingt ou trente
ans les moeurs, l'eſprit, l'aiſance de la ſociété, et je comprends que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
véritable ton de la bonne compagnie ſe perpétue, et s'épure de pere
en fils, ou plutôt de mere en fille; car il m'a toujours paru qu'à Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne,
auſſi bien qu'en France, les femmes ſont très ſupérieures aux
hommes. Dans un parcil ſéjour, je craindrois la diſſipation bien
plus que l'ennui, et le tourbillon de Lauſanne étonneroit un phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophe
accoutumé, depuis tant d'années à la tranquillité de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres.
Vous êtes trop inſtruit pour regarder ce propos, comme
une mauvaiſe plaiſanterie; c'eſt dans les détroits qu'on eſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trainé
par la rapidité des courans: il n'y en a point en pleine
mer. Dèſqu'on ne recherche plus les plaiſirs bruyans, et qu'on
s'affranchit volontiers des devoirs pénibles, la liberté d'un ſimple
particulier ſe fortifie par l'immenſité de la ville. Quant à moi,
l'application à mon grand ouvrage, l'habitude, et la récompenſe
du travail, m'ont rendu plus ſtudieux, plus ſédentaire, plus ami de
la retraite. La chambre des communes et les grands dìners exigent
beaucoup de tems; et la tempérance d'un repas Anglois, vous permet
de goûter de cinq ou ſix vins différens, et vous ordonne de boire une
bouteille de claret après le déſert. Mais enfin je ne ſoupe jamais, je
me couche de bonne heure, je reçois peu de viſites, les matinées ſont
longues, les étés ſont libres, et dèſque je ferme ma porte; je ſuis oublié
du Monde entier. Dans une ſociété plus bornée et plus amicale, les
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:0112200701:605"/>
démarches ſont publiques, les droits ſont réciproques, l'on dine
de bonne heure, on ſe goûte trop pour ne pas paſſer l'après-midi
enſemble; on ſoupe, on veille, et les plaiſirs de la ſoirée ne laiſſent
pas de déranger le repos de la nuit, et le travail du lendemain Quel
eſt cependant le réſultat de ces plaintes? c'eſt ſeulement que la mariée
eſt trop belle, et que j'oſe me ſervir de l'excuſe honnête de la ſanté
et du privilege d'un homme de lettres; il ne tiendra qu'à moi de
modérer un peu l'excès de mes jouiſſances. Pour cet engouement
que vous m'annoncez, et qui a toujours été le défaut des peuples les
plus ſpirituels, je l'ai dejà éprouvé ſur un plus grand théâtre. Il y a
ſix ans que l'ami de Madame Necker fut reçu à Paris, comme celui
de George Deyverdum pourroit l'être à Lauſanne. Je ne connois
rien de plus flateur que cet accueil favorable d'un public poli et
éclairé. Mais cette faveur, ſi douce pour l'étranger, n'eſt-elle pas
un peu dangereuſe pour l'habitant expoſé à voir flétrir ſes lauriers,
par ſa faute ou par l'inconſtance des ſes juges? Non; on ſe ſoutient
toujours, peut être pas préciſement, au même point d'élévation.
À l'abri de trois gros volumes in quarto en langue étrangère, encore
ce qui n'eſt pas un petit avantage, je conſerverai toujours la réputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
littéraire, et cette réputation donnera du relief aux qualités
ſociales, ſi l'on trouve l'hiſtorien ſans travers, ſans affectation et
ſans prétenſions. Je ſerai donc charmé et content de votre ſociété,
et j'aurois pu dire en deux mots, ce qui j'ai bavardé en deux pages;
mais il y a tant de plaiſir à bavarder avec un ami! car enſin je
poſſède à Lauſanne un véritable ami; et les ſimples connoiſſances
remplaceront ſans beaucoup de peine, tout ce qui s'appelle liaiſon, et
même amitié, dans ce vaſte déſert de Londres. Mais au moment ou
j'écris, je vois de tous côtés une foule d'objets dont la perte ſera bien
plus difficile à réparer. Vous connoſſiez ma bibliothèque; mais je
ſuis en état de vous rendre le propos de votre maiſon <hi>c'eſt bien
autre choſe à cette heure;</hi> formée peu à peu, mais avec beaucoup de
ſoin et de dépenſe, elle peut ſe nommer aujourd'hui un beau cabinet de
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:0112200701:606"/>
particulier. Non content de remplir à rangs redoublés la meilleure
piece qui lui étoit deſtinée, elle s'eſt débordée dans la chambre ſur la
rue, dans votre ancienne chambre à coucher, dans la mienne, dans
tous les recoins de la maiſon de <hi>Bentinck-ſtreet,</hi> et juſques dans une
chaumière que je me ſuis donnée à <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>J'ai mille courtiſans rangés autour de moi:</l>
                  <l>Ma retraite eſt mon Louvre, et j'y commande en roi.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Le fonds eſt de la meilleure compagnie Grecque, Latine, Italienne,
Françoiſe, et Angloiſe, et les auteurs les moins chers à l'homme de goût,
des eccléſiaſtiques, des Byzantins, des Orientaux, ſont les plus néceſſaires
à l'hiſtorien de la décadence et de la chute, &amp;c. Vous ne ſentez que
trop bien le déſagrément de laiſſer, et l'impoſſibilité de tranſporter
cinq ou ſix milles volumes, d'autant plus que le ciel n'a pas voulu
faire de la Suiſſe, un pays maritime. Cependant mon zele pour la
réuſſite de nos projets communs, me fait imaginer que ces obſtacles
pourront s'applanir, et que je puis adoucir ou ſupporter ces privations
douloureuſes. Les bons auteurs claſſiques, la bibliotheque des nations,
ſe retrouvent dans tous les pays. Lauſanne n'eſt pas dépourvu de
livres, ni de politeſſe, et j'ai dans l'eſprit qu'on pourroit acquérir pour
un certain tems, quelque bibliotheque d'un vieillard ou d'un mineur,
dont la famille ne voudroit pas ſe défaire entièrement. Quant aux
outils de mon travail, nous commencerons par examiner l'état de
nos richeſſes; apres quoi il faudroit faire un petit calcul du prix, du
poids et de la rareté de chaque ouvrage, pour juger de ce qu'il
ſeroit néceſſaire de tranſporter de Londres, et de ce qu'on acheteroit
plus commodément en Suiſſe; à l'égard de ces frais, on devroit les
enviſager comme les avances d'une manufacture tranſplantée en pays
étranger, et dont on eſpere retirer dans la ſuite un profit raiſonnable.
Malheureuſement votre bibliotheque publique, en y ajoutant même
celle de M. de Bochat, eſt aſſez piteuſe; mais celles de Berne et de
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:0112200701:607"/>
Baſle ſont très nombreuſes, et je compterois aſſez ſur la bonhommie
Helvétique, pour eſpérer que, moyennant des recommandations et
des cautions, il me ſeroit permis d'en tirer les livres dont j'aurois
eſſentiellement beſoin. Vous êtes très bien placé pour prendre les
informations, et pour fixer les démarches convenables; mais vous
voyez du moins combien je me retourne de tous les côtés, pour
eſquiver la difficulté la plus formidable.</p>
               <p>Venons à preſent à des objets moins relevés, mais très importans
à l'exiſtence et au bien être de l'animal, le logement, les domeſtiques,
et la table. Pour mon appartement particulier, une chambre à
coucher, avec un grand cabinet et une antichambre, auroient ſuffi à
tous mes beſoins; mais ſi vous pouvez vous en paſſer, je me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menerai
avec plaiſir dans l'immenſité de vos onze pieces, qui s'ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoderont
ſans doute aux heures et aux ſaiſons différentes. L'article
des domeſtiques renferme une aſſez forte difficulté, ſur la quelle je
dois vous conſulter. Vous connoiſſez, et vous eſtimez Caplin mon
valet de chambre, maitre d'hotel, &amp;c. qui a été nourri dans notre
maiſon, et qui comptoit y finir ſes jours. Depuis votre départ,
ſes talens et ſes vertus ſe ſont développés de plus en plus, et je le
conſidere bien moins ſur le pied d'un domeſtique, que ſur celui
d'un ami. Malheureuſement il ne ſait que l'Anglois, et jamais il
n'apprendra de langue étrangère. Il m'accompagna, il y a ſix ans,
dans mon voyage à Paris, mais il rapporta fidelement à Londres
toute l'ignorance, et tous les préjugés d'un bon patriote. À Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne
il me coûteroit beaucoup, et à l'exception du ſervice perſonel,
il ne nous ſeroit que d'une très petite utilité. Cependant je ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porterois
volontiers cette dépenſe, mais je ſuis très perſuadé que, ſi
ſon attachement le portoit à me ſuivre, il s'ennuyeroit à mourir dans
un pays où tout lui ſeroit étranger et déſagréable. Il faudroit donc
me détacher d'un homme dont je connois le zele, la fidélité, rompre
tout d'un coup de petites habitudes qui ſont liées avec le bien être
journalier et momentané, et ſe reſoudre à lui ſubſtituer un viſage
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:0112200701:608"/>
nouveau, peut être un mauvais ſujet, toujours quelque avanturier
Suiſſe pris ſur le pavé de Londres. Vous rappellez vous un certain
Georges Suiſſe qui a fait autrefois avec moi, le voyage de France et
d'Italie? Je le crois marié et établi à Lauſanne; s'il vit encore, ſi
vous pouvez l'engager à ſe rendre ici, pour me ramener en Suiſſe,
la compagnie d'un bon et ancien ſerviteur ne laiſſeroit pas d'adoucir
la chute, et il reſteroit peut être aupres de moi, juſqu'à ce que nous
euſſions choiſi un jeune homme du pays, adroit, modeſte et bien
élevé, à qui je ferois un parti avantageux. Les autres domeſtiques,
gouvernantes, laquais, cuiſinière, &amp;c. ſe prennent et ſe renvoyent
ſans difficulté. Un article bien plus important, c'eſt notre table, car
enfin nous ne ſommes pas aſſez hermites, pour nous contenter des
légumes et des fruits de votre jardin, tout excellens qu'ils ſont; mais
je n'ai preſque rien à ajouter à l'honnêteté de vos propos, qui me
donnent beaucoup plus de plaiſir que de ſurpriſe. Si je me trouvois
ſans fortune, au lieu de rougir des bienfaits de l'amitié, j'accepterois
vos offres auſſi ſimplement que vous les faites. Mais nous ne ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
pas réduits à ce point, et vous comprenez aſſez qu'une décon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiture
Angloiſe laiſſe encore une fortune fort décente au Pays de Vaud,
et pour vous dire quelque choſe de plus précis, je dépenſerois ſans
peine et ſans inconvenient cinq ou ſix cens Louis. Vous connoiſſez
le réſultat auſſi bien que les détails d'un ménage; en ſuppoſant une
petite table de deux philoſophes Epicuriens, quatre, cinq, ou ſix
domeſtiques, des amis aſſez ſouvent, des repas aſſez rarement, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coup
de ſenſualité, et peu de luxe, à combien eſtimez vous en gros
le dépenſe d'un mois et d'une année? Le partage que vous avez dejà
fait, me paroît des plus raiſonnables; vous me logez, et je vous
nourris. À votre calcul, j'ajouterois mon entretien perſonnel, habits,
plaiſirs, gages de domeſtiques, &amp;c. et je verrois d'une manière aſſez
nette, l'enſemble de mon petit établiſſement.</p>
               <p>Apres avoir eſſuyé tant de détails minutiex, le cher lecteur s'ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

de vous à Lauſanne; et ſi je parviens à la place (<hi>Commiſſioner of the
Exciſe or Cuſtoms</hi>) ou je viſe, il y aura toutes les ſemaines cinq
longues matinées, qui m'avertiront de la folie de mon choix. Vous
vous trompez à la vérité à l'égard de l'inſtabilité de ces emplois; ils
ſont preſques les ſeuls qui ne ſe reſſentent jamais des révolutions du
miniſtère. Cependant ſi cette place s'offroit bientôt, je n'aurois pas le
bon ſens et le courage de la refuſer. Quels autres conſeillers veux je

toujours écoutés: les égards, la mauvaiſe honte, tous mes amis, ou

Samedi de Straſbourg, pendant que je venois içi, votre ſeconde lettre
alloit là, et qu'ainſi je reçus, votre troiſième, Dimanche, et votre

je n'ai pu rien trouver dans la première, m'a fait comprendre qu'il y en
avoit une ſeconde, et j'ai cru devoir attendre un courier, la troiſième
n'exigeant pas de réponſe.</p>
               <p>Pour votre parole, permettez que je vous en diſpenſe encore, et
même juſqu'au dernier jour, je ſens bien qu'un procédé contraire,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:0112200701:611"/>
vous conviendroit; mais certes il ne me convient pas du tout. Ceci,
comme vous le dites, eſt une eſpèce de mariage, et penſez vous que
malgré les engagemens les plus ſolemnels, je n'euſſe pas reconduit
chez elle, du pied des autels, la femme la plus aimable qui m'eut
temoigné des regrets. Jamais je ne me conſolerois, ſi je vous voyois
mécontent dans la ſuite, et dans le cas de me faire des reproches.
C'eſt à vous à faire, ſi vous croyez néceſſaire, des démarches de votre
côté, qui fortifient votre réſolution; pour moi, je n'en ferai point d'eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentielles,
juſqu'à ce que j'aye reçu encore une lettre de vous. Après
ce petit préambule, parlons toujours comme ſi l'affaire étoit décidée,
et repaſſons votre lettre. Tout ce que vous dites des grandes et
petites villes, eſt très vrai, et votre comparaiſon des détroits et de la
pleine mer, eſt on ne peut pas plus juſte et agréable; mais enfin,
<hi>comme on fait ſon lit, on ſe couche,</hi> diſoit Sancho Pancha d'agréable

qui, n'ayant ni devoirs d'état ni de ſang à remplir, peut vivre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tièrement

même, bourgeois et citoyen de la ville, je ſuis preſqu'entièrement
libre. L'été, par exemple, je déteſte de m'enfermer le ſoir dans des
chambres chaudes, pour faire une partie. Eh bien! on m'a perſé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuté
un peu la première année; à preſent on me laiſſe en repos. Il y
aura ſans doute quelque changement dans votre manière de vivre;
mais il me ſemble qu'on ſe fait aiſement à cela. Les diners, ſurtout
en femmes, ſont très rares; les ſoupers peu grands; on reſte plutôt
pour être enſemble, que pour manger, et pluſieurs perſonnes ne s'aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyent

               <p>Pour les bibliotheques publiques, votre idée ne pourroit, je penſe,

               <p>YOU will read the following lines with more patience and attention
than you would probably give to an haſty conference, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
interrupted by the opening of the door, and perhaps by the
quickneſs of our own tempers. I neither expect nor deſire an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
on a ſubject of extreme importance to myſelf, but which
friendſhip alone can render intereſting to you. We ſhall ſoon meet
at Sheffield.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to repeat the reflections which we have ſometimes
debated together, and which I have often ſeriouſly weighed in my
ſilent ſolitary walks. Notwithſtanding your active and ardent ſpirit,
you muſt allow that there is ſome perplexity in my preſent ſituation,
and that my future proſpects are diſtant and cloudy. I have lived
too long in the world to entertain a very ſanguine idea of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or zeal of miniſterial patrons; and we are all ſenſible how much
the powers of patronage are reduced. * * *.
At the end of the Parliament, or rather
long before that time, (for their lives are not worth a year's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,)
our Miniſters are kicked down ſtairs, and I am left their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted
friend, to fight through another oppoſition, and to expect
the fruits of another revolution. But I will take a more favourable
ſuppoſition, and conceive myſelf in ſix months firmly ſeated at the
board of cuſtoms; before the end of the next ſix months I ſhould
infallibly hang myſelf. Inſtead of regretting my diſappointment, I
rejoice in my eſcape; as I am ſatisfied that no ſalary could pay me
for the irkſomeneſs of attendance, and the drudgery of buſineſs ſo
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:0112200701:615"/>
repugnant to my taſte, (and I will dare to ſay,) ſo unworthy of my
character. Without looking forwards to the poſſibility, ſtill more
remote, of exchanging that laborious office for a ſmaller annuity,
there is ſurely another plan, more reaſonable, more ſimple, and more
pleaſant; a temporary retreat to a quiet and leſs expenſive ſcene.
In a four years reſidence at Lauſanne, I ſhould live within my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
ſave, and even accumulate, my ready money; finiſh my
Hiſtory, an object of profit, as well as fame, expect the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of elderly lives, and return to England at the age of fifty,
to form a laſting independent eſtabliſhment, without courting the
ſmiles of a Miniſter, or apprehending the downfal of a party. Such
have been my ſerious ſober reflections. Yet I much queſtion,
whether I ſhould have found courage to follow my reaſon and
my inclination, if a friend had not ſtretched his hand to draw me
out of the dirt. The twentieth of laſt May I wrote to my friend
Deyverdun, after a long interval of ſilence, to expoſe my ſituation,
and to conſult in what manner I might beſt arrange myſelf at Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne.
From his anſwer, which I received about a fortnight ago,
I have the pleaſure to learn, that his heart and his houſe are both
open for my reception; that a family which he had lodged for ſome
years is about to leave him, and that at no other time my company
could have been ſo acceptable and convenient. I ſhall ſtep, at my
arrival, into an excellent apartment and a delightful ſituation; the fair
diviſion of our expences will render them very moderate, and I ſhall
paſs my time with the companion of my youth, whoſe temper and
ſtudies have alwayes been congenial to my own. I have given him
my word of honour to be at Lauſanne in the beginning of October,
and no power or perſuaſion can divert me from this IRREVOCABLE
reſolution, which I am every day proceeding to execute.</p>
               <p>I wiſh, but I ſcarcely hope, to convince you of the propriety of
my ſcheme; but at leaſt you will allow, that when we are not able to
prevent the <hi>follies</hi> of our friends, we ſhould ſtrive to render them as
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:0112200701:616"/>
eaſy and harmleſs as poſſible. The arrangement of my houſe, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
and books will be left to meaner hands, but it is to your zeal
and judgment alone that I can truſt the more important diſpoſal of
Lenborough and * * *. On theſe ſubjects we may go
into a committee at Sheffield-Place, but you know it is the rule of a
committee, not to hear any arguments againſt the <hi>principle</hi> of the
bill. At preſent I ſhall only obſerve, that neither of theſe negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ought to detain me here; the former may be diſpatched as well,
the latter much better, in my abſence. <hi>Vale.</hi>

rendu à mes raiſons, ou plutôt aux votres. Il eſt charmé du tableau
de votre première lettre, et malgré l'activité de ſon ame, au lieu de
me condamner, il me porte envie; et nous diſputons (un peu en
l'air) ſur le projet d'une viſite que lui, ſon amiable compagne et ſa
fille ainée, ſe propoſent de nous faire dans deux ans aux bords du
Lac Léman. Bien loin de combattre mon deſſein, il me conſeille,
il me ſeconde dans l'exécution, et je n'aurai pas beſoin de recourir
aux lumières de votre ami Louis Teyſſier, d'autant plus que pour les
menus détails de la correſpondence étrangère, je trouve dans le
libraire Elmſly un conſeiller ſage, inſtruit et diſcret. * * *
Votre calcul de la dépenſe de la maiſon ſurpaſſe, non pas abſolument
mes moyens, mais un peu mes eſpérances et mes conjectures. La
conſummation en Suiſſe n'eſt point chargée d'impots; le vin y coule
comme l'eau de fontaine; votre jardin produit des fruits et des
légumes. Se peut il que vingt ou trente Louis ſe dépenſent tous les
mois pour le pain, la viande, le bois, la chandelle, quelque peu de
vin étranger, les domeſtiques de la cuiſine, &amp;c.? Je me flatte que
dans l'incertitude, vous avez cavé au plus fort; mais enfin tout ce
détail ſe réglera ſuivant nos goûts et nos facultés; et un mois d'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>périence
ſera plus inſtructif que cent pages de raiſonnemens. La
comparaiſon que vous me demandez de mon ménage de Londres, ne
meneroit à rien. À la riguerur je ne tiens pas maiſon; je ne donne
preſque jamais à manger: en hyver je dine aſſez rarement chez moi;
je ne ſoupe jamais; et une partie aſſez conſidérable de la dépenſe
(celle des clubs et des <hi>tavernes</hi>) n'entre point dans le compte de la
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:0112200701:618"/>
maiſon. Ma nourriture domeſtique n'excede pas toutefois votre
calcul Lauſannois; mais je ſens la différence entre le petit couvert
triſte et meſquin d'un garçon, et la table honnête et hoſpitalière de
deux amis, qui auront d'autres amis, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Votre idée de maſquer mes grands opérations eſt de la plus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonde
politique; mais les déclarations, et même les démarches qui
ſeront néceſſaires pour me retirer de la Chambre des Communes, dé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareront
un peu trop tot l'étendue de mes projets. Cependant on
peut tirer quelque parti de cette honnête diſſimulation, pour calmer
un peu les ſcrupules, et les regrets des dames agées que vous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſez,
et que vous ne connoiſſez pas. Mais le moyen le plus effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace
pour arrêter, ou pour ne pas écouter les mauvais diſcours, c'eſt
de s'y dérober par une prompte fuite, et depuis que ma réſolution a
été priſe, je compte les jours et les momens. Le 10 du mois prochain
je retournerai à Londres, où je travaillerai vivement à préparer ce
grand changement d'état. J'attends tous les jours la réponſe de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Gibbon, à qui j'ai tâché de perſuader qu'une entrevue de trois
ou quatre jours à Bath, ſeroit moins douce qu'amère à tous les deux.
Si elle ſe rend, ou fait ſemblant de ſe rendre à mes raiſons, je
compte que tout fini la première, ou du moins la ſeconde ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
de Septembre, et comme je couperai droit par la Champagne,
et la Franche-Comté, je pourrois fort bien me trouver à Lauſanne
vers le 20 ou le 25 de ce mois là, ſuppoſé toujours que cette prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
vous convienne, que votre maiſon ſera libre, et que vous y
ſerez rendu vous même. J'avois quelque idée de me détourner par
Straſbourg, de vous prendre à Baſle, et de paſſer avec vous par
Berne, &amp;c. mais, tout bien conſidéré, j'aime mieux abréger le grand
voyage et réſerver cette promenade (ſi nous avions envie de la faire)
pour une ſaiſon plus tranquille. J'attends votre réponſe dans une
trentaine de jours; mais ſans l'attendre je vous écrirai de Londres,
pour continuer le fil de l'hiſtoire, et peut être pour vous charger de
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:0112200701:619"/>
quelques achats de livres, qui ſe feront plus commodément à Baſle
qu'à Lauſanne. Vous ne me donnez point de commiſſions. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
ce pays n'eſt pas ſans induſtrie. Milord et Milady Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
vous embraſſent très amicalement. Ce ſera pour mois la perte
la plus ſenſible.</p>

more deeply than the kind concern of Lady Sheffield and the ſilent

were ſhipped for Rouen, and will reach Lauſanne almoſt as ſoon
as myſelf. On Thurſday morning the bulk of the library moves
from Bentinck-ſtreet to Downing-ſtreet. I ſhall eſcape from the

leave. I want to know your preciſe motions, what day you arrive

               <p>IL y long tems que je n'ai été auſſi mécontent de moi que je le ſuis
dans ce moment; j'ai fait par l'événement une grande étourderie;
j'ai manqué à ceux qui me quittent, et à celui qui vient me joindre;
enfin je me ſuis très mal conduit. M. * * *, qui loge chez moi,
me paroîſſoit ſi diſpoſé à quitter ma maiſon, quand je partis au printems,
que ne doutant pas qu'il ne trouvât à s'arranger pendant tout l'été,
je la regardois dejà d'avance comme vacante. Le plaiſir extrême
que j'avois à vous l'offrir, n'a pas peu contribué à ſoutenir cette il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion;
enſin n'entendant parler cependant de rien, je lui ai écrit,
après avoir reçu il y a ſix jours votre dernière, et il vient de me
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:0112200701:621"/>
répondre qu'il n'à rien trouvé encore, mais qu'il n'épargnera ni ſoins
ni dépenſes, pour déloger, je ne lui ai au reſte point marqué de quoi
il étoit queſtion; mais je l'ai prié de me dire à quelle époque il
croyoit que ma maiſon pourroit être vacante. Je lui récrirai demain,
car il me paraît qu'il eſt piqué, et tel que je le connois, malgré ce
que je pourrai lui marquer, il ſera fort empreſſé à décamper; mais
malgré cela, il ne faut plus compter ſur la maiſon entière pour votre
arrivée.</p>
               <p>Je vous demande mille pardons, mon cher ami, je me mets à
votre merci; et en vérité ſi vous me voyiez en ce moment, vous
auriez pitié de moi. Que nous reſte-t-il à faire? car enfin il ne faut
pas perdre la tête. J'ai un appartement de deux chambres ſans lit, et
deux petits cabinets, où vous pourriez être paſſablement, en attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
que la maiſon fût tout à fait libre; le tout eſt à plein pied de la
terraſſe, je me procurerois un logement au bout de mon jardin, et nous
pourrions nous faire apporter à manger, choſe pratiquée par nombre
de Grands Seigneurs, entr'autres par Monſeigneur le Margrave
d'Anſpach. 2. Ou bien louer un appartement garni que nous occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perons
enſemble. Ou enſin 3. paſſer l'hyver dans quelle autre ville
du Continent qu'il vous plaira choiſir, ou j'irai vous joindre et vous
porter mes excuſes. Une réflexion que je fais dans ce moment ci, et
qui me conſole un peu, c'eſt que dans votre première lettre, votre réſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
ne tenoit point à ma maiſon, ni même à l'idée de loger et vivre
avec moi. Ce ſecond article aura toujours lieu, s'il vous convient, et le
premier ne ſera que différé; ainſi appaiſez vous, mon cherami, pardonnez
moi, et écrivez moi tout de ſuite lequel de ces partis vous convient le
mieux, pour que je m'y conforme; ou ſi vous en imaginez un nouveau,
annoncez le moi. Une réflexion qui contribue encore à me conſoler,
c'eſt que pendant le tems que nous camperons ainſi en quelque manière,
nous aurons le tems de bien voir autour de nous, et de nous arranger
à notre aiſe, d'une manière ſtable et commode pour notre établiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Encore une fois cependant, mon cher ami, mille pardons.</p>

Milord Sheffield s'eſt montré plus raiſonnable que je ne l'aurais
cru; diantre! n'allez pas dire cela à ſa ſeigneurie; mais dites-lui, je
vous prie, combien me plait l'eſpoir d'avoir l'honneur de le con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre;
je vois encore d'ici ſon beau pare et le charmant ruiſſeau.
Son ſuffrage dans des circonſtances qui doivent ſans doute le prévenir
contre moi, me fait le plus grand plaiſir, parceque je le regarde comme
une bien forte preuve que vous prenez un parti convenable à votre
bonheur. Des commiſſions, je ne ſaurais trop que vous dire dans
ce moment; comme vous avez une maiſon montée, voyez s'il n'y

their ſelfiſh cunning, and your ſanguine unſuſpecting ſpirit. Not
dreaming of your arrival, I thought it unneceſſary to apprize you,
that I delayed Hampton to this day; on Monday I ſhall return, and
will expect you Tueſday evening, either in Bentinck or Downing-ſtreet,
as you like beſt. You have ſeen the piles of learning accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated
in your parlour; the tranſportation will be atchieved to-day,
and Bentinck-ſtreet is already reduced to a light, ignorant habitation,
which I ſhall inhabit till about the firſt of September; four days
muſt be allowed for clearing and packing; theſe I ſhall ſpend in
Downing-ſtreet, and after ſeeing you a moment on your return,
I ſhall ſtart about Saturday the ſixth. London is a deſert, and
life, without books, buſineſs, or ſociety, will be ſomewhat tedious.
From this ſtate, you will judge that your plan coincides very well,
only I think you ſhould give me the whole of Wedneſday in Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinck-ſtreet.
With regard to Buſhy, perhaps as a compliment to Lord
L. you had better defer it till your return. I admire Gregory Way,
and ſhould envy him, if I did not poſſeſs a diſpoſition ſomewhat

               <p>FOR the names of Sheffelina, &amp;c. are too playful for the ſerious

<pb n="603" facs="tcp:0112200701:624"/>
Lauſanne. I loſt ſight of our almoſt certain meeting at the end of
a term, which, at our age, cannot appear very diſtant; nor could I
amuſe my uneaſineſs with the hopes, the more doubtful proſpect, of
your viſit to Switzerland. The agitation of preparing every thing
for my departure has, in ſome degree, diverted theſe melancholy
thoughts; yet I ſtill look forwards to the deciſive day (to-morrow
ſe'nnight) with an anxiety of which yourſelf and Lord S. have the
principal ſhare.</p>
               <p>Surely never any thing was ſo unlucky as the unſeaſonable death of
Sir John Ruſſel on his paſſage to his friend at Sheffield-Place, which
ſo ſtrongly reminded us of the inſtability of human life and human
expectations. The inundation of the aſſizes muſt have diſtreſſed

               <p>SINCE my departure is near, and inevitable, you and Lady S. will
be rather ſorry than glad to hear that I am detained, day after
day, by the caprice of the winds. <hi>Three</hi> Flanders Mails are now
due. I know not how to move without the final letter from Dey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdun,
which I expected a fortnight ago, and my fancy (perfectly
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:0112200701:628"/>
unreaſonable) begins to create ſtrange phantoms. A ſtate of ſuſpence
is painful, but it will be alleviated by the ſhort notes which I mean to
write, and hope to receive, every poſt. A ſeparation has ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
though they are purchaſed with bitter pangs; among them
is the pleaſure of knowing how dear we are to our friends, and how
dear they are to us. It will be a kind office to ſooth aunt Kitty's
ſorrows, and "to rock the cradle of declining age." She will be
vexed to hear that I am not yet gone; but ſhe is reaſonable and
cheerful. Adieu. Moſt truly yours.</p>

this day, but without any letters from Deyverdun. Moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible!
After many adverſe reflections, I have finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
begin my journey on Monday; a heavy journey, with
much apprehenſion, and much regret. Yet I conſider, firſt, That
if he is alive and well, (an unpleaſant <hi>if,</hi>) ſcarcely any event can have
happened to diſappoint our mutual wiſhes; and, 2dly, That, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very worſt, even that worſt would not overthrow my general
plan of living abroad, though it would derange my hopes of a quiet
and delightful eſtabliſhment with my friend. Upon the whole,
without giving way to melancholy fears, my reaſon conjectures that
his indolence thought it ſuperfluous to write any more, that it was
my buſineſs to act and move, and his duty to ſit ſtill and receive me
with open arms. At leaſt he is well informed of my operations, as
I wrote to him (ſince his laſt) July thirty-firſt, from Sheffiield-Place;
Auguſt nineteenth; and this week, September ninth. The two firſt
have already reached him.</p>

As I ſhall not arrive ar, or depart from, Dover till Tueſday night,
(alas! I may be confined there a week,) you will have an opportunity,
by diſpatching a parcel <hi>per</hi> poſt to Elmſly's, to catch the Monday's
poſt. Let us improve theſe laſt ſhort moments: I want to hear
how poor Kitty behaves. I am really impatient to be gone. It is
provoking to be ſo near, yet ſo far from, certain perſons. London
is a deſert. I dine to-morrow with the Paynes, who paſs through.
Lord Loughborough was not returned from Buxton yeſterday. Sir
Henry Clinton found me out this morning: he talks with rapture of
viſits to be made at Sheffield, and returned at Brighton. I envy
him thoſe viſits more than the red ribbon. Adieu.</p>

               <p>I ARRIVED ſafe in harbour laſt Saturday, the 27th inſtant, about
ten o'clock in the morning; but as the poſt only goes out twice
a week, it was not in my power to write before this day. Except
one day, between Langres and Beſançon, which was laborious
enough, I finiſhed my eaſy and gentle airing without any fatigue,
either of mind or body. I found Deyverdum well and happy, but
much more happy at the ſight of a friend, and the accompliſhment
of a ſcheme which he had ſo long and impatiently deſired. His
garden, terrace, and <hi>park,</hi> have even exceeded the moſt ſanguine of
my expectations and remembrances; and you yourſelf cannot have
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:0112200701:632"/>
forgotten the charming proſpect of the lake, the mountains, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
of the Pays de Vaud. But as human life is perpetually chequered
with good and evil, I have found ſome diſappointments on my arrival.
The eaſy nature of Deyverdun, his indolence, and his impatience,
had promted him to reckon too poſitively that his houſe would be
vacant at Michaelmas; ſome unforeſeen difficulties have ariſen, or
have been diſcovered when it was already too late, and the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our hopes is (I am much afraid) poſtponed to next
ſpring. At firſt I was knocked down by the unexpected thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt,
but I have gradually been reconciled to my fate, and have
granted a free and gracious pardon to my friend. As his own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which afforded me a temporary ſhelter, is much too narrow
for a ſettled reſidence, we hired for the winter a convenient ready-furniſhed
apartment in the neareſt part of the Rue de Bourg, whoſe
back door leads in three ſteps to the terrace and garden, as often as
a tolerable day ſhall tempt us to enjoy their beauties; and this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement
has even its advantage, of giving us time to deliberate
and provide, before we enter on larger and more regular eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But this is not the ſum of my misfortunes; hear, and pity!
The day after my arrival (Sunday) we had juſt finiſhed a very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
dinner, and intended to begin a round of viſits on foot,
<hi>chapeau ſous le bras,</hi> when, moſt unfortunately, Deyverdun propoſed
to ſhew me ſomething in the court; we boldly and ſucceſsfully
aſcended a flight of ſtone ſteps, but in the deſcent I miſſed my foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſtrained, or ſprained, my ancle in a painful manner. My
old latent enemy, (I do not mean the Devil,) who is always on the
watch, has made an ungenerous uſe of his advantage, and I much
fear that my arrival at Lauſanne will be marked with a fit of the
gout, though it is quite unneceſſary that the intelligence or ſuſpicion
ſhould find its way to Bath. Yeſterday afternoon I lay, or at leaſt
ſat, in ſtate to receive viſits, and at the ſame moment my room was
filled with four different nations. The loudeſt of theſe nations
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:0112200701:633"/>
was the ſingle voice of the Abbé Raynal, who, like your friend,
has choſen this place for the aſylum of freedom and hiſtory. His
converſation, which might be very agreeable, is intolerably loud,
peremptory, and inſolent; and you would imagine that he alone
was the monarch and legiſlator of the world. Adieu. I embrace
my Lady, and the infants. With regard to the important tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for which you are conſtituted plenipotentiary, I expect with
ſome impatience, but with perfect confidence, the reſult of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
You may remember what I mentioned of my converſation
with * * * about the place of Miniſter at Bern: I have
talked it over with Deyverdun, who does not diſlike the idea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
this place was allowed to be my villa, during at leaſt two-thirds
of the year; but for my part, I am ſure that * * * are
worth more than miniſterial friendſhip and gratitude; ſo I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to think, that they are preferable to an office which would be
procured with difficulty, enjoyed with conſtraint and expence, and
loſt, perhaps, next April, in the annual revolutions of our domeſtic
Government. Again adieu.</p>

               <p>THE progreſs of my gout is in general ſo regular, and there is
ſo much uniformity in the Hiſtory of its Decline and Fall, that
I have hitherto indulged my lazineſs, without much ſhame or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe,
without ſuppoſing that you would be very anxious for my
ſafety, which has been ſufficiently provided for by the triple care of
my friend Deyverdun, my humbler friend Caplin, and a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable
phyſician, (not the famous Tiſſot,) whoſe ordinary fee is ten
batz, about fifteen pence Engliſh. After the uſual increaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:0112200701:634"/>
of the member (for it has been confined to the injured part)
the gout has retired in good order, and the remains of weakneſs,
which obliged me to move on the rugged pavement of Lauſanne
with a ſtick, or rather ſmall crutch, are to be aſcribed to the ſprain,
which might have been a much more ſerious buſineſs. As I have
now ſpent a month at Lauſanne, you will enquire with much cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
more kindneſs, and ſome mixture of ſpite and malignity,
how far the place has anſwered my expectations, and whether I do
not repent of reſolution which has appeared ſo raſh and ridiculous
to my ambitious friends? To this queſtion, however natural and
reaſonable, I ſhall not return an immediate anſwer, for two reaſons:
1. <hi>I have not yet made a fair trial.</hi> The diſappointment and delay with
regard to Deyverdun's houſe, will conſine us this winter to lodgings,
rather convenient than ſpacious or pleaſant. I am only beginning
to recover my ſtength and liberty, and to look about on perſons and
things; the greateſt part of thoſe perſons are in the country taken
up with their vintage; my books are not yet arrived, and, in ſhort,
I cannot look upon myſelf as ſettled in that comfortable way which
you and I underſtand and reliſh. Yet the weather has been hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
and till this time, the end of October, we enjoy the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the fun, and ſomewhat gently complain of its immoderate
heat. 2. If I ſhould be too ſanguine in explaining my ſatisfaction
in what I have done, you would aſcribe that ſatisfaction to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
of the ſcene, and the inconſtancy of man; and I deem it far
more ſafe and prudent to poſtpone any poſitive declaration, till I am
placed by experience beyond the danger of repentance and recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Yet of one thing I am ſure, that I poſſeſs in this country, as
well as in England, the beſt cordial of life, a ſincere, tender, and
ſenſible friend, adorned with the moſt valuable and pleaſant qualities
both of the heart and head. The inferiour enjoyments of leiſure
and ſociety are likewiſe in my power; and in the ſhort excurſions
which I have hitherto made, I have commenced or renewed my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:0112200701:635"/>
with a certain number of perſons, more eſpecially wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
(who, at leaſt in France and this country, are undoubtedly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to our prouder ſex,) of rational minds and elegant manners.
I breakfaſt alone, and have declared that I receive no viſits in a
morning, which you will eaſily ſuppoſe is devoted to ſtudy. I find
it impoſſible, without inconvenience, to defer my dinner beyond two
o'clock. We have got a very good woman cook. Deyverdun,
who is ſomewhat of an Epicurean philoſopher, underſtands the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of a table, and we frequently invite a gueſt or two to
ſhare our luxurious, but not extravagant repaſts. The afternoons
are (and will be much more ſo hereafter) devoted to ſociety, and I
ſhall ſind it neceſſary to play at cards much oftener than in London:
but I do not diſlike that way of paſſing a couple of hours, and I
ſhall not be ruined at ſhilling whiſt. As yet I have not ſupped, but
in the courſe of the winter I muſt ſometimes ſacrifice an evening
abroad, and in exchange I hope ſometimes to ſteal a day at home,
without going into company * * *.
I have all this time been talking to Lord Sheffield; I hope that he has
diſpatched my affairs, and it would give me pleaſure to hear that I
am no longer member for Lymington, nor Lord of <hi>Lenborough.</hi>
Adieu. I feel every day that the diſtance only to make me
think with more tenderneſs of the perſons whom I love.</p>

               <p>LAST Tueſday, November eleventh, after plaguing and vexing
yourſelf all the morning, about ſome buſineſs of your fertile

<pb n="615" facs="tcp:0112200701:636"/>
the evening, and perhaps the night, without ſleep or food,
ſtifled in a cloſe room by the heated reſpiration of ſix hundred po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians,
inflamed by party and paſſion, and tired of the repetition
of dull nonſenſe, which, in that illuſtrious aſſembly, ſo far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs
the proportion of reaſon and eloquence. On the ſame day,
after a ſtudious morning, a friendly dinner, and a cheerful aſſembly
of both ſexes, I retired to reſt at eleven o'clock, ſatisfied with the
paſt day, and certain that the next would afford me the return of the
ſame quiet and rational enjoyments. <hi>Which has the better bargain?</hi>
Seriouſly, I am every hour more grateful to my own judgment and
reſolution, and only regret that I ſo long delayed the execution of
a favourite plan, which I am convinced is the beſt adapted to my
character an inclinations. You conjecture of the revolutions of
my face, when I heard that the houſe was for this winter inaceſſible,
is probable, but falſe. I bore my diſappointment with the temper of
a ſage, and only uſe it to render the proſpect of next year ſtill more
pleaſing to my imagination. You are likewiſe miſtaken, in imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my fall to the awkwardneſs of my limbs. The ſame accident
might have happened to Slingſby himſelf, or to any <hi>hero</hi> of the age;
the moſt diſtinguiſhed for his <hi>bodily activity.</hi> I have now reſumed
my entire ſtrength, and walk with caution, yet with ſpeed and
ſafety, through the ſtreets of this mountainous city. After a month
of the fineſt autumn I ever ſaw, the <hi>biſe</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The North Eaſt wind.</note> made me feel my old
acquaintance; the weather is now milder, and this preſent day is
dark and rainy, not much better than what you probably enjoy in
England. The town is comparatively empty, but the Nobleſſe are
returning every day from their chateaux, and I already perceive that
I ſhall more reaſon to complain to complain of diſſipation than of dulneſs,
As I told Lady S. I am afraid of being too raſh and haſty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
my ſatisfaction; but I muſt again repeat, that appearances
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:0112200701:637"/>
are extremely favourable. I am ſenſible that general praiſe conveys
no diſtinct ideas, but it is very difficult to enter into particulars
where the individuals are unknown, or indifferent to our corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent.
You have forgotten the <hi>old</hi> generation, and in twenty years
a new one is grown up. Death has ſwept many from the world,
and chance or choice has brought many to this place. If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after your old acquaintance Catherine, you muſt be told, that
ſhe is ſolitary, ugly, blind, and univerſally forgotten. Your later
flame, and our common goddeſs, the Eliza, paſſed a month at the
inn. She came to conſult Tiſſot, and was acquainted with Cerjat.
And now to buſineſs. * * *
With regard to meaner caſes, theſe are two, which you can and
will undertake. 1. As I have not renounced my country, I ſhould
be glad to hear of your parliamentary ſquabbles, which may be
done with ſmall trouble and expence. After an intereſting debate,
my Lady in due time may cut the ſpeeches from Woodfall. You
will write or dictate any curious anecdote, and the whole, incloſed
in a letter, may be diſpatched to Lauſanne. 2. A ſet of Wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
china, which we talked of in London, and which would be
moſt acceptable here. As you have a <hi>ſort</hi> of a taſte, I leave to
your own choice the colour and the pattern; but as I have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
and means to live very handſomely <hi>here,</hi> I deſire that the
ſize and number of things may be adequate to a plentiful table. If
you ſee Lord North, aſſure him of my gratitude; had he been a
more ſucceſsful friend, I ſhould now be drudging at the Board of
Cuſtoms, or vexed with buſineſs in the amiable ſociety of—.
To Lord Loughborough preſent an affectionate ſentiment; I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of his intention to ſerve me, if I had not been in ſuch a
fidget. I am ſure you will not fail, while you are in town, to viſit
and comfort poor aunt Kitty. I wrote to her on my firſt arrival,
and ſhe may be aſſured that I will not neglect her. To my Lady I
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:0112200701:638"/>
ſay nothing; we have now our private correſpondence, into which
the eye of an huſband ſhould not be permitted to intrude. I am
really ſatisfied with the ſucceſs of the pamphlet<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations on the Commerce with the American States.</note>; not only becauſe
I have a ſneaking kindneſs for the author, but as it ſhews me that
plain ſenſe, full information, and warm ſpirit, are ſtill acceptable in
the world. You talk of Lauſanne as a place of retirement, yet,
from the ſituation and freedom of the Pays de Vaud, all nations,
and all extraordinary characters, are aſtoniſhed to meet each other.
The Abbé Raynal, the grand Gibbon, and Mercier, author of the
<hi>Tableau de Paris,</hi> have been in the ſame room. The other day the
Prince and Princeſs de Ligne, the Duke and Ducheſs d'Urſel, &amp;c.
came from Bruſſels on purpoſe (literally true) to act a comedy at

appear; but we had comedy, ball, and ſupper. The event ſeems to
have revived him; for that great man is fallen from his ancient
glory, and his neareſt relations refuſe to ſee him. I told you of
poor Catherine's deplorable ſtate; but Madame de Meſery, at the age
of ſixty-nine, is ſtill handſome. Adieu.</p>

<pb n="618" facs="tcp:0112200701:639"/>
houſe, to which, without regret, I bid an everlaſting farewel. The
agreeable hour of five o'clock in the morning, at which you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
retire, does not tend to revive my attachment; but if you add
the ſoft hours of your morning Committee<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſelect Committee for inquiring into frauds committed in reſpect to the revenue.</note>, in the diſcuſſion of taxes,
cuſtoms, frauds, ſmugglers, &amp;c. I think I ſhould beg to be releaſed
and quietly ſent to the gallies, as a place of leiſure and freedom.
Yet I do not depart from my general principles of toleration. Some
animals are made to live in the water, others on the earth, many in
the air, and ſome, as it is now believed, even in fire. Your preſent
hurry of Parliament I perfectly underſtand; when oppoſition make
the attack,
<q>
                     <l>—Horae</l>
                     <l>Momento cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta.</l>
                  </q>
But when the Miniſter brings forward any ſtrong and deciſive mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the at length prevails; but his progreſs is retarded at every ſtep,
and in every ſtage of the bill, by a pertinacious, though unſucceſsful,
minority. I am not ſorry to hear of the ſplendour of Fox; I am
proud, in a foreign country, of his fame and abilities, and our little
animoſities are extinguiſhed by my retreat from the Engliſh ſtage.
With regard to the ſubſtance of the buſineſs, I ſcarcely know what
to think: the vices of the Company<note n="†" place="bottom">Eaſt India Company.</note>, both in their perſons and their
conſtitution, were manifold and manifeſt; the danger was imminent,
and ſuch an empire, with thirty millions of ſubjects, was not to be
loſt for trifles. Yet, on the other hand, the faith of charters, the
rights of property! I heſitate and tremble. Such an innovation
would at leaſt require that the remedy ſhould be as certain as the
evil, and the proprietors may perhaps inſinuate, that <hi>they</hi> were as
competent guardians of their own affairs, as either * * *
or * * *. Their acting without a ſalary, ſeems
childiſh, and their not being removable by the Crown, is a ſtrange
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:0112200701:640"/>
and dangerous precedent. But enough of politics, which I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to view through a thin, cold, diſtant cloud, yet not without a
reaſonable degree of curioſity and patriotiſm. From the papers
(eſpecially when you add an occaſional ſlice of the Chronicle) I ſhall
be amply informed of facts and debates. From you I expect the
cauſes, rather than the events, the true ſprings of action, and thoſe
intereſting ancedotes which ſeldom aſcend the garret of a Fleet-ſtreet
editor. You ſay that many friends (alias acquaintance) have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
curioſity and concern; I ſhould not wiſh to be immediately
forgotten. That others (you once mentioned Gerard Hamilton) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
Government, for ſuffering the departure of a man who might
have done them ſome credit and ſome ſervice, perhaps as much as
* * * himſelf. To you, in the confidence of friendſhip,
and without either pride or reſentment, I will fairly own that I am
ſomewhat of Gerards's opinion; and if I did not compare it with
the reſt of his character, I ſhould be aſtoniſhed that * * *
ſuffered me to depart, without even a civil anſwer to my letter.
Were I capable of hating a man, whom it is not eaſy to hate, I ſhould
ſind myſelf amply revenged by * * *. But the happy ſouls in
Paradiſe are ſuſceptible only of love and pity, and though Lauſanne is
not a Paradiſe, more eſpecially in winter, I do aſſure you, in ſober
profe, that it has hitherto fulfilled, and even ſurpaſſed, my warmeſt
expectation. Yet I often caſt a look toward Sheffield-Place, where
you now repoſe, if you can repoſe, during the Chriſtmas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
Embrace my Lady, the young Baroneſs, and the gentle
Louiſa, and inſinuate to your ſilent Conſort, that ſeparate letters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſeparate anſwers. Had I an air balloon, the great topic of
modern converſation, I would call upon you till the meeting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

                  <salute>DEAR MADAM</salute> 
               </opener>
               <p>THE unfortunate are loud and loquacious in their complaints, but
real happineſs is content with its own ſilent enjoyment; and if
that happineſs is of a quiet uniform kind, we ſuffer days and weeks
to elapſe without communicating our ſenſations to a diſtant friend.
By you, therefore, whoſe temper and underſtanding have extracted
from human life on every occaſion the beſt and moſt comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
my ſilence will always be interpreted as an evidence of
content, and you would only be alarmed (the danger is not at
hand) by the too frequent repetition of my letters. Perhaps I
ſhould have continued to ſlumber, I don't know how long, had I
not been awakened by the anxiety which you expreſs in your laſt
letter. * * *</p>
               <p>From this baſe ſubject I aſcend to one which more ſeriouſly and
ſtrongly engages your thoughts, the conſideration of my health
and happineſs. And you will give me credit when I aſſure you
with ſincerity, that I have not repented a ſingle moment of the ſtep
which I have taken, and that I only regret the not having executed
the ſame deſign two, or five, or even ten years ago. By this time
I might have returned independant and rich to my native country;
I ſhould have eſcaped many diſagreeable events that have happened
in the meanwhile, and I ſhould have avoided the parliamentary life,
which experience has proved to be neither ſuitable to my temper, nor
conducive to my fortune. In ſpeaking of the happineſs which I
enjoy, you will agree with me, in giving the preference to a ſincere
and ſenſible friend; and though you cannot diſcern the full extent
of his merit, you will eaſily believe that Deyverdun is the man.
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:0112200701:642"/>
Perhaps two perſons ſo perfectly fitted to live togethe, were never
ormed by Nature and education. We have both read and ſeen a
great variety of objects; the lights and ſhades of our different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
are happily blended, and a friendſhip of thirty years has
taught us to enjoy our mutual advantages, and to ſupport our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
imperfections. In love and marriage, ſome harſh ſounds
will ſometimes interrupt the harmony, and in the courſe of time,
like our neighbours, we muſt expect ſome diſagreeable moments;
but confidence and freedom are the two pillars of our union, and I
am much miſtaken, if the building be not ſolid and comfortable.
One diſappointment I have indeed experienced, and patiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
The family who were ſettled in Deyverdun's houſe ſtarted
ſome unexpected difficulties, and will not leave it till the ſpring; ſo
that you muſt not yet expect any poetical, or even hiſtorical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the beauties of my habitation. During the dull months
of winter we are ſatisfied with a very comfortable apartment in the
middle of the town, and even derive ſome advantage from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
as it gives us time to arrange ſome plans of alteration and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
which will embelliſh our future and more elegant dwelling.
In this ſeaſon I riſe (not at four in the morning) but a little before
eight; at nine, I am called from my ſtudy to breakfaſt, which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
perform alone, in the Engliſh ſtile, and, with the aid of
Caplin, I perceive no difference between Lauſanne and Bentinck-ſtreet.
Our mornings are uſually paſſed in ſeparate ſtudies; we
never approach each other's door without a previous meſſage, or
thrice knocking, and my apartment is already ſacred and formidable
to ſtrangers. I dreſs at half paſt one, and at two (an early hour, to
which I am not perfectly reconciled,) we ſit down to dinner. We have
hired a female cook, well-ſkilled in her profeſſion, and accuſtomed to
the taſte of every nation; as for inſtance, we had excellent mince-pies
yeſterday. After dinner, and the departure of our company, one
two, or three friends, we read together ſome amuſing book, or
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:0112200701:643"/>
play at cheſs, or retire to our rooms, or make viſits, or go to the
coffee-houſe. Between ſix and ſeven the aſſemblies begin, and I am
oppreſſed only with their number and variety. Whiſt, at ſhillings
or half-crowns, is the game I generally play, and I play three rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
with pleaſure. Between nine and ten we withdraw to our bread
and cheefe, and friendly converſe, which ſends us to bed at eleven;
but theſe ſober hours are too often interrupted by private or nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſuppers, which I have not the courage to reſiſt, though I practiſe
a laudable abſtinence at the beſt furniſhed tables. Such is the ſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton
of my life; it is impoſſible to communicate a perfect idea of
the vital and ſubſtantial parts, the characters of the men and women
with whom I have very eaſily connected myſelf in looſer and cloſer
bonds, according to their inclination and my own. If I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
myſelf and if Deyverdun does not flatter me, I am already a
general favourite; and as our likings and diſlikes are commonly
mutual, I am equally ſatisfied with the freedom and elegance of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and (after proper allowances and exceptions) with the worthy
and amiable qualities of many individuals. The autumn has been
beautiful, and the winter hitherto mild, but in January we muſt
expect ſome ſevere froſt. Inſtead of rollings in a coach, I walk the
ſtreets, wrapped up in a fur cloak; but this exerciſe is wholeſome,
and except an accidental fit of the gout of a few days, I never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
better health. I am no longer in Pavillard's houſe, where I
was almoſt ſtarved with cold and hunger, and you may be aſſured
that I now enjoy every benefit of comfort, plenty, and even decent
luxury. You wiſh me happy; acknowledge that ſuch a life is more
conducive to happineſs, than five nights in the week paſſed in the
Houſe of Commons, or five mornings ſpent at the Cuſtom-houſe.
Send me, in return, a fair account of your own ſituation in mind
and body. I am ſatisfied your own good ſenſe would have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
you to inevitable ſeparation; but there never was a more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
diverſion than your viſit to Sheffield-Place. Among the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:0112200701:644"/>
proofs of friendſhip which I have received from that family,
there are none which affect me more ſenſibly than their kind civilities
to you, though I am perſuaded that they are at leaſt as much on
your account as on mine. At length Madame de * * *
is delivered by her tyrant's death; her daughter, a valuable woman
of this place, has made ſome enquiries, and though her own cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are narrow, ſhe will not ſuffer her father's widow to be
left totally deſtitute. I am glad you derived ſo much melancholy
pleaſure from the letters, yet had I known it, I ſhould have withheld

               <p>WITHIN two or three days after your laſt <hi>gracious</hi> epiſtle, your
complaints were ſilenced, and your enquiries were ſatisfied,
by an ample diſpatch of four pages, which overflowed the inſide of
the cover, and in which I expoſed my opinions of things in general,
public as well as private, as they exiſted in my mind, in my ſtate
of ignorance and error, about the eighteenth or twentieth of laſt
month. Within a week after that date I epiſtoliſhed, in the ſame rich
and copious ſtrain, the two venerable females of Newman-ſtreet and
Bath, whoſe murmurings muſt now be changed into ſongs of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and applauſe. My correſpondence with the holy matron of
Northamptonſhire has been leſs lively and loquacious. You have
not forgotten the author's vindication of himſelf from the foul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of pretended Chriſtians. Within a fortnight after his arrival
at Lauſanne, he communicated the joyful event to Mrs. Eſther Gibbon.
She anſwered, <hi>per</hi> return of poſt, both letters at the ſame time, and
in very dutiful language, almoſt excuſing her advice, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:0112200701:645"/>
for my ſpiritual, as well as temporal good, and aſſuring me,
that <hi>nobody ſhould be able to injure me with her.</hi> Unleſs the ſaint is
an hypocrite, ſuch an expreſſion muſt convey a favourable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
meaning. At all events, it is worth giving <hi>ourſelves</hi> ſome
trouble about her, without indulging any ſanguine expectations of
inheritance. So much for my females; with regard to my male
correſpondents, you are the only one to whom I have given any
ſigns of my exiſtence, though I have formed many a generous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
Yet I am not inſenſible of the kind and friendly manner in
which Lord Loughborough has diſtinguiſhed me. He could have
no inducements of intereſt, and now that I veiw the diſtant picture
with impartial eyes, I am convinced that (for a ſtateſman) he was
ſincere in his wiſhes to ſerve me. When you ſee <hi>him,</hi> the Paynes,
Eden, Crauford, &amp;c. tell them that I am well, happy, and aſhamed.
On your ſide, the zeal and diligence of your pen has ſurpriſed and
delighted me, and your letters, at this intereſting moment, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
ſuch as I wiſhed them to be—authentic anecdotes, and rational
ſpeculations, worthy of a man who acts a part in the great theatre,
and who fills a ſeat, not only in the general Pandaemonium, but in
the private council of the princes of the infernal regions. With
regard to the detail of parliamentary operations, I muſt repeat my
requeſt to you, or rather to my Lady, who will now be on the ſpot,
that ſhe will write, not with her pen, but with her ſciſſars, and that
after every debate which deſerves to paſs the ſea and mountains,
ſhe will diſſect the faithful narrative of Woodfall, and ſend it off by
the next poſt, as an agreeable ſupplement to the meagre accounts of
our weekly papers. The wonderful revolutions of laſt month have
ſounded to my ear more like the ſhifting ſcenes of a comedy, or
comic-opera, than like the ſober events of real and modern hiſtory;
and the irregularity of our winter poſts, which ſometimes retarded,
and ſometimes haſtened, the arrival of the diſpatches, has increaſed
the confuſion of our ideas. Surely the Lord has blinded the eyes
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:0112200701:646"/>
of Pharoah and of his ſervants; the obſtinacy of laſt ſpring was
nothings compared to the headſtrong and headlong madneſs of this
winter. I expect with much impatience the firſt days of your
meeting; the purity and integrity of the coalition will ſuffer a fiery
trial; but if they are true to themſelves and to each other, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
of the Houſe of Commons muſt prevail; the rebellion of the
young gentlemen will be cruſhed, and the maſters will reſume the
government of the ſchool. After the addreſs and anſwer, I have
no conception that Parliament can be diſſolved during the ſeſſion;
but if the preſent Miniſtry can outlive the ſtorm, I think the death-warrant
will infallibly be ſigned in the ſummer. <hi>Here</hi> I bluſh for
my country, without confeſſing her ſhame. Fox acted like a man
of honour, yet ſurely his union with Pitt affords the only hope of
ſalvation. How miſerably are we waſting the ſeaſon of peace!</p>
               <p>I have written three pages before I come to my own buſineſs and
feelings. In the firſt place, I moſt ſincerely rejoice that I left the
ſhip, and ſwam aſhore on a plank: the daily and hourly agitation
in which I muſt have lived would have made me truly miſerable;
and if I had obtained a place during pleaſure, * * *, for
inſtance? On the firſt news of the diſſolution, I conſidered my ſeat
as ſo totally and irrecoverably gone, that I have been leſs afflicted
with * * *'s obſtinacy. * * *
On this occaſion remember you are acting for a <hi>poor</hi> friend; diſmiſs
a little of the ſpirit of faction and patriotiſm, and ſtoop to a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
line of conduct, which in your own caſe you might poſſibly
diſdain. * * *
Perhaps you will abuſe my prudence and patriotiſm, when I inform
you, that I have already veſted a part (thirty thouſand livres, about
one thouſand three hundred puunds) in the new loan of the King of
France. I get eight <hi>per cent.</hi> on the joint lives of Deyverdun and
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:0112200701:647"/>
myſelf, beſides thirty tickets in a very advantageous lottery, of which
the higheſt prize is an annuity of forty thouſand livres (one thouſand
ſeven hundred pounds) a year. At this moment, the beginning of
a peace, and probably a long peace, I think (and the world ſeems
to think) the French funds at leaſt as ſolid as our own, I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
my agent, M. de Leſſart, a capital banker at Paris, to draw
upon Goſling for the money two months hence; and to avoid all
accidents that may reſult from untoward delays, and mercantile
churliſhneſs, I expect that you will ſupport my credit in Fleet-ſtreet
with you own more reſpectable name. * * *
What ſay you now? Am I not a wiſe man? My letter is enormous,
and the poſt on the wing. In a few days I will write to my Lady
herſelf, and enter ſomething more into the details of domeſtic life.
Suffice it to ſay, that the ſcene becomes each day more pleaſant
and comfortable, and that I complain only of the diſſipation of
Lauſanne. In the courſe of March or April we ſhall take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of Deyverdun's houſe. My books, which, by ſome ſtrange
neglect, did not leave Paris till the third of this month, will arrive
in a few weeks; and I ſhall ſoon reſume the continuation of my
Hiſtory, which I ſhall proſecute with the more vigour, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
affords me a diſtant proſpect of a viſit to England. Adieu.
Ever yours.</p>

               <p>AFTER my laſt enormous diſpatch, nothing can remain, except
ſome ſmall gleanings, or occaſional hints; and thus in order:
I am not conſcious that any of your valuable MSS. have miſcarried,
or that I have omitted to anſwer any eſſential particulars. They
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:0112200701:648"/>
ſtand in my bureau carefully arranged, and docketed under the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
dates; September twenty-three, October twenty-three, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
eighteen, December two, December fifteen, December nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
December twenty-three, December twenty-nine, January ſixteen,
which laſt I have received this day, February 2d. For greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity,
it will not be amiſs (on either ſide) to number our future
epiſtles, by a conſpicuous Roman character inſcribed in the front, to
which we may at any time refer. But inſtead of writing by Oſtend,
the ſhorter and ſurer way, eſpecially on all occaſions that deſerve cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
will be to incloſe them to my banker, M. de Leſſart at Paris, who
will forward them to me. Through Germany the paſſage by ſea is
more uncertain, the roads worſe, and the diſtance greater: we
often complain of delay and irregularity at this intereſting moment.
By your laſt I find that you have boldly and generouſly opened a
treaty with the enemy, which I propoſed with fear and heſitation.
I impatiently expect the reſult; and again repeat, that <hi>whatever</hi> you
can obtain for * * *, I ſhall conſider it as ſo much ſaved
out of the fire, &amp;c. &amp;c. Do you remember Dunning's motion (in
the year 1780) to addreſs the Crown againſt a diſſolution of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
a ſimple addreſs we rejected, as an infringement on the
prerogative? yet how far ſhort of theſe ſtrong democratical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
for which you have probably voted, as I ſhould probably have
done: ſuch is the contagion of party. Fox drives moſt furiouſly,
yet I ſhould not be ſurpriſed if Pitt's moderation and character
ſhould inſenſibly win the nation, and even the Houſe, to eſpouſe
his cauſe. * * *
Unleſs when I look back on England with a ſelfiſh or a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
my hours roll away very pleaſantly, and I can again repeat
with truth, that I have not regretted one ſingle moment the ſtep
which I have taken. We are now at the height of the winter
diſſipation, and I am peculiarly happy when I can ſteal away from
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:0112200701:649"/>
great aſſemblies, and ſuppers of twenty or thirty people, to a more
private party of ſome of thoſe perſons whom I begin to call my
friends. Till we are ſettled in our houſe little can be expected on
our ſide; yet I have already given two or three handſome dinners;
and though every thing is grown dearer, I am not alarmed at the
general view of my expence. Deyverdun ſalutes you; and we are
agreed that few married couples are better entitled to the flitch of
bacon than we ſhall be at the end of the year. When I had written
about half this epiſtle my books arrived: at our firſt meeting all was
rapture and confuſion, and two or three poſts, from the ſecond to
this day, the fourteenth, have been ſuffered to depart unnoticed.
Your letter of the twenty-ſeventh of January, which was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

had exiſted; and every day I congratulate my own good fortune,
let me ſay my prudence and reſolution, in migrating from your noiſy
ſtage to a ſcene of repoſe and content. But even in this ſeparate
ſtate, I was ſtill anxious for my friend upon Engliſh earth, and at
firſt was much delighted with your hint, that you were ſetting off
for Coventry, without any proſpect of an oppoſition. Every poſt,
Wedneſdays and Saturdays, I eagerly looked for the intelligence of
your victory; and in ſpite of my miſbehaviour, which I do not
deny, I muſt abuſe <hi>my Lady,</hi> rather than you, for leaving me in ſo
painful a ſituation. Each day raiſed and increaſed my apprehenſion;
the <hi>Courier de l' Europe</hi> firſt announced the conteſt, the Engliſh papers
proclaimed your defeat, and your laſt letter, which I received four
days ago, ſhewed me that you exerted firſt the ſpirit, and at laſt the
temper of an hero. I am not much ſurpriſed that you ſhould have
been ſwept away in the general unpopularity, ſince even in this
quiet place, your friends are conſidered as a factious crew, acting in
direct oppoſition both to the King and people. For yourſelf I am
at a loſs what to ſay. If this repulſe ſhould teach you to renounce
all connection with Kings and Miniſters, and Patriots and Parties,
and Parliaments; for all of which you are by many degrees too
honeſt; I ſhould exclaim, with Teague of reſpectable memory,
<q>By my ſhoul, dear joy, you have <hi>gained</hi> a loſs.</q> Private life,
whether contemplative or active, has ſurely more ſolid and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
charms; you have <hi>ſome</hi> domeſtic comforts; Sheffield-Place
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:0112200701:651"/>
is ſtill ſuſceptible of uſeful and ornamental improvements, (alas!
how much better might even the laſt * * * have been laid out!)
and if theſe cares are not ſufficient to occupy your leiſure, I can
truſt your reſtleſs and enterpriſing ſpirit to find new methods to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
you from the inſipidity of repoſe. But I much fear your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
and regret at being excluded from that Pandaemonium which
we have ſo often curſed, as long as you were obliged to attend it.
The leaders of the party will flatter you with the opinion of their
friendſhip and your own importance; the warmith of your temper
makes you credulous and unſuſpicious; and, like the reſt of our
ſpecies, male and female, you are not abſolutely deaf to the voice of
praiſe. Some other place will be ſuggeſted, eaſy, honourable, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
where nothing is wanted but a man of character and ſpirit to
head a ſuperior intereſt; the oppoſition, if any, is contemptible, and
the expence cannot be large. You will go down, find almoſt every
circumſtance falſely ſtated, repent that you had engaged yourſelf,
but you cannot deſert thoſe friends who are firmly attached to your
cauſe; beſides, the money you have already ſpent would have been
thrown away; another thouſand will complete the buſineſs: deeper
and deeper will you plunge, and the laſt evil will be worſe than the
firſt. You ſee I am a free-ſpoken counſellor; may I not be a true
prophet! Did I conſult my own wiſhes, I ſhould obſerve to you,
that as you are no longer a ſlave, you might ſoon be tranſported, as
you ſeem to deſire, to one of the Alpine hills. The purity and
calmneſs of the air is the beſt calculated to allay the heat of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
fever; the education of the two Princeſſes might be ſucceſsfully
conducted under your eye and that of my Lady; and if you had
reſolution to determine on a reſidence, not a viſit, at Lauſanne, your
worldly affairs might repoſe themſelves after their late fatigues. But
you know that <hi>I</hi> am a friend to toleration, and am always diſpoſed to
make the largeſt allowance for the different natures of animals; a lion
and a lamb, an eagle and a worm. I am afraid we are too quiet for
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:0112200701:652"/>
you; here it would not be eaſy for you to create any buſineſs; you
have for ſome time neglected books, and I doubt whether you would
not think our ſuppers and aſſemblies ſomewhat trifling and inſipid.
You are far more difficult than I am; you are in ſearch of knowledge,
and you are not content with your company, unleſs you can derive
from them information or extraordinary amuſement. For my part,
I like to draw information from books, and I am ſatisfied with
polite attention and eaſy manners. Finally, I am happy to tell, and
you will be happy to hear, that this place has in every reſpect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
my beſt and moſt ſanguine hopes. How often have you
ſaid, as often as I expreſſed any ill-humour againſt the hurry, the
expence, and the precarious condition of my London life, <q>Ay,
that is a nonſenſical ſcheme of retiring to Lauſanne that you have
got into your head, a pretty fancy; you remember how much you
liked it in your youth, but you have now ſeen more of the world,
and if you were to try it again, you would find yourſelf woefully
diſappointed?</q> I had it in my head, in my heart, I have tried it,
I have not been diſappointed, and my knowledge of the world has
ſerved only to convince me, that a capital and a crowd may contain
much leſs real ſociety, than the ſmall circle of this gentle retirement.
The winter has been longer, but, as far as I can learn, leſs rigorous
than in the reſt of Europe. The ſpring is now burſting upon us,
and in our own garden it is diſplayed in all its glory. I already oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
a temporary apartment, and we live in the lower part of the
houſe; before you receive this we ſhall be in full poſſeſſion. We
have much to enjoy and ſomething to do, which I take to be the
happieſt condition of human life. Now for buſineſs, the kind of
ſubject which I always undertake with the moſt reluctance, and leave
with the moſt pleaſure. * * *
Adieu.</p>

                  <pb n="632" facs="tcp:0112200701:653"/>
And now, my Lady,</p>
               <p>LET me approach your gentle, not grimalkin, preſence, with
deep remorſe. You have indirectly been informed of my ſtate of
mind and body; (the whole winter I have not had the ſlighteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the gout, or any other complaint whatſoever;) you have
been appriſed, and are now appriſed, of my motions, or rather of
my perfect and agreeable repoſe; yet I muſt confeſs (and I <hi>feel</hi>)
that ſomething of a direct and perſonal exchange of ſentiment has
been neglected on my ſide, though I ſtill <hi>perſuade</hi> myſelf that when
I am ſettled in my new houſe I ſhall have more ſubject, as well
as leiſure, to write. Such tricks of lazineſs your active ſpirit is
a ſtranger to, though Mrs. * * * complains that ſhe has never
had an anſwer to her laſt letters. Poor Lady Pembroke! <hi>you</hi> will
feel for her; after a cruel alternative of hope and fear, her only
daughter, Lady Charlotte, died at <hi>Aix en Provence;</hi> they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
her to come to this place, where ſhe is intimately connected
with the Cerjat family. She has taken an agreeable houſe, about
three miles from the town, and lives retired. I have ſeen her; her
behaviour is calm, but her affliction—. I accept with gratitude
your friendly propoſal of Wedgewood's ware, and ſhould be glad to
have it bought and packed, and ſent without delay through Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;
and I ſhall only ſay, that I wiſh to have a very complete
ſervice for two courſes and a deſert, and that our ſuppers are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
frequently fifteen or twenty perſons. Adieu. I do not
mean this as your letter. You are very good to poor Kitty. With

                  <salute>DEAR MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I BEGIN without preface or apology, as if I had received your
letter by the laſt poſt. In my own defence I know not what to
ſay; but if I were diſpoſed to recriminate, I might obſerve that you
yourſelf are not perfectly free from the ſin of lazineſs and procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
I have often wondered why we are not fonder of letter-writing.
We all delight to talk of ourſelves, and it is only in letters,
in writing to a friend, that we can enjoy that converſation, not only
without reproach or interruption, but with the higheſt propriety
and mutual ſatisfaction; ſure that the perſon whom we addreſs feels
an equal, or at leaſt a ſtrong and lively intereſt in the conſideration
of the pleaſing ſubject. On the ſubject therefore of <hi>ſelf</hi> I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
a friend, to whom none of my thoughts or actions, none of
my pains or pleaſures, can ever be indifferent. When I firſt che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
the deſign of retiring to Lauſanne, I was much more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of wounding your tender attachment, than of offending
Lord Sheffield's manly and vehement friendſhip. In the abolition
of the Board of Trade the motives for my retreat became more
urgent and forcible; I wiſhed to break looſe, yet I delayed above a
year before I could take my final reſolution; and the letter in which
I diſcloſed it to you coſt me one of the moſt painful ſtruggles of my
life. As ſoon as I had conquered that difficulty, all meaner obſtacles
fell before me, and in a few weeks I found myſelf at Lauſanne,
aſtoniſhed at my firmneſs and my ſucceſs. Perhaps you ſtill blame
or ſtill lament the ſtep which I have taken. If on your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I can only ſympathize with your feelings, the recollection
of which often coſts me a ſigh: if on mine, let me fairly ſtate what
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:0112200701:655"/>
I have eſcaped in England, and what I have found at Lauſanne.
Recollect the tempeſts of this winter, how many anxious days I
ſhould have paſſed, how many noiſy, turbulent, hot, unwholeſome
nights, while my political exiſtence, and that of my friends, was at
ſtake; yet theſe feeble efforts would have been unavailing; I ſhould
have loſt my ſeat in parliament, and after the extraordinary expence of
another year, I muſt ſtill have purſued the road of Switzerland, unleſs
I had been tempted by ſome ſelfiſh patron, or by Lord S.'s aſpiring
ſpirit, to incur a moſt inconvenient expence for a new ſeat; and
once more, at the beginning of an oppoſition, to engage in new
ſcenes of buſineſs. As to the immediate proſpect of any thing like
a quiet and profitable retreat, I ſhould not know where to look; my
friends are no longer in power. With * * * and his party I
have no connection; and were he diſpoſed to favour a man of
letters, it is difficult to ſay what he could give, or what I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
the reign of penſions and ſinecures is at an end, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in the Exciſe or Cuſtoms, the ſummit of my hopes, would
give me income at the expence of leiſure and liberty. When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
theſe circumſtances in my mind, my only regret, I repeat it
again and again, is, that I did not embrace this ſalutary meaſure
three, five, ten years ago. Thus much I thought it neceſſary to
ſay, and ſhall now diſmiſs this unpleaſing part of the ſubject.
For my ſituation here, health is the firſt conſideration; and on that
head your tenderneſs had conceived ſome degree of anxiety. I
know not whether it has reached you that I had a ſit of the gout
the day after my arrival. The deed is true, but the cauſe was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental;
careleſsly ſtepping down a flight of ſtairs, I ſprained my
ancle; and my ungenerous enemy inſtantly took advantage of my
weakneſs. But ſince my breaking that double chain, I have enjoyed
a winter of the moſt perfect health that I have perhaps ever known,
without any mixture of the little flying incommodities which in my
beſt days have ſometimes diſturbed the tranquillity of my Engliſh
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:0112200701:656"/>
life. You are not ignorant of Dr. Tiſſot's reputation, and his merit
is even above his reputation. He aſſures me, that in his opinion, the
moiſture of England and Holland is moſt pernicious; the dry pure
air of Switzerland moſt favourable to a gouty conſtitution: that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
juſtifies the theory; and that there are fewer martyrs of that
diſorder in this, than in any other country in Europe. This winter
has every where been moſt uncommonly ſevere: and you ſeem in
England to have had your full ſhare of the general hardſhip: but in
this corner, ſurrounded by the Alps, it has rather been long than
rigorous; and its duration ſtole away our ſpring, and left us no
interval between furs and ſilks. We now enjoy the genial influence
of the climate and the ſeaſon; and no ſtation was ever more calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to enjoy them than Deyverdun's houſe and garden, which are
now become my own. You will not expect that the pen ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

                  </gap>king on a paved court, twelve feet ſquare, I command
a boundles proſpect of vale, mountain, and water, from my three
windows. My apartment is completed by a ſpacious light cloſet, or
ſtore-room, with a bed-chamber and dreſſing-room. Deyverdun's
habitation is pleaſant and convenient, though leſs extenſive: for our
common uſe we have a very handſome winter apartment of four
rooms; and on the ground-floor, two cool ſaloons for the ſummer,
with a ſufficiency, or rather ſuperfluity, of offices, &amp;c. A terrace,
one hundred yards long, extends beyond the front of the houſe, and
leads to a cloſe impenetrable ſhrubbery; and from thence the circuit
of a long and various walk carries me round a meadow and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.
The intervals afford abundant ſupply of fruit, and every ſort
of vegetables; and if you add, that this villa (which has been much
ornamented by my friend) touches the beſt and moſt ſociable part of
the town, you will agree with me, that few perſons, either princes
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:0112200701:657"/>
or philoſophers, enjoy a more deſirable reſidence. Deyverdun,
who is proud of his own works, often walks me round, pointing out,
with acknowledgment and enthuſiaſm, the beauties that change with
every ſtep and with every variation of light. I ſhare, or at leaſt I ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize
with his pleaſure. He appears contented with my progreſs,
and has already told ſeveral people, that he does not deſpair of making
me a gardener. Be that as it may, you will be glad to hear that I am,
by my own choice, infinitely more in motion, and in the open air,
than I ever have been formerly; yet my perfect liberty and leiſure
leave me many ſtudious hours; and as the circle of our acquaintance
retire into the country, I ſhall be much leſs engaged in company and
diverſion. I have ſeriouſly reſumed the proſecution of my Hiſtory;
each day and each month adds ſomething to the completion of the
great work. The progreſs is ſlow, the labour continual, and the
end remote and uncertain; yet every day brings its amuſement, as
well as labour; and though I dare not fix a term, even in my own
fancy, I advance, with the pleaſing reflection, that the buſineſs of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
(ſhould I be detained here ſo long) muſt enforce my return
to England, and reſtore me to the beſt of mothers and friends. In
the mean while, with health and competence, a full independence of
mind and action, a delightful habitation, a true friend, and many
pleaſant acquaintance; you will allow, that I am rather an object of
envy than of pity; and if you were more converſant with the uſe of the
French language, I would ſeriouſly propoſe to you to repoſe yourſelf
with us in this fine country. My indirect intelligence (on which
I ſometimes depend with more implicit faith than on the kind diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of your friendſhip) gives me reaſon to hope that the laſt winter
has been more favourable to your health than the preceding one.
Aſſure me of it yourſelf honeſtly and truly, and you will afford me
one of the moſt lively pleaſures.</p>

               <p>SINCE my retreat to Lauſanne our correſpondence has never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo long an interruption; and as I have been equally taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
with the reſt of the Engliſh world, it may now be a problem
among that ſceptical nation, whether the Hiſtorian of the Decline

is the ſleepy power of lazineſs and habit, that the ſilence of each

<pb n="638" facs="tcp:0112200701:659"/>

letter, compel me to remember that you are entruſted with the final
amputation of the beſt limb of my property. The ſubject is in
itſelf ſo painful, that I have poſtponed it, like a child's phyſic, from
day to day; and loſing whole mornings, as I walked about my
library, in uſeleſs regret and impotent reſolution, you will be amazed
to hear that (after peeping to ſee if you are all well, and returned
from Ireland) I have not yet had the courage to peruſe your letter,
for fear of meeting with ſome gloomy intelligence; and I will now
finiſh what I have to ſay of pecuniary matters, before I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
its contents will fortify or overthrow my unbiaſſed ſentiments.
* * *
To what purpoſe (will you ſay) are theſe
tardy and uſeleſs repinings? To arraign your manager? No, I am
ſatisfied with the ſkill and firmneſs of the pilot, and complain only
of the untoward violence of the tempeſt. To repent of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
into Switzerland? No, ſurely, every ſubſequent event has
tended to make it as neceſſary as it has proved agreeable. Why
then theſe lamentations? Hear and attend—It is to intereſt (if
poſſible more ſtrongly) your zeal and friendſhip, to juſtify a ſort of
avarice, a love of money, very ſoreign to my character, but with
which I cling to theſe laſt fragments of my fortune. * * *
As far as I can judge from the experience of a year, though I find
Lauſanne much more expenſive than I imagined, yet my ſtile of
living (and a very handſome ſtile it is) will be brought <hi>nearly</hi> within
my ordinary revenues. I wiſh our poor country could ſay as much!
But it was always my favourite and rational wiſh, that at the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of my affairs I might poſſeſs a ſum, from one to two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds, neither buried in land, nor locked up in the funds, but
free, light, and ready to obey any call of intereſt, or pleaſure, or
virtue; to defray any extraordinary expence, ſupport any delay, or
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:0112200701:660"/>
remove any obſtacle. For the attainment of this object, I truſt in
your aſſiſtance. * * *
Thus much for this
money tranſaction; to you I need add no other ſtimulative, than
to ſay that my eaſe and comfort very much depend on the ſucceſs of
this plan.</p>
               <p>As I thought every man of ſenſe and fortune in Ireland muſt be

               <p>A FEW weeks ago, as I was walking on our terrace with M. Tiſſot,
the celebrated phyſician; M. Mercier, the author of the <hi>Tableau
de Paris;</hi> the Abbé Raynal; Monſieur, Madame, and Mademoiſelle
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:0112200701:661"/>
Necker; the Abbé de Bourbon, a natural ſon of Lewis the Fifteenth,
the Hereditary Prince of Brunſwick, Prince Henry of Pruſſia, and a
dozen Counts, Barons, and extraordinary perſons, among whom was
a natural ſon of the Empreſs of Ruſſia—Are you ſatisfied with this
lift? which I could enlarge and embelliſh, without departing from
truth; and was not the Baron of Sheffield (profound as he is on
the ſubject of the American trade) doubly miſtaken with regard to
Gibbon and Lauſanne? Whenever I uſed to hint my deſign of retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that illuſtrious Baron, after a proper effuſion of d—d fools,
condeſcended to obſerve, that ſuch an obſcure nook in Switzerland
might pleaſe me in the ignorance of youth, but that after taſting for
ſo many years the various ſociety of Paris and London, I ſhould
ſoon be tired with the dull and uniform round of a provincial town.
In the winter, Lauſanne is indeed reduced to its native powers; but
during the ſummer, it is poſſibly, after Spa, one of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
places of general reſort. The tour of Switzerland, the Alps,
and the Glaciers, is become a faſhion. Tiſſot attracts the invalids,
eſpecially from France; and a colony of Engliſh have taken up the
habit of ſpending their winters at Nice, and their ſummers in the
Pays de Vaud. Such are the ſplendour and variety of our ſummer
viſitors; and <hi>you</hi> will agree with me more readily than the Baron,
when I ſay that this variety, inſtead of being a merit, is, in my
opinion, one of the very few objections to the reſidence of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanne.
After the diſſipation of the winter I expected to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
with more freedom and ſolitude, myſelf, my friend, my
books, and this delicious paradiſe; but my poſition and character
make me here a ſort of a public character, and oblige me to ſee and
be ſeen. However, it is my firm reſolution for next ſummer to
aſſume the independence of a philoſopher, and to be viſible only to the
perſons whom I like. On the principle I ſhould not, moſt aſſuredly,
have avoided the Neckers and Prince Henry. The former have
purchaſed the barony of Copet near Geneva; and as the buildings
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:0112200701:662"/>
were very much out of repair, they paſſed this ſummer at a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
at the gates of Lauſanne. They afford a new example, that
perſons who have taſted of greatneſs can ſeldom return with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to a private ſtation. In the moments when we were alone he
converſed with me freely, and I believe truly, on the ſubject of his
adminiſtration and fall; and has opened ſeveral paſſages of modern
hiſtory, which would make a very good figure in <hi>the</hi> American
book<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervation on the Commerce with the American States.</note> If they ſpent the ſummers at the caſtle of Copet, about
nine leagues from hence, a fortnight or three weeks viſit would be a
pleaſant and healthful excurſion; but, alas! I fear there is little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of its being executed. <hi>Her</hi> health is impaired by the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of her mind: inſtead of returning to Paris, ſhe is ordered to
paſs the winter in the ſouthern provinces of France, and our laſt
parting was ſolemn; as I very much doubt whether I ſhall ever
ſee her again. They have now a very troubleſome charge, which
you will exeprience in a few years, the diſpoſal of a Baroneſs; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle<note n="†" place="bottom">Now Madame de Staal.</note>
Necker, one of the greateſt heireſſes in Europe, is now
about eighteen, wild, vain, but good-natured, and with a much larger
proviſion of wit than of beauty: what increaſes their difficulties is
their religious obſtinacy of marrying her only to a proteſtant. It
would be an excellent opportunity for a young Engliſhman of a great
name and a fair reputation. Prince Henry muſt be a man of ſenſe;
for he took more notice, and expreſſed more eſteem for me, than
any body elſe. He is certainly (without touching his military
character) a very lively and entertaining companion. He talked
with freedom, and generally with contempt, of moſt of the princes
of Europe; with reſpect of the Empreſs of Ruſſia, but never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
the name of his brother, except once, when he hinted that
it was <hi>he himſelf</hi> that won the battle of Roſbach. His nephew, and
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:0112200701:663"/>
our nephew, the hereditary Prince of Brunſwick is here for his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Of the Engliſh, who live very much as a national colony,
you will like to hear of Mrs. Fraſer and <hi>one</hi> more. Donna Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian<note n="*" place="bottom">The Honourable Mrs. Fraſer.</note>
pleaſes every body, by the perfect ſimplicity of her ſtate of
nature. You know ſhe has had reſolution to return from England
(where ſhe told me ſhe ſaw you) to Lauſanne, for the ſake of Miſs
Briſtow, who is in bad health, and in a few days they ſet off for
Nice. <hi>The other</hi> is the Eliza; ſhe paſſed through Lauſanne, in her
road from Italy to England; poorly in health, but ſtill adorable,
(nay, do not frown!) and I enjoyed ſome delightful hours by her
bed-ſide. She wrote me a line from Paris, but has not executed her
promiſe of viſiting Lauſanne in the month of October. My pen
has run much faſter, and much farther, than I intended on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of other; yet, in deſcribing them, I have thrown ſome light
over myſelf and my ſituation. A year, a very ſhort one, has now
clapſed ſince my arrival at Lauſanne; and after a cool review of my
ſentiments, I can ſincerely declare, that I have never, during a ſingle
moment, repented of having executed my <hi>obſurd</hi> project of retiring to
Lauſanne. It is needleſs to dwell on the fatigue, the hurry, the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I muſt have felt in the narrow and dirty circle of Engliſh
politics. My preſent life wants no foil, and ſhines by its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
light. The choſen part of my library is now arrived, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged
in a room full as good as that in Bentinck-ſtreet, with this
difference indeed, that inſtead of looking on a ſtone court, twelve
feet ſquare, I command, from three windows of plate-glaſs, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
proſpect of many a league of vineyard, of fields, of wood,
of lake, and of mountains; a ſcene which Lord Sheffield will tell
you is ſuperior to all you can imagine. The climate, though ſevere
in winter, has perfectly agreed with my conſtitution, and the year
is accompliſhed without any return of the gout. An excellent
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:0112200701:664"/>
houſe, a good table, a pleaſant garden, are no contemptible ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
in human happineſs. The general ſtyle of ſociety hits my
ſancy; I have cultivated a large and agrecable circle of acquaintance,
and I am much deceived if I have not laid the foundations of two
or three more intimate and valuable connections; but their names
would be indifferent, and it would require pages, or rather volumes,
to deſcribe their perſons and characters. With regard to my ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſh, my domeſtic friend, I could not be much diſappointed,
after an intimacy of eight-and-twenty years. His heart and his
head are excellent; he has the warmeſt attachment for me, he is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that I have the ſame for him: ſome ſlight imperfections muſt be
mutually ſupported; two bachelors, who have lived ſo long alone and
independent, have their peculiar fancies and humours, and when the
maſk of form and ceremony is laid aſide, every moment in a family-life
has not the ſweetneſs of the honey-moon, even between the
huſbands and wives who have the trueſt and moſt tender regard for
each other. Should you be very much ſurpriſed to hear of my
being married? Amazing as it may ſeem, I do aſſure you that the
event is leſs improbable than it would have appeared to myſelf a
twelvemonth ago. Deyverdun and I have often agreed, in jeſt and
in earneſt, that a houſe like ours would be regulated, and graced,
and enlivened, by an agreeable female companion; but each of us
ſeems deſirous that his friend ſhould ſacrifice himſelf for the public
good. Since my reſidence here I have lived much in women's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and, to your credit be it ſpoken, I like you the better the
more I ſee of you. Not that I am in love with any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I have diſcovered about half-a-dozen <hi>wives</hi> who would pleaſe
me in different ways, and by various merits: one as a miſtreſs (a
widow, vaſtly like <hi>the</hi> Eliza; if ſhe returns I am to bring them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether);
a ſecond, a lively entertaining acquaintance; a third, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
good-natured friend; a fourth, who would repreſent with grace
and dignity at the head of my table and family; a fifth, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:0112200701:665"/>
oeconomiſt and houſekeeper; and a ſixth, a very uſeful nurſe.
Could I find all theſe qualities united in a ſingle perſon, I ſhould dare
to make my addreſſes, and ſhould deſerve to be refuſed. You hint in
ſome of your letters, or rather poſtſcripts, that you conſider me as
having renounced England, and having ſixed myſelf for the reſt of
my life in Switzerland, and that you ſuſpect the ſincerity of my
vague or inſidious ſchemes of purchaſe or return. To remove, as
far as I can, your doubts and ſuſpicions, I will tell you, on that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
ſubject, fairly and ſimply as much as I know of my own
intentions. There is little appearance that I ſhall be ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
by the offer of a place or penſion. I have no claim to the
friendſhip of your young miniſter, and ſhould he propoſe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner
of the Cuſtoms, or Secretary at Paris, the ſuppoſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of my low ambition, Adam in Paradiſe would refuſe them with
contempt. <hi>Here</hi> therefore I ſhall certainly live till I have finiſhed
the remainder of my Hiſtory; an arduous work, which does not
proceed ſo faſt as I expected, amidſt the avocations of ſociety, and
miſcellaneous ſtudy. As ſoon as it is completed, moſt probably in
three or <hi>four</hi> years, I ſhall infallibly return to England, about the
month of May or June; and the neceſſary labour of printing with
care two or three quarto volumes, will detain me till their publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in the enſuing ſpring. Lord Sheffield and yourſelf will be
the loadſtone that moſt forcibly attracts me; and as I ſhall be a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond
on the face of the earth, I ſhall be the better qualified to
domeſticate myſelf with you, both in town and country. Here
then, at no very extravagant diſtance, we have the certainty (if we
live) of ſpending a year together, in the peace and freedom of a
friendly intercourſe; and a year is no very contemptible portion of
this mortal exiſtence. Beyond that period all is dark, but not
gloomy. Whether, after the final completion of my Hiſtory, I
ſhall return to Lauſanne, or ſettle in England, muſt depend on a
thouſand events which lie beyond the reach of human foreſight, the
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:0112200701:666"/>
ſtate of public and private affairs, my own health, the health and
life of Deyverdun, the various changes which may have rendered
Lauſanne more dear, or leſs agreeable, to me than at preſent. But
without loſing ourſelves in this diſtant futurity, which perhaps we
may never ſee, and without giving any poſitive anſwer to Maria's
parting queſtion, whether I ſhall be buried in England or Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
let me ſeriouſly and earneſtly aſk you, whether you do not
mean to viſit me next ſummer? The defeat at Coventry would, I
ſhould think, facilitate the project; ſince the Baron is no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the whole winter from his domeſtic affairs, nor is there any
attendance on the Houſe that keeps him till Midſummer in duſt and
diſpute. I can ſend you a pleaſant route, through Normandy, Paris,
and Lyons, a viſit to the Glaciers, and your return down the Rhine,
which would be commodiouſly executed in three or four months, at
no very extravagant expence, and would be productive of health
and ſpirits to you, of entertainment to you both, and of inſtruction
to <hi>the</hi> Maria. Without the ſmalleſt inconvenience to myſelf, I am
able to lodge yourſelves and family, by arranging you in the winter
apartment, which in the ſummer ſeaſon is not of any uſe to us. I
think you will be ſatisfied with your habitation, and already ſee you
in your dreſſing-room; a ſmall pleaſant room, with a delightful
proſpect to the weſt and ſouth. If poor aunt Kitty (you oblige me
beyond expreſſion by your tender care of that excellent woman) if
ſhe were only ten years younger, I would deſire you to take her
with you, but I much fear we ſhall never meet again. You will
not complain of the brevity of this epiſtle; I expect, in return, a
full and fair account of yourſelf, your thoughts and actions, ſoul
and body, preſent and future, in the ſafe, though unreſerved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of friendſhip. The Baron in two words hinted but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
account of your health; you are a fine machine; but as he
was abſent in Ireland, I hope I underſtand the cauſe and the remedy.
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:0112200701:667"/>
Next to yourſelf, I want to hear of the two Baroneſſes. You muſt
give me a faithful picture (and though a mother you can give it)
of their preſent external and internal forms; for a year has now
elapſed, and in <hi>their</hi> lives a year is an age. Adieu. Ever yours.</p>

               <p>MY long ſilence (and it has been long) muſt not, on this occaſion,
be imputed to lazineſs, though that little devil may likewiſe

more than a fortnight ſince your laſt letter, and that of Goſling
informed me of the event. I have intended every day to write, and
every day I have ſtarted back with reluctance and diſguſt, from the
conſideration of the wretched ſubject. Lenborough irrecoverably
gone, for three-fourths of its real, at leaſt of its ancient, value; my
ſeat in parliament ſunk in the abyſs of your curſed politics, and a
balance neatly cyphered and ſummed by Goſling, which ſhews me
a very ſhallow purſe, in which others have a clearer right to dip

                  <p>Another week is now elapſed, and though nothing is changed in
this too faithful ſtate of my affairs, I feel myſelf able to encounter
them with more ſpirit and reſolution; to look on the future, rather
than the paſt, on the fair, rather than on the foul ſide of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
I ſhall ſpeak in the confidence of friendſhip, and while you
liſten to the more doleful tale of my wants and wiſhes, you will
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:0112200701:668"/>
have the ſatisfaction of hearing ſome circumſtances in my preſent
ſituation of a leſs unpleaſing nature. 1. In the firſt place, I moſt
heartily rejoice in the ſale, however unfavourable, of the Bucks
eſtate. Conſidering the dullneſs of the times, and the high intereſt
of money, it is not a little to obtain even a tolerable price, and I am
ſenſible how much your patience and induſtry have been exerciſed
to extort the payment. 2. Your reſiſtance to my Swiſs expedition
was more friendly than wiſe. Had I yielded, after eighteen months
of ſuſpence and anxiety, I ſhould now, a ſtill poorer man, be driven
to embrace the ſame reſource, which has ſucceeded according to, or
even beyond, my moſt ſanguine expectations. I do not pretend to
have diſcovered the terreſtrial paradiſe, which has not been known
in this world ſince the fall of Adam; but I can truly declare, (now
the charms of novelty are long ſince faded,) that I have found the
plan of life the beſt adapted to my temper and my ſituation. I am
now writing to you in a room as good as that in Bentinck-ſtreet,
which commands the country, the lake, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the opening proſpect of the ſpring. The aforeſaid
room is furniſhed without magnificence, but with every conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
for warmth, eaſe, and ſtudy, and the walls are already
covered with more than two thouſand volumes, the choice of a
choſen library. I have health, friends, an amuſing ſociety, and
perfect freedom. A Commiſſioner of the Exciſe! the idea makes me
ſick. If you aſk me what I have ſaved by my retreat to Lauſanne?
I will fairly tell you (in the two great articles of a carriage and a
houſe in town, both which were indiſpenſable, and are now anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated,
with the difference of clubs, public places, ſervants wages,
&amp;c.) about four hundred pounds, or guineas, a year; no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſum, when it muſt be annually found as addition to an expence
which is ſomewhat larger than my preſent revenue. 3. <hi>What is then,
you will aſk, my preſent-eſtabliſhment? This</hi> is not by any means a
cheap country; and, except in the article of wine, I could give a
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:0112200701:669"/>
dinner, or make a coat, perhaps for the ſame price in London as at
Lauſanne. My chief advantage ariſes from the things which I do
not want; and in ſome reſpects my ſtyle of living is enlarged by the
increaſe of my relative importance, an obſcure bachelor in England,
the maſter of a conſiderable houſe at Lauſanne. Here I am expected
to return entertainments, to receive ladies, &amp;c. and to perform
many duties of ſociety, which, though agreeable enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
contribute to inflame the houſekeeper's bills. From the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements
of the firſt year I cannot form any juſt eſtimate; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
expences of the journey, carriage of heavy goods from
England, the acquiſition of many books, which it was not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to tranſport, the purchaſe of furniture, wine, fitting up my
library, and the irregularity of a new menage, have conſumed a
pretty large ſum. But in a quiet, prudent, regular courſe of life, I
think I can ſupport, myſelf with comfort and honour for ſix or ſeven
hundred pounds a year, inſtead of a thouſand or eleven hundred in
England.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe uncertainties, (uncertain at leaſt as to the time,) I
have a ſure and honourable ſupply from my own pen. I continue
my Hiſtory with pleaſure and aſſiduity; the way is long and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
yet I ſee the end, and I can almoſt promiſe to land in England
next September twelvemonth, with a manuſcript of the current
value of about four thouſand pounds, which will afford either a
ſmall income or a large capital. 5. It is in the meanwhile that my
ſituation is ſomewhat difficult. * * *
Such are the ſervices and revenues of the year; proceed we now, in
the ſtyle of the budget, to the ways and means of extraordinary
ſupplies. * * *
I will not affront your friendſhip,
by obſerving that you will incur little or no riſk on this occaſion.
Read, conſider, act, and write.</p>

It is the privilege of friendſhip to make our friend a patient hearer,
and active aſſociate in our own affairs; and I have now written five
pages on my private affairs, without ſaying a word either of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
or of yourſelf. Of the public I have little to ſay; I never was a
very warm patriot, and I grow every day a citizen of the world. The
ſcramble for power or profit at Weſtminſter or St. James's, and the
names of Pitt and Fox, become leſs intereſting to me than thoſe of Caeſar
and Pompey. You are not a friend of the young Miniſter, but he
is a great favourite on the continent, as he appears to be ſtill; and you
muſt own that the fairneſs of his character, his eloquence, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to buſineſs, and even his youth, muſt prepoſſeſs at leaſt the
ignorant in his favour. Of the merit or defects of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I cannot pretend to ſpeak; but I find, from the complaints of
ſome intereſted perſons, that his reſtraints on the ſmuggling of tea
have already ruined the Eaſt India Companies of Antwerp and
Sweden, and that even the Dutch will ſcarcely find it worth their
while to ſend any ſhips to China. Your Iriſh friends appear to be
more quiet, at leaſt the volunteers and national congreſs ſeem to
ſubſide. How far that tranquillity muſt be purchaſed on our ſide,
by any pernicious ſacrifices, you will beſt decide; and from ſome
hint in your laſt letters, I am inclined to think that you are leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
than might be ſuppoſed with national or local prejudice.
Your introduction I have attentively read; the matter, though moſt
important in itſelf, is out of the line of my ſtudies and habits, and
the ſubordinate beauties of ſtyle you diſclaim. Yet I can ſay with
truth, that I never met with more curious and diligent inveſtigation,
more ſtrong ſenſe, more liberal ſpirit, and more cool and impartial
temper in the ſame number of pages. By this time you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
read Necker's book on the finances. Perhaps for you there is
too much French enthuſiaſm and paint; but in many reſpects you
muſt have gained a knowledge of his country; and on the whole,
you muſt have been pleaſed with the picture of a great and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:0112200701:671"/>
mind. In your attack on Deyverdun for my picture I cannot
promiſe you much ſucceſs; he ſeems reſolved to maintain his right
of poſſeſſion, and your only chance would be a perſonal aſſault. The
next ſummer (how time ſlips away!) was fixed for your viſit to
Lauſanne. We are prepared at all points to receive <hi>you,</hi> my Lady,
and a princeſs or two, with their train; and if you have a proper
contempt for St. Stephen's chapel, you are perfectly free, and at
leiſure (can you ever be at leiſure?) for the ſummer ſeaſon. As
you are now in a great meaſure diſengaged from any affairs, you
may find time to inform me of your proceedings and your projects.
At preſent I do not even know whether you paſs the winter at Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-Place
or in Downing-ſtreet. My Lady revenges herſelf of my
long ſilence; yet I embrace her and the infants. Adieu. You
have deranged the Decline and Fall this morning. I have finiſhed
my epiſtle ſince dinner, and am now going to a pleaſant party and
good ſupper.</p>

               <p>EXTRACT from a weekly Engliſh Paper, September 5th, 1785.
<q>It is reported, but we hope without foundation, that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Mr. Gibbon, who had retired to Lauſanne in Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to finiſh his valuable Hiſtory, lately died in that city.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The hope of the Newſpaper-writer is very handſome and obliging
to the Hiſtorian; yet there are ſeveral weighty reaſons which would
incline me to believe that the intelligence may be true. <hi>Primo,</hi> It
muſt one day be true; and therefore may very probably be ſo at
preſent. <hi>Secundo,</hi> We may always depend on the impartiality, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy,
and veracity of an Engliſh Newſpaper. <hi>Tertio,</hi> which is
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:0112200701:672"/>
indeed the ſtrongeſt argument, We are credibly informed that for a
long time paſt the ſaid celebrated Hiſtorian has not written to any
of his friends in England; and as that reſpectable perſonage had
always the reputation of a moſt exact and regular correſpondent, it
may be fairly concluded from his ſilence, that he either is, or ought
to be dead. The only objection that I can foreſee, is the aſſurance
that Mr. G—himſelf read the article as he was eating his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
and laughed very heartily at the miſtake of his brother Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
but as he might be deſirous of concealing that unpleaſant
event, we ſhall not inſiſt on his apparent health and ſpirits, which
might be affected by that ſubtle politician. He affirms, however,
not only that he is alive, and was ſo on the fifth of September, but
that his head, his heart, his ſtomach, are in the moſt perfect ſtate,
and that the climate of Lauſanne has been congenial both to his mind
and body. He confeſſes indeed, that after the laſt ſevere winter, the
gout, his old enemy, from whom he hoped to have eſcaped, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
him to his retreat among the mountains of Helvetia, and that
the ſiege was long, though more languid than in his precedent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks;
after ſome exerciſe of patience he began to creep, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
to walk; and though he can neither run, nor fly, nor dance,
he ſupports himſelf with firmneſs on his two legs, and would will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
kick the impertinent Gazetteer; impertinent enough, though
more eaſily to be forgiven than the inſolent <hi>Courier du Bas Rhin,</hi>
who about three years ago amuſed himſelf and his readers with a
fictitious epiſtle from Mr. Gibbon to Dr. Robertſon.</p>
               <p>Perhaps now you think, Baron, that I ſhall apologize in humble
ſtyle for my ſilence and neglect. But, on the contrary, I do
aſſure you that I am truly provoked at your Lordſhip's not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to be in a paſſion. I might really have been dead, I might
have been ſick; if I were neither dead nor ſick, I deſerved a volley of
curſes and reproaches for my infernal lazineſs, and you have deſrauded
me of my juſt dues. Had I been ſilent till Chriſtmas, till doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:0112200701:673"/>
you would never have thought it worth your while to abuſe
me. Why then (let me aſk in your name) did you not write be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
That is indeed a very curious queſtion of natural and moral
philoſophy. Certainly I am not lazy; elaborate quartos have proved,
and will abundantly prove my diligence. I <hi>can</hi> write; ſpare my
modeſty on that ſubject. I like to converſe with my friends by pen
or tongue, and as ſoon as I can ſet myſelf a going, I know no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that run off more pleaſantly. I am ſo well convinced of that
truth, ſo much aſhamed of forcing people that I love to forget
me, that I have now reſolved to ſet apart the firſt hour of each
day for the diſcharge of my obligations; beginning, <hi>comme de raiſon,</hi>
with yourſelf, and regularly proceeding to Lord Loughborough and
the reſt. May Heaven give me ſtrength and grace to accompliſh
this laudable intention! Amen. Certainly (yet I do not know
whether it be ſo certain) I ſhould write much oftener to you if we
were not linked in buſineſs, and if my buſineſs had not always been
of the unpleaſant and mortifying kind. Even now I ſhove the ugly
monſter to the end of this epiſtle, and will confine him to a page by
himſelf, that he may not infect the purer air of our correſpondence.
Of my ſituation here I have little new to ſay, except a very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and ſingular truth, that my paſſion for my wife or miſtreſs (Fanny
Lauſanne) is not palled by ſatiety and poſſeſſion of two years. I
have ſeen her in all ſeaſons, and in all humours, and though ſhe is
not without faults, they are infinitely overbalanced by her good
qualities. Her face is not handſome, but her perſon, and every
thing about her, has admirable grace and beauty: ſhe is of a very
cheerful ſociable temper; without much learning, ſhe is endowed
with taſte and good ſenſe; and though not rich, the ſimplicity of
her education makes her a very good oeconomiſt; ſhe is forbid by
her parents to wear any expenſive finery; and though her limbs are
not much calculated for walking, ſhe has not yet aſked me to keep
her a coach. Laſt ſpring (not to wear the metaphor to rags) I ſaw
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:0112200701:674"/>
Lauſanne in a new light, during my long fit of the gout, and muſt
boldly declare, that either in health or ſickneſs I find it far more
comfortable than your huge metropolis. In London my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was ſad and ſolitary; the many forgot my exiſtence when they
ſaw me no longer at Brookes's; and the few, who ſometimes caſt a
thought or an eye on their friend, were detained by buſineſs or
pleaſure, the diſtance of the way, or the hours of the Houſe of
Commons, and I was proud and happy if I could prevail on Elmſly
to enliven the dulneſs of the evening. Here the objects are nearer,
and much more diſtinct, and I myſelf am an object of much larger
magnitude. People are not kinder, but they are more idle, and it
muſt be confeſſed that, of all nations on the globe, the Engliſh are
the leaſt attentive to the old and infirm; I do not mean in acts of
charity, but in the offices of civil life. During three months I have
had round my chair a ſucceſſion of agreeable men and women, who
came with a ſmile, and vaniſhed at a nod; and as ſoon as it was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
I had a conſtant party at cards, which was ſometimes diſmiſſed
to their reſpective homes, and ſometimes detained by Dyverdun to
ſupper, without the leaſt trouble or inconvenience to myſelf. In a
word, my plan has moſt completely anſwered; and I ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
after two years trial, that I have never in a ſingle moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of my tranſmigration. The only diſagreeable circumſtance
is the increaſe of a race of animals with which this country has been
long infeſted, and who are ſaid to come from an iſland in the
Northern Ocean. I am told, but it ſeems incredible, that upwards
of forty thouſand Engliſh, maſters and ſervants, are now abſent on
the continent; and I am ſure we have our full proportion, both in
town and country, from the month of June to that of October.
The occupations of the cloſet, indifferent health, want of horſes,
in ſome meaſure plead my excuſe; yet I do too much to pleaſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and probably too little to ſatisfy my countrymen. What is ſtill
more unlucky is, that a part of the colony of this preſent year are
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:0112200701:675"/>
really good company, people one knows, &amp;c.; the Aſtons, Hales,
Hampdens, Trevors, Lady Clarges and Miſs Carter, Lord North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,
&amp;c. I have ſeen Trevor ſeveral times, who talks of you, and
ſeems to be a more exact correſpondent than myſelf. <hi>His wife</hi> is
much improved by her diplomatic life, and ſhines in every company,
as a woman of faſhion and elegance. But thoſe who have repaid
me for the reſt, were Lord and Lady Spencer. I ſaw them almoſt
every day, at my houſe or their own, during their ſtay of a month;
for they were haſtening to Italy, that they might return to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
next February. He is a valuable man, and where he is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
a pleaſant companion; ſhe a charming woman, who, with
ſenſe and ſpirit, has the ſimplicity and playfulneſs of a child. You
are not ignorant of her talents, of which ſhe has left me an
agreeable ſpecimen, a drawing of the Hiſtoric Muſe, ſitting in a
thoughtful poſture to compoſe. So much of ſelf and Co. let us
now talk a little of your houſe and your two countries. Does my
Lady ever join in the abuſe which I have merited from you? Is ſhe
ſatisfied with her own behaviour, her unpardonable ſilence, to one of
the prettieſt, moſt obliging, moſt entertaining, moſt, &amp;c. epiſtles
that ever was penned ſince the epiſtles of * * *?
Will ſhe not <hi>mew</hi> one word of reply? I want ſome account of her
ſpirits, health, amuſements, of the elegant accompliſhments of Maria,
and the opening graces of Louiſa: of yourſelf I wiſh to have ſome
of thoſe details which ſhe is moſt likely to tranſmit. Are you patient
in your excluſion from the Houſe? Are you ſatisfied with legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
with your pen? Do you paſs the whole winter in town?
Have you reſumed the purſuits of farming, &amp;c.? What new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections,
public or private, have you formed? A tour to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
would be the beſt medicine for the ſhattered nerves of a ſoldier
and politician. By this expreſſion you will perceive that your letter
to Deyverdun is received; it landed laſt poſt, after I had already
written the two firſt pages of this compoſition. On the whole my
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:0112200701:676"/>
friend was pleaſed and flattered; but inſtead of ſurrendering, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulating,
he ſeems to be making preparations for an obſtinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
He already talks of the right of poſſeſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">His portrait, painted by Sir Joſhua Reynolds.</note>, of the duties
of a good citizen, of a <hi>writ ue exeat regnum,</hi> and of a vote of the
two hundred, that whomſoever ſhall, directly or indirectly, &amp;c. is
an enemy to his country. Between you be the ſtrife, while I ſit
with my ſcales in my hand, like Jupiter on Mount Ida. I begin to
view with the ſame indifference the combat of Achilles Pitt, and Hector
Fox; for ſuch, as it ſhould now ſeem, muſt be the compariſon of
the two warriors. * * *
At this diſtance I am much leſs angry with bills, taxes, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
than I am pleaſed with Pitt for making a friend and a deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man happy, for releaſing Batt from the ſhackles of the law, and
for enhancing the gift of a ſecure and honourable competency, by
the handſome manner in which it was conferred. This I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
to be the caſe, from the unſuſpicious evidence of Lord North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington
and Chief Baron Skinner; and if I can find time, (<hi>reſolution,</hi>)
I will ſend him a hearty congratulation; if I fail, you may at leaſt
communicate my intentions. Of Ireland I know nothing, and while
I am writing the Decline of a great Empire, I have not leiſure to
attend to the affairs of a remote and petty province. I ſee that your
friend Foſter has been hooted by the mob, and unanimouſly choſen
Speaker of the Houſe of Commons. How could Pitt expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the diſgrace of withdrawing his propoſitions after a public
attempt? Have Miniſters no way of computing beforehand the
ſenſe or nonſenſe of an Iriſh Parliament? I am quite in the dark;
your pamphlet, or book, would probably have opened my eyes; but,
whatever may have been the reaſon, I give you <hi>my word of honour,</hi>
that I have never ſeen nor heard of it. Here we are much more
engaged with continental politics. In general we hate the Emperor,
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:0112200701:677"/>
as the enemy of peace, without daring to make war. The old lion
of Pruſſia acts a much more glorious part, as the champion of public
tranquillity, and the independence of the German ſtates.</p>
               <p>And now for the bitter and nauſeous pill of pecuniary buſineſs,
upon which I ſhall be as conciſe as poſſible in the two articles of my
diſcourſe, land and money. * * *
It is impoſſible to hate more than I do this odious neceſſity of
owing, borrowing, anticipating, and I look forwards with impatience
to the happy period when the ſupplies will always be raiſed within
the year, with a decent and uſeful ſurplus in the treaſury. I now
truſt to the concluſion of my Hiſtory, and it will haſten and ſecure
the principal comforts of my life. You will believe I am not lazy;
yet I fear the term is ſomewhat more diſtant than I thought. My
long gout loſt me three months in the ſpring; in every great work
unforeſeen dangers, and difficulties, and delays will ariſe; and I
ſhould be rather ſorry than ſurpriſed if next autumn was poſtponed
to the enſuing ſpring. If my Lady (a good creature) ſhould write
to Mrs. Porten, ſhe may convey news of my life and health, without
ſaying any thing of this <hi>poſſible</hi> delay. Adieu. I embrace, &amp;c.

               <p>HEAR, all ye nations! An epiſtle from Sheffield-Place, received the
ſeventeenth of January, is anſwered the ſame day; and to ſay
the truth, this method, which is the beſt, is at the ſame time the
moſt eaſy and pleaſant. Yet I do not allow that on the laſt paſt
ſilence and delay you have any more reaſon to ſwear than myſelf.
Our letters croſſed each other, our claims were equal, and if both
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:0112200701:678"/>
had been ſtiffly maintained, our mutual ſilence muſt have continued
till the day of judgment. The balance was doubtleſs in my favour,
if you recollect the length, the fullneſs, the variety of pleaſant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
matter of my laſt diſpatch. Even at preſent, of myſelf, my
occupations, my deſigns, I have little or nothing to add; and can
only ſpeak dryly and briefly to very dry and diſagreeable buſineſs.
* * * But we ſhall both agree,
that the true criminal is my Lady; and though I do ſuppoſe that a
letter is on the road, which will make ſome amends, her obſtinate,
contumacious, dilatory ſilence, ſo many months or years ſince my
valuable letter, is worthy a royal tigreſs. * * *
Notwithſtanding your gloomy politicians, I do love the funds; and
were the next war to reduce them to half, the remainder would be
a better and pleaſanter property, than a ſimilar value in your dirty
acres. We are now in the height of our winter amuſements; balls,
great ſuppers, comedies, &amp;c. and, except St. Stephen's, I certainly
lead a more gay and diſſipated life here, among the Alps, (by the
bye, a moſt extraordinary mild winter,) than in the midſt of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
Yet my mornings, and ſometimes an afternoon, are diligently
employed. My work advances, but much remains, indeed much
more than I imagined; but a great book, like a great houſe, was
never yet finiſhed at the given time. When I talk of the ſpring of
eighty-ſeven, I ſuppoſe all my time well beſtowed; and what do you
think of a fit of the gout, that may diſqualify me for two or three
months? You may growl, but if you calmly reflect on my pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary

               <p>BY the difference, I ſuppoſe, of the poſts of France and Germany,
Sir Stanier's letter, though firſt written, is ſtill on the road,
and your's, which I received yeſterday morning, brought me the
firſt account of poor Mrs. Porten's departure. There are few events
that could afflict me more deeply, and I have been ever ſince in a
ſtate of mind more deſerving of your pity than of your reproaches. I
certainly am not ignorant that we have nothing better to wiſh for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
than the fate of that beſt-humoured woman, as you very juſtly
ſtyle her; a good underſtanding and an excellent heart, with health,
ſpirits, and a competency, to live in the midſt of her friends till the
age of fourſcore, and then to ſhut her eyes without pain or remorſe.
Death can have deprived her only of ſome years of weakneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of miſery; and for myſelf, it is ſurely leſs painful to loſe her
at preſent, than to find her in my viſit to England next year ſinking
under the weight of age and infirmities, and perhaps forgetful of
herſelf and of the perſons once the deareſt to her. All this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
true: but all theſe reflections will not diſpel a thouſand ſad
and tender remembrances that ruſh upon my mind. To her care I
am indebted in earlieſt infancy for the preſervation of my life and
health. I was a puny child, neglected by my mother, ſtarved by
my nurſe, and of whoſe being very little care or expectation was
entertained; without her maternal vigilance I ſhould either have
been in my grave, or imperfectly lived a crooked ricketty monſter,
a burden to myſelf and others. To her inſtructions I owe the firſt
rudiments of knowledge, the firſt exerciſe of reaſon, and a taſte for
books, which is ſtill the pleaſure and glory of my life; and though
ſhe taught me neither language nor ſcience, ſhe was certainly the
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:0112200701:680"/>
moſt uſeful preceptor I ever had. As I grew up, an intercourſe of
thirty years endeared her to me, as the faithful friend and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
companion. You have ſeen with what freedom and confidence
we lived together, and have often admired her character and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
which could alike pleaſe the young and the old. All this is
now loſt, finally, irrecoverably loſt! I will agree with my Lady,
that the immortality of the ſoul is at ſome times a very comfortable
doctrine. A thouſand thanks to her for her conſtant kind attention
to that poor woman who is no more. I wiſh I had as much to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud,
and as little to reproach, in my own behaviour towards Mrs.
Porten ſince I left England; and when I reflect that my letters would
have ſoothed and comforted her decline, I feel more deeply than I
can expreſs, the real neglect, and ſeeming indifference, of my ſilence.
To delay a letter from the Wedneſday to the Saturday, and then
from the Saturday to the Wedneſday, appears a very ſlight offence;
yet in the repetition of ſuch delay, weeks, months, and years will
clapſe, till the omiſſion may become irretrievable, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
miſchievous or fatal. After a long lethargy, I had rouzed
myſelf laſt week, and wrote to the three old Ladies; my letter for
Mrs. Porten went away laſt poſt, Saturday night, and yours did not
arrive till Monday morning. Sir Stanier will probably open it, and
read the true picture of my ſentiments for a friend who, when I
wrote, was already extinct. There is ſomething ſad and awful in
the thought, yet, on the whole, I am not ſorry that even this tardy
epiſtle preceded my knowledge of her death: but it did not precede
(you will obſerve) the information of her dangerous and declining
ſtate, which I conveyed in my laſt letter, and her anxious concern
that ſhe ſhould never ſee or <hi>hear</hi> from me again. This idea, and
the hard thoughts which you muſt entertain of me, preſs ſo much
on my mind, that I muſt frankly acknowledge a ſtrange inexcuſable
ſupineneſs, on which I deſire you would make no comment, and
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:0112200701:681"/>
which in ſome meaſure may account for my delays in correſponding
with you. The unpleaſant nature of buſineſs, and the apprehenſion
of finding ſomething diſagreeable, tempted me to poſtpone from day
to day, not only the anſwering, but even the opening, your penulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
epiſtle; and when I received your laſt, yeſterday morning, the
ſeal of the former was ſtill unbroken. Oblige me ſo far as to make
no reflections; my own may be of ſervice to me hereafter. Thus
far (except the laſt ſentence) I have run on with a ſort of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
pleaſure, and find my heart much relieved by unfolding it to
a friend. And the ſubject ſo ſtrongly holds me, ſo much diſqualifies
me for other diſcourſe, either ſerious or pleaſant, that here I would
willingly ſtop, and reſerve all miſcellaneous matter for a ſecond vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer
epiſtle. But we both know how frail are promiſes, how
dangerous are delays, and there are ſome pecuniary objects on which
I think it neceſſary to give you an immediate, though now tardy,
explanation.</p>
               <p>I do not return you any formal thanks for * * *
I have really a hundred things to ſay of myſelf, of you and Co. of
your works, of mine, of my books in Downing-ſtreet, of Lauſanne,
of politics, &amp;c. &amp;c. After this, ſome epiſtolary debts muſt and
SHALL be paid; and to proceed with order, I have fixed this day
fortnight (May twenty-fifth) for the date and diſpatch of your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
epiſtle. Give me credit once more. Pray does my Lady

               </opener>
               <p>THE melancholy event which you have communicated, in your
laſt obliging letter of the twenty-fourth of April, might indeed
be too naturally feared and expected. If we conſult our reaſon, we
can wiſh nothing better for ourſelves than the lot of that dear and
valuable friend whom we have now loſt<note n="*" place="bottom">His aunt, Mrs. Catherine Porten.</note>. A warm heart, a ſtrong
and clear underſtanding, a moſt invaluable happineſs of temper,
which ſhewed her the agreeable or comfortable ſide of every object,
and every ſituation; an eaſy competency, the reward of her own
attention; private friendſhip, general eſteem, a mature age, and a
placid decline. But theſe rational motives of conſolation are inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to check a thouſand ſoft and ſad remembrances that ruſh into
my mind; the intimacy of a whole life; of mine, at leaſt, from the
earlieſt dawn of my infancy; the maternal and aſſiduous care of my
health, and afterwards of my mind; the freedom and frequency of
our converſations; the regret which I felt in our laſt ſeparation, and
the hope, however faint and precarious, of ſeeing her again. Time
alone can reconcile us to this irreparable loſs, and to his healing
power I muſt recommend your grief, as well as my own. I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
applaud her very proper and natural diſpoſal of her effects,
and am proud of the pre-eminence which ſhe has allowed me in a
liſt of dear and worthy relations.</p>
               <p>I am too full of a ſingle idea to expatiate, as I ſhould otherwiſe
do, on indifferent matters; yet not totally indifferent to my friends,
ſince they relate to my preſent ſituation. My health is in general
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:0112200701:683"/>
perfectly good, and the only drawbacks ſome occaſional viſits of the
gout, which abate, however, in ſtrength, and are grown, I think
leſs frequent and laſting. The life which I lead is temperate and
tranquil, and the diſtemper itſelf is not common in the purity and
dryneſs of the climate. After a long trial, I can now approve my
own choice of retiring to Switzerland. My delightful habitation, at
once in town and country; my library, and the ſociety of agreeable
men and women, compoſe a very eligible plan of life, which is
ſhaded with very few, and very ſlight exceptions. I proſecute with
eaſe, and regular diligence, the concluſion of my Hiſtory; and, as
far as I can judge, I may hope to deliver it to the preſs in the courſe
of next year. That important buſineſs will recal me to England,
and detain me there ſome months; and I ſhall rejoice in the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of reviſiting my country and my friends; among them thoſe
of Kenſington-Palace hold a high and diſtinguiſhed place.</p>
               <p>I truly ſympathize, my dear Sir, in your paternal feelings, in the
health and progreſs of your very promiſing children. May that,
and every other bleſſing, attend both yourſelf and Lady Porten.
My friend M. Deyverdun deſires to aſſure you of his reſpect and
good wiſhes. I am, dear Sir, moſt affectionately yours.</p>

Since I have another page, and ſome leiſure moments,
we may as well employ it in friendly converſe; the more ſo, as the
great letter to which I alluded is wonderfully precarious and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
the more ſo likewiſe, as our correſpondence for ſome time paſt
has been of an abrupt and diſagreeable caſt. Let us firſt talk of Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:0112200701:684"/>
works: they are of two ſorts: <hi>Primo,</hi> Two nymphs, whom I
much deſire to ſee; the ſprightly Maria and the gentle Louiſa. I
perfectly repreſent them both in the eye of fancy; each of them
accompliſhed according to her age and character, yet totally different
in their external and internal forms. <hi>Secundo,</hi> Three pamphlets;
pamphlets! I cry you mercy; three weighty treatiſes, almoſt as
uſeful as an inquiry into the ſtate of the primitive church. And
here let me juſtify, if I have not before, my ſilence on a ſubject
which we authors do not eaſily forgive. The firſt, whoſe firſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had ſeen the light before I left England, followed me here in
a more complete condition; and that Treatiſe on the American Trade
has been read, judged, approved, and reported. The ſecond, on
Ireland, I have ſeen by accident the copy you ſent to Mr. Trevor, who
paſſed laſt ſummer (eighty-five) here. The third, and in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſituation the moſt intereſting, on the French Commerce<note n="*" place="bottom">A miſtake—Lord Sheffield did not PUBLISH any tract on French Commerce.</note>, I
have not yet ſeen by any means whatſoever, and you who know
what orders you have given to Elmſly or others, will beſt diſcern on
whom ſhould be laid the fault and the blame. By the bye, Mrs.
Trevor is now here, without her huſband, and I am juſt going to
ſee her, about a mile out of town: ſhe is judged elegant and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
But to return to your books, all that I have ſeen muſt do you
honour, and might do the public ſervice; you are above the trifling
decorations of ſtyle; but your ſenſe is ſtrong, your views im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial,
and your induſtry laudable. I find that your American
Tract is juſt tranſlated into German. Do you ſtill correſpond with
* * *? If he could eſtabliſh a beneficial intercourſe between
the two firſt nations in the world, I would excuſe him ſome little
political tergiverſation. At ſome diſtance of time and place, thoſe
domeſtic ſquabbles loſs much of their importance; and though I
ſhould not forgive him any breach of private friendſhip or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:0112200701:685"/>
I cannot much blame him if he choſe rather to ſerve his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and his country, than to perſevere in a hopeleſs and, as I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
an unpopular oppoſition. You have never told me clearly
and correctly how you ſupport your inactive retreat from the Houſe
of Commons; whether you have reſumed your long forgotten taſte
for rural and domeſtic pleaſures, and whether you have never caſt a
look towards Coventry, or ſome other borough equally pure and
reſpectable. In the ſhort ſpace that is left I will only repeat more
diſtinctly, that in the preſent contemplation of my work, June or
July of next year is the earlieſt term at which I can hope to ſee Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
and if I have a fit of the gout? I have indeed been free from
the monſter this laſt twelvemonth; but he is moſt arbitrary and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious.
Of my own ſituation let me ſay with truth that it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil,
eaſy, and well adapted to my character. All enthuſiaſm is
now at an end; I ſee things in their true light, and I applaud the
judgment and choice of my retirement. I am well, happy, and
diligent; but your kind hint of the London houſe is perfectly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous;
as inſtead of the <hi>ſpring,</hi> we muſt already read the <hi>ſummer</hi> of

appear in England; but it muſt be with my book in my hand; and
a book takes more time in making than a pudding. Adieu. Will
my Lady never write?</p>
               <p>You ſee why I have left a blank in the firſt page; and when I

unpleaſant of my buſineſs; my library in Downing-ſtreet. Excuſe
the accidental derangement; I ſhall ſend for no more books, and

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I RECEIVED your letter this morning (the 16th inſtant), and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
it the ſame day. I am a ſad correſpondent, but it has been
my conſtant endeavour that my negligence ſhould never affect the
intereſt or happineſs of my friends.</p>
               <p>The report you ſo kindly mention is ſomewhat incorrect. I
never could fix a particular day for dining with Lord Sheffield, nor
ſhould I think of performing the journey in the winter month of
February. The laſt autumn was the term which I had fixed in my
hopes, and long ſince in my letters to him. It has been changed
to next ſpring, and by the ſpring I muſt now underſtand the
middle of the ſummer, which I can at preſent aſcertain with ſome
confidence, from a nearer proſpect of the end of my work, which I
ſhall bring over for the preſs. It will conſiſt of three more quarto
volumes, ſomewhat thinner, perhaps, than their predeceſſors; but as
that difference cannot be enough to affect the price, it will be ſo
much ſaved on the author's pains, and the printer's expences. I am
happy to underſtand the public entertain the ſame opinion of the
paſt, and the ſame impatience for the remainder; and, unleſs I am
ſtrangely deceived, their expectation will not be diſappointed. The
three laſt volumes are laboured at leaſt with equal diligence; they
contain a longer period of time, and a far greater variety of events;
and the whole will compriſe a general ſeries of hiſtory, from the
reign of Trajan and the Antonines, to the taking of Conſtantinople
by Mahomet the Second; with a review of Mahomet and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
the Cruſades and the Turks, as far as in their utmoſt latitude
they are connected with the fate of the Eaſtern or Weſtern Empire.
With regard to our pecuniary arrangements, I perſuade myſelf that
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:0112200701:687"/>
we ſhall have no more difficulties now than heretofore; that you
will cheerfully aſſign the ſame value to the three younger as to the
three elder brothers; and that ſo important a tranſaction will have
been concluded in the firſt inſtance by three minutes of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in the ſecond by three lines of a letter; a memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the annals of authors and bookſellers. If you agree with
me on this ſubject, you may provide paper, &amp;c. as ſoon as you
pleaſe in the ſpring, in the full confidence of ſeeing me with my
book in the ſummer; and I ſhould not be ſorry to learn what time
(in uſing the utmoſt expedition) would be ſufficient for printing,
and how late you would conſent to publiſh in the enſuing ſpring.
At this moment, when I am ſtraining every nerve to conclude my
living labours, I am ill-diſpoſed to loſe any time in the dull dead
work of correcting a new edition. When I am in England, quiet
in the country, there would be room and leiſure for a complete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion;
and I ſhould have no objection to place at the end of the
ſixth volume a ſtring of amendments and improvements, which
hereafter might be inſerted in their proper places. We ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have occaſion for a good and general index to the whole.</p>
               <p>I ſincerely condole with you in your various loſſes: Roſe and
Strahan were indeed valuable men. For myſelf, you will rejoice to
hear that I am ſatisfied with my Swiſs retirement; and that, except
ſome mild and tranſient fits of the gout, I enjoy as much health and
happineſs as is compatible with the lot of man. I expect with much
impatience Dr. Robertſon's improved edition. There are three or
four books which I ſhould like to have without delay: that work,
Pennant's Arctic Zoology, White's Sermons (the Arabic profeſſor),
the Annual Regiſters ſince the year 1782. With Elmſley's aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
(he is a ſad dog, but I will write to him ſoon) could you not
incloſe them in a ſmall box, with any other recent publications of
merit, and diſpatch them inſtantly by ſome more coſtly and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
mode of conveyance? I am, moſt faithfully yours.</p>

               <p>AFTER ſome ſallies of wrath, you ſeem at length to have ſubſided
in ſullen ſilence, and I muſt confeſs not totally without reaſon.
Yet if your mind be ſtill open to truth, you will confeſs that I am
not ſo black as I appear. 1. Your Lordſhip has ſhewn much leſs
activity and eloquence than formerly, and your laſt letter was an
anſwer to mine, which I had expected ſome time with impatience.
Bad examples are dangerous to young people. 2. Formerly I have
neglected anſwering your epiſtles on eſſential, though unpleaſant,
buſineſs; and the <hi>res-publica</hi> or <hi>privata</hi> may have ſuffered by
my neglect. Suppoſing therefore we had no tranſactions, why
ſhould I write ſo often? To exchange ſentimental compliments, or
to relate the various and important tranſactions of the republic of
Lauſanne. As long as I do not inform you of my death, you have
good grounds to believe me alive and well. You have a general,
and will ſoon have a more particular idea of my ſyſtem and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here. One day glides away after another in tranquil uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
Every object muſt have ſides and moments leſs luminous
than others; but, upon the whole, the life and the place which I have
choſen are moſt happily adapted to my character and circumſtances;
and I can now repeat, at the end of three years, what I ſoon and
ſincerely affirmed, that never, in a ſingle inſtant, have I repented of
my ſcheme of retirement to Lauſanne; a retirement which was
judged by my beſt and wiſeſt friend a project little ſhort of inſanity.
The place, the people, the climate, have anſwered or exceeded my
warmeſt expectations. And though I truly rejoice in my approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
viſit to England, Mr. Pitt, were he your friend and mine, would
not find it an eaſy taſk to prevent my return. 3. And now let me add
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:0112200701:689"/>
a third reaſon, which often diverted me from writing; namely, my
impatience to ſee you this next ſummer. I am building a great
book, which, beſides the three ſtories already expoſed to the public
eye, will have three ſtories more before we reach the roof and
battlements. You too have built or altered a great Gothic caſtle
with baronial battlements. Did you finiſh it within the time you
intended? As that time drew near, did you not find a thouſand
nameleſs and unexpected works that muſt be performed; each of
them calling for a portion of time and labour? and had you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
nobly deſpiſed, the minute diligence of finiſhing, fitting up,
and furniſhing the apartments, you would have diſcovered a new
train of indiſpenſable buſineſs. Such, at leaſt, has been my caſe.
A long while ago, when I contemplated the diſtant proſpect of my
work, I gave you and myſelf ſome hopes of landing in England laſt
autumn; but, alas! when autumn grew near, hills began to riſe on
hills, Alps on Alps, and I found my journey far more tedious and
toilſome than I had imagined. When I look back on the length of
the undertaking, and the variety of materials, I cannot accuſe, or
ſuffer myſelf to be accuſed of idleneſs; yet it appeared that unleſs I
doubled my diligence, another year, and perhaps more, would elapſe
before I could embark with my complete manuſcript. Under theſe
circumſtances I took, and am ſtill executing, a bold and meritorious
reſolution. The mornings in winter, and in a country of early
dinners, are very conciſe; to them, my uſual period of ſtudy, I
now frequently add the evenings, renounce cards and ſociety, refuſe
the moſt agreeable evenings, or perhaps make my appearance at a
late ſupper. By this extraordinary induſtry, which I never prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
before, and to which I hope never to be again reduced, I ſee the
laſt part of my Hiſtory growing apace under my hands; all my
materials are collected and arranged; I can exactly compute, by the
ſquare foot, or the ſquare page, all that remains to be done; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concluding text and notes, after a general review of my time
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:0112200701:690"/>
and my ground, I now can deciſively aſcertain the final period of
the Decline and Fall, and can boldly promiſe that I will dine with
you at Sheffield-Place in the month of Auguſt, or perhaps of July,
in the preſent year; within leſs than a twelvemonth of the term
which I had looſely and originally fixed; and perhaps it would not
be eaſy to find a work of that ſize and importance in which the
workman has ſo tolerably kept his word with himſelf and the public.
But in this ſituation, oppreſſed with this particular object, and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every hour from my amuſement, to the fatigue of the pen, and
the eyes, you will conceive, or you might conceive, how little ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
I have for the epiſtolary ſtyle; and that inſtead of idle, though
friendly, correſpondence, I think it far more agreeable to employ
my time in the effectual meaſures that may haſten and exhilarate our
perſonal interview. About a month ago I had a voluntary, and not
unpleaſing, epiſtle from Cadell; he informs me that he is going to
print a new octavo edition, the former being exhauſted, and that the
public expect with impatience the concluſion of that excellent work,
whoſe reputation increaſes every day, &amp;c. I anſwered him by the
return of the poſt, to inform him of the period and extent of my
labours, and to expreſs a reaſonable hope that he would ſet the ſame
value on the three laſt as he had done on the three former volumes.
Should we conclude in this eaſy manner a tranſaction ſo honourable
to the author and bookſeller, my way is clear and open before me;
in pecuniary matters I think I am aſſured for the reſt of my life of
never troubling my friends, or being troubled myſelf; a ſtate to
which I aſpire, and which I indeed deſerve, if not by my manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at leaſt by moderation.</p>
               <p>In your laſt, you talk more of the French treaty than of yourſelf
and your wife and family; a true Engliſh <hi>quid nunc!</hi> For my part,
in this remote, inland, neutral country, you will ſuppoſe, that after
a ſlight glance on the papers, I have neither had the means nor the
inclination to think very deeply about it. As a citizen of the world,
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:0112200701:691"/>
a character to which I am every day riſing or ſinking, I muſt rejoice
in every agreement that diminiſhes the ſeparation between neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
countries, which ſoftens their prejudices, unites their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
and induſtry, and renders their future hoſtilities leſs frequent
and leſs implacable. With regard to the preſent treaty, I hope both
nations are gainers; ſince otherwiſe it cannot be laſting; and ſuch
double mutual gain is ſurely poſſible in fair trade, though it could
not eaſily happen in the miſchievous amuſements of war and gaming.
* * *
What a delightful hand have theſe great
ſtateſmen made of it ſince my departure! without power, and, as
far as I can ſee, without hope. When we meet I ſhall adviſe you
to digeſt all your political and commercial knowledge, (England, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France, America,) and, with ſome attention to ſtyle and order,
to make the whole a claſſic book, which may preſerve your name
and benefit your country. I know not whether you have ſeen Sir
Henry Clinton ſince his return: he paſſed a day with me, and
ſeemed pleaſed with my reception and place. We talked over you
and the American war. I embrace the <hi>ſilent my Lady</hi> and the two
honourable Miſſes, whom I ſigh to behold and admire. Adieu.
Ever yours.</p>
               <p>Though I can part with land, you find I cannot part with books:
the remainder of my library has ſo long embarraſſed your room,
that it may now await my preſence and final judgment. Has my
Lady read a novel intitled Caroline de Litchfield, of our home ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture;
I may ſay of ours, ſince Deyverdun and myſelf were
the judges and patrons of the manuſcript. The author, who is ſince
married a ſecond time, (Madame de Crouſaz, now Montolieu,) is a
charming woman. I was in ſome danger. Once more, bar a long
fit of the gout, and the Hiſtorian will land at Dover before the end
of July. Adieu.</p>

               <p>I AM perfectly ſatisfied with your's and Mr. Strahan's cheerful and
liberal aſſent to my propoſal, and am glad to find that your part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
has not degenerated from his worthy father, whoſe loſs I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
lament. The ſole remaining difficulty (of the volumes falling
below the guinea price) it is unneceſſary for the preſent to diſcuſs,
as I think it unlikely to happen. As I am reſolved to finiſh and reviſe
the work before I leave Lauſanne, it will depend on yourſelf to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range
your preparations of paper, &amp;c. in ſuch a manner that we
may loſe no time, but go to preſs the firſt week after my arrival.
But in the mean while I wiſh you to reflect and inquire; 1ſt, In
how many months the impreſſion of the three volumes may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted,
either with ordinary or extraordinary diligence. And,
2dly, How late in next year you would be deſirous or willing to
publiſh. On my reviſal I may find more alterations and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to make than I at preſent foreſee; I may be diſabled by a fit
of the gout; and your ſpeedy anſwer will inform me of the utmoſt
latitude in which I may be indulged, without totally diſconcerting our
common intereſt. You probably agree with me in the neceſſity of
a good general index for the ſix volumes. If you are poſſſeſſed of
an intelligent workman, he might without delay take in hand the
firſt three volumes; but in that caſe I muſt deſire him to ſend me as
ſoon as poſſible a <hi>ſhort</hi> ſpecimen by the poſt. I have thought on the
ſubject of index-making, and can give him ſome advice, which will
abridge the ſize, without impairing the uſe and value of his alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical
table. By a letter of the thirteenth inſtant, Elmſley informs
me that he is on the point of ſending the books; and I hope to
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:0112200701:693"/>
have them here before the end of next month. I propoſe writing
to him very ſoon; but as the events of life are uncertain, it may be
ſafer to anſwer his queſtion through your channel: <q>The author of
Caroline (Madame de Crouſaz) is now become Madame la Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne
de Montolieu by ſecond marriage, and has other cares and
pleaſures beſides thoſe of writing. Her pen is not idle, but her
new ſchemes of romance are not in any degree of forwardneſs
or maturity. Perhaps an handſome propoſal from an Engliſh
bookſeller might ſtimulate her diligence.</q> I am ſincerely yours.</p>
               <p>In our ſtyle of negociation it is almoſt ſuperfluous to ſay that I

ſome ſlight ornaments, the painting and glazing of the laſt finiſhed

intention to depart from Lauſanne about the twentieth of July,
and to find myſelf (<hi>me trouver</hi>) in London on or before the glorious
firſt of Auguſt. I know of nothing that can prevent it but a fit of
the gout, the capricious tyrant, who obeys no laws either of time
or place; and ſo unfortunately are we circumſtanced, that ſuch a fit,
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:0112200701:694"/>
if it came late and laſted long, would effectually diſable me from
coming till next ſpring; ſince thereby I ſhould loſe the ſeaſon, the
monſoon, for the impreſſion of three quarto volumes, which will
require nine months (a regular parturition), and cannot advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
appear after the beginning or middle of May. At the ſame
time do not be apprehenſive that I mean to play you a dog's trick.
From a thouſand motives it is my wiſh to come over this year: the
deſire of ſeeing you, and the <hi>ſilent ſullen</hi> my Lady; the family ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements,
diſcharge of ſervants, which I have already made; the
ſtrong wiſh of ſettling my three youngeſt children in a manner
honourable to them and beneficial to their parents. Much miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
matter riſes to my pen, but I will not be tempted to turn the
leaf. Expect me therefore at Sheffield-Place, with ſtrong probability,
about the fifteenth of Auguſt. Adieu. Yours.</p>

was never fond of deeds of darkneſs, and if the weather be hot, we
muſt repoſe in the middle of the day. Yet the roads are in general
good: between ſun and ſun the interval is long; and, barring the

You ingeniouſly propoſe that I ſhould turn off at Sittingbourn, and

interview is ſo near, that I have little more to add, except a caution
about my own concerns, in which you will confeſs, that from—,

felt ſome flying ſymptoms of the gout: for two ſucceeding days I
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:0112200701:697"/>
ſtruggled bravely, and went in a chair to dine with Batt and Lord
Loughborough: but on Saturday I yielded to my conqueror. I
have now paſſed three weariſome days without amuſement, and
three miſerable nights without ſleep. Yet my acquaintance are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable;
and as virtue ſhould never be made too difficult, I feel that a
man has more friends in Pall-mall than in Bentinck-ſtreet. This fit is,
remarkably painful; the enemy is poſſeſſed of the left foot and knee,
and how far he may carry the war God only knows. Of futurity
it is impoſſible to ſpeak; but it will be fortunate if I am able to
leave town by the end, not of this, but of the enſuing week. What
may be the future progreſs, whether ſlow or rapid, fluctuating or

               <p>ALAS! alas! alas! How vain and fallacious are all the deſigns of
man. This is now the eighteenth of December, preciſely one
month ſince my departure from Sheffield-Place; and it was firmly
my wiſh, my hope, my reſolution, that after diſpatching ſome need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
buſineſs in London, and accompliſhing a pious duty at Bath, I
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:0112200701:698"/>
ſhould by this day be reſtored to the tranquil leiſure, and friendly
ſociety, of Sheffield-Place. A cruel tyrant has diſconcerted all my
plans; my buſineſs in town has been neglected, my attendance at
Bath is juſt begun, and my return is yet diſtant. I was not a little
edified to hear of ſome expreſſions of regret and diſcontent on my
departure; and though I am not able to produce as good evidence,
you will perhaps believe that in the ſolitude of a London lodging I
often railed at the gout for maliciouſly delaying his attack till I was
removed from a place where my ſufferings would have been allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by every kind and comfortable attention. I grew at laſt ſo
deſperately impatient, as to reſolve on immediate flight, without
waiting till I had totally expelled the foe, and recovered my ſtrength.
I performed the journey with tolerable eaſe, but the motion has agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the remains of the humour. I am very lame, and a ſecond
fit may poſſibly be the puniſhment of my raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>As yet I have ſeen nothing of Bath except Mrs. G—; and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as well as propriety, will confine me very cloſely to her. Lord
Sheffield, with Mrs. Holroyd and Maria, dined with us yeſterday.
We begin to throw out hints of the ſhortneſs of our ſtay, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable
buſineſs; and, unleſs I ſhould be confined by the gout,
it is reſolved in our cabinet to leave Bath on Thurſday the twenty-ſixth,
and paſſing through Lord Loughborough's and town, to ſettle
at Sheffield-Place, moſt aſſuredly, before the end of the year. For
my own part I can ſay with truth, that did not the preſs loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
my preſence, I could, without a ſigh, allow the Ducheſs to
reign in Downing-ſtreet the greateſt part of the winter, and ſhould
be happy in the ſociety of two perſons (no common bleſſing) whom
I love, and by whom I am beloved.</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THOUGH you have now been ſome time in London, yet as I heard
of your welfare by different channels, and as I know from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
how much a man has to do who is printing three quartos, even
after he thinks they are altogether ready for the preſs, I have hitherto
forborne to interrupt you by any letter or inquiry of mine. But
there is ſuch a general impatience to ſee your new publication among
people of letters here; and, as your friend, I am ſo frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated
about the length it has advanced, and the time when it
will appear, that I begin to be aſhamed of knowing nothing more
about it than other people. I muſt requeſt of you then to furniſh
me with ſuch information as may both preſerve my credit, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
my own curioſity. My expectations from this part of your
work are, indeed, very high. Your materials begin to improve, and
are certainly much more copious than during a great part of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
you have gone through. You have three or four events as
great, and ſplendid, and ſingular, as the heart of an hiſtorian could
wiſh to delineate. The contemporary writers will furniſh you with
all the neceſſary facts. To adorn them as elegant writers, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for them as philoſophers, never entered into their heads. This
they have left to you.</p>
               <p>Since you went to the continent I have not done ſo much as I
wiſhed. My health, until lately, has been more ſhattered; and as
I advance in life, (I am now ſixty-ſix,) though my faculties, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
are ſtill entire, yet I find my mind leſs active and ardent. I
have, however, finiſhed a very careful reviſe of all my works, and
have given them the laſt poliſh they will receive from my hand. I
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:0112200701:700"/>
have made ſome additions to each of them, and in the Hiſtory of
Scotland pretty conſiderable ones. I have deſired Mr. Strahan to
ſend to you a copy of them uniformly bound, and hope you will
accept of them, as a memorial of my eſteem and affection. You
will ſee that I have got in Mr. Whitaker an adverſary ſo bigotted
and zealous, that though I have denied no article of faith, and am
at leaſt as orthodox as he himſelf, yet he rails againſt me with all
the aſperity of theological hatred. I ſhall adhere to my fixed
maxim of making no reply. May I hope that when you ſee Lord
Loughborough you will remember me to him with kindneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
Our friend Mr. Smith, whom we were in great danger of
loſing, is now almoſt perfectly re-eſtabliſhed. I have the honour to
be, with great truth, your moſt faithful humble ſervant,</p>

               <p>INSTEAD of the Hiſtorian you receive a ſhort letter, in your eyes
an indiſpenſable tribute. This day, at length, after long delay
and frequent expoſtulation, I have received the writings, which I
am now in the act of ſigning, ſealing, and delivering, according to
the lawyer's directions. * * *
I long to be at Sheffield-Place. You
ſee my departure is not poſtponed a moment by idleneſs or pleaſure,
but the preciſe day ſtill hangs on contingencies, and we muſt all be
patient, if our wiſhes ſhould be thwarted. I ſay our wiſhes, for I
ſincerely deſire to be with you. I have had many dinners, ſome
ſplendid and memorable, with Haſtings laſt Thurſday, with the
Prince of Wales next Tueſday at Craufurd's. But the town empties,
Texier is ſilent, and in an evening, I <hi>deſiderate</hi> the reſources of a
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:0112200701:701"/>
family or a club. Caplin has finiſhed the Herculean labour, and
ſeven majeſtic boxes will abdicate on Monday your hall. Severy
has likewiſe diſpatched his affairs, and ſecured his companion Clarke,
who is arrived in town; but his ſchemes are abridged by the inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
rigour of Lord Howe, who has aſſured our great and fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors,
that by the King's order the dock-yards are ſhut againſt
all ſtrangers. We therefore give up Portſmouth, and content our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with two ſhort trips; one to Stowe and Oxford, the other to
Chatham; and if we can catch a launch and review, <hi>encore vit on.</hi>
He (Severy, not Lord Howe,) ſalutes with me the family. Adieu.

paſſages in his ſpeech, on juſtice, filial love, &amp;c.; one of
the cloſeſt chains of argument I ever heard, to prove that Haſtings
was reſponſible for the acts of Middleton; and a compliment, much
admired, to a certain Hiſtorian of your acquaintance. Sheridan, in
the cloſe of his ſpeech, ſunk into Burke's arms; but I called this

               </opener>
               <p>LONG before this I ſhould have acknowledged the receipt of your
moſt acceptable preſent; but for ſeveral weeks I have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with a violent fit of deafneſs, and that unſocial malady is always
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:0112200701:703"/>
accompanied with ſuch a degree of languor, as renders even the
writing of a letter an effort. During my ſolitude the peruſal of your
book has been my chief amuſement and conſolation. I have gone
through it once with great attention, and am now advanced to the
laſt volume in my ſecond reading. I ventured to predict the ſuperior
excellence of the volumes lately publiſhed, and I have not been a
falſe prophet. Indeed, when I conſider the extent of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and the immenſe labour of hiſtorical and philoſophic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch
requiſite towards executing every part of it, I am aſtoniſhed
that all this ſhould have been accompliſhed by one man. I know
no example, in any age or nation, of ſuch a vaſt body of valuable
and elegant information communicated by any individual. I feel,
however, ſome degree of mortification mingled with my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Before you began your hiſtoric career, I uſed to pride myſelf
in being at leaſt the moſt induſtrious hiſtorian of the age; but now,
alas! I can pretend no longer even to that praiſe, and muſt ſay, as
Pliny did of his uncle, <hi>Si comparer illi ſum deſidioſiſſimus.</hi> Your
ſtyle appears to me improved in theſe new volumes; by the habit
of writing, you write with greater eaſe. I am ſorry to find that our
ideas on the effects of the Cruſades do not altogether coincide. I
conſidered that point with great care, and cannot help thinking ſtill
that my opinion was well founded. I ſhall conſult the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
to which I refer; for when my ſentiments differ from yours,
I have ſome reaſon to diſtruſt them, and I may poſſibly trouble you
with a letter on the ſubject. I am much flattered with the manner
in which you have ſo often mentioned my name. <hi>Laetus ſum lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dari
a te landato viro.</hi> I feel much ſatisfaction in having been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by the two hiſtorians of my own times, whoſe favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
opinion I was moſt ambitious of obtaining.</p>
               <p>I hope this letter may find you ſtill in England. When you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Lauſanne, permit me to recommend to your good office my
youngeſt ſon, who is now at Yverdun on account of his health, and
lives with M. Herman, a clergyman there. You will find the
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:0112200701:704"/>
young man (if you can rely on the partial teſtimony of a father)
ſenſible, modeſt, and well-bred, and though no great ſcholar, he
has ſeen much; having returned from India, where he ſerved laſt
war, by Baſſora, Bagdat, Mouſſul, and Aleppo. He is now a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the twenty-third regiment. If you have any friend at Yver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,
be ſo good as to recommend him. It will do him credit
to have your countenance. I have deſired him to pay his reſpects
to you at Lauſanne. Farewell, my dear Sir. I ever am yours moſt

But I ſhould be inexcuſable, did I not thank you for your
kind and ſeaſonable wiſhes, which I can return with equal ſincerity.
I do not propoſe making any improvements or corrections in the
octavo edition which you meditate: ſome ſlight alterations would give
me more trouble than pleaſure. A thorough reviſion of the whole
work would be the labour of many months; it may be the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my old age, and will be a valuable legacy, to renew your
copy-right at the expiration of the laſt fourteen years. In the mean
while, ſome expedition may be uſeful to guard your property from
the unexpected invaſion of <hi>foreign</hi> pirates. Eight volumes in octavo
are already printed at Baſil, and the remainder is expected every day.
I am both glad and ſorry to inform you, that the type is neat, the
paper tolerable, and the text <hi>wonderfully</hi> correct. I hear of another
Engliſh edition in Saxony, and of two French tranſlations advancing
with ſpeed and emulation at Paris. Of the ſucceſs of the work at
home you are beſt qualified, and moſt intereſted, to judge; and I
am happy to find that you expreſs yourſelf, with ſome reſerve, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the ſale. From ſome reports of angry criticiſms, and from
the uſe and abuſe of my name in the papers, I perceive that I am
not forgotten. Before a year has elapſed from the time of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
my Hiſtory will have been peruſed by ſome thouſand readers
of various characters and underſtandings. Each will probably find
ſomething to blame, and I hope ſomething to commend; and the
balance of their private judgments will fix the public eſtimate of its
merit and reputation. Since my return I have been, as I promiſe
in the preface, very buſy an very idle in my library: ſeveral ideal
works have been embraced and thrown aſide; but if the warm
weather ſhould ripen any project to form and maturity, you may
depend on the earlieſt intelligence. I have received a very friendly
and flattering letter from Dr. Robertſon, and have had the pleaſure
of ſhewing ſome civilities to his ſon during his reſidence in this
place. If you can, ſend me a good account of Adam Smith; there
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:0112200701:706"/>
is no man more ſincerely intereſted in his welfare than myſelf. I

               <p>As I am inclined to flatter myſelf that you have no reaſon to be
diſpleaſed with your purchaſe, I now wiſh to aſk you whether you
feel yourſelf diſpoſed to add a ſeventh, or ſupplemental volume to
my Hiſtory? The materials of which it will be compoſed will
naturally be claſſed under the three following heads: 1. A ſeries
of fragments, diſquiſitions, digreſſions, &amp;c. more or leſs connected
with the principal ſubject. 2. Several tables of geography, chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
coins, weights and meaſures, &amp;c.; nor ſhould I deſpair of
obtaining from a gentleman at Paris ſome accurate and well-adapted
maps. 3. A critical review of all the authors whom I have uſed
and quoted<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Gibbon ſoon became tired of this plan, and expreſſed a wiſh it had not been mentioned. He ſaid his Hiſtory was a critical review of the authors he had uſed. S.</note>. I am convinced ſuch a ſupplement might be rendered
entertaining, as well as uſeful; and that few purchaſers would refuſe
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:0112200701:708"/>
to <hi>complete</hi> their Decline and Fall. But as the writer could not derive
either fame or amuſement from theſe obſcure labours, he muſt be
encouraged by other motives; and, in plain Engliſh, I ſhould expect
the ſame reward for the ſeventh, as for any of the preceding vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.
You think and act with too much liberality, to confound
ſuch a large original ſupplement with the occaſional improvements
of a new edition, which are already your property by the terms of
our former convenant. But as I am jealous of ſtanding clear, not
only in law and equity, but in your eſteem and my own, I ſhall
inſtantly renounce the undertaking, if it appears by your anſwer
that you have the ſhadow of an objection. Should you tempt me
to proceed, this ſupplement will be only the employment of my
leiſure hours; and I foreſee that full two years will elapſe before I
can deliver it into the hands of the printer.</p>
               <p>Our friend Elmſley, who poſſibly thinks me dead and buried, will
be, or will not be, ſurprized when you inform him that I have now
a letter of two pages in my bureau addreſſed to him, dated the twenty-ſixth
of May, and not yet finiſhed. Hunger, literary hunger, will
ſoon, however, compel me to write; as I have many queſtions to
aſk, and many commiſſions to give. In the mean while I thirſt for
Mr. Burke's Reflections on the Revolutions of France. Intreat
Elmſley, in my name, to diſpatch it to Lauſanne with care and
ſpeed, by <hi>any</hi> mode of conveyance leſs expenſive than the poſt. He
may add to the parcel the new edition of Adam Smith's Theory of
Moral Sentiments. I heard of his death with more concern than
ſurprize. What a loſs to letters, philoſophy, and mankind!</p>
               <p>I beg you would remember me to Mr. Strahan and all our friends.
In my happy exile, my public and private affections remind me that
I am an Engliſhman. Pray thank Dr. Moore, in my name, for the
pleaſure which I have received from Zeluco, the beſt philoſophical
romance of the age. If he cultivates his talents by any ſimilar
publications, I only wiſh that he would place the ſcene at home;
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:0112200701:709"/>
we may deſcribe the characters, but we can never paint the <hi>manners</hi>
of foreigners; and the quarrel of the two Scotchmen is doubtleſs
the beſt chapter in the book. I am, dear Sir, moſt faithfully
yours.</p>

with the liberality of your ſentiments and conduct. But I am
every day more inclined to believe that on the preſent occaſion they
will not be put to the trial. On a cloſer inſpection, I diſcover more
difficulty and leſs advantage than I had at firſt imagined in the plan
of a ſupplement; and I feel the objection, which you ſo handſomely
decline, againſt encreaſing the weight and price of ſo voluminous a
work. Perhaps it would have been better if my crude idea had not

               <p>I am very happy to hear that our reſpectable friend Dr. Robertſon

I had once a deſign not totally unconnected with his own, but it is
now in far abler hands. Boſwell's book will be curious, or at leaſt
whimſical: his hero, who can ſo long detain the public curioſity,
muſt be no common animal. I ſee you now advertiſe an octavo
edition of Dr. Henry's Hiſtory of England. Is not the author
dead? His plan is excellent, and I wiſh you could engage ſome

diligent and ſenſible man to undertake the continuation. Alas! if
Dr. Campbell were ſtill alive! I have deſired Elmſley to aſk you for
three octavo copies of my own work. Whenever he ſends me a box
of books, I ſhould be glad if you would enrich it with any of your own
valuable publications. Your name is a recommendation; but the

               <p>AS much as I am accuſtomed to my own ſins, I am ſhocked,
really ſhocked, when I think of my long and moſt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
ſilence; nor do I dare to compute how many months I have
ſuffered to elapſe without ſending a ſingle line (Oh ſhame! ſhame!)
to the beſt and deareſt of my friends, who indeed has been very
ſeldom out of my thoughts. I have ſometimes imagined that if the
opportunities of writing occurred leſs frequently, they would be
ſeized with more diligence; but the unfortunate departure of the
poſt twice every week encourages procraſtination, and each ſhort
ſucceſſive delay is indulged without ſeruple, till the whole has ſwelled
to a tremendous account. I will try, alas! to reform; and, although
I am afraid that writing grows painful to you, I have the confidence
to ſolicit a <hi>ſpeedy line,</hi> to ſay that you love and forgive me. After a
long experience of the unfeeling doubts and delays of the law, you will
probably ſoon hear from Lord Sheffield that the Beriton tranſaction
is at laſt concluded, and I hope that you will be ſatisfied with the
full and firm ſecurity of your annuity. That you may long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to enjoy it is the firſt and moſt ſincere wiſh of my heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="690" facs="tcp:0112200701:711"/>
In the placid courſe of our lives, at Lauſanne and Bath, we have
few events to relate, and fewer changes to deſcribe; but I indulge
myſelf in the pleaſing belief that we are both as well and as happy
as the common order of nature will allow us to expect. I ſhould be
ſatisfied, had I received from time to time ſome indirect, but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
information of your health. For myſelf, I have no complaint,
except the gout; and though the viſits of my old enemy are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
longer, and more enfeebling, they are conſined to my feet and
knees; the pain is moderate, and my impriſonment to my chamber,
or my chair, is much alleviated by the daily kindneſs of my friends.
I wiſh it were in my power to give you an adequate idea of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of my houſe, and the beauty of my garden; both of
which I have improved at a conſiderable expence ſince the death of
poor Deyverdun. But the loſs of a friend is indeed irreparable.
Were I ten years younger, I might poſſibly think of a female com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion;
but the choice is difficult, the ſucceſs doubtful, the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
perpetual, and at fifty-four a man ſhould never think of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole ſyſtem of his life and habits. The diſpoſal of Beri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
and the death of my aunt Heſter, who has left me her eſtate
in Suſſex, makes me very eaſy in my worldly affairs: my income is
equal to my expence, and my expence is adequate to my wiſhes.
You may poſſibly have heard of literary projects which are aſcribed
to me by the public without my knowledge: but it is much more
probable that I have cloſed the account; and though I ſhall never
lay aſide the pleaſing occupations of ſtudy, you may be aſſured that
I have no ſerious ſettled thoughts of a new work. Next year I
ſhall meditate, and I truſt ſhall execute, a viſit to England, in which
the Belvidere is one of my powerful loadſtones. I often reflect
with a painful emotion on the imperious circumſtances which have
thrown us at ſuch a diſtance from each other.</p>
               <p>In the moving picture of the world, you cannot be indifferent
to the ſtrange revolution which has humbled all that was high, and
exalted all that was low, in France. The irregular and lively ſpirit
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:0112200701:712"/>
of the nation has diſgraced their liberty, and inſtead of building a
free conſtitution, they have only exchanged deſpotiſm for anarchy.
This town and country are crowded with noble exiles; and we
ſometimes count in an aſſembly a dozen Princeſſes and Ducheſſes.
Burke, if I remember right, is no favourite of yours; but there is
ſurely much eloquence and much ſenſe in his book. The proſperity
of England forms a proud contraſt with the diſorders of France; but
I hope we ſhall avoid the folly of a Ruſſian war. Pitt, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſeems too like his father. Mr. Helrard, a ſenſible man, and
his pupil have left us. They found, as your friends will always
find, the weight of your recommendation with me. I am, deareſt
Madam, ever moſt affectionately yours.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>SOME time before the publication of my Hiſtorical Diſquiſition
concerning India I deſired our friend Mr. Cadell to ſend a copy
of it to you in my name. I hope you received it long ago, and
will allow it to remain in your library, as a memorial of my reſpect
and friendſhip. No man had formed a more decided reſolution of
retreating early from public view, and of ſpending the eve of life in the
tranquillity of profeſſional and domeſtic occupations; but, directly in
the face of that purpoſs, I ſtep forth with a new work, when juſt on
the brink of threeſcore and ten. The preface of the book gives a fair
and ſimple account how this happened. Hitherto I have no cauſe to
repent of a ſtep which I took with heſitation and anxiety. My book
has met with a reception beyond what the <hi>ſpe lenius, paviduſque
futuri,</hi> dared to expect. I find, however, like other parents, that I
have a partial fondneſs for this child of my old age; and cannot ſet
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:0112200701:713"/>
my heart quite at eaſe, until I know your opinion of it. I need
not ſay with what perfect confidence I reſt upon your judgment, and
how happy it will make me to find that this production meets with
your approbation. Nothing will add ſo much to that pleaſure, as
your communicating to me any remarks that occurred to you in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing
it. While I was engaged in compoſing the Diſquiſition it often
occurred to me, that I was more upon your ground than in any of my
former works; and I often wiſhed that I had been ſo near to you as
to profit by your advice and information. Next to that will be the
benefit I may derive from your friendly ſtrictures. Be ſo kind then
as to mention to me any error or omiſſion you have obſerved; every
criticiſm of yours will be inſtructive.</p>
               <p>Permit me to requeſt another favour. You allowed me to hope,
that as ſoon as you fixed upon a new ſubject you would let me
know, and give me the ſatisfaction of indulging the hopes of living
until you finiſhed it. I truſt that you are not idle ſtill. I may now
tell you with authority, that you are yet far from that period of life
when you ſhould lay down your pen. I can ſay from experience,
that the buſieſt ſeaſon of life is the moſt happy; and I have no doubt
that you will concur with me in this ſentiment. Let me know then,
my dear Sir, how you are, what you are doing, and what progreſs
you make. As for my part, I enjoy good health; and, except ſome
fits of deafneſs, am little troubled with the infirmities of old age. I
write this at my ſon-in-law's, Mr. Brydone, who, if he had not a
wife and family, loves Switzerland ſo well, and has ſo many friends
in Lauſanne, that I believe he would gladly join you there. Believe
me to be, with great reſpect, your moſt faithful and obedient ſervant,</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the arts of our great enemy, the daemon
of procraſtination, I ſhould not have poſtponed for ſo many
months a pleaſing duty, which may at any time be performed in a
ſingle hour, had I not for ſome time paſt entertained a lively and
probable hope of viſiting you this autumn in perſon; had I not
flattered myſelf, that the very next poſt I might be able to fix the
day of my departure from Lauſanne, and almoſt of my arrival at
the Belvidere. That hope is now vaniſhed, and my journey to
England is unavoidably delayed till the ſpring or ſummer of next
year. The extraordinary ſtate of public affairs in France oppoſes an
inſuperable bar to my paſſage; and every prudent ſtranger will
avoid that inhoſpitable land, in which a people of ſlaves is ſuddenly
become a nation of tyrants and cannibals. The German road is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſafe, but, independent of a great addition of fatigue and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
the armies of Auſtria and Pruſſia now cover that frontier;
and though the generals are polite, and the troops well diſciplined,
I am not deſirous of paſſing through the clouds of huſſars and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
that attend their motions. Theſe public reaſons are fortified
by ſome private motives, and to this delay I reſign myſelf, with a
ſigh for the preſent, and a hope for the future.</p>
               <p>What a ſtrange wild world do we live in! You will allow me to
be a tolerable hiſtorian, yet, on a fair review of ancient and modern
times, I can find none that bear any affinity with the preſent. My
knowledge of your diſcerning mind, and my recollection of your
political principles, aſſure me, that you are no more a <hi>democrat</hi> than
myſelf. Had the French improved their glorious opportunity to
erect a free conſtitutional monarchy on the ruins of arbitrary power
and the Baſtille, I ſhould applaud their generous effort; but this
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:0112200701:715"/>
total ſubverſion of all rank, order, and government could be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
only of a popular monſter, which, after devouring every thing
elſe, muſt finally devour itſelf. I was once apprehenſive that this
monſter would propagate ſome imps in our happy iſland, but they
ſeem to have been cruſhed in their cradle; and I acknowledge with
pleaſure and pride the good ſenſe of the Engliſh nation, who ſeem
truly conſcious of the bleſſings which they enjoy: and I am happy
to find that the moſt reſpectable part of Oppoſition has cordially
joined in the ſupport of "things as they are." Even this country
has been ſomewhat tainted with the democratical infection; the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of government has been exerted, the malecontents have been
awed, the miſguided have been undeceived, the fever in the blood
has gradually ſubſided, and I flatter myſelf that we have ſecured the
tranquil enjoyment of obſcure felicity, which we had been almoſt
tempted to deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>You have heard, moſt probably, from Mrs. Holroyd, of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
though tranſient ſatisfaction which I received from the
viſit of Lord Sheffield's family. He appeared highly ſatisfied with
my arrangements here, my houſe, garden, and ſituation, at once in
town and country, which are indeed ſingular in their kind, and
which have often made me regret the impoſſibility of ſhewing them
to my deareſt friend of the Belvidere. Lord Sheffield is ſtill, and
will ever continue, the ſame active being; always employed for
himſelf, his friends, and the public, and always perſuading himſelf
that he wiſhes for leiſure and repoſe. There are various roads
to happineſs; but when I compare his ſituation with mine, I do not,
upon the whole, repent that I have given the preference to a life of
celibacy and retirement. Although I have been long a ſpectator of
the great world, my unambitious temper has been content with the
occupations and rewards of ſtudy; and although my library be ſtill
my favourite room, I am now no longer ſtimulated by the proſecution
of any literary work. The ſociety of Lauſanne is adapted to my
taſte; my houſe is open to many agreeable acquaintance, and ſome
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:0112200701:716"/>
real friends; the uniformity of the natives is enlivened by travellers of
all nations; and this ſummer I am happy in a familiar intercourſe
with Lady Spencer, the Ducheſs of Devonſhire, Lady Elizabeth
Foſter, and Lady Duncannon, who ſeems to be gradually recovering
from her ſevere complaints. My health is remarkably good. I
have now enjoyed a long interval from the gout; and I endeavour
to uſe with moderation Dr. Cadogan's beſt remedies, temperance,
exerciſe, and cheerfulneſs. Adieu, dear Madam; may every bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that nature can allow be attendant on your latter ſeaſon. Your
age and my habits will not permit a very cloſe correſpondence;
but I wiſh to hear, and I <hi>preſume</hi> to aſk, a ſpeedy <hi>direct</hi> account of
your own ſituation. May it be ſuch as I ſhall hear with pleaſure!
Once more adieu; I live in hopes of embracing you next ſummer at
the Belvidere, but you may be aſſured that I bring over nothing for

perhaps never to return; but the remembrance of that delightful
period is itſelf a pleaſure, and I enjoy, I cheriſh the flattering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
that it is remembered with ſome ſatisfaction in the gallery of
Florence, as well as in <hi>the library</hi> of Lauſanne. Long before we
were reduced to ſeek a refuge from the ſavages of Gaul, I had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
indulged the thought, or at leaſt the wiſh, of aſking leave to
attend <hi>mes bonnes amies</hi> over Mount Cenis, of baſking once more in
an Italian ſun, and of paying once more my devotions to the Apollo
of the Vatican. But my aged and gouty limbs would have failed
me in the bold attempt of ſcaling St. Bernard, and I wanted patience
to undertake the tedious circumitineration of the Tirol. Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Pays de Vaud next ſummer I hold to be extremely doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
but my anxiety on that head is ſomewhat diminiſhed by the
ſure and certain hope of our all meeting in England the enſuing
winter. I flatter myſelf that the Porter of Devonſhire-houſe will
not be inexorable; yet I am afraid of loſing you amidſt the ſmoke
and tumult of faſhionable London, in which the night is devoted to
pleaſure and the morning to ſleep. My ambition may perhaps aſpire
to paſs ſome hours in the palladian Chiſwick, or even ſome days at
Chatſworth; but theſe princely manſions will not recal the freedom,
the eaſe, the <hi>primitive</hi> ſolitude of dear little Ouchy. Indeed! indeed!
your fair friend was made for ſomething better than a Ducheſs.</p>
               <p>Although you moſt magnanimouſly abandoned us in the criſis of
our fate, yet as you ſeem to intereſt yourſelf in the hopes and fears
of this little country, it is my duty to inform you, that we ſtill
hang in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe; inclining, however, to the ſide of hope,
rather than of deſpair. The garriſon, and even the bourgeoiſie, of
Geneva ſhewed a vigorous reſolution of defending the city; and our
frontiers have been gradually covered with fifteen thouſand intrepid
Swiſs. But the threats of a bombardment, the weight of expence,
and, above all, the victorious aſcendant of the French republic, have
abated much of the firſt heroic ardour. Monſieur de Monteſquiou
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:0112200701:718"/>
diſplayed a pacific, and even yielding, temper; and a treaty was
ſigned, diſmiſſing the Swiſs garriſon from Geneva, and removing
the French troops to the diſtance of ten leagues. But this laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which is indeed objectionable, diſpleaſed the convention,
who refuſed to ratify the agreement. New conferences were held,
new meſſengers have been diſpatched; but unleſs they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to find or to make a ſubject of quarrel, it is probable that we
ſhall purchaſe peace by ſubmiſſion. As Geneva has a very dangerous
democratical party within her walls, and as the national guards are
already allowed to enter the city, and to tamper with the inhabitants
and the garriſon, I will not enſure that poor little republic from one
week to another. For ourſelves, the approaches of danger muſt be
more gradual. I think we are now ſafe for this winter, and I no
longer run to the window to ſee whether the French are coming.
But with ſo many enemies without, and ſo many within, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Bern, and the tranquillity of this happy country, will
be ſuſpended by a very ſlender twig; and I begin to fear that Satan
will drive me out of the poſſeſſion of Paradiſe. My only comfort
will be, that I ſhall have been expelled by the power, and not ſeduced
by the arts, of the blackeſt daemon in hell, the daemon of demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.
Where indeed will this tremendous inundation, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
of numbers againſt rank and property, be finally ſtopped.
Europe ſeems to be univerſally tainted, and wherever the French
can light a match, they may blow up a mine. Our only hope is
now in their devouring one another; they are furious and hungry
monſters, and war is almoſt declared between the convention and
the city of Paris, between the moderate republicans and the abſolute
levellers. A majority of the convention wiſhes to ſpare the royal
victims, but they muſt yield to the rage of the people and the thirſt
of popularity, and a few hours may produce a trial, a ſentence, and
a guillotine. Mr. Necker is publiſhing a pamphlet in defence of thé

to himſelf, than ſervice to his clients. You kindly aſk after the
ſituation of poor Severy. Alas! it is now hopeleſs; all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
are increaſed, all his reſources are exhauſted; where nature
cannot work, the effect of art is vain, and his beſt friends begin to wiſh
him a quiet releaſe. His wife, I had almoſt ſaid his widow, is truly
an object of compaſſion. The dragoon is returned for a few days;
and if his domeſtic ſorrows gave him leave, he would almoſt regret
the want of an occaſion to deſerve his feather and cockade. Your
note has been communicated to Madame de Montelieu; but as ſhe
is engaged with a dying aunt, I have not yet ſeen her. Madame
Dagaiſſeau has haſtily left us; the laſt decrees ſeemed to give the <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grés</hi>
only the option of ſtarving abroad or hanging at home; yet ſhe
has ventured into France, on ſome faint glimpſe of clemency for the
women and children. Madame de Bouillon does not appear to move.
Madame de Stael, whom I ſaw laſt week at Rolle, is ſtill uncertain
where ſhe ſhall drop her burthen; but ſhe muſt ſoon reſolve, for the
young lady or gentleman is at the door;
<q>—Demanding life, impatient for the ſkies.</q>
By this time you have joined the Ladies Spencer and Duncannon,
whom I beg leave to ſalute with the proper ſhades of reſpect and
tenderneſs. You may, if you pleaſe <hi>be, belle comme un ange;</hi> but
I do not like your compariſon of the archangel. Thoſe of Milton,
with whom I am better acquainted at preſent than with Guido, are
all maſculine manly figures, with a great ſword by their ſide, and
ſix wings folding round them. The heathen goddeſſes would pleaſe
me as little. Your friend is leſs ſevere than Minerva, more decent
than Venus, leſs cold than Diana, and not quite ſo great a vixen as
the ox-eyed Juno. To expreſs that infallible mixture of grace,
ſweetneſs, and dignity, a new race of beings muſt be invented, and
I am a mere proſe narrator of matter of fact. Beſs is much nearer
the level of a mortal, but a mortal for whom the wiſeſt man, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:0112200701:720"/>
or medical, would throw away two or three worlds, if he had
them in his poſſeſſion. From the aforeſaid Beſs I have received
three marks of kind remembrance, from the foot of St. Bernard,
with an exquiſite monument of art and friendſhip, from Turin,
and finally from Milan, with a moſt valuable inſertion from the
Ducheſs. At birds in the air it is difficult to take aim, and I fear
or hope that I ſhall ſuſtain ſome reproaches on your not finding this
long epiſtle at Florence. I will mark it N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1.; and why ſhould
I deſpair of my future ſince I can ſay with truth, that ſince
your departure I have not ſpent ſo agreeable a morning. To each
of the dear little Caro's pray deliver nine kiſſes for me, which ſhall
be repaid on demand. My beſt compliments to Mr. Pelham, if he
is with you.</p>

               <p>HAD I not given previous notice of my own unworthineſs, the
plea of being an old incorrigible offender would ſerve only to
aggravate my guilt; it is ſtill ſufficiently black, and I can patiently
hear every reproach, except the cruel and unjuſt imputation of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forgotten my fair friends of the Arno and the Tyber. They
would indeed have been leſs preſent to my thoughts, had I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a regular <hi>weekly</hi> correſpondence; ſince, by the effect of my
negligence, not a <hi>day</hi> has elapſed without a ſerious, though fruitleſs,
reſolution of writing by the very next poſt. What may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
contributed, beſides original ſin, to this vile procraſtination, is
the courſe of events that has filled this abominable winter. As long
as the poor King's fate was on ſuſpenſe, one waited from poſt to poſt,
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:0112200701:721"/>
between hope and fear, and when the blow was ſtruck, even Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's
language was inadequate to expreſs our grief and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I have never approved the execution of Charles the Firſt; yet
Charles had invaded, in many reſpects, the ancient conſtitution of
England, and the queſtion had been judged in the field of Naſeby
before it was tried in Weſtminſter-hall. But Louis had given and
ſuffered every thing. The cruelty of the French was aggravated by
ingratitude, and a life of innocence was crowned by the death of a
ſaint, or, what is far better, of a virtuous prince, who deſerves our
pity and eſteem. He might have lived and reigned, had he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
as much active courage as he was endowed with patient forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
When I read the accounts from home, of the univerſal grief
and indignation which that fatal event excited, I indeed gloried in
the character of an Engliſhman. Our national fame is now pure
and ſplendid; we have nobly ſtood forth in the common cauſe of
mankind; and although our armaments are ſomewhat ſlow, I ſtill
perſuade myſelf that we ſhall give the laſt deadly wound to the Gallic
hydra. The King of Pruſſia is likewiſe ſlow, and your poor friend,
the Duke of Brunſwick, is now not cenſured but forgotten. We
turn our eyes to the Prince of Cobourg and his Auſtrians, and it
muſt be confeſſed, that the deliverance of Holland and Brabant from
ſuch a dragon as Dumourier is a very tolerable employment for the
month of March. Theſe bloſſoms of the ſpring will be followed,
it may be fairly hoped, by the fruits of ſummer; and in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
the troubles of Paris, and the revolt of the provinces, may
promote, by the increaſe of anarchy, the reſtoration of order. I
ſee that reſtoration through a dark cloud; but if France be loſt, the
reſt of Europe, I believe and truſt, will be ſaved. But amidſt the
hurricane, I dare not fix my eyes on the <hi>Temple.</hi> So much for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics,
which now engroſs the waking and ſleeping thoughts of every
feeling and thinking animal. In this country we are tranquil, and I
believe ſafe, at leaſt for this ſummer; though peace has been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:0112200701:722"/>
chaſed at ſome expence of national honour, of the old reputation of
Swiſs courage, we have crouched before the tiger, and ſtroked him
till he has ſheathed his claws, and ceaſed for a moment to roar.
My journey to England this year muſt depend on the events of the
campaign; as I am fully reſolved rather to remain quiet another
autumn and winter in my ſweet habitation, than to encounter the
dangers of the ſea and land. I envy the pleaſures which you and
your companions have enjoyed at Florence and Rome; nor can I
decide which have taſted the moſt perfect delight, thoſe to whom
ſuch beauties were new, or thoſe to whom they were familiar.
A fine eye, correct judgment, and elegant ſenſibility, are requiſite
to qualify the ſtudious traveller; and theſe gifts have been liberally
diſpenſed among the Ouchy caravan. But when you have been
gratified, though not ſatiated, with the Heſperian proſpect, to what
fortunate clime will you direct your footſteps? Have we any hopes
of meeting (for my journey, at all events, would be late) in the
ſhades, or rather in the ſunſhine, of Ouchy? Should Mount Cenis
be ſtill imperious, you have trampled on St. Bernard in a more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
ſeaſon; and whatſoever may be the ſtate of the world, the
Pays de Vaud will afford you a ſecure aſylum, or a pleaſant ſtation.
I rejoice to hear of Lady Beſborough's improvement. Will that
new title make any difference in the plan? Is the Ducheſs very
impatient to reviſit England? Except ſome trifling conſiderations
of children, &amp;c. all countries may be indifferent to her; as ſhe is
ſure of being loved and admired in all. I am anxious and impatient
to learn the reſult of your counſels; but I feel myſelf unworthy of
a regular correſpondence, and am not deſirous of heaping freſh coals
of fire on my head.</p>
               <p>I am happy to find that you forgive and pity my friend Necker,
againſt whom you all entertained ſome Verſailles prejudices. As his
heart has been always pure, he cannot feel remorſe; but as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:0112200701:723"/>
has been unſucceſsful, he is penetrated with grief and regret.
Madame de Stael has written to me from England; ſhe likes the
country, but means to fly over again in May.</p>

               <p>I DO not merely congratulate your Lordſhip's promotion to an office
which your abilities have long deſerved. My ſatisfaction does
not ariſe from an aſſurance of the wiſdom and vigour which admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
will derive from the ſupport of ſo reſpectable an ally. But
as a friend to government in general, I moſt ſincerely rejoice that
you are now armed in the common cauſe againſt the moſt dangerous
fanatics that have ever invaded the peace of Europe; againſt the
new barbarians, who labour to confound the order and happineſs of
ſociety; and who, in the opinion of thinking men, are not leſs the
enemies of ſubjects than of kings. The hopes of the wiſe and
good are now fixed on the ſucceſs of England; and I am perſuaded
that my perſonal attachment to your Lordſhip will be amply gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by the important ſhare which your counſels will aſſume in that
ſucceſs. I could wiſh that ſome of your former aſſociates poſſeſſed
ſufficient ſtrength of mind to extricate themſelves from the toils of
prejudice and party. But I grieve that a man, whom it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for me not to love and admire, ſhould refuſe to obey the
voice of his country; and I begin to fear that the powerful genius
of Mr.<note n="*" place="bottom">A town between Lauſanne and Geneva, where M. Necker then reſided.</note>, inſtead of being uſeful, will be adverſe to the public
ſervice. At this momentous criſis we ſhould enliſt our whole force

               <p>Mr. Necker, in whoſe houſe I am now reſiding on a viſit of
ſome days, wiſhes me to expreſs the ſentiments of eſteem and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
which he entertains for your Lordſhip's character. As a
friend to the intereſt of mankind, he is warmly attached to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of Great Britain, which he has long revered as the firſt, and
perhaps as the laſt aſylum of genuine liberty. His late eloquent
work, <hi>Du pouvoir executif,</hi> which your Lordſhip has aſſuredly read,
is a valuable teſtimony of his eſteem for our conſtitution; and the
teſtimony of a ſagacious and impartial ſtranger may have taught
ſome of our countrymen to value the political bleſſings which they
have been tempted to deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>I cheriſh a lively hope of being in England, and of paying my
reſpects to your Lordſhip before the end of the ſummer: but the
events of the year are ſo uncertain, and the ſea and land are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with ſo many difficulties and dangers, that I am doubtful
whether it will be practicable for me to execute my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I am, my Lord, moſt reſpectfully, and your Lordſhip will permit
me to add moſt affectionately, your moſt faithful humble ſervant.</p>
