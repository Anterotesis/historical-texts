            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

comical ſort of a young gentleman has been plaguing me theſe two days to

eyebrows, and laying his rouge, he threw himſelf into an arm chair, took
three ſorts of ſnuff out of the ſame ſnuff-box, ſneezed into a white
ſilk handkerchief, wiped his mouth with a pink one, got up, looked in the
glaſs, bridled, whirled about upon his heel, and then anſwered the
ſalutation of good morrow, which I had given before all this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

me liſten to the contents of his whole pate folio, ſuch a cargo of
ſonnets, epigrams, lampoons, and paſquinades, enough to furniſh out a
ballad-ſinging Savoyard at a Dutch fair. However, you was determined to bring
your Abbé, and I have brought my Count; we travel in a great ſtile, we

                  <p>Very true, Mr. Guillot; and I dares to ſay you'll be more

                  <p>Well, my dear, what the devil, do you think I don't know a
little about theſe things? did not I tell you how it was? the truth is, the
boy has heard us talk, a thouſand times, in praiſe of Adelaide; from the
picture we drew, he fell in love with her; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to come here to
ſee her; 'tis a fault, but it <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1182700600:57"/> is an honeſt fault, the
effect of a young head, but movement of a good heart.</p>

                  <p>HEAVENS! for what am I reſerved!—how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky was this
rencounter with the Marquis and his lady! they have, without intending it,
expoſed me to the odious addreſſes of this Abbé, and every
danger;—my retreat is diſcovered, and I run a thouſand riſks of
being hourly inſulted.</p>

                  <speaker>Marq.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, my lovely girl, I have been looking for you; do you know you
have robbed my wife and me of a night's ſleep?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marq.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, you—you may remember when we were here before, we
uſed every argument in our power to induce you to go with us to Italy; and
though afterwards, at your earneſt intreaty, we promiſed never to ſay any
more to you on the ſubject, we could hardly refrain from breaking this
promiſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>
                  <p>Alas! Sir, don't think of me!—I am put in the world to

                  <speaker>Marq.</speaker>
                  <p>Look'e, Adelaide, I would not be thought inquiſitively
impertinent; nor do I mean to ſeek any thing but your happineſs. I tell you
my wife and I have been debating the matter all night; and, for the firſt
time, I believe, this ſeven years, we are both in one mind. In conſequence
of our determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I come to offer you my ſon; we are convinced your
birth is as good as ours; and as to fortune, if any <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1182700600:60"/> chance
has robbed you of that, 'tis lucky my boy has a good ſwinging one to put in
his ſcale, which would otherwiſe be overbalanced by your merit. Confide
then to us the ſecret of your diſtreſs; I know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, 'tis
ſomething that will make you more reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in our eyes, for it is
impoſſible that any thing but goodneſs ſhould dwell in ſuch a heart
as your's.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I acknowledge that the notice you have been pleaſed to
take of me, is a diſtinction, with which I had no right to flatter myſelf.
I confeſs, alſo, that I ought to look upon the offer of your ſon, as a
very high compliment; your unparalleled kindneſs will never be eraſed from
my memory; but, Sir, there is an abyſs between the world and me, that nothing
can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leap.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Marq.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear child, the more you humiliate yourſelf, the higher you
riſe in my eſteem; at leaſt, let me ſhew you the neceſſity of
diſcloſing to us your ſituation, that we may know how to ſoften the
rigour of your fate. Conſider what a terrible thing it will be to endure the
inclemency of the ſeaſons without a friend to ſupport, or aſſiſt
you; you'll find no more Blaiſes and Renettes; you'll be an object of envy to
the other villagers. Come, come, Adelaide, I have not made ſuch a fine
ſpeech a long time, and, pray, don't let it be in vain.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Ade.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, you ſhall know my ſtory. I am now going to tell it your
ſon; he ought not to think of me, and I have no other way of reſtoring him
to himſelf and you, than by holding up the unfortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of my
life, that he may be the firſt to ſay 'tis impoſſible we ſhould ever
be united. Thus you will be acquainted with all my unhappineſs; and in return
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1182700600:61"/> for this confidence, I muſt entreat, you, when you leave
this place, to take every poſſible precaution to prevent my being an object
of odious curioſity; and while you ſtay here, to guard me from
importunities, which are as hateful as they are ineffectual.</p>
