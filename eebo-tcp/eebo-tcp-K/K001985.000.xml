            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> Lord Chamberlain of His Majeſty's Houſhold, and Knight of the Moſt Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Young Poet is liable to the ſame Vanity and Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Young Lover; and the Great Man that ſmiles upon one, and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t'other, are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publiſh'd with the firſt Opportunity.</p>
            <p>But there may be a different Motive, which will a little diſtinguiſh the Offenders. For tho' one ſhould have a Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ruining another's Reputation, yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own. And I beg leave, my Lord, that I may plead the latter, both as the Cauſe and Excuſe of this Dedication.</p>
            <p>Whoever is King, is alſo the Father of his Country; and as no Body can diſpute Your Lordſhip's <hi>Monarchy</hi> in <hi>Poetry;</hi> ſo all that are concern'd, ought to acknowledge Your Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Patronage: And it is only preſuming on the Privilege of a Loyal Subject, that I have ventur'd to make this my Addreſs of Thanks to your Lordſhip, which at the ſame time includes a Prayer for Your Protection.</p>
            <p>I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications, which are generally made up of Panegyricks, where the Authors endeavour to diſtinguiſh their Patrons, by the ſhining Characters they give them above other Men. But that, my Lord, is not my Buſineſs at this time, nor is Your Lordſhip <hi>now</hi> to be diſtinguiſh'd. I am contented
<pb facs="tcp:0425200400:4"/>
with the Honour I do my ſelf in this Epiſtle, without the Vanity of attempting to add to, or explain Your Lordſhip's Character.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it is not without ſome ſtruggling, that I behave my ſelf in this Caſe as I ought: For it is very hard to be pleaſed with a Subject, and yet forbear it. But I chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Precept, than his Example, when in his Panegyrick to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> he ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Nec minus conſiderabo quid aures ejus pati</l>
                  <l>poſſint, Quam quid virtutibus debeatur.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quotation, when it is ſo juſtly apply'd. Here are ſome Lines in the Print, (and which Your Lordſhip read before this Play was Acted) that were omitted on the Stage; and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act, which not only helps the Deſign forward with leſs Precipitation, but alſo heightens the ridiculous Character of <hi>Foreſight,</hi> which indeed ſeems to be maim'd without it. But I found my ſelf in great Danger of a long Play, and was glad to help it where I could. Tho' notwithſtanding my Care, and the kind Reception it had from the Town, I could heartily wiſh it yet ſhorter: But the Number of different Characters repreſented in it, would have been too much crowded in leſs room.</p>
            <p>This Reflection on Prolixity, (a Fault for which ſcarce any one Beauty will attone) warns me not to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous now, and detain Your Lordſhip any longer with the Trifles of,</p>

            <l>THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil,</l>
            <l>To cultivate each Tear a hungry Soil;</l>
            <l>And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit,</l>
            <l>When what ſhou'd feed the Tree, devours the Root:</l>
            <l>Th' unlanden Boughs, he ſees, bode certain Dearth,</l>
            <l>Unleſs tranſplanted to more kindly Earth.</l>

            <l>As Nature gave the World to Man's firſt Age,</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE, 
<hi rend="stage">Spoken at the Opening of the New Houſe. By Mrs. <hi>Bracegirdle.</hi>
               </hi>
            </head>
            <l>SURE Providence, at firſt, deſign'd this Place</l>
            <l>To be the Player's Refuge in Diſtreſs;</l>
            <l>For ſtill in every Storm they all run hither,</l>
            <l>As to a Shed, that ſhields 'em from the Weather.</l>
            <l>But thinking of this Change which laſt befel us,</l>
            <l>It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us:</l>
            <l>For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading,</l>
            <l>To help their Love, ſometimes they ſhow their Reading;</l>
            <l>And wanting ready Caſh to pay for Hearts,</l>
            <l>They top their Learning on us, and their Parts.</l>
            <l>Once of Philoſophers they told us Stories,</l>
            <l>Whom, as I think, they call'd<hi>—Py—Pythagories.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I'm ſure 'tis ſome ſuch <hi>Latin</hi> Name they give 'em,</l>
            <l>And we, who know no better, muſt believe 'em.</l>
            <l>Now to theſe Men (ſay they) ſuch Souls were given,</l>
            <l>That after Death ne'er went to Hell nor Heaven,</l>
            <l>But liv'd, I know not how, in Beaſts; and then,</l>
            <l>When many Years were paſt, in Men again.</l>
            <l>Methinks, we <hi>Players</hi> reſemble ſuch a Soul,</l>
            <l>That does from Bodies, we from Houſes ſtroll.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Soul, of old that was,</l>
            <l>May now be damn'd to animate an Aſs;</l>
            <l>Or in this very Houſe, for ought we know,</l>
            <l>Is doing painful Pennance in ſome <hi>Beau:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And this our Audience, which did once reſort</l>
            <l>To ſhining Theatres to ſee our Sport,</l>
            <l>Now find us toſs'd into a Tennis-Court.</l>
            <l>Theſe Walls but t'other Day were fill'd with Noiſe</l>
            <l>Of roaring Gameſters, and your <hi>Damme Boys:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompaſs'd,</l>
            <l>And now they're fill'd with Jeſts, and Flights, and Bombaſt!</l>
            <l>I vow, I don't much like this Tranſmigration,</l>
            <l>Strolling from Place to Place, by Circulation.</l>
            <l>Grant, Heaven, we don't return to our firſt Station.</l>
            <l>I know not what theſe think, but for my Part,</l>
            <l>I can't reflect without an aking Heart,</l>
            <l>How we ſhould end in our Original, a Cart.</l>
            <l>But we can't fear, ſince you're ſo good to ſave us,</l>
            <l>That you have only ſet us up to leave us.</l>
            <l>Thus from the paſt, we hope for future Grace,</l>
            <l>I beg it—</l>
            <l>And ſome here know I have a begging Face.</l>
            <l>Then pray continue this your kind Behaviour,</l>
            <l>For a clear Stage won't do, without your Favour.</l>

               <p>Sir, you're a Gentleman, and probably underſtand this fine Feeding: But if you pleaſe, I had rather be at Board-Wages. Does your <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or your <hi>Seneca</hi> here, or any of theſe poor, rich Rogues, teach you how to pay your Debts without Mony? Will they ſhut up the Mouths of your Creditors? Will <hi>Plato</hi> be Bail for you! Or <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> becauſe he underſtands Confinements, and liv'd in a Tub, go to Priſon for you? 'Slife, Sir, what do you mean, to mew your ſelf up here with three or four muſty Books, in Commendation of Starving and Poverty.</p>

               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sirrah, I have no Mony, you know it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolve to rail at all that have: And in that I but follow the Examples of the wiſeſt and wittieſt Men in all Ages; theſe Poets and Philoſophers whom you naturally hate, for juſt ſuch another Reaſon; becauſe they abound in Senſe, and you are a Fool.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jere.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, Sir, I am a Fool, I know it: And yet, Heav'n help me, I'm poor enough to be a Wit—But I was always a Fool, when I told you what your Expences would bring you to; your Coaches and your Liveries; your Treats and your Balls; your being in Love with a Lady, that did not care a Farthing for you in your Proſperity; and keeping Company with Wits, that car'd for nothing but your Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and now when you are poor, hate you as much as they do one another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>Well; and now I am poor, I have an opportunity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on 'em all; I'll purſue <hi>Angelica</hi> with more Love than ever, and appear more notoriouſly her Admirer in this Reſtraint, than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops that made Court to her; ſo ſhall my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty be a Mortification to her Pride, and perhaps make her compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate the Love, which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowneſs of Fortune. And for the Wits, I'm ſure I'm in a Condition to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with them.—</p>

               <p>Hem!—Sir, if you pleaſe to give me a ſmall Certificate of three Lines—only to certifie thoſe whom it may concern, That the Bearer hereof, <hi>Jeremy Fetch</hi> by Name, has for the ſpace of ſeven Years truly and faithfuly ſerv'd <hi>Valentine Legend,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and that he is not now turn'd away for any Miſdemeanour, but does voluntarily diſmiſs his Maſter from any future Authority over him.—</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jere.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, it's impoſſible—I may die with you, ſtarve with you, or be damn'd with your Works: But to live even three Days, the Life of a Play, I no more expect it, than to be Cannoniz'd for a Muſe after my Deceaſe.</p>

               <speaker>Val.</speaker>
               <p>You are witty, you Rogue, I ſhall want your help;—I'll have you learn to make Couplets, to tag the Ends of Acts; d'ye hear, get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening, and learn the knack of rhiming, you may arrive at the height of a Song, ſent by an unknown Hand, or a Chocolate-Houſe Lampoon.</p>

               <p>But Sir, is this the way to recover your Father's Favour? Why Sir <hi>Sampſon</hi> will be irreconcilable. If your younger Brother ſhou'd come from Sea, he'd never look upon you again. You're un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, Sir; you're ruin'd; you won't have a Friend left in the World, if you turn Poet—Ah Pox confound that <hi>Will</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, it has ruin'd more Young Men than the <hi>Royal-Oak</hi> Lottery—Nothing thrives that belongs to't. The Man of the Houſe would have been an Alderman by this time with half the Trade, if he had ſet up in the City—For my part, I never ſit at the Door, that I don't get dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Stomach that I do at a Horſe-Race. The Air upon <hi>Banſtead-Downs</hi> is nothing to it for a Whetter; yet I never ſee it, but the Spirit of Famine appears to me, ſometimes like a decay'd Porter, worn out with Pimping, and carrying <hi>Billet-doux</hi> and Songs; not like other Porters for Hire, but for the Jeſt's ſake. Now like a thin Chair-man, melted down to half his Proportion, with carrying a Poet upon Tick to viſit ſome great Fortune; and his Fare to be paid him like the Wages of Sin, either at the Day of Marriage, or the Day of Death.</p>

And laſtly, in the Form of a worn-out Punk, with Verſes in her Hand, which her Vanity had preferr'd to Settlements, without a whole Tatter to her Tail, but as ragged as one of the Muſes; or as if ſhe were carrying her Linnen to the Paper-Mill, to be converted into Folio Books, of Warning to all young Maids not to prefer Poetry to good Senſe; or lying in the Arms of a needy Wit, before the Embraces of a wealthy Fool.</p>

               <p>Yes marry will I—A great piece of Buſineſs to go to <hi>Covent-Garden Square</hi> in a Hackney-Coach, and take a Turn with one's Friend.</p>

All well-bred Perſons Lie—Beſides, you are a Woman, you muſt never ſpeak what you think: Your Words muſt contradict your Thoughts; but your Actions may contradict your Words. So, when I ask you if you can Love me, you muſt ſay no, but you muſt Love me too—If I tell you you are Handſome, you muſt deny it, and ſay I flatter you—But you muſt think your ſelf more Charming than I ſpeak you;—and like me, for the Beauty which I ſay you have, as much as if I had it my ſelf—If I ask you to Kiſs me, you muſt be angry, but you muſt not refuſe me. If I ask you for more, you muſt be more angry,—but more complying; and as ſoon as ever I make you ſay you'll cry out, you muſt be ſure to hold your Tongue.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all, Madam: Odsbud you wrong me; I am not ſo old neither, to be a bare Courtier, only a Man of Words: Odd, I have warm Blood about me yet, and can ſerve a Lady a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way—Come, come, let me tell you, you Women think a Man old too ſoon, Faith and Troth you do—Come, don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Fifty; odd Fifty, in a hale Conſtitution, is no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Age.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Fifty a contemptible Age! Not at all, a very faſhionable Age, I think—I aſſure you, I know very conſiderable Beaus, that ſet a good Face upon Fifty; Fifty! I have ſeen Fifty in a Side-Box by Candle-light out-bloſſom Five and Twenty.</p>

               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir <hi>Sampſon,</hi> I have no Quarrel upon my Hands—I have more occaſion for your Conduct than your Courage at this time. To tell you the Truth, I'm weary of living ſingle, and want a Husband.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Odsbud, and 'tis pity you ſhould—Odd, wou'd ſhe wou'd like me, then I ſhould hamper my young Rogues: Odd,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0425200400:76"/>
wou'd ſhe wou'd; Faith and Troth ſhe's deviliſh Handſom. 
<stage>[Aſide.</stage>  Madam, you deſerve a good Husband, and 'twere a pity you ſhould be thrown away upon any of theſe young idle Rogues about the Town. Odd, there's ne'er a young Fellow worth hanging,—that is a very young Fellow—Pize on 'em, they never think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand of any thing;—And if they commit Matrimony, 'tis as they commit Murder, out of a Frolick: And are ready to hang themſelves, or to be hang'd by the Law, the next Morning:—Odſo, have a care, Madam.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore I ask your Advice, Sir <hi>Sampſon:</hi> I have For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune enough to make any Man eaſie that I can like; if there were ſuch a thing as a young agreeable Man, with a reaſonable Stock of good Nature and Senſe—For I would neither have an abſolute Wit, nor a Fool.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Odd, you are hard to pleaſe, Madam; to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye, nor a Fool in the Eye of the World, is a very hard Task. But, Faith and Troth, you ſpeak very diſcreetly; for I hate both a Wit and a Fool.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>She that marries a Fool, Sir <hi>Sampſon,</hi> commits the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of her Honeſty or Underſtanding to the Cenſure of the World: And ſhe that marries a very witty Man, ſubmits both to the Severity and inſolent Conduct of her Husband. I ſhould like a Man of Wit for a Lover, becauſe I would have ſuch an one in my Power; but I would no more be his Wife than his Enemy. For his Malice is not a more terrible Conſequence of his Averſion, than his Jealouſie is of his Love.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>None of old <hi>Foreſight</hi>'s <hi>Sybills</hi> ever utter'd ſuch a Truth. Odsbud, you have won my Heart: I hate a Wit; I had a Son that was ſpoil'd among 'em; a good hopeful Lad, 'till he learn'd to be a Wit—And might have riſen in the State—But, a Pox on't, his Wit run him out of his Mony, and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>Sampſon,</hi> as your Friend, I muſt tell you, you are very much abus'd in that matter; he's no more mad than you are.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>How, Madam! Would I could prove it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>I can tell you how that may be done—But it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concern'd in your Affairs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Odsbud, I believe ſhe likes me—
<stage>[Aſide.]</stage>—Ah, Madam, all my Affairs are ſcarce worthy to be laid at your Feet; and I wiſh, Madam, they ſtood in a better Poſture, that I might make a more becoming Offer to a Lady of your incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0425200400:77"/>
Beauty and Merit.—If I had <hi>Peru</hi> in one Hand, and <hi>Mexico</hi> in t'other, and the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empire under my Feet, it would make me only a more glorious Victim to be offer'd at the Shrine of your Beauty.</p>

               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Bleſs me, Sir <hi>Sampſon,</hi> what's the matter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Odd, Madam, I love you—And if you would take my Advice in a Husband—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, hold, Sir <hi>Sampſon.</hi> I ask'd your Advice for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and you are giving me your Conſent—I was indeed thinking to propoſe ſomething like it in Jeſt, to ſatisfie you about <hi>Valentine:</hi> For if a Match were ſeemingly carried on between you and me, it would oblige him to throw off his Diſguiſe of Madneſs, in apprehenſion of loſing me: For you know he has long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Paſſion for me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Gadzooks, a moſt ingenious Contrivance—If we were to go throw with it. But why muſt the Match only be ſeemingly carried on?—Odd, let it be a real Contract.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Sir Samp.</speaker>
               <p>Say, they would ſay you were a wiſe Woman, and I a happy Man. Odd, Madam, I'll love you as long as I live; and leave you a good Jointure when I die.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ang.</speaker>
               <p>Ay; but that is not in your Power, Sir <hi>Sampſon;</hi> for when <hi>Valentine</hi> confeſſes himſelf in his Senſes, he muſt make over his Inheritance to his younger Brother.</p>
            </sp>
