         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will be found a true obſervation,
tho' ſomewhat ſurprizing, that
when any ſcandal is vented againſt
a man of the higheſt diſtinction and
character either in the State or in
Literature, the publick in general afford it a
moſt quiet reception, and the larger part accept it
as favourably as if it were ſome kindneſs done to
themſelves: Whereas if a known ſcoundrel or
blockhead chance to be but touch'd upon, a whole
legion is up in Arms, and it becomes the common
Cauſe of all Scriblers, Bookſellers, and Printers
whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Not to ſearch too deeply into the reaſon hereof, I
will only obſerve as a <hi>Fact,</hi> that every week for
theſe two Months paſt, the town has been perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0660300100:6"/>
with Pamphlets, Advertiſements, Letters,
and weekly Eſſays, not only againſt the Wit and
Writings, but againſt the Character and Perſon,
of Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi> And that of all thoſe men who have
received pleaſure from his Writings (which by
modeſt computation may be about a hundred
thouſand in theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
not to mention <hi>Jerſcy, Guernſey,</hi> the
<hi>Orcades,</hi> thoſe in the <hi>New world,</hi> and <hi>Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
who have tranſlated him into their languages)
of all this number, not a man hath ſtood up to
ſay one word in his defence.</p>
            <p>The only exception is the Author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poem, who doubtleſs had either a better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
into the grounds of this clamour, or a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s integrity, join'd with
a greater perſonal love for him, than any other
of his numerous friends and admirers.</p>
            <p>Further, that he was in his peculiar intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
appears from the knowledge he manifeſts of
the moſt <hi>private</hi> Authors of all the <hi>anonymous</hi>
pieces againſt him, and from his having in this
Poem attacked no man living, who had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
printed and publiſhed againſt this particular
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>How I became poſſeſt of it, is of no concern to
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0660300100:7"/>
the Reader; but it would have been a wrong to
him, had I detain'd this publication: ſince thoſe
<hi>Names</hi> which are its chief ornaments, die off dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo faſt, as muſt render it too ſoon unintelligible.
If it provoke the Author to give us a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
edition, I have my end.</p>
            <p>Who he is, I cannot ſay, and (which is great
pity) there is certainly nothing in his ſtyle and
manner of writing, which can diſtinguiſh, or
diſcover him. For if it bears any reſemblance
to that of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> 'tis not improbable but it
might be done on purpoſe, with a view to have
it paſs for his. But by the frequency of his
alluſions to <hi>Virgil,</hi> and a <hi>labour'd,</hi> (not to ſay
<hi>affected, ſhortneſs,</hi> in imitation of him, I ſhould
think him more an admirer of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet
than of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and in that, not of the
ſame taſte with his Friend.</p>
            <p>I have been well inform'd, that this work
was the labour of full ſix years of his life, and
that he retired himſelf entirely from all the
avocations and pleaſures of the world, to attend
diligently to its correction and perfection; and
ſix years more he intended to beſtow upon it, as
it ſhould ſeem by this verſe of <hi>Statius,</hi> which
was cited at the head of his manuſcript.
<q>
                  <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0660300100:8"/>
                  <l>Oh mihi biſſenos multum vigilata per annos,</l>
                  <l>Duncia!—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence alſo we learn the true <hi>Title</hi> of the
Poem; which with the ſame certainty as we
call that of <hi>Homer</hi> the <hi>Iliad,</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> the
<hi>Aeneid,</hi> of <hi>Camoens</hi> the <hi>Luſiad,</hi> of <hi>Voltaire</hi>
the <hi>Henriad,</hi> we may pronounce could have
been, and can be no other, than<q>THE DUNCIAD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſtyled <hi>Heroic,</hi> as being <hi>doubly</hi> ſo;
not only with reſpect to its nature, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt Rules of the Ancients and
ſtricteſt ideas of the Moderns, is critically ſuch;
but alſo with regard to the Heroical diſpoſition
and high courage of the Writer, who dar'd
to ſtir up ſuch a formidable, irritable, and
implacable race of mortals.</p>
            <p>The time and date of the Action is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the laſt reign, when the office of City
Poet expir'd upon the death of <hi>Elkanah Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
and he has fix'd it to the Mayoralty of
Sir <hi>Geo. Tho<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ld.</hi> But there may ariſe
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0660300100:9"/>
ſome obſcurity in Chronology from the <hi>Names</hi>
in the Poem, by the inevitable removal of
ſome Authors, and Inſertion of others, in their
Niches. For whoever will conſider the unity
of the whole deſign, will be ſenſible, that the
<hi>Poem was not made for theſe Authors, but
theſe Authors for the Poem.</hi> And I ſhould
judge they were clapp'd in as they roſe, freſh
and freſh, and chang'd from day to day, in
like manner as when the old boughs wither,
we thruſt new ones into a chimney.</p>
            <p>I would not have the reader too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
or anxious, if he cannot decypher them;
ſince when he ſhall have found them out, he
will probably know no more of the Perſons
than before.</p>
            <p>Yet we judg'd it better to preſerve them as
they are, than to change them for fictitious
names, by which the Satyr would only be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied;
and applied to many inſtead of one.
Had the Hero, for inſtance, been called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus,</hi>
