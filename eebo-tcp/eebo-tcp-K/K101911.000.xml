            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The play-houſe would have run with blood on this occaſion, and many ſwords would have been drawn, had not Mr. Faulkner prevailed on his friends (who were preſent every night of the repreſentation) to hear the piece out, and let him take his remedy by law; to which they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obligingly conſented.—<hi>N.

But alas! this lake has been the death of a man, for whom the whole province here is in tears, the late biſhop of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, Dr. Averel, our countryman:—To ſum up all ſhortly as I can, I heard the people of Limerick, (where I was ſhortly after his death) ſay, that there has not been ſuch a biſhop ſince the time of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftles; that the Romiſh clergy ſaid, they ſhould not wonder, had he lived any time, if they had loſt many of their flocks.—What obligations then are due to our Lord Lieutenant, for having appointed ſuch a man their paſtor, for though Heaven has pleaſed to take him away, his ſucceſſor will hear ſo much of him, that he cannot but endeavour to imitate him? I heard this acknowledged by ſeveral, as alſo for his concurrence in appointing that well known friend to his country, and their city, eſpecially, ſpeaker: from theſe and many other like inſtances of his impartial conduct, it is wiſhed that we may never loſe him;—and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day the advantage of a reſident Vice-Roy becomes more and more manifeſt; that from this new mods of government, there is far more likelihood that merit will be rewarded, proper perſons appointed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the laws supported and executed.

The Earl of Cheſterfield, as a proof of his eſteem for his fine talents, made him a barrack-maſter. He is a true friend to the religion of his country, and hath written many excellent tracts in defence of Popery, and the Proteſtant perſuaſion. He wrote a ballad opera, called, Jack the Giant Queller, being a ſatire upon the Lords Juſtices of Ireland, which was accordingly forbid to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. The excellent tragedy of Guſtavus was alſo ſtopped for the ſame reaſon, by the Lord Chamberlain, being a noble incitement to ſedition, in the cauſe of liberty.

My nephew Todd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to believe, that ſomething is intended which he can't diſcover. For my own part, I opine; that it only refereth to the age of the lady, who had attained her fifty-third year. It certainly is not very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel to ridicule this paſſion, which is properly called all-powerful, to ſhew that it ſpareth neither age nor condition, ſtation nor dignity; not to mention the example of Anacreon, who was choaked with a grape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, drinking the health of his miſtreſs, at the age of four-ſcore: I am myſelf this inſtant a captive to the charms of a lady who has paſſed her grand climacteric, and have addreſſed many ſonnets to her, in a ſtyle no leſs tender than the Doctor's, one of which, the moſt admired by my friends, I have ſelected, and venture to publiſh, as a proof of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a ſpecimen of my poetical endowments.</p>

My nephew Todd is of opinion, that the Doctor muſt have had ſome quarrel with his mother: for my own part, how unwilling ſoever I may be to find fault with my author, I cannot but agree with Mr. Kavanagh, and other ingenious friends, that it were better not to divulge family brangles.</note>

                     <hi>Raiſe inſurrections and thy rent.</hi>]—This relateth to a recent fact, which paſſed about ten years ago in the North of Ireland. The Doctor being unwilling, (for the beneſit of the incumbent who was to ſucceed him) that his living ſhould be let at an under value, inſiſted with his pariſhioners, who offered him twelve hundred yearly, to be paid fourteen; which they thinking unreaſonable went to law, and reduced it to the ſum of 700l.</note>

The Iriſh are very unjuſtly charged for a particular talent in blundering; but it is well known, that no people expreſs themſelves in their native tongue, the Engliſh, with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity and preciſion; the Dean of St. Patrick's, who tho' born and bred in England, always declared himſelf, when ſober, to be an Iriſhman.
