            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>BOOK III. ON THE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL AND BODY.</head>
            <p>HITHERTO we have examined the different functions and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm of the body; we have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſoul in its faculties; we have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed theſe faculties in their unfolding and exerciſe: in a word, we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſcover the nature of the ſoul and body by their effects.</p>
            <p>Although this does not convey the full ſcience of Man, it is yet its proper ground work; and without it, we ſhould in vain attempt to explain the arcana of human nature; ſo that the greateſt philoſophers, without this guide, may be ſaid to wander amidſt thick darkneſs. A philoſophic en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer will indeed at times perceive ſome feeble glimmerings of light, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquire a perfect knowledge of the ſubject; he will only collect ſome ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ideas, and unconnected truths, without
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0658602402:7"/>any relation the one to the other. Having therefore conſidered Man in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſubſtances of which he is compoſed; let us now conſider Man properly ſo called, try to diſcover the reciprocal influence of theſe two ſubſtances, and endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate the cauſes of their wonderful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. But before we attempt to reaſon on the cauſes, we muſt firſt aſcertain the effects. We ſhall therefore confine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a preciſe and ſimple expoſition, and reduce our obſervations to thoſe facts which are clear and well ſupported.</p>
            <p>All the parts of nature are connected; air, water, earth, plants, minerals, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and inanimate ſubſtances, are all linked together by ſome correſpondence between cauſes and effects: every being in the univerſe is related to ſome other, and even the great Author of nature him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But in no poſſible union of beings have any two been joined of more oppoſite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or whoſe connexion is more intimate, than the ſoul and body; neither have any two beings a greater or more extraordinary reciprocal influence.</p>
            <p>All beings act one upon the other, not by a blind and fortuitous energy, but by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0658602402:8"/>conſtant and immutable laws; of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the action of the ſoul on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the body on the ſoul, in all animals.</p>
            <p>How plainly ſoever this influence may appear, it has not been examined with ſufficient care and attention: although on ſuch an enquiry depends the knowledge of the principles and laws of this myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence. I ſhall therefore apply myſelf to a cateful examination of theſe relations; and as neither the ſoul nor the body is a ſimple being, as each of theſe ſubſtances is in itſelf compound<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay compound, and deſire the reader not to be alarmed. The ſoul is undoubtedly a compound being, although metaphyſicians maintain it to be a ſimple one, but not compound in the ſame ſenſe with the body; its component parts are the different faculties: moreover obſerve, that the term compound does not imply ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality, nor any way contradict the ſpirituality of the ſoul.</note> and as their conſtituent parts do not all act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that I may not proceed without a plan, I ſhall diſtinguiſh their particular influence, and treat them as diſtinct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. In the prodigious multitude of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which may be made on this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0658602402:9"/>ſubject, I ſhall range, in the ſame claſs, all thoſe which have one common object, connect particular obſervations with thoſe which are general, and, collecting them into one whole, endeavour to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe yet complete hiſtory of the reciprocal influence of theſe two very different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Man has two modes of exiſtence, viz. ſleeping and waking.</p>
               <p>Sleep is properly only a mode of the exiſtence of the body, in which every function of its organs is ſuſpended, except that of the organs of life: in waking, every ſpring of the machine is, or may be in action. In both theſe ſtates the ſoul perceives, thinks, recollects, and all its faculties are in exerciſe; but their exerciſe is performed differently in each of theſe ſtates. Let us therefore examine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the ſoul to the body, and of the body to the ſoul, both when ſleeping and waking.</p>
               <div type="part">

                     <hi>Of</hi> SLEEPING.</head>
                  <p>Obſervation I. As ſleep approaches, the vivacity of our motions decays, the weary limbs relax and yield to their own weight, the head gradually declines on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a ſentiment of pleaſure ſteals on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty organ, and we ſeem to feel the gentle motion of the blood as it flows through the veins. The ſenſes are now inactive, but no part is yet aſleep; ſenſibility gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually leaves the organs, at length the eyes yield to the pleaſing influence of the God, and a refreſhing calm reigns through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body. The ſoul likewiſe partakes in this enchanting ſtillneſs, forgets every thing, even itſelf, and imperceptibly ſinks into inſenſibility. But in this univerſal repoſe, the mind is not inactive, its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are only leſs ſenſible; the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are weak, ſo likewiſe are the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ideas, and the more ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the ſleep is deep.</p>
                  <p>Freed from the power of the ſenſes, the ſoul now enjoys its liberty; it thinks, but its thoughts are irregular, incoherent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected; and from their aſſemblage are formed thoſe phantaſtic images, thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0658602402:11"/>whimſical repreſentations, thoſe phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and flitting ſhades, which conſtitute our nocturnal illuſions.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In ſleep, thought freely rambles over all kinds of objects, and imagination appears to be the only acting power. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſoul at that time appears to be entirely freed from all ſubjection to the body, the diſpoſition of the corporeal organs always determine the nature of the dream. If the ſenſation then felt by the body be agreeable, there is a continual ſeries of pleaſing illuſions and flattering images. On the contrary, if the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be painful, a ſucceſſion of frightful ideas and hideous objects, haunt us during ſleep; monſtrous phantoms, ſcenes of blood and death appear; ghoſts, goblins, and horrible ſpectres terrify us.</p>
                  <p>The influence of the body is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the nature of the objects of our dreams; it likewiſe regulates their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. If the body is afflicted with any languiſhing diſorder, theſe ſpectres and theſe phantoms ſeldom diſappear, and ſeem to haunt us continually. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if the body is affected by any acute diſorder, the illuſions are tranſient, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0658602402:12"/>phantoms aſſume many different forms, and ſucceed each other very rapidly.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething yet more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the analogy between the dream and the then preſent ſenſation.</p>
                  <p>If we at any time experience, during ſleep, thoſe pleaſing titillations, which the ſemen, when redundant, produces on the organs of pleaſure, we fancy we ſee agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects; that we hold converſe with beautiful fair ones, in inchanted groves; they that expoſe all their virgin charms to our fight, and withhold nothing from our deſires. In painful ſenſations, appear phenomena equally ſurpriſing, whereof every one doubtleſs has had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, againſt his will.</p>
                  <p>When we lie in an uneaſy poſture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reſpiration is oppreſſed, and the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the fluids obſtructed, we dream of being purſued by enemies, ſpectres, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, devils, whilſt we have not the power to fly.</p>
                  <p>In the heat of a fever, we dream that we are periſhing with thirſt, that we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe immenſe regions in ſearch of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, without finding any, and that when we have found one, we apply our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0658602402:13"/>parched lips to it, but the water flies back, and all our efforts to allay our thirſt are in vain; ſo that like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> we periſh through want amidſt the greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. In dreams, we think much, feel more, and reflect little; the ſenſations and images ſucceed each other with rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, but the ſoul neither compares nor remembers them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Although in general the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects but very little during ſleep, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reflection is not the ſame in every individual. The ideas, which ſtrongly affect us whilſt awake, are retraced in the mind during ſleep, and we continue to combine them. Thus geometricians form and combine figures, poets make verſes, and philoſophers reaſon.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">

                     <hi>Of</hi> WAKING.</head>
                  <p n="5">V. When the body has been refreſhed by reſt, the organs of ſenſe inſenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their functions, the pulſe gradually quickens, the face regains its colour, and by degrees all thoſe vain images, enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regions, and ideal objects diſappear;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0658602402:14"/>in fine, Man opens his eyes, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious where he is.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid, that the exerciſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoul is not performed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleep, as when we are awake; and even when we are awake, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways performed invariably in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The ſoul grows weary juſt as the body does. When fatigued with too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe or too long application, it loſes in ſome degree the faculty of applying itſelf to one ſubject; the ideas become weak and languid, there are no more ſallies of wit, no more flights of genius. In this ſtate, ſhould we force attention, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately every thing in the mind is effaced, we no longer think, we fall into a kind of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, and a kind of inſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>When the body is fatigued, its motions no longer retain their vigor, all its func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are weakly performed, external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects produce only weak impreſſions on its organs, and the ſenſations have neither force nor vivacity.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The mind not only becomes fatigued like the body, but what is moſt ſingular, they become both fatigued at the ſame time.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0658602402:15"/>The fatigue of the body is always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the fatigue of the ſoul, and the fatigue of the ſoul, by that of the body: the one is never unattended by the other; and what is no leſs ſtrange, the wearineſs of theſe two ſubſtances is equal in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme degree only.</p>
                  <p>Is the body fatigued to exceſs, the mind cannot give attention to any object, its perceptions are weak, and as if paſſive to the objects which are preſented, it no longer thinks nor reflects; it recollects no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and frequently remembers not the impreſſion received but the moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the deſires of the ſoul are weak, it wills nothing ſtrongly, and ſeems not to retain the power of determining itſelf; in ſhort, the ſoul is in a kind of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and, as it were, in a reverie which wears outwardly the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of meditation. Is the mind fatigued to exceſs, external objects produce only weak impreſſions on the ſenſes, and theſe impreſſions produce only weak ſenſations on the ſoul; motion is painful, and all the organs are in a ſtupor.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. In diſeaſes of the body, we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerve reaſon loſt, and a delirium
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0658602402:16"/>overtakes the ſoul; this is evident in the hyſteric affection, that terrible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which afflicts the fair ſex, and is ſo ſingular in its ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>Often when the ſoul is engroſſed by pleaſure, their gaiety gradually diſappears, and a profound ſadneſs ſucceeds; the ſight grows dim, involuntary tears flow, the mouth is half open, every part of the face is convulſed, the limbs loſe their flexibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are violently diſtended, and the body is ſtrongly contorted: when theſe violent agitations, which are of no long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, ceaſe, an extreme ſtupor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, and the countenance wears the livid hue of death: when the complexion has recovered its colour, inſenſibly the other extreme ſucceeds, and the countenance appears inflamed; the pulſation of the temporal arteries is very great, reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is no longer oppreſſed, the unhappy patient fetches deep ſighs, opens her eyes, and ſtares wildly round her. She at laſt recovers her voice; and the diſagreeable ſcene ſometimes concludes in immoderate fits of laughter, often in ſhedding tears and in ſhrieks, and always with incoherent talk.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0658602402:17"/>IX. Another proof of the diſorder of the mind in diſeaſes of the body, is ſeen in a caſe which at preſent offers itſelf to my obſervation.</p>
                  <p>The gay, the agreeable D—, bleſſed with the gifts of fortune, the beloved huſband of a moſt amiable woman, was ſuddenly affected with extreme ſadneſs, the conſequence of immoderate venery. Diſguſted at every thing as if by enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his ſoul receives no pleaſure from the moſt agreeable objects; nothing can engage his attention; what he formerly eagerly ſought after, he now as eagerly avoids; he ſhuns company, and betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſolitude, ſhutting himſelf up alone in his chamber; ſometimes from a penſive ſilence he ſtarts with terror; at others, he mutters ſome extravagant diſcourſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; laſtly, when ſleep has cloſed his eyes wearied with watching, he enjoys no reſt; then hideous ſpectres appear, he cries out for help, and awakes in extreme terror.</p>
                  <p>For ever either quite ſilent or raving, his complexion at times is of a very lively colour, his eyes protuberant, as if ready to ſtart from their ſockets, his looks wild, his limbs violently agitated, he vents his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0658602402:18"/>rage on himſelf, and is ready to tear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in pieces; his eyes afterwards appear ſad, his head reclines on his breaſt, his arms hang down, his whole body is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſtupor, again he falls into a ſullen ſilence and melancholy, burſts into involuntary tears, and fetches deep ſighs.</p>
                  <p>But how many inſtances have we of this ſad truth in thoſe evils to which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſubjected us? How ſlight a cauſe is ſufficient to deprive man of reaſon!</p>
                  <p n="10">X. A ſimple wound ſhall ſometimes render the ſoul delirious.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy perſon, who has been run through the body with a ſword, feels an acute pain in the wounded part, the pain increaſes, and is inſenſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to every part. The body is at firſt ſlightly convulſed, by degrees reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration is oppreſſed, the countenance is inflamed, the eyes are ſwoln, he ſtares wildly round him, and his limbs are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently convulſed. This diſorder of the corporeal organs is inſtantly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſoul, every idea is diſturbed; in this unverſal confuſion, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſufferer knows neither the voice of his friends, nor the features of his parents,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0658602402:19"/>who ſtand round his bed, attempting to awaken ſentiment, and recall life.</p>
                  <p>In theſe diſorders, a foreign power preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the ſoul and ſubdues it, the limbs are in an involuntary agitation, nor can the ſoul keep down its unruly emotions, or reſtrain its tranſports.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. To behold the manner in which the ſoul partakes of the affections of the body, we ſhould almoſt be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it material.</p>
                  <p>In our recovery after a long and high fever, which has conſumed the principle of ſtrength, the ſoul is as weak as the body; the ſenſations have no vivacity, ſentiment is dull, deſire languid, and we receive no pleaſure from the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable objects; recollection is likewiſe decayed, and we ſcarcely remember an action done the moment before: the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is principally affected with this languor: with difficulty we compare the moſt ſimple objects, we cannot reflect, all the faculties of the ſoul are in a ſtupor. The more this diſorder of the body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the weaker is the ſoul; as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans regain their force, conception gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0658602402:20"/>returns, and is not in its vigour till the body is perfectly recovered.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Acute diſeaſes are always attended with weak conception, weak remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and weak recollection; chronical diſeaſes are accompanied with the ſame ſymptoms; but this decay of recollection, conception, and remembrance, is more ſenſible in that affection of the <hi>ductus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullae ſpinalis,</hi> called the <hi>ſpina bifida,</hi> when the tumor is opened, and yet more in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargies.</p>
                  <p>A conſiderable loſs of the ſpermatic fluid produces the ſame phenomena. Hard drinkers commonly become ſtupid in length of time, and loſe all ſentiment, remembrance, and recollection.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy perſons who have been obliged to undergo the operation of the trepan, apoplectics, and thoſe who have been reſtored to life after hanging, remain for a long time ſtupid, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, without conception, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continue for ever after of a dull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and unfaithful memory; not even remembring the pain they felt when they ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0658602402:21"/>XIII. The ſame effects, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by diſeaſes on the ſoul, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produced by violent paſſions, and ſometimes by extreme application. How many are rendered inſenſible by fear! How many by too great attention to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Taſſo,</hi> the celebrated Italian poet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſane by extreme application to ſtudy; in ſome meaſure ſurviving himſelf, forgetting both his name and his works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gallus Vibius,</hi> the famous mimic men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Seneca<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 2. Controv. 9.</note>, loſt his reaſon, by too earneſtly applying himſelf to the imitation of folly.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. Finally, by a kind of prodigy, we obſerve ſome perſons to loſe one part of the powers of the ſoul, and retain the other: ſome loſe the faculties of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reflection, without loſing the judgment; others loſe the recollection, yet retain the remembrance, as if theſe different powers of the mind depended on particular organs of the body.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. The <hi>Microcephali</hi> have leſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, leſs brilliancy of wit, leſs penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0658602402:22"/>than common perſons: whilſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocephali</hi> poſſeſs theſe qualities in a very eminent degree; as if the ſoul were too much confined in the heads of the former, and that the ſpiritual faculties were ever proportionate to the volume of the organs, in which they reſide.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. It is frequently obſerved, on the relations between the body and the ſoul, that very corpulent perſons have commonly no imagination, no ſagacity, no delicacy of wit, they have only good ſenſe. When the degree of corpulency is prodigious, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nearly approaches ſtupidity; the ſoul then appears to be oppreſſed by the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of matter.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. The following ſingular relations between the ſoul and body, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly verified by experience.</p>
                  <p>A quick and penetrating mind is ever united to a<note n="*" place="bottom">Let it be remembered, that when I term a body <hi>ſenſible,</hi> I mean a body endued with an high degree of ſenſibility.</note> ſenſible and vigorous body; and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0658602402:23"/>A profound and ſublime mind is united to a body vigorous and ſtrong<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſpeak not here of the extent of our knowledge, or of the number of ideas. I ſpeak of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters only.</note>. There will certainly appear ſome ſigns of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous mind in a man, whoſe body is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and vigorous; none but thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, who, together with vigour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſtrength of conſtitution, know how to deliver their ideas with energy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued force. Only ſuch could compoſe the Pharſalia of Lucan, the Dramas of Shakeſpear, and the energetic writings of the author of Emilius.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. If delicate and feeble perſons have no vivacity either of body or mind, and if this vivacity of mind ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany vigour of body, it is likewiſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a body extremely delicate and ſenſible, is ever united to an erroneous and inconſiſtent mind; whilſt we ſee that, on the contrary, a body, which is robuſt and leſs ſenſible, ever contains a mind that is proportionably the reverſe.</p>
                  <p>The body influences the ſoul ſeveral ways; we not only obſerve ſtriking rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0658602402:24"/>between it and our ſolids, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve very ſingular ones between the mind and the circulation of our fluids'.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. Whiliſt the blood circulates with great velocity, man is agitated with a kind of phrenzy, raves, loſes his remembrance and reaſon; his ideas are confounded, and in the univerſal diſorder which prevails in his ſoul he forgets his friends, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and even his name.</p>
                  <p>In proportion as the circulation is leſs quick, ſo much the weaker are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul; a gentle calm ſucceeds theſe furious tranſports, it recovers recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and reaſon, and the thoughts fall again into their natural order.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. Whenever the operations of the ſoul are well performed, and the ſoul acts with entire liberty, the blood flows with moderate velocity; on the contrary, it circulates with great rapidity in frenzies, in ſtrong agitations of the mind, and when the lamp of wiſdom is extinct.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. When the body is violently agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, it drives reſt from the ſoul; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in fevers continue ſleepleſs many days; in vain they ſeek for repoſe, their firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0658602402:25"/>is exhauſted, and their ſouls ſoon yield to a mortal languor.</p>
                  <p>The relations obſerved between the ſtate of the body, and the character of the mind, are likewiſe obſerved between the ſtate of the body, and the character of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. A body ſenſible and ſtrong is united to a ſoul, ſuſceptible of violent and moſt durable paſſions.</p>
                  <p>A body robuſt and but little ſenſible is united to a ſoul, ſuſceptible of moderate, yet durable paſſions.</p>
                  <p>A body delicate and ſenſible is joined to a ſoul ſubject to paſſions, ſtrong, but of ſhort duration.</p>
                  <p>A perſon delicate and of ſtrong ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is eaſily kindled into rage, but this is of very ſhort continuance. A vigorous and robuſt perſon is not eaſily inflamed, but his paſſion when excited is of long duration: the rage of the firſt is a fire which blazes, and is ſoon extinguiſhed; that of the other is like the waters of the ocean, which at firſt oppoſe great reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the fury of the winds, but retain their motion a conſiderable time when once excited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0658602402:26"/>Finally, a body feeble, and but of weak ſenſations, is united to a peaceful ſoul, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely exempt from ardor, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences only the weak impulſes of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined will, and knows no more of the paſſions than their name; and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. An impetuous ſoul is ever united to a ſenſible and vigorous body: a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoul to a body robuſt, or endued with little ſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>But there are obſerved yet other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the ſtate of the body, and the character of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. In chronic diſorders, and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtate of convaleſcence after acute<note n="*" place="bottom">I mean thoſe acute diſeaſes, which diſorder all the functions of the animal oeconomy; not thoſe that affect a part only.</note> diſeaſes, the ſoul is languid like the body, nor can any thing give it pleaſure; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which delighted before, no longer excite any emotion, the mind is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, thoughtful, and ſullen; whilſt Man, in vigorous health, is gay, lively and fickle. Exceſſive loſs of ſemen in the male likewiſe affects the ſoul with ſadneſs and languor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0658602402:27"/>You can hardly know, under that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that penſive and melancholy air, effects of immoderate venery, the man who before was ſo ſprightly and ſo gay.</p>
                  <p>The fire which ſparkled in his eyes is extinguiſhed; the livelineſs of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion is gone, and his countenance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the languor of his ſoul; the days paſs unperceived, nothing engages his attention, his drooping ſoul finks into that forlorn ſtate, which is the type of death. Whence does this metamorphoſis proceed? From the loſs of a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the nervous fluid.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. Diſeaſes not only render man thoughtful and ſad, they ſometimes ſteel the heart and beget inhumanity; for you frequently ſee perſons, who are by nature amiable and gay, rendered by ſome diſtemper, reſtleſs, ſuſpicious, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful, ill natured and peeviſh; they grieve for the moſt trifling cauſe, and are diſpleaſed with every thing ſaid or done.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. The gay ſeek after agreeable, diverting and comic amuſements; the ſad, thoſe which are mournful, and of a tragic nature; to theſe joy is diſpleaſing; they would have every thing wear a face of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0658602402:28"/>mourning<note n="*" place="bottom">This obſervation takes place, when the ſoul is a prey to grief, and before it receives any motive of conſolation; but it is never more conſpicuous than in men of a melancholy temper.</note> about them, they tell and hear told, with a kind of pleaſure, tragic ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures; they ſhun the company of the gay, and retire to foreſts, woods, caves, rocks, deſerts, and to ſavage nature, like thoſe reptiles which feed on herbs which are poiſon to others.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. Whilſt all the functions of our organs are well performed, whilſt the fluids circulate within us eaſily, and with a moderate velocity, the body is in health; in this ſtate the ſoul enjoys all the vigour it is capable of. Are the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the body changed? Is the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our fluids languid or difficult? The body is diſeaſed, man is then ſubject to great weakneſs, his powers are inactive, his ſoul is incapable of any great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, he fears every thing, and attempts nothing.</p>
                  <p>Man in health is intrepid, without it, he is puſillanimous.</p>
                  <p n="28">XXVIII. Immoderate coition is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame effects with diſeaſe;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0658602402:29"/>we moreover obſerve that males, who have been deprived of the parts charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of the ſex before they were perfectly developed, ever retain an effeminate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, are leſs vivacious, leſs brave, and leſs fierce, than thoſe who have not been mutilated in this manner.</p>
                  <p>They, who have one teſticle only, are leſs lively, leſs intrepid than thoſe who have two; they, who have three, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably more lively.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. But the manner, in which the affections of the ſoul follow the ſtate of the body, is yet more ſurpriſing. When a ſoldier, in the heat of an engagement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a mortal wound, he becomes the more impetuous; at the ſight of his blood, he is inſpired with a violent paſſion, and with new force; but he ſoon perceives his ſtrength to fail, a freezing cold ſhoots through his veins, all his powers decay, a mortal languor ſucceeds; his courage fails, and his rage declines as the blood ſlows from his wound.</p>
                  <p>There are other relations between the conſtitution of the organs and the mental character.</p>
                  <p n="30">
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0658602402:30"/>XXX. Boldneſs and openneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ever accompany ſtrength and vigour of body. To obtain their deſires, the weak uſe ſtratagem; the ſtrong, open force. This may be obſerved even among brute animals; the weak practice cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whilſt the lion goes ſtraight to his prey and attacks it openly.</p>
                  <p>But between firmneſs and conſtitution, we obſerve relations oppoſite to thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between conſtitution and boldneſs. A delicate, yet vigorous body, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a ſoul endued with fortitude. Thoſe fine gentlemen, who are ſo brave at the head of their company, have no firmneſs when they ſuffer any acute pain. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are more courageous, but leſs firm than men. How many heroes have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted all the dangers of undaunted war, and yet have ſhed tears through extreme pain?</p>
                  <p n="31">XXXI. A very apparent relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conſtitution and mental character is, that weakneſs of mind always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies weakneſs of body.</p>
                  <p>Age, infancy and diſeaſe, are credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; women, more than men: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in witchcraft, reading of dreams,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0658602402:31"/>palmeſtry, old wives tales, ſpirits, phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; in a word, all the extravagancies of human reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="32">XXXII. To an attentive examiner, there appears a conſtant relation between the organization of the body and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The ſoul united to groſs organs, delights in very lively amuſements and noiſy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: united to delicate organs, it loves calm refined amuſements. Lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are moſt agreeable to robuſt men; ſuch delight in warlike muſick, pungent odours, and ſtrong liquors: delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on the contrary love light colours, ſoft muſick, the gentle perſumes of the roſe and jaſmin. The ſame obſervation may be made with regard to the pleaſures of the mind; delicate perſons are averſe to the noiſy amuſements of the robuſt; they are fond of the ſofter pleaſures, the ſweet overflowings of the ſoul, têtes à têtes, and all the enjoyments which ariſe from the tender emotions of the heart.</p>
                  <p n="33">XXXIII. If a great loſs of ſemen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the ſoul in ſadneſs, and ſometimes in a kind of ſtupid inſenſibility, the loſs of a ſmall quantity of the nervous fluid wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0658602402:32"/>the motions of the ſoul, and turns ſentiment into tenderneſs. After the firſt enjoyments the lover is without any live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emotion, though in the full poſſeſſion of that felicity, with which he was inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a few moments before. To his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer violent tranſports ſucceeds a pleaſing ſtillneſs; his love for his miſtreſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, but his paſſion has loſt its ardour; he ſtill preſſes her to his boſom, but no longer devours her charms; his careſſes are more tender, more affectionate, and his mind being entirely engaged by pleaſure, views, with delight, thoſe beauties which had ſo violently enchanted his ſenſes.</p>
                  <p n="34">XXXIV. If the body ſtrongly influence the ſoul, the aliments affect it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner no leſs ſurprizing.</p>
                  <p>What a power has wine over this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material ſubſtance! By this beneficent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, a calm is reſtored to our troubled minds, it drives away pain, fear, ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and introduces hope and joy in their ſtead. By wine, misfortune for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets its evils, and conſuming cares give place to pleaſing illuſions and agreable ideas. By wine, joy preſides at banquets,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0658602402:33"/>gets poſſeſſion of the hearts of the gueſts, and breaks out in ſongs and merriment.</p>
                  <p n="35">XXXV. The power of wine is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the inſpiring hope and joy; it likewiſe inſpires love, and renders the mind bold and free. The ſoldier, whom water could not have kept from flight, having drank wine, boldly meets death, and bravely fights. By wine, are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten witty ſallies, and happy turns of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſpontaneouſly come from the lips; thus wine has been eſteemed the <hi>pegaſus</hi> of poets, and fable has combined Bacchus with the Paphian queen, regarding wine as a principal ſupport of love's empire.</p>
                  <p n="36">XXXVI. But if this beneficent liquor, when drank with moderation, relieves our inquietudes, inſpires bravery, gaiety and candour; what terrible effects are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by its exceſs! Convulſive motions, palpitation of the heart, contortion of the whole body, violent agitations of the ſoul, fury, alienation of mind, loſs of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of remembrance and wiſdom, theſe are its too common effects.</p>
                  <p n="37">XXXVII. What power have other ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments likewiſe on the ſoul! Let the Man, who burns for amorous embraces, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0658602402:34"/>whoſe imagination is buſied with the charms of the fair ſex, be fed for twenty days only with aliments impregnated with acid or nitrous particles; and you will obſerve his paſſion to decay with his ſtrength. Give him afterwards gelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and ſpirituous aliments, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his imagination is revived and his paſſion renewed with its former force.</p>
                  <p n="38">XXXVIII. Aliments affect not the ſoul by their quality only, but by their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>On riſing from a plentiful table, Man is not the ſame as when he firſt ſat down thereto.</p>
                  <p>After eating, the pulſe becomes quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we feel a preſſure at the region of the ſtomach, the body is dull and liſtleſs, the mind becomes ſad and heavy, it is no longer adapted for meditation, or ſallies of wit; we yawn, and at laſt fall faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.</p>
                  <p n="39">XXXIX. The effect produced on the ſoul by exceſs of wine, is occaſioned like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by a ſmall quantity of the <hi>ſolanum verum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Scarce is it diſſolved in the ſtomach, when the members become convulſed, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0658602402:35"/>geſtures wild and the looks full of fury; the <hi>Riſus Sardonicus</hi> ſucceeds and tears begin to flow; in the mean time, the wretched ſufferer ſtammers out many extravagant expreſſions, is furious, and endeavours to bite or tear any object that happens to be near him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſemina hyoſciami &amp; aturae indicae,</hi> deprive the perſon that eats them of the uſe of his ſenſes: he ſees not, even though his eyes are open; he hears not, is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, without ideas, without ſentiment; he is not even ſenſible of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
                  <p>Were I to recount the different virtues of other plants and flowers, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſimilar effects in the ſoul, and which render the wiſeſt furious, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ſtupid; I ſhould never have done.</p>
                  <p>The proſpect of nature produces on the ſoul impreſſions very different, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the objects which offer themſelves to the ſight.</p>
                  <p n="40">XL. Who can be inſenſible to the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentiments which ariſe in the ſoul from the proſpect of a beautiful landſcape, from the view of a fine country, enlightened with the parting rays of the ſun in the evening
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0658602402:36"/>of a ſerene day? We feel a ſudden joy, a ſatisfaction which cannot be expreſſed. The rich foliage of the trees, the enamel and perſumes of the flowers, the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous chant of birds, and the coolneſs of the evening breeze, inſenſibly beget gaiety in the heart, we feel a ſweet ſerenity ſteal upon the mind, we undergo a kind of enchantment, which it is impoſſible to reſiſt<note n="*" place="bottom">I know we are not at all times in an equal diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to receive this joy, to feel theſe pleaſing emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; there are moments in which we tenaciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the heart ſome perplexing ſentiment of ſadneſs, which we continually carry about with us.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="41">XLI. As the proſpect of a fine country, of a pleaſing rural receſs, is adapted to inſpire us with joy; ſo the proſpect of a diſmal deſert, is adapted to inſpire us with ſadneſs.</p>
                  <p>Plains without flowers, without her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, covered with arid ſand; trees blaſted or obſcured with gloomy foliage; enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous maſſes of rocks diveſted of verdure and grown black with age; the noiſe of torrents ruſhing from the ſummit of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, together with the croaking of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and mournful cries of eagles, are hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0658602402:37"/>objects, which convey ſadneſs to the heart though all the ſenſes.</p>
                  <p n="42">XLII. As the proſpect of nature, ſo the air affects the ſoul in different manners, according to its different temperature.</p>
                  <p>Is the atmoſphere thick and heavy? We feel a ſadneſs at the heart, which vaniſhes as ſoon as the air is reſtored to its wonted ſerenity. In the moſt delightful retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are obnoxious to the influence of the atmoſphere, and are gay or ſad, according as the heavens are cloudy or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene. The air even affects our ſenſibility and underſtanding: in cold and dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the mind is much more active, more penetrating than when it is hot or humid<note n="*" place="bottom">Milton's genius was ſublime during the firſt and laſt months of the year only; at other times, his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was oppreſſed; he was then not ſuperior to other men.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſeeing that the ſoul is ſubject to phyſical laws, and is under the influence of the heavens and earth, we might be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe that Man is wholly material. Feeble ſport of the air, and ſeaſons! The ſun and clouds, heat and cold, dry and humid: theſe regulate his character, the complexion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0658602402:38"/>of his mind and his genius; and he is gay or ſad, ſagacious or ſtupid, according to the influence of the winds and meteors.</p>
                  <p n="43">XLIII. Agreeable ſenſations not only generate a ſentiment of love or of joy in our hearts, they likewiſe produce a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calm.</p>
                  <p>If fatigued during the heat of ſummer, we repoſe ourſelves beneath the branches of a tree, which, by its thick foliage, defends us from the rays of the ſun; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in viewing the enamel of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and a variety of delightful objects which then preſent themſelves to our ſight, the gentle zephyrs with their cooling breezes refreſh us, the murmur of brooks, the ſweet perfume of flowers, the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous chant of birds delight the ear, and the whoſe ſoul is drowned in pleaſure: engroſſed by ſweet ſenſations, the mind gradually ceaſes to contemplate the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of its delights; already thought has abandoned it, the other faculties are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and, by an unknown charm, we ſink into a voluptuous repoſe: the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy partakes in this enchanting calm; and, as if it were incapable of watching one moment without its companion, the head
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0658602402:39"/>reclines, the eyes cloſe, and ſleep creeps on all the ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Let this examination of the influence of the body on the ſoul ſuffice; I ſhall now proceed to examine the influence of the ſoul on the body.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION II.</hi> Power of the <hi>SOUL</hi> over the <hi>BODY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>If the power of the body over the ſoul be very great, the power of the ſoul over the body is very great likewiſe. By a ſimple act of volition, the ſoul moves the limbs either ſeparately or all together. In paſſions, it affects the body in a thouſand different manners; at one time, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts either every part at once, or ſome particular parts only; at another, it relaxes them, and deprives them of their tone, and ſometimes it ſo far agitates our organs, diſturbing and varying their oeconomy, as wholly to deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>The power of the ſoul over the body, is as immediate as that of the body over the ſoul, but not as complete. It has, indeed, a direct power on the organs of voluntary motion, but not on thoſe of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0658602402:40"/>life; if at any time it affect theſe, it is only indirectly by their connexion with the organs ſubject to the will, or by the correſpondence of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Neither is the power of the ſoul over the body as continual as that of the body over the ſoul; the influence of the body on the ſoul is permanent; the influence of the ſoul on the body only momentary; and what is ſurpriſing, the body is never ſubordinate to the whole ſoul, but only to ſome one of its faculties excluſively.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore examine the influence of the ſoul on our organs in its different points of view, neglecting that of the will, of which I have already treated when diſcourſing of the mechaniſm of the human body.</p>
               <p>The paſſions cannot continue confined within the heart: they manifeſt themſelves outwardly in the ſound of the voice, in the rapidity of the ſpeech, in the geſture, in the poſture of the body, in the ſtate of its functions; and always differently, according to the nature of the motions agitating the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="44">XLIV. Love, whoſe empire extends over univerſal nature; that violent and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0658602402:41"/>tender ſentiment, ſo celebrated by the poets, ſo well known to lovers, produces ſtrong emotions in the organs of pleaſure, excites a gentle heat in the region of the diaphragm<note n="*" place="bottom">In thoſe vaſcular and nervous parts, termed by anatomiſts <hi>plexus cardiacus.</hi>
                  </note>, tender looks, quick pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adds luſtre to the eyes, envilens the complexion, embelliſhes the countenance, animates the features, and communicates a grace to all our motions.</p>
               <p n="45">XLV. In friendſhip, the ſoul affects the body in the ſame manner, the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the organs of pleaſure excepted<note n="†" place="bottom">We muſt not confound friendſhip with love. Till the time when the organs of ſex are perfectly deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped, Man knows only the firſt of theſe ſentiments; he may indeed love a female, but his affection is only ſuch as he has for his friends; it being only by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret emotions of the organs of pleaſure that he has the knowledge of this ſweet attraction of the ſexes to ſeek each other's company, and to unite in procreative plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note>; nor is it ſtrange it ſhould, friendſhip and love being the ſame affection of the ſoul, and differing only in their object.</p>
               <p n="46">XLVI. Joy produces nearly the ſame effects with happy love. Whilſt the ſoul
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0658602402:42"/>is under the influence of this agreeable ſentiment, the countenance wears a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſmile, the complexion is lively, the eyes ſhine with redoubled luſtre, reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more free, the body receives new vigour, ſenſibility is increaſed, and we feel a voluptuous emotion about the heart. Joy, in the ſame manner with love, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhes the countenance, animates its features, gives expreſſion to its graces, and vivacity to all our actions; it appears like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in our motions, the legs, the arms, the head, are diverſely agitated, as if the body and ſoul were not ſufficiently capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to contain its tranſports.</p>
               <p>Such are the effects of moderate joy; when the paſſion is extreme, they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: an exceſs of pleaſure affects us with languor, ſtupifies the ſenſes, diſorders the motion of our organs, and nearly deprives us of all ſentiment; for Man faints through exceſs of joy, as he does through extreme pain.</p>
               <p n="47">XLVII. How different are the effects of moderate joy from thoſe of ſadneſs! Is the ſoul overwhelmed with ſadneſs? The countenance is pallid, the eyes loſe their vivacity, the muſcles of the face relax;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0658602402:43"/>we feel a tenſion in the region of the heart, a weight on the diaphragm; the circulation is impeded and becomes lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, our ſtrength fails us, and all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is affected with a ſtupor.</p>
               <p n="48">XLVIII. The effects of fear on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are analogous to thoſe of ſadneſs. In fear, the limbs are affected with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tremor, the blood congeals in its veſſels, our ſtrength fails us, the uſe of the ſenſes is ſuſpended, the voice dies away on the lips, languor arreſts our motions, our organs are in a ſtupor, and all their oeconomy is diſordered.</p>
               <p>When fear is extreme, it gives youth the marks of decrepitude<note n="*" place="bottom">The hair of ſome perſons has been obſerved to turn grey inſtantaneouſly through extreme fear.</note>; it extinguiſhes the lamp of life. In ſome, this paſſion has anticipated the executioner and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Man who has had his irons knocked off after condemnation to receive a pardon, has been found dead through exceſs of fear. Another falls lifeleſs at the ſight of an enemy, whom he is going to encounter.</p>
               <p n="49">XLIX. If, when the body is extremely agitated, the ſoul enjoys no repoſe; ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0658602402:44"/>neither does the body enjoy any when the ſoul is ſtrongly affected.</p>
               <p>When night has wrapped all things in her ſable mantle, Man is not always ſure of reſt. Whilſt all other creatures enjoy the bleſſings of repoſe, or ſeek the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of preſent wants, Man is the only one to whom care denies ſleep. The black deſpair and heart-corroding remorſe, which agitate his ſoul during the day, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him amidſt the obſcurity of the night, will not ſuffer him to cloſe his eyes, and harraſs his body continually.</p>
               <p>When the ſoul is ſtrongly affected, want of ſleep exhauſts the laſt remains of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtrength. Thus the tender mother, when her only ſon languiſhes on the bed of ſickneſs, paſſes whole nights and days watching her beloved child, and will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no conſolation. A prey to grief, ſhe enjoys no repoſe; her body is exhauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fatigue, and a mortal languor ſucceeds.</p>
               <p>If every paſſion makes different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on the body; the ſoul, at once agitated by different emotions, produces likewiſe on our organs particular impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as may be remarked in terror, fear,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0658602402:45"/>hopeleſs love, and in the other compound paſſions.</p>
               <p n="50">L. The tender virgin who ſees her lover ſtruck dead at her feet, at once ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fear and ſadneſs, continues immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; a cold ſweat flows down her face, her diſcoloured lips are affected with an involuntary tremor, her cheeks loſe their colour, her arms are extended, her tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eyes are immoveably fixed on the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs body; ſhe ſtands ſpeechleſs, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, immoveable, as if contemplating the greatneſs of her miſery. To ſee her mournful looks, and to view her in this extremity of grief, who would not imagine her inſenſible? Soon her organs become leſs tenſe, her pulſe concentrated gradually becomes more free, her breaſt heaves with frequent ſighs, ſhe flings her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the dead corps, bedews it with her tears, kiſſes thoſe eyes which are now cloſed in the ſleep of death, claſps within her arms his cold remains, and fills the air with her lamentation.</p>
               <p>There are caſes, wherein the effects of this paſſion on the body are yet more ſtrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0658602402:46"/>In the war which Ferdinand made on the queen of Hungary, a young warrior, who had greatly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in an engagement near Buda, was carried dead from the field; Raſciac, an officer in the ſame army, on viewing the body, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it to be his own ſon, grows pale and expires<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Eſſays of Montaigne.</note>.</p>
               <p n="51">LI. In attention, that is, in curioſity mixed with hope or fear, we are agitated, we hear, we obſerve every circumſtance. At the leaſt noiſe the heart beats, the eyes are ſometimes fixed, and ſometimes wandering. Should the object appear, we are ſeized with a palpitation of heart yet more violent, reſpiration is obſtructed, the voice faulters, and the functions of the ſenſes are interrupted.</p>
               <p n="52">LII. Anger, that ſingular affection wherein grief, hatred and deſire of revenge are confounded, produces very different effects on the organs, according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents then affecting the ſoul. At one time, it ſpreads a death-like paleneſs over the countenance, and agitates the body with convulſive motions and involuntary
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0658602402:47"/>tremors. At others, it gives elaſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our muſcles, lends us new force, and for ſome moments raiſes us above our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe impetuous motions of the ſoul are moſt ſtrongly expreſſed in the countenance, the looks are wild and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the mouth foams, the voice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and hoarſe, the brow ſevere, the whole face is inflamed and wears a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing air.</p>
               <p>In rage or exceſſive anger Man becomes frantic, his motions impetuous, his limbs loſe their flexibility, and his body is violently contorted: the ſoul at that time raiſes a ferment in the blood, juſt as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous winds rouſe the waves of the ſea.</p>
               <p n="53">LIII. Terror, that painful emotion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the ſoul by fearful exclamations, the cries of fury or the ſight of imminent danger, and always compounded of dread of the object terrifying us, and an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable deſire to avoid it, produces like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very different effects on the ſoul. At times, we feel an univerſal tremor, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakneſs, a general ſtupor, which diſable the body from obeying the ſoul, and ſuſpend the uſe of our ſenſations; the voice faulters and dies on the lips, we
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0658602402:48"/>make many ineffectual efforts to fly, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor prevents us from moving, and this ſtupor of the organs ſometimes, though but ſeldom, deſtroys their mechaniſm. At other times, inſtead of being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, this paſſion gives us vigor, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us more alert, and endues us with a more than common force.</p>
               <p n="54">LIV. And here let us obſerve, that every violent paſſion, which begins by increaſing the ſtrength of the body, in the end affects it with languor: rage at firſt makes a ſurprizing addition to our ſtrength; but this force ſoon fails us, we experience a weakneſs, which deprives us both of the will and of the power of making new efforts; at that time, being incapable of any vigorous act, we become languid and dejected.</p>
               <p n="55">LV. How different is happy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy love! The hapleſs fair one, at once poſſeſſed with love and filled with deſpair, conſumed with eager deſires, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of him who alone can make her happy, abandoned to her melancholy thoughts, condemned to ſpend her life in bewailing her hopeleſs paſſion, and in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0658602402:49"/>feeding on her own afflictions, at firſt perceives a tenſion about the diaphragm, a violent heat in the region of the heart, and a fever is kindled up in her veins. When the heat of her paſſion ſubſides, her ſoul ſuccumbs under its miſery, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire rages within, and deprives her of the ſweets of repoſe, her ſtrength fails her, grief preys upon her bloom and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs her health. The fire which once ſparkled in her eyes is now extinguiſhed, grown heavy and dim, the light ſeems o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and painful, her limbs tremble and ſink under her weight, and ſhe can hardly ſupport herſelf; the roſes and lillies leave her wan cheeks, her forehead is covered with wrinkles, and her face wears the marks of age. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times her whole countenance is fluſtered with a glowing red, involuntary tears trickle down her cheeks; and ſo exceſſive is her miſery, that ſhe is wholly engroſſed by the ſenſe of her ſufferings, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to every thing beſides.</p>
               <p n="56">LVI. The violent paſſions not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the oeconomy of our organs; they appear outwardly in involuntary motions, and mechanical impreſſions. The arms,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0658602402:50"/>legs, head, and even the whole body take different poſitions, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent motions which actuate us. In ſhame, the head inclines forward; in ſadneſs on one ſide; in pride it is erect, it is drawn back in aſtoniſhment, and in hatred and indignation it moves from ſide to ſide in different ways. In anger, as in joy, the whole body is agitated with various precipitate motions.</p>
               <p n="57">LVII. The paſſions do not always act in concert; they ſometimes act in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to each other; accordingly, in theſe conflicts, they affect the body in different ways.</p>
               <p>Obſerve that man, under ſome affliction of mind, which he would fain ſmother within his own breaſt. In this ſtate, the violence of the motions which actuate him, and the efforts he makes to conceal his trouble, occaſion a burning heat, a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of heavineſs in the head, and a kind of ebriety which makes hi ſcarcely know himſelf. His eyes ſparkle with rage, his countenance is inflamed, he feels an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion at his breaſt, which obſtructs reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration. Should he, during this inward ſtruggle, meet with any thing which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0658602402:51"/>his trouble; unable to reſiſt the emotions of his ſoul, his limbs are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly agitated, he gives way to his fury, and utters terrible cries with a broken and faultering voice. This frenzy is frequently ſucceeded by more violent ſymptoms; whilſt the paroxyſm laſts, he reels, falls, remains motionleſs, becomes inſenſible, and has not even any ſenſe of what he ſuffers.</p>
               <p n="58">LVIII. Although in theſe different paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the ſoul affects differently every part of the body, yet in none are they more viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than in the countenance, in none they diſplay themſelves with greater energy.</p>
               <p>When the ſoul is calm, all the parts of the countenance are in a ſtate of reſt; their union then produces a pleaſing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which correſponds with the calm within. But when the ſoul is agitated, the face becomes a living table, whereon every paſſion is delineated in the different features with equal exactneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>In joy, the eyes acquire new luſtre, the complexion brightens, the brows become more arched, the noſtrils expand, the corners of the mouth ſomewhat recede
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0658602402:52"/>from each other, the cheeks are gently contracted, and the lips formed into a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſmile.</p>
               <p>In ſadneſs, the eyes become dead and fixed, the pupil is half raiſed and half hid by the eye-lid, which is a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the cheeks are pale, the corners of the mouth fall, the lower lip is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upwards, the other muſcles of the face are relaxed, the viſage is lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the eyes are ſwoln, and dimmed by a copious moiſture which is afterwards diſcharged in tears.</p>
               <p>In ſhame and in modeſty, the muſcles of the face are contracted, the eyes are turned downwards, and covered with the eye-lids, the mouth is ſomewhat open, and the complexion of a deeper red.</p>
               <p>If every paſſion is expreſſed on the countenance by different lineaments, the concourſe of theſe different lineaments is properly adapted to expreſs the mixed paſſions.</p>
               <p>In terror and affright, the forehead becomes wrinkled, the eye-brows are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in the parts towards the temples, and are depreſſed at the other extremity; the eye-lids are wide open, leaving the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0658602402:53"/>pupil and half the white bare, the lips are drawn back at their extremities, the mouth is open, and all the muſcles of the face appear contracted and ſtrongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In contempt and deriſion, the upper lip is drawn ſomewhat on one ſide, ſo that the teeth appear; in the other is obſerved a ſmall motion, faintly reſembling a ſmile, the noſe is drawn to the ſame ſide with the upper lip, the eye on that ſide is half ſhut; whilſt the other continues unchanged, the pupil of both being depreſſed as when we look downwards.</p>
               <p>Of all the parts of the face, the eye is the moſt expreſſive. This is the only organ wherein Man cannot conceal the paſſion in his breaſt. The different paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are expreſſed by a ſudden alteration in the eyes; in theſe appear complacency, envy, rage, fury, contempt, trouble, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety, deſpair, in all their various grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note n="*" place="bottom">This expreſſion of the eye is owing in great part to the different movements of the <hi>Palpebrae</hi> and the adjacent parts.</note>. In theſe too we may read vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcouragement; in a word, every affection of the ſoul is reflected by theſe admirable organs, as the images of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0658602402:54"/>by a well poliſhed mirror; even the moſt ſecret emotions of the heart are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by them.</p>
               <p>Every one muſt have obſerved the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of two lovers on the intruſion of a third perſon. When they cannot freely indulge the mutual emotion of their hearts, what expreſſion! What eloquence in the eye; at that time the ſole interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their ſentiments! How inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly does the ſoul diſplay itſelf in the motions of theſe organs? Their paſſions, their deſigns, their hopes, their fears are expreſſed in a ſingle glance.</p>
               <p>But it is time to leave the conſideration of the influence of the ſenſibility of the ſoul on the body, and to examine that of the underſtanding thereon.</p>
               <p n="59">LIX. Reflection fatigues the mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more, and much ſooner than muſing or revery. The exerciſe of reaſon is to the ſoul, what voluntary motion is to the body, a ſtate of contention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
               <p n="60">LX. When the ſoul is concentrated within itſelf, and wrapped in profound thought, we perceive a tenſion in the <hi>plexus cordiacus,</hi> in the membranes of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0658602402:55"/>brain, but eſpecially in the parts ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes. This tenſion is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſenſation of heat, which may be removed by the action of the cold air; the pulſe is quicker than common, the countenance becomes more florid, and the breaſt heaves with ſtrong reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as may be remarked in ſtudious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or in men of ſtrong ſenſations, when under any violent affection of the mind, and when they are obliged to retire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, to enjoy ſome ſecret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or to feaſt upon their ſorrow.</p>
               <p>In a more continual application, the mind is affected with a ſtupor, or a kind of ebriety, the power of the ſoul on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of voluntary motion is diminiſhed, and the will loſes its empire over the body.</p>
               <p n="61">LXI. How great is the power likewiſe which the imagination has over the body! How ſingular the relation between this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoul and our organs!</p>
               <p>It is by this that a good mimic affects the ſuſceptible ſpectator, and makes him follow his motions, his geſtures, his actions mechanically, juſt as if his body were ſubject to be moved by the motions of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0658602402:56"/>It is by this the idea of delicate meats ſets the organs of taſte in motion, and, as it is commonly expreſſed, makes the mouth water. It is by this we experience that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable ſenſation, which we feel when we are touched even on thoſe parts which are the leaſt ſenſible, with deſign to excite titillation. It is the imagination, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by voluptuous ideas and images, or by the ſight of beauty, quickens the pulſe, increaſes the luſtre of the eye, excites ſtrong emotions in the organs of pleaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">The erection of the <hi>penis</hi> in man, and of the <hi>Clytoris</hi> in woman, are not voluntary motions. This mechaniſm of the parts abſolutely depends on the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: how many men are languid and impotent in the company of a woman, for whom they have no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; notwithſtanding every effort of the will, and ſometimes every aid of art!</note>, and cauſes palpitation of the heart.</p>
               <p>It is this, which in love kindles our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, produces on the lips of lovers that ſenſation of a lambent flame, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies their kiſſes, and renders their touch ſimilar to that of fire.</p>
               <p>It is this, which cauſes that tremor the lover experiences at the approaching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>It is this which, in the ardour of youth,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0658602402:57"/>gratiſies the voluptuouſneſs of deſire, in our dreams.</p>
               <p>But the power of the imagination is not confined to any particular organ, it is extended over the whole body. There have been convulſioniſts, who, by the help of a warm imagination, have raiſed themſelves by degrees to fury: their eyes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, the face disfigured by a violent contraction of its muſcles, the mouth foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all their members convulſed.</p>
               <p>However great this power which ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination has over the body may be, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have fancied it much greater than it really is. Not content with the prodigies of nature, they have attributed to it others, which are merely ideal.</p>
               <p>Led aſide, on one hand, by appearances; on the other, by the love of the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, like the ſtupid vulgar, they have adopted ridiculous prejudices, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their pens in defending them.</p>
               <p>We are told of a pregnant woman in Germany, who being ſtruck with the ſight of a picture of John Baptiſt, which hung in her bed-chamber, was afterwards delivered of an infant with its whole body hairy, and ſome phyſiologiſts, treating
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0658602402:58"/>this abſurdity as an aſſured fact, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the imagination could change the form of the ſolids, the features of the countenance, and the colour of the ſkin.</p>
               <p>This opinion was implicitly believed, and is at preſent univerſally received. From thence it is pretended, that whatever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the mother, affects the foetus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; that the affections of the ſoul of the one, act on the body of the other; to this energy are atributed the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of children to their parents, thoſe blemiſhes on the ſkin, and all thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous productions wherein nature appears to have forgotten the wiſdom of her own laws. They even carry their love of the marvellous ſo far as to aſſert, that the foetus bears the real marks and repreſentation of the longings of the mother, as of fruits and the like which ſhe may have eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired. But if we attentively examine theſe marks and blemiſhes, theſe pretended ſigns of the mother's diſtempered imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we ſhall perceive them to be only ſanguineſtains, and yellow or reddiſh ſpots<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe marks are always yellow or of a red or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let colour, tints which the blood naturally gives to the ſkin; when it enters in too great quantity into its vaſcular texture, and when it is more or leſs fluid, thick, or bilious, and likewiſe according to its mixture with the nervous fluid, or ſome other of the liquors of the body.</note>,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0658602402:59"/>more or leſs ſtrongly expreſſed, produced by ſome change in the texture of the ſkin. <q>Theſe ſpots have aſſuredly ſome figure; becauſe every ſpot muſt have one, and this figure muſt neceſſarily bear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to ſomething: but they have neither the form of any fruit, nor that of any object which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could deſire.</q> I have ſeen many ſuch pretended repreſentations of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's longings, but could never obſerve in them any thing more.</p>
               <p>By inveſtigating the cauſes of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, we ſhall find, as I have already remarked, that erroneous obſervations only could have given birth thereto. Not only the facts are falſe, but even ſuppoſing they were true, they cannot be produced by the cauſes to which they have been attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay, to prove this, that as our ſenſations reſemble not their objects, it is impoſſible that deſire can produce phyſical
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0658602402:60"/>repreſentations of thoſe objects; I have more convincing proofs to adduce.</p>
               <p>The ſoul affects the body undoubtedly in every paſſion, and always differently, according to the diverſity of its emotions; but it has been evidently demonſtrated, that the ſoul has no influence on the body, but by the nervous fluid; that this power over the body is reduced to the dilating or contracting our ſolids, to the accelerating or retarding the oſcillatory motion of the organs of circulation in different degrees, ſometimes even ſo as to deſtroy the motion of the whole machine; and that it has no other power over the fluid of the nerves, but to alter its quality and deprave it, that is, to render it cauſtic or deſtroy its ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Now the empire of the ſoul over the body which it inhabits, being thus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, can it be more extenſive over a body to which it is not ſo cloſely united? For it is well known, that the <hi>foetus</hi> has no direct or immediate communication with the mother; whilſt it is in the womb, it is incloſed within membranes, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here not to the <hi>uterus</hi> in the firſt months of pregnancy, nor is their adheſion very great when pregnancy is farther advanced.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0658602402:61"/>The placenta being connected to the uterus by papillae on the external part of the membranes inſerted into the ſmall fora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina of this organ and joined by a mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous matter, which poſſeſſes ſo ſmall a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of adheſion, that it ſcarcely <hi>appends</hi> to the matrix; the <hi>foetus</hi> therefore, in ſome reſpects, is intirely independent of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>It has been for a long time believed, that the blood of the mother paſſes into the body of the <hi>foetus,</hi> by means of the <hi>placenta</hi> and <hi>funis umbilicalis;</hi> it has been ſuppoſed likewiſe, that the blood veſſels of the uterus open into theſe foramina, and the veſſels of the placenta into theſe papillae, and that their veſſels communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with each other. But experience has convinced us of the error of this opinion; for, by injecting the arteries of the <hi>funis umbilicalis,</hi> the liquor injected wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns by the veins, nor does the leaſt part of it eſcape into thoſe parts, with which they are ſuppoſed to communicate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we may eaſily detract theſe papillae from their foramina, without producing any efflux of blood, either from the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus or the placenta, there being diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0658602402:62"/>from one to the other a lacteal fluid only, which ſerves for nouriſhment to the foetus.</p>
               <p>The foetus therefore has nothing in common with the mother but this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive lymph. They have diſtinct and ſeparate organs and functions; nor has the mother any influence over the foetus, but by means of this liquor. Every alteration of this nutritive, received from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is therefore communicated to the foetus: if it be corrupt, the ſolids and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids of the foetus are ſo likewiſe; but the fluids of the mother cannot otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, It is not therefore to the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the mother that we muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thoſe reſemblances, thoſe mutilations, thoſe duplicities of part, thoſe cutaneous blemiſhes which infants bring with them into the world, and which have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly regarded as true repreſentations of the depraved appetites of women, during pregnancy.</p>
               <p n="62">LXII. Let us conclude with one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant obſervation. If we compare the power of the different faculties of the ſoul over the body, we ſhall be convinced, that this power is not equal in every one:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0658602402:63"/>that of ſenſibility is much greater than that of the underſtanding, and this much greater than that of the will. If the powers of theſe faculties be not equally great, ſo neither are they equally exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Thoſe of ſenſibility and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are univerſal; they extend not only to the nervous fibres, but alſo to the fibrillae of which they are compoſed, that is, to the organs of ſenſe and thoſe of motion: the empire of the will, on the contrary, is confined to this latter, ſince thoſe two faculties can augment or extinguiſh our vigour, whilſt the will can only extend our organs and contract our muſcles.</p>
               <p>Such is in general the influence of the ſoul on the body, and of the body on the ſoul; ſuch the reciprocal relations of thoſe two ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>Although theſe relations are very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, many of them have eſcaped obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and of thoſe who have obſerved any, the greater number have been content with only obſerving them. Some philoſophers have attempted in vain to account for theſe phenomena: others, diſguſted at the ill ſucceſs of the former, have regarded them as impenetrable myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0658602402:64"/>ſo that every one is ſatisfied at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with ſimply obſerving and admiring this influence; they cry it up as prodigy, as if we were prohibited to paſs beyond the line which thoſe ſages have drawn; they likewiſe attribute their ill ſucceſs to the nature of the diſcovery, rather than to the erroneous methods which they have employed in purſuit of it.</p>
               <p>After the vain efforts of ſo many great geniuſes, notwithſtanding ſo great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of prejudices, and the ridicule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from ſuch an undertaking, I will venture to attempt the explanation of theſe myſteries, enter this dark laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, ſound this immenſe abyſs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light into thoſe regions of darkneſs: I ſhall aſſign the reaſons of this prodigious influence of the ſoul on the body, and of the body on the ſoul, diſplay the unknown principles of their relations, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the laws of theſe phenomena; in a word, reduce to fixed principles a ſcience, wherein every thing is yet hypothetic, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and myſterious.</p>

            <head>BOOK IV. WHEREIN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL ON THE BODY, AND OF THE BODY ON THE SOUL, IS ACCOUNTED FOR.</head>
            <p>THE union of the ſoul with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſubject of much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for in what manner can two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſo different from each other, be united? How can matter act upon the mind, or the mind upon matter? This is a myſtery impenetrable to human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Who is ſo preſumptuous as to undertake the explanation? Human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can never conceive the firſt principles of this intimate union, of this primitive correſpondence of the ſoul with the body: let us not ſeek to know after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner two beings, ſo different in their nature and properties, can act on each other; we muſt admit the fact ſimply, ſince it is unqueſtionable, but the cauſe is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0658602402:66"/>Yet theſe different ſubſtances have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular reciprocal relations, and theſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelves muſt needs have cauſes and principles. Theſe principles, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unknown, I endeavour to diſcover and demonſtrate; thoſe relations, hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and incomprehenſible, I attempt to account for.</p>
            <p>This ſubject appears at firſt ſight incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more difficult than thoſe we have treated of already: in theſe we arrive at truth, by a direct and ſhort way; in the other, on the contrary, concerning which we have hitherto only vague and abſurd conjectures, and where demonſtration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be impoſſible, we may paſs from hypotheſis to hypotheſis, and blindly purſue truth in the ocean of opinions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever attaining it. Yet this is not ſo difficult a taſk as it appears. The influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſoul on the body, and of the body on the ſoul, being invariably the ſame, in the ſame circumſtances, in every individual, and the relations of theſe two ſubſtances being ſimilar, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effects of cauſes which operate in a fixed and invariable manner. As the phenomena are ſubordinate to certain
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0658602402:67"/>laws, to diſcover thoſe laws we muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the effects to the cauſe, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chain of the principal phenomena, collecting ſimilar facts, comparing and examining them, ſelecting the properties they poſſeſs in common, from thoſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to each. Only by this method we can arrive at thoſe cauſes; without it, the mind wanders in darkneſs, perpetually fluctuating between prejudice and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ignorant of the principles of things, and ever confounding the opinions of men with the laws of nature. Such is the method I ſhall purſue in the inveſtigation of the cauſes of the reciprocal influence of the ſoul and body. I ſhall therefore collect the chief phenomena, compare them, ſelect thoſe which are ſimilar, and endeavour to preſent to the mind a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of analogous facts in a ſingle point of view. I ſhall likewiſe attempt to diſcover their identity, and the cauſe of their analogy; and finally, draw from the aſſemblage of theſe different combinations, light ſufficient to inveſtigate the cauſes and laws of the admirable harmony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting betwixt the ſoul and the body,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0658602402:68"/>ſo as to conduct us to the important know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Man.</p>
            <p>Theſe topics being ſo complicated and ſo different in their nature, I ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a kind of neceſſity to pay my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal attention to the great and leading ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, reducing the phenomena to ſome general heads, avoiding to deſcend into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute particulars, a labour as troubleſome to a writer as it is unprofitable to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who are thus continually put to the trouble of collecting them, whilſt, after all, they receive only confuſed and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ideas of the ſubject. Beſides, the mind fatigued with a multitude of objects, loſes itſelf in the perplexity of its own thoughts, and throws a darkneſs on that which it endeavours to elucidate. I ſhall therefore confine myſelf to the ſolution of the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, collecting them into one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral point of view, diſregarding thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiae or particular queſtions, which might cauſe me to loſe ſight of the main ſcope, interrupt the thread of the ſubject, and rob demonſtration of its evidence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall likewiſe endeavour to preſent my ideas in an order equally eaſy to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and intereſting to purſue.</p>

               <p>WHEN the ſoul is affected by any ſentiment, it inſtantly affects the body, always in the ſame manner in every individual, and ever differently according to the nature of its emotions.</p>
               <p>The ſoul has no direct power over our corporeal organs; the ſoul and body are diſtinct beings, without any neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and are united by the nervous fluid only<note n="*" place="bottom">See the article on the ſtructure of the nerves, Book I.</note>. Thus, in whatſoever man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner theſe ſubſtances reciprocally affect each other, the ſoul never acts on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor the body on the ſoul, without the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0658602402:70"/>intervention of this fluid, and never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome impulſe being communicated by one to the other<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Art. on the action of the ſoul on the fluid of the nerves, Book I.</note>. On the impulſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to this fluid, on its different degrees of force, combined with the elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the fibres, and the different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans affected, depend the different pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena obſerved in the influence of the ſoul on the body. Let us apply this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the effects of the paſſions on our organs.</p>
               <p>In joy, the countenance acquires a more lively colour, the eyes ſparkle with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual luſtre, and the face wears a perpetual ſmile; a gentle emotion is felt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the heart and <hi>plexus nervoſi;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is more free, circulation more eaſy and quick; we receive freſh vigour, all the functions are more perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the whole body is full of life.</p>
               <p>As the joy is more violent, theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are more ſtrong; the arms, legs, head, every member is ſtrongly agitated; the body can ſcarcely contain itſelf.</p>
               <p>The vivacity of the complexion, the luſtre of the eyes, the liberty and force of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0658602402:71"/>the circulation, the freedom of reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the vigour of the whole body, clearly evince, that in joy the ſoul forcibly impels a large quantity of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion. This impulſe of the fluid of the nerves into theſe organs, occaſioning a ſmall intumeſcence of the muſcular fibres<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe fibres are the particular organs of motion, as we have already explained when treating of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm of the human body, under the Art. on the ſtructure of the muſcles, Book I.</note>, and ſlightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the fluid which is contained in the fibrillae whereof they are compoſed, gives them the whole of their organic elaſticity; yet cauſes not the leaſt degree of rigidity. Hence the muſcular motion is ample and ſtrong, the heart and the arteries forcibly impel the blood into the ſmalleſt capillaries, and thus communicate to the ſkin that ſlight intumeſcence, which then ſo greatly conduces to beauty, and to that clear and lively colour, which is ſo greatly orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. The humours of the eye receive a freſh ſupply of ſpirits, and their tunics are more fully diſtended, whereby they reflect a greater quantity of rays, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire greater luſtre. In the muſcles of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0658602402:72"/>the cheeks, this impulſe is principally to be ſeen; being them ſupplied with a larger quantity of the nervous fluid, they gently contract, and with the help of the lips expreſs an agreeable ſmile.</p>
               <p>But if the fluid of the nerves, inſtead of cauſing a ſlight intumeſcence of the muſcular fibres, ſhould violently precipitate itſelf in great quantity, as it happens in extreme joy; the fibres, being then too greatly diſtended, cannot re-act, but they oppoſe a too great reſiſtance to the elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the fluid contained in their fibrillae. Theſe fibrillae are therefore in a ſtate of rigidity, their fluid is inactive, and the entire organ without organic elaſticity.</p>
               <p>Hence the reaſon why exceſs of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſtupifies the ſenſes, affects the body with languor, and even deſtroys the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our organs, when this ſtate of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity is extreme.</p>
               <p>But in moderate joy, although the ſoul is not affected with ſufficient force to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a rigidity of the fibres, theſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul produce no durable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on the body; this ſingular vigour, this flouriſhing ſtate of the machine is of no long continuance, and languor imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0658602402:73"/>ſucceeds. This is eaſy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, however ſtrange theſe phenomena may appear: for the vigour we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whilſt affected with joy, ſprings only from the ſtrong influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion; this fluid ceaſes to be determined thereto, when the ſoul ceaſes to experience theſe agreeable emotions; the fibres thus diſtended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and collapſe when the fluid with which they were diſtended is diſſipated, and our muſcles are without either tone or elaſticity.</p>
               <p>It is by a ſimilar mechaniſm that the handling of the breaſts of females deprives them of their globular ſwell; it excites a voluptuous emotion in the ſoul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the imagination, which determines the ſpirits thither in great abundance, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends their fibres, increaſes their volume, and gives them greater firmneſs; but as this determination of ſpirits is not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, if the handling be repeated, when this ſupply has ceaſed, the breaſts preſently collapſe and loſe their ſolidity.</p>
               <p>When the ſoul is overwhelmed with ſadneſs, the complexion becomes wan and pallid, the eyes dull, a tenſion is felt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0658602402:74"/>about the diaphragm, the head inclines for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the arms hang down, unable to ſupport their own weight, the whole body is affected with languor, we ſigh, the eyes are ſuffuſed with tears, ſighs are repeated, and tears flow in abundance.</p>
               <p>The greater the affliction, the more evident are theſe its effects; there is a point to which this paſſion is capable of arriving, and where its violence ſometimes extinguiſhes the lamp of life.</p>
               <p>If in joy the ſoul gives a greater elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity to the muſcles, by determining thereto the fluid of the nerves with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity and in abundance; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in ſadneſs it appears to relax the ſame organs, cauſing them to collapſe, by withdrawing the energetic fluid.</p>
               <p>But this is nothing but appearance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; all effects of the ſoul on the body in this paſſion, as in all the others, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the influx of the nervous fluid, determined into different ducts. In joy, the fluid is impelled from the brain into the cavities of the muſcular fibres. In ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is impelled into the fibrillae of which theſe fibres are formed, and which we have ſhewn to be the proper organs of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0658602402:75"/>ſenſe. In this caſe the nervous fluid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the fibrillae, increaſes their diameter, compreſſes that of the fibres, and deſtroys the equilibrium, cauſing it to incline to the fibrillae: hence only a ſmall quantity flows at that time into the organs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even that can have but little action.</p>
               <p>Hence proceeds the weakneſs of the muſcles, the languid action of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, the paleneſs of the countenance, the diminiſhed vivacity of the eyes, and the ſtupor then affecting the whole body.</p>
               <p>Theſe are however only the effects of a moderate impulſe; when this impulſe is violent, it occaſions an extreme rigidity of the muſcular fibres<note n="*" place="bottom">This rigidity may likewiſe be produced by the irritating quality of the nervous fluid, contracted dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this paſſion. But it is evident that nature does not take this method: for in ſadneſs, relaxation immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etely ſollows this rigidity; whereas the irritating qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the nervous fluid would have produced a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent rigidity.</note>; this rigidity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly produces a total ceſſation of the functions of the body, and conſequently death.</p>
               <p>But to conceive the effects of ſadneſs properly, we muſt diſtinguiſh thoſe which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0658602402:76"/>accompany the impulſe of the nervous fluid into our organs, from thoſe which ſucceed it.</p>
               <p>The rigidity of the muſcular fibres is the immediate effect of this impulſe, but to this rigidity immediately ſucceeds an equal degree of relaxation. The univerſal tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor affecting us upon hearing of any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, the paleneſs of countenance, the difficulty of reſpiration, the oppreſſion of the diaphragm, concentrated circulation, and the general ſtupor of the whole body, are evidently the effects of a ſlight rigidity of the fibres. The feebleneſs of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the decayed luſtre of the eyes, the relaxation of the muſcles, the lax ſtate of the ſkin, and the languor of all the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the body, are the conſequences of that inelaſticity which neceſſary ſucceeds this rigidity. Hence it appears, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity and relaxation are the cauſes of all the phenomena produced by the influence of the ſoul on the body in ſadneſs.</p>
               <p>Hence Man, in violent affliction, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to extreme weakneſs; hence ſilence and conſternation are the language of the ſoul when ſtrongly, affected; as are cries and tears, when moderately worked upon.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0658602402:77"/>Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes ſtupent.</q>
               <p>Hence extreme pain deprives us of ſenſe, of motion, and of life itſelf.</p>
               <p>Although the ſoul affect the whole body in different paſſions, yet it affects not all its organs equally: at one time it acts moſt upon theſe, at another upon thoſe; but the ſoul principally exerciſes its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the <hi>plexus cardiaci.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe plexus are united to the moſt conſiderable blood veſſels, ſuch as the trunks of the veſſels of the ſtomach, liver, ſpleen, heart, and meſentery, which they line with their ramifications. They have likewiſe a direct connexion with the brain and organs of ſenſe.</p>
               <p>In ſadneſs, when theſe plexus are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently contracted, they forcibly compreſs the trunks of the blood veſſels which they ſurround, cauſing the blood to be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, and even occaſioning a total ſtoppage of the circulation.</p>
               <p>Hence that compreſſion of the heart, that preſſure about the diaphragm, thoſe ſyncopes accompanying the paroxyſms of extreme ſadneſs, and hence even death, which ſometimes enſues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0658602402:78"/>But when theſe ramifications of the nervous plexus are only ſlightly contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as in moderate joy, they ſlightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the veſſels round which they are wound, but principally the veins, whoſe coats oppoſe the leaſt reſiſtance; hereby the blood in circulation is ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, particularly in its return to the heart.</p>
               <p>Hence the emotions we experience in joy in the region of the diaphragm, and that livelineſs of complexion which always accompanies it.</p>
               <p>When the emotions produced on the <hi>plexus nervoſi</hi> have a certain degree of force, they communicate to the diaphragm, to which theſe plexus are united by the diaphragmatic nerve, a tranſient convulſive motion which produces burſts of laughter: for laughter, which is a ſound ſuddenly interrupted, and frequently reſumed, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produced by a tremor of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm. This motion of the diaphragm affects the lungs, which it precipitately elevates and depreſſes; every time the lungs are depreſſed, the air is expelled through the mouth, with a certain noiſe;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0658602402:79"/>this is that ſound of the voice, which is ſo often repeated in laughter.</p>
               <p>That ſudden ſtarting likewiſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conſtriction, which we experience when we firſt begin to think of ſome evil affecting us, is produced by the contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diaphragm, which participates of the nature of the ſpaſm affecting the <hi>plexus nervoſi.</hi> This conſtriction of the diaphragm raiſes the lungs, and occaſions that ſtrong expiration, called a <hi>ſigh.</hi> Whilſt the ſoul continues to think upon any ſorrowful ſubject, it communicates different motions to the plexus, and ſighs are frequently repeated. But when new impulſes ſucceed immediately one after the other, the air ruſhes ſuddenly, and by intervals, into the lungs, produces fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent expirations, and every expiration occaſions a ſound ſtronger than ſighing: this ſound frequently repeated is what is commonly termed <hi>ſobbing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the ſpaſms begin gradually to diminiſh, the air is not expelled ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily from the lungs, expiration is repeated at greater intervals, and produces a louder ſound, called <hi>groaning;</hi> for a groan is only a continued ſob. Finally, when relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0658602402:80"/>ſucceeds to theſe ſpaſms, tears begin to flow.</p>
               <p>Tears are lymph, diſtilled from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymal glands, ſituated in the orbit above the leſſer canthus of the eye.</p>
               <p>Each gland has ſix or ſeven ducts, which paſs between the membranes of the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and open into one common orifice near the <hi>cilia.</hi> From this orifice diſtills a ſaline lymph, which is abſorbed by the <hi>puncta lachrymalia,</hi> and diſcharged by its proper duct into the noſe. But theſe glands expreſs not this liquor till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to relax after contraction: hence is the reaſon why moderate grief cauſes tears to flow, and why exceſſive grief ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends them.</p>
               <p>We commonly regard tears as a ſign of ſadneſs, but without reaſon. They are the effects of every paſſion which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts our fibres; fear, anger, and even joy excite them, as well as ſadneſs and pity.</p>
               <p>In fear, as in ſadneſs, there is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal tremor, a conſtriction of the heart, pallor of the countenance, ſinking of the muſcles, relaxation of the ſkin, imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0658602402:81"/>and ſtupor. Theſe ſimilar effects are produced by the ſame mechaniſm.</p>
               <p>Hence lovers, overpowered by their good fortune, remain inactive during the night of their marriage, and recover not their vigour till their aſtoniſhment is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated.</p>
               <p>Hence extreme fear ſuſpends tears, and moderate grief abundantly excites them.</p>
               <p>Hence fear chills us, ſtupifies our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and arreſts our motion.</p>
               <p>When fear is extreme, the nervous fluid, being violently precipitated into the fibrillae which form the muſcular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, deſtroys the equilibrium between the reſiſtance of theſe fibres and its action, interrupts the regularity of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of motion, and even at times diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all their functions.</p>
               <p>Hence that tremor and numbneſs, which deprives us of the uſe of our limbs: hence the reaſon why a rope-dancer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform thoſe feats at the heighth of thirty yards, which he performs with eaſe at the heighth of fifteen feet: why ſome perſons walk without danger over the roofs of houſes, whilſt aſleep; whereas they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0658602402:82"/>would have fallen had they been awake, and ſenſible of their danger.</p>
               <p>Hence the bird, which with its warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling chears the night in the ſpring ſeaſon, when it perceives the viper beneath, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively watching to devour it, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme tremor ſeizes its feeble organs, a languor deprives them of motion, till at length it can no longer ſupport itſelf, but falls, as if by enchantment, into the open jaws of that deadly reptile.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that the effects of ſadneſs on the body are ſimilar to thoſe of fear; there is however this difference between them. In fear we almoſt always perceive a palpitation of heart, which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſadneſs. This difference is wholly to be attributed to the greater or leſs interval, which paſſes in theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, between the different impulſes of the nervous fluid into our organs, and to the greater or leſs impetuoſity of theſe impulſes.</p>
               <p>When fear is moderate, the ſoul is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively affected by the ſame ſentiment at very ſhort intervals, and at every repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this ſentiment it impels into the nerves (particularly into the plexus ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſi)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0658602402:83"/>a freſh ſupply of fluid, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a ſlight ſpaſm; the blood veſſels are likewiſe ſucceſſively obſtructed by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifications of the plexus which ſurround them, and the circulation is at intervals interrupted. When the ſpaſm ceaſes, the blood is violently impelled into the heart, which then becomes overcharged; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the circulation is rendered irregular, and the pulſe feeble and intermitting. Hence proceeds the cauſe of this tenſion at the region of the diaphragm, and of this palpitation of the heart.</p>
               <p>In love the eyes gliſter, the complexion is more lively, we feel ſtrong agitations in the organs of pleaſure, a heat in the region of the heart, and an increaſe of vigour in the whole body.</p>
               <p>From the analogy between the effects of love and thoſe of joy, it is evident, that in love the ſoul abundantly ſupplies the organs of motion, and principally the <hi>plexus ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſi</hi> with the nervous fluid, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the plexus with which the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are interwoven: for the heat, which we then experience about the heart, is produced by the arterial blood collected in this part, by the ſlight contraction of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0658602402:84"/>ramifications of the plexus which invelope theſe veſſels.</p>
               <p>The ſoul very ſingularly affects the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of pleaſure, in love; it even appears, that theſe organs are the principal ſcene of the effects of this paſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe parts have, it is well known, an intimate corre ſpondence with the <hi>ſemilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar plexus,</hi> one of the <hi>plexus cardiaci,</hi> by means of the ſpermatic veſſels; the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fluid is abundantly ſupplied thereto, animates the <hi>muſculi erectores penis,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſtrong agitations in theſe parts, and gives the whole organ that tenſion, that turgidneſs, ſo neceſſary to the deſign of nature, and to the pleaſures of love.</p>
               <p>In friendſhip the ſoul affects the body in the ſame manner as in love; the organs of pleaſure however experience no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular emotion; except this, the ſtate of the body is equal, and its mechaniſm is the ſame.</p>
               <p>Hatred produces effects contrary to thoſe of love. When that paſſion is extreme, at the ſight of the object of our averſion we feel a ſudden tremor of the whole body, a weight on the diaphragm, a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por of all our organs, and a tenſion of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0658602402:85"/>the muſcles of the face, paleneſs covers the countenance and the eyes wander.</p>
               <p>Theſe effects are analogous to thoſe of fear, and are produced by the ſame cauſes.</p>
               <p>Hence uglineſs renders us impotent; whilſt beauty, on the contrary, inſpires new vigour in the combats of love.</p>
               <p>In the compound paſſions, the influence of the ſoul on the body is the ſame as in the ſimple. This may alſo be affirmed of its mechaniſm. Hence the effect of theſe paſſions is the ſum of the particular effects of the different ſentiments which unite and are confounded therein.</p>
               <p>But theſe paſſions muſt produce differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent effects, according to the relative force of theſe different ſentiments.</p>
               <p>Hence in terror, when fear predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, we experience all the effects of this paſſion, that numbneſs which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of the uſe of our ſenſes, that languor which brings us back to the ſtate of infancy, that ſtupor which diſorders the action of our organs, and ſometimes prevails ſo far as to deſtroy it. When it is moderate, its impreſſions on the body are very ſlight, nor can we diſtinguiſh them from thoſe of the deſire of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0658602402:86"/>the ſoul at that time impels the fluid of the nerves into the organs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in joy, increaſes their vigour, and augments their elaſticity.</p>
               <p>Hence that force which is produced by the ſight of danger, the laſt efforts of a ſenſible and intelligent being, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to defend life, or aſſure his own happineſs.</p>
               <p>Rage produces likewiſe different effects on the body, according to the nature of the ſentiment then reigning in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>In ſentiments of hatred and ſadneſs, which are the moſt early in their effects on the body, the ſoul forcibly impels the nervous fluid into the fibrillae of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres, extremely dilates their tube, contracts that of the fibres, and renders them ſomewhat rigid. Hence the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the veſſels is diminiſhed, and the circulation ſo imperfect, that the blood is not impelled to the arterial capillaries; hence the pallor of countenance and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por of the limbs. The <hi>plexus nervoſi</hi> are likewiſe violently contracted, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the diaphragmatic nerve; hence that preſſure at the region of the heart, that weight which then ſo grievouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0658602402:87"/>the ſtomach, and nearly deſtroys reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration.</p>
               <p>But theſe effects are not of a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; to the ſentiments of ſadneſs and of hatred preſently ſucceeds a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge, which afterwards reigns ſingly in the ſoul; the nervous fluid is then forcibly impelled into the muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fibres, whereby their diameter is greatly enlarged; this influx likewiſe compreſſes the fluid of the fibrillae, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments their elaſticity and envigorates the muſcles.</p>
               <p>By the ſame principle, the nervous fluid produces in the vaſcular ſyſtem an aptitude to the moſt powerful oſcillation; the blood is thereby impelled to the extremities of the cutaneous capillaries, and into the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of motion, which it renders ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of vigorous action: hence the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous motions of rage, and the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious force of phrenetics. Such is the manner in which nature, who has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between individuals different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of power, ſometimes renders weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs equal to ſtrength by means of deſpair.</p>
               <p>This influx of the fluid of the nerves into the fibres produces in the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0658602402:88"/>plexus nervoſi, eſpecially in the ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wound round the trunks of the veins, a ſmall degree of rigidity; theſe veſſels are thereby ſomewhat obſtructed, and the return of the blood to the heart is attended with difficulty, whilſt it is carried from the centre to the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with its uſual freedom: the veſſels are thereby greatly diſtended at the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body; whence ſprings that redneſs of countenance, that fire of the eyes which ever accompany rage.</p>
               <p>As this influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion is inſtantaneous, theſe organs are not affected with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of tenſion equally violent or equally durable; the eaſe and perfection of their motion is thereby neceſſarily deſtroyed: hence the tremor of the whole body, the hoarſe, loud and interrupted ſpeech, ever obſerved in anger.</p>
               <p>The paſſions, which are founded on ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, add force to the natural ſtrength of Man; but this additional vigour is only momentary, and rage, as the other violent paſſion, having elevated Man for a few moments above himſelf, reduces him to an equal degree in the oppoſite extreme.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0658602402:89"/>On one part, weakening the fibres by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſtenſion and contraction, it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes their primitive elaſticity; on the other, exhauſting by reiterated efforts that fluid which is the principle of vigour, it affects the body with extreme weakneſs, which deſtroys both the power and the will to make any future effort.</p>
               <p>I leave to the curious the examination of the effects of the ſoul on the body in the other paſſions, the explanation is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and eaſy, by purſuing the principles here eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The paſſions produce very ſingular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on the body, and diſplay themſelves by ſome outward mark or other to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive obſerver; but they are no where ſo apparent as in the countenance. In the paſſions, the face is the living tablet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every emotion of the ſoul is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with equal energy and force.</p>
               <p>By removing the teguments of the face, we obſerve it to be compoſed of a great number of ſmall muſcles, which adjoin to and unite every part by their tendons. Theſe muſcles form all the expreſſions of phyſiognomy, and diſplay every affection of the ſoul. The repoſe of all the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0658602402:90"/>expreſſes ſerenity of mind, and their different motions, its different paſſions.</p>
               <p>In the ſame paſſion, the ſame muſcles are always contracted, and that in the ſame manner in every individual. When the ſoul paſſes rapidly from one ſentiment to another, the features they form by their contraction are ſucceſſively effaced; but when the ſoul is habitually reſigned to any one paſſion, the features are conſtant, and become the characteriſtics of the phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</p>
               <p>Every part of the face contributes to the beauty of the whole, but every part contributes not to its expreſſion. Beauty conſiſts in harmony and regularity of parts; phyſiognomy in their motion. The noſe, though the moſt protuberant feature of the face, contributes the leaſt to phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, it having very little motion. For the ſame reaſon the ears, the chin and the temples contribute leſs to phyſiognomy than to beauty. On the contrary, the lips, the mouth, the cheeks, the eye-lids and the eye brows, conduce much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by the different appearances they aſſume. But no part is more expreſſive than the eyes; in theſe admirable organs,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0658602402:91"/>the ſoul principally appears; in theſe it expreſſes the moſt tumultuous emotions, and the moſt agreeable ſentiments; in theſe it expreſſes them in all their force, in all their purity, and diſplays, by the moſt energetic lineaments, the image of its ſecret agitations. The cauſe of this phenomenon may, without difficulty, be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>As the eye is formed of many nerves, or rather, as it is only a large nerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and as it abounds with nervous fluid, to this organ therefore the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſoul muſt be principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. It being likewiſe very conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the brain, and moreover dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous, the power of the ſoul muſt be there leſs weak and more apparent: hence it is evident, that the paſſions will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in this organ with the greateſt energy.</p>
               <p>The power of the underſtanding over the body is exerciſed by the ſame mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm as that of ſenſibility; that is, ever by an impulſe communicated to the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fluid. By determining a greater quantity of this fluid to the nervous fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, it produces a greater degree of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0658602402:92"/>thus it happens to all our muſcles, to the <hi>plexus cardiaci,</hi> and eſpecially to the <hi>meninges</hi> during meditation. This increaſe of the organic elaſticity of the fibres ſtrengthens the oſcillatory motion of the veſſels, and renders the circulation more rapid. When meditation is deep in the extreme, this tenſion of the fibres is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme likewiſe, and the circulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes vehement; the contraction of the nervous plexus enveloping the blood veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, at that time arreſts the arterial and venous blood: whence ariſes that heat and thoſe anxieties, which ever accompany profound application.</p>
               <p>By impelling a greater quantity of fluid into the nervous fibres, the ſoul renders them more ſenſible, and prepares our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to contract at the ſlighteſt impreſſion. Such is the method imagination uſes to ſtrengthen our ſenſations.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſes that intolerable ſenſation which is produced by the touch of others, with a view to excite titillation. Hence is the cauſe of that tenſion of the organs of pleaſure, which ariſes from the ſight or idea of laſcivious objects, and of thoſe emiſſions which are experienced when the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0658602402:93"/>influx of the nervous fluid into the <hi>muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi erectores penis,</hi> and the <hi>veſiculoe ſeminales</hi> is very rapid.</p>
               <p>This fluid, when determined to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of digeſtion and ſalival glands, by contracting them, excites the ſecretion of ſaliva and gaſtric lymph. Such is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by which the imagination, from the ſight of delicate meats, occaſions the ſame motion in the organ of digeſtion, as when they are ſupplied with the aliments themſelves.</p>
               <p>But if at any time the imagination im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel this fluid into the muſcular fibres, it at other times determines it to their fibrillae, produces there a degree of rigidity, which deſtroys the action of the muſcles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders the whole body.</p>
               <p>Hence thoſe ſhiverings, that imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſometimes render us unable to conſummate the work of love.</p>
               <p>The paſſions not only diſplay themſelves in the countenance, not only dilate and contract the fibres; but the arms, the legs, the head, nay, the whole body, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume different poſtures, according to the different ſentiments affecting us. By ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the ſame ſentiments, actors and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0658602402:94"/>communicate to us their port, their geſture, and their action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The influx of the nervous fluid into the fibres of the nerves and muſcles or into their fibrilloe, a ſmall degree of tenſion, rigidity or relaxation of theſe fibres or of theſe fibrilloe, are therefore the true and ſole cauſes of all the phenomena of the influence of the ſoul on the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for what reaſon does the ſoul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the nervous fluid into the muſcular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, rather than into their fibrillae? Why into one organ or muſcle rather than into another? Why in ſhame does the head incline forwards, in ſadneſs and in languor, on either ſide? Why in love do the organs of pleaſure experience ſtrong emotions excluſively of others? Why does imagination, excited by the ideas of exquiſite meats, affect the organs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion rather than thoſe of love? By what means does the ſoul, in the different paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, impel the nervous fluid into any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nerve, any particular muſcle, or any particular organ excluſively; whilſt every part of the body partakes of nerves, which are common to all, whoſe fibres are ever expoſed to the influence of this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0658602402:95"/>fluid which inceſſantly pervades them? Theſe ſingular relations between particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faculties of the ſoul and certain organs of the body; this ſurpriſing correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<note n="*" place="bottom">Another phenomenon equally ſurpriſing, which has not been more attended to than thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is the faculty, which the ſoul poſſeſſes unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by experience, of diſcerning whence it receives its ſenſations.</note>, which has been ſo little attended to, is to me an enigma, an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible myſtery, which I relinquiſh entirely to any one who is willing to undertake the ſolution of it, if it can be accompliſhed by the human mind.</p>
               <p>Let us here conclude with ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant obſervations on the influence of the ſoul on the body.</p>
               <p>Every different emotion of the ſoul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the <hi>plexus nervoſi,</hi> which appear to be the principal organ wherein the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exerciſe their power. There we feel that inexpreſſible anguiſh, which pity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites in the heart, when we hear the groans of the unfortunate, or the cries of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; there fear and terror intrude their terrible anxieties; there joy introduces its
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0658602402:96"/>ſweet tranſports, and there the ſoul leaves its moſt durable impreſſions<note n="*" place="bottom">The nervous fluid, impelled by the ſoul, is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated in great quantity into their narrow and delicate tubes, diſtends them, and ſometimes ruptures their coats, which are too weak to ſurmount its reſiſtance.</note>.</p>
               <p>All the paſſions domineer in the ſoul; but the body, particularly the <hi>plexus ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſi,</hi> is the wretched theatre of their conflict.</p>
               <p>Sentiment is only a tranſient emotion of the ſoul, which endures only whilſt the underſtanding is fixed on the object by which it was produced; ſentiment, when produced, is ſometimes ſo early extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it eſcapes attention.</p>
               <p>The ſoul poſſeſſes the power of fixing our ſentiments at pleaſure, it ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them in oppoſition to the will. When a paſſion is agreeable to us, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain its object excluſively, and the ſoul is delighted in its contemplation; let us then be ever ſo willing to attend to other objects, pleaſure conſtantly attaches us to this only; the love of happineſs, ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the mind, always determines it to that which adminiſters delight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0658602402:97"/>Thus the unhappy lover, ſeparated from his miſtreſs, looks languiſhingly around him, and inceſſantly engroſſed by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object, takes no intereſt in others: ſweetly melancholy, he ſeeks ſilence and ſolitude, where, without interruption and free from importunate cares, he indulges his delightful revery, and reſigns himſelf wholly to the contemplation of the object he loves.</p>
               <p>The will and the love of pleaſure, can fix any particular ſentiment in the ſoul; but when they fix none therein, when the mind chooſes to loſe ſight of importunate objects, and begins to neglect them, it is the phyſical cauſe which detains us with that upon which we are then engaged. It is the ſenſe of the impreſſion produced on our organs, and principally on the plexus nervoſi, which recalls us thereto. It is this which, amidſt ſports and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, calls back the unfortunate to their grief and tears.</p>
               <p>It is therefore only by aid of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions produced on theſe <hi>plexus,</hi> that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> tranſient emotions of the ſoul become permanent, that they acquire any duration in our hearts after their cauſes have ceaſed,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0658602402:98"/>that they conſume us, and continually prey on the mind, even in deſpite of ourſelves.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe by aid of the different impreſſions of ſentiments on the body, that contrary paſſions appear to be co-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Let us however obſerve, that as theſe impreſſions are produced in contrary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by oppoſite cauſes, they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed one by another; when, of the ſeries of different ſentiments to which the ſoul is reſigned, the laſt becomes the moſt powerful: but how ſtrong or how feeble ſoever theſe impreſſions may be, they mutually weaken each other. Hence we never obſerve, at one time, on the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy, the violent tranſports of joy, and the deſtructive languor of deſpair, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we frequently diſcover ſadneſs veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gentle ſmile.</p>

                     <p>The ſenſibility of the ſoul is ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to that of the body, and the ſenſations are ever more ſtrong at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant they are received from the object, than when remitted from the memory<note n="†" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. on the exerciſe of the memory.</note>. Hence it appears, that the moſt powerful artificial pleaſures, the moſt lively paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the imagination, muſt neceſſarily be weaker than the impreſſions of the ſenſes. However, when we compare the repreſentations of fancy with thoſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the brilliant paintings of love in the <hi>Adonis</hi> of <hi>Marini,</hi> with the merely phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pleaſures of that paſſion, we are much more ſtrongly affected by the former than by the latter.</p>
                     <p>Whence ariſes this phenomenon? It is not that the ſenſibility of the ſoul is more ſtrong than that of our organs, as might be inferred from theſe examples; but that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0658602402:106"/>the ſenſes, in their enjoyment, being ever confined to their objects, can neither add to, nor take from them; whilſt the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination being free in the choice of its colours and its lineaments, inceſſantly paſſes from object to object, ſelecting that which is moſt brilliant, and moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, and from thence forms its images, as the bee its honey from the moſt delicious parts of flowers. The lineaments which are diſperſed in ſenſual enjoyments, are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or rather concentrated in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary pleaſures, and acquire force from this concentration, as the rays of light collected in the focus of a mirror.</p>
                     <p>The paintings of imagination muſt therefore appear more powerful than the pleaſures of the ſenſes; although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their whole force from the ſenſations of the body.</p>

                     <head>Why <hi>MAN</hi> is more ſenſible to Pain than Pleaſure.</head>
                     <p>Painful ſenſations affect us incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more ſtrongly than the agreeable; for violent pain deſtroys all ſenſations of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but the moſt powerful ſenſation of pleaſure cannot ſilence a ſtrong ſenſation of pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0658602402:107"/>However ſurpriſing this phenomenon may appear, it is not difficult to aſſign the cauſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding we are ignorant of the mechaniſm of the ſenſations, it is however certain, that their force is ever propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the affection of the nervous fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of which their organs are formed. In the agreeable ſenſations, theſe fibres are ſlightly affected; it may be ſaid, that objects of pleaſure paſs only gently over them; whilſt, in painful ſenſations, the ſame fibres are violently compreſſed, are ever rendered extremely tenſe and often broken.</p>
                     <p>Hence Man is leſs ſenſible to pleaſure than pain; hence more ſtrongly affected by the repreſentation of Tartarus than by that of Elyſium; hence the attraction of pleaſure, the pleaſingneſs of hope, always yield to the fear of torment and to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of deſpair.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>There is a conſtant relation between the diſpoſition or humour of Man, and the conſtitution of the corporeal organs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0658602402:108"/>Is the body affected with diſeaſe? The ſoul is ſad Is the body in health? The ſoul is gay. Is the former in vigour? The latter is vivacious. Is that Ianguid? This is ſo too.</p>
                     <p>Sadneſs, gaiety, vivacity, languor, theſe diſpoſitions, theſe ſentiments, are experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſoul often when it is ignorant of their ſubject, ignorant even of their ſource. Like two harmonic machines, the ſoul conſtantly correſponds to the ſtate of the body; the ſame phenomenon is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at all times and in all places: the light does not more regularly follow the revolutions of the ſun, than the ſoul the revolutions of the body.</p>
                     <p>Let us explain this phenomenon.</p>
                     <p>Although the ſenſations be not the cauſe of the paſſions, and although no mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm whatever can produce in the heart a ſentiment of ſadneſs or of joy, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs a law of nature, that when ſome particular ſenſation is received, ſome particular ſentiment ſhould ariſe in the ſoul; that<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. origin of our ſentiments.</note> pleaſure ſhould excite joy, and pain ſadneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0658602402:109"/>Pleaſure and pain ſpring from three different ſources,</p>
                     <p>From external objects, by the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>From ideas, by thought.</p>
                     <p>From the internal parts of the body, by the general organs of feeling.</p>
                     <p>The agreeable and painful ſenſations which ariſe from the two firſt of theſe ſources, are momentary; becauſe the ſenſes are not always affected, nor is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conſtantly in exerciſe: but the ſoul conſtantly receives ſenſations from the third ſource, if it be only that of the ſtate of the body.</p>
                     <p>Joy and ſadneſs, ſentiments which have an immediate relation to agreeable and painful ſenſations, muſt therefore prevail in the ſoul in proportion as the one or the other of theſe ſenſations reſults from the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our organs.</p>
                     <p>The impreſſions of pleaſure and pain, which we receive from the two firſt ſources, are the cauſe of thoſe tranſient fits of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation and ſadneſs, which we ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experience, whoſe ſubject is ever known; thoſe, we receive from the laſt, are the cauſe of that gaiety and ſadneſs with which we are at all times more or leſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0658602402:110"/>affected, frequently imperceptibly to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but much oftener without our knowing their principle: theſe form the baſis of the humour of Man.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the body is in health, whilſt all the functions are perfectly performed, and the fluids circulate with freedom and eaſe, this motion of the fluids produces on the <hi>plexus nervoſi,</hi> which envelope the veſſels, an agreeable ſenſation, a ſlight and vague emotion, more eaſily ſelt than deſcribed: this ſenſation paſſes into the ſoul by the nerves: hence joy, which ſprings from pleaſure and inceſſantly accompanies it, muſt neceſſary ariſe therein together with this agreeable ſenſation. Thus gaiety and good humour are neceſſary attendants on health.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, are the functions of the animal machine diſordered? Are our fluids too denſe, too acrid, in too large or too ſmall a quantity? Is their circulation violent or difficult? The diſorder within, produces in the ſoul a diſagreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ever accompanied with ſadneſs.</p>
                     <p>When all the functions of the animal machine are eaſily performed, Man is gay;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0658602402:111"/>when with difficulty, he is melancholy and ſad.</p>
                     <p>When an eaſy or irregular performance of the functions is the natural ſtate of the body, we are gay or ſad by conſtitution. But as eaſy circulation reſults from the equilibrium between our fluids and ſolids; as this equilibrium may be eaſily deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a machine ſo complex and ſo feeble as the human body, inceſſantly expoſed to ſhocks from external objects, from the impulſe of fluids penetrating it in every part, often ſo pernicious in their nature, and almoſt always with ſo little proportion to its delicacy, it may be eaſily conceived, that the ſtate which produces gaiety, muſt ſeldom exiſt; but that which produces ſadneſs, very often.</p>
                     <p>That voluptuous ſenſation, which ariſes from the eaſy motion of the organs, is likewiſe much more reſtrained than the diſagreeable enſation which ſprings from a defect in their harmony. The former va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries very little, becauſe one cauſe only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it; the latter, on the contrary<note n="*" place="bottom">When this equilibrium is deſtroyed and the fluids prevail, the blood circulates with difficulty; we then feel a kind of ſtupor and indeterminate pain, like that which men of pleaſure experience when exhauſted by enjoyment When it is deſtroyed, and the ſolids pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, it forms that ſenſe of agitation we call inquietude; add to this every kind of pain accompanying the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes and infirmities attached to nature.</note>, is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0658602402:112"/>of different kinds, and each kind is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently diverſified. Thus the gay cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is ever uniform, whilſt the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humour has as many gradations, as are found between the ſlighteſt and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt melancholy.</p>
                     <p>Although the voluptuous ſenſation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the perfect ſtate of the functions of the body, be ſingle in its kind, it has however its gradations. As this equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium between the ſolids and fluids is more or leſs perfect, the agreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which reſults from it is more or leſs powerful, and the gaiety of temper more or leſs apparent.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſations therefore of pleaſure or pain have their different degrees; but theſe degrees approximate inſenſibly; there is a point where theſe ſenſations are ſo greatly weakened, that they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſtinct, but become confounded one with the other. This point depends on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0658602402:113"/>that diſpoſition of the body, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes uniformity, or rather ſerenity of temper; an indeciſive character, and ſo much the more indeciſive, as theſe ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the more confounded.</p>
                     <p>Finally, as the mechaniſm of the body, to which theſe ſenſations of pleaſure or of pain, which are the ſource of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy temper, are to be imputed, is changeable, ſo the temper varies likewiſe. Obſerve however that the agreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which depends on the perfect ſtate of the machine, can be eaſily deſtroyed; whilſt the diſagreeable ſenſation, which reſults from the primitive conſtitution of the ſolids, is in the other extreme. Thus it is not unfrequent that gaiety yields to ſadneſs, but a melancholy temper ſeldom gives way to mirth.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have diſcourſed of the temper only; let us examine that vivacity and that languor of the ſoul, which ever accompany the vigor or languor of the body, one of which wears ſo ſtrong an appearance of gaiety, and the other of ſadneſs.</p>
                     <p>We muſt conſider the languor of the ſoul, leſs as a weak degree of ſadneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0658602402:114"/>it has all the appearance of it, than as a ſtate of indetermination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Man poſſeſſes not ſufficient power to determine himſelf. Objects ever remain the ſame; they likewiſe act on our ſenſes by the ſame mechaniſm: but whilſt the body is affected with a languor, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on our organs<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book I. Art. the organs of ſenſe conſidered with regard to their different degrees of ſenſibility.</note> is much weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the deficiency of the organic elaſticity of the fibres. Thus weakened, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations communicate an impreſſion, too feeble<note n="†" place="bottom">I ſhall hereafter demonſtrate, that the ſenſations and ſentiments, when re-produced, are not more powerful.</note> to excite any ſtrong emotion in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſurpriſing relation in Man, as in every other animal, between ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſentiment and action. External ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects act upon the ſenſes, the ſenſes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify their impreſſion, convey it to the ſoul, and the ſoul conſequently re-acts on the body. Thus in the animal oeconomy, the action of external objects on the ſenſes is ever ſucceeded by the re-action of the ſoul on our organs. The one is the cauſe, the other the effect; this cauſe and this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0658602402:115"/>effect are ever proportionate. The geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body, the tone of the voice, the rapidity of the ſpeech, and every mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical motion, by which the ſoul externally diſplays its emotions, have neceſſarily a force proportionate to the vivacity of theſe emotions.</p>
                     <p>In voluntary motion the ſame relation is obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Man cannot ſee his own good without making ſome efforts to obtain it, nor be expoſed to any evil without attempting to avoid it, and that ever with an ardor proportionate to the greatneſs of the good he ſeeks, and of the evil he would avoid. Thus when the vigor of the body decays, the ſentiments are deſtitute of vivacity.</p>
                     <p>The firſt cauſe of the languor and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of the ſoul is in the organs, which receive the impreſſion of external objects; the ſecond in the ſoul, which experiences this impreſſion, and re-acts upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. In the former caſe, theſe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the body have but little effect on the ſoul; in the latter, the emotions of the ſoul have but little effect on the body.</p>
                     <p>The force of the ſenſations of the body, and of the emotions of the ſoul, is ever
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0658602402:116"/>abſolutely neceſſary to the vivacity of the temper and character; but theſe cauſes alone are not ſufficient; for the ſoul and the body are without any immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Thus, however powerful the ſenſations of the body, and the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul may be, they are inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, when not propagated reciprocally from one of theſe ſubſtances to the other. The nervous fluid being the medium of communication between theſe two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it follows, that the impulſes, tranſmitted by either, are very much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified by the action of this fluid; and their force is ever in proportion to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of this action.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the body is languid, this action is feeble; for the ſame cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the vivacity of the impreſſions of objects, continue it whilſt it is propagated; and the ſame cauſes, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to tranſmit to the ſoul the vivacity of the ſenſations of the body, are ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to tranſmit to the body the vivacity of the emotions of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Hence <hi>Macrocephali</hi> are more viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than others, and <hi>Microcephali</hi> leſs ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0658602402:117"/>Hence, likewiſe, extreme fatigue ſeems to extinguiſh in our hearts all ſentiments and deſires. Hence, after a conſiderable haemorrhage, the emotions of the ſoul are<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book I. pag. Art. of the neceſſity of arterial blood to motion.</note> without vivacity, and when our ſtrength is diſſipated, we feel only the gentle emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an indeciſive will; hence rage and courage decreaſe with the blood. When enquiring into the cauſes of vigour of body, and of the force of ſenſations, I proved, that three cauſes contribute thereto<note n="†" place="bottom">See Book I. Art. the organ of ſenſe conſidered in regard to their different degrees of ſenſibility.</note>, the primitive elaſticity of the fibres, the large diameter of their cavity, and a ſufficient quantity of the nervous fluid. Theſe concur to produce that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of our deſires and actions, which forms the ſprightly character; whilſt the lax texture of our fibres, their ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, and a deficiency of the nervous fluid form the effeminate and indolent.</p>
                     <p>Such are the cauſes of that analogy, of that harmony which is ever obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0658602402:118"/>the temper of the ſoul and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of the body, or, ſo to expreſs myſelf, between the ſtate of the body and the ſtate of the ſoul.</p>

                     <p>Although the temper be variable, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs is not equally ſubject to change in every individual. We have ſeen how the ſtate of the body forms its character; but the heart has other fources of joy and ſadneſs than theſe.</p>
                     <p>If the ſoul experiences agreeable or painful ſenſations, which ariſe from the ſtate of the body, it likewiſe experiences others which are independent of it; theſe muſt change its natural ſtate, when they are contrary to thoſe which are tranſmitted from the general organ of feeling, and with ſo much the more force, as they have greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity. The ſoul united to a ſenſible and vigorous body muſt therefore be of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the moſt inconſiſtent: but more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it be not determined by the conſtitution of the body; for at that time the ſenſations affecting it preſerve all their energy, and as if it had no character, its temper varies with the impreſſions it receives.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, vexations change not the temper of the gay; ſuch feel them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0658602402:120"/>only as ſlight pains, which ceaſing, the ſoul re-admits the ſweet impreſſions of pleaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">See Obſervations 24 and 46, Book III.</note>, and inſtantly re-aſſumes its wonted gaiety.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, pleaſure makes very ſlight impreſſions on the ſad; conſtantly concentrated within themſelves<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note>, they are ſenſible only to grief, and never admit any ſtrong impulſe of joy.</p>
                     <p>Thus, by diffuſing their colours over objects, our ſentiments acquire longer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; joy contributes to perpetuate joy in the heart, and ſadneſs to perpetuate ſadneſs.</p>

The ſoul ever engroſſed by agreeable ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pleaſing images, flattering ideas, is but ſeldom afflicted; ſadneſs has but little power over a mind ſo diſpoſed: ever ready to take all things in good part, its afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be very ſevere, if it be obliged to grieve. Thus that diſpoſition of the organs, which produces gaiety, gives at the ſame time an amiable character to the ſoul, and likewiſe generates benevolence.</p>
                     <p>The Man of a gay diſpoſition, being contented with his lot, is unenvious of others, and ſo far from deſiring to render their lives unhappy, he endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being ſo; not from pity to them, but from love to himſelf: his heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with joy, reluctantly ſupports whatever would afflict it, and haſtens to remove every painful impreſſion, which either prevents its amuſements or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts its natural gaiety.</p>

                     <p>I cannot quit a ſubject ſo extenſive: the ſimple diſpoſition of the machine which characteriſes the temper, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſes the human heart in ſo many other reſpects, that it ſeems to be inexhauſtible.</p>
                     <p>The ſad are ſuſpicious and miſtruſtful; they imagine every perſon that approaches them ready to deceive: in proportion as their grief is more acute, their ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are increaſed, and nature is covered with a darker veil.</p>
                     <p>Whence does this proceed? We are not, as is commonly done, to account for it, by ſaying, that miſtruſt is natural to a deceitful mind, and that no one can be ſuſcipious who is incapable of deceiving. This maxim is true with regard to men abſolutely ignorant, but not with regard to thoſe who have been inſtructed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: beſides, we have no proof, that the ſad are leſs juſt than the joyful; on the contrary, if we obſerve miſanthropes, ſouls gloomy by conſtitution, we ſhall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0658602402:125"/>find that plain dealing is one of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic qualities; we know with what liberty they indulge themſelves in offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive expreſſions, and how little trouble it gives them to ſpeak the moſt diſagreeable truths.</p>
                     <p>It is not in that ſo often repeated max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, but in the ſtate of the body, that we muſt look for the cauſe of this phenomenon. External objects ever take their colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the ſentiments which the ſoul at that time experiences, and it has been demonſtrated, that the proſpect of nature is in the mind only: now that particular organic diſpoſition which produces a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy temper, occaſions likewiſe loſs of vigor. Weakneſs and pain generate ſadneſs and timidity, and from theſe two diſpoſitions of the ſoul united, naturally reſult miſtruſt and ſuſpicion: for the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being more obnoxious to danger than the ſtrong, more aſſiduouſly ſeek to avoid it, are more provident and better prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſnares, obſtacles, and every kind of evil. On the other hand, the ſad collect in their minds every difficulty, exaggerate ſubjects of fear, eaſily deſpair,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0658602402:126"/>and believe every thing to be gloomy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the penſive character of the ſad, and the natural ſucceſſion of their ideas, inceſſantly exciting in the mind thoughts analogous to the ſentiment of ſadneſs then preſent, creates obſtacles, objections, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of fear and terror.</p>

The ſoul at ſuch time can re-act on the body with equal vivacity, and the repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its emotions is as ungrateful as action in the preceding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſoul, when united to a ſenſible and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous body, is therefore inactive, and leſs patiently endures inaction than exerciſe; but when united to organs compoſed of lax fibres, it is indolent and effeminate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſoul, united to groſs organs, loves lively amuſements and noiſy pleaſures; to delicate organs, refined pleaſures and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amuſements.</p>
                     <p>Brilliant colours are pleaſing to robuſt perſons; ſuch are paſſionately fond of warlike muſic, penetrating odours and ſpirituous liquors. Perſons of delicate texture and great ſenſibility, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0658602402:128"/>love light colours, ſoft muſic and ſweet odours. In the pleaſure of the mind the ſame diverſity appears; the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and the ſenſible, fly thoſe noiſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements in which the robuſt and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſo greatly delight; they love refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enjoyments, the ſweet effuſions of the mind, têtes à têtes, and every plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which ariſes from the tender union of hearts.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this phenomenon is, on one hand, the relation obſerved between the ſenſibility of our organs and the force of the impreſſion of objects; on the other, the organic diſpoſition which characteriſes the temper.</p>
                     <p>With the impreſſions we receive from objects, conſtantly concur two analogous ſentiments of the ſoul; love, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſenſations; and hatred, with painful.</p>
                     <p>All men ſeek pleaſure and fly from pain; in this they all accord: but we never ſeek objects but from the relation which they have to ourſelves, that is, from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0658602402:129"/>the degree of pleaſure they can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</p>
                     <p>The ſentiments of love and hatred muſt therefore change with theſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>A weak ſight, or rather an eye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſenſible, delights not in glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colours; ſuch being prejudicial to it. A delicate ear, delights not in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent noiſes for the ſame reaſon: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is injurious to the ſenſes, is pleaſing to no one. On the other part, every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loves to be ſenſible of its own exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus, whenever any one avoids too violent ſenſations, he ſeeks thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which have a certain degree of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity.</p>
                     <p>Hence the ſoul, which is united to groſs organs, being too weakly affected by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and delicate ſenſations, loves thoſe which are violent and ſtrong; ſuch as ſpirituous liquors, glaring colours, the ſound of the horn, trumpet, drums, and all kinds of noiſy amuſements: whilſt the ſoul, which is united to a delicate and ſenſible conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0658602402:130"/>delights only in gentle ſenſations, tender colours, expreſſive muſic, in a word, in every kind of refined and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But in theſe relations between the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul and organization, there is a more than ſimple proportion between the force of the impreſſion of objects and the delicacy of the ſenſes; for many mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pleaſures are devoid of tenderneſs, and a great number of amuſements which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be claſſed with the noiſy, excite no gentle emotion.</p>
                     <p>What then determines the ſoul, which is united to delicate organs, to tenderneſs? It is the conſtitution of the body, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in another point of view.</p>
                     <p>I have demonſtrated, that the ſtate of the body, which renders the temper gay, likewiſe renders Man a lover of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whilſt that, which renders it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, renders him penſive. But that diſpoſition, in which the functions of the organs are eaſily performed, and is the medium between vigour and imbecility,

                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0658602402:133"/>affects the ſoul with an agreeable languor, which pleaſingly allures it back within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſuch is the ſtate of the body after the moderate loſs<note n="*" place="bottom">See Obſervation 33. Book III.</note> of ſpirits; ſuch is the laſt ſtage of convaleſcence when it juſt borders on perfect health, and ſuch is the habitual diſpoſition of bodies which are delicate and ſenſible. The gentle lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor we then experience, and which is a diſpoſition to tenderneſs, conveys to the ſoul an agreeable ſenſation with which we deſire to be affected, and which we che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the heart. Hence we delight in every thing which tends to preſerve it; as, affecting muſic, amorous diſcourſes, and every pleaſure productive of tenderneſs and love.</p>
                     <p>But the affections of the ſoul are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the organization in a manner yet more particular.</p>
                     <p>The prevailing paſſion, in thoſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul which have a phyſical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is ever fixed by that ſenſe which is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0658602402:134"/>the beſt conſtituted, and by the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible organ. He whoſe organs of pleaſure poſſeſs ſenſibility ſuperior to that of his other ſenſes, is libertine and laſcivious. He whoſe palate, or rather whoſe tongue, is the moſt delicate of his organs, is a drunkard or a glutton. He whoſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is exquiſite, is paſſionately fond of muſic.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid, that the reigning paſſion is ever determined by that organ which is the moſt ſenſible: this is evident, ſince Man ſeeks pleaſure with an ardour propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to its vivacity. But if, of theſe enjoyments which he attains, one part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude another, he ever prefers that which is the moſt engaging. The more ſenſible the organs, the greater the pleaſure; for we can at all times proportion objects to the ſenſes when too delicate; but we can never proportion the organ to objects when it is deficient in ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>The gay love joy and ſeek comic or mirthful amuſements; the ſad, on the contrary, delight only in thoſe which are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0658602402:135"/>ſad and mournful; they delight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and hear related tragic adventures, ſhun gay company, fly to deſerts, woods, caves, gloomy foreſts, and ſavage na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſy to conceive why the gay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in joy, this being of itſelf agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but by what caprice do the ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſadneſs, in tragic and mournful amuſements? If we attentively conſider it, we ſhall find the cauſe of this ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phenomenon in the diſpoſition which the ſoul receives from the body, combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſelf-love. I have ſaid, that we ſeek after thoſe things only which have ſome relation to ourſelves; this is true in more than one reſpect. The ſad by conſtitution, being inceſſantly affected by a diſagreeable ſenſation, vexed that he is only conſcious of his exiſtence by his ſufferings, envious and jealous of what he does not poſſeſs, and what if he were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, he could not enjoy, hates thoſe who are leſs unhappy than himſelf; and by a natural conſequence, ſhuns all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0658602402:136"/>where there is the leaſt appearance of gaiety. The idea that himſelf is not the only miſerable being, alleviates his torments; the thought that others partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate his ſufferings gives him eaſe; thus he recounts tragic adventures, and is pleaſed at the ſight of another's misfortunes. As the only pleaſure he can enjoy is that of afflicting the happy, and as the only mean he poſſeſſes of relieving his own miſery, is the indulging himſelf in reflecting on the ſufferings of others, he flies to ſolitude, to ſavage and deſert nature, where he may, without interruption, indulge the gloomy reflections of his ſoul. Thus the phyſical ſways the moral part in Man, and the conſtitution of the body generates the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the mind.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now prove, that the force and duration of theſe affections depend whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on mechanical cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The relations, which are obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſenſibility of the body and that of the ſoul, are likewiſe obſerved between the ſtate of our organs and the character of our ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0658602402:137"/>The force, the vivacity, the duration, the violence of the ſentiments of the ſoul, are all of them effects of organization.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſations are undoubtedly not the cauſe of the paſſions; but ſenſibility is the meaſure of their force; for the deſire of being happy, which blindly leads us in queſt of pleaſure, and prompts us to fly from pain, ever carries us thither with an ardour proportioned to the greatneſs of the good we purſue, or of the evils we avoid.</p>
                     <p>As the degree of the good and of the evil is ever determined by that of ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the paſſions muſt draw their force from the organization; the ſenſibility of the ſoul being ever determined by that of the body.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſurpriſing relation in Man between ſentiment and action. He cannot perceive his good without making ſome effort to acquire it, nor be expoſed to evil, without attempting to avoid it. This I have already obſerved, but there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of repeating it here. If it be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as undoubtedly it is, that Man ever
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0658602402:138"/>yields to ſentiment, and that the degree of the good and the evil is determined in every individual by that of ſenſibility, it is plain, that the more ſenſible Man is, the greater efforts he will make to enjoy that good, or avoid that evil.</p>
                     <p>But this relation between ſentiment and action is not reſtrained to voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the action of external objects on the ſoul is ever followed by the re-action of the ſoul on the body. Unable to reſtrain the emotions agitating it within, the ſoul diſplays them externally by impreſſions purely mechanical, and ever with a force proportioned to that of its ſentiments. Thus in the violent paſſions, we are ever tranſported with ſtrong and precipitate motions; but when all is placid and quiet within, all is calm and ſerene without.</p>
                     <p>Yet the man, who is ardent in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, is not ever impetuous in his actions. Vivacity of motion ſuppoſes only great organic elaſticity of the fibres: impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requires not only great organic elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the fibres, but force and ſolidity of the organs likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0658602402:139"/>The duration of a paſſion is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its objects. The ſenſual are ever momentaneous: thoſe, which have ſome natural want for their cauſe, continue not after this want is ſupplied; the others are not more durable. But thoſe, which are produced by the imagination, are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more conſtant; they reign through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day, and diſappear not at night; they attend us when we retire to reſt, and reign in the mind when all the ſenſes are locked in ſleep. This duration of the artificial paſſions, ſo long when compared to that of the ſenſual, depends on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization combined with the nature of their different objects.</p>
                     <p>It is the property of our pleaſures mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to deſtroy each other, on enjoyment, and to have no continuance without the aſſiſtance of novelty. The objects of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures are extremely confined, compared to thoſe which are imaginary; for the firſt are determined by nature, whilſt imagination, ever active, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly modify its objects, and preſent them under new appearances. Moreover, in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0658602402:140"/>the ſenſual paſſions, the ſentiments which then engage the mind, are felt only by means of external objects; when theſe objects ceaſe to act, the ſentiment imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately becomes extinct. Thus in ſenſual love, the ſweet emotions of the ſoul, and the ſpirits, are loſt together: but in the artificial paſſions, the heated imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exaggerates objects, adorns and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhes them; the ſoul, ſeized with an enthuſiaſtic ardor, affects the body with ſtrong emotions, and thereby retains its tender ſentiments, even when pleaſure is extinct.</p>
                     <p>Nature cannot long ſupport the violence of an extremely active paſſion; the ſentiments forming this paſſion vaniſh, and inſtantly re-appear. The cauſe of this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is phyſical. In every paſſion, whilſt the ſoul is fixed on its objects, the<note n="*" place="bottom">See Obſervation 6, Book III.</note> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are tenſe; this is obſerved even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſleep, when the commerce of the ſoul with the body appears to be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the agitation of a troubleſome
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0658602402:141"/>dream, the pulſe becomes quicker, the complexion more lively, the body is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly agitated, Man awakes and finds himſelf in his bed, exhauſted by fatigue, and wet with ſweat and with his tears. In the paſſions, tenſion of the body ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies tenſion of the ſoul. This ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſentient ſubſtance is not only determined by that of the organs of the body, but wholly depends on it; for when the body is affected with languor, the ſoul receives no ſtrong ſenſation, it is inſuſceptible of it<note n="*" place="bottom">See a preceding Article. Why the character of the ſoul is ever congruous to the ſtate of the body. Book IV.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Let us then conclude, that if the ſoul cannot long ſuſtain very ſtrong emotions, it is becauſe the fibres of the body cannot endure great tenſion for any length of time.</p>
                     <p>The violent paſſions conſiſt in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſentiments, which are interrupted, one inſtant, and renewed the next; the ſucceſſion of theſe ſentiments is perceived only at intervals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0658602402:142"/>The duration of each particular ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of their total ſucceſſions, depend on the organization. For if the ſoul always requires the mediation of the body, to receive any ſtrong ſenſation; if it be unable to fix itſelf without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the other; it plainly appears, that the duration of every ſtrong emotion of the mind, and that of all theſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are ſucceſſively experienced, depends on that faculty of the body, whereby it continues tenſe a longer or ſhorter time; a faculty dependent on the different degrees of organic elaſticity and ſolidity of the fibres.</p>
                     <p>Thus the ſoul, which is united to ſtrong and elaſtic organs, is ſubject to violent and durable paſſions; that which is united to delicate organs, unable to endure long continued tenſion, paſſes inceſſantly from one impreſſion to another; and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences any which is laſting.</p>
                     <p>In the violent paſſions, the ſoul is truly paſſionate, only when engaged with its objects; when it ceaſes to be affected thereby, the paſſion expires; yet the ſame
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0658602402:143"/>internal diſpoſition continues, even when the ſoul is engaged with a new ſentiment. The cauſe of this phenomenon has been already ſhewn to be in that impreſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">See the concluſion of the 1ſt Section, Book IV.</note>, which ſenſibility produces on the body, and which in its turn, from an effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a cauſe, preſerving in the ſoul the ſentiment which produced it, and recalling it there, if at any time its object diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</p>
                     <p>But this impreſſion which the paſſions produce on our organs is not equally dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in every individual. The more ſtrong theſe emotions are, ſo much the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent is this effect; for the more ſtrong is the impulſe communicated to the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fluid by the ſoul, and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme the tenſion of the fibres, ſo much the more is their elaſticity weakened, the equilibrium between theſe two powers of the circulation deſtroyed, and the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation itſelf obſtructed. At this time the nervous fluid produces, eſpecially in the plexus nervoſi, a very great conſtriction,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0658602402:144"/>proper to continue the emotions of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>The duration of this impreſſion is at firſt, therfore, in a direct ratio of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſenſibility, afterwards in an inverſe; for the more elaſtic the fibres are, ſo much the more they yield to the action of the nervous fluid, the more forcible like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is their re-action, and the equilibrium much ſooner re-eſtabliſhed. In eſtimating theſe relations, we find the duration of this impreſſion to gain leſs by an exceſs of ſenſibility in the organs, than it is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by an exceſs of organic elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>In a body delicate and vigorous, the ſoul muſt therefore be ſubject to paſſions the moſt violent and the leaſt durable; in a body indelicate and robuſt, to thoſe which are the moſt conſtant.</p>
                     <p>Hence the reaſon why men of great ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility are eaſily provoked to anger, whilſt the indelicate and robuſt are with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty inflamed. Hence the reaſon why the anger of the former is like a fire of ſtubble, which blazes and is ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; while that of the others is of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0658602402:145"/>long continuance: once excited to fury, their ſouls cannot be appeaſed, reſentment remains after revenge is gone, like the agitated ocean, which ſubſides not to a calm till a conſiderable ſpace after the ſtorm. But the duration of the paſſions is produced by many other cauſes. Whilſt Man is intent upon the object of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he is ever ſurrounded with beings adapted to diſtract him, he eaſily loſes ſight of it: this very frequently happens. During theſe moments of diſtraction, if the ſenſation which occaſioned it be not very intereſting, the paſſion muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a latent fire, which inſtantly blazes forth on the leaſt admiſſion of air.</p>
                     <p>If the ſoul be ſtrongly affected by theſe new objects, the paſſion revives not, but yields to ſome other ſentiment. Thus the more ſenſible a man is, the more he is expoſed to the impreſſion of external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the more eaſily will his paſſions be extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>This is the cauſe why the virtue of the ſprightly is neither regular nor conſtant;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0658602402:146"/>it appears only at intervals, by ſtarts, as if it had no ſource in the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they being obliged to be frequently recalled to the practice of it: while the virtue of the ſedate and robuſt has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of conſtant habit.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, while the paſſion is extremely violent, and any ſentiment ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizes in the ſoul, other objects have not power to diſengage the attention.</p>
                     <p>The paſſions therefore, if they are, on one ſide, leſs conſtant in proportion as Man is more ſenſible; they are, on the other, more conſtant in proportion as he poſſeſſes greater ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>This is obſerved more eſpecially in the paſſions which have a ſentiment of love for their baſis: when the ſoul believes that its own happineſs depends on the poſſeſſion of ſome object, nothing can diſengage it from thence; the powerful attractives of pleaſure keep it intent on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object, and admits of no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                     <p>From theſe obſervations let us conclude, that,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0658602402:147"/>A Man of extreme ſenſibility, who has only ſlight affections, muſt be the moſt fickle of human kind; he is never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as when violently excited by ſome paſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The force of the paſſions therefore depends on the ſenſibility of the fibres; their violence on their extreme ſenſibility, and their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſity on their ſenſibility combined with their force: the duration of the paſſions depends equally on the ſenſibility and elaſticity of the fibres, and on their force and ſolidity.</hi> It is thus the phyſical part in Man gives cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to our ſentiments and paſſions.</p>

                     <head>How Organization renders <hi>MAN</hi> open-hearted, or a Diſſembler.</head>
                     <p>To the preceding truths, I add another which ariſes immediately from them.</p>
                     <p>The ſame organic elaſticity, which cauſes the extreme force of the paſſions, renders Man frank and open-hearted; for the ſoul cannot conceal its emotions, they ruſh out precipitately, and appear in his geſture, ſpeech and voice; finally, the repreſſing of theſe emotions is ever painful,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0658602402:148"/>and even impoſſible, when the ſoul is ſtrongly affected. Reſerve is peculiar to ſouls united to organs of lax or very groſs fibres; frankneſs, to ſouls united to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of extreme organic elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>Men of great ſenſibility and livelineſs, always ſpeak the language which ſprings from the heart, the language of truth; thus it is by warming the heart of him who is naturally cold, that is, by aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his ſenſibility, by increaſing the elaſticity of his fibres, that wine baniſhes reſerve and lays open the heart.</p>
                     <p>Thus no credit is to be given to perſons of known diſſimulation and habitual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, unleſs in the paroxyſms of paſſion. Then only are their words without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; in theſe moments, the violence of the emotions of the ſoul augments the tenſion of the fibres, affects them with a ſlight rigidity, frees them from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the will<note n="*" place="bottom">See obſervations 62, Book III.</note>, makes them drop the maſk and appear without diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>When you preſs the chaſte miſtreſs of your heart to lay open her mind to you,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0658602402:149"/>although ſhe ſubmits with regret to the leſſons of her mother, and to the ſevere laws of modeſty, ſhe nevertheleſs divulges not her true ſentiments; ſhe allows ſhe has a friendſhip for you, and nothing more. But when wearied out with a long and painful reſiſtance, the diſſembling fair permits her lover to triumph; while love fires her veins; while ſhe embraces her beloved with tranſports; claſps him in her arms; preſſes him to her eager boſom, and her humid lips attract and diſtil pleaſure; her voice is broken and faultering, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can ſhe articulate a few words—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of tenderneſs and love.</p>

                     <p>Let us again examine the effects of the primitive and organic elaſticity of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres; for what a diverſity in the moral character is produced by the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of theſe corporeal faculties! What ſurpriſing phenomena, of which they are the cauſe! Principles the moſt fertile!
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0658602402:150"/>Principles! whoſe extent, when fully known, demonſtrate them to be almoſt inexhauſtible.</p>
                     <p>We do not compaſſionate the miſerable, but from an idea of his ſufferings; we have no idea of pain till we have experienced it ourſelves: if, therefore, to bemoan others, we muſt have ſuffered ourſelves, ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a diſpoſition abſolutely neceſſary to pity.</p>
                     <p>If united to groſs organs, or to fibres too ſolid or too lax, the ſoul becomes obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and inflexible; when united to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans delicate, elaſtic and vigorous, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes compaſſionate and tender. Hence pity, although an artificial ſentiment, is nevertheleſs, in every individual, modified by the organization.</p>
                     <p>The greater the ſenſibility of Man, he may thence be the more humane; and by a very ſingular conſequence, he may thence be the more cruel. For if, to bemaon others, we muſt be ſenſible ourſelves, it is equally true, that we diſcover only that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility for others which we want not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The more ſenſible any one is, the more aſſiduous is he to avoid pain, the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0658602402:151"/>more eager after pleaſure, the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by himſelf, and the leſs concerned for others. If, in theſe caſes, ſenſibility be fixed on the ſenſual or artificial paſſions, which have neither generoſity, clemency, nor goodneſs, for their object; the voice of pleaſure drowns that of pity; the heart is contracted and ſhrunk within itſelf, the ſoul, full of the object of its deſires, denies its attention to every thing beſides, and is no long either clement or humane. If the well-being of others be inconſiſtent with our own, theſe affections become more extreme; for if it be a conſequence of the love of ourſelves, to love thoſe things which are beneficial, ſo likewiſe it muſt be, to hate thoſe which are prejudicial to us. Thus they, whom we now look upon with indifference, become the object of our moſt extreme hatred, when we regard them as enemies; in the heat of paſſion we treat them with the greateſt virulence, relentleſsly ſeek their ruin, aggravate their miſery, and view their ſufferings with an eye of ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>The more ſenſible likewiſe Man is, the more fearful he is of pain, and the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0658602402:152"/>more timid; the fear of his enemy prompts him to complete his deſtruction, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opportunity offers. Let us therefore conclude, that the more ſenſible a Man is, the more he is obnoxious to hatred, his cruelty is greater, and the more atrocious his character.</p>
                     <p>Another reaſon, which modifies pity in our hearts, is drawn from that diſpoſition of the body which characteriſes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the mind.</p>
                     <p>I have ſhewn that the melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, by centering Man's thoughts in himſelf, renders him unſociable, obdurate and cruel.</p>
                     <p>That, which conſtitutes good humour, is much more favourable to pity; yet in ſome particular inſtances leſs ſo. In the gay, the ſentiment of pleaſure, ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in the ſoul, nouriſhes therein ideas of joy, and the ſight of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py generates thoſe of ſadneſs. Theſe therefore are weakened by the former, and conſequently make not their full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                     <p>The diſpoſition of the body, which conſtitutes ſerenity of temper, is much
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0658602402:153"/>more favourable; as it leaves Man the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire liberty of his mental faculties, and changes not the impreſſion of objects.</p>
                     <p>But of all diſpoſitions of the body, that is the moſt favourable which conſtitutes the tender character, that diſpoſition of the ſoul which determines it to compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Man who is conſtitutionally ſad may be juſt and ſincere; the gay may be equitable and meek; and a Man of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene temper may poſſeſs the virtues of both. But it is only to the Man of a delicate conſtitution of body, that Nature has given a compaſſionate heart; on him only has ſhe beſtowed that noble propenſity to clemency, that generoſity of ſoul, which takes pleaſure in mingling tears with the afflicted, in melting at another's woe, and relieving the oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Let us add, that it is the ſame diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body which generates in our hearts, that goodneſs which prevents the requeſts of others, and that eaſy communicability of heart, which, in a moment, contracts the moſt durable friendſhips, produces that ſenſibility and tendency of mind,

                  <p>WHAT an aſtoniſhing variety of minds! How different their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters!</p>
                  <p>All men compare and combine their ſenſations to a certain degree; but every one is not equally capable of comparing and generalizing them, and of forming therefrom ideas and new combinations. All have not the gift of invention, nay, not even that of perfecting what is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy invented. How few are able to think of themſelves! How many others, yet more confined, who cannot think at all, but are ever chained down to imitation,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0658602402:158"/>never doing any thing but what they have ſeen done before, nor ſaying any thing but what they have heard ſaid, as if endowed with inſtinct only, and entirely deſtitute of judgment!</p>
                  <p>In diſtinguiſhing the operations of the mind relatively to their objects, we find, that the greateſt part of mankind are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined to the combination of ſenſations, and that but very few can attain to that of ideas; but amongſt the ſmall number of thoſe who think, what diverſity appears!</p>
                  <p>There are ſome whoſe activity of ſoul is ſuch, that they can never ſeize any principle, without tracing it to its moſt diſtant conſequences. There are others, and of theſe the number is very great, whoſe leſs active ſouls let every conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence eſcape them, which has not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of evidence at firſt ſight, and ſeize thoſe only which preſent themſelves.</p>
                  <p>How different likewiſe their character! In one, judgment is the chief power of the mind; in another, imagination; this is fertile in ideas; that other has ſolidity of judgment; this is more impetuous, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in argument; that reaſons more
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0658602402:159"/>cloſely, and is more conciſe; this excites admiration by his lively fallies, that by the force and ſolidity of his eloquence ſilences, guides and governs us.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this diverſity of minds has been ineffectually ſought; but if any one ſufficiently attends, he will diſcover this, as well as the character of the heart, to proceed from the diſpoſition of the corporeal organs.</p>
                  <p>The impetuous <hi>Eſchylus,</hi> the agreeable <hi>Horace,</hi> the ſublime <hi>Milton,</hi> the judicious <hi>Bacon,</hi> the profound <hi>Newton,</hi> the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi> in a word, every man owes the turn and character of his mind to the conſtitution of his body.</p>
                  <p>But not to reſt content with merely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting this truth, I proceed to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it, to determine the diſpoſitions of our organs, which occaſion the diverſity of mind, and develope the unknown laws of their myſterious influence. In order to account for thoſe phenomena, I ſhall not follow the tract of thoſe who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it before me, nor will I have recourſe to forced explanations, which are neither convincing nor ſatisfactory: while
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0658602402:160"/>the natural proofs ariſe ſpontaneouſly and lead us, as it were, by the hand, to the ſcope of our purſuit. Here ſhall be no enquiry concerning the complicated and wonderful ſtructure of the brain, nor the obſcure and chimerical modifications of fibres and fibrillae, which are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly magnified by ſome authors. Theſe phenomena are produced by the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable laws; by cauſes ſo ſimple, and ſo evident, that it is really aſtoniſhing no one ſhould have diſcovered them till now.</p>

                     <p>There are ſome men, whoſe active ſouls receive few ſenſations without comparing them; theſe are the moſt ingenious.</p>
                     <p>There are others who compare only a certain kind of ſenſations; theſe are leſs ingenious than the former, and ſo much the leſs ſo, as their ſouls have a leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to compare their ſenſations, and to form ideas therefrom.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0658602402:161"/>nor combine any thing at firſt ſight; they require ſenſations which are both ſtrong, and many times repeated, before they are brought to compare them, and to form any idea: ſuch, being more or leſs ſtupid, differ not from the weak minds, but in the ſmall number of their ideas, which they ſo laboriouſly produce.</p>
                     <p>No man deſires to know, but becauſe he deſires to be happy: he who is without deſires, and without fears, will certainly not give himſelf the trouble of comparing his ſenſations, of combining his ideas, and reaſoning therefrom.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0658602402:163"/>a creative imagination, or a great genius: they can indeed render Man eager after ſucceſs; but they ſupply not the qualities, which are neceſſary to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of it. Some phyſical diſpoſitions therefore are required, together with the ſenſibility of our organs.</p>
                     <p>Let us inquire into the nature of theſe diſpoſitions.</p>
                     <p>At our birth none of the mental facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is unfolded, none in exerciſe<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. Of the unfolding of our men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculties.</note>, not even inſtinct. But whether the ſoul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted before its union with the body, or whether it had any peculiar method of acquiring knowledge or not, it is moſt certain, that when once it has become ſubject to the laws of this union, it no longer retains aught of its former ſtate, not even the remembrance of it.</p>
                     <p>Every man poſſeſſes the power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but even although we ſuppoſe that every man poſſeſſed it alike, the minds of individuals would not be leſs different; for the underſtanding can never proceed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0658602402:164"/>alone; but requires the concurrence of the ſenſitive faculty, or rather that of the ſenſations.</p>
                     <p>Examine the productions of the human mind, the moſt ſingular works of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even thoſe which have the leaſt analogy to nature; all have for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſenſible objects, or relations of theſe objects. Almoſt all our thoughts are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal images, and of the moſt abſtract ideas there is none which is not fixed by the ſenſes; there is not throughout all nature a work of the pure intellect. If we deſired, for inſtance, to form any idea of the Deity, or his attributes, we ſhould conſider him under human relations; at one time, as a beneficent father: at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a glorious King; now, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent maſter; then, as an offended Judge.</p>
                     <p>He who would riſe to the firſt of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and contemplate him in his eſſence without the aid of corporeal images, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no relation between God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, knows not how to form any notion of him, and is loſt in the ſublimity of the idea. Thus all religions are ſupported by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0658602402:165"/>a groſs worſhip, which interpoſes mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial objects between the ſupreme Being and Man. One contemplates the Deity in his works, another worſhips him under an imaginary reſemblance; for the heart, as well as the mind, is ever fixed by the intervention of the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>Thus likewiſe, when we form to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a notion of the ſoul, we ever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it as a thin ſhade, or ſubtil matter; in ſhort, as a corporeal being, if we form any image of it at all.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever object we chuſe, the caſe is the ſame; for let us employ our utmoſt efforts to form ideas wholly intellectual, or to conceive pure ſpirituality, the only conſequence of the attempt is to involve the mind in greater darkneſs and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Every idea therefore is formed from the true or falſe relations of ſenſible objects; whence the underſtanding never operates without the concurrence of the ſenſations: in proportion as they are removed from their objects, the ideas we would convey become unintelligible; without their aſſiſtance our ideas either eſcape us, or they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver formed at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0658602402:166"/>Let us conclude from the preceding, that the ſenſations are the baſis of all our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>What a variety of minds therefore muſt be produced by the different ſtructure of the organs of the ſenſes, the only means whereby we can have communication with the various beings which ſurround us.</p>
                     <p>Our knowledge is neither increaſed nor perfected but by the comparing our ſenſations. The greater the number of ſenſations to be compared, ſo much the more numerous are our ideas; the more diſtinct theſe ſenſations, ſo much the more clear are our conceptions, and the more exact theſe compariſons, the more perfect our knowledge muſt be. On the contrary, the ſmaller the number of our ſenſations, the more confined is the ſphere of mental activity, and the leſs numerous our ideas; not only from the privation of thoſe ideas which are founded on the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſenſe we are without: but from the privation of many others; for it is evident that, as all the parts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are connected, the ſenſations of one ſenſe often ſerve to diſcover the relations of the ſenſations of another ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0658602402:167"/>The number of our ideas muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be relative to the number and ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe organs: whence <hi>Man muſt be leſs intelligent, leſs ingenious, in proportion as he poſſeſſes a ſmaller number of ſenſes, and as his ſenſes are leſs exquiſite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although there is an intimate relation between the number of ſenſations and that of ideas, this relation is not equal with regard to every ſenſe; one ſenſe may be confined whilſt another is leſs ſo.</p>
                     <p>From a calculation of the number of the objects of the ſenſes, the organ of ſmelling appears to be the moſt confined, and that of ſeeing the leaſt ſo. The eye is of all the bodily organs the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, and takes in the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of objects; forms, dimenſions, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, are all within its diſtrict; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties it perceives in each of theſe modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of matter infinitely ſurpaſs all thoſe within the cognizance of the taſte, ſmelling, hearing, and feeling; that is, of ſounds<note n="*" place="bottom">I conſider not the car as the organ of ſounds, the conventional ſigns of our thoughts, and I look upon the eye in the ſame light. For if Man, deaf from his birth, receives no advantage from converſation, ſo the Man that is blind receives none from reading: and if it be poſſible to ſupply the defect of hearing, by the ſight, ſo it is likewiſe that of ſeeing, by the ear: every thing is therefore in this reſpect equal, the difference between the number of their ſenſations continuing the ſame.</note>, ſavours, odours, and ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0658602402:168"/>from the touch. This is evident during ſleep; for the many ſenſations which are retraced in the mind during reſt, are ſo many images of viſible objects. The ſight therefore contributes more to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than any of our other ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the nature of our ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is very evident, that, from the different ſtructure of the ſenſes in different individuals, there muſt be a great diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their reſpective impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Every object muſt naturally produce on Man, an agreeable or painful impreſſion; for every Man is a ſenſible being, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible being muſt be ſuſceptible of either pleaſure or pain; but it does not therefore follow, that the ſame object ſhould produce, in every individual, the ſame ſenſation; their reſpective ſenſes not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0658602402:169"/>being of ſimilar organization. In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner material objects affect the ſenſes, it is certain, that the ſame objects affect them not equally in every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and conſequently produce not in the ſoul the ſame impreſſions. The lilly is not beautiful to every eye, neither is the anana pleaſant to every palate, nor the ſong of the nightingale to every ear. I ſhall not ſpeak here of theſe diverſities in the ſenſations of individuals, as their cauſe is utterly unknown; but ſhall attend to thoſe which are more evident and better underſtood.</p>
                     <p>The chief differences between the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of different individuals conſiſt in their delicacy, in the greatneſs of their image, and in the number of the objects compoſing the picture; the two laſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of theſe differences are peculiar to the organ of ſight, the other is common to all the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>The more delicate an organ is, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it perceives thoſe minute objects which eſcape organs which are leſs ſo. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of the ſenſes is often neceſſary to the acquiſition of many ſorts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0658602402:170"/>we are indebted for the diſcovery of the Satellites of Jupiter, and other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bodies, of the animalcula in liquors, and of the minutiae of anatomy, to thoſe inſtruments which have been contrived to ſupply the imperfection of our ſenſes. Theſe ſupplements have advanced our knowledge in many reſpects beyond the point to which it had arrived a few ages ago, and have, in our times, conduced to the diſcovery of many great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truths. But as a delicate organ is more ſuſceptible of irritation, and leſs diſtinctly receives ſtrong ſenſations than another that is leſs ſo, it loſes on one ſide what it gains on another, and ſometimes more. To what uſe would the faculty of ſeeing in the dark ſerve, if the light of day be painful to the ſight; it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that a perſon ſo circumſtanced would loſe by the exchange. With an eye, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which comprehends only a ſmall proſpect, we can diſcover particular beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more diſtinctly, than with an eye which takes in an extenſive circuit; but we ſee not ſo well the harmony of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0658602402:171"/>whole<note n="*" place="bottom">It is becauſe attention is weakened by being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to many objects.</note>. A too comprehenſive organ ſees detached parts imperfectly: an organ not ſufficiently ſo diſcerns not their relations.</p>
                     <p>By entering into an examination of the ſenſations which are employed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſciences, we might determine what particular ſtructure of the ſenſes is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted for each; but, in general, organs moderately delicate, adapted to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a moderate number of objects, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of every faculty (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion) in a mean propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional degree, are the moſt advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſtructed. In caſes where pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration depends on the number and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctneſs of the ſenſations, and on the comparing the ſenſations together, he whoſe ſenſes are beſt conſtructed, muſt therefore have the greateſt natural quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But we perceive not, ſays a celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted philoſopher<note n="†" place="bottom">Buffon's Natural Hiſtory, Vol. 4. 12mo edit.</note>, that perſons whoſe ſenſes are dull, ſight imperfect, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </p>
                     <p>The obſervation is juſt, if underſtood of civilized nations; for how is it poſſible to perceive the advantage of a ſuperior orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of the ſenſes in ſociety, where Man can eaſily find means to ſupply the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his ſenſes? What defect is there of the organs, for which art affords not ſome remedy? The ſhort-ſighted are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with teleſcopes which bring near the moſt diſtant objects; the weak-ſighted are ſupplied with microſcopes, angiſcopes, and other glaſſes, which make them diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh minute objects which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſcape them. To perſons of dull hearing, are given acouſtic inſtruments; for thoſe in whom the ſenſe of ſmelling is decayed, or taſte imperfect, are prepared concentrated odours, ſavours, juices and quinteſſences. Supplied with theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, is it ſtrange that men, whoſe ſenſes are imperfect, ſhould become, in this reſpect, equal to thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from nature the moſt perfect organs? Take your obſervations from perſons deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

                     <p>I ſhall prove hereafter (in oppoſition to the vulgar opinion) that our ſenſes are not rendered more perfect by uſe: but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be true, what would our phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher infer from his vague aſſertion againſt the advantage of well organized ſenſes? Without doubt Man may have exerciſed his eyes and ears, yet not be more ingenious than another who has not; he may even poſſibly be leſs ſo: for the mere exerciſe of our ſenſes can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our knowledge; they muſt have been alſo exerciſed on ſubjects which are not only important, but relative to ſome ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Were a man to ſpend his whole life in examining grains of ſand, he would not be leſs ignorant, although he might know their different configuration, than when he firſt began; but if, inſtead of this unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and barren occupation, he had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame length of time in examining
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0658602402:174"/>plants, animalcula, and in forming ſuch obſervations upon natural hiſtory, as have rendered <hi>Malpighi, Lewenhoeck</hi> and <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenbroek</hi> ſo famous; do you ſuppoſe he would have profited nothing by this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe?

                     <p>It is unknown whether the ſoul, when diſunited from the body, can perceive, think, or remember its ſenſations and ideas or not; but it is certain, that, when once it is united to the body, the unfolding of its faculties depends entirely on the ſtate of the body with which it is yoked. Let us endeavour to diſcover the latent reaſons of this important truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0658602402:177"/>Without ſenſations there can be no ideas, as has been already demonſtrated; but if all our ideas are founded on the ſenſations, they likewiſe depend on the underſtanding by which they are formed. The mind cannot form them in the ſame manner in every individual, nor can it form them always in the ſame manner in the ſame perſon.</p>
                     <p>When the impreſſions of objects are made on the organ, and the ſenſations are received by the ſoul, all the functions of the ſenſes are diſcharged, but not all the functions of the body.</p>
                     <p>To judge of the relations of objects, we muſt diſtinguiſh theſe objects with care, examine and compare them under their different appearances: this requires attention.</p>
                     <p>Attention is the parent of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: attention, by applying the mind to the conſideration of beings, diſcovers to us their different properties: attention, by fixing it upon the different phenomena of Nature, inveſtigates its unknown laws and its ſecret relations, which otherwiſe eſcape us: attention produces, from the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0658602402:178"/>various combinations of our obſervations, thoſe ſublime diſcoveries, thoſe admirable inventions, thoſe prodigies of ſcience, thoſe productions of genius, which have been in ſo many various ways beneficial to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Without attention every pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon in nature is loſt to us; in vain is the ſoul endued with ſuch noble faculties, in vain does the univerſe offer its vaſt and wonderful volume to our ſight.</p>
                     <p>Attention is ſtrengthened by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrated; it then ſuſpends all the other faculties of the mind, and ſeems to have intire poſſeſſion of the ſoul. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is weakened by being divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: when it has got half way in a geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical demonſtration, if any ſingular object affect our organs, the mind is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſtracted, ſuffers itſelf to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by this object, and after it has wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a while, endeavours in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the thread of its former thoughts. Thus every ſenſation foreign to the object preſent in the mind, diverts and deſtroys the attention.</p>
                     <p>To examine objects, to reflect, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, the mind muſt be perfectly calm;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0658602402:179"/>no ſenſation, no foreign ſentiment, muſt then affect the ſoul. <hi>The firſt thing therefore neceſſary to the free exerciſe of thought, and to the unfolding of the intellectual faculties, is that the ſoul be united to a body, whoſe vital functions</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Book IV. Art. How organization renders Man fickle, thoughtful, volatile or taciturn.</note>
                        <hi>are performed with eaſe, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and regularity;</hi> that is, that the powers which cauſe circulation have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of organic elaſticity, proportionate to the volume and conſiſtence of the fluids.</p>
                     <p>But it is not enough that the ſoul be united to a body in perfect health, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from diſeaſe; for, that the body may not diſtract the ſoul from the objects on which it is intent, the ſenſation which reſults from the action of our organs muſt be imperceptible. Thus <hi>the diſpoſition moſt favourable to the reflection, is that ſtate of the machine which conſtitutes ſerenity of temper:</hi> that, which cauſes gaiety, allures the mind towards outward objects<note n="†" place="bottom">See Book IV. the ſame Art.</note>; that, which cauſes ſadneſs, attracts it within: the one prevents it from examining ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0658602402:180"/>the other from combining their impreſſions; both diſtract it, and interrupt the ſeries of its thoughts. Beſides, with that diſpoſition which conſtitutes ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we can contemplate Nature with the greateſt advantage, and diſcern what ſhe really is.</p>
                     <p>It is only in retirement, and when the paſſions are at reſt, that the ſoul can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign itſelf to profound meditation: it is only in thoſe tranquil moments, when the ſoul retires within itſelf and is wrapt in ſilence, that we can meditate to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>They who have great ſenſibility, enjoy leaſt of this liberty of mind; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expoſed to be acted on by objects, and being ſtrongly affected by their ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impreſſions, they are almoſt always engaged by externals. This extreme ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, I allow, may be in ſome meaſure remedied by ſhunning every kind of noiſe, avoiding the light of day, and retiring to ſilence and ſolitude of the country, or by taking advantage of the ſtillneſs of the night. But theſe precautions are practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in certain caſes only; yet, though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0658602402:181"/>precaution ſhould be uſed, the ſenſible will ſtill be more obnoxious to diſtraction: for the delicate and ſenſible are ſubject to more wants, more indiſpoſitions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to more frequent diſtractions, than thoſe who are robuſt and of ſtrong conſtitutions. Thus almoſt inceſſantly influenced by their various wants, and as conſtantly engaged in the gratification of them, as if unavoidably attached to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objects, they eaſily loſe the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the paſt, together with the power of conſidering and meditating on thoſe objects which preſent themſelves to the mind, or rather they never poſſeſs it. For during the perpetual flux of tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſenſations which inceſſantly attract the attention outwardly, they can neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine nor meditate upon any ſubject what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore extremely difficult, if not impoſſible, for a ſoul united to very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate organs, to employ itſelf in profound meditation, and to enjoy that liberty which is ſo neceſſary to the ſtudy of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Reflection is a ſtate of the mind which requires a ſufficient degree of ſenſibility to be ſtrongly affected, but not enough to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0658602402:182"/>make it be irreſiſtibly attracted by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objects. <hi>Only the Man whoſe ſoul is united to organs of moderate ſenſibility, can meditate at liberty and ſtudy with ſucceſs.</hi>

                     <head>Organization renders the Underſtanding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt, extenſive, delicate, profound; or ſuperficial, confined, erroneous and groſs.</head>
                     <p>Our intellectual faculties are neither developed nor improved, but in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the mind compares its ſenſations. The more it compares them, the more it diſcovers their relations, and the more numerous are our ideas; the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully it examines them, ſo much the more perfect is our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>I have diſtinguiſhed two powers of the underſtanding, that of perceiving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering objects, and that of pronouncing on their relations. The firſt is the baſis of the ſecond, and neceſſarily precedes it. What then is requiſite to enable the mind to form a ſound judgment of things? An accurate perception of them. It is therefore on the greater or leſs degree of attention we employ in examining
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0658602402:183"/>objects, or rather on the different apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the mind for attention, combined with the time it is able to ſupport it, that the juſtneſs of our judgments and the character of our ideas depend.</p>
                     <p>To acquire profound ideas, we muſt for a long time, and without diſtraction, contemplate the ſame objects, conſider their relations, their difference, examine, compare and combine them in many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhapes, that we may afterwards conſider them under unobſerved appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and diſcover their hidden relations.</p>
                     <p>I will not however ſay, that every great diſcovery has been made by gradual ſeries of combinations and complicated obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Sometimes the mind overlooks the intermediate ſpace, and perceives its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at a diſtance amidſt ſurrounding darkneſs: but if in this manner it arrive at truth, it muſt nevertheleſs return to obſervation, to experience, and to this gradual ſeries of combinations, to verify theſe new ideas, and connect them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which have been already acquired. Thus having at once traverſed an immenſe ſpace, it is afterwards obliged to paſs over
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0658602402:184"/>every intermediate degree which ſeparates the two extremes, returning circularly to the point from whence it at firſt ſet out. Such is the progreſs of the human mind in diſcoveries of every ſort.</p>
                     <p>Thus a perſon deſirous to acquire new knowledge, or verify that which he has already acquired, can never accompliſh his deſign, but by a long and cloſe exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the phenomena of nature.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore only to attention more or leſs ſtrong, more or leſs continued<note n="*" place="bottom">This attention is not the ſame with that which is required in ſtudying the languages; in this latter, every thing is unconnected; in the former, every thing is connected: in the one, the mind relieves itſelf by employing attention but at intervals, when prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the will, and by paſſing from one object to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but in the other, the ſame ſubject requires conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued attention, the ſoul cannot examine and repoſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alternately. He who deſires to divide his time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the examination of objects and repoſe, is ever at a ſtand in his obſervations, is conſtantly diſtracted in his thoughts, is perpetually obliged to recommence the ſame labour, and never profits by his pains.</note>, that we owe the ſuperficiality or profundity of ideas.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0658602402:185"/>This different aptitude of the mind for attention, and the ſpace of time it is able to ſupport it, abſolutely depend on organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for the mind becomes fatigued juſt as the body does, and both at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>It is unknown whether the ſoul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fatigued; for our knowledge of things is not ſufficient to demonſtrate whether an immaterial ſubſtance is, or is not, naturally ſuſceptible of laſſitude; but without the leaſt doubt, the ſoul, when once it is unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the body, and during the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of its union therewith, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences a ſenſe of fatigue as frequently as the body.</p>
                     <p>Might I have leave to offer my opinion upon ſo delicate a ſubject as this is, I would declare for the negative, and would ſupport it thus.</p>
                     <p>Since the ſenſe of laſſitude is common to both ſoul and body when united, it is evident, that the ſoul muſt become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued together with the body.</p>
                     <p>The laſſitude of the mind is partly the laſſitude of the body itſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Laſſitude of body is only an unpleaſing ſenſation, which ariſes from the too frequent and too continued tenſion of the fibres, by which the nervous fluid which diſtends them is exhauſted, their organic elaſticity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, a languor ſeizes the ſenſes, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is affected with ſtupor.</note>, which is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0658602402:186"/>communicated to it by the general organ of feeling, and probably it is no more than this; for ſince the mind, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, requires the fibres to be tenſe, and as the fibres are ever fatigued by their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is not to be wondered at that the ſoul ſhould ceaſe to be intent, when the fibres ceaſe to be tenſe, or, which is the ſame, the mind ever appears fatigued when the body is tired, and the body is tired at all times when the mind is fatigued. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have no idea of the laſſitude of the ſoul, but by the weakneſs of its thoughts and emotions, and by their ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the ſame ſubject. When the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is tired, that is, when the organs are affected with languor, the functions of the ſoul muſt needs be languid, the ideas ſcarcely diſtinct, and the vivacity of the ſentiments decayed<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book IV. Art. the character of the ſoul ever congruous to the ſtate of the body.</note>. This has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready explained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0658602402:187"/>It is therefore evident to me, that the laſſitude of the ſoul is only laſſitude of the body<note n="*" place="bottom">If our fatigue be ſomewhat diminiſhed by a change of objects, it is not becauſe the ſoul then acts upon others fibres, as a modern writer has ſuppoſed, but that the ſoul, rouſed by this new object, experiences a freſh pleaſure, which partly conceals the prior ſenſe of fatigue, and likewiſe, becauſe this new object of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten requires a leſs degree of attention, which dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution adminiſters ſome ſort of relaxation and repoſe. But if this new object require greater attention, ſo far from relieving the fatigue of the ſoul, it very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly augments it. This we experience when we change the ſtudy of hiſtory, for that of geometry, or the ſuperficial peruſal of a romance, for ſome deep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem in mathematics.</note>, and that in this phenomenon, as in many others, the reality is concealed by the appearance.</p>
                     <p>But whether it be ſo or not, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the mind is fatigued together with the body. This is an obſervation which univerſally prevails, yet no one has hitherto thought proper to deduce the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequences from it.</p>
                     <p>When the body is fatigued, admitting that the ſoul really fatigues the body by application, let us be ever ſo deſirous to continue our meditation, and make what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0658602402:188"/>efforts we pleaſe, we cannot long keep the mind fixed on the ſame object, nor fix it there for any time ſtrongly. <hi>The ſoul therefore cannot continue its attention, when the fibres have loſt their tenſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is therefore erroneous to ſuppoſe, as many philoſophers have done, that our aptitude for attention ſolely depends on the power of the paſſions. It is true, that the greater intereſt we take in applying ourſelves to any particular ſtudy, the longer we can ſupport attention; paſſion can then employ the whole ſtrength of the body, but nothing more: hence let the paſſion be ever ſo violent, <hi>attention is always proportionate to the elaſticity and force of the fibres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, forced attention is more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial than favourable to our ſtudy. In the firſt place, it cannot be very ſtrong, from the painful ſenſation which ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies it: its duration likewiſe is very ſhort; for when the organs are once wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they act but with little force; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the body is exhauſted by thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent efforts, and Man loſes by its diſordered ſtate all the time which he endeavours to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0658602402:189"/>gain by this prolongation of attention, and ſometimes even more.</p>
                     <p>Such are the phyſical cauſes of many diverſities of mind; cauſes which have hitherto been unnoticed by philoſophers, although they ſo naturally ariſe on exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the phenomena I have now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to explain. And here let us repeat our firſt principle, in order to a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its effects, and that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its proper conſequences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Attention is ever proportionate to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic elaſticity and force of the fibres.</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce profoundideas, the mind therefore muſt be united to organs compoſed of fibres which are both ſtrong and elaſtic; the mind, if united to in-elaſtic and weak organs, is trifling and ſupercifial in its operations. Thus a Man, whoſe conſtitution is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and ſenſible, is not capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found diſquiſitions: too weak to ſuſtain long meditation, and too ſenſible to lead a contemplative life, he beholds Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without attending to particular parts, inceſſantly flies from object to object, glances upon them, and dips not beneath the ſurface.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0658602402:190"/>However, I do not pretend to ſay, that every man of ſtrong and vigorous conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is thus profound; for, beſides this phyſical diſpoſition, his talents muſt be cultivated; all I would be underſtood to ſay is, that only a man of ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of bodily organs can arrive at this ſtate; others may, indeed, have a great number of juſt and ſolid ideas, but never thoſe which are profound and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected. That ſublime knowledge, which is derived from the conſtant ſtudy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is what they are unable to acquire of themſelves; on the contrary, they muſt be initiated in it by others: their minds may be congenial with the minds of Pope and Voltaire, but will never riſe to the dignity of Newton's or de Monteſquieu's; they may be called men of wit and learning, but never men of depth.</p>
                     <p>To be juſt, our ideas muſt be diſtinct; but theſe qualities are not always united. To conceive diſtinctly, it is ſufficient that our ſenſations be well expreſſed, and that the mind be exact in pronouncing on their apparent relations; but to conceive juſtly, there is required a perfect knowledge of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0658602402:191"/>every relation neceſſary to form a ſolid judgment. Thus ideas may be diſtinct, yet not be juſt.</p>
                     <p>We may therefore from this cauſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſtly upon one article and falſely upon another; but in every caſe, where to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the true relations of beings, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that we attentively examine them; in every caſe where the knowledge of things is the reſult of a great number of complicated combinations; in every caſe where truth is difficultly obtained, and where there is a neceſſity of ſeeing much, if we deſire to ſee well, the juſtneſs of our judgments depends on the capacity of the mind, and on its profoundneſs, or rather, juſtneſs and profoundneſs require the ſame degree of attention of the ſoul, and the ſame organic diſpoſition of the body. With feeble and delicate organs, therefore, Man is incapable of this juſtneſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: too weak to conſider objects under their various appearances ſucceſſively, and too feeble to purſue the connexion of things, and to collect a multiplicity of ideas in the ſame point; he ſuffers many things to eſcape, from an inability to retain them,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0658602402:192"/>and examines haſtily thoſe which remain: thus paſſing ſlightly over many objects, and judging of the whole by his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of a part, he forms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions neceſſarily falſe and inconcluſive.</p>
                     <p>Ideas are particular or general relatively to their object. The ſame diſpoſition of organs which is neceſſary to the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of profound ideas, is likewiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the acquiſition of thoſe which are univerſal: for the univerſality of ideas reſults from the multitude of relations, which the underſtanding perceives, unites and collects into one and the ſame point of view. The faculty of comprehending the ſyſtem of Nature is therefore given only to thoſe, whoſe fibres are endued with force and great organic elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>Another effect of this organization of the body, which we could never have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and ſcarcely believe, although it is demonſtrated, is, that it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to delicacy of ſenſations and ideas.</p>
                     <p>It is an opinion univerſally received by philoſophers, that the ſenſes are perfected by uſe, and that they are improved by ſeeing, feeling, taſting, &amp;c. juſt as the mind is improved by reaſoning.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0658602402:194"/>to exerciſe, to be very erroneous; for exerciſe neither changes the texture of our organs, nor adds to their delicacy. It is true that, by exerciſing the ſenſes, a greater quantity of nervous fluid is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined into their organs, whereby their ſenſibility is increaſed: but he, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to view minute objects for the firſt time, has the organ of ſight equally tenſe with him who is accuſtomed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them at the firſt glance, although he can neither ſee nor remark any thing. It is not therefore to the organ but to the ſoul which receives the ſenſation, that we are to attribute the cauſe of this phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.</p>
                     <p>This pretended delicacy of the ſenſes ariſes only from the attention which the mind gives to the ſmalleſt impreſſions of objects affecting it; for whether we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our organs or not, the delicacy of the ſenſes continues the ſame. But the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0658602402:195"/>mind, being attentive to the ſenſations it receives, gradually becomes able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſmalleſt differences, which are too weak to be perceived by a ſingle effort of the attention. Beſides, it is not in the organs of ſenſe that the ſoul perceives, but in itſelf; there the proſpect of nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts. We muſt therefore look on ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as a tablet, upon which are repreſented the images of the objects which affect us, and wherein the underſtanding perceives them. As theſe repreſentations have parts of aſtronger or weaker colouring, more or leſs luminous, more or leſs diſtinct: ſo ſome of theſe<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. Exerciſe of the Underſtanding.</note> more ſtrongly engage the mind than others; thoſe which are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coloured, and are the repreſentations of very minute objects, are almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible; ſuch are not perceived at firſt ſight, but muſt be ſought for with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before they are found. If a painter perceive at the firſt glance the defects of a painting; if a ſhepherd eaſily diſtinguiſh his ſheep; this proceeds from no other cauſe, than that both are accuſtomed to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0658602402:196"/>turn their attention to theſe objects more frequently than to any other. Thus a very great number of delicate ſenſations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a ſoul united to ſtrong and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic organs, are loſt when united to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans deſtitute both of ſtrength and vigour.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid of the ſenſations is true in regard to ideas likewiſe; for it is only by long continued attention that we can make thoſe delicate obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and acquire thoſe refined ideas which eſcape the generality of men.</p>
                     <p>Thus the difference of the force and elaſticity of our fibres is a new ſource of the diverſity of minds.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have ſeen in what manner the corporeal influences the ſpiritual part, how the conſtitution of the body forms the character of the mind; but we have not yet concluded: let us make further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches into this ſubject, and endeavour to diſcover truths hitherto enveloped with extreme darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>The more we ſtudy the ſoul, the more we trace its progreſs in the exerciſe of its faculties, and the more we examine its operations; the more ſhall be forced

                     <p>In ſleep, all our faculties are in action, although the imagination appears to be the only acting power; but the ſenſations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the thoughts ſucceed each other with rapidity and confuſion, and we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compare nor are conſcious of them: the mind, at that time, in appearance diſengaged from matter, rambles after dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent objects, and from their irregular aſſemblage, forms thoſe empty images which compoſe our nocturnal illuſions.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0658602402:200"/>On the contrary, in inflammatory fevers, when the blood rapidly circulates in the veſſels, the ſenſations and ideas are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked; nevertheleſs they ſucceed each other in confuſion, whilſt the ſoul neither compares nor is conſcious of them. But with perſons both healthy and awake, the ſenſations have a moderate degree of force, the ideas are diſtinct, the ſoul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them, and diſpoſes them in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and orderly ſucceſſion.</p>
                     <p>If we maturely conſider theſe phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, we ſhall diſcover their cauſe to conſiſt in the different tone of the fibres, whilſt aſleep or awake, in a healthy or diſeaſed ſtate of the body. In ſleep, this tone is too feeble to promote the juſtneſs of our thoughts, and the regularity of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; in an inflammatory fever, the tone is, on the contrary, too ſtrong: a regular ſucceſſion of thoughts, therefore, always requires a certain degree of tenſion, or rather a moderate degree of organic elaſticity.</p>
                     <p>As theſe ideas are too ſingular, theſe principles too new, to be received without farther confirmation, I ſhall proceed to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0658602402:201"/>give the cleareſt evidence of their truth. Man has two modes of exiſtence, ſleeping and waking; in this latter every ſpring of the machine is in action; in the former, thoſe only which are allotted for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the vital functions.</p>
                     <p>Sleep is eſſential to Man; it is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence of his conſtitution, and of the laws of the animal oeconomy: by theſe laws he paſſes from a ſleeping to a waking ſtate; by theſe laws likewiſe the time of waking neceſſarily ſucceeds that of repoſe, and both are independant of every external cauſe. For Man can ſubſiſt for a determinate ſpace only, in either of theſe ſtates: by continual watching, the inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant motion of the fibres would deſtroy their organic elaſticity, and prevent their future reparation; ſo by continual ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the fibres are not fatigued, the nervous fluid would be gradually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the action of the organs of life, and would never be repaired.</p>
                     <p>The continuance of either of theſe two modes of exiſtence, would therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be attended with a total ceſſation of vital motion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0658602402:202"/>At the approach of ſleep, the muſcles relax, the neck ſeems unable to ſupport the head, the arms yield to their own weight, the ſenſes become inactive, the whole body ſinks into repoſe, and the blood circulates with a ſlow and gentle pace. By attending to the diſpoſition of the organs of a man aſleep, and to the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena accompanying it, we diſcover, that this ſtate is produced by the defect of the organical elaſticity of the fibres. This relaxation is even ſenſible to the touch, the ſkin of one aſleep being more moiſt, and the fibres ſofter than when awake. But were this relaxation imperceptible by the ſenſes, the ſimple examination of the cauſes of ſleep will be ſufficient to confirm the truth of the principle here eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>It is an inconteſtible fact, that every thing which impairs the organic elaſticity of the fibres, occaſions ſleep; and that every thing which increaſes this elaſticity prevents it. The loſs of nervous fluid in coition is immediately followed by a ſlight drowſineſs: after the conflicts of love, the vivacity of our motions is diminiſhed, our deſires are extinct, and we gradually ſink into repoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0658602402:203"/>The loſs of the ſame fluid by labour produces the ſame effect.</p>
                     <p>Though this loſs of the nervous fluid be a principal cauſe of ſleep, it is not the only one; let us repair it ever ſo much by freſh ſupplies of aliments, ſleep will not be the leſs neceſſary; this may prevent it for a ſhort time, but afterwards ſuffers it to return with new force. Thus the loſs of nervous fluid is not alone produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it; ſince, not being exhauſted of this fluid, Man ſleeps not the leſs; ſleep therefore is occaſioned by a diſpoſition pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the ſolids; and this diſpoſition is no other than the laſſitude of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, produced by the tenſion of the fibres when awake, or by the reiterated extenſion and contraction of the muſcles in motion.</p>
                     <p>Sleep therefore is cauſed by the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the organic elaſticity of the ſolids, and by the diminution of their primitive elaſticity; for it is certain, that an elaſtic body loſes its primitive elaſticity by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent contraction. The fibres, after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme tenſion, relax, and their organic elaſticity being impaired, the circulation
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0658602402:204"/>is ſlowly performed, the ſecretion of the nervous fluid is obſtructed, as likewiſe its influx into the organs of ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence reſult a diminution of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, a weakneſs, and a general languor of the ſenſations, deſires and ideas<note n="*" place="bottom">See a preceding Art. the diſpoſition of the ſoul is ever congruous to that of the body.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Although all communication between the ſoul and the body appears interrupted during ſleep, theſe two ſubſtances however have a conſtant relation one to the other. The ſenſes are ever open to the action of external objects, and their ſlighteſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are conveyed to the ſoul; but too weak to engage it, they only glance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without leaving any veſtige behind; ſtrong ſenſations only can awaken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it. Theſe are phenomena peculiar to ſleep, and proper to confirm what has been already ſaid concerning its cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe truths however are ſupported by other phenomena. The fibres of perſons greatly diſpoſed to ſleep are feeble, and it is by ſleep that our exiſtence commences. The infant, whoſe fibres are endued but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0658602402:205"/>with a very ſmall degree of organic elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity, ſleeps continually; children, whoſe fibres are very weak, ſleep more than they wake; in proportion as they advance in years, that is, in proportion as their fibres acquire ſtrength and elaſticity, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure more eaſily the want of repoſe; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, leſs ſtrong and leſs vigorous than men, have likewiſe more occaſion for ſleep. Phlegmatic men<note n="*" place="bottom">It is remarked, that geldings are leſs vigorous than horſes, and likewiſe ſleep more.</note>, whoſe fibres have but a ſmall degree of organic elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, conſume the half of life in that ſtate, and people, when recovering from any diſeaſe, ſleep almoſt continually.</p>
                     <p>Another cauſe is, that every thing which impairs the force of the circulation by decreaſing the elaſticity of the fibres, as heat, emollient liquors, and whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbs the ſolids, as ſulphureous vapours, ſpirituous liquors and opium, ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſleep.</p>
                     <p>In ſubjects which have died of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, or of any ſleepy diſeaſe, we find the head diſordered, and the other parts ſound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0658602402:206"/>Bonet<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Sepuleretum Anatomicum.</note>, who has collected a vaſt number of obſervations of this kind, <q>found a great quantity of extravaſated ſeroſities in the brain of one who had died of a lethargy, ſo that the <hi>cortical ſubſtance</hi> and the <hi>meninges</hi> were covered therewith. In another ſubject, that had never been attacked but once with any ſleepy affection, the internal part of the <hi>cerebrum</hi> was full of extravaſated ſeroſities. In others, he found ſcir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſes and tumours in the <hi>cortical</hi> part of this <hi>viſcus.</hi> Finally, in ſome that had been affected with an habitual le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, the ſubſtance of the brain was found dry, and the veſſels of the <hi>pia mater</hi> extremely diſtended with thick and grumous blood.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe obſervations prove, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual numbneſs is cauſed by the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or even by the total ſuppreſſion of the influx of the nervous fluid into the organs of motion and ſenſe; a natural effect of its vicious ſecretion, during the diſtenſion of the cortical ſubſtance of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0658602402:207"/>brain, of the defect of the oſcillatory motion of the diſtended <hi>meninges,</hi> of the compreſſion of the medullary ſubſtance by the extravaſated ſeroſities, or the defect of this fluid as in a ſiccity of the brain. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is well known, that the ſimple preſſure of this <hi>viſcus,</hi> after the removal of the <hi>cranium,</hi> produces ſleep, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the influx of the nervous fluid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the origin of the nerves, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by weakening the organic elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the fibres, as the preceding cauſes<note n="*" place="bottom">I have many times experienced this after the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Trepan: the ſlight preſſure on the brain ever produced an obſcurity of ſight and a noiſe in the ears; a preſſure ſomewhat more ſtrong was followed by drowſineſs, and afterwards by perfect ſleep; all theſe ſymptoms ceaſed upon diſcontinuing the preſſure.</note>. But the moſt concluſive reaſon is, that ſleep cannot take place whilſt the body is violently agitated, either by a fever, or by any violent paſſion, equally capable of producing a tenſion of the fibres.</p>
                     <p>If the relaxation of the fibres be the cauſe of ſleep, the re-eſtabliſhment of their organic elaſticity by repoſe muſt be the cauſe of waking. This cauſe, which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0658602402:208"/>is neceſſarily deduced from the nature of things, I ſhall demonſtrate by its pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</p>
                     <p>On the concluſion of undiſturbed ſleep, the fibres inſenſibly become more tenſe, the complexion more lively, the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more quick, the impreſſions of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on the ſenſes more ſtrong, and the ſoul again communicates with external objects. When we have once fallen into a deep ſleep, we are not awakened from it but by very lively ſenſations; but when the uſual ſpace of time allotted for reſt is nearly expired, the leaſt noiſe awakes us, and ever more eaſily, the nearer we are to the hour of awaking: ſo that the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſleep is ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from waking, and its laſt degree is confounded therewith. Sleep, therefore, comes on and goes off by inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; ſimilar, in this reſpect, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of night, which gradually increaſes till it arrives at midnight darkneſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards decreaſes by the ſame gradation. Let us therefore conclude, that the fibres poſſeſs a greater degree of organic elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in Man when awake than when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0658602402:209"/>It is then obvious, that whilſt the fibres are relaxed, there is no regular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoughts; the mind paſſes without any regularity over the ſenſations it has received, its thoughts ſucceed each other in confuſion; and, if at any time they form a regular ſeries, it is only whilſt the fibres are tenſe. In the agitations of a painful dream, the thoughts are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what regular; but in the mean time, Man is greatly diſturbed, and, when he afterwards awakes, finds himſelf oppreſſed with fatigue, and wet with ſweat and tears.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is only by the relaxation of the organic elaſticity of our fibres, that ſleep interrupts the ſucceſſion of our ideas; the order of our thoughts therefore depends on the ſtate of the body.</p>
                     <p>I imagine, the proofs already offered in ſupport of this will be found ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concluſive; but that no proof may be wanting, and that the principle may be incontrovertibly eſtabliſhed, let us examine the ſtate of the body relatively to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the ideas in madmen, thoſe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples of the vagaries, or, if you will, of the rovings of this diſtempered ſtate of human reaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0658602402:210"/>There are many ſpecies of madneſs, in every one of which the mind forms wrong judgments of things. In each ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of madneſs, ſenſations and ideas of every kind are produced, but have neither order nor connexion; and in this incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſucceſſion, in this chaos of ſenſations and thoughts, the will acts not, but lets the images of things ſucceed each other in diſorder. Attention not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtrong, the ſoul is not conſcious of its thoughts; ſo that illuſion is often admitted amongſt, and intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them.</p>
                     <p>This, however, may be obſerved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſeveral ſpecies of madneſs; that ſtate of the ſoul, which is accidental in the one, is natural and conſtant in the other ſorts: but all equally reſult from an ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to attend; this inability I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to be wholly dependent on the conſtitution of the body.</p>
                     <p>Phyſiologiſts have ſought in dead ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals the cauſes of this diſordered ſtate of the ſoul in living animals, as if it proceeded from the unnatural confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome organ, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0658602402:211"/>always exiſt, never dreaming that it might be occaſioned by ſome change in the organic elaſticity of the ſolids, the only principle by which theſe phenomena can be explained. A ſtriking example of the ill-ſucceſs of moſt phyſiological en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and a proof that our efforts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover truth ſerve often to miſlead us, and to remove us to a great diſtance from it!</p>
                     <p>By comparing the ſtate of the body of one that died in perfect enjoyment of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with that of one who died in a ſtate of madneſs, we ſhall undoubtedly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many conſiderable differences; ſuch as the diſtenſion of the veſſels of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges;</hi> the inflammation of theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; the extravaſation of lymph into the <hi>ſinuſes</hi> of the brain; the ſiccity of this <hi>viſcus,</hi> and of the origin of the nerves; appearances commonly ſeen in the bodies of the latter, but never in thoſe of the former. This difference, which is here ſuppoſed to be the cauſe, is only the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Conſidered as the effect, it may conduct us to the knowledge of the true principle; but in our enquiries we ſhall proceed with greater ſucceſs, by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0658602402:212"/>the ſtate of the ſolids of a man in perfect reaſon, with that of the ſolids of one who has loſt it.</p>
                     <p>The different ſpecies of madneſs may be reduced to two; which are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed not by thoſe vagaries of reaſon which are common to both, but by the character of the thoughts; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned under two general denominations; furious madneſs, when the thoughts are daring, and the emotions of the ſoul vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>inſanity</hi> or <hi>idiotiſm,</hi> when the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul and the thoughts are weakly expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>There is a rigidity of the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, when the rovings of the ſoul are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fury, as in frenzy, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fevers, drunkenneſs, and the hyſteric affection; there is a debilitation thereof, when the ſame rovings are indicated in a tranquil and languid manner, as in inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, dotage, and in that melancholy madneſs, which is occaſioned by the uſe of narcotics. Every one may be convinced of this, by ſimply inſpecting a body in theſe different ſtates, and by examining the phenomena.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0658602402:213"/>With regard to that affection of the mind which is produced by drunkenneſs, it is obvious, that ſpirituous liquors are peculiarly adapted to produce a rigidity in the fibres.</p>
                     <p>The ſaline particles with which theſe liquors are impregnated, and the ſpirits with which they abound, when received into the ſtomach, firſt irritate its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and, being conveyed into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, irritate their coats: this irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is immediately followed by a ſpaſm of theſe organs, propagated through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, by the correſpondence of the nervous ſyſtem which affects every part, but more eſpecially the <hi>meninges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This violent tenſion of the meninges is preſently after produced in a more direct manner: the ſalts and the ſpirits gradually paſs into the fluids, and, being conveyed to the brain with the blood, increaſe the tenſion of its membranes, and the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rendered more impetuous. This violent ſpaſm, at intervals, compreſſes the cavity of the nerves, and interrupts, in whole or in part, the perflux of their fluid:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0658602402:214"/>hence proceed thoſe irregular and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions of the muſcles, that ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and total loſs of ſenſe and motion, obſerved in perſons who have died in a ſtate of inebriation. By comparing the tone of the ſolids of a drunkard, with that of the ſolids of a temperate perſon, we find the fibres moderately tenſe in the latter, and extremely ſo in the former. In drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, the countenance appears inflamed, the eyes red and fiery, the veſſels of the face diſtended, the limbs at firſt are flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, afterwards they are ſtiff and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed; the regularity of muſcular motion is deſtroyed, the body is unſtable, the ſenſes are dull, the ſight is troubled, and the objects looked upon ſeem to waver. Here, if we may judge by the ſenſes, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme tenſion of the fibres, which very nearly approaches to rigidity, and this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidity is proved on the teſtimony of facts.</p>
                     <p>If this ſpaſm be ſo viſible in the ſtrong and groſs organs, what muſt it be in the fibres of the <hi>meninges,</hi> which are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more delicate and more ſenſible!</p>
                     <p>The effects, which are produced in the ſolids in drunkenneſs, by the irritating

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0658602402:218"/>even to the membranes of the brain, where it ſometimes leaves viſible marks of irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>In ſubjects which have died of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fevers or of madneſs, many ramifications of the <hi>meninges</hi> have been found diſtended, and theſe membranes themſelves inflamed<note n="*" place="bottom">See Miſcellan. Curioſ, Nat. dec. 2. pag. 234. Anno 6. &amp; dec. 2. pag. 162. Anno 4.</note>; in others have been diſcovered many ſanious ſeroſities in the ventricles of the brain, many veſicles, or rather <hi>varices</hi> full of ſanious lymph, and the <hi>plexus choroides</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed: in others the veſſels of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges</hi> were livid and full of thick blood, many ſeroſities were found in the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the brain, and a livid polypous concretion in the <hi>ſinus falci-formis;</hi> the other parts of the body were ſound, the brain alone being affected.</q> This dilatation of the blood veſſels, theſe <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rices,</hi> theſe diſtenſions, theſe extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſanious ſeroſities, and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the membranes of the brain, are evidently the effects of violent, irregular,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0658602402:219"/>and obſtructed circulation, occaſioned by the ſpaſm of the nervous ſyſtem, and of the ſolids in general. For when a part is affected with a ſpaſm, the veſſels of which it is compoſed are violently contracted; and as the coats of the arteries are more ſtrong than thoſe of the veins, ſo much the more they reſiſt their contraction; the blood continues to flow on to that part with eaſe, but in its return is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; whereby it accumulates in theſe veſſels, and exceſſively diſtends them: hence theſe inflammations, diſtenſions and <hi>varices.</hi> When the diſtenſion is extreme, the veſſels permit their contained fluid to permeate their coats: hence thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſations of the lymph, blood, and thoſe polypous excreſcences which proceed therefrom. Finally, if we obſerve that cauſtic acrids, as the <hi>hyoſciamum, ſolanum verum,</hi> and generally every thing that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritates the nerves and renders them rigid, either taken internally or applied outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, produce the moſt terrible delirium and madneſs; whilſt lenients and antiſpaſmodic medicines reſtore reaſon, we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that this perturbed ſtate of the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0658602402:220"/>mind is wholly produced by the ſpaſm of the nervous ſyſtem, but more eſpecially by that of the membranes of the brain. Hence it is evident, that furious madneſs proceeds from a rigidity of the fibres; I ſhall now ſhew that inſanity or idiotiſm is occaſioned by their relaxation.</p>
                     <p>Inſanity often ſucceeds madneſs, and that inſtantaneouſly; this phenomenon is very natural, as the violent tenſion of the fibres muſt be followed by their relaxation: when this debilitation is conſiderable, and the organic elaſticity of the fibres is ſo greatly impaired, that it requires ſome conſiderable time before it can be reſtored, the mind recovers not the tone adapted for reaſon; it only changes the ſpecies of its folly. This is more particularly obſerved in inflammatory fevers, where furious madneſs opens the diſeaſe, and idiotiſm concludes it. Whilſt the nerves are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſed, and the circulation is vehement, Man acts with violence, his ideas are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, he loſes all knowledge, and utters, with a furious aſpect, incoherent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: but when the morbid humours have taken another courſe, when the black
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0658602402:221"/>poiſon which occaſions his diſeaſe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from his veſſels; weakened by the violence his tranſports, he remains a long time deſtitute of ſtrength, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of reaſon, inſenſible either of the evil or danger of his condition, and is reduced to a ſtate of infancy, which is of ſo much the longer duration, andthe debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litation of the elaſticity of his fibres is more extreme; for in theſe caſes the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is ever equal to the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>To the foregoing may be added the analogy between the diſpoſition of the ſoul and body during ſleep, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of theſe two ſubſtances during in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanity. For this ſtate of the ſoul, whilſt Man is awake, perfectly correſponds to that whilſt Man is aſleep; the ſucceſſion of ſenſations is the ſame; the exerciſe of thinking, and the action of the organs are the ſame likewiſe; in both, the fibres are relaxed, and the circulation languid: whence it appears, that theſe two ſtates have ſimilar cauſes.</p>
                     <p>This kind of inſanity is oftentimes produced by exceſſive ſtudy, by violent paſſions, by a conſiderable loſs of ſemen,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0658602402:222"/>and by every thing which debilitates the organic elaſticity of the fibres. This is confirmed by comparative anatomy: for the ſtate of dotage, that is, when the ſenſations and ideas are combined without order, is preciſely the ſame as when the body is feeble, the ſtrength is exhauſted, and the organs are inelaſtic. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obvious, that this alienation of mind is the effect of the extreme impairing of the organic elaſticity of our ſolids</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Furious madneſs proceeds from the rigidity of the fibres; idiotiſm or inſanity from their relaxation; and the ſlate adapted for reaſon from their moderate elaſticity:</hi> ſuch are the ſecret cauſes of the order which obtains in our thoughts. Hence it appears, that a greater or leſs degree of tenſion of the fibres can make a man either rational or inſane. Reaſon and madneſs muſt therefore depend on the mechaniſm of the body, and not in the leaſt on the ſoul, as philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have falſely ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>Having contemplated theſe rovings of the ſoul, and diſcovered their cauſes in the different tones of the fibres, let us proceed to aſſign the reaſon of theſe phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0658602402:223"/>A regular ſeries of thoughts ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, in order to its formation, that the mind be intent on the object of its judgments; this intenſeneſs of the mind is ever accompanied by that of the body. During meditation, the pulſe beats more ſtrongly than when we do not meditate, and ſo much the more ſtrongly, as the ſoul is the more deeply engaged in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus in cataleptics, whilſt the ſoul is involved in the moſt profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, the blood circulates with greater freedom and force, the complexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more lively, reſpiration more free, and every function of the body is more perfectly performed. During meditation the whole body is violently tenſe, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>plexus nervoſi,</hi> and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the brain.</p>
                     <p>Too great or too long application in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes this tenſion, even ſo far as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a ſtupor in the head, and kindle up a fever in the veins: ſtudious perſons fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experience this, I myſelf have, many times.</p>
                     <p>The ſoul, during meditation, not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the body with a degree of tenſion, but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0658602402:224"/>without its concurrence cannot operate alone. In chronic diſeaſes, during a ſtate of convaleſcence, and after a conſiderable loſs of ſemen, we can neither reflect nor meditate, whatever efforts we make; we think very little, and our ideas are vague and unconnected. Even immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profound meditation, the mind being fatigued, indulges itſelf in roving, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the will oppoſe; we indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to think, but our thoughts are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irregular; we remain awake, but experience the effects of ſleep; imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion traces the ſame airy ſemblances, the ſame fugitive ſhades as during ſleep.</p>
                     <p>No regular ſeries of thoughts can be formed without a tenſion of the fibres: this tenſion has fixed bounds, determined limits, beyond which the ſucceſſion of our ideas cannot proceed. When the fibres are too tenſe, as in drunkenneſs, in fevers, and in violent head aches, let us ever ſo much attempt to reflect, all our efforts are vain, the ſoul is either in a <hi>delirium</hi> or in a <hi>ſtupor.</hi> It has been proved, that in regular thought the underſtanding<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. Exerciſe of the underſtanding.</note> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0658602402:225"/>to the will; that this exerciſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon requires a certain tone of the ſolids; and that the tone of the ſolids neceſſary to reaſon has a certain extent: this tone, therefore, muſt be conſtantly exiſtent in Man, whilſt his organs are obedient to the will; but is not found either in a ſtate of rigidity or relaxation, two ſtates of the fibres which have this in common, that they both equally free the body from ſubjection to the will.</p>
                     <p>If we notice the power which certain aliments, fruits, and liquors have on the body, we ſhall be convinced that it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, or at leaſt equal to that of the ſoul over the material ſubſtance to which it is united. Again, if we compare the empire of the different faculties of the ſoul over the body, we ſhall be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book III. Obſ. 62.</note>, that the power of ſenſibility is much greater than that of the will, and incomparably more ſo than that of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or imagination. That of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and imagination is univerſal; that is, it influences both the muſcular fibres and their <hi>fibrillae,</hi> the organs of ſenſe and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0658602402:226"/>motion; whilſt that of the will is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the latter of theſe only. But none of theſe faculties has any power over the body, but by the nervous fluid; when this is deficient, or when it has loſt its energy, or even when the elaſticity of the fibres is impaired, it is obvious, that the power of the will is at an end. Even when this fluid is violently impelled into the muſcular fibres, either by ſenſibilty or by ſome other cauſe, with greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity than the will can impel it; it is evident, that the rigidity is not removed, but confirmed thereby, if it proceed from a violent influx of the nervous fluid into the fibres.</p>
                     <p>Hence the reaſon why the violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as rage, fear, terror, affect us with a kind of momentary madneſs; why the efforts we make to reflect, when fatigued by meditation, only ſerve to increaſe our inability to think; in a word, why the rigidity and total relaxation of the ſolids deprive the ſoul of the free exerciſe of its faculties, and are the cauſes of madneſs, the degree and force whereof is proportioned to that of their principle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0658602402:227"/>Let us therefore conclude, that <hi>as the mind cannot act alone, it ever requires the concurrence of the corporeal organs to reflect and meditate, and that the unfolding of its faculties entirely depends upon organzation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have now only to offer a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ſubſequent phenomena, to confirm what has been ſaid on the ſame ſubject elſewhere<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. Some ſingular phenomena ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, concerning the effects of the paſſions on the underſtanding.</note>. Certain hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacs ſee viſions at mid-day, and with their eyes open: ſome fancy they behold a continued ſeries of phantoms and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpectres, rapidly ſucceeding each other; others, a ſeries of agreeable objects, flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhades, female forms, magnificent ſcenes, which offer themſelves in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and are ſeen like objects really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting; ſo that the deception of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary repreſentations is ſo ſtrong, that they believe them to be realities.</p>
                     <p>When ſpeaking of the colourings which the ſentiments of the ſoul communicate to objects, and of the illuſions of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0658602402:228"/>analogous to the facts related above, I obſerved, that phyſiologiſts had attributed theſe phenomena to the nervous fluid; and that, to account for it, they had imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>that this fluid, which is naturally ſubject to the empire of the ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes its ſuperior in theſe affections; that in the organ of ſight particularly, it aſſumes every ſucceſſive modification repreſentative of objects, which had before affected it.</q> I demonſtrated, that phyſiologiſts improperly confound the operations of the ſenſes with thoſe of the mind; I likewiſe proved this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to be very ſimple, and only myſterious from our miſapprehenſion of it. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve now, as I did then, that theſe viſions of hypochondriacs are only ſenſations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed from the memory, the empty phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a ſoul violently agitated, wholly engroſſed and miſled by its pleaſures or its pains, and unable to return within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to examine objects.</p>
                     <p>I have already proved, that the ſoul, when ſtrongly affected by any object, is blind to every other, it being no longer able to attend thereto; I ſhall now offer a phyſical reaſon of this phenomenon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0658602402:229"/>It is only by attention, that we can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh in the ſoul the real impreſſions of things from ſenſations re-produced. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the preſence of mind neceſſary to reflection, requires in the fibres a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of tenſion, the <hi>medium</hi> between rigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and relaxation. In inflammatory fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and in the hypochondriac diſeaſe, there is the ſame rigidity as in the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſtomach, contracted by the uſe of ſome acrid aliment, or by poiſon: for the irritation of this <hi>viſcus</hi> affects the whole nervous ſyſtem, and more eſpecially the membranes of the brain. In all theſe caſes, reaſon is extinct; for the will has no longer any power over the organs, as has been already ſhewn. Thus, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to itſelf, the mind employs itſelf in reviewing the objects which formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it; but wanting the attention ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to diſcern whether their image be re-produced or not, it miſtakenly imagines them preſent, and really exiſting.</p>
                     <p>When the ſpaſm ceaſes, the mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly recovers its reaſon, theſe imaginary objects diſappear, the deception ceaſes, the patient finds himſelf in his chamber,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0658602402:230"/>ſurrounded by his diſconſolate friends, and relates to them the ſubject of his viſions.</p>
                     <p>The ſame effects which are produced by acrid humours on the body in ſevers, and by irritating aliments in the inflammation of the ſtomach, are likewiſe produced by an inflamed imagination, and by violent paſſions; examples, which confirm this, daily occur to our obſervation.</p>
                     <p>When the ſoul is engroſſed by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, when the imagination forms a lively picture of the charms of a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite object, repreſents it as the idol of the heart, adorns it with every attractive grace, and ſuffers it to make a deep impreſſion on the mind; by degrees the charms, in which we have cloathed and decked it, dazzle the ſight, and impoſe even on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: then wholly engaged thereby, we are inſenſible to every other object, and miſled fo theſe phantoms, we take our viſions for realities.</p>
                     <p>Thus, in the extreme anxieties of a ſoul tormented by remorſe, the guilty wretch continually revolves in his mind every crime he has committed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a miſerable victim to deſpair. Should
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0658602402:231"/>ſleep cloſe his eyes; his ſleep is only a frightful <hi>delirium,</hi> the conſciouſneſs of his crimes preys upon his heart, and terrifies him with horrid viſions. He dreams he hears the groans of thoſe he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, thinks he ſees their ghoſts riſing from their tombs, and imprecating the juſtice of heaven on him; the darkneſs of hell covers the face of the earth, the furies hiſs in his ears, ſhake their torches at him, and purſue and haunt him wherever he goes; devils, fiends, every moniter in fable beſet his ſoul; harraſſed with theſe horrible viſions, the wretch awakes in affright, vents loud cries, ſtarts back with horror at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his friends, whom now he knows not, and claſps the next thing he finds in his arms, and fancies he clings to the altar.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is that the paſſions produce viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and trances; thus it is that enthuſiaſm is changed into a delirium, and thus it is that fanatic minds ſometimes fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſpired.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe on the ſucceſſion of our ideas, and the order which obtains in our
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0658602402:232"/>thoughts, recalls me to the point from whence I firſt ſet out. I then proved that the depth, the juſtneſs and ſublimity of ideas, required fibres ſtrong and greatly elaſtic, and that theſe characters of our ideas varied together with the organization: but the different degrees of the ſtrength and elaſticity of theſe organs in different individuals, which at firſt appeared of ſo little conſequence, produce other very ſurpriſing effects. This principle, ſimple as it is, abounds in conſequences; it is this which enables us to diſcover truths, hitherto concealed from the learned, and involved in profound darkneſs. Let us endeavour to draw from this hidden ſource ſome additional knowledge, which may throw light on ſome very obſcure ſubjects, and ſcatter flowers over the thorny paths of philoſophy.</p>

                     <p>The exerciſe of regular thought is to the mind, what voluntary motion is to the body; that is, a ſtate of conſtraint which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0658602402:233"/>the ſoul commonly yields to with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ever endures with pain.</p>
                     <p>If we follow the mind in its operations, we ſhall obſerve, that when abandoned to its own activity, it acts without rule and without method; it never acts with order, but when neceſſity<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II.

Regular thought conſidered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively to the degree of attention which it requires.</note> obliges it thereto, and returns to its former ſtate immediately, when freed from reſtraint. What renders the regular exerciſe of thought more fatiguing than the irregular, is the attention which it requires; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of fixing objects in the mind, in order to conſider them<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note> without diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the efforts which are neceſſary to diſcern their different relations; efforts ſo much the more painful as the objects happen to be naturally volatile, and fall not within the cognizance of the ſenſes. But what renders theſe efforts painful, is that tenſion of the fibres which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs of the mind requires; for the tenſion of the fibres ever produces in the ſoul an unpleaſing ſentiment more or leſs
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0658602402:234"/>ſtrong, but ever proportionate to its force. We muſt therefore conſtantly recur to phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical cauſes, to account for theſe phenomena of the mind.</p>
                     <p>By following the mind in its operations, it is eaſy to diſcover, that when it ceaſes to conſider objects attentively, it no longer judges of their true relations; in this caſe thought becomes imagination. Thus, of all the ſciences, geometry requires the leaſt aid from imagination, as it continually fixes the attention on one particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not that he who diſcovers a demonſtration has no occaſion for invention; but that the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being once diſcovered, others have only to purſue it: only the inventor of a ſcience has occaſion to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; thoſe who ſucceed him have no more to do than to repeat his reaſonings.</note>.</p>
                     <p>I have demonſtrated, that regular thought fatigues the mind much more<note n="†" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. Regular thought conſidered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively to the degrees of attention which it requires.</note>, and much ſooner than revery; I have likewiſe ſhewn, that when the mind is fatigued, it no longer fixes upon any object, and ceaſes to conſider attentively<note n="‡" place="bottom">Book III.

                     <p>The tranſition from reaſon to imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very eaſy. If the mind, during reflection, be diſtracted by any ſenſation, it loſes ſight of its objects, is engaged by ſome analogous relation, and wanders from one to another, till it entirely loſes its firſt engagement; it at length perceives itſelf bewildered in the labyrinths of imagination, even whilſt it fancies it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf attentively purſuing its former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. The greater the ſenſibility, the more difficult it is to prevent theſe wanderings: <hi>whence it follows, that the Man whoſe organs are delicate and greatly ſenſible muſt poſſeſs more imagination than judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the tranſition from reaſon to imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be very eaſy, it is likewiſe very
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0658602402:236"/>natural. Whatever our thoughts may be' ſome ſecret attractive, ſome hidden charm, recalls the mind to its favourite ſubject. The ſoul, ever delighted with pleaſing ſentiments, reſigns itſelf wholly thereto, and its natural love of happineſs prompts it to perpetuate the pleaſure it takes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

                     <p>When the exerciſe of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is wholly imagination, the nature of its images and ideas is ever determined<note n="*" place="bottom">This is very evident in the <hi>furor uterinus,</hi> a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe produced by the irritating quality of the ſemen, depraved by a too long continuance in the ſecretory veſſels, and in the <hi>incubus</hi> or night-mare.</note> by that of the ſenſation or ſentiment, then affecting the mind. If this ſentiment or ſenſation be agreeable, there is a ſeries of pleaſing illuſions and agreeable images: if painful, there is a ſucceſſion of ſad and hideous repreſentations. The ſame phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon is alſo evident during ſleep: our dreams are pleaſing or terrifying, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſenſations we then experience.</p>
                     <p>If we take a retroſpective view of what we have ſaid concerning the ſucceſſion of our ideas, when ſpeaking of the exerciſe of our mental faculties, we ſhall find this phenomenon very ſimple. The mind, if left to itſelf, ever proceeds by analogies: the thoughts therefore muſt be gay, when the ſoul is affected with pleaſure, and ſad when affected with pain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0658602402:238"/>The impreſſions received by the organs of the body are conveyed to the ſoul, fix there, and ſerve as a point of departure, from whence it ſets out when it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces its future operations; from this time forwards it is engaged by analogous images and analogous thoughts only.</p>
                     <p>And as the ſoul ever perceives the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body during ſleep, although it appears to be then freed from its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the ſenſes; the ſame analogy muſt be obſerved in man aſleep, as when awake. Hence the reaſon why the nature of dreams is ever analogous to the ſtate of the body, and to the ſenſation then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the mind. Hence too, the reaſon why, when the ſenſation is agreeable, we enjoy during ſleep a ſeries of pleaſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and agreeable images; but, when it is painful, are terrified with diſmal thoughts and frightful illuſions.</p>
                     <p>What has been ſaid above concerning the imagination, is properly applicable to irregular thought only; its regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions require the ſame phyſical diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which reaſon does.</p>
                     <p>The mind muſt compare and combine its ſenſations and its thoughts in many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0658602402:239"/>ſhapes, to form new productions therefrom; this requires attention, and conſequently force and elaſticity in the fibres. <hi>Thus imagination is weakened by degrees, together with the organic elaſticity of the fibres: in proportion as they become more lax or more rigid, the mind cannot compare or combine its ſenſations, and becomes inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; even ſo far as to be no longer able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imagine or to invent;</hi> it then ceaſes to draw conſequences from principles, and only acts by the aid of the ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if regular imagination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the elaſticity of our organs, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it in a leſs degree than reaſon; for its objects are neither neceſſarily depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on each other, nor cloſely connected its productions are only detached parts, where the mind has nothing to do but to weave them into one tiſſue. Finally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their connection depends not on the combination of a great number of thoughts or ideas which are naturally profound and difficult to be inveſtigated, as thoſe of reaſon commonly are; a ſingle ſtroke of the pencil ſhall frequently ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the parts of which the group is to be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0658602402:240"/>compoſed. And although regular imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be a ſtate of conſtraint like reaſon, it nevertheleſs fatigues the ſoul much leſs; for imagination has ever the choice of its ſubjects, and this choice is ever directed towards agreeable objects; whilſt reaſon, ever tied down to follow nature, muſt needs frequently find an irkſomeneſs from painful reſearches and dry reflections, and is ever buſied in a diſguſtful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Imagination therefore not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires leſs attention than reaſon, but alſo poſſeſſes many pleaſing attractives beſides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Imagination requires leſs force of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans than reaſon, but a greater ſhare of organic elaſticity of the fibres, or rather a greater ſhare of ſenſibility.</hi> For it is not always by a careful examination of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor by a ſeries of many ſucceſſive combinations, that the imagination forms new productions: the moſt happy ſtrokes of fancy often preſent themſelves to the mind ſpontaneouſly, when we leaſt think, and are never the fruit of pains or plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It is therefore only by vaiouſly combining objects, by leaving (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) the mind to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0658602402:241"/>rove at will, and by employing no more attention than is neceſſary to collect the reſult of its thoughts, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect therefrom ſuch as are for its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The greater our ſenſibility, the more liable we are to diſtraction, the more affected by analogies, the leſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to material objects, and the more capable of thoſe happy, but fortuitous combinations, the true ſource of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſallies, and of the nobleſt produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the human mind.</p>
                     <p>Thus therefore men who have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſenſibility, and are of robuſt organs, can poſſeſs but a ſmall ſhare of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: men, who are but little ſenſible, and yet delicate, muſt poſſeſs more. They, who are feeble and of great ſenſibility, yet greater: and they who are extremely vigorous and extremely ſenſible, moſt of all. Eager to riſe above the ſphere of the ſenſes, theſe can alone ſoar above this low world, and with a bold wing traverſing the boundleſs tracts of aether tranſport themſelves to worlds unexplored before.</p>
                     <p>I have proved, that reaſon is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the ſoul, and that the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <p>The microcephali, whoſe brain is of ſmaller dimenſions than common, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſtitute of theſe faculties.</p>
                     <p>Finally, in the hiſtory of the academy of ſciences of Paris, Année 1701, pag. 57. we find the caſe of a child, eight years of age, that loſt its<note n="†" place="bottom">Even here remembrance and recollection are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as I obſerved above, although the term memory be made uſe of.</note> memory by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heats of ſummer, and never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it whilſt the heats continued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0658602402:244"/>Since the influence of the body on the ſoul has fixed and conſtant relations, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and loſs of remembrance or recollection are therefore produced by cauſes common to every inſtance abovementioned. By what theſe caſes have in common, it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the cauſe of this decay, and loſs of theſe powers, is only the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the organic elaſticity of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem, but more eſpecially of the membranes of the brain; a diminution common to every ſubject here noticed, but produced in different ways. In the one, by a defect of the nervous fluid, as in <hi>microcephali,</hi> and thoſe who have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by immoderate coition: in others, by a violent tenſion of the fibres, as in apoplectics, thoſe who have been recalled to life after hanging, and thoſe who have under gone the operation of the trepan: in others, by theſe two cauſes united, as in perſons affected with acute or chronic diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall be fully convinced of this truth, if we conſider, that every thing which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the tone of the ſolids, either by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating the ſecretion of the nervous fluid in the brain, or reſtraining its action, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0658602402:245"/>the ſame effect. The immoderate uſe of cooling liquors, ſpirits, <hi>opium, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſciamum,</hi> and other narcotics, long and profound ſadneſs, fear, terror, and every other violent paſſion of the ſoul, too long continued watching, and too profound me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, all which are adapted to deſtroy the elaſticity of the fibres, occaſion the loſs of remembrance and recollection. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the decay, and even the loſs of theſe powers, are often occaſioned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat; in this caſe, it is viſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the diminution of organic elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Every thing concurs to eſtabliſh the loſs of elaſticity, as the cauſe of this phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon, as I have obſerved, in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different obſervations made upon this ſubject, and reducing to fixed points their numerous variations.</p>
                     <p>If more proofs were required, I would here repeat what has been ſaid elſewhere concerning the order of our thoughts. On the approach of ſleep, and at the cloſe of weariſome meditation, when the fibres relax and the circulation is languid, when the ſenſes are inactive and every organ is at reſt, the ſoul appears to be then detached from the body, and wanders without any
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0658602402:246"/>ſcope; remembrance is loſt, we recollect nothing, not even things which are the moſt familiar. When ſleep cloſes the eyes, objects which affect us whilſt awake are retraced in the mind, but the mind remembers them not, and this forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo much the more extreme as the ſleep is more profound, that is, as the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres are more relaxed; the mind recovers not theſe powers, till the elaſticity of the fibres is re-eſtabliſhed by repoſe.</p>
                     <p>But if the loſs of remembrance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection be often produced by the relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the fibres; it is ſometimes occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by their rigidity. In inflammatory fevers, in drunkenneſs, nothing is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, nothing recollected. How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are ſeen perſons when affected with either of theſe, that know not their friends, children, wives, and even forget their own name! How many have been reduced to the ſame miſerable ſtate from the irritation of the meninges by ſplinters of the <hi>crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or by ſome extraneous body!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Remembrance and recollection, therefore, require a moderate degree of tenſion of the fibres, as does the regular exerciſe of thought.</hi>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0658602402:247"/>The reaſon of this phenomenon is eaſily comprehended. Memory is a paſſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but remembrance and recollection are the<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book II. Art. Of recollection and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</note> reſults of our ſeveral intellectual faculties combined. The one is the ſtate of reflecting on the ſenſations and the ideas depoſited in the memory: the other is a ſtate of intenſeneſs, by which the ſoul forces itſelf to recall theſe ſenſations and theſe ideas. Remembrance and recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore of neceſſity require atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently a moderate degree of organic elaſticity in the fibres. It is therefore obvious, that when the ſubjects of our obſervations have not the power of rendering the fibres tenſe, the mind is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of theſe powers.</p>
                     <p>Hence we muſt conclude, that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and recollection are determined by the tone of the ſolids, and even depend on organization.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have ſhown how the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of the elaſticity of the fibres contribute to the diverſity of minds, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0658602402:248"/>how this mechaniſm explains theſe phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, reconciles them to Nature, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, and diveſts them of the marvellous; this cauſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſimple it may appear, produces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other very ſurpriſing effects.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Penetration depends on the number of the ſenſes, and their good organization;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not wholly thereon. To diſcover the relations of things, it is not ſufficient to have a great number of ſenſations, there is alſo neceſſary the power of calling them to mind when occaſion requires. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this faculty, the ſenſations depoſited in the memory would be uſeleſs; without it, the mind could compare its preſent ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only, all its judgments would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the ſenſes, and Man no longer act as Man, but as the moſt ſtupid of beaſts. Beſides, the number of the ſenſes and their good organization, <hi>penetration likewiſe requires the ſame elaſticity and force in the fibres as recollection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But even this will not ſuffice. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the relations of things, the mind muſt compare them in their different aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and variouſly combine them.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0658602402:250"/>ardent deſire of attaining perfection; yet ſo long as Man continues unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine his ſenſations, it will be impoſſible for him to acquire knowledge. <hi>Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore requires the ſame organic elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the fibres as reflection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every man has a certain number of ſenſations, but all men have not equally the power of recalling, comparing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining, and arranging them; qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary to the diſcovery of concealed relations. Theſe qualities idiots have not; and this inability to recollect or reflect, is to be wholly attributed to the ſtate of their organs.</p>
                     <p>If we compare the body of an idiot with the body of a rational perſon, we ſhall find many conſiderable diverſities between them. The moſt conſpicuous is the ſmall dimenſions of the <hi>cerebrum. Microcephali</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Book III. Obſ. 15, 16.</note> are idiots by nature; they have neither conception nor judgment: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>macrocephali</hi> are very ingenious.</p>
                     <p>Another difference is the bulk of the body, in compariſon of the ſize of the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0658602402:251"/>head. Extremely large and fat perſons, are commonly but a ſmall remove from ſtupidity; whilſt ſmall and lean perſons are generally the reverſe.</p>
                     <p>But all idiots are not ſo by nature; ſome gradually arrive at that ſtate, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious equally with others. Acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of long continuance<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book III. Obſ. 12.</note>, and likewiſe chronic diſeaſes, impair the penetration. The conſiderable loſs of nervous fluid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by coition, by its diſcharge from the tumor of the <hi>hernia ſpinalis,</hi> or by exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive exerciſe, produces the ſame effects. Great drinkers, apoplectics, they who have undergone the operation of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, they who have been recovered after hanging, remain very long without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and without judgment.</p>
                     <p>Let us attend to the reaſon of theſe phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Microcephali</hi> are idiots, <hi>macrocephali</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſagacious. But if penetration be ever proportionate to the dimenſions of the brain, it is not from any particular orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of this <hi>viſcus,</hi> as ſome have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0658602402:252"/>The brain is only an organ of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and is without relation to the ſoul, except by its ſecreting a greater or leſs quantity of the nervous fluid; and as its volume might more or leſs obſtruct the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the nerves, by compreſſing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes which ſurround it; it is only in theſe reſpects, that the brain can influence penetration.</p>
                     <p>It has been already ſhewn, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of regular thought, ſuch as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to penetration, requires a tenſion of the fibres, particularly of thoſe of the <hi>meninges.</hi> This tenſion, this augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the organic elaſticity of the ſolids, ariſes from the immediate influx of the nervous fluid impelled into theſe organs by the will. The more this fluid, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubject to the ſoul in voluntary motion<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book I. Art. Of the different motions of the body.</note>, abounds, the more ſtrongly Man can apply his mind to reflection, and the longer continue it: for the power of the will on our organs, never prevails ſo far as to render them rigid. Hence it is
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0658602402:253"/>evident, that <hi>microcephali,</hi> who are not abundantly ſupplied therewith, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be ſtupid; and that <hi>macrocephali,</hi> who poſſeſs it in great abundance, muſt be perfectly the reverſe. Hence it is, that large and very fat perſons have in general but little ſagacity; for the bulk of the body continually increaſes, and the ſize of the brain continues the ſame. This enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous bulk of body, compared to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion of the brain, places them in the ſame claſs with <hi>microcephali.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This inability in <hi>microcephali,</hi> and in thoſe who are extremely fat, to increaſe the organic elaſticity of their fibres, often deſtroys the penetration of the moſt ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. To this is owing that ſtupidity which affects thoſe who have been reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered after hanging, apoplectics, thoſe who have ſuffered the operation of the trepan, and hard drinkers. It is this, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which, after acute and chronic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, deprives men of the faculty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and reduces them to a ſtate of infancy.</p>
                     <p>Hence is the reaſon that, when an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fever has conſumed the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0658602402:254"/>fluid, and fatigued our organs by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and precipitate motions, the mind is affected with a ſtupor, all its faculties are diſordered, and all knowledge loſt: this returns not, but in proportion as the body acquires ſtrength, and arrives not to its former perfect ſtate, till the body has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely recovered its former vigour.</p>
                     <p>Hence the reaſon why the violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, profound ſadneſs, and narcotics, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a kind of momentary ſtupidity.</p>
                     <p>Hence the reaſon why ſome perſons have become ſtupid, by imitating too affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly the geſtures of folly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is therefore evident, that the extreme impair of the organic elaſticity of the fibres generates ſtupidity, and that the penetration of every individual depends on his orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization.</hi>

This increaſes and decays by inſenſible degrees; the other has no progreſſion, but has its exiſtence confined, as it were, to an indiviſible point.</p>
                     <p>Sagacity conſiſts in readily diſcovering remote relations. Thus, beſides the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and order of our ſenſations and ideas neceſſary to diſcover thoſe relations, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires quick apprehenſion; hence, not only the ſame phyſical diſpoſition is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as in penetration, that is, force and organic elaſticity of the fibres, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the moſt perfect degree of this elaſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or which is the ſame thing, that degree which is beſt adapted to ſecond the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the will: for the exerciſe of the underſtanding in penetration is voluntary. The regular exerciſe of thought, requires a certain organic tone of the fibres; but this tone is not limited to one particular point, it has a certain extent contained
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0658602402:256"/>between the oppoſite extremes of relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rigidity. Madneſs and ſtupidity are produced by the extremes, wiſdom holds the middle ſtation, and its various degrees occupy the whole interval between them: there are therefore different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in this intermediate ſpace, in every one of which the ſoul may poſſeſs pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. It is in that degree of elaſticity, where the fibres have a greater aptitude to yield obedience to the will, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſagacity conſiſts. Thus <hi>the abundance of nervous fluid</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This is true even with reſpect to the inſtinct of animals, where nature ſeems to prompt every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for although they have particular inclinations, although one may be more or leſs ſavage, more or leſs cruel than another, we ſhall nevertheleſs find them to be all ſtupid, in proportion as they are in want of this fluid; and that the ſagacity of every one is according to the dimenſions of the brain.</note>, <hi>the primitive elaſticity of the fibres, and that degree where the equilibrium between theſe two powers is moſt perfect, muſt be the principle of ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, of invention, of that divine enthuſiaſm which animates genius, and diſtinguiſhes thoſe who poſſeſs it from the herd of common wits.</hi>
                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0658602402:257"/>Sagacity therefore falls to the lot of thoſe who are endued both with vigour and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. Theſe are the qualities which alone actuate thoſe towering minds which ſoar to the firſt principles of ſcience, and rapidly ruſh to the goal; whilſt others lag far behind, and advance with ſlow and tardy ſteps.</p>
                     <p>In proportion as this <hi>equilibrium</hi> between theſe two powers is deſtroyed, the mind neceſſarily loſes its ſagacity; but in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner; if the balance be in favour of the ſolids, if the fibres be either too lax or too rigid, the mind is leſs apt to recall the ſenſations and ideas depoſited in the memory, or to compare them, and leſs readily diſcovers their remote relations. The mind is therefore leſs active, takes up longer time in its reflection, and is ſlower in tracing any analogy, or inveſtigating any truth. Man, thus organized, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs judgment, but not wit. The farther he is from this perfect degree of organic elaſticity, the more his activity of mind is diminiſhed; he may even be at ſuch a diſtance from it, as to poſſeſs no powers of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all. In this ſtate he can pronounce
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0658602402:258"/>on the relations of thoſe objects only which immediately act on the ſenſes; and principles, to ſuch a perſon, are without conſequences. Hence the reaſon why ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of wit, happy flights of any kind, never occur to us when the mind is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued.</p>
                     <p>But when this <hi>equilibrium</hi> between the fibres and nervous fluid, which forms Man's diſpoſition to ſagacity, is deſtroyed, and the ſcale inclines to the latter, vivacity of mind becomes volatility. The ſoul being then ſtrongly affected by the moſt minute<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book I. Art. Of the organs of ſenſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, relatively to their different degrees of ſenſibility.</note> objects, re-acts<note n="†" place="bottom">See Book IV. Art. Why the character of the ſoul is ever congruous to the ſtate of the body.</note> on the body with a force proportionate thereto, communicates to this fluid a very ſtrong impulſe which, acting upon weak fibres, renders them rigid, and deſtroys ſagacity, together with the free exerciſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                     <p>To this ſenſibility add the delicacy, which is inſeparable from it, and which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us incapable of ſuſtaining for any long
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0658602402:259"/>time that laborious attention, which is often neceſſary to the diſcovery of remote relations. Thus too haſty in pronouncing on the relations of things, the mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways falls ſhort of the end which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to attain, forms forced reaſonings, and continues for ever ignorant.</p>
                     <p>The ideas, to be juſt, muſt be diſtinct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe qualities are not inſeparable. Thus in every caſe where juſtneſs of our ideas requires them to be numerous, the mind, if united to a body of very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate texture and extreme ſenſibility, can ſcarce conceive any thing diſtinctly. In a man ſo circumſtanced, the mind has not time to examine throughly any of the objects as they offer: they ſhift ſo faſt, that he has hardly time to perceive them.</p>
                     <p>Hence the mind can have only imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect notions of things, and all its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is but a confuſed huddle of errors and abſurdities.</p>

                     <p>The ſoul united to weak, elaſtic and delicate organs, being continually acted upon by ſtrong ſenſations and ſentiments, diſplays them the moment it is affected by them<note n="*" place="bottom">See Book IV.

Endued with too great ſenſibility to diſſemble, he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe too much ſo to reflect, to ſecure his purpoſes, to comply with, and bend to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, or patiently purſue a ſcheme, till he finds ſome clue, which may ſerve to guide him. Hence he is incapable of that circumſpection, which conceals hidden reſources, till it ſees a fit occaſion to make uſe of them; he knows not what to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, but tells the whole of what he knows, and thus betrays his own ſecrets. Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in diſcourſe, he is ſo likewiſe in his deſigns and actions; his ardor ever carries him to lengths little ſuited to his ſtrength, and by the improper uſe he makes of it, almoſt all his efforts prove ineffectual; in

                        <hi>Prudence therefore depends on that ſtate of the machine, on that tone of the fibres which promotes the free exerciſe of thinking, by moderating the vivacity of the ſenſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</hi> Only the Man, whoſe organs are thus formed, can be ſevere, yet gentle, tender, though not weak, and high-ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without being a <hi>bravado;</hi> he alone can conceal his deſigns under the veil of ſilence, and be at once communicative and diſcreet.

                     <head>Why <hi>MAN</hi> appears to loſe ſome of his mental Faculties without loſing the others.</head>
                     <p>Some men loſe the power of meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet retain their other faculties. Some loſe remembrance, imagination, the power of reflection, yet retain that of recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgment: ſome forget one kind

                     <p>The moſt celebrated philoſophers, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for theſe phenomena, have imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſyſtem, plauſible at firſt ſight, but in reality exceedingly abſurd. They have firſt ſuppoſed, contrary to truth, that each faculty of the ſoul has ſome particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan for its ſeat, entirely disjoined from, and without relation to the others. They have afterwards laid it down as a maxim, that, when one of theſe organs is vitiated, the faculty reſident therein is depraved likewiſe. Finally, to make this ſyſtem quadrate with facts, they have concluded, that in the general diſarrangement of the machine, every part of which is intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected, theſe different organs, ſeats of the different faculties<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Phyſiology of Le Cat, tome I. page 221. Paris edition.</note> are not all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>To elucidate theſe phenomena, I ſhall not undertake a myſterious explanation,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0658602402:263"/>which ſuppoſes us to be endowed with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have not; nor imitate the explanations of others, which are equally repugnant to reaſon and experience. All theſe phenomena, which appear ſo whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, and ſo impoſſible to account for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſyſtem of theſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, are ſo very ſimple, according to that which is here eſtabliſhed, that the only thing to be wondered at is their ſimplicity. We have ſeen that reaſon, imagination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, recollection, penetration, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, &amp;c. are powers of the mind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the different tones of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic elaſticity of the fibres. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident, that theſe effects muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear with their cauſes. I ſhall attempt farther to develope this principle, and give it the cleareſt evidence of truth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe faculties of the ſoul, viz. ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, will, memory, and underſtanding, have different functions, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved; but theſe faculties unite and combine in many different manners: from theſe their combinations reſult thought, and the different operations of the mind. But unleſs they act conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0658602402:264"/>Man has neither ſentiments nor ideas; their ſeparation deſtroys every operation of the mind, and, in appearance, annihilates the faculties themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Although theſe different faculties mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally combine, they however combine not all in the ſame act: according as their combination varies, ſo much the more different are their reſults. Beſides, though our intellectual faculties are the ſole prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the operations of the ſoul, and although ſome are active of themſelves, their exerciſe is nevertheleſs entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the body. The mind cannot proceed alone: it ever requires a certain degree of organic elaſticity in the fibres, to think, reflect, meditate, &amp;c. From theſe different degrees of the organic elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the fibres, reſults every diverſity in the operations of the mind.</p>
                     <p>Regular thought ever requires a tenſion of the fibres: but to think on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubjects, there is required a much greater degree of organic elaſticity in the fibres, than to think on ſome others; as on metaphyſical ſubjects, than on thoſe of elementary geometry; there is likewiſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0658602402:265"/>required a much greater degree of organic elaſticity to meditate than to reflect, to imagine ſomething new, than to judge of ſimple facts. Thus with one degree of organic elaſticity Man can reflect, with another meditate; ſo with one he can imagine, and with another weaker degree, which leaves him unable to recall the ideas and ſenſations formerly depoſited in the memory, he can pronounce on his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſations only, and ſeems to have loſt every faculty but inſtinct: with a degree, yet weaker than this, he is unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine two ſingle ſenſations, and is deſtitute of every ſentiment, even that of his own exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Thus Man may loſe the power of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and retain that of reflection; he may loſe imagination, ſagacity, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and retain good ſenſe; laſtly, he may loſe judgment, and yet retain inſtinct.</p>
                     <p>Both remembrance and recollection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the organic elaſticity of the fibres; but not in an equal degree. Recollection requires the greater degree of tenſion of the two, as any one may be convinced by the efforts which a mind, exhauſted by
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0658602402:266"/>ſtudy, or during the ſtate of convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or drowſineſs, vainly makes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the moſt familiar ideas, ſuch as when called to mind by being mentioned by others, it remembers to have before receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is very natural; for it requires more attention to fix on an abſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than on one which is preſent; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call an analogy without the aid of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as in remembrance by the aſſiſtance of objects, than to diſcover its identity: Man therefore may loſe recollection and yet retain remembrance.</p>
                     <p>Finally, a greater degree of organic e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticity is required to recall extraordinary ideas, than to recollect thoſe which are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; and abſtract ideas than ſimple: ſo likewiſe Man may forget one particular ſort of ideas, and yet retain another. Thus the different degrees of organic elaſticity of the fibres produce new combinations, which interrupt the ſucceſſion of our thoughts, diſorder the chain of our ideas, and ſeem even to annihilate ſome of ous mental faculties, while they leave us the free exerciſe of others. This is the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and manifeſt cauſe of theſe ſingular phenomena.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0658602402:267"/>The different degrees of organic elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity required in the different operations of the mind, may be determined by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the courſe of the fluids, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pulſations, their different degrees of force and vivacity, in one man during meditation, in another during reflection, and in another during revery; and by comparing the courſe of the fluids, the number of pulſations, their different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of force and vivacity in the ſame man in all theſe different ſtates.</p>
                     <p>Thus having ſhewn the principles of theſe phenomena in the different tones of the fibres, having diſcovered the truth of theſe laws in Nature, we may eaſily proceed to eſtimate their effects: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this ſubject may be extremely complicated, and may appear to have but little connection with mathematics, it is poſſible to determine their relations, and to ſubject them to a preciſe evaluation; the balance has been already pointed out, it now remains only to take the amount.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From what has preceded, it is certain that the propenſities, the affections and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the ſoul, folly, wiſdom, ſtupidity,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0658602402:268"/>prudence, reaſon, imagination, recollection, remembrance, penetration, delicacy, ſublimity, depth, ſagacity and genius, are not qualities inherent in the mind, but modes of the ſoul's exiſtence, depending on the ſtate of the organs of the body;</hi> as for inſtance, colours, ſounds, heat, cold, &amp;c. are not eſſential attributes of matter, but qualities dependent on its texture, and on the motion of its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent corpuſcles. It is therefore evident, that organization alone cauſes almoſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Let it be once more noticed, that I pretend not to ſubject the <hi>whole</hi> to phyſical laws; I am well aſſured, that the ſoul <hi>partly</hi> receives its character from moral cauſes.</note> every difference which is obſerved between ſouls; that they receive their principal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics from the corporeal organs; and that, ſuppoſing them really in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture different from each other, this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference would be of no effect, ſo long as they continue united to the body.</p>
                     <p>Thus every thing in Nature is influenced by phyſical laws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Corporeal ſenſibility, the regular or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered courſe of our fluids, primitive or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0658602402:269"/>elaſticity, the rigidity or relaxation of the fibres, the force or volume of the organs, are the cauſes of the ſurpriſing diverſities in ſouls, and the ſecret principles of that great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſoul on the body, and of the body on the ſoul, hitherto deemed an impenetrable myſtery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such are the ſecret cauſes of that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular harmony, which philoſophers have obſerved between the two ſubſtances which form our being, but were unable to explain.</p>
                     <p>Such, in a word, are the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſolid baſis of a ſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every thing appeared arbitrary, obſcure and myſterious.</p>
                     <p>I would here conclude my work, were philoſophers only to be my readers: to ſuch it might be ſufficient to explain the principles on which I ground my doctrine, and I might have ſpared myſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of entering into theſe particulars which are neceſſary to elucidate them. But this were loſt labour: ſince, for one reader who can develop the whole of a ſyſtem by the mere outlines, there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand who muſt ſee the whole chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0658602402:270"/>in order to comprehend the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which it is eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>To theſe it is neceſſary to enter into a minute diſcuſſion: it is not enough that they have given them a clue to guide them to the truth, and have the path pointed out to them; they muſt be, as it were, led by the hand through all the mazes of the labyrinth; otherwiſe they muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be bewildered in it.</p>
