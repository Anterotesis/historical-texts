            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>LETTER I. Containing a <hi>DESCRIPTION</hi> of the North Shores of the Counties of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Devon,</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Somerſetſhire, Wiltſhire, Dorſetſhire, Glouceſterſhire, Buckinghamſhire,</hi> and <hi>Berkſhire.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NOW turned about to the Eaſt; and as, when I went Weſt, I kept to the Southern Coaſt of this long County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> alſo, ſo in going Eaſt, I ſhall keep the North Shore. The firſt Place of any Note, we came to, was <hi>St. Ive</hi>'s, a pretty good Town, and grown rich by the Fiſhing Trade; it is ſituated on the Weſt-ſide of a deep Bay, called <hi>St. Ives-bay,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0141100402:3"/>
from the Town. This Bay is oppoſite, on the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to <hi>Mount</hi>'s-<hi>bay,</hi> which I ſpoke of in my laſt; but it is filled up with Sands, and here is but very little Trade in any thing elſe but <hi>Corniſh</hi> Slate.</p>
            <p>It is a very pleaſant View we have at <hi>Madern-hills,</hi> and the Plain by them, in the Way from the <hi>Land's-end</hi> to <hi>St. Ives</hi>; where we have a Proſpect of the Ocean at the <hi>Land's-end,</hi> Weſt; of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Chanel at <hi>Mount's-bay,</hi> South; and the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Chanel, or <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, North. At <hi>St. Ives</hi> the Land between the Two Bays, being not above Four or Five Miles over, is ſo ſituated, that upon the Hill neither of the Two Seas are above Three Miles off, and very plain to be ſeen; and ſo likewiſe, in a clear Day, are the Iſlands of <hi>Scilly,</hi> tho' above 30 Miles off.</p>
            <p>The Country from hence to <hi>Padſtow</hi> is both fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant, and ſeveral Houſes of Gentlemen are ſeen as we paſs; the Sands alſo are very agreeable to the Eye, and to travel upon: among the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Houſes is <hi>Lanhidrock,</hi> the Seat of the Earls of <hi>Radnor,</hi> who are Barons of <hi>Truro,</hi> and were ſo, long before they obtained the Title of <hi>Radnor</hi>; alſo a good Houſe belonging to the antient Family of <hi>Trefuſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hills are fruitful of Tin, Copper and Lead, all the Way on our Right-hand; the Product of which is carried all to the other Shore; ſo that we ſhall have little to ſay of it here. The chief Buſineſs on this Shore is the Herring Fiſhing; the Herrings about <hi>October</hi> come driving up the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, and from the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in prodigious Shoals, and beat all upon this Coaſt as high as <hi>Bidiford</hi> and <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and are caught in great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities by the Fiſhermen, chiefly on Account of the Merchants of <hi>Falmouth, Foy, Plymouth,</hi> and other Ports on the South.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0141100402:4"/>
               <hi>St. Michael's,</hi> or <hi>Modiſhole,</hi> a mean Portreeve Borough, is not now remarkable, but was of great Note in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Time, and has ſtill a Market weekly, and a yearly Fair.</p>
            <p>We then came to <hi>St. Columb's,</hi> a little Market-town, a Lordſhip belonging to the <hi>Arundels</hi> of <hi>Wardour</hi>; ſo called, to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Arundels</hi> of <hi>Trerice</hi> in this County; which Family, eſpouſing the King's Side in the Civil Wars, ſuffered much, and was innobled in <hi>Charles</hi> II.'s Time. The <hi>Wardour</hi> Family was likewiſe loyal, and ſuffered in the ſame Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Near this Place is a Hill, which has a Rampire on the Summit of it, and a Cauſeway leading to it. 'Tis an old <hi>Daniſh</hi> Camp, and called <hi>Caſtellum Danis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Padſtow</hi> is a large Town, and ſtands on a very good Harbour for ſuch Shipping as uſe the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Trade. The Harbour is the Mouth of the River <hi>Camel,</hi> or <hi>Camal,</hi> which riſing at <hi>Camelford,</hi> runs down by <hi>Bodmyn</hi> to <hi>Wadbridge,</hi> a little Town, where a large Stone Bridge of about Eight Arches is built by the Contributions of the Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at the Motion, and under the Direction, of one <hi>Nicolas Lovibond,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Wadbridge,</hi> the Paſſage over the River before being very dangerous, and having occaſioned the Loſs of ſome Lives, as well as Goods.</p>
            <p>The Paſſage from this Town of <hi>Padſtow</hi> to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is ſaid, by Writers, to be no more than Twenty-four Hours; but this, if ever done, hat been ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that it ought not to be mentioned as generally the Caſe; for I believe not one in Twenty-four Ships makes its Voyage in ſo few Hours; and that they are oftener Five or Six Days in the Paſſage. Here is a very antient Seat, like a Caſtle, of a Family of the Name of <hi>Prideaux,</hi> the Chief of which, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, built this noble Seat there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0141100402:5"/>Higher within the Land lies the Market and Borough Town of <hi>Bodmyn,</hi> formerly one of the Coining Towns of Tin, till it loſt that Privilege to <hi>Leſtwithyel:</hi> However it ſtill injoys ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſome of which are Tokens of its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. It is pretty large, and ſtands between two Hills in a good Air. It had antiently ſeveral Churches, of which now only one remains, which belonged to the Priory, and is at preſent the Pariſh Church. A kind of Carnival is kept here yearly, in <hi>July,</hi> whither great Numbers of People reſort.</p>
            <p>The Coinage Towns were, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, Four; namely,

            <p>
               <hi>Camelford</hi> is a mean, but antient Borough-town. Here the River <hi>Camel</hi> riſes, which takes its Name from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Cam, i. e.</hi> crooked. It has not either Church or Chapel in it, nor ever had. It is only remarkable for two great Battles which were fought here, one between King <hi>Arthur</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Mordred,</hi> and the other between the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Borough of <hi>Boſſiney,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Trevena,</hi> is but a ſmall Village. It is famous only for the ſplendid Ruins of an impregnable Caſtle, built on the Rock, which ſtood partly on the Continent, and partly on an Iſland, joined together by a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. The Caſtle was the Seat of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes, and ſince, of the Dukes of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> And, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Arthur</hi> was born here, and died in one of the above-mentioned Battles near <hi>Camelford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Launceſton,</hi> which is a Corruption of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Lanſtuphadon,</hi> i. e. <hi>St. Stephen</hi>'s Church; is a Market and Borough-town, pretty neat, and is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0141100402:6"/>
ſituate on a riſing Ground, at the Extremity of the County, on the Borders of <hi>Devonſhire:</hi> great Part of it is very old, ragged and decayed.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this County, this was a Frontier Town, well walled about, and fortified, and had alſo a noble Caſtle, which, from its Strength, was called <hi>Caſtle Terrible.</hi> The Inhabitants, for the Defence and Repair of it, held formerly the Lands here by <hi>Caſtle-guard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi>'s good Fortune failed him, and he was forced by <hi>Fairfax</hi> to diſband his Army.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence is <hi>Hengeſton-hill,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a great Plenty of <hi>Corniſh</hi> Diamonds. The <hi>Corniſh Britons</hi> joined the <hi>Danes</hi> here, to drive out the <hi>Saxons</hi> from <hi>Devonſhire</hi>; but were totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by <hi>Egbert</hi> in 831, which, 'tis conjectured, gives the Name of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> to this Hill, in Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of their firſt Leader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newport</hi> is a little Village adjoining, and was formerly Part of <hi>Launceſton</hi>; and yet ſends Two Members to Parliament. And indeed there are no leſs than Forty-four, and the Number of Electors are ſo few in many of the Places, that an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, of which Side ſoever it be, as to Party, has uſually a great Reliance on the Elections in this County every new Parliament, in order to obtain a Majority in the Houſe of Commons: For Forty-four Members from hence, and Forty-five from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Part of the Iſland, who generally go one way, make no ſmall Figure in a Queſtion: And in this Caſe it may not be improperly obſerved, that the two Extremities of the Iſland, let the other Parts go as they will, are generally united in the ſame way of Thinking, or at leaſt of Acting, in all Political Debates, and are likely to be ſo in all Times to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0141100402:7"/>There is a fine Image or Figure of <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> upon the Tower of the Church at <hi>Launceſton,</hi> to which the Papiſts fail not to pay Reverence, as they paſs by. There is no Tin, Copper or Lead found hereabouts, as I could hear, nor any Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture in the Place. There are a pretty many Attorneys here, who manage Buſineſs for the reſt of their Fraternity at the Aſſizes: As to Trade, it has not much to boaſt of, and yet there are People enough in it to excuſe thoſe who call it a populous Place. There is a long Nook of the County runs North from this Place, called the <hi>Hundred of</hi> Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in which there is one Market-town, named <hi>Stratton</hi>; but it has nothing in or about it worth remarking, except only <hi>Stow-houſe,</hi> built by the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and as to its Finiſhings within, not inferior to any in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Carvings, eſpecially thoſe of the Chapel; the grand Alcove, and ſome of the beſt Rooms, were done by the Hand of <hi>Michael Chuke,</hi> and are not excelled by <hi>Gibbon</hi> himſelf. The Landſchape, and Sea-pieces, of which there were a great Number, (particularly in the great Stairs, a Proſpect of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> containing 22 Feet by 12) were the Work of <hi>Vandeiſt.</hi> The Situation of this ſtately Palace renders it a diſagreeable Habitation; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Owners have diſpoſed of the Materials, and it is now (<hi>Nov.</hi> 1739) pulling to Pieces. Near this Town, Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> defeated the Parliament Forces under the Command of Major-General <hi>Chud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and took him Priſoner; for which he was made Baron <hi>Stratton.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, the Place where this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was fought, produced a prodigious Crop of Barley of 10 or 12 Ears on a Stalk, the next Year.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Bodmyn,</hi> is to be ſeen the Set of monumental Stones, called <hi>The Hurlers</hi>; which Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> ſays, are, out of Doubt, Remains of an antient <hi>Druid</hi> Temple. Probably they are called by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0141100402:8"/>
this Name, from the Game of Hurling, practiſed in theſe Parts; the Country People giving them that for want of a better; and indeed, it is ſaid, that they have a ſuperſtitious Notion, that they were once Men, who were transformed into Stones, for playing at this Sport on a <hi>Sunday.</hi> They are oblong, rude, unhewn Stones, pitched on one End upon the Ground. They ſtand on a Down in Three Circles, the Centres whereof are in a right Line, the middle-moſt Circle the greateſt.</p>
            <p>Now I have mentioned the <hi>Hurlers,</hi> I muſt take the Opportunity to deſcribe the <hi>Hurling Match</hi>; for which the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Men are ſo particularly famous, and which is one of their principal Recreations, tho' bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous enough. A Silver Ball is generally the Prize on theſe Occaſions. The Match is made in different Manners: for ſometimes the Challenge is by Twenty or Thirty Men on a Side, and no others are to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere; at other times, when a great Number of People are aſſembled at a <hi>Wake</hi> or <hi>Church-Ale,</hi> the Word is given out, <hi>That</hi> Johns, Wills, <hi>and</hi> Toms, <hi>will oppoſe all other Names:</hi> or, at other times, <hi>That</hi> Eldeſt <hi>or</hi> Seconds <hi>are againſt all</hi> Younger Sons. And ſo the Ball is thrown up, and becomes the Property of that Party which carries it away to the Goal ſet for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But another kind of <hi>Hurling</hi> is, when an <hi>Out-ball,</hi> as they call it, is thrown up; and theſe Matches are generally made by Two or more neighbouring Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, at a Day agreed on, bring each of them the Men of Two, Three, or more Pariſhes; and the Goals are then ſet, perhaps, Four or Five Miles diſtant, at ſome Gentlemens Houſes, Towns, or the like: and here nothing is ſaid about Matching in Number, or otherwiſe; but the Ball is thrown up, and a bloody Skirmiſh generally enſues: no Buſhes, Briers, Bogs, Mud-pools, Rivers, or any other Impediments, hinder their Courſe, nor any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0141100402:9"/>
Friendſhip, Relation, or former Obligation, in the leaſt, abates their Fury. The Party prevailing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally preſent the Ball to the Gentlemen who brought them on, as a Trophy; and he, in Return, ſets open his Cellar-doors, where they waſh away the Blood from their Noſes, and apply a Balſam to their Bruiſes.</p>
            <p>The Wreſtling in <hi>Cornwall</hi> is, indeed, a much more manly and generous Exerciſe; and that Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which they call the <hi>Corniſh Hug,</hi> has made them eminent in the Wreſtling Rings all over <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; as the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Men are, for their Dexterity at the Hand and Foot, and throwing up the Heels of their Adverſary, without taking hold of him.</p>
            <p>Paſſing the River <hi>Tamar,</hi> about Two Miles from <hi>Launceſton,</hi> we enter the great County of <hi>Devon</hi>; and as it is in the moſt wild and barren Part of it, and where formerly Tin Mines were found, tho' now they are either quite exhauſted, or not to be worked without more Charge than Profit; ſo we muſt expect it a little to reſemble its neighbour County.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Tamar</hi> here abounds with freſh Salmon, which are ſo exceeding fat and good, that they are eſteemed in both Counties above the Fiſh of the ſame Kind found in other Places; and the Quantity is ſo great, as ſupplies the Country in abundance. This is occaſioned by the Mouth of the River being ſo very large, and the Water ſo deep for Two Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it opens into <hi>Plymouth Sound,</hi> that the Fiſh have a ſecure Retreat in the ſalt Water for their Harbour and Shelter, and from thence they ſhoot up into the freſh Water, in vaſt Numbers, to caſt their Spawn.</p>
            <p>We ride but a few Miles in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> before we find a different Face in ſeveral reſpects: As, 1. More People than in <hi>Cornwall:</hi> 2. Larger Towns: 3. The People all buſy, and in full Imploy upon their Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0141100402:10"/>At the uppermoſt and extreme Part of the County North-weſt, runs a large Promontory into the Sea beyond all the Land on either Side, whether of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> or of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> This they would fain have called <hi>Hercules</hi>'s <hi>Promontory</hi>; but the honeſt Sailors, and, after them, the plain Country People, call it <hi>Hartland Point,</hi> or <hi>Hearty Point,</hi> from the Town of <hi>Hartland,</hi> which ſtands juſt within the Shore, and is ſituated on the utmoſt Edge of the County of <hi>Devon:</hi> It is a Market-town of good Reſort, the People coming conſtantly to it out of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the Fiſher-boats of <hi>Barnſtable, Bidiford,</hi> and the other Towns on the Coaſts, lying often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Lee,</hi> as they call it, of theſe Rocks, for Shelter from the South-weſt, or South-eaſt Winds; at which time the Seamen go on Shore here, and ſupply themſelves with Proviſions: nor is the Town unconcerned in that gainful Fiſhing-trade, which is carried on for the Herrings on this Coaſt.</p>
            <p>From this Point or Promontory, the Land falling away for ſome Miles, makes a Gulph or Bay, which reaching to the Head-land, or Point of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> Haven, is called from thence <hi>Barnſtable</hi> Bay. Into this Bay, or at the Weſt-end of it, the Rivers <hi>Taw</hi> and <hi>Towridge</hi> empty themſelves at one Mouth; and it is very particular, that as Two Rivers join in One Chanel, ſo here are Two great trading Towns in One Port, a thing, which, as it is not uſual, ſo I cannot ſay is an Advantage to any of them; for it naturally follows, that they rival one another, and leſſen both; whereas, had they been joined together in one Town, or were it poſſible to join them, they would make the moſt conſiderable Town, or City rather, in all this Part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Towns of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> and <hi>Bidiford,</hi> the firſt, the moſt antient; the laſt, the moſt flouriſhing; the Harbour or River is, in its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, the ſame to both; and when they part,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0141100402:11"/>
the <hi>Towridge</hi> turns to the Right, or South-weſt, and the <hi>Taw</hi> to the South-eaſt; yet they ſeem to be both ſo ſafe, ſo eaſy in the Chanel, ſo equally good with reſpect to Shipping, and ſo equidiſtant from the Sea, that neither Town complains of the Bounty of the Sea to them, or their Situation by Land; and yet of late Years the Town of <hi>Bidiford</hi> has flouriſhed, and the Town of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> rather declined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bidiford</hi> is a clean, well-built Town; the more antient Street, which lies next the River, is very pleaſant, where is the Bridge, a very noble Quay, and the Cuſtom-houſe; it is alſo very well built and populous, and fronts the River for above three Quarters of a Mile: But beſides this, there is a new ſpacious Street, which runs North and South, or rather North-weſt, and South-eaſt, a great Length, broad as the <hi>High-Street</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> well-built, and inhabited with conſiderable and wealthy Merchants, who traffick to moſt Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Here, as is to be ſeen in almoſt all the Market-towns of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> is a very large and well-finiſhed Meeting-houſe, and, by the Multitude of People which I ſaw come out of it, I thought all the Town had gone thither, and began to inquire for the Church: but I found that alſo large, ſpacious, and filled with People of the beſt Faſhion.</p>
            <p>The Trade of this Town, as well as of all the Towns on this Coaſt, being very much in Fiſh, I obſerved that ſeveral Ships were imployed to go to <hi>Liverpool,</hi> and up the River <hi>Merſey</hi> to <hi>Warrington,</hi> to fetch the Rock Salt, which is found in that County, (and of which I ſhall ſay more in my Remarks on thoſe Parts) to <hi>Bidiford</hi> and <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> and there diſſolve it into Brine in the Sea-water, joining the Strength of two Bodies in one, and then boil it up again into a new Salt, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do by that of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> This is juſtly called <hi>Salt upon Salt,</hi> and with this they cure their Herrings.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0141100402:12"/>
As this is a Trade which can be but of few Years ſtanding, becauſe the Rock Salt itſelf has not been diſcovered in <hi>England</hi> many Years; ſo the Difference in curing the Fiſh has been ſuch, that the Demand for them has conſiderably increaſed in foreign Markets.</p>
            <p>Here is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River, built in the 14th Century, on 24 <hi>Gothick</hi> Arches, all uniform and regular, and very good Workmanſhip of the kind. Theſe Arches are indeed beautiful and ſtately; but what a late Author ſays, that one of them is ſo big, that a Ship of 60 Tons may ſail under it, is a Miſtake, no ſuch thing being practicable, either at <hi>London</hi> Bridge, <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Bridge, or even at <hi>York,</hi> where the largeſt Arch in <hi>England</hi> is ſuppoſed to be.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Bidiford</hi> has a fine Bridge over the <hi>Towridge,</hi> ſo <hi>Barnſtable</hi> has a very noble one over the <hi>Taw,</hi> and tho' not longer, is counted larger and ſtronger than the other. Theſe two rival Towns are really very conſiderable; both of them have a large Share in the Trade to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the Herring-fiſhery, and in a Trade to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America</hi>; if <hi>Bidiford</hi> cures more Fiſh, <hi>Barnſtable</hi> imports more Wine, and other Merchandizes; they are both eſtabliſhed Ports for landing Wool from <hi>Ireland</hi>; of which by itſelf.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Bidiford</hi> has a greater Number of Merchants, <hi>Barnſtable</hi> has a greater Commerce within Land, by its great Market for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wool and Yarn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Serge-markets of <hi>Tiverton</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> who come up hither to buy. So that, in a word, <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi> tho' it has loſt Ground to <hi>Bidiford,</hi> yet, take it in all its Trade completely, is full as conſiderable as <hi>Bidiford</hi>; only, that perhaps it was formerly far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to it, and the other has riſen up to be its Match.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barnſtable</hi> is a large, well-built Town, ſeated among the Hills. It is more populous than <hi>Bidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> but not better built, and ſtands lower; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that at High-water in Spring-tides it is, in a manner, ſurrounded with Water. The Bridge was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0141100402:13"/>
built by the generous Benefaction of one <hi>Stamford,</hi> a Citizen and Merchant of <hi>London,</hi> who, it ſeems, was not a Native of the Place; but by trading here to his Gain, had Kindneſs enough for the Town, to confer that valuable Benefit upon them. It was formerly walled in, and had a Caſtle and a Priory. 'Tis governed by a Mayor and Twenty-four Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, whereof Two are Aldermen. It has alſo an High-Steward, and Recorder.</p>
            <p>The Bridge at <hi>Bidiford,</hi> as above, was likewiſe a Gift; but was, as they ſay, done by Collections among the Clergy, by Grant of Indulgences, and the like Church Management: However, both the Towns are infinitely obliged to the Benefactors; and we wiſh no worſe Uſe had ever been made of Superſtition.</p>
            <p>Behind <hi>Bidiford,</hi> as we come from <hi>Launceſton,</hi> are ſeveral good Towns, tho' I obſerved, that the Country was wild and barren; as <hi>Taviſtock, Torrington,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taviſtock</hi> is ſituate on the <hi>Tavy,</hi> among Springs, and is a large Town pretty well built. The Abbot of this Place ſat in Parliament, built a Church of 126 Yards long, ſpacious Cloiſters, and a Chapter-houſe, with 36 Stalls, which are all now deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Torrington</hi> is ſituated on the ſame River that <hi>Bidiford</hi> ſtands upon. It has a large ſpacious Church, with a Library in it; and was for ſome time the Reſidence of <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Henry</hi> VII.</p>
            <p>Another Town in this Part of the Country is <hi>Okehampton,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Okington,</hi> a good Market and Borough-town, governed by Eight principal Burgeſſes, and as many Aſſiſtants: it is a manufacturing Town, as all the Towns this way now are, and pretty rich; but in the Records of Antiquity it appears to have been much more conſiderable than it is now, having 92 Knights Fees belonging to it.</p>
            <p>A little above <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> N. E. upon the Coaſt, ſtands a noted Market and Port-town, called <hi>Ilford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0141100402:14"/>
a Place of good Trade, populous and rich; which is owing to its having a very good Harbour and Road for Ships, which affords a ſafe Shelter for Veſſels from <hi>Ireland,</hi> when in bad Weather they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without the extremeſt Hazard, run into the Mouth of the <hi>Taw,</hi> which they call <hi>Barnſtable</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this is one Reaſon, that the Merchants at <hi>Barnſtable</hi> do much of their Buſineſs at this Port of <hi>Ilfordcomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Harbour of this Town was maintain'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the private Expence of the Anceſtors of Sir <hi>Bourchier Wrey,</hi> Bart. Lord of the Manor; and the Quay or Pier of it contains in Length upwards of 850 Feet, and in Height upwards of Forty; and the Warp-houſe, Light-houſe, Pilot-boats, and Taw-boats belonging to the Port, were at firſt founded and built, and conſtantly repaired and maintained, by that worthy Family, without any Aſſiſtance, but ſome ſmall Acknowledgments paid to them as Lords of the Manor. But by Length of Time, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Sea, the Quay was very much ſunk and impair'd, the Warp and Warp-houſe, by long Uſage, was gone to Decay, and the Boats for Piloting and Towing were much out of Repair, and the ſmall Duties and Acknowlegements to Sir <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier</hi> ſinking, and being frequently unpaid; to remedy all theſe Evils, an Act paſſed <hi>Anno</hi> 1731, <hi>George</hi> II. for repairing, and keeping in Repair, and inlarging the Piers and Harbour, and for the Support of the Light and Light-houſe, the Warp and Warp-houſe, and the Pilot, and Towing-boats, as above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: ſo that by this means the Harbour of <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordcomb</hi> is likely to continue the uſeful and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Port it has been for ſo many Years paſt, to the End of Time.</p>
            <p>Antiquity tells us long Stories of the <hi>Danes</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Coaſt; of <hi>Hubba</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King being ſlain at <hi>Kennith</hi> Caſtle, between this Place and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0141100402:15"/>
Mouth of the <hi>Taw</hi> and <hi>Towridge</hi>; and that the Place was called <hi>Hubbeſtow</hi> from his being buried there: but I could not hear either of this Caſtle, or Burial-place, or ſo much as the Ruins of them.</p>
            <p>The Sea-coaſt in this Country runs a little farther Eaſt by North; but nothing of Moment is to be ſeen there, except Fiſhing-towns, and little Creeks, on which are Two Market-towns, <hi>viz. Combemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Porlock,</hi> till we came to <hi>Minehead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving the Coaſt in our Journey Southward, we came to the great River <hi>Ex</hi> or <hi>Iſca,</hi> which riſes in the Hills on the North Side of the County, and, like the <hi>Tamar,</hi> begins within Four or Five Miles of the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea. The Country it riſes in is called <hi>Exmore: Camden</hi> ſays it is a filthy, barren Ground; and indeed ſo it is: but as ſoon as the <hi>Ex</hi> comes off from the Moors and hilly Country, and deſcends into the lower Grounds, we found an Alteration; for then we ſaw <hi>Devonſhire</hi> in its other Countenance, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, populous and fruitful, and continuing ſo till we came to <hi>Tiverton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to <hi>Exeter,</hi> this is the greateſt manufacture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Town in the County, and, of all the inland Towns, is likewiſe next to it in Wealth, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People; it ſtands on the River <hi>Ex,</hi> and has over it an old Stone Bridge, with another over the little River <hi>Loman,</hi> which immediately after falls into the <hi>Ex</hi> juſt below the Town. Antiquity ſays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Bridges were built, there were two Fords here, one thro' each River; and that the Town was from thence called <hi>Twyfordton,</hi> that is, the Town upon the two Fords; and ſo, by abbreviating the Sounds, <hi>Twy-for-ton,</hi> then <hi>Tiverton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town has been a remarkable Sufferer by Fire; for in the Year 1598. <hi>April</hi> 3. it was conſum'd on a ſudden; <hi>Aug.</hi> 5. 1612, it was again burnt down; and <hi>July</hi> 5. 1731, another dreadful Fire deſtroyed there 200 of the beſt Houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0141100402:16"/>An Act paſſed on this ſad Occaſion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1732, for the more eaſy rebuilding of the Town, and determining Differences on that Account; and it injoins, that the new-built Houſes ſhall be cover'd with Lead, Slate, or Tile, and not Thatch; that perilous Trades ſhall not be exerciſed in publick Streets; that no Stacks of Hay, Straw, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be erected at or near the publick Parts of the Town; that Fire-Engines may be bought by the Guardians of the Poor; that Houſes may be demoliſhed to ſtop any future Fire: that the Streets and Paſſages of the Town may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and particular Houſes pulled down for that Purpoſe, with other uſeful Proviſions.</p>
            <p>An Act alſo paſſed <hi>Anno</hi> 1733, for making a Chapel, built by the Subſcription of the Inhabitants of <hi>Tiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a perpetual Cure; and for providing a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for the Miniſters who ſhall officiate in it; for, as the Preamble to the Act obſerves, the Pariſh Church was not near capacious enough to receive the Inhabitants of the Pariſh. The late Sir <hi>William Wyndham</hi> was a great Encourager and Promoter of this new Chapel at its firſt Erection.</p>
            <p>But the Beauty of <hi>Tiverton</hi> is the Free-School, at the Eaſt Entrance into the Town, a noble Building, but a much nobler Foundation; it was erected by one <hi>Peter Blundel,</hi> a Clothier, and a Lover of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who uſed the Saying of <hi>William of Wickham</hi> to the King, when he founded the Royal School at <hi>Wincheſter, viz.</hi>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That if he was not himſelf a Scholar, he would be the Occaſion of making more Scholars than any Scholar in <hi>England</hi>;"</q> to which End he founded this School.
He has endow'd it ſo liberally, that, I was told, the Schoolmaſter has at leaſt Sixty Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides a very good Houſe to live in, and the Advantage of Scholars not on the Foundation; and that the Uſher has in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. To this the generous Founder added Two Fellowſhips, and Two Scholarſhips, which he gave
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0141100402:17"/>
the Maintenance for to <hi>Sydney</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge</hi>; and One Fellowſhip, and Two Scholarſhips, to <hi>Baliol</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi>; all which are appointed for the Scholars bred up in this School.</p>
            <p>As this is the chief Nurſery of almoſt all the young Gentry of theſe Weſtern Parts, the Profit ariſing to the Maſter from Boarders, and the liberal Benefactions of the Parents, added to the Salary before-mention'd, render it a Preferment ſuitable to a Man of the beſt Parts and Learning; and as the Truſtees are Gentlemen of great Honour, it is generally diſpoſed of to the moſt worthy Candidate. Mr. <hi>Rayner</hi> preſided in it for many Years, with very great Applauſe, and dy'd about <note n="*" place="bottom">This was written <hi>Anno</hi> 1740.</note> Twelve Years ago. To him ſucceeded Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>; after him Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>; next Mr. <hi>Weſley,</hi> once Uſher of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> School, as noted for his poetical Performances, as his Brothers <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> are for their being at the Head of the new Sectariſts, who are called <hi>Methodiſts</hi>; and he dying <hi>Nov.</hi> 1739, is ſucceeded by Mr. <hi>Daddo.</hi> Thus hath it, in Twelve Years time, undergone Five different Regimens; and if it be conſider'd, that every Change introduces ſome Difference in the Method of Teaching and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it will be no Surprize, that the School is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſunk in its former Reputation. The preſent Maſter is Fellow of <hi>Baliol</hi> College, <hi>Oxford,</hi> had his Education here, and from his great Abilities, and good Oeconomy, (in which laſt reſpect a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint lay againſt his Predeceſſor) the School is like to retrieve its former flouriſhing Condition.</p>
            <p>The great Number of Gentlemens Sons ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their Education, as I have hinted, is no ſmall Advantage to the Town likewiſe; and this, join'd with the briſk Trade carried on here, renders it ſo flouriſhing, that notwithſtanding the dreadful Calamity it underwent by the Fire in 1731, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0141100402:18"/>
almoſt totally conſumed it, it is already very elegantly rebuilt; and carries very few other Marks of this Devaſtation, than the Magnificence and Beauty of the new Structures.</p>
            <p>As this is a manufacturing Country, we found the People here all fully imploy'd, and very few, if any, out of Work.</p>
            <p>From this Town there is little belonging to <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> but what has been ſpoken of, except what lies in the Road to <hi>Taunton,</hi> which we took next, where we meet with the River <hi>Columb,</hi> which riſes alſo in the utmoſt Limits of the County towards <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and gives Name to ſo many Towns on its Banks, that it leaves no room to doubt of its own Name being right; ſuch are <hi>Columb-David</hi>'s, <hi>Ufco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumb, Columbſtock,</hi> and <hi>Columbton</hi>; the laſt is a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town, and they are all full of Manufacturers depending much on the Maſter-manufacturers of <hi>Tiverton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we leave <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> it will not be amiſs to take Notice of <hi>Lundy</hi> Iſland, which, tho' 50 Miles from <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> North-weſtward, is much mote remote from any other Continent. 'Tis but Five Miles long, and Two broad; but ſo ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inacceſſible Rocks, that there is but one ſmall Entrance into it, where Two Men can ſcarce go abreaſt. Tho' this Iſland lies ſo far in the Sea, it has the Advantage of ſeveral Springs of freſh Water.</p>
            <p>With the Town of <hi>Tiverton</hi> we leave the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> and entering <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> have really a View of a different Country from <hi>Devonſhire</hi>; for at <hi>Wellington,</hi> the firſt Town we came to in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> tho' partly imployed in Manufacture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, we were immediately ſurrounded with Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, to ſuch a Degree, that we had ſome Difficulty to keep them from under our Horſes Heels. I was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0141100402:19"/>
aſtoniſh'd at ſuch a Sight, in a Country where the People were ſo generally full of Work; for in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> where there are hardly any Manufacturers, and abundance of Poor, we never found any like this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wellington</hi> is a low dirty Place, and is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for having been the Place of Reſidence of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Popham,</hi> in the Reigns of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> I. who was buried here. They talk much of one <hi>Salkeld,</hi> who was converted from Popery by King <hi>James</hi> I. and made Miniſter of this Place. He called himſelf, in Compliment to the King, <hi>The Royal Convert</hi>; who, in return, complimented him with the Title of the <hi>Learned Salkeld,</hi> which, by-the-bye, reflected no bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment on himſelf, for having converted a learned Man.</p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Somerſet</hi> joins to the North-eaſt Part of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and takes its Name from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Gladyr Haf,</hi> which ſignifies Summer-Country, and ſo the <hi>Welſh</hi> call it in their Language to this Day. I touch'd only upon one Point of the County in my laſt, as I went Weſtward. The whole County is worth a more particular Account, than can be given within the Space of a Letter.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Wellington</hi> we came to <hi>Taunton,</hi> leaving <hi>Blackdown Hills</hi> on our Right, and <hi>Ilminſter</hi> behind them Southward, a Market-town, fam'd for its very good Church, and a ſtately Monument erected in it to <hi>Nicolas Wadham,</hi> and <hi>Dorothy,</hi> his Wife, Founders of <hi>Wadham</hi> College, <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near <hi>Taunton</hi> lies that rich Track of Ground, vulgarly called <hi>Taunton-dean.</hi> This large, wealthy, and very populous Town takes its Name from the River <hi>Tone,</hi> whereon it is ſituated. One of the chief Manufacturers here told us, That there was at that time ſo good a Trade in the Town, that they had eleven hundred Looms going for the Weaving of Sagathies, Duroys, and ſuch kind of Stuffs; and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0141100402:20"/>
that not one of thoſe Looms wanted Work: he added, That there was not a Child in the Town, or in the Villages round it, of above Five Years old, but, if it was not neglected by its Parents, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught, could earn its own Bread. This was what I never met with in any Place in <hi>England,</hi> except at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Election of Members here, is by thoſe whom they call Pot-Walloners, that is to ſay, Every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, whether Houſe-keeper or Lodger, who dreſſes his own Victuals: to make out which, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inmates or Lodgers will, ſome little time before the Election, bring out their Pots, and make Fires in the Street, and boil their Victuals in the Sight of their Neighbours, that their Votes may not be called in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>There are Two large Pariſh Churches in this Town, and Two or Three Meeting-houſes, one of which is ſaid to be the largeſt in the County. The Inhabitants have been noted for Diſſenters principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for <hi>Taunton</hi> was always counted a Seminary for ſuch. They ſuffer'd much in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, but paid King <hi>James</hi> home for the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exerciſed by <hi>Jefferies</hi> among them; for when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> arriv'd, the whole Town ran in to him, with ſo univerſal a Joy, that it was thought, if he had wanted it, he might have raiſed a little Army there, and in the adjacent Part of the Country.</p>
            <p>There is a kind of College, or Academy, for the Diſſenters in this Town; and it is by far the greateſt Town in all this Part of the Country.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Taunton</hi> we went North to take a View of the Coaſt. <hi>Exmore,</hi> of which mention was made above, where the River <hi>Ex</hi> riſes, lies in the Way, Part of it in this County, and extending to the Sea Side: it gives, indeed, but a melancholy View, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vaſt Track of barren and deſolate Lands; yet on the Coaſt there are ſome very good Sea-ports.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0141100402:21"/>
               <hi>Porlock,</hi> mentioned before, on the utmoſt Extent of the County, has but a ſmall Harbour, nor has it any thing of Trade.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Minehead,</hi> the ſafeſt Harbour on this Side, is a fine Port: no Ship is ſo big, but it may come in; and no Weather ſo bad, but the Ships are ſafe when they are in; and they told me, that in the great Storm, <hi>Anno</hi> 1703, when the Ships were blown on Shore, wreck'd, and loſt, in every Harbour of the County, they ſuffer'd little or no Damage in this.</p>
            <p>The Trade of this Town lies chiefly with <hi>Ireland,</hi> and this was for many Years the chief Port in theſe Parts, where Wool from <hi>Ireland</hi> was allowed to be imported; but that Liberty is ſince inlarged to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Ports by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Town is well built, is full of rich Merchants, and has ſome Trade alſo to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> They correſpond much with the Merchants of <hi>Barnſtable</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in their foreign Trade. What has greatly contributed to the Improvement of <hi>Minehead,</hi> was an Act paſſed in the 12th and 13th Year of the late King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, which was continued by an Act of the Tenth of the late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> For Recovering, Securing, and keeping in Repair, the Harbour of <hi>Minehead.</hi> And now ſo lately as in the Seſſion 1737-8, another Act paſſed for further continuing the Terms and Powers of the Two former Acts, for the bringing to Effect the ſame laudable Purpoſes, in purſuance of which a new Head has been built, the Beach clear'd, and a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs made in the Piers and deſign'd Works.</p>
            <p>From hence the Coaſt bears back Weſt to <hi>Watchet,</hi> a ſmall Port of late Years, tho' formerly much more conſiderable; for it had given Place to <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> tho' now it is in a much better Condition than it uſed to be in; and this it owes to Two Acts of Parliament, one paſſed in the Sixth Year of the late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> for repairing of its Quay and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0141100402:22"/>
and the other in the Tenth. But when the Works deſigned were near completed, it was found, that the Quay was built much too low, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a ſufficient Length to preſerve the Town, and the Ships and Veſſels riding in the Harbour, from the Violence of the Sea: whereupon another Act paſſed in the Seventh of King <hi>George</hi> I. for continuing the Duties laid by the former Acts, and remedying the Inconveniencies before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that the Town of <hi>Minehead</hi> roſe out of the Decay of the Towns of <hi>Porlock</hi> and <hi>Watchet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this Coaſt are vaſt Quantities of Rock, or rather Pebbles, which the Sea, at low Water, leaves uncovered, from whence the neighbouring Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants fetch them on Shore to a higher Ground, and burn them into Lime for dreſſing their Land; but it is more eſpecially uſeful in Building; for that no Cement whatſoever is more laſting for <hi>Jets d' Eau</hi> Heads, Piers, and other Maſonry that is to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water; in which Poſition it runs up to a Stone as hard as Marble, and is ſcarce to be beaten abroad. The Cliffs are ſtored with Alabaſter, which, by the Waſh of the Sea, falls down, and is convey'd from hence to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and other Places on this Shore, in great Quantity. Neither ſhould it be omitted, that the Inhabitants burn great Quantities of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed to ſupply the Glaſs-makers at <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Walking on the Beach near <hi>Watchet,</hi> I diſcover'd among the large Gravel great Numbers of Stones, fluted in Imitation of the Shells of Fiſhes of all kinds: many of the flat kind are double, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tallied one in another, which may, by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Stroke, be ſeparated. How to account for the vaſt Variety to be found here of this Sport of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I know not: ſome I have ſeen as broad as a Pewter-diſh, and again others no bigger than a Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-corn; but in all of them the Flutings are regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0141100402:23"/>
ſome like the Eſcallop, in Rays from a Centre, others like the Perriwinkle, in ſpiral Lines: in theſe and all other Forms, they lie here in great Plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quantock</hi> is a high Down in the Neighbourhood; from whence, beſides the two little Iſlands, called the <hi>Steep-Holmes,</hi> and the <hi>Flat-Holmes,</hi> and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive View of the Chanel, I had a fair and diſtinct Proſpect of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Coaſt for many Leagues in Length.</p>
            <p>From hence the winding Shore brings us to <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.</hi> This is an antient and very conſiderable Town and Port; it ſtands at the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Parrat,</hi> or <hi>Perrot,</hi> which comes from the South, after having received the River <hi>Tone</hi> from the Weſt, which is made navigable up to within a few Miles of <hi>Taunton,</hi> by a very fine new Chanel, cut at the Expence of the People of <hi>Taunton,</hi> and which, by the Navigation of it, is infinitely advantageous to that Town, and well worth all their Expence, firſt by bringing up Coals, which are brought from <hi>Swanzy</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> by Sea to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and thence by Barges up this River to <hi>Taunton</hi>; next for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all heavy Goods and Merchandizes from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſuch as Iron, Lead, Oil, Wine, Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Grocery, Dye-ſtuffs, and the like.</p>
            <p>This Town of <hi>Bridgwater</hi> is a populous, trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Town, well-built, and as well inhabited, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Families of good Faſhion dwelling in it, beſides Merchants. The famous Admiral <hi>Blake,</hi> who under the Commonwealth ſo much exalted the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> maritime Force, was a Native of this Town.</p>
            <p>This Town was regularly fortified in the late Civil Wars, and ſuſtained more than one Siege. The Situation of it renders it eaſy to be fortified, the River and Haven taking one chief Part of the Circumference. Over the River, they have a very good Bridge of Stone; and the Tide riſes here, at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0141100402:24"/>
High-water, near Six Fathoms, and ſometimes flows in with ſuch Impetuoſity, that it comes Two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep at a time; and when it does ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, it often occaſions great Damage to Ships, driving them foul of one another, and frequently overſets them. This ſudden Rage of the Tide is called the <hi>Boar,</hi> and is frequent in all the Rivers of this Chanel, eſpecially in the <hi>Severn</hi>; 'tis alſo known in the North, particularly in the <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>Ouſe,</hi> at their Entrance into the <hi>Humber,</hi> at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and in ſeveral other Places.</p>
            <p>There is in <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> beſides a very large Church, a fine Meeting-houſe, built ſince the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, in which 'tis remarkable, that they have an advanced Seat for the Mayor and Aldermen, when any of the Magiſtrates ſhall be of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as ſometimes has happened. Here alſo is a College, or private Academy, for the Diſſenters to breed up their preaching Youth.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Bridgwater</hi> is a Road to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which they call the <hi>Lower-way</hi>; the <hi>Upper-way,</hi> which is the more frequented Road, being over <hi>Mendip Hills.</hi> This Lower-way is not always paſſable, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Floods, and dangerous Inundations. All this Part of the Country, <hi>viz.</hi> between <hi>Bridgwater</hi> and the Sea, and on Northward upon the Coaſt, lies low, and is wholly imployed in feeding of Black Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which they bring out of the Weſt Part of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi> and the neighbouring Borders of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where the fineſt are bred; for as to thoſe few bred in theſe low Lands, they are very heavy, ſluggiſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapely, and the Beef ſoft and ſpongy, ſuch as they ſeldom or never drive to <hi>London</hi> Markets. Indeed, they breed a great many Colts; but then they too muſt be tranſplanted very young, into a dry, healthy Soil; for 'tis very difficult to find a Horſe of their own Breed fit for any thing but a Drudge. The Moors, or Marſh-grounds, which are alſo imploy'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0141100402:25"/>
in the ſame way, extend themſelves up the Rivers <hi>Perrot</hi> and <hi>Ivil,</hi> into the Heart of the Country; of which in its Place.</p>
            <p>This low Part, between <hi>Bridgwater</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſuffered exceedingly in that terrible Inundation of the Sea, which was occaſioned by the great Storm, <hi>Anno</hi> 1703; and the Country-people have ſet up Marks upon their Houſes and Trees, with this Note upon them, <hi>Thus high the Waters came in the great Storm: Thus far the great Tide flowed up in the laſt violent Tempeſt</hi>; and the like.</p>
            <p>In one Place they ſhewed us where a Ship was driven up upon the Shore, ſeveral hundred Yards from the ordinary High-water Mark, and left upon dry Land.</p>
            <p>As the low Part is thus imployed in grazing and feeding Cattle, ſo all the reſt of this large extended Country is imployed in the Woollen Manufacture, and in the beſt and moſt profitable Part of it, <hi>viz.</hi>

The above Sketch, however, may ſerve as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to it. But I ſhall add a little more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this County; and upon my entering into the North-weſt and Weſt Parts of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where the Centre of this Prodigy of a Trade is, I ſhall ſum it all up together, and ſhew you the Extent of Land which it ſpreads itſelf upon, and ſo give you ſome Idea, as well of the vaſt Numbers of People who are ſuſtained, as of thoſe who are inriched by it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt firſt go back a little while into <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire:</hi> The Northern Part of the County I did not viſit in this Journey, which, as I hinted before, is only a Return from my long Travel to the <hi>Land's-end.</hi> In omitting this Part, I, of courſe, leave the two Cities of <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Bath,</hi> and that high Part of the County called <hi>Mendip-hill,</hi> to my next Weſtern Journey, which will include all the Counties due Weſt from <hi>London</hi>; for theſe now ſpoken of, tho' ordinarily called the Weſt-country, are rather North-weſt than Weſt.</p>
            <p>In that Part of the Country which lies Southward of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> is <hi>Langport,</hi> a well-frequented Market-town, on the River <hi>Parr,</hi> which is navigable for Barges to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and occaſions a good Trade here. Eels are exceeding plentiful and cheap here. Near this Place General <hi>Fairfax</hi> beat up the diſcontented <hi>Goring</hi>'s Quarters, and intirely defeated him.</p>

               <hi>Ivelcheſter</hi> is a Borough Town, and, as its Ruins ſhew, was formerly very large, and incompaſs'd with a double Wall, and had Four Churches.

               <hi>Somerton</hi> is a good Market-town, whence, ſome ſay, the Country takes its Name. It was antiently very noted, and had a ſtrong Caſtle, in which <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was Priſoner. Here is a Fair which holds from <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> to the Middle of <hi>June.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Milbourn</hi> lies on the Edge of <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and is very antient; but has neither Market, nor Fair.</p>

               <hi>Camalet</hi> is a noted Place, ſituated on the higheſt Ground in this County, on the Edge of <hi>Dorſetſhire:</hi> its vulgar Name is <hi>Cadbury-caſtle,</hi> from the Village of <hi>North-Cadbury,</hi> wherein it ſtands. Hereabouts riſe the Rivers of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> which run into the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea Weſtward, and that in <hi>Dorſet,</hi> which goes Eaſtward, thro' <hi>Sturminſter,</hi> into the Southern Ocean. It is a noble Fortification of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Proſpect is woody, and very pleaſant; here-and-there lofty and ſteep Hillocks. <hi>Roman</hi> Coins,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0141100402:28"/>
in great Plenty, have been found here, and in all the Country round. The Entrance is guarded with Six or Seven Ditches. On the North-ſide, in the fourth Ditch, is a never failing Spring, called <hi>King</hi> Arthur<hi>'s Well.</hi> Over it they have dug up ſquare Stones, Door-jambs with Hinges, and ſay there are ſubterraneous Vaults thereabout. The Church and Tower of <hi>Cadbury</hi> is ſmall, but neatly built of Stone.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Wincaunton,</hi> an Urn was lately found full of <hi>Roman</hi> Money. Half a Peck of the ſame Coin was diſcovered in incloſing Ground, toward <hi>Beacon-aſh,</hi> a little above <hi>Sutton</hi>; as alſo <hi>Patera's,</hi> a Knife, and other Antiquities, now in Lord <hi>Winchelſca</hi>'s Cuſtody: in particular, at <hi>Long-leat,</hi> in Lord <hi>Weymouth</hi>'s Library, a Piece of Lead weighing 50 Pounds, One Foot Nine Inches long, Two Inches thick, Three and an half broad, found in Lord <hi>Fitzharding</hi>'s Grounds near <hi>Bruton</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> was diſcovered by digging a Hole to ſet a Gate-poſt in, with a legible Inſcription.</p>
            <p>The Road from hence to <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> is over Rocks and Heads of Rivers. But that is alleviated by the many natural Curioſities ſuch Places afford.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kyneton</hi> Village, for half a Mile together, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally paved with one ſmooth broad Rock, the whole Length of the Road; ſo that it looks like Ice.</p>
            <p>Croſſing the <hi>Foſſe</hi> Road at <hi>Lyteford,</hi> you enter a flat mooriſh Country, full of artificial Cuts and Drains. The Aſcent to the <hi>Torr,</hi> which overhangs the Town of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> is very difficult. Upon a narrow Creſt of the <hi>Torr,</hi> which is much the higheſt; the Abbot built a Church to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> of good ſquare Stone. The Tower is left, tho' ruinous, and is an excellent Sea-mark. It probably coſt more to raiſe the Stone to this Height, than to erect the Building. Half way up is a Spring: it is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0141100402:29"/>
certainly higher than any Ground within Ten Miles of the Place. In the Times of Superſtition this great Monaſtery held the firſt Place for Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sanctity.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants will have it, that King <hi>Arthur</hi> was buried here, and, as a Proof thereof, that his Coffin had been found in this Place; and alſo, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had been here, and that when he had fixed his Staff in the Ground, which was on <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> it immediately took Root, budded, put forth White-thorn Leaves, and the next Day was in full Bloſſom, white as a Sheet; and that the Plant is preſerved, and blows every <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> as at firſt, to this very Time.</p>
            <p>I believe the Miracle amounts to no more than this; <hi>viz.</hi> That a kind of White-thorn grows here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, which, in a mild Winter, puts forth ſome Bloſſom about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; and I doubt not, but ſome of the ſame Kind may be found at other Places, if any Obſervations were made of it. But this Place is remarkable for many other marvellous Stories, recorded by the Monks, who formerly poſſeſſed it.</p>
            <p>As to the Burial of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> makes no doubt of it, and gives us from <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> an Account how King <hi>Henry</hi> II. cauſed Search to be made for his Tomb, and before the Workmen had dug Seven Feet deep, they came to a great Stone, having a Croſs of Lead on the Inſide of it, and the ſubſequent Letters or Inſcription upon it, and in the following rude Character; which the ſaid <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, was an Eye-witneſs of, as well as of a Coffin of hollow'd Oak, which they found by digging Nine Feet deeper than the Inſcription, wherein were depoſited the Bones of that great Prince. The Inſcription is as follows:

               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>But to leave theſe more diſputable Points for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greater Certainty: it is not doubted but King <hi>Ina</hi> built the Church of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> as one of the moſt antient, ſo the moſt wealthy and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, loaded with Revenues by the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchs. The Abbot lived in little leſs State than the Royal Donors, his Revenue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0141100402:31"/>
amounting to 40,000<hi>l.</hi> annually. He could from the <hi>Torr</hi> ſee a vaſt Track of this rich Land in his own Poſſeſſion, and Seven Parks well ſtored with Deer belonging to the Monaſtery. 'Tis walled round, and imbattled like a Town, a Mile in Compaſs.</p>
            <p>When I was laſt at <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> there were mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Ruins; but, within a few Years, a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Tenant had made more barbarous Havock there, than had been ſince the Diſſolution; for every Week a Pillar, a Buttreſs, a Window-jamb, or an Angle of fine hewn Stone, was ſold to the beſt Bidder. And they were actually ſtripping <hi>St. Joſeph</hi>'s Chapel for that Purpoſe, and the ſquared Stones were laid up by Lots in the Abbot's Kitchen. The reſt goes to paving Yards and Stalls for Cattle, or to the Highway. So much Dread indeed have the People here of Founders Curſes, that they are afraid to make uſe of the Materials for Dwelling-houſes; and are full of Stories of ſad Accidents and Judgments, that have fallen upon ſuch as have; but venture it for the Highways, for a Town-houſe, and even for Barns and Stables; ſo that, as one obſerves, where few are ſo hardy as to apply them to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or perſonal Uſe, a publick Building ſhall be erected, where all come in for their Snack.</p>
            <p>The Abbot's Lodging was a fine Stone Building, but could not content the juſt-mentioned Tenant, who pulled it down, and out of it built a new Houſe, abſurdly ſetting up the Arms and Cognizances of the great <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings and Princes, who were Founders, and of the Abbots, over his own Doors and Windows. Nothing is left intire, but the Kitchen, a judicious Piece of Architecture. But Tradition ſays, that this is but a modern Building; for the Story goes, That <hi>Whiting,</hi> the laſt Abbot, being dealt with by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and his Cormorants, for a Surrender, and bravely refuſing to join in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0141100402:32"/>
that Prince proceeded to Menaces, and told him, he <q rend="inline margQuotes">"would burn his Kitchen about his Ears."</q>
To which he returned Anſwer,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"That he would build ſuch an one as all the Timber in the Foreſt ſhould not burn."</q>
And accordingly, as 'tis ſaid, built this in Defiance, which is all of firm Stone, Walls and Roof, having nothing combuſtible in it. But what neither Flattery nor Menaces could effect, Tyranny and Murder brought about. For the Abbot was hanged on <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s Tower, juſt now mentioned, on the Top of the high Hill, called <hi>The Torr,</hi> thereby accompliſhing a Prophecy, (as the Townſmen call it; but rather occaſioning a Saying ſince ſpread abroad) <hi>That a</hi> Whiting <hi>ſhould ſwim over</hi> Glaſtenbury Torr.</p>
            <p>The Church was large and magnificent; the Walls of the Choir are ſtanding, 25 Fathom long, and 12 broad. There is one Jamb at the Eaſt-end of the High Altar left.</p>
            <p>Hereabout were buried King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and many of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchs, whoſe noble Aſhes ought to have protected the Whole.</p>
            <p>Two Pillars of the great Middle Tower are left, next the Choir. On the North-ſide is <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s Chapel, as they told me; the Roof beat down by Violence, and a mean wooden one in its Place, thatched with Stubble, to make it ſerve as a Stable. The Manger lies upon the Altar and Nich, where they put the Holy-Water. <hi>St. Edgar</hi>'s Chapel is oppoſite to it; but there is not much left of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Foundations. The preſent Work is 44 Paces long, 36 wide without. The Roof is chiefly wanting. Two little Turrets are at the Corners of the Weſt-end, and Two more at the Interval of Four Windows from thence, which ſeem to indicate the Space of Ground the firſt Chapel was built on: the reſt between it and the Church was a kind of Antechapel. Underneath was a Vault, now full of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0141100402:33"/>
Water, the Floor of the Chapel being beaten down into it: it was wrought with great Stones.</p>
            <p>Here was a capacious Receptacle of the Dead. They have taken up many leaden Coffins, and melted them into Ciſterns.</p>
            <p>The Roof of the Chapel was finely arched with Ribwork of Stone. The Sides of the Walls are full of ſmall Pillars of <hi>Suſſex</hi> Marble, as likewiſe the whole Church, which was a mean way of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting in thoſe Times: they are moſtly beaten down. Between them the Walls are painted with Pictures of Saints, as ſtill eaſily ſeen. All the Walls are overgrown with Ivy, which is the only thing here in a flouriſhing Condition; every thing elſe preſenting a moſt melancholy, tho' venerable Aſpect. On the South-ſide the Cloiſters was the great Hall.</p>
            <p>The Townſmen bought the Stones of the Vaults underneath to build a ſorry Market-houſe, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Benefit accruing to the Town from the great Concourſe of Strangers purpoſely to ſee this Abbey, which is now its greateſt Trade, as formerly its only Support: for 'tis in a moſt miſerable decaying Condition, as wholly cut off from the large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues ſpent among them.</p>
            <p>There are many other Foundations of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings left in the great Area; but in the preſent Hands will ſoon be rooted up, and the very Footſteps of them effaced, which ſo many Ages had been erecting.</p>
            <p>The Abbot's Hall, I have been told, was curiouſly wainſcotted with Oak, and painted with Coats of Arms in every Panel. The Morter of theſe Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is very good, and great Rocks of the Roof of the Church lie upon the Ground, chiefly conſiſting of Rubble-ſtone untouched by the fanatical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, who chiefly work on the hewn Stone of the Outſide, till a whole Wall falls, when under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined a little.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0141100402:34"/>Throughout the Town are the tattered Remains of Doors, Windows, Baſes, Capitals of Pillars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought from the Abbey, and put into every poor Cottage.</p>
            <p>In the Town are Two Churches; the upper a handſome Fabrick with a fine Tower of good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, adorned with Figures in Niches. The <hi>George</hi> Inn is an old Stone Building, called <hi>the Abbot's Inn,</hi> where chiefly the Pilgrims were lodged, who came ſtrolling hither, and idling their Time away for Sanctity. A Coat of Arms of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſupported by a Lion and a Bull, is over the Gate, with many Croſſes. There was a Bed of large Timber, with imboſſed gilt Panels, which ſeemed to have been the Abbot's.</p>
            <p>Four Miles from <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> lies the little City of <hi>Wells,</hi> where is one of the neateſt Cathedrals in <hi>England</hi>; particularly the Weſt Front of it, which is a complete Draught of Imagery, as well as very antient.</p>
            <p>The Cloſe, or Part of the City where the Biſhop's Palace is, is very properly called ſo; for it is walled in, and locked up like a little Fortification, and has a Ditch round it. The dignified Clergy live in the Inſide of it, and the Prebendaries and Canons have very agreeable Dwellings. Here are no leſs than 27 Prebendaries, and 19 Canons, beſides a Dean, a Chancellor, a Precentor, and Three Archdeacons; a Number which very few Cathedrals in <hi>England</hi> have beſides.</p>
            <p>The County is the Dioceſe, and contains 388 Pariſhes, and the Archdeaconries are of <hi>Wells, Bath,</hi> and <hi>Taunton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City lies juſt at the Foot of the Mountains called <hi>Mendip-hills,</hi> and is built on a ſtony Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Its Manufacture is chiefly of Stockens, as has been ſaid; 'tis well-built, and populous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0141100402:35"/>Near this City, and juſt under the Hills, is the famous <hi>Wokey Hole,</hi> the chief Curioſity of which is frequently found in all ſuch ſubterraneous Caverns; that the Water, dropping from the Roof of the Vault, petrifies and hangs in long Pieces like Icicles, as if it would, in Time, turn into a Column to ſupport the Arch.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence is <hi>Sedgmore,</hi> a watry ſplaſhy Place, and infamous for the Defeat of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the low Country, on the other Side <hi>Mendip</hi> Hills, lies <hi>Chedder,</hi> a Village pleaſantly ſituated under the very Ridge of the Mountains: before the Village is a large Green, or Common, on which all the Cows belonging to the Town feed: the Ground is exceeding rich, and as the Inhabitants are Cow-keepers, they take care to maintain the Goodneſs of the Soil, by agreeing to lay on large Quantities of Dung for manuring and inriching the Land.</p>
            <p>Several Perſons frequently, here mix their Milk together, which often weighs a hundred Weight, ſometimes more; and is ſo excellent, that it is often ſold from Six-pence to Eight-pence <hi>per</hi> Pound, when the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Cheeſe is ſold but from Two-pence to Two-pence Half-penny.</p>
            <p>Here is a deep frightful Chaſm in the Mountain, in the Hollow of which the Road goes toward <hi>Briſtol</hi>; and out of the ſame Hollow ſprings a little Stream, which is ſo rapid, that it is ſaid to drive 12 Mills within a Quarter of a Mile of the Spring; but it muſt be ſuppoſed to fetch ſome winding Reaches in the Way; otherwiſe there would not be room for 12 Mills to ſtand, and have a ſufficient Head of Water to each, within ſo ſmall a Space of Ground. The Water of this Spring grows quickly into a River, and runs down into the Marſhes, and joins another little River called <hi>Axe,</hi> about <hi>Axbridge,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Chanel, or <hi>Severn</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0141100402:36"/>I muſt now turn Eaſt, and South-eaſt; for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to go up the Hills of <hi>Mendip</hi> at all, this Journey; leaving that Part to another Tour, when I ſhall give an Account of theſe Mountains, as alſo of the Cities of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to which they are very near, in one Letter.</p>
            <p>I come now to that Part of the County which joins to <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> which I reſerved in particular to this Place, in order to give ſome Account of the Broad-cloth Manufacture, which I ſeveral times mentioned before, and which is carried on here, to ſuch a Degree, as to deſerve a Place in all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions or Hiſtories which ſhall be given of this Country.</p>
            <p>As the Eaſt and South Parts of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> are all hilly, ſpreading themſelves far and wide in Plains, and graſſy Downs, for breeding and feeding vaſt Flocks of Sheep; and as the Weſt and North Parts of <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> are, on the contrary, low and marſhy, or mooriſh, for feeding and breeding of Black Cattle and Horſes, or for Lead Mines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo all the South-weſt Part of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and the Eaſt Part of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> are low and flat, being a rich, incloſed Country, full of Rivers and Towns, and infinitely populous, inſomuch that ſome of the Market-towns are equal to Cities in Bigneſs, and ſuperior to many of them in Numbers of People.</p>
            <p>This low flat Country contains Part of the Three Counties, of <hi>Somerſet, Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi>; and that the Extent of it may be the eaſier underſtood by thoſe who know any thing of the Situation of the Country, it reaches from <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> in the North, to <hi>Sherburn</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> South, and from the <hi>Devizes</hi> Eaſt, to <hi>Briſtol</hi> Weſt, which may take in about 50 Miles in Length where longeſt, and 20 in Breadth where narroweſt.</p>
            <p>In this Extent of Country, we have the following Market-towns, which are principally imployed in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0141100402:37"/>
the Clothing Trade, that is to ſay, in that Part of it, which I am now ſpeaking of, namely, fine Medley, or mixed Cloths, ſuch as are uſually worn in <hi>England</hi> by the better Sort of People; and alſo, exported in great Quantities to <hi>Holland, Hamburgh, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Clothing Towns in this Part of the Country, are theſe,

            <p>Theſe Towns, as they ſtand thin, and at conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Diſtance from one another, (for, except the Two Towns of <hi>Bradford</hi> and <hi>Trubridge,</hi> the others ſtand at an unuſual Diſtance) are interſperſed with a very great Number of Villages, Hamlets, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Houſes, in which, generally ſpeaking, the ſpinning Work of all this Manufacture is performed by the poor People; the Maſter Clothiers, who generally live in the greater Towns, ſending out the Wool weekly to their Houſes, by their Servants and Horſes, and at the ſame time bringing back the Yarn that they have ſpun and finiſhed, which then is fitted for the Loom.</p>
            <p>The increaſing and flouriſhing Circumſtances of this Trade are happily viſible by the great Concourſe of People to, and Increaſe of Buildings and Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0141100402:38"/>
in, theſe principal Clothing Towns, where this Trade is carried on, and in the Wealth of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers. The Town of <hi>Frome,</hi> or, as it is written in our Maps, <hi>Frome-Sellwood,</hi> is a Specimen of this, which is ſo prodigiouſly increaſed within theſe laſt 30 or 40 Years, that they have built a new Church, and ſo many new Streets of Houſes, and theſe Houſes are ſo full of Inhabitants, that <hi>Frome</hi> is now reckoned to have more Inhabitants in it, than the City of <hi>Bath</hi>; and ſome ſay, than <hi>Saliſbury</hi>; and if their Trade continues to increaſe in like manner for a few Years more, it is very likely to become one of the greateſt and wealthieſt inland Towns in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its Trade is wholly Clothing, and the Cloths they make are, generally ſpeaking, all convey'd to <hi>London:</hi> where <hi>Blackwell-hall</hi> is their Market; and, if we may believe common Fame, there are above 10,000 People in <hi>Frome</hi> now, more than lived in it 30 Years ago; and yet it was a conſiderable Town then.</p>
            <p>Here are alſo ſeveral large Meeting-houſes, as well as Churches, as there are, generally, in all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing trading Towns in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in the Weſtern Counties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devizes</hi> is, next to <hi>Frome,</hi> a large and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Town, and full of wealthy Clothiers; but it has lately run pretty much into the Drugget-making Trade; a Buſineſs, which has made ſome Invaſion upon that of the Broad-cloth, great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Druggets being worn in, as well as exported from <hi>England,</hi> inſtead of Broad-cloth; but this is much the ſame as to the Trade ſtill; for ſince it is all a Woolen Manufacture, and the Druggets may properly be called Cloth, tho' narrow, and of a different Make, ſo the Makers are all called Clothiers.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Avon,</hi> a noble and large freſh River, branching itſelf into many Parts, and receiving almoſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0141100402:39"/>
all the Rivers on that Side of the Hills, waters this whole fruitful Vale; and the Water of this River ſeems particularly qualified for dying the beſt Colours, and for Fulling and Dreſſing the Cloth, ſo that the Clothiers generally plant themſelves upon this River, but eſpecially the Dyers, as at <hi>Trubridge</hi> and <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> which are the Two moſt eminent Clothing Towns in that Part of the Vale, for the Making fine <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloths, and for the niceſt Mixtures.</p>
            <p>From theſe Towns, South to <hi>Weſtbury</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> the ſame Trade continues, and the fineſt Medley <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloths in the whole World are made in this Part. They told me at <hi>Bradford,</hi> that it was no extraordinary thing to have Clothiers thereabout worth from 10,000 to 40,000<hi>l.</hi> a Man; and many of the Gentry in thoſe Counties have been originally raiſed from this truly noble Manufacture.</p>
            <p>If I may ſpeak here from the Authority of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Inhabitants of the Place, who have been curious Obſervers upon this Subject, the Country which I have now deſcribed, as principally imployed in, and maintained by this Prodigy of a Trade, contains 2,330,000 Acres of Land, and has in it 788 Pariſhes, and 374,000 People. It is true, that this is all Gueſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; but I muſt confeſs myſelf very willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Reckoning is far ſhort of the Account; for this Part is exceeding large and populous.</p>
            <p>It may be worth Inquiry, how the Manufacturers in ſo vaſt a Conſumption of the Wool, as ſuch a Trade muſt take up, can be ſupplied with Wool for their Trade; and indeed it would be ſomething ſtrange, if the Anſwer were not at hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may reaſonably conclude, that this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture was at firſt ſeated in this County, or, as we may ſay, originally planted itſelf here, becauſe of the infinite Numbers of Sheep, which were always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Downs and Plains of <hi>Dorſet, Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> all adjoining. This, no doubt, induced
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0141100402:40"/>
the firſt Planters of the Clothing Manufacture to make Choice of this delightful Vale in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of thoſe Plains, which afforded ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Funds of Wool for the carrying on their Works. Thus the Manufacture of white Cloth was planted in <hi>Stroud-water</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> for the ſake of the excellent Water there for the Dying Scarlets, and all Colours that are dyed in Grain, which are better done there, than in any other Place of <hi>England,</hi> ſome Towns near <hi>London</hi> excepted. Hence therefore we firſt obſerve, they are ſupplied yearly with the Fleeces of Two or Three Millions of Sheep.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as the Number of Sheep fed on theſe Downs is leſſened, rather than increaſed, becauſe of ſo many thouſand Acres of the Carpet Ground being of late Years converted into Tillage, and ſowed with <note n="*" place="bottom">This Alteration has made <hi>Warminſter,</hi> a Market-town on the Edge of <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> the greateſt Market for Wheat in <hi>England,</hi> where none of it is bought to ſend to <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> Wheat; and at the ſame time the Manufacture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly increaſing; the Manufacturers applied to other Parts for a Supply, and hence began the Influx of North Country Wool from the Counties of <hi>Northampton, Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the Centre and Markets of which Trade are about <hi>Tetbury</hi> and <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> where ſeveral hundred Packs are ſold every Week, to ſupply this prodigious Conſumption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From <hi>London</hi> they have great Quantities of Wool, which is generally called <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Wool, in the Fleece, which is brought up from thence by the Farmers, ſince the late ſevere Acts againſt their Selling it within a certain Number of Miles of the Sea; alſo Fell-wool for the Combers, bought of the Wool-ſtaplers in <hi>Barnaby-ſtreet,</hi> and ſent back by the Carriers which bring up the Cloths to Market.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They have alſo, ſometimes, large Quantities of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wool by the way of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> or of <hi>Minehead</hi> in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0141100402:41"/>
               <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi>; but this is uncertain, and only on extraordinary Occaſions. I omit the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, as being an Article by itſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus, as thoſe who ſee the almoſt countleſs Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Sheep on the Downs and Plains, and the great Quantities of Wool brought to the Markets of <hi>Tetbury,</hi> and other Towns, as well as what are ſent down from <hi>London</hi> into this ſingle Vale, would wonder how it was poſſible ſo much Wool could be conſumed, manufactured, and wrought up; ſo, on the other hand, thoſe that ſee what Numbers of People are imployed, and what vaſt Quantities of Goods are made, in this Part of <hi>England,</hi> would wonder how the Nation ſhould be able to ſupply them with Wool.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwithſtanding the whole Country is thus buſy'd in the Broad-cloth Manufacture, I muſt not omit to mention, that here is a very great Application to another Branch or two of Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſupplying the City of <hi>London</hi> with Proviſions: Tho' it is true, that the general Imployment of the People in all this County, is in the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture; yet, as the Spinning is generally the Work of the Women and Children, and the Land is here exceeding rich and fertile, ſo it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but that here are Farmers in great Numbers, whoſe Buſineſs it is to cultivate the Land, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the reſt of the Inhabitants with Proviſions; and this they do ſo well, that notwithſtanding the County is exceeding populous, yet Proviſions of all Sorts are cheap, the Quantity very great, and a conſiderable Overplus ſent every Day to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the lower Part of this County, and alſo of <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> adjoining, is full of large feeding Farms, which we call Dairies; and the Cheeſe they make is excellent, and is eaten newer than that from <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> Of this a vaſt Quantity is every Week ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> where, tho' it is called <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0141100402:42"/>
Cheeſe, yet the greateſt Part of it comes from <hi>Wiltſhire</hi>; the <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> Cheeſe being more generally carried to <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Bath,</hi> where a very great Quantity is conſumed, as well by the Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of theſe two populous Cities, as in Exportation to our <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Colonies, and other Places; whereas this <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Cheeſe is carried to the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> which runs thro' Part of the County, by Land-carriage, and ſo by Barges to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in the Spring of the Year, they make a vaſt Quantity of that we call Green or New Cheeſe, which is a thin and very ſoft Cheeſe, reſembling Cream Cheeſes, but ſomewhat thicker. Theſe are ſo univerſally liked in <hi>London,</hi> that all the low rich Lands of this County are hardly enough to ſupply the Market; but then this holds for little more than the Two firſt Summer Months of the Year.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the Farmers in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and the Part of <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> adjoining, ſend a very great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bacon up to <hi>London,</hi> which is eſteemed the beſt Bacon in <hi>England, Hampſhire</hi> only excepted. This Bacon is raiſed here, by their great Dairies, as the Hogs are fed with the vaſt Quantities of Whey, and ſkimmed Milk, which the Farmers muſt otherwiſe have thrown away.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; for as the North Part of <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> as well the Downs as the Vales, border upon the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and in ſome Places come up even to the Banks of it, ſo moſt of that Part of the County being arable Land, they ſow a very great Quantity of Barley, which is carried to the Markets at <hi>Abingdon,</hi> at <hi>Faringdon,</hi> and ſuch Places, where it is made into Malt, and carried to <hi>London.</hi> This imploys all the Hill-country from above <hi>Malmſbury</hi> to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and on the Side of the Vale of <hi>White-horſe,</hi> as 'tis called, which is in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> and the Hills adjoining; a Track of fertile Ground, which furniſhes a prodigious Quantity of Barley.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0141100402:43"/>Thus <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> helps to ſupply <hi>London</hi> with Cheeſe, Bacon, and Malt, Three very conſiderable Articles, beſides that vaſt Manufacture of fine <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cloths, of which I have ſaid ſo much; and I may without Partiality ſay, that it is thereby rendered one of the moſt important Counties in <hi>England</hi> to the publick Wealth of the Kingdom. The bare Product is in itſelf prodigiouſly great; the Downs are an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Store-houſe of Wool, and of Corn; and the Valley, or low Part of it, is the like for Cheeſe and Bacon.</p>
            <p>One Thing here is worth while to mention, for the Obſervation of thoſe Counties in <hi>England,</hi> where they are not yet arrived to that Perfection in Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, as in this County; and I have purpoſely reſerved it to this Place; and that is, The Downs or Plains, which tho' generally called <hi>Saliſbury Plain,</hi> yet extend themſelves into the Counties of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, Wilts,</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> were formerly wholly taken up with Sheep, as being thought incapable of producing Grain, but now are made to yield moſt plentiful Crops, by folding their Sheep upon the plough'd Lands, removing the Fold every Night to a freſh Place, till the whole Fallow has been folded on. This alone has made theſe Lands, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are poor, and, in ſome Places, ſo ſhallow as that the Earth is not ſix Inches deep over the ſolid Chalk, able to bear as good Wheat, as any of the richer Lands in the Vales, tho' not altogether in ſuch great Quantities: And were it not for this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Product would hardly compenſate the Ploughman's Labour; for many of theſe Lands lie up ſuch high Hills, ſo remote from the Farmers Houſes, which are always in the Valleys, that it would be very difficult to carry up their Dung to manure them.</p>
            <p>If this way of folding Sheep upon the Fallows and ploughed Lands were practiſed in ſome other Parts
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0141100402:44"/>
of <hi>Britain,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it would effectually improve the waſte Lands, which now are uſeleſs and uncultivated, and turn both Sheep and Lands to a better Account than was ever yet known among them. In <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> it appears to be ſo, very ſignificantly; for if a Farmer has a Thouſand Sheep, and no Fallows to fold them on, his Neighbours will give him Ten Shillings a Night for every Thouſand.</p>
            <p>But as I have not mentioned theſe Clothing Towns other than as they contribute to that Trade, I ſhall now proceed to ſay ſomething of the Towns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, except thoſe in <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi>; of which I ſhall ſpeak in my next Letter, as I fall down Weſtward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shipton-Mallet, Caſtle Carey, Wincaunton,</hi> and <hi>Bruton,</hi> lie to the Southward of <hi>Wells,</hi> and have nothing remarkable in them except the laſt, which lies on the River <hi>Brews.</hi> It has a fair Church, a good Free-ſchool, and a ſtately Alms-houſe, the Ruins of a Priory, and beſide the Clothing-trade, is famous for Stockens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frome,</hi> and <hi>Philips Norton,</hi> lie Eaſt of <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>Wilts.</hi> The firſt is near the Foreſt of <hi>Selwood,</hi> and I have already mentioned its prodigious Increaſe of late Years. The laſt is a very good Market-town, and has Two annual Fairs, one reputed, for a One-day Fair, as great as any in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bensford</hi> is a ſmall Market-town, and lies North-weſt toward <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malmſbury</hi> is a very antient Town, and, 'tis ſaid, was built by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince, called <hi>Caer Bladdon.</hi> It was formerly defended by Walls, and a large ſtrong Caſtle, which was razed afterward, to inlarge the Abbey, which was very famous, and the greateſt in <hi>Wiltſhire:</hi> the Abbot ſat in Parliament. King <hi>Athelſtane</hi> was buried here, and they ſtill ſhew
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0141100402:45"/>
his Tomb here. Vaſt Piles of Buildings were pulled down at the Diſſolution, but the Church of the Abbey was ſaved, a great Part of which ſtill remains, and is uſed as the Pariſh Church. It is a Corporation governed by a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> who is an annual Magiſtrate, and called <hi>The Alderman.</hi> It has a good Market weekly. The Town is neat, and lies on the River <hi>Avon.</hi> It is alſo famous for the Birth-place of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmſbury,</hi> the Hiſtorian; and of that great Scholar, Philoſopher, and Mathematician, <hi>Hobbes</hi>; and of divers other very great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Men.</p>
            <p>Near this Town, Southward, on the ſame River, lies the Village of <hi>Dantſey,</hi> which, tho' but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Place, has given Title of Honour to many eminent Perſons, and among the reſt, to <hi>Henry Danvers,</hi> created Baron of this Place by King <hi>James</hi> I. tho' afterwards made Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi> He had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wars, was as good as great, and died with Glory; but his Brother and Heir, having ſat, ungratefully, a Judge on that very King who made his Brother Earl, was, at the Reſtoration, attainted of High Treaſon; and this his Manor of <hi>Dantſey</hi> given to <hi>James</hi> then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who ſettled it in Dowry on his ſecond Conſort. On his Abdication, it became a ſecond time forfeited, and King <hi>William</hi> conferred it on <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Mordaunt,</hi> late Earl of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> and <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in whoſe Family it ſtill remains. But as there are ſome other Things more than ordinarily particular, relating to this Manor, I ſhall inlarge a little upon it.</p>
            <p>The whole Pariſh of <hi>Dantſey</hi> conſiſts of this Manor only, and not a Foot of Ground in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to any other Perſon: it is altogether Paſture, and indeed very rich. The Inhabitants, who are all Tenants of the Manor, make moſt excellent Cheeſe, not at all inferior to that of <hi>Chedder,</hi> which is the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0141100402:46"/>
only Commodity in the Place; for the late Lord would not permit the Grounds to be ploughed up; and, I believe, there is not an Acre in the Pariſh of arable Land, tho' the Tenants have offered a conſiderable Advance of Rent, for Liberty to break up the Ground, which indeed ſeems to want it, and would be much better'd by the Plough; nor would his Lordſhip, for ſome Years before his Death, renew a Life upon it, either by Leaſe or Copyhold, except as many of the laſt, as would keep up the Homage, and the Rights of the Manor: and the Reaſon of this was, not only to get a clear Rack-rent Eſtate in it, but to prevent the Cheats and Impoſitions which the Copyhold Tenants of the Manor put upon their Lord; for as every Widow has her Life in her Huſband's Copyhold after his Death, if ſhe continues ſole and continent, 'tis a very common thing there for an old Man, on his Death-bed, to marry a young Woman, who privately contracts to give Part of the Profits of the Copyhold, or ſome Conſideration for it, to the Huſband's Relations, and not ſeldom ſelects, for a Bedfellow for herſelf, one of her favourite Men-ſervants.</p>
            <p>The Abuſe which accrued from granting Leaſes on Lives is this, That whereas a Perſon takes a Leaſe for Three Lives, <hi>viz.</hi> his own, his Wife's, and his Son <hi>John</hi>'s; to defraud the Lord of the Manor, he names all his Sons <hi>John</hi>; ſo that, as long as any of the Sons live, <hi>John</hi> in the Leaſe never dies.</p>
            <p>By theſe Frauds, the Earl, who was none of the beſt Oeconomiſts, and lived remote from this Place, ſuffered conſiderably, tho' he could not find out how; but frequently complained, That his Leſſees, and his Copyhold-Widows, were very long lived; and, in an humorous way, uſed to recommend his Manor of <hi>Dantſey</hi> to all ſuch as were apprehenſive of dying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0141100402:47"/>As all in the Pariſh were his Tenants, and had an Intereſt in the Fraud, they combined againſt him, ſo that he could get no Intelligence of it: and tho' his Lordſhip enjoyed the Manor ever ſince the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, yet, by reaſon of its being then full eſtated, that is, all let out upon Lives then actually ſubſiſting, and continued by the above-mentioned Frauds, his Lordſhip received no great Benefit out of it till ſome few Years before his Death; when he came to a Reſolution not to renew, tho', when all the Lives drop in, this Manor will, at a Rack-rent, amount to at leaſt 3000<hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>There is a large old Manſion-houſe here, lying juſt on the River, with Gardens formed after the Manner of thoſe at <hi>Parſons-green</hi>; but it is not a kindly Place for ripening Fruit, and the Grounds lie very low and ſplaſhy, being all of a ſtiff Clay, and yet very good Paſture. Here is alſo a fine Park well timber'd, but without Deer. His Lordſhip had once a Deſign to improve this Manſion-houſe and Eſtate, and reſided here in 1705, when he was called to Court, and ſent to command the Queen's Forces in <hi>Spain,</hi> where his Conduct, and great Services to his Country, are too well known to need men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning here.</p>
            <p>Tho' this Place is often overflowed with Water, yet there is none good, either for Brewing or Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any Spring of ſweet Water. Here is a Spring of a chalybeat Kind, which would turn to good Account, were it not in ſuch a diſtant, and an almoſt inacceſſible Part of the Country, occaſioned by bad Roads, which were a great Protection to the Inhabitants in the late Civil Wars, who were never viſited by either Party; but injoyed an eaſy and uninterrupted Repoſe, whliſt their Neighbours, on all Sides, were involved in the Calamities of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0141100402:48"/>Here is likewiſe a good neat Church, with one of the beſt-built, high, ſquare Towers I ever ſaw, raiſed at the Expence of one of the Lords of <hi>Dantſey,</hi> probably the afore-mentioned <hi>Henry,</hi> who lies buried here under a very large magnificent Tomb. Here likewiſe is interred Lieutenant-General <hi>Lewis Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt,</hi> a Brother of the late Earl, a Gentleman noted for his great Wit, Humour, and polite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as indeed all his Brothers were, as well as his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtlecomb</hi> is a Village of ſmall Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chippenham</hi> is a corporate, good Market-town, likewiſe on the River <hi>Avon,</hi> over which it has a Bridge of Sixteen Arches, famous for the Reſidence and Reſort of many of the Weſt <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Alfred.</hi> Here is a very magnificent Church; and near this Place, formerly, was a famous Foreſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bradford</hi> is a Market-town, and has a Bridge over the <hi>Avon.</hi> 'Tis well-built of Stone, and lies in the Side of a Hill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trubridge</hi> is an antient Market-town, and had formerly a Caſtle of Seven Towers, but long ſince deſtroyed. The Court of the Duchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> for this County, is annually held here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weſtbury</hi> is a little Borough Market-town, but was formerly of great Note. Some Quantity of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins have been found here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Warminſter</hi> is noted, as I have ſaid, for the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Quantity of Corn, which is ſold in it every Market-day. Upon the Downs, near this Town, are two antient Camps, ſuppoſed to be <hi>Daniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable, That theſe Five laſt Towns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed antiently to the Family of the <hi>Hungerfords,</hi> which in King <hi>Edward</hi> IV.'s Reign came by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who being executed in <hi>Richard</hi> III.'s Time, this vaſt Eſtate was given by that King to <hi>Howard,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> firſt Earl-Marſhal of that Family, in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0141100402:49"/>Near <hi>Warminſter</hi> is the famous Foreſt of <hi>Selwood,</hi> called by the antient <hi>Britons, Coedmaur,</hi> i. e. <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi> It is 15 Miles in Length, and very thick of Wood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mere,</hi> which in the old <hi>Saxon</hi> ſignifys <hi>Boundary,</hi> as this Place ſeems to be on the Borders of <hi>Wilts, Somerſet,</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> is but a Village, and yet gives Name to the Hundred where it ſtands. It has neither Fair nor Market in it; but it had, antiently, a Caſtle. Not far from this Place is an old <hi>Daniſh</hi> Camp called <hi>Whiteſhole-hill.</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Cotton,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Charles</hi> I. was born here.</p>
            <p>A little South-eaſt of <hi>Mere</hi> lies <hi>Hindon,</hi> a ſmall Borough and Market-town. And North-eaſt of it ſtands <hi>Heightsbury,</hi> an inconſiderable Town; but noted formerly for an Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lavington</hi> is alſo a little more North; a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Market-town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devizes</hi> is excellently ſituated, about Two Miles from the Bottom of the Hills, which keep off the Eaſtern Winds, and in a rich Soil. Under the Hill, at <hi>Runway,</hi> is an excellent Spring, which the Inhabitants have not yet found Means to convey thither, tho' it runs but a little way off the Town, where they want Water. It is a very large old Town, conſiſting chiefly of Two long parallel Streets, the Houſes moſtly of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but of a very good Model. The Inhabitants value themſelves for being Tenants to the King, and for one of the beſt weekly Markets in <hi>England.</hi> The Caſtle was originally <hi>Roman,</hi> judiciouſly ſeated upon a natural Fortification; but in After-times, made in a manner impregnable by <hi>Roger,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> tho' now it ſuffers daily by Peoples taking away the Materials. Here are Two Churches. The Choir of <hi>St. Mary's</hi> is of a very old Model, as are the Steeple, Choir, and both Wings of <hi>St. John's,</hi> to which Additions have been made; and new wide Windows with pointed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0141100402:50"/>
Arches, in the room of the antient, narrow, ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular ones.</p>
            <p>Juſt out of Town is a pretty Plain called <hi>the Green,</hi> with another handſome Church and Steeple, Suburbs to the old Town. Here <hi>William Cadby,</hi> a Gardener, dug up his Collection of Gods, which he carried about for a Shew. They were found in a Garden in a Cavity incloſed with <hi>Roman</hi> Brick. The <hi>Venus</hi> is of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Deſign; and the <hi>Veſtal Virgin,</hi> as they call it, a Fragment of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Braſs, and of very curious Workmanſhip. <hi>Vulcan</hi> is as lame as if made at a Forge. He had alſo ſeveral Coins found thereabouts, and a Braſs <hi>Roman</hi> Key, which my Lord <hi>Winchelſea</hi> bought. <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities are diſcovered here every Day. The ſame Nobleman has a Braſs <hi>Probus</hi>; on the Reverſe <hi>Victoria Germ.</hi> with a Trophy. A great Number of ſuch Reliques is to be met with all round the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calne</hi> is a little Town, ſituate on a ſtony Hill, and very antient, and is ſuppoſed to have been one of the Seats of the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> Kings. It has a neat Church, and a good weekly Market. After a great Rain, in <hi>November</hi> 1725, the Waters roſe ſo very high here, on a ſudden, that they overflow'd the Town, damaged a great Quantity of Goods, drowned Two Men in the Street, and carried off a Caſk of Oil of 100 Gallons, which could not be found for ſeveral Days after. A great Parcel of <hi>Roman</hi> Coins were dug up here formerly. Here was, likewiſe, antiently an Hoſpital of <hi>Black Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now come into the Road to <hi>Marlborough:</hi> On the Downs, about Two or Three Miles from the Town, are abundance of looſe Stones, lying ſcattered about the Plain, ſome whereof are very large, and appear to be of the ſame Kind with thoſe of <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> and ſome larger: they are called by the Country People, the <hi>Grey Weathers</hi>; and it muſt be confeſſed, that they look not unlike Sheep ſtraggling upon the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0141100402:51"/>
Downs, on a tranſient and diſtant View, as Travellers paſs. Theſe <hi>Grey Weathers,</hi> on a more curious Inſpection, are found to be a Sort of white Marble, and lie upon the Surface of the Ground in infinite Numbers, and of all Dimenſions. They are looſe, detached from any Rock, and, as Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> thinks, lay there ever ſince the Creation, being ſolid Parts thrown out to the Surface of the fluid Globe, when its Rotation was firſt impreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marlborough,</hi> ſo called from its Hills of Chalk, which antiently was called <hi>Marle.</hi> It is the <hi>Cunetia</hi> (from <hi>Kenet</hi>) of the <hi>Romans</hi>; but from the coming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to the Conqueſt, there is no Mention of it. It is governed by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgeſſes, and is well-built. It conſiſts chiefly of One broad and ſtrait Street. To the South are ſome Relicks of a Priory; the Gate-houſe is ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On the North, the Chapel of another Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſe remains, now turned into a Dwelling-houſe. The Seat of my Lord <hi>Hertford</hi> was the Scite of the <hi>Roman Coſtrum</hi>; for there they find Foundations, and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins; and towards the River, without the Garden-walls, one Angle of it very manifeſtly remains; and the Rampart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d Ditch intire. The Road going over the Bridge cuts it off from the preſent Caſtle. The Ditch is ſtill 20 Feet wide in ſome Parts. The Mount, ſo much noted, was the Keep of the Caſtle; it is now converted into a pretty ſpiral Walk, on the Top of which is an octagonal Summer-houſe, from whence you have a pleaſant View over the Town and County. The Town has at preſent a pretty good Shop-keeping Trade, but not much of the manufacturing Part. The River <hi>Kennet,</hi> ſome Years ago made navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable by Act of Parliament, riſes juſt by this Town; from whence running to <hi>Hungerford</hi> and <hi>Newbury,</hi> it becomes a large Stream; and paſſing by <hi>Reading,</hi> runs into the <hi>Thames</hi> near that Town.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0141100402:52"/>
This River is famous for Crayfiſh, which they help Travellers to at <hi>Newbury</hi>; but they ſeldom want for Price.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Abury,</hi> near <hi>Marlborough</hi> Downs, in the Way to <hi>Bath,</hi> are to be ſeen the ſtupendous Remains of a <hi>Druids</hi> Temple, being a Collection of monſtrous Stones of the like Nature with thoſe of <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> and brought together from the Downs for the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Purpoſes, as Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> makes no Queſtion.</p>
            <p>On the Hills on this Side the <hi>Devizes</hi> is <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Down,</hi> where the King's Forces, under Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> but owing chiefly to the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> beat and intirely routed the famous Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> in the Civil Wars; from whence the Place is called by ſome, <hi>Run-away Down,</hi> to this Day.</p>
            <p>A little nearer towards <hi>Marlborough</hi> is <hi>St. Ann's Hill,</hi> where, notwithſtanding ſeveral high Hills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and the Diſtance of Twenty-two Miles, or more, is a fair View of <hi>Saliſbury</hi> Steeple, or Spire, which is deem'd the higheſt in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>At <hi>Badmington</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> have been found <hi>Nine Caves</hi> all in a Row, but of different Dimenſions, the leaſt of them Four Feet wide, ſome Nine or Ten Feet long, Two long Stones being ſet upon the Sides, and the Top cover'd with broad Stones. Spurs, Pieces of Armour, and the like, have been found in theſe <hi>Caves</hi>; which gives Ground to believe, that they were Tombs of ſome antient Warriors, <hi>Romans, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes.</hi>

and render'd very pleaſant and delightful by the many Walks and Viſtas lately cut and levell'd through the ſeveral Coppices and Woods with which it abounds. Eight of theſe Viſtas meet like ſo many Rays of a Star, in a Point near the Middle of the Foreſt, where his Lordſhip has prepared and cleared the Ground for erecting an Octagon Tower, whoſe Sides will be correſpondent to the Viſtas, thro' one of which you will have a View of his Lordſhip's Seat at about Two Miles Diſtance, called <hi>Tottenham,</hi> from a Park of that Name, in which it is ſituate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the Foreſt.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtately Edifice, newly erected on the ſame Spot of Ground where ſtood an antient Palace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Fire, of the Marquis of <hi>Hereford,</hi> ſo juſtly celebrated for his ſteady Adherence, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſiſtance, to the Royal Cauſe, during the whole Courſe of the Civil Wars, from whom his Lordſhip is deſcended, by his Mother the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Siſter and Niece to the Two laſt Dukes of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> of the elder Line.</p>
            <p>To give you ſome Idea of the Grandeur and Magnificence of the Structure, it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obſerve, that it was begun, carried on and finiſh'd, after the Model, and under the Direction, of our modern <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Burlington,</hi> who, to the Strength and Convenience of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Architecture, has added the Elegance and Politeneſs of the <hi>Italian</hi> Taſte.</p>
            <p>The Houſe has Four Towers, and Four Fronts, each of them diverſly beautified and adorned; to which are now added Four Wings, wherein are Rooms of State, a noble and capacious Room for a Library, containing a judicious and large Collection of ſeveral Thouſand Books in all Languages, but eſpecially the modern.</p>
            <p>The Beauty and Delightfulneſs of the Buildings are much augmented by the large Canals, the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0141100402:54"/>
and well-planted Walks which ſurround it, one of which, leading to the <hi>London</hi> Road, extends Two Miles in Length.</p>
            <p>About the ſame Diſtance from hence, on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Side, are to be ſeen the Remains of a large Houſe, the Seat of Sir <hi>John Seymour,</hi> Father of the unfortunate Protector, call'd <hi>Wolf-Hall,</hi> of which no more is ſtanding than ſuffices for a Farm-houſe. Here King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. as, Tradition goes, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated his Nuptials with the Lady <hi>Jane Seymour,</hi> and kept his Wedding-dinner, in a very large Barn, hung with Tapeſtry on the Occaſion; for Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of which they ſhew you, in the Walls thereof, ſome Tenter-hooks, with ſmall Pieces of Tapeſtry faſten'd to them; and between this Place and <hi>Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From hence, continuing our Courſe Eaſterly, we came to a Borough-town, called <hi>Great Bedwin,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> takes to be the <hi>Leucomagus</hi> of <hi>Ravennas.</hi> It is an old Corporation, and gave Birth to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. <hi>T.

Some time ſince there was in the Eaſt Window of the Church, the Picture of a Prieſt, with Two Crutches, a Cup in his Hand, and a Can ſtanding by him, with an Inſcription in old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Capitals, but in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage obſolete <hi>French,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is this:

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0141100402:55"/>The Church is large and capacious, in which are ſome antient Monuments, particularly one of a <hi>Knight-Templar,</hi> call'd <hi>Adam of Scott,</hi> from a Manor of that Name in the Pariſh, with an Inſcription not legible, and another above-mentioned of Sir <hi>John Seymour,</hi> Father of the Protector, wherein we have an Account of the Names of all his Children, with their ſeveral Inter-marriages and Deaths The Church is very ſtrongly built with Flint, and a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment near as hard as themſelves, in form of a Croſs, in the Centre of which is erected a high Tower, containing a good Ring of Six very muſical Bells.</p>
            <p>Moving hence towards the North-eaſt a little, we croſs'd the much fam'd <hi>Wanſdyke,</hi> a Work of prodigious Labour and Expence, and concluded by moſt Writers to be a Boundary of one of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> probably that of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> before its Inlargement by incroaching on other Kingdoms. It may be traced from near <hi>Bath,</hi> all over the Downs, to this Place, where it turns its Courſe towards the Southern Coaſts: it is ſuppoſed, by ſome, to derive its Name from <hi>Woden,</hi> one of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Deities.</p>
            <p>Soon after we mounted a ſmall Hill, of eaſy Aſcent, on the Summit of which was erected, as Hiſtorians inform us, a fortified Place, the Reſidence of <hi>Ciſſa,</hi> a Viceroy of one of the <hi>South-Saxon</hi> Kings, from whom it derives its Denomination of <hi>Chiſbury,</hi> or <hi>Ciſbury,</hi> who alſo built <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> for the Reſort of his People, as he did this for the Repoſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It ſeems to have been ſtrongly fortified, being ſurrounded with a double Ditch or Mote, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Depth and Breadth, and full of Water: ſince which time there has been a Religious Houſe here, the Chapel of which is ſtill remaining, but converted into a Barn.</p>
            <p>From hence we returned to the great <hi>London</hi> Road, and ſoon arrived at a Village called <hi>Froxfield,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0141100402:56"/>
about Seven Miles from <hi>Marlborough,</hi> in which is a handſome and well-endow'd Alms-houſe, founded by <hi>Sarah</hi> Ducheſs Dowager of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Relict of <hi>John</hi> the laſt Duke of the elder Branch of the noble Family of <hi>Seymours,</hi> deſcended from the great Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Protector of the King and Kingdom, during the Minority of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. This Lady bequeath'd by her Will above 2000<hi>l.</hi> for the Building and Furniture of this Alms-houſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſeveral Manors, Meſſuages, and Farms, for the Maintenance of Thirty poor Widows, not have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 20<hi>l. per Ann</hi> to ſubſiſt upon; one Half of which are Widows of Clergymen, and the other of Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, giving a Preference to thoſe of the laſt Sort, who live on the Manors ſo deviſed by her. She left in her Will particular Directions for the Form, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, and Scite of the Structure, and for the Manner of electing, ruling, and providing for the Widows, which her Executors, eſpecially Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Gregory,</hi> who chiefly took upon him the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truſt, punctually obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>The Building is neat and ſtrong, in the Form of a Quadrangle, having one Front, and a Court before it facing the Road. It contains Thirty Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, and as many Chambers, one of each Sort being allowed to every Widow, for her Apartment, with an Area or Bed in a Garden, on the North Part of the Building, incloſed with a Brick-wall.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the Quadrangle is built a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and convenient Chapel, furniſhed with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table, Pulpit, Deſk, Pews and Books, for the Uſe of the Widows, wherein the Chaplain, whoſe Stipend is 30<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> is to read Prayers every Day, and to preach on <hi>Sundays:</hi> and for his further Encouragement, is to be preſented, on a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, to the Rectory of <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> in the ſame County, which the Ducheſs has appropriated to that Uſe. Beſides the yearly Penſion in Money, which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0141100402:57"/>
is now about Eight Guineas, ſhe hath alſo ordered a Cloth-gown, with a certain Quantity of Wood every Winter, to each of the Widows: and when the Eſtates which ſhe has given to the ſaid Almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, (many of which are now demiſed upon Leaſes for Lives) ſhall fall in, and ſhall produce a clear yearly Income of more than 400<hi>l.</hi> ſhe hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed additional Lodgings to be built for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Twenty more Widows, who are to be placed on the ſame Eſtabliſhment, elected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in the ſame manner as the Thirty former; and then all the Rents and Profits of the ſaid Eſtates (the Salary for the Chaplain and a Steward being firſt deducted) ſhall be diſtributed in equal Shares and Proportions between the Fifty Widows.</p>
            <p>The Produce of all the Eſtates deviſed to this, and another charitable Uſe, which I ſhall mention by-and-by, upon the Determination of the Leaſes granted, will, according to the beſt Information I could get, amount to little leſs than 1000<hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truly uſeful and excellent Charity, which diſplays the Judgment, as well as charitable Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the noble Foundreſs, is under the Inſpection and Management of ſeveral worthy Gentlemen and Clergymen of the Neighbourhood, who diſcharge the Truſt repoſed in them with a very laudable Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Integrity, <hi>ſcrupulouſly,</hi> or religiouſly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, purſuing the Directions of the Will, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preventing all Imbezelments, and frequently meeting, at their own Expence, for the Diſpatch of Buſineſs in the Execution of their Truſt; which worthy Example, if imitated by other Truſtees or Directors of charitable Benefactions, (who too often make a Property of their Truſt) would be of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Emolument, and ſingular Benefit to the Poor, by reſcuing charitable Deviſes from the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they now lie under, and rendering unneceſſary
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0141100402:58"/>
the Trouble and Expence of applying for, and ſuing out Commiſſions of Charitable Uſes.</p>
            <p>The ſame charitable Lady, to make Proviſion for the helpleſs Young, as well as deſtitute Old, has alſo bequeathed a conſiderable yearly Sum for the apprenticing of Ten or Twelve Children, in which a Preference is to be given to ſuch as were born in her Manors. In the Management of which Truſt, another Set of Truſtees act, with the ſame commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Uncorruptneſs and Integrity as the former.</p>
            <p>We next came to <hi>Hungerford,</hi> a little Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, ſituate in a Mooriſh-place, remarkable only for being a great Thoroughfare to <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> and for Plenty of Trout and Crayfiſh. It is governed by the Lord of the Manor, as Conſtable, who is however choſen annually into that Office. From this Town the antient Family of the Barons of <hi>Hungerford</hi> took their Name and Title. The firſt of the Family was the firſt Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, in 51. <hi>Edward</hi> III. They poſſeſs'd a vaſt Eſtate this Way, and in all the neighbouring Counties, which was twice forfeited for their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> This vaſt Eſtate fell by a Daughter to the famous Lord <hi>Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> who was executed in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> III. when <hi>Howard,</hi> firſt Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> had a Grant of it from that Prince, who falling with his Maſter in the Battle of <hi>Boſworth-Field,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. reſtored it, with the Honour, to a younger Branch of the <hi>Hungerfords,</hi> who had joined him, and ſhared in the Glory of that Victory. But his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants ſuffer'd Death for Treaſon, 31 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. tho' Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reſtored them again. He was the Third of the Family who died for Treaſon: ſuch Viciſſitudes attended this noble Family, and their great Eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0141100402:59"/>We purſued the great Road, and arrived at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> ſituate in a moſt fruitful Plain, and water'd by the River <hi>Kennet,</hi> which is made navigable up to the Town, which carries on a very great Trade in Malt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>London.</hi> It is governed by a Mayor, High Steward, Aldermen and Burgeſſes. The Streets are ſpacious, and the Market-place large, where there is great Store of Corn ſold; and a Hall for the Buſineſs of the Corporation ſtands in it.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo a good Charity-ſchool, very well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd, and this Place is noted for good Trout and Crayfiſh.</p>
            <p>Near this Town was a double Scene of Blood; for here were Two obſtinate Battles fought at different Times, between the King's Army and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's, King <hi>Charles</hi> being preſent at them both, and both were fought almoſt upon the ſame Spot of Ground. In theſe Two Battles it was obſerved by an experienced Soldier, who ſerved in the King's Army, that the Generals on both Sides ſhewed the moſt exquiſite Skill in the managing, poſting, bringing up, and drawing off their Troops; and the Men fought with equal Bravery. In the firſt of theſe Battles the Succeſs was doubtful, and both Sides claim'd the Advantage: in the laſt, the King's Army had apparently the worſt of it, and yet the King in a very few Days, with a great Body of Horſe, brought off his Cannon, which he had, in the Cloſe of the Battle, thrown into <hi>Dunington</hi> Caſtle, and carried them away to <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Head Quarter of his Army; and this he did in the Sight of the victorious Army, facing them at the ſame time with a Body of Six thouſand Horſe; they, on the other hand, not thinking fit to draw out to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him. That Retreat, in point of Honour, was equal to a Victory, and gave new Courage, as well as Reputation, to the King's Troops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0141100402:60"/>Part of <hi>Newbury</hi> is alſo known by the Name of <hi>Spinham-lands.</hi> For it aroſe out of the Ruins of an old Town, called <hi>Spine,</hi> the Remains of which now join to <hi>Newbury,</hi> in reſpect to which it was called <hi>New Borough,</hi> and for Shortneſs <hi>Newbury.</hi> It is noted, among other Things, for Two or Three good Inns, where Travellers are well accommodated.</p>
            <p>This Town of <hi>Newbury</hi> was an antient Clothing Town, tho' now little of that Buſineſs remains to it; but it retains ſtill a manufacturing Genius, and the People are generally imployed in making Shalloon, which, tho' it be uſed only for the Lining and Inſides of Mens Cloaths, yet it becomes ſo generally worn both at home and abroad, that it is increaſed to a Manufacture by itſelf, and is more conſiderable than any ſingle Manufacture of Stuffs in the Nation. This imploys the Town of <hi>Newbury,</hi> as alſo <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> a Town I have already deſcribed, and many others in different Counties of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here lived the famous <hi>Jack of Newbury,</hi> the greateſt Clothier that ever was in <hi>England,</hi> having 100 Looms at work in his own Houſe. He flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and marched at the Head of 100 of his own Men, all cloath'd and maintain'd by himſelf, to the Battle of <hi>Flodden-Field,</hi> where he behav'd well. He rebuilt Part of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> Church, and the whole Tower of it. This is One of the Two Legatee Towns (as they were called) in the Will of the famous Mr. <hi>Kenrick,</hi> who being the Son of a Clothier of <hi>Newbury,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> left 4000<hi>l.</hi> to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and 7500<hi>l.</hi> to <hi>Reading,</hi> to encourage the Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade, and to ſet the Poor at Work, beſides other Gifts of extraordinary Value to the Poor.</p>

            <p>Near <hi>Newbury</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Craven</hi> built a very ſtately Pile of Buildings for his own Dwelling, called <hi>Spine</hi>; but as it was never quite finiſhed, ſo I do not underſtand, that his Lordſhip ever came to live in it, and ſome Years ago it was by a ſudden Fire burnt down to the Ground. It was reported, that that Lord built this magnificent Palace, (for ſuch it really was) at a Time when he had Hopes of marrying Madame Royale, as ſhe was then called, <hi>viz.</hi> the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. who, then a Widow, lived under the Shadow of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coutt; but being fruſtrated in that View, the Earl went no farther in his Building. But his preſent Lordſhip has lately rebuilt this Houſe, and tho' not in ſo grand a manner as the former, it is very commodious.</p>
            <p>Weſtward, a little out of our Way, we viſited the Ruins of the Caſtle of <hi>Donnington,</hi> juſt mention'd, which was ſeated on the Brow of a high Hill, waſhed by the little River <hi>Lambourn,</hi> and had been the Seat of Sir <hi>Geoffrey Chaucer,</hi> Father of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry. They ſhew us a Place here, where, in his Days, as well as many Years ſince, even down to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſome of the Inhabitants now living, flouriſhed a great Oak, call'd <hi>Chaucer</hi>'s <hi>Oak,</hi> where they very gravely tell you he uſed to ſit and compoſe his Poems.</p>
            <p>We went forward to the Town of <hi>Lambourn,</hi> ſo called from the River which runs down and falls into the <hi>Kennet,</hi> near <hi>Thatcham.</hi> It is ſituate on the South-ſide of <hi>White-Horſe-Hill,</hi> and has a Market.

            <p>At <hi>Newbury</hi> we quitted the high Road, and being deſirous to ſee ſomething of the North of <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> we ſtruck up to <hi>Iſlip,</hi> which tho' but an inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able little Town, yet has a good weekly Market for Sheep.</p>
            <p>We paſſed North-eaſtward to <hi>Wantage,</hi> a Town of ſome Antiquity, pretty good and neat. It is noted for the Birth-place of the renowned King <hi>Alfred,</hi> and is watered by the <hi>Och.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Wantage</hi> we advanced into the fine and fertile Vale of <hi>White-Horſe,</hi> which extends almoſt from <hi>Farringdon</hi> to <hi>Abington,</hi> tho' not in a direct Line. Looking South from the Vale, we ſee a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0141100402:63"/>
Trench cut on the Side of a high green Hill, in the Shape of a Horſe, and not ill done. The Trench is about a Yard deep, and fill'd almoſt up with Chalk; ſo that at a Diſtance you ſee the exact Shape of a <hi>White-Horſe,</hi> ſo large as takes up near an Acre of Ground. From this Figure the Hill is called <hi>White-Horſe-Hill,</hi> and the Vale below takes alſo its Name. 'Tis ſaid to be done in order to commemorate a ſignal Victory; and ſome give it to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whoſe Device was, and ſtill is, a white Horſe. Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this Vale, lies <hi>Aſhbury,</hi> betwixt which and <hi>Wantage</hi> is a very large Camp on the Brow of a Hill: 'tis ſingle work'd, and of a quadrangular Form, which ſhews it a <hi>Roman</hi> Work.</p>
            <p>The neighbouring Pariſh to this <hi>White-Horſe</hi> have a Cuſtom annually at <hi>Midſummer,</hi> to go and weed it, in order to keep it in Shape and Colour; and when they have done their Work, they end the Day in Feaſting and Meriment.</p>
            <p>We arrived at <hi>Farringdon,</hi> noted for its pleaſant Situation on a Hill. It has a very good Market weekly, and is very neat and clean. In this Place may be ſeen the Ruins of a Caſtle, built by <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Reign. Here was alſo a Priory of <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Monks. The Church is large and handſome.</p>
            <p>From hence we went partly by the Foreſt to <hi>Abingdon,</hi> a handſome well-built Town, where the Aſſizes and Seſſions, and other publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the County, are generally held. Here is a ſtately Market-houſe, built on high Pillars, over which is a large Hall for the Aſſizes. The Town conſiſts of ſeveral well-paved Streets, which centre in an open and ſpacious Place, where the Corn-market is kept. They make great Quantities of Malt here, and ſend it up by Barges to <hi>London.</hi> Here is a good Free-School, and alſo a Charity-School.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0141100402:64"/>
The Corporation is governed by a Mayor, Two Bailiffs, and Nine Aldermen.</p>
            <p>It is an antient Town, and was famed for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes in the Time of the antient <hi>Britons.</hi> It was alſo famous for having ſeveral Synods held there, and for one of the nobleſt Abbeys in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, founded, as it is ſaid, by <hi>Heane,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Ciſſa,</hi> Father to King <hi>Ina. Henry</hi> I. was educated in this Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>We next came to <hi>Wallingford,</hi> called by the antient <hi>Britons Gwal Hen,</hi> i. e. <hi>Old Fort,</hi> a Place of great Figure, as well in their Days and of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> the laſt of whom deſtroyed it in 1006; but it was ſoon rebuilt, and eſteemed a Borough, in the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>'s Time. It has been defended by a ſtrong Caſtle, which has been long ſince demoliſh'd. It is ſtill a large well-built Town, has a good Market-place and Town-hall, where the Aſſizes have been ſometimes held, and a Quarter-ſeſſion for the Borough always. It has ſtill Two Churches ſtanding; but one was very much damaged in the Civil Wars, when Two others here were altogether deſtroyed. It has Two weekly Markets, and is govern'd by a Mayor, Burgeſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we croſs'd the <hi>Thames</hi> into <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and leaving <hi>Wathington,</hi> a little inconſiderable Market-town on the Left, we fell down thro' <hi>Netlebed</hi> (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Town of little Note) to <hi>Henley upon Thames,</hi> a very antient Town, the Name being deriv'd from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Hen-lley,</hi> i. e. <hi>Old Place.</hi> It was formerly part of the Eſtate of the Barons of <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> mentioned before. It is now a Corporation of great Account, govern'd by a Warden, Burgeſſes, and other Officers. It has a conſiderable Corn and Malt-market. The Inhabitants are moſtly Maltſters, Mealmen and Bargemen, who by carrying Corn and Timber to <hi>London,</hi> get a gainful Living, and inrich
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0141100402:65"/>
the Neighbourhood. It has a good Free Grammar School, and alſo a Charity School, liberally endow'd for teaching, cloathing, and apprenticing ſeveral poor Children. Here is alſo an Alms-houſe, but meanly endowed; for tho' there are not above Six or Seven Perſons in it, they have but Six-pence a-piece weekly for their Allowance.</p>
            <p>We return'd over a wooden Bridge, into <hi>Berkſhire</hi>; and as <hi>Thatcham, Woolhampton</hi> and <hi>Theal,</hi> which lie between <hi>Newbury</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> are at preſent noted only for being great Thoroughfare Towns, and full of Inns, we went no further back than <hi>Reading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reading</hi> is ſo called from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Rhedin,</hi> i. e. <hi>Fern,</hi> which formerly grew in great Quantity there. It is a very large and wealthy Town, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly built, the Inhabitants rich, and driving a very great Trade. The Town is ſituated on the River <hi>Kennet,</hi> but ſo near the <hi>Thames,</hi> that the largeſt Barges which they uſe, may come up to the Town Bridge, where they have Wharfs to load and unload them. Their chief Trade is by this Water-naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to and from <hi>London,</hi> tho' they have neceſſarily a great Trade into the Country, for the Conſumption of the Goods which they bring by their Barges from <hi>London,</hi> and particularly Coals, Salt, Grocery Wares, Tobacco, Oils, and all heavy Goods.</p>
            <p>They ſend from hence to <hi>London</hi> by theſe Barges, very great Quantities of Malt and Meal, and theſe are the Two principal Articles of their Loadings. Some of thoſe Barges are ſo large, that I was told, they bring a Thouſand, or Twelve hundred Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Malt at a time, which, according to the ordinary Computation of Tonnage in the Freight of other Veſſels, is from a Hundred to an Hundred and Twenty Ton, dead Weight.</p>
            <p>They alſo ſend very great Quantities of Timber from <hi>Reading</hi>; for <hi>Berkſhire</hi> being a well-wooded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0141100402:66"/>
County, and the River <hi>Thames</hi> a convenient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance for the Timber, they tranſport the largeſt and faireſt of the Timber to <hi>London,</hi> which is generally bought by the Shipwrights in the River for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Merchant-Ships. The like Trade of Timber is carried on at <hi>Henley</hi> above-mentioned, and at <hi>Maiden-head</hi>; of which in its Place.</p>
            <p>A large Manufacture of Sail-Cloth was ſet up in <hi>Reading</hi> by the late Sir <hi>Owen Buckingham,</hi> Lord-Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and many of the poor People were profitably imployed in it; but Sir <hi>Owen</hi> dying, and his Son being unhappily kill'd in a Duel a little while after, that Manufacture died alſo.</p>
            <p>Here is however ſtill a Remnant of the Woollen Manufacture, which was once carried on in it to a very conſiderable Degree; and this Town, as well as <hi>Newbury,</hi> has injoy'd the above-mentioned Legacies of Mr. <hi>Kenrick,</hi> to ſet the Poor at Work, and incourage the Clothing Trade; <hi>viz.</hi> 7500<hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s Continuator ſays, there were once 140 Maſter-Clothiers in this one Town; but now they are almoſt all gone. During the Civil Wars in <hi>England</hi> this Town was ſtrongly fortified, and the Remains of the Baſtions and other Works are ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>There are Three Churches built of Flint and ſquare Stones in the quincunx Faſhion, with tall Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſame. Here are alſo Two large Meeting-houſes, beſides that of the Quakers. <hi>Camden</hi> calls it a little City: it is ſaid to contain about 8000 People, including a little Hamlet at the Bridge over the <hi>Thames.</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was born in this Town.</p>
            <p>It was formerly noted for a very famous Abbey, and other Religious Foundations. The Abbey ſtood in a charming Situation, and large Ruins of it are ſtill viſible, built of Flint: the Walls which remain are about Eight Feet thick, tho' the Stone that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0141100402:67"/>
faced them is gone. What is left is ſo hard cemented, that the Labour in ſeparating them would not be anſwer'd by their Uſe. There are many Remnants of arch'd Vaults, a good Height above Ground, whereon ſtood, as may be preſum'd, the Hall, Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Abbey Gate-houſe is yet pretty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
            <p>This was built by King <hi>Henry</hi> I. on an old Abbey, formerly erected by a <hi>Saxon</hi> Lady. That Prince was buried in it, with his Queen; but their Monuments are loſt in the Ruins of the Place, and no-where to be found.</p>
            <p>There was a famous old Caſtle, long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed.</p>
            <p>The Empreſs <hi>Maud,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> I. was alſo buried here; but her Monument is loſt, as well as the others. It bore this Inſcription, as we are aſſur'd:

               <hi>Thus tranſlated:</hi>

                  <l>Illuſtrious in Deſcent, in Marriage more,</l>
                  <l>But nobleſt in her Offspring's Royal Pow'r,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The deceas'd Earl <hi>Cadogan,</hi> who was created Baron of <hi>Reading,</hi> by his late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. in 1716, built a fine large Houſe at <hi>Caverſham</hi> near <hi>Reading</hi>; which his Succeſſor the preſent Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogan</hi> thought fit to reduce to a ſmaller and more convenient Size, as leſs regarding the outward Glare of Magnificence, than Uſe and Convenience.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Reading,</hi> in the Year 1688, began the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Alarm that ſpread over the whole Kingdom (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame time) of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being coming to cut every body's Throats; which was carried from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0141100402:68"/>
Town to Town by Peoples Fears and Terrors, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the Menaces of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Detachment of Soldiers, who were beat out of <hi>Reading</hi> by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and prevented taking the Quarters they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at <hi>Maidenhead, Colebrook, Stanes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Conſternation of the People all over <hi>England</hi> on this Occaſion; for the terrible Story ſpread (like the Undulations of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Pond, when a flat Stone is caſt upon the Surface) all over the Kingdom, as I have ſaid, in one Day; for Fear gave Wings to the News: no Poſt could carry it as it flew from Town to Town; and ſtill every Meſſenger had Two Articles with him: 1. Not that ſuch and ſuch Towns <hi>were to be</hi> burnt and plundered by them; but that they <hi>were already</hi> burnt: And, 2. that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were at their Heels to do the like there. And the Service this Report did to the Cauſe of the Revolution, is hardly to be imagined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twyford</hi> is about Five Miles Eaſt of <hi>Reading,</hi> and is only noted, like <hi>Theale,</hi> and the other Towns beyond <hi>Reading,</hi> for its Number of Inns, for the Accommodations of Carriers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt beyond <hi>Theale,</hi> is <hi>Inglefield,</hi> where King <hi>Ethet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf</hi> routed the <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Reading</hi> I went to <hi>Great Marlow</hi> in <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamſhire,</hi> which, though not in the direct Road, yet lying on the Banks of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per enough to be ſpoken of, and is particularly worth Notice for ſeveral Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Town of very great Imbarkation on the <hi>Thames,</hi> not ſo much for Manufactures wrought here, (for the Trade of the Town is chiefly in <hi>Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>) but for Goods brought from the neighbouring Towns; a very great Quantity of Malt and Meal particularly being brought hither from <hi>High Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which is one of the greateſt Corn-markets on
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0141100402:69"/>
this Side of <hi>England,</hi> and lies on the Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Between <hi>High Wickham</hi> and <hi>Marlow</hi> is a little River called the <hi>Loddon,</hi> on which are a great many Corn-mills, and ſome Paper-mills: the firſt of theſe grind and dreſs the Wheat, and then the Meal is ſent to <hi>Marlow,</hi> and put on board the Barges for <hi>London</hi>; and the ſecond make great Quantities of ordinary Printing-paper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. On the <hi>Thames,</hi> juſt by the Side of this Town, tho' on the other Bank, are Three very remarkable Mills, called the <hi>Temple-Mills,</hi> or the <hi>Braſs-Mills,</hi> for making <hi>Biſham</hi> Abbey <hi>Battery Work,</hi> as they call it, <hi>viz.</hi> Braſs Kettles and Pans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all Sorts. And theſe Works were attended with no ſmall Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, 'till in the Year 1720. they made a Bubble of it, and then it ran the Fate of all the Bubbles at that time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Next to theſe are Two Mills which are both of an extraordinary Kind, one for making of Thim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, a Work which performs to Admiration; and another for preſſing of Oyl from Rape and Flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, both which turn to very good Account to the Proprietors.</p>
            <p>Hither is alſo brought down a vaſt Quantity of Beech Wood, which grows in <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully than in any other Part of <hi>England</hi>; and from whence the County itſelf derives its Name.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Biſham,</hi> over-againſt this Town, was formerly an Abbey, and the Remains of it are ſtill to be ſeen. The Eſtate belong'd once to the <hi>Knights Templars,</hi> and ſince came to the antient Family of <hi>Hobby,</hi> whereof Sir <hi>William Hobby,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> are noted in our Hiſtories, the latter as having been imploy'd by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the moſt important foreign Negotiations, as a learned Man, and great Antiquary. Their Monuments, with thoſe of their Ladies and Children, are in the little Church of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0141100402:70"/>
               <hi>Biſham,</hi> and well worth ſeeing. The Seat of the Family is now in <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi>; but hither they are generally all brought, when they die, to be buried with their Anceſtors.</p>

            <p>From hence we fell with the <hi>Thames</hi> into <hi>Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and ſo came into the <hi>London</hi> Road again. It is an antient Corporation under the Government of a High Steward, a Mayor, a Steward, and Ten Aldermen, out of which they annually elect Two Bridgmaſters to look after the large Timber-bridge which here croſſes the <hi>Thames,</hi> for the Repair of which the Town has Three Trees annually allow'd them out of <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt. The Mayor, for the Time being, is Clerk of the Market and Coroner, and he and the Mayor for the preceding Year, and the Steward, are Juſtices of the Peace: they chuſe yearly Two Mace-bearers. The Town is a large Thoroughfare, with many good Inns in it, and has a good Market weekly. It lies in Two Pariſhes, one Part of it is in <hi>Bray,</hi> famous of old for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Vicar to all Times, Changes, and Seaſons.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as you are out of <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> you ſee <hi>Cliefden</hi> on your Left, where <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> began a magnificent and delightful Palace, which the late Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> afterwards purchaſed of the Family, and finiſh'd; and now has the Honour to be the Summer Retreat of his Royal Highneſs <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0141100402:71"/>We came to <hi>Slough,</hi> a Village Five Miles Eaſt of <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> which conſiſts almoſt intirely of Inns. They ſeem to vie with one another, and 'tis wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how they all ſubſiſt; and eſpecially as they are oppoſed by the Two famous new ones of the <hi>Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Windmill,</hi> a little Way out of <hi>Slough,</hi> which are much more delightfully ſituated, and have better Accommodations.</p>
            <p>Here we left the Road, and turn'd to the Right, and ſoon arriv'd at <hi>Eton,</hi> where there is the fineſt School for Grammar Learning, that is in <hi>Britain,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Buildings, except the great School-room, are antient; the Chapel <hi>Gothick</hi>; but all has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, at a very great Expence, out of the College Stock, within theſe few Years, and a noble Library built for the Reception of Books.</p>
            <p>In the great Court a fine Statue is erected to the Honour of the Founder, by Dr. <hi>Godolphin,</hi> late Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and Provoſt of this College; and the Library has receiv'd ſeveral conſiderable Benefactions, particularly very lately, the fine Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>Richard Topham,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> formerly Keeper of the Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which was preſented to it, by the late excellent Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Reeves.</hi> And before that a Collection of Books, valu'd at 2000<hi>l.</hi> was left to it by Dr. <hi>Waddington,</hi> late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Chicheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gardens, which extend from the College down almoſt to the Bank of the <hi>Thames,</hi> are well planted and kept.</p>
            <p>This College was founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. a Prince munificent in his Gifts for the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning. Witneſs, beſides this noble Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that of <hi>King</hi>'s College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to which the Scholars of <hi>Eton</hi> are annually removed; and which, had it been perfected as he deſigned it, would have been the nobleſt Building of the Kind in the

But his Succeſſor and Depoſer, K. <hi>Ed.</hi> IV. took ſeveral Manors from <hi>Eton</hi> College, and beſtow'd them on their Neighbours at <hi>Windſor</hi>; and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have taken from them ſtill more, had not the celebrated <hi>Jane Shore</hi> ſolicited in their Behalf.</p>
            <p>This College has a ſettled Revenue of about 5000<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and maintains a Provoſt, a Vice-provoſt, who is alſo a Fellow; Six other Fellows, and 70 Scholars on the Foundation, beſides a full Choir for the Chapel, with neceſſary Officers and Servants. The School is divided into the upper and lower, and each into Three Claſſes; each School has One Maſter, and each Maſter Four Aſſiſtants or Uſhers. None are received into the upper School, till they can make <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes, and have a tolerable Knowledge of the <hi>Greek.</hi> In the lower School the Children are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very young, and are initiated into all School-learning. Beſides the Seventy Scholars upon the Foundation, there are always abundance of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, generally ſpeaking, of the beſt Families, and of Perſons of Diſtinction, who are boarded in the Houſes of the Townſmen, and within the College.</p>
            <p>The Number of Scholars inſtructed here uſed to be from 400 to 500; but has not been, for Seven Years paſt, more than 320.</p>
            <p>The Election of Scholars for the Univerſity, out of this School, is made annually on the Firſt <hi>Tueſday</hi> in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> In order to it, Three Perſons are deputed from <hi>King</hi>'s College in <hi>Cambridge, viz.</hi> the Provoſt of that College, and One Senior, and One Junior Poſer, Fellows of the ſame; who being join'd by the Provoſt, the Vice-provoſt, and the Head Maſter of <hi>Eton</hi> College, call before them the Scholars of the upper Claſs, and examining them in the ſeveral Parts of their Learning, chuſe out Twelve ſuch as they think beſt qualified, and enter them in a Roll or Liſt for the Univerſity. Theſe Youths are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately removed from the School, but muſt wait till
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0141100402:73"/>
Vacancies fall in <hi>King</hi>'s College; and as ſuch happen, are then taken as they ſtand in Seniority in the Roll of Election.</p>
            <p>When a Scholar from <hi>Eton</hi> comes to <hi>King</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, he is received upon the Foundation, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues his Studies there for Three Years; after which he claims a Fellowſhip, unleſs forfeited by Marriage, accepting of Eccleſiaſtick Preferments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Terms of the Statutes.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt has a noble Houſe and Garden, beſides the Uſe of the College Gardens at his Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Will you, Sir, excuſe me here a few Lines to the Memory of the late excellent Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Reeves,</hi> before-mentioned? This worthy and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lawyer had a Seat in this Town, to which he conſtantly retired at the Cloſe of every Term, while he was at the Bar; for he would never go the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, or attend the Court of Chancery; and actually declined accepting of the high Office of a Judge, while his Lady liv'd, chuſing rather to ſpend his Vacations in Retirement with his Family, than either Honour or Profit; yet he was purſued even here with Caſes for his Opinion, as being the greateſt Lawyer of his Time; and theſe were conveyed to him by his Clerk from his Chambers in the <hi>Temple</hi>; and after he had anſwer'd them, he would return them thither again, without ſeeing the Practiſers who left them.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman lay a long time undiſtinguiſh'd in his Profeſſion, under an invincible Modeſty; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he thought once of quitting the Bar: but a lucky Occaſion happening, whereby he had an Opportunity to ſhew his great Parts and Learning, he was ſoon taken Notice of, and retain'd in every Cauſe of Moment; but however confined himſelf intirely to the Courts of Law, and chiefly to that of the King's Bench. After the Death of his Wife he was prevailed with to aſcend the Bench as a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0141100402:74"/>
Judge, in the laſt Court, which he accepted, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to alleviate and divert the Concern he was in for her Death. He was afterwards made Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common-pleas, in which Office he lived but Two Years. His Death was a publick Loſs, and much lamented.</p>
            <p>I am now come to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where I muſt for a while quit the Subject of Trade and Navigation, in order to deſcribe the moſt beautiful and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſituated Caſtle, and Royal Palace, in the whole Iſle of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> was the firſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchs, who diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Windſor.</hi> That Prince, who delighted much in Hunting, finding it a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion highly proper for that Purpoſe, and, as he ſaid of it, a ſuitable Place for the Entertainment of Kings, agreed with the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for an Exchange, and ſo took Poſſeſſion of it. He built a Caſtle here, and had ſeveral little Lodges or Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes in the Foreſt adjoining; and frequently lodg'd, for the Conveniency of his Sport, in a Houſe which the Monks before enjoyed near or in the Town of <hi>Windſor</hi>; for the Town is much more ancient than the preſent Caſtle, and was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Paſs upon the <hi>Thames</hi> in the Reign of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>After him King <hi>Edward</hi> III. taking an extreme Liking to that Place, reſolved to fix his Summer Reſidence here; and accordingly laid out himſelf the Plan of that magnificent Palace, which, as to outward Form and Building, we now ſee there; for whatever has been done as to beautifying, altering, or amending the Inſide and Apartments, nothing has been added to the Building itſelf, except that noble Terrace, which runs under the North Front, and leads to the Green on the Park, at the Eaſt Side or End of it, along which the fine Lodgings, and Royal Apartments, were at firſt built; all the North-part
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0141100402:75"/>
being then taken up in Rooms of State, and Halls for publick Balls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe itſelf was indeed a Palace, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Appearance of a Fortification; but when the Building was brought on to the Slope of the Hill on the Town Side, the King added Ditches, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, the Round Tower, and ſeveral other Places of Strength; and thence it was called a Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Such a Pride did this great King take in being the Founder of this ſumptuous Building, that when it was ſuggeſted to him, that <hi>William of Wickham</hi> had aſſumed the Honour of it to himſelf, it had like to have coſt <hi>William</hi> all his Intereſt in the King's Favour, which at that time was very great; but the Prelate cleared himſelf by diſavowing the Charge, urging that all he protended to, was to acknowlege, That the Money and the Reputation he had gained by building that Caſtle for the King, had been the making of him. For it ſeems he had cauſed theſe Words,
<q>THIS MADE WICKHAM,</q>
to be cut in Stone in the inner Wall of the little Tower, which from him is, to this Day, call'd <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William of Wickham,</hi> whom I have before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my Account of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was, at that time, the Architect of the Court; and ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Part, that in all the Decorations and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments which have been made ſince by ſucceeding Princes, they have found no Occaſion to add to or diminiſh any thing, except it be to alter ſome ſmall Matter at the Entrance to the great Stair-caſe, the Kitchen, and Offices below Stairs, and ſuch-like; but the great North and Eaſt Fronts, the Square of the inner Court, the great Gates at the entering from the Town, with the Round Tower, and the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0141100402:76"/>
Walls annex'd, are all ſtanding in the very Form in which King <hi>Edward</hi> III. left them.</p>
            <p>The only Addition in the Inſide, is a fine Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian Statue of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. which ſtands over the great Well, ſunk, as may be ſuppoſed, in the firſt Building, for the Supply of the Caſtle with Water, and in which was an Engine for raiſing it, notwithſtanding the great Depth, by very little Labour; the Contrivance and Performance of Sir <hi>Samuel Morland,</hi> an excellent Mechanick and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician.</p>
            <p>On the Outſide, as I have ſaid, was added the Terrace Walk, by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where ſhe uſually walked for an Hour every Day before her Dinner, if not hindered by windy Weather, to which ſhe had a peculiar Averſion; for ſhe loved to walk in a mild, calm Rain, with an Umbrella over her Head.</p>
            <p>This is really a magnificent Work; for as it is raiſed on a ſteep Declivity of the Hill, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily cut down a very great Depth, to bring the Foundation to a Flat equal to the Breadth, which was to be formed above. From the Foundation it was raiſed by ſolid Stone Work of a vaſt Thickneſs, with croſs Walls of Stone, for banding the Front, and preventing any Thruſt from the Weight of Earth within.</p>
            <p>This noble Walk is covered with fine Gravel, and has Cavities, with Drains, to carry off the Water; ſo that not a Drop of Rain will reſt on the Terrace, but it is dry, hard, and fit to walk on immediately after the greateſt Showers. The Breadth of this Walk is very ſpacious on the North Side; on the Eaſt Side it is narrower. Neither <hi>Verſailles,</hi> nor any of the Royal Palaces in <hi>France, Naples,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> can ſhew any thing like this. The Grand Seignior's Terrace, in the outer Court of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> next the Sea, is what I think comes the neareſt, and yet is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0141100402:77"/>
not equal to it, if I may believe the Account of thoſe who have ſeen it.</p>
            <p>At the North-eaſt Corner of this Terrace, where it turns South, to run on by the Eaſt Side of the Caſtle, are Steps, by which you go off upon the Plain of the Park, which is kept ſmooth as a Carpet, and on the Edge of which the Proſpect of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race is doubled by a Viſta, South over the Park, and quite up to the great Park, and towards the Foreſt. Here alſo is a ſmall Seat, that will not contain above One, or Two at moſt, with an high Back and Cover for the Head, which being fixed on a Pin of Iron or Braſs, the Perſons who ſit in it may eaſily turn it from the Wind, however it may blow; and enjoy a complete Calm. This is ſaid alſo to be Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s Invention, to avoid being ruffled with the Wind; and it affords no leſs Shelter from the Sun.</p>
            <p>From this lofty Terrace the People within have an Egreſs to the Park, and to a moſt beautiful Walk, which neither King <hi>Edward</hi> III. nor his Succeſſors, for ſome Hundreds of Years, knew any thing of, all their Proſpect being from the Windows of the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>On that Side of the Building which looks out upon the Terrace, are all the Royal Apartments; thoſe of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. which were on the Eaſt Side, being now allotted to great Officers of State.</p>
            <p>You mount into the Royal Apartments by ſeveral back Stairs; but the publick Way is up a ſmall Aſcent to a Flat or Half-pace, where there are two Entries of State by two large Stair-caſes, one on the Left-hand to the Royal Apartments, and the other on the Right, to <hi>St. George's-hall</hi> and the Royal Chapel.</p>
            <p>Before the Entrance to theſe on either Side, you paſs thro' the Guard-chambers, where you ſee the Walls furniſhed with Arms, and the King's Yeomen of the Guard keep their Station. Theſe Rooms
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0141100402:78"/>
lead as well to the fine Lodgings, as to <hi>St. George's-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Royal Lodgings there have been ſo many Alterations of Furniture, that there can be no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a particular Deſcription. In the Chimney-piece of one of theſe Apartments, is a Piece of Needle-work exquiſitely fine, performed, as they ſay, by the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> during the Time of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in <hi>Fotheringay-caſtle.</hi> There are ſeveral Family Pictures in the Chimney-pieces, and other Parts of thoſe Lodgings, which are very valuable.</p>
            <p>Theſe Rooms look all out North towards the Terrace, and over Part of the fineſt and richeſt Vale in the World; which along the Courſe of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> with very little Interruption, reaches to, and includes the City of <hi>London</hi> Eaſt, and the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> Weſt; the River, with a beautiful winding Stream gliding gently thro' the Middle of it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching by its Navigation both the Land and the People on every Side.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to ſay ſomething of the Beauties and Ornaments of <hi>St. George's-hall,</hi> tho' nothing can be ſaid equal to what the Eye may be Witneſs to. 'Tis ſurpriſing, at the firſt Entrance, to ſee at the Upper-end the Picture of King <hi>William</hi> on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; under him an Aſcent with Marble Steps, a Baluſtrade, and a half Pace, which formerly was actually there, with room for a Throne, or Chair of State, for the Sovereign to ſit on, when on publick Days he thought fit to appear in Ceremony.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt End of the Hall is the Chapel Royal, the neateſt and fineſt of the Kind in <hi>England:</hi> the carved Work is beyond any that can be ſeen in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>After we had ſpent ſome Hours in viewing all that was curious on this Side, we came down to the Dungeon, or <hi>Round Tower,</hi> which goes up a long, but eaſy Aſcent of Steps, and is very high. Here we
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0141100402:79"/>
were obliged to deliver up our Swords, but no-where elſe: tho' here is nothing curious. The Governor or Conſtable's Lodgings are neatly furniſhed, but nowiſe extraordinary.</p>
            <p>From this Tower you ſee <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Cathedral at <hi>London</hi> very plainly.</p>
            <p>Coming down from hence we entered into the other Court, where is the great Chapel of the Garter, and the Houſe or College for the poor Knights, as they are called.</p>
            <p>I might go back here to the Hiſtory of the Order of the Garter, the Inſtitution of which by King <hi>Edward</hi> III. had its Original here: but this is done ſo fully in other Authors, that I ſhall only mention, That this Order was not founded on the Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Garter, as <hi>Polydere Virgil,</hi> the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and moſt erroneous Author that ever wrote of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, ridiculouſly aſſerts; but on that martial King's own Garter, which he gave as the Signal at the glorious Battle of <hi>Creſſi,</hi> as <hi>St. George</hi> was given for the Word of the Day. To comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate which, in Honour of his brave and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Son, and of thoſe Nobles and Gentlemen who ſhared with him in the Glory of that ever memorable Day, he inſtituted this Order. And here I can't forbear obſerving, (tho' intirely out of my way) how fond we have ever been in following Foreigners in moſt Things, even from the Coxcomb in Dreſs, up to the Hiſtorian; as is evident not only from this idle Story of the above-mentioned Author prevailing among u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The lower Court of the Caſtle, although not ſo diſtinguiſhed by Lodgings and Rooms of State, is nevertheleſs particularly glorious for the fine Chapel of the Order, a moſt beautiful and magnificent Work, and which ſhews the Greatneſs not only of the Court in thoſe Days, but the Spirit and Genius of the magnanimous Founder. The Chapel is not only fine within, but the Workmanſhip without is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; nothing ſo antient is to be ſeen ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>King's-College</hi> Chapel at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> built by <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and <hi>Henry</hi> VII.'s Chapel in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> are fine Buildings; but they are modern, compared to this, which was begun, as by the inſcribed Dates upon the Walls appears, in the Year 1337.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0141100402:81"/>The Coats of Arms, and the various Imagery and other Ornaments both inſide and outſide, not only of the King, but of ſeveral of the firſt Knights Companions, are wonderfully finiſhed, and the Work has ſtood out againſt the Injury of Time to Admiration.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, that King <hi>Edward</hi> owns this Chapel was begun by his Anceſtors, and ſome think it was by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. and that he himſelf was baptized in it, and there was a Caſtle built by <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> alſo: As to the Chapel, which was then called a Church, or a Convent, King <hi>Edward</hi> III. did not pull down the old Building in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; but he added all the Choir to the firſt Model, and ſeveral other proper Parts for the Purpoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as Houſes and handſome Apartments for the Canons, Dignitaries, and other Perſons belonging to the Church, which are generally ſituated on the North Side of the Square, out of Sight, or rather ſkreened from the common View by the Church itſelf; which Dwellings are notwithſtanding very good, and well accommodated for the Perſons who are Poſſeſſors of them; then the King finiſhed it in the Manner we now ſee it: As for the old Caſtle, the Building of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> the King pulled it down to the Foundation, forming a new Building according to the preſent Plan, and which ſtood, as above, to the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. without any Alteration.</p>
            <p>The Eſtabliſhment for this Chapel was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, by the Donation of divers Subjects, before it was ſet apart to be the Chapel of the Order: the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> in particular, as appears in <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>'s <hi>Monaſticon,</hi> gave near 3000 Acres of Land, 19 Manors, 170 Meſſuages and Tofts, and ſeveral Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſons of Churches, to it; which, with other Gifts afterwards, made the Revenue above 1000<hi>l.</hi> a Year in thoſe Days, which was a prodigious Sum, as Money went at that Time.</p>

But as to the Liſt of the preſent Knights, that being ſubject to Fluctuation, comes not within my Deſign in this Letter.</p>
            <p>Several Kings and Perſons of high Rank have been buried alſo in this Chapel, as <hi>Edward</hi> IV. and <hi>Charles</hi> I. Here alſo is the Family Burying-place of the Dukes of <hi>Beauford,</hi> who are a natural Branch of the Royal Family of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Ceremonies obſerved here in the Inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Knights, are ſo perfectly ſet down in Mr. <hi>Aſhmole</hi>'s Hiſtory of the <hi>Order of the Garter,</hi> that nothing can be ſaid but what muſt be a Copy from him.</p>
            <p>As the upper Court and Building are fronted with the fine Terrace, ſo the lower Court, where this beautiful Chapel ſtands, is incompaſſed with a very high Wall, which goes round the Weſt-end of the Court to the Gate; and looking South, leads into the Town, as the Gate of the upper Court looks likewiſe South-eaſt into the little Park.</p>
            <p>The Parks about <hi>Windſor</hi> are very agreeable and ſpacious: the little Park, as it is called, is above 3 Miles round, the great one 14, and the Foreſt above 30. The firſt is particular to the Court; the others are open for Riding, Hunting, and taking the Air, for any Gentlemen that pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Lodges in thoſe Parks may be called Palaces, were they not eclipſed by the Palace itſelf. They have been beautified by the noble Perſons to whom the Poſt of Rangers has been generally aſſigned, who, having been inriched by other Advancements, Honours, and profitable Imployments, thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much to lay out to adorn their Apartments,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0141100402:84"/>
in a Place wherein it was ſo much to their Honour, as well as Convenience to reſide: ſuch is the Lodge belonging once to Admiral <hi>Churchill,</hi> the Ducheſs of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>We left <hi>Windſor,</hi> and ſtruck again into the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Road at <hi>Colebrook,</hi> and paſſed over the Heath, and thro' the Town of <hi>Hounſlow, Brentford, Hamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,</hi> and <hi>Kenſington</hi> into <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>

            <head>LETTER II. CONTAINING A Deſcription of the City of <hi>LONDON,</hi> as taking in the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings circumjacent.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am now to deſcribe the City of LONDON, and Parts adjacent: a Work infinitely difficult to be perform'd in the narrow Compaſs of a Letter, ſince we ſee it ſo fully takes up Two large Volumes in <hi>Folio,</hi> which yet, if I may venture to give an Opinion of it, is very imperfectly executed, and has imploy'd ſince another very large one in <hi>Folio,</hi> written by Mr. <hi>W. Maitland,</hi> F. R. S. which has much more Merit than the Two Volumes, and contains many Things needful to be known by the Curious, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the Brevity to which our narrow Limits confine us.</p>
            <p>LONDON, as a City only, and as its Walls and Liberties line it out, might indeed be viewed in a ſmaller Compaſs, than what we propoſe to conſider it in; for when I ſpeak of <hi>London,</hi> in the modern
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0141100402:86"/>
Acceptation, I take in all that vaſt Maſs of Buildings reaching from <hi>Blackwall</hi> in the Eaſt, to <hi>Tothill-fields</hi> in the Weſt; and extended in an unequal Breadth from the Bridge or River in the South, to <hi>Iſlington</hi> North; and from <hi>Peterborough-houſe</hi> on the <hi>Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to <hi>Cavendiſh-ſquare</hi>; and all the new Buildings by and beyond <hi>Groſvenor</hi> and <hi>Hanover Squares</hi> to the <hi>Brentford</hi> Road one way, to the <hi>Acton</hi> Road another; a Prodigy of Buildings, that nothing in the World does, or ever did, ſurpaſs, except old <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Time, when the Walls of that City were 50 Miles in Compaſs, and the Number of Inhabitants 6,800,000 Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London,</hi> as to its Figure, muſt be owned to be very irregular, as it is ſtretch'd out in Buildings juſt at the Pleaſure of every Undertaker of them, and as the Convenience of the People directs, whether for Trade, or otherwiſe. This has given it a very confuſed Face, and made it uncompact and unequal, being properly neither long or broad, round or ſquare; whereas the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> was, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, round, with very few Irregularities in its Shape.</p>
            <p>One ſees <hi>London,</hi> including the Buildings on both Sides the Water, in ſome Places Three Miles broad, as from <hi>St. George</hi>'s in <hi>Southwark,</hi> to <hi>Shoreditch</hi> in <hi>Middleſex</hi>; or Two Miles, as from <hi>Peterborough-houſe</hi> to <hi>Montague-houſe</hi>; and in ſome Places not half a Mile, as in <hi>Wapping</hi>; and leſs in <hi>Rotherhith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee ſeveral Villages, formerly ſtanding, as it were, in the Country, and at a great Diſtance, now joined to the Streets by continued Buildings, and more making haſte to meet in the like manner; for Example,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Deptford:</hi> This Town was formerly reckoned at leaſt Two Miles from <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> and that over the Marſhes too, a Place unlikely ever to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; and yet now, by the Increaſe of Buildings in that Town itſelf, and the many Streets erected at
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0141100402:87"/>
               <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> and by the Docks and Building-yards on the River-ſide, which ſtand between both, the Town of <hi>Deptford,</hi> and the Streets of <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> are in a manner joined, and the Buildings daily increaſing; ſo that <hi>Deptford</hi> may be reckoned a Part of the great Maſs, and infinitely full of People alſo; and were the Town of <hi>Deptford</hi> now ſeparated, and rated by itſelf, I believe it contains more People, and ſtands upon more Ground than the City of <hi>Wells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Town of <hi>Iſlington,</hi> on the North-ſide of the City, is in like manner joined to the Streets of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> excepting one ſmall Field, and which is in itſelf ſo ſmall, that there is no Doubt but in a very few Years they will be intirely joined. And the ſame may be ſaid,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of <hi>Mile-end,</hi> on the Eaſt End of the Town.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Newington-butts,</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> reaches out her Hand North, and is ſo joining to <hi>Southwark,</hi> that it cannot now be properly called a Town by itſelf, but a kind of Suburb to the Borough; and if, as once was talk'd of, <hi>St. George's-fields</hi> ſhould be built into Squares and Streets, <hi>Newington, Lambeth,</hi> and the <hi>Borough,</hi> would make but one <hi>Southwark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is in a fair way to ſhake Hands with <hi>Chelſea,</hi> as <hi>St. Gyles</hi>'s is with <hi>Marybone</hi>; and <hi>Great Ruſſel-ſtreet</hi> by <hi>Montague-houſe,</hi> with <hi>Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-court,</hi> is very evident; and yet all theſe put together, may ſtill be called <hi>London:</hi> Whither will this City then extend, and where muſt a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation Line of it be placed?</p>
            <p>I have, as near as I could, cauſed a Meaſure to be taken of this mighty Body; and for the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of your Curioſity, I have here given as accurate a Deſcription of it, as I can do in ſo narrow a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or without drawing a Plan of the Places.</p>
            <p>As I am forced, in many Places, to take in ſome unbuilt Ground, ſo I have, on the other hand, been obliged to leave a great many whole Streets of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0141100402:88"/>
out of my Line: ſo that I have really not ſtretched my Calculations, to make it ſeem bigger than it is; nor is there any Occaſion for it.</p>

                           <p>Were it poſſible to reduce all theſe Buildings to a compact Situation, 'tis generally thought, that the whole Body ſo put together, allowing the neceſſary Ground, which they now imploy for the ſeveral Trades in the Out-parts, ſuch as the Building-yards by the River for Shipwrights, Tanners Yards, Dyers, Whitſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would take up 28 Miles in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, very compactly built.</p>
                           <p>The Gueſſes that are made at the Number of Inhabitants, have been variouſly formed; Mr. <hi>Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> above-mentioned (<hi>Anno</hi> 1739) computes, that within the Walls, and the Bars, as I may ſay, it contains 725, 903; but Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> famous for his Political Arithmetick, ſuppoſed the City, at his laſt Calculation, to contain a Million of People, and this he judges from the Number of Births and Burials; but he muſt take in a greater Compaſs than Mr. <hi>Maitland,</hi> to make up this Number; and according to this Rule, as well by what is well known of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0141100402:95"/>
Increaſe of the ſaid Births and Burials, as of the prodigious Increaſe of Buildings, it may be very reaſonable to conclude the preſent Number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>within the Circumference I have mentioned in my Line,</hi> to amount to about 1,500,000 Souls.</p>
                           <p>The Government of this great Maſs of Building, and of ſuch a vaſt collected Body of People, tho' it conſiſts of various Parts, is perhaps the beſt regulated that any City can pretend to; and of late Years it boaſts of ſeveral new Regulations, as to Beggars, Lights, Pavements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which turn out greatly to its Advantage.</p>
                           <p>The Government of the City of <hi>London</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and abſtractedly conſidered, is by the Lord-Mayor, Twenty-four Aldermen, Two Sheriffs, the Recorder, and Common Council; but the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of theſe is confined to that Part only which they call the City and its Liberties, which are mark'd out, except the <hi>Borough,</hi> by the Walls and the Bars, as they are called.</p>
                           <p>Beſides this, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> have a Right Preſidial in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and hold frequent Courts at <hi>St. Mary-hill</hi> in the <hi>Borough:</hi> they are alſo Conſervators of the Bridge, and the Bridge itſelf is their particular Juriſdiction.</p>
                           <p>Alſo the Lord Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is Conſervator of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> from <hi>Stanes</hi> Bridge in <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> to the River <hi>Medway</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and, as ſome inſiſt, up the <hi>Medway</hi> to <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Bridge.</p>
                           <p>The Government of the Out-parts is by Juſtices of the Peace, and by the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> who are likewiſe Sheriffs of <hi>Middleſex</hi>; and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is by a High-bailiff, conſtituted by the Dean and Chapter, to whom the Civil Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration is committed, and who preſides in Elections of Parliament for the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and returns the Candidates who are choſen.</p>

                           <head>I. <hi>I.</hi> A brief Account of what the City was before the Fire, and how improved when rebuilt, and within a few Years after it.</head>
                           <p>TAKE the City, and its adjacent Buildings, to ſtand as deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Stow,</hi> or by any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who wrote before the Fire of <hi>London</hi>; and the Difference between what it was then, and what it is now, may be obſerved thus:</p>
                           <p>Before the Fire of <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1666, the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings look'd as if they had been formed to make one general Bonfire, whenever any wicked Incendiaries ſhould think fit to attempt it; for the Streets were not only narrow, and the Houſes all built with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Lath, and Plaſter; but the Manner of the Building in thoſe Days, one Story projecting out beyond another, was ſuch, that in ſome narrow Streets the Houſes almoſt touch'd one another at the Top; inſomuch that it often happened, that if a Houſe was on Fire, the oppoſite Houſe was in more Danger, according as the Wind ſtood, than the Houſes adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on either Side.</p>
                           <p>And tho' by the new Buildings after the Fire much Ground was given up to inlarge the Streets, yet it is to be obſerved, that the old Houſes ſtood generally upon more Ground, were much larger upon the Flat,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0141100402:98"/>
and in many Places Gardens and large Yards about them, ſo that there are many more Houſes built than ſtood before on the ſame Ground. For Example:</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Swithen</hi>'s <hi>Alleys</hi> by the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> were all, before the Fire, taken up with one ſingle Merchant's Houſe, Mr. <hi>Swithen</hi> by Name; whereas, upon the ſame Ground where the Houſe ſtood, ſtand now about 22 or 24 Houſes, which belong to his Poſterity.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Copt-hall Court</hi> in <hi>Throgmorton-ſtreet</hi> was alſo, before the Fire, a ſingle Houſe, inhabited by a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant: likewiſe Three more Courts in the ſame Streets were ſingle Houſes, Two on the ſame Side of the Way, and one on the other.</p>
                           <p>The ſeveral Alleys behind <hi>St. Chriſtopher</hi>'s Church, now vulgarly called <hi>St. Chriſtopher's Church-yard,</hi> were likewiſe, before the Fire, one great Houſe, with Ware-houſes, in which Mr. <hi>Kendrick</hi> lived; whom I have mentioned in my Account of <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Newbury,</hi> and took up almoſt all the Ground, on which now a Street of Houſes is erected, called <hi>Prince's-ſtreet,</hi> going thro' into <hi>Loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>King's-Arms Yard</hi> in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet,</hi> now built into fine large Houſes, and inhabited by eminent Merchants, was, before the Fire, a Stable-yard for Horſes, and an Inn, which gave the Sign of the <hi>King's Arms.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I might give many more Inſtances; but theſe will account for what ſome aſſert; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſo many great Houſes were converted into Streets, Courts, Alleys and Buildings, that near 4000 Houſes ſtand on the Ground which the Fire left deſolate, more than ſtood on the ſame Ground before.</p>
                           <p>Another Increaſe of Buildings in the City, is to be taken from the Inhabitants in the unburnt Parts following the ſame Example, of pulling down great old Buildings, which took up large Tracks of Ground in ſome of the well inhabited Places, and building
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0141100402:99"/>
on the ſame Ground not only ſeveral Houſes, but even whole Streets of Houſes, which are ſince fully inhabited: For Example,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Crosby-ſquare,</hi> within <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> formerly the Houſe of Sir <hi>James Langham,</hi> Merchant.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Devonſhire-Square</hi> and <hi>Street,</hi> with ſeveral back Streets, and Paſſages into <hi>Petticoat-lane</hi> one Way, and <hi>Houndſditch</hi> another, all built on the Ground where the old Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> had an Houſe and Garden.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Bridgwater-ſquare,</hi> and ſeveral Streets adjoining, built on the Ground where the Earl of <hi>Bridgwater</hi> had a large Houſe and Garden in <hi>Barbican.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Billeter-ſquare,</hi> and ſeveral Paſſages adjoining, built upon the Grounds of one great Houſe, in which one Merchant only lived.</p>
                           <p>All thoſe Palaces of the Nobility, formerly make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt beautiful Range of Buildings fronting the <hi>Strand,</hi> with their Gardens reaching to the <hi>Thames,</hi> where they had their particular Water-gates and Stairs, have had the ſame Fate, ſuch as <hi>Eſſex, Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, Norfolk, Saliſbury, Worceſter, Exeter, Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and <hi>York</hi> Houſes; the Lord <hi>Brook</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> in the Place of which are now ſo many noble Streets and Houſes erected, as are in themſelves equal to a large City; all which extend from the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Northumberland-houſe, Somerſet-houſe</hi> and the <hi>Savoy</hi> only intervening; and the latter of theſe may be ſaid to be, not an Houſe, but a little Town, being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into innumerable Tenements and Apartments.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are prodigious Inlargements to the City, even upon that which I call inhabited Ground, and where infinite Numbers of People now live, more than lived upon the ſame Spot of Ground before.</p>
                           <p>Suoh was the State of <hi>London</hi> before the Fire in 1666, and ſo prodigious were the Improvements made in it, within the Courſe of a few Years after that Diſaſter. But what are theſe, compared to what has been done ſince within our own Memory? And this brings me to my ſecond Article,</p>

                           <head>II. Of the prodigious Increaſe of Buildings within our own Memory, down to the Year 1740.</head>
                           <p>NOT to enter on a particular Deſcription of the Buildings, I ſhall only take notice of the Places where ſuch Inlargements are made: As,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. All thoſe numberleſs Ranges of Building, called <hi>Spital-fields,</hi> reaching from <hi>Spital-yard</hi> at <hi>Northern Fallgate,</hi> and from <hi>Artillery-lane</hi> in <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet,</hi> with all the new Streets, beginning at <hi>Hoxton</hi> and the Back of <hi>Shoreditch</hi> Church North, and reaching to <hi>Brick-lane,</hi> and to the End of <hi>Hare-ſtreet,</hi> on the Way to <hi>Bethnal-green</hi> Eaſt; then ſloping away quite to <hi>Whitechapel</hi> Road South-eaſt, containing, as ſome People ſay, above 320 Acres of Ground, which are now cloſe built, and inhabited with an infinite Number of People.</p>
                           <p>The Lanes were deep, dirty and unfrequented; that Part now called <hi>Spitalfields-market</hi> was a Field of Graſs, with Cows feeding on it, ſince the Year 1670. The <hi>Old Artillery-ground</hi> (where the Parliament liſted their firſt Soldiers againſt the King) took up all thoſe long Streets leading out of <hi>Artillery-lane</hi> to <hi>Spital-yard Back gate,</hi> and ſo on to the End of <hi>Wheeler-ſtreet. Brick-lane,</hi> which is now a long well-paved Street, was a deep dirty Road, frequented chiefly by Carts fetching Bricks that way into <hi>Whitechapel</hi> from Brick-kilns in thoſe Fields, whence it had its Name.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. On the more Eaſtern Part the ſame Increaſe goes on in Proportion; namely, all <hi>Goodman's-fields,</hi> and the many Streets between <hi>Whitechapel</hi> and <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary-lane,</hi> all built ſince the Year 1678. <hi>Well-cloſe,</hi> now called <hi>Marine ſquare,</hi> all the hither or Weſt End of <hi>Ratcliff-highway,</hi> from the Corner of <hi>Gravel-lane</hi> to the Eaſt End of <hi>Eaſt Smithfield,</hi> was a Road over the Fields; likewiſe thoſe Buildings now called
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0141100402:101"/>
                              <hi>Virginia-ſtreet,</hi> and all the Streets on the Side of <hi>Ratcliff-highway</hi> to <hi>Gravel-lane</hi> above-named, which of late Years extends ſo far, that the End of <hi>Lime-houſe</hi> ſtands a Chance to be ſoon joined to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Poplar.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. To come to the North Side of the Town, and beginning at <hi>Shoreditch</hi> Weſt, and <hi>Hoxton ſquare,</hi> and <hi>Charles-ſquare</hi> adjoining, thoſe were all open Fields, from <hi>Agnes St. Clare,</hi> to <hi>Hoxton</hi> Town, till the Year 1689, or thereabout. <hi>Pitfield-ſtreet</hi> was a Bank, parting two Paſture-grounds, and <hi>Ask</hi>'s Hoſpital was another open Field. Farther Weſt the like Addition of Buildings begins at the Foot-way by the <hi>Peſt-houſe,</hi> and includes the <hi>French</hi> Hoſpital, <hi>Old-ſtreet</hi> Two Squares, and ſeveral Streets, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Brick-lane</hi> to <hi>Mount-mill</hi> and the Road to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and from that Road, ſtill Weſt, to <hi>Wood's-cloſe,</hi> and to <hi>St. John's</hi> and <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> all which Streets and Squares are built ſince the Years 1688 and 1689, and were before that, and ſome for a long Time after, open Fields or Gardens, and never built on till after that Time; and moreover, within theſe few Years, all thoſe open Grounds, called <hi>Bunhill-fields,</hi> adjoining to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Burying-ground, are now built upon, and are complete Streets of Houſes to the very Road, and generally well inhabited.</p>
                           <p>From hence we go on ſtill Weſt, and beginning at <hi>Gray's-Inn,</hi> and going on to thoſe formerly called <hi>Red-lion</hi> Fields, and <hi>Lamb's-conduit</hi> Fields, we ſee there prodigious Piles of Buildings; they begin at <hi>Gray's-Inn-Wall</hi> towards <hi>Red-lion-ſtreet,</hi> from whence, in a ſtrait Line, they go quite to <hi>Lamb's-conduit</hi> Fields North, including a great Range of Buildings reaching to <hi>Bedford-row</hi> and the <hi>Cockpit</hi> Eaſt, and including <hi>Red-lion-ſquare, Ormond-ſtreet, Great</hi> and <hi>Little Marlborough-ſtreets, Queen's-ſquare,</hi> and all the Streets between the Square and <hi>King's-gate</hi> in <hi>Holbourn.</hi> Theſe Piles are very great, and the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0141100402:102"/>
Houſes ſo magnificent and large, that abundance of Perſons of Quality are found among them.</p>
                           <p>Farther Weſt in the ſame Line is <hi>Southampton</hi> great Square, called <hi>Bloomsbury,</hi> with <hi>Kingſtreet</hi> on the Eaſt Side of it, and all the numberleſs Streets Weſt of the Square to the Market-place, and thro' Great <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet</hi> by <hi>Montagu-houſe</hi> quite into the <hi>Hampſtead</hi> Road; all which Buildings, except <hi>Southampton-houſe,</hi> and ſome of the Square, have been formed from the open Fields ſince the Time above-mentioned, and contain ſeveral Thouſands of Houſes.</p>
                           <p>The Increaſe of the Buildings in <hi>St. Gyles's</hi> and <hi>St. Martin's in the Fields,</hi> is really a kind of Prodigy; compriſing all the Buildings North of <hi>Long-acre,</hi> up to the <hi>Seven Dials</hi>; all the Streets from <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> and <hi>St. Martin's-lane,</hi> both North and Weſt, to the <hi>Hay-market</hi> and <hi>Scho,</hi> and from the <hi>Hay-market</hi> to <hi>St. James's-ſtreet</hi> incluſive, and to the Park-wall; then all the Buildings on the North Side of the Street, called <hi>Picadilly,</hi> and the Road to <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> and between that and the South Side of <hi>Tyburn</hi> Road, including <hi>Soho-ſquare, Golden-ſquare, Hanover-ſquare</hi>

to be mentioned here.

                           <p>THE EXCISE-OFFICE is kept in the <hi>Old Jewry,</hi> in a very large Houſe, formerly the Dwelling of Sir <hi>John Frederick,</hi> and afterwards of Sir <hi>John Hern,</hi> very conſiderable Merchants. In this one Office is managed an immenſe Weight of Buſineſs, and they have in Pay ſeveral Thouſands of Officers. The whole Kingdom is divided by them into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Diſtricts, and to every Diſtrict a Collector, a Superviſor, and a certain Number of Gaugers, called, by the Vulgar, <hi>Exciſe-men.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Under the Management of this Office are now brought not only the Exciſe upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, as formerly, but alſo the Duties on Malt and Candles, Hops, Soap, and Leather, Coffee, Tea, and Chocolate; all which we managed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Claſſes.</p>
                           <p>The Act lately paſſed againſt retailing ſpirituous Liquors in leſs Quantities than Two Gallons, which had become ſo pernicious a Trade, that the lower Claſs of People was almoſt wholly debauched and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0141100402:104"/>
enervated by it, has very much increaſed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as well as the Buſineſs, of this Office; for the Commiſſioners for what relates to this Matter, are a kind of abſolute Judges in the Caſes brought before them.</p>
                           <p>The POST-OFFICE is kept in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet</hi> in a large Houſe, formerly Sir <hi>Robert Viner</hi>'s, and is under an admirable Management. The <hi>Peny-poſt</hi> is a Branch of it, and a moſt uſeful Addition to Trade and Buſineſs; for by it Letters are delivered at the remoteſt Corners of the Town, almoſt as ſoon as they could be fent by a Meſſenger, and that from Four, Five, Six, to Eight times a Day, according as the Diſtance of the Place makes it practicable; inſomuch that you may ſend a Letter from <hi>Limehouſe</hi> in the Eaſt, to the fartheſt Part of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for a Peny, ſeveral times in the ſame Day; and to the neighbouring Villages, as <hi>Kenſington, Hamerſmith, Chiſwick,</hi> &amp;c. Weſtward; <hi>Newington, Iſlington, Kentiſh-town, Hampſtead, Holloway, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> &amp;c. Northward; to <hi>Newington-butts, Camber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> &amp;c. Southward; and <hi>Stepney, Poplar, Bow, Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Deptford, Greenwich,</hi> &amp;c. Eaſtward, once a Day.</p>
                           <p>Nor are you tied up to a ſingle Piece of Paper, as in the <hi>General Poſt-office</hi>; but any Packet under a Pound-weight goes at the ſame Price.</p>
                           <p>The CUSTOM-HOUSE comes next to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The <hi>Long Room</hi> is like an <hi>Exchange</hi> every Morning, and the Croud of People who appear there, and the Buſineſs they do, is not to be explained by Words. The whole Building is very convenient, but not like what it might or ought to have been; and moreover, the Quays thereabouts are ſo throng'd and crouded, that they are much too little for the Buſineſs continually carrying on there.</p>
                           <p>Between the Horſe-guards at <hi>Whitehall</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-croſs,</hi> at an huge Expence, but with very little Taſte, is ſeen the new-erected ADMIRALTY-OFFICE. This Office is, perhaps, of the moſt Importance of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0141100402:105"/>
any of the publick Parts of the Adminiſtration; the Royal Navy being the Sinews of our Strength.</p>
                           <p>The NAVY-OFFICE, a neat and convenient Building in <hi>Cruched-fryars,</hi> and the VICTUALLING-OFFICE on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> near <hi>Eaſt Smithfield,</hi> both which, had we room, deſerve a particular Deſcription, are but Branches of this Adminiſtration, and receive their Orders from hence; as do likewiſe the Docks and Yards theirs from the <hi>Navy-office:</hi> the Whole being carried on with the moſt exquiſite Order and Diſpatch. The <hi>Admiralty</hi> has been in Commiſſion ever ſince the Death of Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Commiſſioners ſo often change by Deaths or Removals, that it will be of very little Uſe to inſert them in a Work like this.</p>
                           <p>Tho' his MAJESTY reſides all the Winter at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, yet the Buſineſs of the Government is chiefly carried on at the <hi>Cockpit, Whitehall.</hi> Near which is lately finiſhed a magnificent Building, with a very grand Front looking to the Parade in <hi>St. James</hi>'s-<hi>park,</hi> for the TREASURY-OFFICE; and, it being a lofty Structure, over that is the OFFICE of the SECRETARIES OF STATE.</p>
                           <p>The OFFICE for the BOARD OF TRADE is held juſt by the Upper-end of the <hi>Privy-garden,</hi> adjoining to an old Gate at the Entrance of <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> which is now demoliſh'd. It is a large Houſe, and convenient for the Purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>At the Horſe-guards is a Building commodious enough, built as a Barrack for a large Detachment of the Horſe-guards, who keep Poſt here; over it are Offices belonging to the Judge-advocate for holding Councils of War for Trial of Deſerters and others, according to the Articles of War.</p>
                           <p>A new Office and Houſe is very lately erected, adjoining to the Horſe-guards, for the Paymaſter-general of the Army.</p>

It is a noble Structure; but I have not room for a particular Deſcription of it.</p>
                           <p>The EAST INDIA HOUSE, ſituated where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was that of Sir <hi>William Craven,</hi> was rebuilt in the Year 1726. It is very convenient within; but without makes not the Appearance that is worthy of the Company's Trade and Figure in the World, its Front being not extended enough. In the back Part towards <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> they have alſo Warehouſes, which were rebuilt in a very handſome manner, <hi>Anno</hi> 1725.</p>
                           <p>The AFRICAN COMPANY'S HOUSE is in the ſame Street; a convenient Houſe, which ſerves for all the Offices their Buſineſs requires.</p>
                           <p>The SOUTH-SEA HOUSE is ſituate in a large Spot of Ground between <hi>Broad-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Threadneedle-ſtreet.</hi> At firſt two large Houſes were taken in to form the whole Office; but, as they were ſtreighten'd for Room, and were obliged to ſummon their General Courts at <hi>Merchant Taylors-hall,</hi> hard by; ſo they have lately erected a new Building for the whole Buſineſs, which my Limits will not permit me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to deſcribe.</p>
                           <p>The YORK-BUILDINGS COMPANY has been ſtruggling for ſome Years paſt with the great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties into which it has been plunged by the Fatality attending ſome late Tranſactions, and I ſhall ſay no more of it here.</p>
                           <p>Here are alſo ſeveral great Offices for Societies of INSURERS, where almoſt all Hazards may be inſured.

                           <p>In the Two firſt, all Hazards by Sea of Ships and Goods, not Lives, are inſured; as alſo Houſes and Goods are inſured from Fire.</p>

                           <p>In all which Offices the <hi>Premio</hi> is ſo ſmall, and the Recovery, in caſe of Loſs, ſo eaſy and certain, that nothing can be ſhewn like it in the World.</p>
                           <p>There are alſo Offices of INSURANCE ON LIVES, the <hi>Union Fire-office</hi> in <hi>Gutter-lane,</hi> the <hi>Weſtminſter Fire-office,</hi> and others, which manage a great deal of Buſineſs in the ſame way.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0141100402:111"/>
begun at the <hi>Woolſtaple,</hi> near <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> and is to be carry'd to <hi>Stangate</hi> on the oppoſite Side. Great Powers are given by this Act to Commiſſioners to agree with Perſons who own Houſes and Lands on either Shore: and they intend to pull down whole Streets about <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> and <hi>Channing-row,</hi> beſides what they are to do on the <hi>Surry</hi> Side, for the more commodious Paſſage to it. In ſhort, if the Plan be purſued that is propoſed, it will be a very conſiderable Work: but yet, we muſt ſay, that the greateſt Part of the Expence would have been ſaved, had it been built where firſt propoſed; and as the Money is raiſed by Lotteries, which are always of pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to Trade, it had been perhaps as well, in the preſent Juncture of the publick Affairs, that the neareſt way had been followed: and I may preſume to intimate, that tho' the Horſe-ferry were to be rejected, yet <hi>Scotland-yard,</hi> which is a great Body of ruinous or decaying Buildings, and joins to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and to which the main Streets point, leading down from <hi>Pall-mall, Picadilly,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> would have been, in my humble Opinion, a preferable Situation. 'Tis certain it might have been effected there, not only with more Conveniency, but at an eaſy Expence to what now muſt be the Caſe; and there had been no need to have pulled down the Houſes of Tradeſmen, and others, which brought in tolerable Rents, by their Vicinity to <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and the Two Houſes of Parliament. Several Stone Piers are already erected in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and they are proceeding with one of the nobleſt Streets of Houſes, that are any where to be ſeen, fronting <hi>Palace-yard.</hi> And here we ſhall leave it for this time, chuſing rather to deſcribe <hi>what is,</hi> than what is <hi>deſigned to be</hi>; ſince the Time this Work will take up ſtill, may ſubject it to ſeveral Alterations, now not eaſy to be foreſeen.</p>

                           <p>But yet I cannot forbear particularly to mention one Beauty, becauſe it is an Honour to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that is the great Piazza in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> the nobleſt Square in <hi>Europe,</hi> for Grandeur of the Deſign, eſpecially with the Beauty of the Eaſt Front of that elegant Church, the only Piece the Moderns have yet produced, that can admit of a juſt Compariſon with the Works of Antiquity; where a majeſtick Simplicity commands the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Judicious.

                           <p n="4">4. <hi>St. Bartholomew</hi>'s Hoſpital adjoins to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Hoſpital.

This Hoſpital has received very great Additions of late Years, and they are going on building ſtill, and 'tis well if they do not overdo it; for they demoliſh their Houſes, and reduce their Eſtates by it, and leave it upon the Generoſity of future Benefactors to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what they are about.</p>
                           <p>This Hoſpital relieves about 600 Patients daily with Lodging, Diet, Phyſick, and Chirurgery.</p>

                           <p>Tho' this Hoſpital is ſaid to be for Incurables, it is not for ſuch as are abſolutely ſo; for the Founder uſed to ſay, That he would not have his Hoſpital made an Alms-houſe.</p>
                           <p>Over and above the 200,000<hi>l.</hi> left to this Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the Founder left as many Legacies, and other Diſpoſitions, as were computed to amount to near 150,000<hi>l.</hi> more.</p>

                           <p>They have a handſome Chapel built at the upper End of the Yard belonging to the Houſe, where they go to Prayers twice a Day, at Seven in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at Seven in the Evening.

                           <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1732, a Corporation was erected for the Relief of poor Officers Widows belonging to the Navy, which allots 45<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> to a Captain's Widow; 30<hi>l.</hi> to a Lieutenant's; and 20<hi>l.</hi> to the Widows of Boatſwains, Gunners, Carpenters, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, Surgeons, Second Maſter of a Yacht, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Naval Veſſel, warranted by the Navy-board; provided the annual Incomes of their Real and Perſonal Eſtates do not amount to the aforeſaid yearly Sums.

                           <p>We ſhall only further obſerve in general, That thoſe noble Foundations, added to the innumerable Alms-houſes which are to be ſeen in almoſt every Part of <hi>London,</hi> make it certain, that there is no City in the World can ſhew the like Number of Charities from private Hands, there being not leſs than Twenty thouſand People maintain'd of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, beſides the Charities of Schooling for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and beſides the Collections at the annual Feaſts of ſeveral Kinds, where Money is given for putting out Children Apprentices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a great Number of which owe their Riſe to the Period of Time included in 40 Years paſt; ſo that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have no Reaſon to boaſt, that there were greater Benefactions and Acts of Charity to the Poor given in their Days, than in our Proteſtant Times. And this is, indeed, one of the principal Reaſons for my making mention of it in this Place; for let any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Age be ſingled out, and let the Charities of this Age, for about 40 Years paſt, and the Sums of Money beſtowed by Proteſtants in this Nation on mere Acts of Charity to the Poor, not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gifts to the Church, be caſt up, it will appear they are greater by far, than can be found in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in any the like Number of Years, take the Time when we will.</p>

                           <p>We muſt obſerve in the firſt Place, That the Churches in <hi>London</hi> are rather convenient than fine, not adorn'd with Pomp and Pageantry, as in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries; but, like the true Proteſtant Plainneſs, have very little Ornament either within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                           <p>But the moſt famous of all the Churches in the City, and of all the Proteſtant Churches in the World, is the Cathedral of <hi>St. Paul</hi>; an Edifice exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautiful and magnificent, with fewer Faults than are to be found in any Building of the like Nature and Extent; tho' ſome, who would be thought to have Skill in Architecture, are pleaſed to ſay there are many, and particularly cenſure it for its Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' perhaps it would be found, that the Fault is in their not conſidering ſeparately the Beauty and Proportion of every Part, in order to enter into the Nature and Deſign of the whole Compoſition.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0141100402:121"/>The vaſt Extent of the horizontal Arch of the Cupola, which ſupports a Stone Lantern near 70 Feet high, may well account for the Strength of the Piers and Butments below: Eight of which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Whole of that prodigious Weight. And tho' common Obſervers aſſert, that thoſe Piers, as alſo the Piers of all the Arches within-ſide, are too thick and heavy, yet, whoever knows any thing of the Rules of Architecture, muſt allow them to be as ſlender as the Strictneſs of thoſe Rules would admit of; for the Thickneſs of each Pier is not one Third Part of the Void of each Arch. And as to the Piers which ſupport the Dome, they, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with thoſe that ſupport the Cupola of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> come out to be but one Third Part of the Bigneſs of the latter, the one meaſuring 240 Feet in Circumference, the other not quite 80; yet there is not a great deal of Difference in the Dimenſions and Weight of the Two Cupola's. For that of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s is conſiderably larger and higher in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Piers that ſupport it, and to the Body of the Church, than that of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s. Wherefore I may venture, upon the whole, to aſſert, that were we to compare every Part of the Two Buildings together, we ſhall find <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s to be much leſs liable to the Objection of being a heavy Pile, than <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s.</p>
                           <p>The chief Reaſon, as I imagine, why this Church is cenſur'd for Heavineſs, is, not that it is really ſo in itſelf, but appears ſo, compar'd with the <hi>Gothick</hi> Architecture, which is more familiar to ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than the other, and admits of an extravagant Airineſs and Lightneſs In that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0141100402:122"/>
Arch hath a fix'd Proportion to its Breadth; the Doors, Windows and their Ornaments are the ſame; the Intercolumniations and their Intablatures are all confin'd to certain Admeaſurement. But who ever found that Exactneſs obſerv'd in any <hi>Gothick</hi> Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture? It muſt be allowed there are Pieces of that Sort of Architecture, that, in the Whole, look very auguſt and venerable. Yet let any one view the vaſt Stone Buttreſſes round the Outſide of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey, and ſee what Confuſion of Lines, and Breaks they occaſion in the Perſpective, and they will then eaſily account for the Lightneſs of the Inſide of that Building; for they are thoſe Buttreſſes, which by extending ſo far out, ſupport the whole Structure, more than its Walls or Pillars. This I mention for the ſake of common Obſervers only; for to the Judicious it is altogether unneceſſary.</p>
                           <p>Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> had the Satisfaction to find the injudicious Reprovers of his Work confuted by the Approbation of the beſt Maſters in <hi>Europe,</hi> who allow'd, That the Church of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the moſt ſtupendous Structure in the World, only exceeds <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s with reſpect to the Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Dimenſions, its rich <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, the beautiful Marble, of which both its Outſide and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide intirely conſiſt, the latter in different Colours, its Statues, Paintings, Gildings, Altars, and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; Ornaments not allowed of in Proteſtant Churches.</p>
                           <p>Had the Inſide of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s been adorned in as profuſe and pompous a Manner as <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s, it would have attracted the Admiration of ſuperficial Criticks, ſo that they would never have been able to diſcover the Faults they now pretend to find; Faults which can only be attributed to the Plainneſs of its Materials. But to ſuch as are real Judges, the Harmony, Proportion and Beauty of Buildings are equally admirable, whether they be executed in plain
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0141100402:123"/>
Free-ſtone, or the moſt beautiful Marble; whether the Carvings or Mouldings be gilt or not; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes or Panels in the Walls be curiouſly painted, or only plaiſter'd.</p>
                           <p>In the Year 1707, the Houſe of Commons had it under Conſideration, whether the Cupola ſhould be cover'd with <note n="*" place="bottom">This is an authentick Account of the Matter.</note> Copper or Lead; and upon Inquiry into which was moſt expedient and leaſt expenſive, it appear'd, that the Covering of Lead would amount to about 170 Tons, and the Expence thereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Workmanſhip, was eſtimated at 2500<hi>l.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Copper Covering was computed at Eleven Tons, Three hundred, Three Quarters and odd Pounds, and the Expence was eſtimated at 3050<hi>l.</hi> Upon which the Houſe fixed upon a Copper Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>But when the Bill which had a Clauſe in it for that Purpoſe, went up to the Lords, their Lordſhips left out the Clauſe; upon which the Commons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Conference, alleging, that Copper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to any other Covering, as well in reſpect of Duration as Lightneſs; for that Lead being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to frequent Repairs, the neceſſary Scaffolding for that Purpoſe at any one time, would exceed the Difference of Charge between that and Copper: beſides, that frequent Scaffolding would very much prejudice the Building. But the Seſſions cloſing the ſame Day, put an End to the Affair, and there were no Conferences; tho' the preceding Reaſons were what the Commons intended to offer, if there had been one.</p>
                           <p>It very probably was upon this Occaſion, that Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> is ſaid to have declared his Opinion in the Houſe of Commons, when ſome Gentlemen doubted whether the Cupola would bear the Leaden Covering, that it was able to bear 7000 Tons more than what is now upon it, and that he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0141100402:124"/>
to raiſe a Spire of Stone upon the whole 100 Feet higher than the Croſs now ſtands.</p>
                           <p>The Expence of this magnificent Structure, as it was laid before the Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1711, including the Building of the Chapter-houſe near it, a neat and elegant Fabrick, purchaſing of Property, together with the Eſtimate of what was neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the whole, in which was concluded a Ring of Twelve Bells, not yet put up, nor caſt, as alſo the Furniture for the Choir, amounted to 810,380<hi>l.</hi> 4<hi>s.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe Things, that were not ſo eaſy for every one to know, we have thought it neceſſary to inlarge upon. Our Bounds will not permit us to ſay all that the Subject requires, and we would not dwell upon Points which every one knows, or may eaſily inform himſelf of by his own Obſervation, or from other Writers, in relation to this famous Structure.</p>
                           <p>But one thing it will be requiſite to obſerve further, which every one does not know, and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall mention.</p>
                           <p>This able Architect, Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren,</hi> at the firſt ſetting about the Church, would have had its Situation removed a little to the North, to ſtand juſt on the Spot of Ground which is taken up by <hi>Pater-noſter Row,</hi> and the Buildings on either Side; ſo that the North-ſide of the Church ſhould have ſtood open to <hi>Newgate-ſtreet,</hi> and the South-ſide to the Ground on which the Church now ſtands.</p>
                           <p>By this Situation, the Eaſt-end of the Church, would have looked directly down the main Street of the City, <hi>Cheapſide</hi>; and for the Weſt-end, <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> having been removed a little North, the main Street called <hi>Ludgate-ſtreet,</hi> and <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> would only have ſloped a little W. S. W. as they do now irregularly Two Ways, one within, and the other without the Gate, and all the Street beyond <hi>Fleet-Bridge</hi> would have received no Alteration at all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0141100402:125"/>By this Situation, the common Thorough-fare of the City would have been removed at a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtance from the Work, and we ſhould not then have been obliged to walk juſt under the very Wall, as we do now, which makes the Work appear out of all Perſpective, and is the chief Reaſon of the Objections I have mention'd, as to the outſide Appearance; whereas, had it been viewed at a little Diſtance, the Building would have been ſeen infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to more Advantage.</p>
                           <p>Had Sir <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> been allowed this Situation, he would then, alſo, have had more room for the Ornament of the Weſt-end, which, tho' a moſt beautiful Work, would have been much more ſo then, and he would have added a circular Piazza to it, after the Model of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> but much more magnificent, and an Obeliſk of Marble in the Centre of the Circle, exceeding any thing that the World can ſhew of its Kind, of modern Work.</p>
                           <p>But the Circumſtance of Things hindered this noble Deſign, and the City being almoſt rebuilt before he obtain'd an Order and Proviſion for laying the Foundation, he was preſcribed to the narrow Spot where it now ſtands, in which the Building, however magnificent in itſelf, ſtands with great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage as to the Proſpect of it. The Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of this were ſo apparent when the Church was finiſh'd, that Leave was at length, tho' not without Difficulty, obtain'd, to pull down one whole Row of Houſes on the North-ſide of the Body of the Church, to make Way for the noble Baluſtrade of caſt Iron, raiſed upon an handſome Stone Wall of above a Yard high, that ſurrounds the Church-yard; and, indeed, to admit Light into the Church, as well as to preſerve it from the Danger of Fire.</p>
                           <p>That admirable Architect met with no better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in a Plan which was one of the moſt beautiful
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0141100402:126"/>
that could enter the Mind of Man, and would have made this City the nobleſt on Earth: this I ſhall relate in the Words of a certain Author, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Fire of <hi>London</hi> furniſh'd the moſt perfect Occaſion that can ever happen in any City, to rebuild it with Pomp and Regularity. This Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> foreſaw, and, 'tis ſaid, offer'd a Scheme which would have made it the Wonder of the World. He propoſed to have laid out one large Street from <hi>Aldgate</hi> to <hi>Temple-Bar</hi>; in the middle of which was to have been a large Square capable of containing the new Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, with a proper Diſtance for the View all round; whereby that huge Building would not have been cooped up, as 'tis at preſent, in ſuch a manner, as no-where to be ſeen to Advantage at all; but would have had a long and ample Viſta at each End, to have reconcil'd it to a proper Point of View, and give it one great Benefit, which in all Probability, it muſt now want for ever. He far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propoſed to rebuild all the Pariſh-churches in ſuch a Manner, as to be ſeen at the End of every Viſta of Houſes, and diſperſed in ſuch Diſtances from each other, as to appear neither too thick, nor thin in Proſpect, and give a proper Heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the whole Bulk of the City, as it filled the Landſchape. Laſtly, he propoſed to build all the Houſes uniform, and ſupported on a Piazza, like that of <hi>Covent-Garden:</hi> and by the Water-ſide from the Bridge to the <hi>Temple,</hi> he had planned a long and broad Wharf, or Quay, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to have ranged all the Halls that belong to the ſeveral Companies of the City, with proper Ware-houſes for Merchants between, to vary the Edifices, and make it at once one of the moſt beautiful and moſt uſeful Ranges of Structure in the World. But the Hurry of Rebuilding, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0141100402:127"/>
the Diſputes of Property, prevented this glorious Scheme from taking Place."</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>When this great Man found he could not carry this Point, he propoſed what we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; but, as we have obſerv'd, with as little Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs as the above grand Scheme; private Property, on this Occaſion, as it does on moſt others, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the better both of publick Utility and publick Spirit.</p>
                           <p>The new Churches at <hi>Lime-houſe, Ratcliffe-highway, Spital-fields, Old-ſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Strand, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-ſtreet, Hanover-ſquare,</hi> the <hi>Horſe-ferry, Blooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> I can but juſt mention, tho' they deſerve to be taken notice of by Travellers. But the latter, I muſt obſerve, was the firſt Building, wherein was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a Portico after the Manner of the antient Temples. The Body of the Church is a maſterly Performance; but the placing, for a Weather-cock, the Statue of a Prince famous for good Senſe and Steadineſs, is an Abſurdity peculiar to the Church of <hi>Bloomſbury.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The new-built Steeples or Towers of <hi>St. Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>'s <hi>Weſtminſter, St. Michael</hi>'s <hi>Cornhill, St. Mary Aldermary, St. Sepulchre</hi>'s, <hi>St. Chriſtopher</hi>'s, <hi>St. Dunſtan</hi>'s in the Eaſt, <hi>St. Clement</hi>'s-<hi>Danes,</hi> and the new-built Churches of <hi>St. Mary Woolnoth, Biſhops-gate, St. Leonard Shoreditch, St. Catharine Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, St. Martin</hi>'s in the Fields, <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s, I can only mention.</p>
                           <p>Among the Beauties of <hi>London,</hi> muſt be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the admirable Church of <hi>St. Stephen Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi> the <hi>Temple-Church, Bow-Church, St. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s-<hi>Danes, St. Paul Covent-Garden</hi>; and that incomparable Piece called <hi>The Banqueting-houſe</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> now made uſe of as a Chapel. This was the Deſign of <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> as one Pavilion for that admirable Model he gave for a Palace. And if this Specimen has juſtly commanded the Admiration of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0141100402:128"/>
Mankind, what muſt the finiſh'd Piece have done! It is to be hoped <hi>Britain</hi> will one Day have the Glory to accompliſh it, according to this Plan, and then it will far exceed all the Palaces of the Univerſe. Here is Strength with Politeneſs, Ornament with Simplicity, and Beauty with Majeſty. It is without Diſpute one of the nobleſt Structures in the World. The Ceiling is an admirable fine Piece of Painting by <hi>Rubens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Abbey or Collegiate Church of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is a venerable old Pile of Building; but begins to appears with a new Face; for a Tower is actually finiſh'd at the Weſt-end, and another is about. The Beginning of a fine and coſtly Spire was alſo laid ſome time ago, near the Middle of the Edifice, which however is yet uncertain whether it will be proceeded on or not. The Weſt Window fronting theſe Towers is one of the moſt beautiful in Glaſs Painting that has been done of late Years; and the Window alſo fronting <hi>King-ſtreet,</hi> finiſh'd in the Deanry of the late Biſhop <hi>Atterbury,</hi> is one of the fineſt modern Performances of its kind.</p>
                           <p>We are alſo aſſur'd, that the Houſes adjoining to this venerable Building will be all pull'd down, and the Building left clear: an Action that will be as laudable when done, as it was ſcandalous when begun; the Effect of private Avarice, whereby that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pile is ſubjected to the Hazards of Fire, and other Accidents, whenever an idle Servant ſhall get in a ſottiſh, a careleſs, or ſleepy Fit.</p>
                           <p>But after all, this Building, tho' very expenſive, is far leſs elegant than ſeveral other <hi>Gothick</hi> Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. Its Outſide can never be made beautiful; and within, it is extravagantly out of Proportion, with regard to the Height and Breadth of the middle Nef and Side-Ayles. The high Altar withinſide is a noble Piece, and had a wonderful fine Effect from the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0141100402:129"/>
Weſt Door, before the Organ lately erected inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted its View.</p>
                           <p>The Towers at the Weſt-end, which I have juſt mention'd, as they ſtand ſo cloſe together, are not ſufficiently contracted in the carrying them up. The Four Pinacles have a very wretched Effect, when viewed in a diagonal Line. The Style of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo far as is intire new Work, is a ſort of Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, neither <hi>Gothick,</hi> nor any thing elſe. As ſo many beautiful Structures of this Kind are to be ſeen, it is amazing, that any Architect ſhould be above imitating them, when 'tis plain he cannot equal, much leſs excel them.</p>
                           <p>This Abbey is the Repoſitory of the deceas'd <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Kings and Nobility, and very fine Monuments are ſeen over the Graves of our antient Sovereigns: the Particulars are too long to enter into here.</p>

                           <p>THE Palace of <hi>St. James</hi>'s, tho' the Winter Receptacle of all the Pomp and Glory of this Kingdom, is really mean, in Compariſon of the glorious Court of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> The Splendor of the Nobility, the Wealth and Greatneſs of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, the Oeconomy of the Houſe, and the real Grandeur of the whole Royal Family, out-does all the Courts of <hi>Europe</hi>; and yet this Palace comes beneath thoſe of the moſt petty Princes in it; altho' there cannot be in the World a nobler Situation for a Royal Palace than <hi>Whitehall.</hi> And it is with ſome Concern, that we ſee ſo fine a Spot become a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to private Spirit, ſo much of it being given away to particular Families, as makes more remote than we might otherwiſe expect it to be, the Hope we might juſtly have entertained, of ſeeing a Palace built there, worthy of the Glory of our Monarchs.</p>
                           <p>Many Plans have been drawn for the rebuilding of this Palace; but the moſt celebrated Draughts are thoſe of <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> and may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>'s <hi>Vitruvius Britannicus,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kent</hi>'s Edition of <hi>Jones</hi>'s Works. The laſt of theſe, if executed, would, for Magnificence and Beauty, tranſcend even the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> if we are to form a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Plans given of that famous Edifice. But 'tis a Queſtion whether the Expence would not exceed that of <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> which coſt Forty Millions of <hi>Roman</hi> Crowns.</p>
                           <p>As the Court is now ſtated, all the Offices and Places for Buſineſs are ſcatter'd about, here and there.</p>
                           <p>The Parliament meets as they uſed to do, while the Court was at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the King's Old Palace; nor can it be ſaid but the Place is made
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0141100402:131"/>
tolerably convenient for them, and is ſtill more ſo of late Years than it uſed to be; for the <hi>Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts</hi> is intirely new-built, and made a noble Room; and other Conveniencies are added. The Houſe of Commons meet in the Chapel of the Palace at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> dedicated to St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and fitted for this Purpoſe by that admirable Architect Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Houſe of Lords is a venerable old Place, tho' it muſt be ſaid to be much ſtreightened in the ſeveral Avenues to it, and Rooms above it; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the matted Gallery, the Lobby, the back Ways the King goes to it, are very ſhort of the requiſite Dignity or Convenience of the Place, and of the Glory of a King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who there meets the Peers and Commons of his Realm, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtitute the moſt auguſt Aſſembly in the World.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> a very noble <hi>Gothick</hi> Building, in which are held the Courts of Juſtice, is ſaid to be the largeſt Room in the World: its Roof, which is the fineſt of its Kind that can be ſeen, is 100 Feet wide. And here is held the Coronation-Feaſt of the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi>; alſo the Courts of Chancery, King's Bench and Common Pleas; and above Stairs, that of the Exchequer. But it muſt be confeſs'd, that it makes no very advantageous Appearance without, reſembling at a Diſtance a great Barn, of 300 Feet long; within, it is filled with Bookſellers Shops, and thoſe of other Trades; tho' the Alteration lately made in the Chancery and King's Bench Courts, at the upper End of the Hall, and thoſe for the Common Pleas on the Right-hand of it, give it a much better Appearance than it had before.</p>
                           <p>Adjoining to the Hall are kept the numerous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices belonging to the Exchequer of <hi>England,</hi> ſome of them very dark and inconvenient; and ſuch as to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0141100402:132"/>
a Stranger would afford a no very remote Idea (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in ſome of the Avenues from Office to Office) of the diſmal Manſions to which Money-Tranſactions often are thought to bring the devoted Subjects of <hi>Plutus.</hi>

                              <hi>Ludgate</hi> is a Priſon for Debt, for Freemen of the City only.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Newgate</hi> is a Priſon for Criminals, both in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and for Debtors alſo for <hi>Middleſex,</hi> being the County Gaol.</p>

                              <hi>Moregate</hi> is alſo rebuilt, and is a very beautiful Gateway, the Arch being near Twenty Feet high, which was done to give room for the City Train'd-bands to go through to the Artillery Ground, where they muſter, and that they might march with their Pikes advanced; for then they had Pikemen in every Regiment, as well in the Army as in the Militia, which ſince that, is quite left off. This makes the Gate look a little out of Proportion, to thoſe who know not the Occaſion of it.</p>

                              <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> is the only Gate which is erected at the Extent of the City Liberties, and this was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by ſome needful Ceremonies, as at the Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any King or Queen of <hi>England,</hi> at which Time the Gates are ſhut.

                           <p>There was formerly another Gate belonging to the City of <hi>London,</hi> called the <hi>Poſtern-Gate</hi> at <hi>Tower-hill</hi>; but it being partly demoliſh'd by Time, it is now turned into private Buildings.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>There is alſo a great Market, or rather Fair for Horſes, in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> every <hi>Friday</hi> in the Afternoon, where very great Numbers of Horſes, and thoſe of the higheſt Price, are ſold weekly.</p>
                           <p>The Fleſh Markets are <hi>Leaden-hall, Honey-lane, Newgate, Clare, Shadwell, Southwark, Weſtminſter, Spitalfields, Whitechapel, Brook, Bloomsbury, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, St. James</hi>'s, <hi>Hungerford</hi>; and now lately the new Market, at <hi>Fleet-ditch:</hi> as alſo another, for which a Patent was granted, <hi>May</hi> 1740, to be held on <hi>Monday, Wedneſday,</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> weekly, at <hi>Brook-field</hi> by <hi>May-fair,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>St. George Hanover-ſquare,</hi> for Meat, Herbage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>At all theſe Markets, a Part is ſet by for a <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi> and a Part for an <hi>Herb-market</hi>; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, there are the following particular Fiſh and Herb-markets, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <p>The laſt Three are, without Doubt, the greateſt in the World of thoſe Kinds.—There are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Multitudes of Coal-merchants, who have Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wharfs, from the <hi>Hermitage</hi> one Way, to the <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferry</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> another, which may be deemed ſo many Markets, tho' not publick ones.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Markets are ſo conſiderable in themſelves, that they merit a larger and more particular Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than I have room for. I ſhall, however, briefly obſerve of them, That of the fifteen Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markets for Proviſions, Seven of them are of antient Standing; but the others are erected ſince the Increaſe of the City. The old ones are, <hi>Leaden-hall, White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chapel, Newgate-market, Southwark, Clare, St. James</hi>'s, and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; to which ſome add <hi>Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> and theſe are ſo conſiderable, have ſuch Numbers of Buyers, and ſuch an infinite Quantity of Proviſions of all Sorts, Fleſh, Fiſh, and Fowl, that eſpecially, with regard to <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> no City in the World can equal them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0141100402:141"/>The great Market called <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> (of which a certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador ſaid, There was as much Meat ſold in it in one Month, as would ſuffice all <hi>Spain</hi> for a Year) contains Three large Squares, every Square having ſeveral Outlets into divers Streets, and all into one another. The firſt, and chief, is called the <hi>Beef-market,</hi> which has two large Gates, one into <hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi> one into <hi>Grace-church-ſtreet</hi>; and two ſmaller, <hi>viz.</hi> one by a long paved Paſſage leading into <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> and one under a Gateway from the ſecond Square. In this Square, every <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> is kept a Market for raw Hides, tann'd Leather, and Shoemakers Tools; and in the Ware-houſes, up Stairs, on the Eaſt and South-ſides of the Square, is the great Market for <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bays.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Square is divided into two Oblongs: in the firſt is the Fiſh-market, and in the other, a Market for Country Higglers, who bring ſmall Things, as Pork, Butter, Eggs, Pigs, Rabbets, Fowls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the North Part of the Fiſh-market, the Place being too large for the Fiſhmongers Uſe, are the Stalls of the Town Butchers for Mutton and Veal, the beſt and largeſt of which, that <hi>England</hi> can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, are to be bought there; and the Eaſt Part is a Fleſh-market for Country Butchers.</p>
                           <p>The third and laſt Square, which is alſo very large, is divided into Three Parts: round the Circumference, is the Butter-market, with all the Sorts of Higglery Goods, as before: the South Part is the Poultry-market, and the Bacon-market; and the Centre is an Herb-market. And there have been, lately, ſtill more Conveniences and Additions made to this prodigious Market, which we have not room to particularize.</p>
                           <p>All the other Markets follow the ſame Method in proportion to the Room they have for it.</p>
                           <p>There are Two Corn-markets; <hi>viz. Bear-quay</hi> and <hi>Queenhith.</hi> To the firſt comes all the vaſt Quantity
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0141100402:142"/>
of Corn that is brought into the City by Sea, from the Counties which lie commodious for that Carriage; and here Corn may be ſaid not to be ſold by Cart-loads, or Horſe-loads, but by Ship-loads; and except the Corn-chambers and Magazines in <hi>Holland,</hi> when the Fleets come in from <hi>Dantzick</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the whole World cannot equal the Quantity bought and ſold here; for no Quantity can be wanted either for Home Conſumption, or for Foreign Exportation, but the Corn-factors, who are the Managers of this Market, are ready to ſupply it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Queenhith</hi> is chiefly for Malt; the Barley of which takes up the Ground of ſo many Hundred thouſand Acres of Land in the Counties of <hi>Surrey, Bucks, Berks, Oxford, Southampton,</hi> and <hi>Wilts,</hi> and is called Weſt Country Malt.</p>
                           <p>It is true, there is a very great Quantity of Malt, and of other Corn too, brought to ſome other Places on the River, and ſold there; <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Milford-lane,</hi> above the Bridge, and the <hi>Hermitage,</hi> below the Bridge; but this is but, in general, a Branch of the Trade of the other Places.</p>
                           <p>It muſt not be omitted, that <hi>Queenhith</hi> is alſo a very great Market for Meal, as well as Malt, and, perhaps, the greateſt in <hi>England.</hi>

                           <p>The Veſſels which bring this Malt and Meal to <hi>Queenhith,</hi> are worthy Obſervation. They are remarkable for the Length of the Veſſel, and the Burden they carry, and yet the little Water they draw; for ſome of thoſe Barges carry above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Quarters of Malt at a time, and yet do not draw Two Feet of Water; and a Thouſand Quarters of Malt muſt be granted to be, at leaſt, a Hundred Tons Burden; and ſome of theſe large Barges come as far as from <hi>Abington,</hi> which is about One hundred and Fifty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> if we meaſure by the River.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0141100402:143"/>The next Market, which is more than ordinary remarkable, is the Coal-market at <hi>Billinſgate.</hi> This is kept every Morning on the broad Place juſt at the Head of <hi>Billinſgate-dock,</hi> and the Place is called <hi>Room-land:</hi> from what old forgotten Original it has that Name, Hiſtory is ſilent. I need not, except for the ſake of Strangers, take Notice, that the City of <hi>London,</hi> and Parts adjacent, as alſo all the South of <hi>England,</hi> is ſupplied with Coals, called therefore <hi>Sea-coal,</hi> from <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tine,</hi> and from the Coaſt of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland.</hi> This Trade is ſo conſiderable, that it is eſteemed the great Nurſery of our Seamen. I ſhall have occaſion to ſay more of it in my Account of the Northern Parts of <hi>England.</hi> The Quantity of Coals, which, one Year with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are burnt and conſumed in and about this City, is ſuppoſed to be about 500,000 Chalders, every Chalder containing 36 Buſhels, and generally weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 3000 Weight.</p>
                           <p>Moſt of theſe Coals are bought and ſold on this little Spot of <hi>Room-land</hi>; and tho' ſometimes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in caſe of a War, or of contrary Winds, a Fleet of 500 to 700 Sail of Ships, comes up the River at a time, yet they never want a Market. The Brokers of theſe Coals, are called <hi>Crimps</hi>; the Veſſels they load their Ships with at <hi>Newcaſtle, Keels</hi>; and the Ships that bring them, <hi>Cats,</hi> and <hi>Hags,</hi> or <hi>Hag-boats, Fly-boats,</hi> and the like.</p>
                           <p>The Increaſe of this Conſumption of Coals is another Evidence of the great Increaſe of the City of <hi>London</hi>; for, within a few Years paſt, the Import of Coals was not, in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> ſo great by very near half.</p>
                           <p>It muſt be obſerved, that as the City of <hi>London</hi> occaſions the Conſumption of ſo great a Quantity of Corn and Coals, ſo the Meaſurement of them is under the Inſpection of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen; and for the Direction of it, there is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0141100402:144"/>
allowed a certain Number of Corn-meters, and Coal-meters, whoſe Places are for Life, and bring them in a very conſiderable Income.</p>
                           <p>They have abundance of poor Men imploy'd under them, who are alſo called Meters, and are or ought to be Freemen of the City.</p>
                           <p>This is, indeed, a kind of Tax, as well upon the Coals as Corn; but the Buyer is abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, by being aſcertained in his Meaſure; for the ſworn Meters are ſo placed between the Buyer and the Seller, and have ſo many Eyes upon them, (being beſides Men of Character) that there is hardly ever any room for Complaint on this Head.</p>

Several good Houſes, and even Streets, are lately built in its Neighbourhood.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>St. Paul's</hi> School, founded by Dr. <hi>Colet,</hi> Dean of <hi>St. Paul's,</hi> is a fair Foundation for 153 Boys, to be taught <hi>gratis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Merchant Taylors</hi> School was founded by Sir <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Founder of <hi>St. John's</hi> College, <hi>Oxon,</hi> for 100 Scholars to be taught <hi>gratis,</hi> 100 more for Half a Crown, and another 100 for Five Shillings a Quarter; and has 46 Fellowſhips eſtabliſhed in <hi>St. John's</hi> College, for Scholars elected from this School.</p>
                           <p>Another excellent School was founded at <hi>Mercers-chapel,</hi> by that Company.</p>

                           <p>As to the LIBRARIES, I can only mention 'em likewiſe in a curſory manner. Thoſe at <hi>Sion-college,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> and other Inns of Court, <hi>Caſtle-yard,</hi> near the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>King's,</hi> &amp;c. deſerve more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mention than we can give them. In <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs-ſtreet,</hi> near <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> an handſome Building was erected, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1727, by the late Dr. <hi>Daniel Williams,</hi> a Diſſenting Divine, for a publick Library for the Uſe of the Diſſenting Miniſters of <hi>London.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The valuable Collections, called the <hi>Cotton Library,</hi> is ſo well known, that we ſhall only mention the great Diſaſter that befel it in the Year 1730, when a Fire happened, not thro' Over-care, we may be ſure, which burnt and defaced a great Number of valuable Manuſcripts. But moſt happily it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and extinguiſhed, before it made ſo great a Deſtruction as was at firſt apprehended. The learned Keeper of this ineſtimable Treaſure, Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Trinity-college, Cambridge,</hi> whoſe Labours have done ſo much Honour to the Commonwealth of Learning, was the firſt, we are told, to expreſs to ſome of his Friends, who came to condole with him the <hi>publick</hi> Loſs, the great Joy he conceived that all his <hi>own Works</hi> had eſcaped the Ravages of that furious Element, which had been ſo little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant to many curious Pieces of Antiquity. I would ſtudiouſly avoid all ill-natur'd Inſinuations; but wiſh, that with all the Excellencies which adorn this learned Man's Character, the Age in which he lives might be able to hand down his Fame to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Times, free from that private Spirit and Narrowneſs of Mind, of which his Enemies accuſe him. If he deſerves not the Ill-will of ſuch, he

has to comfort himſelf, that Envy always purſues true Merit, and ſo may make himſelf eaſy: If he does, we will venture to ſay, that 'tis a Pity that any Man's liſting himſelf either on this or that Side, as to Party, ſhould ſhield him from deſerved Cenſure.</p>

                           <head>XIII. Of the Shipping in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and the Trade carry'd on by means of that noble River.</head>
                           <p>THE whole River from <hi>London-bridge</hi> to <hi>Black-wall,</hi> is one great Arſenal: nothing in the World can be like it. The great Building-yards at <hi>Schedam</hi> near <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> are ſaid to out-do them in the Number of Ships which are built there; and they tell us, that there are more Ships generally ſeen at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> than in the <hi>Thames.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I will not ſay, but that there may be more Veſſels built at <hi>Schedam,</hi> and the Parts adjacent, than in the River <hi>Thames</hi>; but then it muſt be obſerved,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> build for themſelves princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, the <hi>Dutch</hi> for all the World,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That almoſt all the Ships the <hi>Dutch</hi> have, are built there, whereas not one fifth Part of our Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is built in the <hi>Thames</hi>; but abundance of Ships are built at the Sea-ports in <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as, at <hi>Newcaſtle, Sunderland, Stockton, Whitby, Hull, Gainsborough, Grimsby, Lynn, Liverpole, Yarmouth, Alborough, Walderſwick, Ipſwich</hi> and <hi>Harwich,</hi> upon the Eaſt Coaſt; and at <hi>Shoreham, Arundel, Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmſton, Portſmouth, Southampton, Pool, Weymouth, Dartmouth, Plymouth,</hi> beſides other Places, on the South Coaſt.</p>

                              <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0141100402:147"/>3. That we ſee more Veſſels in leſs Room at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>; but ſetting aſide their Hoys, Bilanders, and Schouts, which are in great Numbers always there, being Veſſels peculiar to their Inland and Coaſting Navigation, you do not ſee more Ships, nor near ſo many Ships of Force at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as at <hi>London.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That Part of the River <hi>Thames</hi> which is properly the Harbour, and where the Ships uſually deliver or unload their Cargoes, is called the <hi>Pool,</hi> and begins at the Turning of the River out of <hi>Limehouſe Reach,</hi> and extends to the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Quays: In this Compaſs I have had the Curioſity to count the Ships as well as I could, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> and have found about 2000 Sail of all Sorts, not reckoning Barges, Lighters or Pleaſure-boats, and Yachts; but of Veſſels that really go to Sea.</p>
                           <p>It is true, the River or <hi>Pool</hi> ſeemed at that time to be pretty full of Ships; as alſo that I included the Ships which lay in <hi>Deptford</hi> and <hi>Blackwall</hi> Reaches, and in the Wet Docks; but then I did not include the Men of War at the King's-yard, and in the Wet Dock at <hi>Deptford,</hi> which were not a few.</p>

                           <head>XIV. Of the Manner by which the City is ſupply'd with Water.</head>
                           <p>NO City in the World is ſo well furniſhed with Water as <hi>London,</hi> for their neceſſary Occaſions there, as well as for the extinguiſhing of Fires, when they happen.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. By the great Convenience of Water, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every-where laid in the Streets in large Timber Pipes, as well from the <hi>Thames</hi> as the <hi>New River,</hi> thoſe Pipes are furniſhed with a Fire Plug, of which the Pariſh Officers have the Key; and when opened, let out not a Pipe, but, as one may ſay, a River of Water into the Streets; ſo that making but a Dam in the Chanel, the whole Street is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under Water to ſupply the Engines.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. By the great Number of admirable Engines, of which almoſt every Pariſh has one, and ſome Halls alſo, and ſeveral private Citizens, have them of their own; ſo that no ſooner does a Fire break out, but the Houſe is ſurrounded with Engines, and a Flood of Water poured upon it, till it is extinguiſhed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The ſeveral Inſurance Offices, of which I have ſpoken in Article III. have each of them a certain Set of Men, whom they keep in conſtant Pay, and furniſh with Tools proper for their Work, and to whom they give Jack Caps of Leather, able to keep them from Hurt, if Brick or Timber, or any thing not of too great a Bulk, ſhould fall upon them. Theſe Men, whom they call <hi>Firemen,</hi> make it their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0141100402:149"/>
Buſineſs to be ready at Call, all Hours, to aſſiſt in caſe of Fire; and it muſt be acknowledged, they are very dexterous, bold, diligent and ſucceſsful.</p>
                           <p>There are two great Engines for the raiſing the <hi>Thames</hi> Water, one at the Bridge, and the other near <hi>Broken-wharf</hi>; and theſe raiſe ſo great a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, that 'tis ſaid, they are able to ſupply every Houſe throughout the whole City, with a running Pipe of Water up to the uppermoſt Story.</p>
                           <p>However, the <hi>New River,</hi> which is brought by an artificial Stream from <hi>Ware,</hi> continues to ſupply the greater Part of the City; and that with more Eaſe than the <hi>Thames</hi> Engines. Of this River I ſhall take farther Notice in my Deſcription of <hi>Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where it takes its Riſe.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Chelſea Water-works,</hi> as they are called, are alſo of no ſmall Uſe for the new Buildings at that End of the Town; and a noble Cut, being a large, tho' not long River of itſelf, from the <hi>Thames</hi> to near <hi>Buckingham</hi> Garden-wall, and a great Reſervoir of Water, in <hi>Hyde-park,</hi> produced by the ſame Undertaking, are no ſmall Additions to the great Convenience we are ſpeaking of, for the Parts which they reſpectively ſerve.</p>
                           <p>Formerly there were ſeveral beautiful Conduits in <hi>London,</hi> the Water of which was very ſweet and good, and brought to them at a vaſt Expence from ſeveral diſtant Springs in large Leaden Pipes: ſome of theſe were rebuilt ſince the Fire; but now the City is ſo well ſupplied with Water, that they are either quite demoliſh'd, or intirely out of Uſe. That in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> was pull'd down but very lately, and a Statue propoſed to be built in its Place, in Honour to the great King <hi>William</hi> III. and it muſt be own'd, that it is one of the moſt commodious Places for ſuch a Purpoſe in the whole City. But it being ſet on Foot, as ſome thought, by Party on one Side,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0141100402:150"/>
was rejected, from far leſs laudable Motives, by Party on the other.</p>
                           <p>It is a well known Fact, that the bringing the <hi>New River</hi> to <hi>Iſlington,</hi> for the Benefit of the City, was the Ruin of the firſt Attempter Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Society of the <hi>Temple</hi> neglected to lay in Water till the Year 1737, when a terrible Fire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in it, which burnt down ſeveral Houſes, and the <hi>Middle Temple</hi> Kitchen among the reſt, that Society agreed with the <hi>New River Water</hi> Company, and there are nowfine Conveniencies built for that Purpoſe in every Court and open Place, which are only to be uncovered on occaſion of ſuch Accidents. This Fire happened <hi>Jan.</hi> 3. 1736-7, and in it was conſumed one of the moſt valuable Collections of Antiquity in <hi>England,</hi> belonging to <hi>James Weſt,</hi>

                           <p>There has formerly been a great Emulation between the <hi>Court-end</hi> of the Town, and the <hi>City</hi>; and it was ſeriouſly propoſed in a certain Reign, how the <hi>Court</hi> ſhould humble the <hi>City:</hi> nor was it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable Thing at that time, had the pernicious Scheme been carry'd on. Indeed it was carried fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than conſiſted with the Prudence of a good Government, or of a wiſe People: for the <hi>Court</hi> envy'd the <hi>City's</hi> Riches, and the Citizens were ever jealous of the <hi>Court's</hi> Deſigns. The moſt fatal Steps the <hi>Court</hi> took at that Time to humble the City, were, 1. The ſhutting up the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> And, 2. The bringing a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt their Charter. But theſe Things can but be touch'd at here. The <hi>City</hi> has outliv'd it all, and both the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts turned to the Diſcredit of the Party who puſhed them on. The <hi>City</hi> is indeed, and at all times muſt be, ſo neceſſary to the <hi>Court,</hi> that no prudent Adminiſtration will ever ſeek Occaſions for Miſunderſtandings with it: but will, if not infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, do all in its Power to incourage and increaſe the Opulence of the <hi>City,</hi> which upon any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency will be able and willing, if not diſobliged, to ſupport the <hi>Court,</hi> and furniſh Means to protect the Kingdom, againſt either Foreign or Domeſtick Enemies.</p>

            </p>
            <p>All theſe, though ſome of them are very large Villages, make up but one Pariſh, and are within a few Years ſo increaſed in Buildings, and ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, that there is no Compariſon to be made
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0141100402:156"/>
between their preſent and former State; every ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Hamlet being increaſed, and ſome of them more than trebly bigger than formerly they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hackney</hi> is ſo remarkable for the Retreat of wealthy Citizens, that there are at this time near an Hundred Coaches kept in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newington, Tottenham, Edmonton,</hi> and <hi>Enfield,</hi> ſtand all in a Line North from the City. The Increaſe of Buildings is ſo great in them all, that they ſeem to a Traveller to be one continu'd Street; eſpecially <hi>Tottenham</hi> and <hi>Edmonton</hi>; and in them all, the new Buildings ſo far exceed the old, eſpecially in their Value, and the Figure of the Inhabitants, that the Faſhion of the Town is quite altered.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Tottenham</hi> we ſee the Remains of an antient Building call'd the <hi>Croſs,</hi> from which the Town takes the Name of <hi>High-Croſs.</hi> Here is a ſmall, but pleaſant Seat of the Earl of <hi>Colerain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Highgate</hi> and <hi>Hamſtead</hi> are next on the North-ſide. At the firſt is a very beautiful Houſe built by the late Sir <hi>William Aſhurſt,</hi> on the very Summit of the Hill, and with a View from the very loweſt Windows over the whole Vale, to the City: and that ſo eminently, that they ſee the Ships paſſing up and down the River, for Twelve or Fifteen Miles below <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the County does not extend far this way, I take no notice of ſmaller Towns; nor is there any thing of Note but Citizens Houſes for ſeveral Miles; except the Chace, at <hi>Enfield,</hi> which was a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Place, when King <hi>James</hi> I. reſided at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> for the Pleaſure of his Hunting; and was then very full of Deer, and all ſorts of Game; but it has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſeveral Depredations ſince that, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Times of Uſurpation, when it was ſtript both of Game and Timber, and let out in Farms to Tenants for the Uſe of the Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0141100402:157"/>After the Reſtoration it was laid open again; Woods and Groves were every-where planted, and the whole Chace ſtored with Deer: but it is not, nor perhaps ever will be, what it was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hampſtead</hi> is riſen from a little Village, almoſt to a City; nor could the uneven Surface, inconvenient for Building, check the Humour of the Builders; for even on the very Steep of the Hill, where there's no walking Twenty Yards together, without tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, or ſtraddling down a Hill, the Buildings are increaſed to that Degree, that the Town almoſt ſpreads the whole Side of the Hill.</p>
            <p>The Heath extends about a Mile every way, and affords a moſt beautiful Proſpect; for we ſee here <hi>Hanſlop Steeple</hi> one way, which is within Eight Miles of <hi>Northampton,</hi> N. W. to <hi>Landown-hill</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> another way Eaſt, at leaſt Sixty-ſix Miles from one another. The Proſpect to <hi>London,</hi> and beyond it to <hi>Banſtead-downs,</hi> South; <hi>Shooters-hill,</hi> South-eaſt; <hi>Red-hill,</hi> South-weſt, and <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> Weſt, is alſo uninterrupted. Indeed, due North, we ſee no farther than to <hi>Barnet,</hi> which is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ove Six Miles from it.</p>
            <p>At the Foot of this Hill is an old Seat of the Earls of <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> called <hi>Bel-ſize</hi>; which for many Years had been neglected: but being tenanted by a certain <hi>Projector,</hi> who knew by what Handle to take the gay Part of the World, he made it a Houſe of Pleaſure and Entertainment: this brought a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Concourſe of People to the Place; and they were effectually gratified in all Sorts of Diverſion; but there being too great a Licence uſed, it alarm'd the Magiſtrates, and now the Houſe is haſtening apace to Ruin.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Long Room at <hi>Hampſtead,</hi> in which the Company meet publickly on a <hi>Monday</hi> Evening to play at Cards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Vipand,</hi> the Maſter of that, built in the Year 1735, a fine Aſſembly-room,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0141100402:158"/>
Sixty Feet long, and Thirty wide, elegantly deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; every one who does not ſubſcribe, pays half a Crown for Admittance. Every Gentleman who ſubſcribes a Guinea for the Seaſon, has a Ticket for himſelf, and for Two Ladies. Gentlemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who lodge in the Town, are entertain'd every <hi>Sunday</hi> for 6<hi>d.</hi> each, with Tea and Coffee; but no other Amuſements.</p>
            <p>I could not be at <hi>Hamſtead</hi> without making an Excurſion to <hi>Edgworth,</hi> a little Market-town, on the Road to <hi>St. Albans</hi>; for 'tis certain, that this was formerly the main Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s, being the famous high Road, call'd <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtreet,</hi> which reached from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and on towards <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near this Town, the Duke of <hi>Chandos</hi> has built one of the moſt magnificent Palaces in <hi>England,</hi> with a Profuſion of Expence, and ſo well furniſh'd within, that it has hardly its Equal in <hi>England.</hi> The Plaiſtering and Gilding are done by the famous <hi>Pargotti,</hi> an <hi>Italian.</hi> The great <hi>Salon</hi> or <hi>Hall</hi> is painted by <hi>Paolucci.</hi> The Pillars ſupporting the Building are all of Marble: the great Stair-caſe is extremely fine; and the Steps are all of Marble, every Step being of one whole Piece, about Twenty-two Feet in Length.</p>
            <p>The Avenue is ſpacious and majeſtick, and as it gives you the View of Two Fronts, join'd, as it were, in one, the Diſtance not admitting you to ſee the Angle, which is in the Centre; ſo you are agreeably drawn in, to think the Front of the Houſe almoſt twice as large as it is.</p>
            <p>And yet, when you come nearer, you are again ſurpriſed, by ſeeing the winding Paſſage opening, as it were, a new Front to the Eye, of near 120 Feet wide, which you had not ſeen before; ſo that you are loſt a while in looking near hand for what you ſo evidently ſaw a great way off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0141100402:159"/>The Gardens are well deſigned, and have a vaſt Variety, and the Canals are very large and noble.</p>
            <p>The Chapel is a Singularity, both in its Building, and the Beauty of its Workmanſhip; and the Duke uſed to maintain there a full Choir, and had the Worſhip perform'd with the beſt Muſick, after the manner of the Chapel Royal.</p>
            <p>Two Miles from hence, we go up a ſmaller Aſcent by the great Road; when leaving the Street Way on the Right, we enter a ſpacious Common called <hi>Buſhy-heath,</hi> where again we have a very agreeable Proſpect. On the Right-hand, we have in View the Town of <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s; and all the Spaces between, and further beyond it, look like a Garden. The incloſed Corn-fields make one grand Parterre: the thick-planted Hedge-rows ſeem like a Wilderneſs or Labyrinth; the Villages interſpers'd, look like ſo many ſeveral noble Seats of Gentlemen at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In a Word, it is all Nature, and yet looks like Art. On the Left-hand we ſee the Weſt-end of <hi>London, Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi> and the Parliament-Houſe; but the Body of the City is cut off by the Hill, at which <hi>Hampſtead</hi> intercepted the Sight on that Side. More to the South we have <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and S. W. <hi>Windſor,</hi> and between both, thoſe beautiful Parts of <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> on the Bank of the <hi>Thames,</hi> which are the moſt agreeable in the World. But I muſt travel no farther this Way, till I have taken a Journey Weſt from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſeen what the Country affords that Way.</p>
            <p>The next Towns adjacent to <hi>London,</hi> are <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington, Chelſea, Hamerſmith, Fulham, Brentford, Twickenham,</hi> &amp;c. all of them near, or adjoining to the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and which, by the Beauty of their Buildings, make good the North Shore of the River, anſwerable to what I have already deſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0141100402:160"/>But here I ought not to omit mentioning the new Bridge from <hi>Fulham</hi> to <hi>Putney,</hi> croſs the <hi>Thames,</hi> which is a handſome wooden Fabrick, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, by its many angular Indentings, for Foot-paſſengers, as for Horſes and Coaches. A Toll is paid for every one that paſſes it, let it be ever ſo often in a Day; and the Rate pretty much the ſame as the Ferry uſed to be. And as the Proprietors are ſaid to divide 10 or 12<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> from the Profits of it, 'tis pity, methinks, that Foot-paſſengers, who cannot wear the Bridge, ſhould pay at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kenſington</hi> cannot be nam'd without mentioning the King's Palace there: it was originally an old Houſe of the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi>'s, of whom the late King <hi>William</hi> bought it, and then inlarg'd it as we ſee; ſome of the old Building ſtill remaining in the Centre of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Houſe itſelf fronts to the Garden Three Ways, the Gardens being now made exceeding fine, and inlarged to ſuch a Degree, as to reach quite from the great Road in <hi>Kenſington</hi> Town, to the <hi>Action</hi> Road North, more than a Mile, beſides a great Track of Ground out of <hi>Hyde-Park.</hi> An artificial Mount is alſo erected, which affords a fine View, is planted with Ever-greens, and has a Seat upon it, which turns round with great Eaſe at Pleaſure. The noble River that is lately dug in <hi>Hyde-Park,</hi> affords a fine View from theſe beautiful Gardens. The firſt laying out of theſe Gardens was the Deſign of the late Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who finding the Air agreed with the King, reſolved to make it agreeable to herſelf too, and gave the firſt Orders for inlarging them.</p>
            <p>The late Queen <hi>Anne</hi> improv'd what Queen <hi>Mary</hi> began, and delighted very much in the Place; and often was pleaſed to make the Green-houſe, which is very beautiful, her Summer Supper-houſe.</p>
            <p>And her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Caroline</hi> completed the Whole, by the Additions juſt now mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0141100402:161"/>King <hi>William,</hi> Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> dy'd here.</p>
            <p>As this Palace opens to the Weſt, there are Two great Wings built, for receiving ſuch as neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend the Court, and a large Port-cocher at the Entrance, with a Poſtern, and a Stone Gallery, on the South-ſide of the Court, which leads to the great Stair-caſe.</p>
            <p>It is no Wonder, the Court being ſo much at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi> that the Town has increaſed in Buildings; and indeed it abounds with handſome Houſes, and has a very pretty Square.</p>
            <p>South of this Town ſtands <hi>Chelſea,</hi> at which Place is the nobleſt Building, and one of the beſt Foundations of its kind in the World, for maimed and old Soldiers, built by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here alſo are the Phyſick-gardens belonging to the Company of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> In it is lately built a ſtately and convenient Edifice, which ſerves at the ſame time for a Green-houſe, and Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments over it for meeting of the Company of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,</hi> &amp;c. and over them are very convenient Apartments, which may be uſed for drying Seeds of Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As this Ground was made a Preſent by Sir <hi>Hans Sloane,</hi> they have erected in the new Building, a Statue of that Gentleman; and intend to make, in due Time, an Opening down to the River, which will have a beautiful Effect upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> and receive no leſs Grace from it. On the Pedeſtal of this Statue is an Inſcription expreſſing the Company's Gratitude to Sir <hi>Hans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near the Royal Hoſpital was, till very lately, a neat and beautiful Houſe and Gardens built by the late Earl of <hi>Ranelagh</hi>; but they are now quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, being ſold out in Parcels to Builders, and other Purchaſers.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Walpole</hi> has a fine Houſe here, and good Gardens, adjoining to the Hoſpital, adorn'd with noble Pictures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0141100402:162"/>In ſhort there is an incredible Number of fine Houſes built in all theſe Towns within theſe few Years, which in other Places would paſs, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for Palaces; and moſt of the Poſſeſſors whereof keep Coaches.</p>
            <p>Among theſe are the late Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s at <hi>Parſons-Green</hi>; Lord <hi>Halifax</hi>'s at <hi>Buſhy-Park</hi>; Earl of <hi>Bradford</hi>'s, Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s, Earl of <hi>Shrewſbury</hi>'s, Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi>'s, <hi>Sutton-Court Chiſwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barker</hi>'s, Lord <hi>Wilmington</hi>'s, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Whetham</hi>'s, <hi>Holland-Houſe,</hi> near <hi>Kenſington,</hi> ſituated on a fine Eminence, and which now is taken by the Lord <hi>Bruce,</hi> who is making it once more a delightful Habitation; the late Secretary <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s, at <hi>Twickenham,</hi> and Multitudes of others.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not paſs over ſo ſlightly the noble Seat of the Right Hon. the Earl of <hi>Burlington,</hi> at <hi>Chiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>; and yet I can only mention curſorily ſome of its Beauties: as the River his Lordſhip has dug in his Gardens, a very fine one indeed; from the Earth of which he has formed a noble Mount next the Road, or rather a Terrace, from which the whole Country may be viewed, and which ſerves at the ſame time, for a Defence to his Gardens on that Side, and is planted to the Road with all manner of ſweet Shrubs, Roſes, Honeyſuckles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that yield in the Seaſon a delightful Fragrance, as well to the Paſſengers as to thoſe on the Terrace; the magnificent Buildings in Imitation of antient Temples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> interſperſed in the Gardens; the beautiful Bridge over the River in it; the fine Walks; the unbounded Proſpects; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral curious Statues, a noble Obeliſk, delicate Viſtas, and the ſumptuous Buildings adjoining to the old Houſe, commanding a fine View to the River; which, with the Pictures and valuable Curioſities withinſide, altogether exceed Deſcription.</p>
            <p>In the Village of <hi>Hamerſmith,</hi> which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a long ſcattering Place, full of Gardeners Grounds,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0141100402:163"/>
with here and there an old Houſe of ſome Bulk, we ſee now great Numbers of fine Houſes, and a continued Range of a great Length, which makes the main Street.</p>
            <p>I have now travers'd the beſt Part of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> a County made rich, pleaſant and populous, by the Neighbourhood of <hi>London.</hi> The Borders of the County have Three Market-towns, <hi>Stanes, Colbrook</hi> and <hi>Uxbridge:</hi> this laſt is a pleaſant large Town, full of good Inns, as the others are, and famous, in particular, for having abundance of fine Seats of Gentlemen, and Perſons of Quality, in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; and alſo for a vain Attempt made in the great Civil War, to ſettle the Peace of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a Treaty here.

where a new Church is juſt finiſh'd; and others all crouded and ſurrounded with fine Houſes, or rather Palaces, of the Nobility, Quality and Gentry of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are but Three more Market-towns in the County, <hi>viz. Brentford,</hi> the County-town, <hi>Edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and <hi>Enfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I enter the County of <hi>Hertford,</hi> a fruitful Soil, as it is managed; for 'tis certain, it is more indebted, for its Fertility, to the Sagacity and Induſtry of the Huſbandman, than to Nature. Rich Meadows are ſeldom found here; for it affords not any large Rivers: the Arable hath generally too much Gravel, or too much Clay; but theſe laſt cold
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0141100402:164"/>
and wet Lands have been within theſe Forty Years greatly improv'd by draining off the Rain-water, which ſtagnated on the clayey Surface, as in a Cup, and chilled the Roots of the Corn; an Invention, called <hi>Buſh-draining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The County is well-water'd for the Conveniency of the Inhabitants; tho' the <hi>Lea</hi> is the only navigable Stream in it, which has its Riſe in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi>; of which more anon. But this County aſſumes the Honour of giving Riſe unto ſeveral Rivers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pariſh of <hi>Tring</hi> to the <hi>Thames,</hi> which leaving the County at <hi>Putenham,</hi> goes by <hi>Ayleſhury</hi> to <hi>Thame,</hi> and thence by <hi>Wheatley-bridge</hi> to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Iſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The County may be divided into Three Parts pretty equal, by Two great Roads, one Part lying between the North Road, which goes thro' <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> &amp;c. and the Borders of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire</hi> North, and thoſe of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Eaſt. Another Part lying between that Road and the other, which leads thro' <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s to <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Cheſter</hi>; and the third lying between this laſt Road, and the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Middleſex</hi> South, and thoſe of <hi>Bucks</hi> Weſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the laſt at <hi>Eaſt-Barnet,</hi> a Thoroughfare-town of Note, and well ſupplied with Inns: it lies high and pleaſant, and was formerly frequented for its medicinal Waters, and now for its Swine-market. It has in its Neighbourhood ſeveral very handſome Houſes of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and which are the more pleaſant by being ſo near the Chace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Totteridge</hi> is near it alſo, and is a very pleaſant Village. It is ſituated on a fine Eminence looking to the North, over the <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s Road into the Foreſt; and on the South over the <hi>Edgware</hi> Road, to <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> &amp;c. It is very clean, and has ſeveral very good Houſes in it. The Road from <hi>Hampſtead</hi> here is extremely pleaſant, and ſo well repaired, that in the worſt Seaſon there is ſcarce any Water or Dirt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0141100402:165"/>
remaining in it; and as it lies not on any great Road, there are no heavy Carriages paſſing that Way; therefore a ſmall Expence annually, well laid out, will always keep this Road in excellent Repair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheaping-Barnet</hi> lies a little North, in the <hi>St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>'s Road, and is remarkable for the deciſive Battle fought there on <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> 1468, between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> in which the great Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> ſtyled <hi>Make-king,</hi> was killed, with many of the prime Nobility, and 10,000 Men. The Place ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the Field of Battle, is a green Spot near <hi>Kicks-End,</hi> between <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s and <hi>Hatfield</hi> Roads, a little before they meet. The Manor is in the Property of the Duke of <hi>Chandois.</hi> A handſome Row of Six Alms-houſes, for ſo many Widows, founded by <hi>James Ravenſcroft,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in 1672, with a little Furniture to each, is in the Street. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> built a Free School-houſe of Brick in the ſame Street, where Nine Children are taught <hi>gratis,</hi> and all other Boys at Five Shillings the Quarter.</p>
            <p>About Two Miles N. W. from hence, on the Left-hand, lies <hi>Durhams,</hi> formerly the Seat of the <hi>Auſtins,</hi> but is now the Property of the Earl of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> who purchaſed it of Sir <hi>John Auſtin,</hi> and has ſince greatly beautified the Seat, by laying moſt of the neighbouring Fields belonging to the Eſtate, into a Park, and turning and repairing of the Roads. The Houſe ſtands on an Eminence, ſituated in a ſmall Valley, ſurrounded with pretty high Hills at a little Diſtance, ſo that in the Summer Months it is an agreeable Retirement: but the Soil all round it being a ſtrong Clay, all the Rain which falls in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being detained on the Surface, renders the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very cold and moiſt. Add to this the Want of good Water, and Timber near the Houſe, (except the young Trees which have been planted by his Lordſhip) and upon the Whole it cannot be eſteemed a good Seat.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Idleſtrey</hi> or <hi>Elſtre</hi> is a Village on the <hi>Roman Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtreet,</hi> on the very Edge of <hi>Middleſex</hi>; but it is chiefly noted for its Situation, near <hi>Brockly-Hill,</hi> by <hi>Stanmore,</hi> which affords a lovely View croſs <hi>Middleſex,</hi> over the <hi>Thames,</hi> into <hi>Surrey.</hi> Near this is <hi>Kendale</hi> Wood, where formerly was found an old Flint Wall, ſo hard as not to yield to the Strokes of the Pick-ax; as likewiſe an Oven. Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> digging his Canal and Foundations for his Buildings, upon the Spot of the old City, <hi>Suellaniacis,</hi> found many Coins, Urns, and other Antiquities. They have a Proverb here, relating to the Antiquities:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>No Heart can think, nor Tongue can tell,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>What lies 'tween</hi> Brockley-Hill <hi>and</hi> Pennywel.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pennywel</hi> is a Parcel of Cloſes acroſs the Valley beyond <hi>Brockley-Hill,</hi> where Foundations are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, and where, they ſay, has been a City.</p>
            <p>About Two Miles further Weſt lies <hi>Watford,</hi> a Market-town, Seventeen Miles from <hi>London,</hi> upon the <hi>Colne,</hi> where it hath Two Streams, which run ſeparately to <hi>Rickmerſworth.</hi> Several Alms-houſes belong to this Town, and an handſome Free-ſchool, built in 1704, and finiſh'd 1709, by <hi>Elizabeth Fuller,</hi> Widow; and in the Church are ſeveral handſome Monuments. The Town is very long, having but one Street, which is the publick, and ſo is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dirty in Winter; and the Waters of the River, at the Entrance of the Town, are often ſo much ſwelled by Floods, as to be unpaſſable; and the Bridge deſigned as the Road at ſuch times, is ſo much out of Repair, that it is very dangerous for any Carriages of Burthen to paſs over it; which is a very great Diſadvantage to the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſſioberry,</hi> the Seat of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> is the next thing that occurs worth notice, and is elegant. The Situation is the beſt in the County, upon a dry Spot, within a Park of a large Extent: the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0141100402:167"/>
Houſe is built in Form of an H: the Middle and the Eaſt Wing is modern, and in good Repair; but the Weſt Wing is very old, and by no means cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with the other Parts of the Houſe. The Front faces the South-eaſt, and looks directly on the Houſe in <hi>Moore-Park,</hi> on which the late Mr. <hi>Stiles</hi> expended ſuch great Sums of Money, and which has a noble Look from <hi>Caſſioberry</hi> Houſe. In the Front of the Houſe is a fine dry Lawn of Graſs, which immediately after the heavieſt Winter Rains may be rode or walked on, as on the drieſt Downs; and a little below the Houſe is a River, which winds through the Park, and in the drieſt Seaſons conſtantly runs with a fine Stream, affording great Plenty of Trout, Cray-fiſh, and indeed moſt other kinds of freſh-water Fiſh. On the North and Eaſt Sides of the Houſe are large Wood-walks, which were planted by the famous <hi>Le Notre,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> II. The Woods have many large Beech and Oak-trees in them; but the principal Walks are planted with Lime-trees, and theſe are moſt of them too narrow for their Length, and too regular for the modern Taſte. On the other Side of the River, the Ground riſes to a conſiderable Height, which affords an agreeable Variety; part of which being covered with ſtately Woods, appearing at a proper Diſtance from the Front of the Houſe, have a fine Effect to the Eye. In ſhort, the whole Spot (if a ſmall Expence was beſtow'd to improve and put it more in the modern Taſte) would be one of the fineſt Places near <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near <hi>Caſſioberry</hi> is a pleaſant Seat, purchaſed by the late Lord <hi>Raymond,</hi> called <hi>Langleybury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rickmerſworth</hi> is a Market-town, within Three or Four Miles Weſt of <hi>Watford.</hi> It gave Birth to Sir <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Merchant-Taylor of <hi>London,</hi> who founded <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Hall, and <hi>St. John</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0141100402:168"/>
in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Here are Two Alms-houſes, one for Four, the other for Five Widows.</p>
            <p>We viſited in this Neighbourhood <hi>More-Park,</hi> with a fine Houſe in it, of the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> ſtanding upon the Side of the Hill, facing <hi>Caſſioberry,</hi> on the other Side the River. It has been allowed one of the beſt Pieces of Brick-work in <hi>England.</hi> Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> commends the Garden as one of the beſt laid-out in <hi>England.</hi> The Ducheſs of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> on whom it was ſettled by Marriage, ſold it in 1720, to <hi>Benjamin-Heſkins Stiles,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who has made it a magnificent Edifice, having built a South Front of Stone with Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades, by which an Opening is made thro' the Hill that once obſtructed its View toward <hi>Uxbridge.</hi> A North Front is alſo erected, and the Hill towards <hi>Watford</hi> cut thro' for a Viſta. The Inſide of the Houſe is alſo adorned with admirable Work of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In digging this Hill, Veins of Sea-ſand with Muſcles in it were found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abbots-Langley,</hi> Twenty-two Miles from <hi>London,</hi> ſituated about Three Miles North of <hi>Caſſioberry,</hi> in a good Air and Soil, is remarkable for the Birth of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pope, <hi>Nicolas Brakeſpear,</hi> by the Title of <hi>Adrian</hi> IV. The Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> held his Stirrup, while he diſmounted. He was choaked, as ſome ſay, by a Fiſh, and, as others, by a Quinſy: but it is an indelible Stain on his Memory, that, when ſovereign Pontiff, he ſuffer'd his Mother to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Alms of the Church of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We proceeded to <hi>Kings-Langley,</hi> ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Henry</hi> III. built himſelf a Royal Houſe here, of which the Ruins ſtill exiſt: and here was born and buried <hi>Edmund de Langley,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Fifth Son of <hi>Edward</hi> III. and his Wife <hi>Iſabel,</hi> youngeſt Daughter of Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was alſo buried here, and the Tomb is in the Church of this Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0141100402:169"/>We next went to <hi>Hempſted,</hi> a little further North, and about Twenty-three Miles from <hi>London,</hi> a Baili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Corporate Town. It has the greateſt Corn-market in the County, or perhaps in <hi>England</hi>; in which 20,000<hi>l.</hi> a Week are frequently returned for Meal only. Eleven Pair of Mills ſtand within Four Miles of the Place, which bring a great Trade to it: but the Road is by this means ſo continually torn, that it is one of the worſt Turnpikes round about <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little North of <hi>Hempſted</hi> we turn'd Weſt, and came to <hi>Great Barkhamſted,</hi> about Twenty-four computed Miles from <hi>London.</hi> It is a very antient Town, which for many Hundred of Years has been one of the Crown Manors, which granted to it many very ample Privileges. It is now annexed to the Dukedom of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and as ſuch appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi> The Caſtle and Manor are at preſent held by Leaſe from the Prince, by <hi>Edward Carey,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which was obtained by his Anceſtors of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barkhamſted</hi> has evidently been a <hi>Roman</hi> Town, by the Name of <hi>Durobrivae</hi>; and probably the Caſtle ſtands upon a <hi>Roman</hi> Foundation. <hi>Roman</hi> Coins are frequently dug up there. It is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly inviron'd with high and hard Ground, full of Hedge-rows, Paſtures, and Arable, tho' ſituated upon a South-ſide of a Marſh. It extends itſelf far in handſome Buildings, and a broad Street In the Time of the Heptarchy it was the Reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Mercia</hi>; and here <hi>Wightred</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Mercia,</hi> in the Year 69, held a Parliament: here alſo King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Laws were publiſh'd.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle was judiciouſly ſet on the North-ſide of the Town, on dry Ground, amongſt Springs, and made exceedingly ſtrong by the <hi>Saxons.</hi> It was rebuilt by <hi>Moreton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Brother to <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> and razed for Rebellion in his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0141100402:170"/>
Son's Time, and ſo with the Manor fell to the Crown. <hi>Henry</hi> II. kept his Court here, and granted great Privileges to the Place. The Caſtle was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rebuilt, as it is thought, in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> for the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in Conjunction with the Barons, beſieg'd it, and the Defendants ſurrender'd not till they had the King's Orders for it.</p>
            <p>When the Caſtle was demoliſh'd, a large Houſe was built out of its Ruins, which is beautifully ſituated. What now remains of it is but the third Part, and the Back of the great Houſe; for the other two Thirds were deſtroyed by Fire in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> I. It was in King <hi>James</hi>'s Time a Nurſery for that Prince's Children; and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and Prince <hi>Charles</hi> were bred up there; and in the Time of the late Troubles, Colonel <hi>Axtel,</hi> a Parliament Officer, held it. It is now in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Roper</hi> Family.</p>
            <p>The Corporation ſunk in the War between the King and Parliament. In King <hi>Charles</hi> II.'s Time an Attempt was made to revive the Charter; but it was dropt. This Body Politick is now reduced to a Skeleton, like the Caſtle, which is only to be known by its Moats and Walls.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle contains within its firſt Moat, Four or Five Acres. There is again a Diviſion by another Moat. The South Part, conſiſting of about Two Acres, is upon a Level with moſt of the outward Walls and Chimneys remaining. Towards the North, acroſs a Moat, is a high Hill or Keep, capable of defending itſelf againſt the former, if poſſeſſed by an Enemy. The Traces of the Bridge of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and the Moat dividing theſe Two Places of Strength, are continued to the grand one, that takes in the whole Scite of the Fortification. The Remains of the Bridge for Entrance from the Town,

            <p>In this Town was the famous Interview between <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, in his March towards <hi>London,</hi> after his Victory over <hi>Harold.</hi> He paſſed the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and was going forward to <hi>St. Albans,</hi> when the ſtout Abbot <hi>Frederick</hi> ſtopp'd his March by Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till he could get the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility together, and then he made him ſwear to keep inviolably the good and antient Laws of the Kingdom; yet he took away all their Lands, and divided them among his hungry <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town gives Name to the Deanry. The Church is handſome, dedicated to St. <hi>Peter</hi>; it has had many Chapels and Oratories. On the Pillars of the Church are the Eleven Apoſtles, with each of them a Sentence of the Creed, and St. <hi>George</hi> killing a Dragon, on the Twelfth. Theſe were whited over by the Zeal of the late Times, and are but lately come to Light.</p>
            <p>The Chapel of <hi>St. John</hi> is uſed only by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Uſhers and Scholars of the Free-School. <hi>St. Leonard</hi>'s Hoſpital was at the South-eaſt End of the High-ſtreet, and <hi>St. James</hi>'s Hoſpital at the other End. The Free Grammar-School was built by Dean <hi>Incent,</hi> of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s. It is a handſome Brick Structure, with an Apartment at one End for the Maſter, at the other for the Uſher and Chantry-Clerk. It was Twenty Years in Building.</p>
            <p>They have had other large Benefactions, which we have not room for.</p>

The Church is a handſome Pile of Building, with a Ring of Six Bells. The Chancel was wainſcotted by Sir <hi>Richard Anderſon.</hi> It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and capacious, and worthy a Choir. Both Church and Chancel are paved with Free-Stone; the Pillars are painted; the Pulpit and ſounding Board are of fine Inlaid-work; and a handſome Veſtry is under the Belfry.</p>
            <p>Among other Monuments is a magnificent one for Sir <hi>William Gore</hi> and his Lady; with Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions to their Honour, but too long for a Place here.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Tring</hi> I paſſed next Eaſtward, and came to <hi>Gadeſden-Little</hi>; where I had heard was a fine Proſpect; and I wanted not Curioſity to ſee it. This Vill has <hi>Cawley-Wood,</hi> and <hi>Ivingo-Hills</hi> on the North-weſt, <hi>Aldbury-Cliffs</hi> on the South-weſt, <hi>Dunſtable-Downs</hi> to the North. The Proſpect I mean is from one Part of this Pariſh, to which a Common of fine Turf leads under the Duke of <hi>Bridgwater</hi>'s ſhady Park; and a noble one it is of Three Counties, worthy of the Pencil of the greateſt Artiſt in Landſchape.</p>
            <p>The Variety of Woods, Cliffs, Arable and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, are charming; but they muſt be tempted to half a Mile's pleaſant Exerciſe to get to the beautiful Scene.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cawley-Wood</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Leeds,</hi> is a ſmall Covert, a Mile from hence, at the Top of a Hill, in <hi>Bucks,</hi> one of the greateſt Land-marks in the South of <hi>England,</hi> which overlooks Eleven Counties.

all the modern Improvements, that Nature will not be out-done by Art.</p>
            <p>Now I am on this Subject, I ſhall juſt mention <hi>Penley-lodge,</hi> for a moſt delightful Retirement to a Man who wants to deceive Life, in an Habitation which has all the Charms Nature can give. There is behind a large Common of fine Turf, bounded on a Wood on the Weſt, to which if one aſcend a Quarter of a Mile, he has a View of <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> From the Houſe a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular Proſpect of <hi>Bedfordſhire, Middleſex,</hi> and <hi>Bucks</hi>; a bended one towards <hi>Ivingo</hi> and <hi>Aldbury-Cliffs,</hi> with the ſhady Woods of the Dukes of <hi>Leeds</hi> and <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> ſeeming to hang over the Rivulet called <hi>Bulborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Manor of <hi>Aldbury</hi> lies North-eaſt of <hi>Tring,</hi> and in the Way to <hi>Gadeſden.</hi> It belongs to the Duke of <hi>Leeds,</hi> whoſe Father married the Heireſs of the Family of <hi>Hyde</hi>; and ſo does <hi>Muniborough-Hill</hi> lie in the Way from <hi>Aldbury</hi> to <hi>Little-Gadeſden,</hi> and affords a handſome Proſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſhridge</hi> ſtands near <hi>Aldbury,</hi> but in <hi>Bucks,</hi> an antient Manſion-houſe and fine Park, belonging to the Duke of <hi>Bridgwater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gadeſden</hi> is famous for the Birth of <hi>John de Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſden,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Beginning of the Fourteenth Century; the firſt <hi>Engliſhman</hi> who was a Court Phyſician, and of whoſe Skill <hi>Chaucer</hi> makes honourable mention, in his <hi>Doctor of Phyſick,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd to his <hi>Canterbury Tales</hi>; though Dr. <hi>Freind,</hi> from <hi>John</hi>'s own Books, will not allow him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. There are ſeveral Monuments in the Chancel of this Church of the <hi>Bridgwater</hi> Family, whoſe finely ſituated Seat and Park at <hi>Aſhridge,</hi> formerly a Royal Houſe of Pleaſure, and where <hi>Edward</hi> I. held a Parliament in the Nineteenth Year of his Reign, is in this Pariſh, but in the County of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0141100402:174"/>
               <hi>Bucks.</hi> The Duke is Lord of this Manor, as alſo of that of <hi>Great-Gadeſden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I croſs'd over a Slip (as I may call it) of <hi>Bucks,</hi> which runs into <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> between <hi>Aldbury</hi> and <hi>Kenſworth-Green,</hi> which lies a little South of the Road which leads from <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s to <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> and is a Situation ſurpriſingly fine, about half a Mile in Length, a good Turf, and level with <hi>Whipſnape-Woods</hi> on the Back of it, and Rows of high Trees on the other Side. Nothing but Sky is to be ſeen from it one Way, and the other we have only a View of the Top of a Grove, at <hi>Market-Cell.</hi> It ſeems to claim a Preference of every Place in the County for a Cell, yet never had one on it: it comes very little ſhort of the famous <hi>Guy</hi>'s Cliff, near <hi>Warwick.</hi> There the ſhady Grove, and rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Stream below it, make a beautiful Scene for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: here the Woods and Trees afford Shade enough, and the pure circumambient Ether, with nothing in View but the Tops of Trees, would make a Hermit think himſelf in another World.</p>
            <p>Here I came into the Road, and ſo turned South-eaſt for <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s, thro' <hi>Flamſtead</hi> Pariſh, where is a well-built and delightful Seat of Sir <hi>Thomas-Saunders Sebright,</hi> Bart. on a riſing Ground in the middle of a Park. It is called <hi>Beechwood</hi> Manor, from the great Number of fine Beech-trees which were formerly growing here, ſome of which are yet remaining on the Sides of the Park. The Soil of this Park is, for the moſt part, dry, the Surface being ſhallow, on a ſtrong or chalky Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which renders the Turf very fine and ſhort, and very pleaſant for the Exerciſe of either riding or walking. It was formerly a Nunnery for a Prioreſs and Ten Nuns, independent of any other Convent, and then called <hi>St. Gyles in the Wood.</hi> A very ſerious Inſcription in <hi>Flamſtead</hi> Church, on a Monument of one of the <hi>Saunders</hi> Family, may
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0141100402:175"/>
be worth tranſcribing, as it certainly is a Piece of ſound Doctrine, in which every living Man may find an Uſe.</p>

               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He that looks hereon, may conſider how fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all worldly Comforts are, and how great a Vanity it is to place his Affection thereon. Such Things there are as worldly Comforts, 'tis true; but they ought to be look'd on as <hi>little Streams</hi>; and whoever delights in them, more than in the FOUNTAIN from whence they proceed, may ſoon find them dry and vaniſhed. The Truth of which he that wrote this, hath ſenſibly found; and wills others to place their Affections chiefly on that OBJECT OF LOVE, which is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and is the Centre of all true Joy and Felicity."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Purſuing ſtill the ſame Courſe along the great Road, we came next to <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s, the capital Town of <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> famous for deriving its Name from the Proto-martyr of <hi>England,</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo early in the fourth Century. 'Tis governed by a Mayor, 10 Burgeſſes, a Steward and a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, and is a peculiar Liberty both for Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Civil Government.</p>
            <p>The Town roſe out of the Ruins of old <hi>Verulam</hi>; of which ſo much has been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> and others, that we refer to them for Particulars. In that great Man's Time, the Ruins afforded much more for the Obſervation of the Curious than now; for they are ſince dug away, for mending the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. The firſt <hi>Verulam</hi> was ſtormed and taken by <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> And here <hi>Caſſibelan,</hi> a famous <hi>Britiſh</hi> King, then kept his Court. The firſt Deſtruction of the Place is ſuppoſed to have been by <hi>Boadicea,</hi> the famous <hi>Britiſh</hi> Queen, who cut off 70000 <hi>Romans</hi> in one Battle; and the ſecond, (which was erected on the Ruins of the other) in the Wars between the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0141100402:176"/>
infinite are the Numbers of Antiquities here dug up.</p>
            <p>The Origin of <hi>St. Alban</hi>'s was owing to the Monaſtery built by <hi>Offa,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> to the Memory of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> in Expiation of his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Murder of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> King of <hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> whom he had treacherouſly inveigled to his Court, on Pretence of marrying his Daughter; and the ſame <hi>Offa</hi> it was that built <hi>Hertford</hi> Cathedral, and dedicated it to <hi>St. Ethelbert,</hi> and made a Journey to <hi>Rome</hi> as further Penance, where he was abſolved, tho' he kept the murder'd Prince's Dominions, and joined them to his own.</p>
            <p>Of all the Monaſteries in <hi>England,</hi> none could outſhine this. Its Revenue was great, and its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges ſtill greater. In the Royalties it had from its Founder, and the Epiſcopal Powers from the Pope, none came up to it. The mitred Abbot had Precedency of all in <hi>England,</hi> and ſubject to no Eccleſiaſtical Power but the Pope immediately; and he had Epiſcopal Juriſdiction over both Clergy and Laity in all the Lands belonging to his Monaſtery. From firſt to laſt they were Forty-one in Number, and many of them Perſons of great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, and high Birth: the 39th of which, tho' not high-born, was Cardinal <hi>Wolſey.</hi> The laſt Abbot was <hi>Richard Boreman,</hi> who at the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quietly ſurrendred on the Royal Command, and accepted of a Penſion for Life, of 266<hi>l.</hi> 13<hi>s.</hi> and 4<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two bloody Battles were fought near this Place, between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi>; the firſt upon the 23d of <hi>May</hi> 1455, in which the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> got the Day; the ſecond on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> in the 39th of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. when the martial Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> overcame the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> who had then the King in their Power, and fought under the Sanction of his Name.</p>

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0141100402:177"/>But we muſt not diſmiſs this Subject without giving ſome brief Particulars of the famous Abbey Church. We have before obſerved, that it was founded by King <hi>Offa</hi>; but it has been rebuilt in Whole or Part ſeveral times. The Town purchaſed it at the Diſſolution, for 400<hi>l.</hi> which prevented ſo noble a Fabrick being pulled down, and torn to Pieces, for making Money of the Materials; and it is made a Pariſh Church for the Borough. The High Altar is a curious Piece of <hi>Gothick</hi> Architecture.</p>

It had a Caſtle, which was kept up till King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Time, when it was demoliſh'd, and the Scite given to the Abbey.</p>
            <p>The Ducheſs Dowager of <hi>Marlborough</hi> hath a Seat here, built by the late Duke upon the River <hi>Verlam,</hi> which runs thro' the Garden; and who alſo built handſome Alms-houſes at the Entrance of the Town.</p>
            <p>The following remarkable Inſcription and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is cut upon the Pedeſtal of a fine Statue of the late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> carved by the noted Mr. <hi>Rysbrach,</hi> and erected at <hi>St. Alban's,</hi> at the Expence of the Ducheſs, in Gratitude to the Memory of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princeſs:</p>
            <q rend="inline margQuotes">
               <p>QUEEN <hi>ANNE</hi> was very graceful and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick in her Perſon: Religious <hi>without Affectation.</hi> She always meant well. She had no <hi>falſe Ambition</hi>; which appeared, by her never complaining at King <hi>William</hi>'s being preferred to the Crown before her, when it was taken from the King her Father, for following ſuch Counſels, and purſuing ſuch Meaſures, as render'd the <hi>Revolution</hi> neceſſary. It was her greateſt Affliction, to be forced to act againſt him, even for Security. Her Journey to <hi>Nottingham</hi> was never concerted, but occaſion'd by the great Conſternation ſhe was under at the King's ſudden Return from <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She always paid the greateſt Reſpect to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; never inſiſted upon any one Circumſtance of <hi>Grandeur,</hi> more than what was <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in her Family by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. tho', after the <hi>Revolution,</hi> ſhe was preſumptive Heir to the Crown, and after the Death of her Siſter, was in the Place of Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>

Upon her Acceſſion to the Throne, the <hi>Civil Liſt was not increaſed.</hi> The late Earl of <hi>Godolphin,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> often ſaid, that, from Accidents in the Cuſtoms, and Lenity in the Collection, it did not ariſe, one Year with another, to more than Five hundred thouſand Pounds a Year.</p>
               <p>She had no <hi>Vanity</hi> in her Expences, nor bought any <hi>one Jewel</hi> in the whole Time of her Reign.</p>
               <p>She paid out of her Civil Liſt many Penſions granted in former Reigns, which have ſince been <hi>thrown upon the Publick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a War was neceſſary to ſecure <hi>Europe</hi> againſt the Power of <hi>France</hi>; ſhe contributed, in one Year, towards the War, out of her Civil Liſt, One hundred thouſand Pounds, in Eaſe of her Subjects.</p>
               <p>She granted the Revenue ariſing from the Firſt Fruits, to augment the Proviſions of the poorer Clergy.</p>
               <p>She never refuſed her private Charity to proper Objects.</p>
               <p>Till a few Years before her Death, ſhe never had but Twenty thouſand Pounds a Year for her Privy Purſe. At the latter End of her Reign, it did not exceed Twenty-ſix thouſand Pounds a Year; which was much to her Honour, becauſe it is ſubject to no Account. And as to her Robes, it will appear by the Records in the Exchequer, that in Nine Years ſhe ſpent only Thirty-two thouſand and Fifty Pounds, including the Coronation Expence.</p>
               <p>She was extremely well-bred, treated her chief Ladies and Servants as if they had been her Equals. Her Behaviour to all that approached her was decent, and full of Dignity, and ſhewed <hi>Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion,</hi> without <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Meanneſs.</hi>

            <p>Having thus gone over the firſt Part I propoſed of this Country, which lies South and South-weſt of <hi>St. Alban's</hi> Road, I ſhall now bend my Courſe North-eaſt towards <hi>Hertford,</hi> and from thence North-weſt, to take in ſuch Part of the middle Diviſion as lie between the Two capital Roads on that Side of <hi>Hertford</hi>; reſerving that which lies Eaſt of it, for my Return towards <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>The next Town in my Way is <hi>Hatfield,</hi> 17 computed Miles from <hi>London:</hi> it is a Market-town; but much more famous is <hi>Hatfield</hi> Houſe, which lies near it; from whence <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were both conducted to the Throne, having reſided here for ſome time. King <hi>James</hi> made an Exchange of this Manor in the fourth Year of his Reign, for that of <hi>Theobald</hi>'s, as hereafter mentioned, with Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who built this magnificent Houſe, and made the Vineyard in the Park, thro' which the River <hi>Lee</hi> hath its Courſe, adorning that Garden. The Rectory of <hi>Hatfield</hi> is eſteemed one of the beſt in <hi>England</hi>; <hi>Winwich</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and another in <hi>Durham,</hi> have larger Revenues; but this has a better Situation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saundridge,</hi> which lies a little North-weſt of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> deſerves to be mentioned, as it gave Title of Baron to the late great Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>; and it now belongs to his illuſtrious Relict, a Deſcendant of the Family of <hi>Jennings,</hi> of this Place. But one Thing muſt be obſerved withal, that when I was there laſt, the Steeple lay buried in its own Rubbiſh, as it had done for 40 Years together; and the Bells
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0141100402:184"/>
hung in the Church behind the Door; and this, I ſuppoſe, continues to be its preſent State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>North-Mymms</hi> ſtands a little Eaſt of <hi>Colney,</hi> and is remarkable for having in its Neighbourhood the Seat of the late Sir <hi>Joſeph Jekyll,</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, in Right of his Lady, who was Heir to her late Brother the great Lord <hi>Somers.</hi> It has a moſt delightful Proſpect. The Body of that noble Lord lies interred in the Chancel of the Church here, without any Inſcription, in Alluſion, as one would expect, to his Motto, <hi>Prodeſſe quam conſpici.</hi> This Seat is now the Property of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Leeds,</hi> (who has put a great Part of the Houſe and Gardens in good Repair) and is his Retirement from <hi>London,</hi> during any ſhort Interval that may happen in the Seſſions of Parliament.</p>
            <p>We come now to <hi>Hertford,</hi> the County Town, 20 computed Miles from <hi>London</hi>; a Corporation, governed by a Mayor and Burgeſſes. It is pleaſantly ſituated in a wholſome Air, and a dry Vale, having a good weekly Market well ſtored with Corn, and all ſort of Proviſions. It is very antient, and is built in the Form of a Y, with a Caſtle in the Middle of the two Horns. It contains ſeveral Streets and Lanes, well filled with handſome new-built Houſes. In <hi>Edward</hi> III.'s Time, it had petitioned to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden'd of the Expence of ſending Two Members to Parliament, on their Inability to pay their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives Wages: But 21. <hi>Jac.</hi> I. they petitioned to be reſtored to their Right, and ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>There is a Free Grammar School for the Children of this Town, erected by <hi>Richard Hale,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in King <hi>James</hi> I.'s Reign. The Houſe, being rebuilt a few Years ago, is a very good one. Of the Five Churches <hi>Hertford</hi> once had, there are but Two remaining, <hi>viz. All-Saints</hi> and <hi>St. Andrew</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Hertford</hi> is a Seat of Governor <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſituated on a Hill, which commands a Proſpect of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0141100402:185"/>
the Country round it, as is likewiſe, in its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, a Seat of the <hi>Clarks,</hi> very delightfully ſituated too.</p>
            <p>The Earl <hi>Cowper</hi> has a handſome Seat near <hi>Hertingfordbury,</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Hertford,</hi> built by his Father the great Lord High Chancellor of that Name; who erected in the Church-yard a Tomb for his Mother, with an Inſcription to her Honour: in this Church-yard is alſo the Tomb of Mrs. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Culling,</hi> Heireſs of a Family of that Name.</p>
            <p>The Manor of <hi>Gobions</hi> lies a little North of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and will be for ever famous on Occaſion of its being the Family-ſeat of the great Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who took off his Head, for refuſing to acknowlege his Supremacy. It is now the Property of Sir <hi>Jeremy Sambroke,</hi> Bart. who for the Beauty of its Gardens, as well as the Houſe, has made the Place one of the moſt remarkable Curioſities in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little ſtill farther North, at <hi>Wotton,</hi> is the Manſion-houſe of the <hi>Botelers,</hi> nobly ſituated on a riſing Ground, and watered with ſmall Streams, which fall into the <hi>Beane</hi> on the South of it. It ſtands in a Park beautifully conſiſting of Hills and Flats, and renowned for as good Timber as the Iſland pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. About 40 Years ſince, one Tree was ſold for 43<hi>l.</hi> 18 Horſes were had to draw one Part of it, when ſlit, and out of it the <hi>Cutwater</hi> to the <hi>Royal Sovereign</hi> was made. Another, called the <hi>Walking-Stick,</hi> might ſome Years ago have been ſold for Fifty Guineas; but was decaying when I was there, by the burrowing of Rabbets under it. There is a good Free-ſchool in this Village, for poor Children; with ſome of whom 5<hi>l.</hi> is to be given Apprentice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stevenage</hi> is 28 computed Miles from <hi>London,</hi> and lies North-weſt of <hi>Hertford.</hi> It is a ſmall Market-town: the Church ſtands upon a Hill, and conſiſts
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0141100402:186"/>
of a Nave and Two Iſles, and the Chancel hath a Chapel on each Side. In the Steeple is a Ring of Six Bells. Here is a good Free-ſchool, as well for Petit as Grammar Scholars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walkern</hi> is near it, North-eaſt, on the River <hi>Beane.</hi> I mention it on Account of the poor <hi>Jane Wenman,</hi> who within theſe 30 Years was tried for a Witch, the laſt, we hope, that ever will undergo ſuch a Trial in <hi>England</hi>; for the old obſolete Law againſt Witches was very lately repealed. Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi> got a Reprieve for the poor Creature, after the Jury had found her guilty, contrary to his Directions. She lived ſeveral Years afterwards on an Allowance from the Pariſh. The poor Wretch had been frighted into a Confeſſion, that ſhe was a Witch; and thereupon was committed by Sir <hi>Harry Chauncy,</hi> of <hi>Yardlybury,</hi> who would fain have had her retract, and pacify her Accuſers. This Gentleman was one of the deprived Judges of King <hi>James</hi> II. but it is ſaid he never ſat as Judge but one Day. He wrote <hi>The Antiquities of</hi> HERTFORDSHIRE.</p>
            <p>It is reported likewiſe, that another Woman being tried before Judge <hi>Powell,</hi> who among other Things that conſtituted her a Witch, had laid to her Charge, That ſhe could fly; <hi>Ay!</hi> ſaid the Judge; <hi>And is this true? Do you ſay you can fly? Yes, I can,</hi> ſaid ſhe.—<hi>So you may, if you will, then,</hi> replied the Judge; <hi>I have no Law againſt it.</hi>
And at the Trial of <hi>Jane Wenman,</hi> the Court being full of fine Ladies, the old Judge very gallantly told the Jury, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"They muſt not look out for Witches among the Old Women, but among the Young."</q>
            </p>
            <p>I paſſed by <hi>Benington-place,</hi> the Seat of the antient Family of the <hi>Caeſars.</hi> There was formerly a Caſtle there; the Hill on which it ſtood, ſtill remains deep ditched.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Siffivernes,</hi> in <hi>Codicote</hi> Pariſh, in the Year 1627, was a moſt prodigious Walnut-tree, covering
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0141100402:187"/>
76 Poles of Ground. The Weight of the Boughs at laſt cleft the Trunk to the Ground. Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> then Lord of the Manor, had 19 Loads of Planks out of it; a Gun-ſtock Maker at <hi>London</hi> had as much as coſt 10<hi>l.</hi> Carriage: There were 30 Loads more of Roots and Branches. This was atteſted by <hi>Edward Wingate,</hi> before a neighbouring Juſtice of Peace, to whom Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> declared, he had been offered 50<hi>l.</hi> for the Tree. And <hi>Jaſper Docura</hi> of the Pariſh atteſted, That when he was 15 Years old, the Compaſs of both his Arms would not reach round it at Eight times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hitchin</hi> is a Market-town, lying in a Bottom, out of any great Road, diſtant from <hi>London</hi> 30 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Miles, and within three Miles of <hi>Bedfordſhire.</hi> 'Tis governed by a Bailiff and Four Conſtables, and was formerly famous for the Staple Commodities of this Kingdom. The Church is large, dedicated to St. <hi>Mary.</hi> It conſiſts of the Nave and Two Ayles, with Two Chapels or Chancels. The Steeple has a Ring of Six Bells, but is low, and diſproportionate to the Chancel. In the North Ayle Window are Paintings of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and of the <hi>Four Cardinal Virtues</hi>; and in the next North Window, the <hi>Beatitudes.</hi> The Front hath the Twelve Apoſtles round it; but they have been Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers from the booted Saints of Forty-one. There are many Monuments in it. A good Free-ſchool, and other charitable Benefactions, have been made to the Town.</p>
            <p>I could not miſs taking notice of <hi>Hexton,</hi> on the North-weſt Edge of the County, next <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> where was a Battle between the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſome Remains of which are viſible between this Place and <hi>Luton,</hi> as large Barrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Half a Mile to the South of this Town is a fortify'd Piece of Ground, called <hi>Ravenſborough Caſtle.</hi> The Camp is a ſort of Oblong, containing about 16 Acres, the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0141100402:188"/>
Fortification intire. Nature has ſo well ſtrengthened it, that 1000 Men may defend it againſt a very great Army: it is incompaſſed with a Valley, and a very ſteep Hill, inacceſſible by an Army any-where but at the Point of Entrance, which is by a gradual Aſcent of a Quarter of a Mile.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Beryſlade,</hi> a Houſe poſſeſſed by <hi>John Croſs,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> tho' low and in the Dirt, is now an agreeable Summer-houſe; which it owes chiefly to <hi>St. Faith</hi>'s Well, a fine Spring at <hi>Ravensburg.</hi> A moory Piece of Ground, where the Spring riſes, is cut into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which are ſtocked with Trouts, many of them 22 Inches long. Theſe having been uſed to take their Food from the Maſter's Hand, out of a Bowl with a long Handle to it, come rolling up to the Surface. The Bottom is white, either from Chalk or Sand; and ſo tranſparent, that every Fiſh may be ſeen that comes out of its Hole. To preſerve them from Groping, the Banks are wharfed, and in ſome Places ſupported with Timber; ſo that the Fiſh can ſhelter themſelves underneath; and a Man muſt have his Head and Shoulders in Water, who ſtoops down to them. From hence the Water feeds a large Canal in the Garden ſtored with Carp and Tench; and there might be made Baſons or Canals to any Dimenſions.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Hexton</hi> is a Square <hi>Roman</hi> Camp upon a Promontory juſt big enough for the Purpoſe, and under it is a fine Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lilibo</hi> is a fine Plot of Ground upon a Hill, where a Horſe-race is kept. It lies a little South of <hi>Hexton,</hi> juſt by the <hi>Ikening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near <hi>Pirton</hi> Church has been a Caſtle of the <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Normans,</hi> with a Keep.</p>
            <p>I proceeded next to <hi>Baldock,</hi> ſituated on the <hi>Ikening-ſtreet,</hi> as it leads from <hi>Dunſtable</hi> to <hi>Royſton.</hi> It is a large Market-town, 29 computed Miles from <hi>London.</hi> It is of chief Note for its many Maltſters.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0141100402:189"/>
The Church ſtands in the Middle of the Town; it is a handſome high-built Edifice, with a Ring of Six good Bells. It has Three Chancels, but the Two outward are rather Chapels. The <hi>Ikening-ſtreet,</hi> about <hi>Baldock</hi> now appears but like a Field-way. Between <hi>Baldock</hi> and <hi>Icleford</hi> it goes thro' an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, conſiſting of the Remains of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Town, now called <hi>Wilbury-hill. Icleford</hi> retains the Name of the Street, which at this Place paſſes a Rivulet with a ſtrong Ford, wanting Reparation.</p>
            <p>This Street, quite to the <hi>Thames</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> goes at the Bottom of a continued Ridge of Hills, called the <hi>Chiltern,</hi> being Chalk, and the natural and civil Boundary between the Counties of <hi>Hertford</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> very ſteep Northward.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Ikening-ſtreet</hi> and the <hi>Foſs</hi> traverſed the Kingdom from South-weſt to North-eaſt, parallel to each other, and <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> croſſed theſe quite the contrary Way with an equal Obliquity, the <hi>Herman-ſtreet</hi> paſſed directly North and South. This Word is <hi>Saxon,</hi> and ſignifies a Soldier or Warrior, which Name it obtained from being a Military Way.</p>
            <p>It begins at <hi>Newhaven,</hi> at the Mouth of the River <hi>Ouſe</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and paſſes on the Weſt Side of that River, thro' <hi>Radmil,</hi> then thro' <hi>Lewis</hi> by <hi>Isfield</hi>; after which it ſeems to paſs over the River at <hi>Sharn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and ſo proceeds to <hi>Eaſt Grinſtead</hi>; but is loſt in paſſing thro' the great Woods. Then thro' <hi>Surry</hi> it goes by <hi>Stane-ſtreet, Croydon, Stretham,</hi> and by its pointing we may conclude was originally deſigned to paſs the <hi>Thames</hi> at the Ferry called <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> by <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where it coincides with the <hi>Watling-ſtreet.</hi> There the Road went, before <hi>London</hi> became conſiderable: but ſince that Period the Traces of the Roads near that Capital have grown very obſcure. The original Road perhaps paſſes thro' unfrequented Ways near <hi>Enfield,</hi> and <hi>Harman-ſtreet,</hi> which ſeems from thence to have borrowed its Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0141100402:190"/>On the Eaſtern Side of <hi>Enfield</hi> Chace by <hi>Buſh-hill,</hi> is a circular <hi>Britiſh</hi> Camp upon an Eminence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining South-weſt. But the antient Road appears upon a Common on this Side <hi>Hertford</hi> by <hi>Ball's-park,</hi> and paſſes the River below <hi>Hertford</hi>; then, goes thro' <hi>Ware-park,</hi> and falls into the preſent Road on this Side <hi>Buntingford,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Royſton,</hi> where it croſſes the <hi>Ikening-ſtreet,</hi> coming from <hi>Tring</hi> thro' <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> going into <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Theſe are the principal Places upon the Two Roads, which we thought fit to mention together.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Baldock</hi> I croſſed the North Road, and got into the Third Diviſion I propoſed, next <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi>; and when I have paſſed thro' it, I will return back again South, and take a View of ſuch Towns as lie on the Eaſt Side of the middle Diviſion as I have not been at already.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1724, between <hi>Caldecot</hi> and <hi>Henx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities were dug up. Workmen, digging Gravel for the Repair of the great Northern Road, ſtruck upon ſome earthen Veſſels or large Urns, full of Aſhes and burnt Bones, but rotten; near them a human Skeleton, with the Head towards the South-eaſt, the Feet North-weſt. Several Bodies were found in the ſame Poſition, not above a Foot under the Surface of the Earth, and with Urns, great or ſmall, near them, and Patera's of fine red Earth, ſome with the Impreſſion of the Maker at the Bottom; alſo Glaſs Lacrymatories, Ampulla's, a Braſs Tribulus, Six ſmall Glaſſes, Two large Beads of a Green Colour, and other Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>I went thro' the Village of <hi>Aſhwell,</hi> which ſtands not far from <hi>Caldecot,</hi> on the Source of the <hi>Rhee,</hi> by the Borders of <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> which breaks out of a Rock here from many Springs, with ſuch Force as to form a Stream remarkably clear, but ſo cold, that it gripes Horſes not uſed to drink it.

The Water here bubbles out at as many Places, and as abundantly, and in juſt ſuch a Bottom under a Hill, as doth the <hi>Iſis</hi> or <hi>Thames</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire.</hi> In <hi>Domeſday Book</hi> this Village is called a Borough, having Fourteen Burgeſſes, and a Market; antiently alſo it had Four Fairs. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> thinks the Village <hi>Roman</hi>; and at half a Mile Diſtance, South of this Source of the <hi>Rhee,</hi> is a Spot of Ground taken in by a Vallum, and generally thought to be one of the <hi>Caſtra Exploratorum</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi>; it is called <hi>Arbury Banks,</hi> and conſiſts of about 12 Acres, and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins have been found here; but ſtill it wants ſeveral Requiſites, that go to a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, which I have not room to particularize. <hi>Aſhwell-field</hi> affords a Stone Quarry, out of which the Stones of moſt of the Churches of this Side, and the neighbouring Part of <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> have been dug. The Church has a handſome Chancel, Three large Ayles, a lofty Tower at the Weſt End, with a Ring of Six Bells, and a Chapel on the North Side the Chancel.</p>
            <p>I now come to <hi>Royſton,</hi> ſituated upon the utmoſt Northern Border of <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> inſomuch that Part of it is in <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> 33 computed Miles from <hi>London.</hi> The Fields about this Towns have upon almoſt every Eminence a Barrow, and they lie very thick by the <hi>Ikening-ſtreet,</hi> Eaſt of this Town. Here was a Monaſtery founded in Honour of St. <hi>Thomas à Becket,</hi> as alſo an Hoſpital, both ſwallowed up in the Diſſolution of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. but the Priory-church was purchaſed by the Inhabitants, and made a Pariſh-church of. It conſiſts of a Nave, and an Ayle on each Side, and a ſquare Tower with a Ring of Five Bells in it.</p>

            <p>Two Miles both Ways of <hi>Royſton</hi> is chalky Soil; about <hi>Puckeridge</hi> it is gravelly: in other Places adjoining are Camps, and <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities. At <hi>Hadſtock</hi> is the Skin of a <hi>Daniſh</hi> King nailed upon the Church Doors, as reported.</p>

               <hi>Royſton</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Town before <hi>Roiſia</hi> built her religious Houſe here; for <hi>Roman</hi> Coins have been dug up near the Spot. There ſeems to be the Stamp of <hi>Roiſia</hi>'s Croſs ſtill remaining at the Corner of the Inn, juſt where the Two Roads meet. The Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> digging Canals at <hi>Wimple,</hi> when he had that Seat, found many Bodies, and ruſty Pieces of Iron, the Remains of ſome Battle.</p>

            <p>The Church of <hi>Therfield,</hi> which lies among the Hills, a little South of <hi>Royſton,</hi> is obliged to <hi>Francis</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> once Rector of it, who paved the Chancel with Free-ſtone, the Area of the Altar with Marble; wainſcoted the Walls, made it into the Form of a Choir, and ceiled it with Fret-work. 'Tis a Rectory of great Value, and is rated in the Firſt-fruits Office, at 50<hi>l.</hi> a Year. Till lately was at <hi>Therfield</hi> Furniture of all Sorts for the Uſe of poor Peoples Weddings, ſuch as was at <hi>Braughing</hi>; but they are now loſt, or converted to other Uſes, even literally to Ploughſhares and Peaſe-hooks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barkway</hi> is a Market-town. The Church ſtands in the midſt of the Town, with an Ayle on each Side, and a Tower with Five Bells, and a Turret-clock. The Creation of the World is painted on one of the Windows. In one Pane at Top is a bodily Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Deity, as a Man in a looſe R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The Painting of the Fourth is loſt. The Fifth has the ſame Figure, with Birds flying about it. A Piece of the Sixth remains, where Fowls and Beaſts are brought to <hi>Adam</hi> to be named.

            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Road, called <hi>Ermine-ſtreet,</hi> paſſes thro' the Pariſh of <hi>Amſty</hi>; and all the Way upon it we find Remains of Camps and Stations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the Itinerary. The Caſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly here, was ſaid to be built by <hi>Euſtace</hi> Earl of <hi>Bologne,</hi> at the Conqueror's Command; and it is not improbable, that there were Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations before. It conſiſted of a Keep, or round artificial Hill, yet remaining, with a large and deep Foſſe about it; the Mount, probably, made from the Ditch. The Barons, in King <hi>John</hi>'s Time, made another Retrenchment South of it, which would contain a Gariſon as numerous as the Caſtle would hold. <hi>Henry</hi> III. obliged <hi>Nicolas de Aveſtic</hi> to demoliſh the additional Fortification, and keep up only the old one.</p>
            <p>The Church was built in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. as is ſaid, out of the Stones of the demoliſhed Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications made additional to the Caſtle. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very old, and built with a low Tower in the Middle, and Two Ayles. The Chancel, perhaps, was rebuilt with the Materials of the Keep, being of later Date. It is large and lofty, and hath Stalls, as if for a Choir.</p>

               <hi>Buntingford</hi> is the next Town, and lies in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Road, noted for a great Thorough-fare, 28 computed Miles from <hi>London,</hi> and owes its Being as a Town to the preſent Poſt-road through it to the North. The firſt Mention of it is in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. who gave a Market and a Fair to it. It is ſituated in <hi>Layſton</hi> Pariſh; but has a Chapel of Brick, built by Contribution for the Inhabitants here. Dr. <hi>Seth Ward</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who died <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. 1688, built a neat Brick-houſe near the Chapel, for Four poor Men, and Four poor Women, who had lived handſomely, and came to Decay thro' Misfortunes; each of which has Two Rooms below, and Two above. <hi>Buntingford</hi> Free-ſchool owes much alſo to the ſame worthy Prelate, who had his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in it. He built, 1683, an Hoſpital at <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> for Ten poor Widows of Clergymen, was a Benefactor to <hi>Layſton,</hi> gave a good Sum of Money to make <hi>Salisbury</hi> River navigable; 600<hi>l.</hi> to be laid out in Land, for putting out Three poor Children Apprentices, Two out of <hi>Alſeden,</hi> and One out of <hi>Layſton,</hi> alternately. In ſhort, the good Biſhop ſeems to have thought, that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues he reaped from the Church, ought to have ſome other more publick Deſignation, than to lift out of Obſcurity a private Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Braughing</hi> lies a little on the Eaſt of the Road, was antiently, next to <hi>Verulam,</hi> the moſt conſiderable Place in the County, and is thought to have been the <hi>Roman Caeſaromagum,</hi> ſituated 28 Miles from <hi>London,</hi> as by <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s <hi>Itinerary.</hi> It ſtill has ſome Ruins of its antient Eminence, giving Name to the Deanry and the Hundred. On the Weſt Side the <hi>Ermin-ſtreet,</hi> now the Road to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> we find the Ruins of a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp. The Church is an handſome Building, and hath a Ring of Five good Bells.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0141100402:195"/>Near the Church-yard is an old Houſe, at preſent inhabited by poor Families, which was given with all Sorts of Furniture for Weddings. They brought hither their Proviſions, and had a large Kitchen, with a Caldron, large Spits and Dripping-pan; a large Room for Merriment; a Lodging-room with a Bride-bed and good Linen; ſome of which Furniture was in being a few Years ago.</p>
            <p>This Proviſion was alſo at <hi>Therfield,</hi> and the Kitchen Utenſils, but lately loſt.</p>
            <p>We proceeded thro' <hi>Puckridge,</hi> a little Hamlet Town, but a great Thorough-fare, ſtanding on the <hi>Ermin-ſtreet,</hi> where there are ſeveral good Inns for Travellers, and came to <hi>Standon,</hi> a ſmall Market-town. The Church hath Three Ayles; the Floor of the Chancel is Seven Steps above that of the Church, and the Altar Three Steps above the Chancel-floor.</p>
            <p>Here we turn'd ſhort to the Eaſt, to viſit <hi>Biſhop-Stortford,</hi> lying on the Borders of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> 27 Miles from <hi>London.</hi> The Conqueror gave this Town and Caſtle to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> whence its <hi>Praenomen</hi>; and King <hi>John</hi> ſeized and demoliſhed it, for the Offence of the then Biſhop, who was one of thoſe who publiſhed the Pope's Interdict againſt the Nation. The Town, in the ſame Reign, was incorporated, and returned Members to Seven ſucceſſive Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Biſhop was reſtored by the ſame Prince, and Satisfaction made him for demoliſhing the Caſtle. The Hill or Keep of the Caſtle is artificial, made of Earth carried thither, with a Breaſt-work at Top of Stones and Morter. A Bank of Earth leads from it thro' the moory Ground, on which it was ſituated, to the North-eaſt. There is a large Wall from the Top of the Hill yet remaining. The Biſhop's Priſon was in being in Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Time; tho' all the old Buildings are ſince demoliſhed. But the Caſtle-guard is ſtill paid by ſeveral Places to the Biſhop, beſides other Quit-rents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0141100402:196"/>The Town is large, and well-built; it is a Thorough-fare from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Cambridge, New-market,</hi> and <hi>St. Edmundſbury,</hi> and full of convenient Inns. It is built in the Form of a Croſs, having four Streets turn'd to the Cardinal Points, and the River <hi>Stort</hi> runs thro' it.</p>
            <p>The Church dedicated to <hi>St. Michael,</hi> is lofty, and ſtands on high Ground; it hath a fine Ring of Eight Bells. There were antiently Three Guilds and a Chantry founded here. In the Church are Nine Stalls on a Side, for a Choir. On the North Side the Church is a Gallery for the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the School, built by Contribution; upon it Sir <hi>John Hobart</hi>'s Arms, who was educated there, and a great Benefactor to this Work.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt End is another Gallery, built a few Years ago, upon which is an Organ; and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that there was an Organ in this Church ſo long ago as in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. A new Font ſtands before it, with a Pavement of Black and White Marble, incloſed with Iron Ralis.</p>
            <p>There are a great Number of Monuments in the Church, particularly one in the North Ayle, for Seven Children of <hi>Edward Mapheſden,</hi> who died of the Small-pox, with a <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcription, deploring that heavy Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>Several Benefactions are beſtowed on the Poor of this Town, particularly Two Alms-houſes in <hi>Potters-ſtreet.</hi> But the greateſt Ornament of the Town is the School, built 35 Years ago, by Contribution of the Gentlemen of <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> at the Requeſt of Dr. <hi>Thomas Tooke</hi> late Maſter, who alſo procured ſeveral Sums for completing it, from the young Gentlemen educated here. When this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman engaged in it, it was at the loweſt Ebb of Reputation; but he raiſed it to a great Degree of Fame, and conſiderably increaſed the Trade of the Town, by the beneficial Concourſe that it
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0141100402:197"/>
brought thither. He revived the annual School-feaſt, and charged his own Eſtate with a yearly Preſent to the Preacher on that Occaſion. He died <hi>May</hi> 4. 1721, after upwards of 30 Years ſucceſsful and diligent Labours here. By his Intereſt and Care the Gallery in the Church, for the Uſe of the School, was erected: He gave a Chalice of 20<hi>l.</hi> Value to the Church, and was a great Benefactor to the School Library, which is a very good one, and was firſt ſet on foot by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Thomas Leigh,</hi> B. D. who was Vicar of the Church <hi>Anno</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>The School ſtands in the High-ſtreet, with the Weſt Front to the Church-yard, conſiſting of Three Rooms, which, with the Stair-caſe, make a ſquare Building. The Grammar School takes up half of it, all the Front to the Street; the other Two are the Library, and Writing-ſchool. Theſe ſtand upon Arches, under which are a Market and Shops, which are the Property of the Pariſh; and here the School was built at the Deſire of the Inhabitants, who got by it a Covering for their Market, and at the ſame time an Ornament to their Town.</p>
            <p>Every Gentleman at leaving the School preſents a Book to the Library.</p>

There are alſo new Offices erected at a little Diſtance from the Houſe, in a Quadrangle, on the ſame Plan with the King's <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Charing-croſs.</hi> They are placed behind a large Plantation of Trees, ſo that they do not appear until you are near upon them, yet are at a convenient Diſtance from the Manſion-houſe, which I was informed his Lordſhip alſo propoſes to rebuild.</p>
            <p>The Manor of <hi>Theobalds</hi> is in this Neighbourhood, where formerly was built a magnificent Seat by Lord

Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who gave it his younger Son Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> and he exchanged it for that of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> at the Deſire of King <hi>James</hi> I. who made it his Sporting Seat; and here ended his Life. From this Place <hi>Charles</hi> I. ſet out to erect his Standard at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> II. made a Grant of it to <hi>Monck,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and to his Male Iſſue, which failing in his Son <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> King <hi>William</hi> gave it to <hi>Bentinck,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> in whoſe Grandſon, the preſent Duke, it ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. In the late Civil Wars the Palace was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and defaced; and is become a poor Village, from a Royal Reſidence. The great Park, which was incloſed within a Wall of 10 Miles Compaſs, by King <hi>James,</hi> is now converted into Farms. The Place is however popular, and the <hi>New River</hi> runs juſt by, and ſometimes thro' the Gardens of the Inhabitants. In this Neighbourhood <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> the abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Protector, paſſed the laſt Part of his Life in a very private Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waltham-croſs</hi> is the next, and, as you enter <hi>Middleſex</hi> by the North Road, the laſt Place in <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> ſtanding juſt on the Edge of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex.</hi> It is noted for, and takes its Name from, the Croſs, built by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. in Honour of his beloved Queen <hi>Eleanor,</hi> whoſe Corps, in its Way from <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> reſted here; as a Croſs was built at every Stage where it reſted, and <hi>Charing-croſs</hi> was the laſt.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NOW proceed to give you an Account of my next Journey thro' Part of <hi>Bucks,</hi> into <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and ſhall touch upon ſome Parts of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> of which I have not-yet taken notice.</p>
            <p>On the Right-hand, as we ride from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Uxbridge</hi> or to <hi>Colebrook,</hi> we ſee <hi>Harrow</hi>; the Church of which ſtanding on the Summit of an Hill, and having a very high Spire, they tell us, King <hi>Charles</hi> II. ridiculing the warm Diſputes among ſome critical Scripturaliſts of thoſe Times, concerning the <hi>Viſible</hi> Church of Chriſt upon Earth; uſed to ſay, This was it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Uxbridge</hi> we proceeded on the Road towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> and came to <hi>Beaconsfield,</hi> a ſmall Town on the Road to <hi>Oxford,</hi> full of good Inns, and ſituated on a dry Hill, famous for the Reſidence of Mr. <hi>Edmund Waller,</hi> eminent for his poetical Talent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0141100402:204"/>Then we went on to <hi>Wickham,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Chipping Wycoomb,</hi> from <hi>Coomb,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word for Valley. This is a large Town, conſiſting of one great principal Street, branching out into divers ſmall ones. It is full of good Houſes and Inns, being a great Thorough-fare from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Wickham</hi> lies <hi>Amerſham</hi> or <hi>Agmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſham,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, very antient; and a little beyond it you go thro' <hi>Cheſham,</hi> a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Market-town; and likewiſe <hi>Wendover,</hi> a mean, dirty corporate Town. From hence we proceeded to <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> which is the largeſt and beſt Town in the County.—It ſtands on a Hill, but the Country round it is low and dirty. It conſiſts of ſeveral large Streets, and has a handſome built Market-houſe, which ſtands in a kind of Quadrangle. It has alſo a Town-houſe, where the Aſſizes and Seſſions, and other publick Meetings of the County, are held. Proviſions are here cheap and plentiful, which is owing to the rich Vale adjoining. It was a ſtrong Town in the Beginning of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Time, and a Manor Royal in that of the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s, who parcell'd it out under this odd Tenure, That the Tenants ſhould find <hi>Litter or Straw for the King's Bed-chambers</hi> Three times a Year, if he came that Way ſo often, and provide him Three Eels in Winter, and Three Green Geeſe in Summer; which would be but a mean Entertainment at Bed and Board for a King in theſe Days.</p>
            <p>All round this Town is a large Track of the richeſt Land in <hi>England,</hi> extended for many Miles almoſt from <hi>Tame,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> to <hi>Leighton</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> and is called from this very Town, <hi>The Vale of Aylesbury.</hi> It is famous for fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening Cattle and Sheep, and 'tis frequent that they ſell a Ram here for Breeding for Ten Pounds. Here it was, that converſing with ſome Gentlemen who underſtood Country Affairs, (for all Gentlemen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0141100402:205"/>
are Graziers, tho' all the Graziers are not Gentlemen) they ſhewed me one remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Field of Paſture-ground, which was lett for 1400<hi>l. per Ann.</hi> to a Grazier; and I knew the Tenant very well, whoſe Name was <hi>Houghton,</hi> who confirmed the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>The late Duke of <hi>Wharton</hi> had a very fine Seat at <hi>Winchenden,</hi> and another much finer nearer <hi>Windſor,</hi> called <hi>Ubourn.</hi> But the Cataſtrophe that has befallen this once flouriſhing and truly noble Family, is too melancholy, and too well known, to be animadverted upon here.</p>
            <p>Near this Place lies <hi>Chilton,</hi> famous for giving Birth to that ſteddy Patriot the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Crook,</hi> who ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the arbitrary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of levying Ship-money without the Authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>South-weſt of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> lies the Market-town of <hi>Tame,</hi> ſituated on the Side of a Meadow, and almoſt incompaſſed with Rivulets. It conſiſts of one long broad Street. The Church is large and fine, in Form of a Croſs; near which are the Ruins of a Priory. A Pot of <hi>Roman</hi> Coin was found here about 15 Years ſince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thame</hi> joins the other Branch, named alſo the <hi>Thames,</hi> at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> In this Vale of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> flouriſhed the great and antient Family of <hi>Hampden,</hi> for many Ages, in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of very large Eſtates, which, like that of <hi>Wharton,</hi> are now diſſipated.</p>
            <p>At the Confluence of the <hi>Thame</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi> ſtands <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> a Town of Note among the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the Year 634 was made a Biſhop's See, till <hi>Remigius,</hi> in 1094, removed it to <hi>Lincoln.</hi> It has a very large Church, and a fine large Stone Bridge, of great Length and Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Eaſt of <hi>Aylesbury</hi> lies <hi>Ivingo,</hi> a pleaſant Market-town ſituate among Woods, in a Nook, or kind of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0141100402:206"/>
Peninſula, which runs in between <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> and <hi>Hertfordſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſed forward North-weſt thro' <hi>Win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>low,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the County-Town, ſituated in a low, fruitful Ground, ſurrounded by the <hi>Ouze</hi> on all Sides but the North. 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff and Capital Burgeſſes. The Caſtle is now old and ruinous, and the Buildings of the Town are alſo old. It has Three Stone Bridges over the River, and a well-built Church, and a Chapel built by Archbiſhop <hi>Becket,</hi> which is now uſed for a Free-ſchool. Several Paper-mills are erected on the <hi>Ouze,</hi> and the Town is divided into two Parts; one where the Church ſtands, and the other where the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall is. The County Gaol, and Court, are kept here, and ſometimes the Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>Going ſtill farther Northward, we come to the following Towns:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stony Stratford</hi> is remarkable for ſtanding on the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſeway, called <hi>Watling-ſtreet.</hi> It is an antient and well-known Thoroughfare Town in the <hi>Cheſter</hi> Road from <hi>London.</hi> It is large, and well-built of Stone, has Two Churches in it, and a Croſs erected by <hi>Edward</hi> I. to the Honour of his Queen <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and has a good Stone Bridge over the River. The principal Manufacture, as well in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood as in the Town, is Bone-lace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newport-pagnell</hi> is a large well-built, populous Town, ſeated on the River <hi>Ouze,</hi> over which it has Two large Stone Bridges. It carries on a great Trade in Bone-lace, and the ſame Manufacture imploys alſo the neighbouring Villages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oulney</hi> is a pretty good Town, where alſo is carried on a conſiderable Manufacture of Bone-lace. It lies on the Extremity of the County.</p>
            <p>We then fell down, back again, to <hi>Buckingham</hi>; and following the great Road North-weſt, we came to <hi>Brackley,</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> ſituate on the River
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0141100402:207"/>
               <hi>Ouze,</hi> an antient large corporate Town, in which are Two Pariſh Churches. It had formerly a College, but it is now uſed for a Free-ſchool. It is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen; and the Market uſed to be the Staple for Wool, in that County; but it is now removed.</p>
            <p>We next came to <hi>Banbury</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> on the River <hi>Charwell.</hi> It is a large Market-town under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen. It has a conſiderable Trade, eſpecially in Cheeſe, as all the Country round it is a rich feeding Meadow-ground. Here the famous <hi>Make-king,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> ſurpriſed the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and his Brother, of the Party of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. and beheaded them.</p>
            <p>On the Borders of this County Weſtward from this Town in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> was the famous Battle of <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> fought between the Forces of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and thoſe of the Parliament; where, tho' the Victory was dubious, yet the Advantage, in the Event, inclined to the King's Side; for he thereupon took Lord <hi>Say</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Broughton,</hi> and <hi>Banbury</hi> Caſtle, in which were 800 Foot, and a Troop of Horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edge-hill</hi> lies at the Weſt End of the Vale of <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe,</hi> and gives a moſt extenſive Proſpect. It is ſteep to the North, and on the Top of it, at <hi>Warmlington,</hi> is a ſtrong large Entrenchment, ſaid to be <hi>Daniſh,</hi> but looks more like <hi>Britiſh.</hi> On the Deſcent of the Hill, between <hi>Radway</hi> and <hi>Keynton,</hi> was fought the aforementioned Battle; here alſo they ſhew where the Slain were bury'd, and have a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that King <hi>John</hi> had a Palace, and reſided at <hi>Keyntor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was likewiſe, at <hi>Cropredy</hi> Bridge, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter between the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> and the <hi>Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arians</hi> under <hi>Waller</hi>'s Command.</p>
            <p>Weſt of <hi>Edge-hill</hi> ſtands <hi>Shipton,</hi> a little Town, which has a very large Market.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0141100402:208"/>
               <hi>Banbury</hi> gave Title of Earl to the noble Family of <hi>Knolles,</hi> which it ſeems became extinct in 1632, when the laſt Earl died; but his Wife, marrying <hi>Nicolas</hi> Lord <hi>Vaux,</hi> had a Son by him, who took the Name of <hi>Knolles,</hi> and the Title of Earl; but was never ſummoned to Parliament, nor his Son after him, who is now living, and commonly called Lord <hi>Banbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we rode Southward to <hi>Deddington,</hi> a large Town, but a very ſmall Market. It is govern'd by a Bailiff, and did formerly return Members to Parliament.</p>
            <p>We turned a little Eaſt, and came to <hi>Biceſter,</hi> a ſtraggling indifferent Town; but remarkable for having had once a famous City in its Neighbourhood, called <hi>Aldcheſter,</hi> long ſince paſſed over by the Plough; and where many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, Stones, and other Antiquities are found; which was undoubtedly the <hi>Maima</hi> of <hi>Ravennas. Biceſter</hi> is famous for excellent Malt Liquor, and has had formerly a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſlip</hi> lying directly in our Way to <hi>Oxford,</hi> we paſſed thro' it. It is remarkable for the Birth of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and that Dr. <hi>South,</hi> as well as other eminent Divines, were Miniſters here. There are ſome Remains of an antient Palace ſtill left.</p>
            <p>From hence I came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> famous for ſeveral Things, but chiefly for its being the moſt flouriſhing and conſiderable Univerſity in the World.</p>
            <p>There has been a long Conteſt between the Two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Univerſities, about the Priority of their Foundations, which perhaps will never be decided, and ſo I paſs it over.</p>
            <p>It is out of Queſtion, that in the Largeneſs of the Place, the Beauty of Situation, the Number of Inhabitants, and of Scholars, <hi>Oxford</hi> has the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In ſhort, <hi>Oxford</hi> has ſeveral Things as an
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0141100402:209"/>
Univerſity, which <hi>Cambridge</hi> has not; and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> has ſeveral Things in it, which cannot be found in <hi>Oxford.</hi> For Example,</p>
            <p>The Theatre, the Muſeum or Chamber of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library, the Number of Colleges, and the Magnificence of their Buildings, are on the Side of <hi>Oxford</hi>; yet <hi>King's</hi> College Chapel, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, is in favour of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> being one of the fineſt Structures of its kind that can be ſeen; and the new Buildings erected lately there, make that whole Univerſity ſtill more conſiderable in this way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oxford</hi> is a noble flouriſhing City, ſo poſſeſſed of all that can contribute to make the Reſidence of the Scholars eaſy and comfortable, that no Spot of Ground in <hi>England</hi> goes beyond it. It is ſituated in a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Plain, on the Bank of a fine navigable River, in a plentiful Country, and at an eaſy Diſtance from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City itſelf is large, populous and rich: and as it is adorn'd by the moſt beautiful Buildings of Colleges and Halls, it makes the moſt noble Figure of any City of its Bigneſs in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall preſent our Readers with a Liſt of the Colleges and Halls in this famous City, with a brief Hiſtory of them; but muſt obſerve, that as it would exceed our Limits to give an Account of the particular Benefactions by which their Revenues and Buildings are ſo ſplendidly augmented, we ſhall only mention ſuch of thoſe Benefactions as have been conferred within ſo few Years back, that they are not likely to be found in other Authors.</p>

the Year 721, is certain; but how much ſooner, is not evident.

                              <p>Before the very noble Benefaction of Dr. <hi>Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe,</hi> it had one large beautiful Quadrangle, or ſquare Court; the South Side of which is divided into a handſome Hall and Chapel.

In the ſtately Tower, in the Front of the Gate, hangs the great Bell, called <hi>Tom</hi>; which was removed thither out of the Steeple of the Cathedral, by Biſhop <hi>Fell.</hi> It is Seven Feet and an Inch Diameter, and Five Feet Nine Inches high; and weighs near 17,000 Pounds Weight. This Bell is tolled every Night 101 Strokes, agreeable to the Number of Students in the College, to give Warning for ſhutting up the Gates in the Colleges and Halls in the Univerſity.</p>
                              <p>The Buildings of this College are very large, auguſt and ſplendid.

The Cathedral is lofty, but no elegant Structure; the Hall and Library high and ſpacious; and the latter contains a noble Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Books, to which Dr. <hi>Aldrich,</hi> late Dean, made a fine Addition.

            <p>You will refer, Sir, to the Accounts I have already given of the Colleges, and to the above Abſtracts of Dr. <hi>Radcliff</hi>'s, and Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi>'s Wills, and you will have a View of the State of theſe Colleges, even when the Works are finiſhed as directed by thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and which will hold for Years to come without material Alteration, except in caſe of new Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now give a Summary of what a Traveller may obſerve further in <hi>Oxford, en paſſant</hi>; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the more curious Inquirer to the Hiſtories of the Place, for a more ample and particular Account, than I have room to give.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Colleges and Halls, there are ſome publick Buildings, which make a moſt glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: The firſt and greateſt of all is the <hi>Theatre,</hi> a Building not to be equall'd by any thing of its Kind and Bigneſs in the World. Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wren</hi> was the Director of the Work. Archbiſhop <hi>Sheldon</hi> paid for it, and gave it to the Univerſity: there is a world of Decoration in the Front of it, and more beautiful Additions, by way of Ornament; and the inſide Roof, finely painted and decorated, is never enough to be admired.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library is an Ornament in itſelf worthy of this famous Univerſity. I have not Room for its Hiſtory at large, but ſhall briefly obſerve, that the firſt publick Library in <hi>Oxford</hi> was erected in <hi>Durham</hi> College, now <hi>Trinity,</hi> by <hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0141100402:229"/>
               <hi>Durham,</hi> Lord Treaſurer to <hi>Edward</hi> III. it was afterward joined to another, founded by <hi>Cobham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and both inlarged by the Bounty of <hi>Humphry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> Founder of the Divinity Schools. But theſe Libraries being loſt, and the Books embezzled, and the Place where they were depoſited, quite ruinous, Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley,</hi> a wealthy and learned Knight, having, at a vaſt Expence, collected Books and Manuſcripts from all Parts of the World, placed them in the old Library-room, built by the good Duke <hi>Humphry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Work was brought to an Head the 8th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1602, and has continued increaſing by the Benefactions of great and learned Men to this Day; ſuch as Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Pembroke, Oliver Cromwell, Selden, Digby,</hi> and other great Names.</p>
            <p>Over it is a ſpacious Gallery, adorned with Pictures of Founders, Benefactors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with the antique Marbles, which were the learned Part of the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Collection of the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> which have been illuſtrated with the accurate Comments of <hi>Selden</hi> and <hi>Prideaux.</hi> Here are ſome of the moſt valuable <hi>Greek</hi> Monuments now in the World. Over the Porch, upon an handſome Pedeſtal of black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſtands the Braſs Effigies of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> their noble and generous Chancellor, given by the late Earl, moulded by <hi>Rubens.</hi> Alſo a very large Collection of <hi>Greek, Roman, Britiſh, Saxon, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and other Coins, preſented by Sir <hi>T. Roe,</hi> and other Hands. And that indefatigable and learned Collector of Books, and valuable Manuſcripts, Dr. <hi>Tanner,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> who died <hi>December</hi> 12. 1735, bequeathed the moſt curious Part of his fine Collection to this noble Library.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1740, by the Death of Mrs. <hi>Crew,</hi> Relict of <hi>George Crew,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> an Eſtate of 80<hi>l. per Annum</hi> is fallen to the Head Librarian's Poſt, which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0141100402:230"/>
before was very inconſiderable, tho' it required a conſtant Reſidence. This was a Legacy of the late Right Reverend and Right Honourable <hi>Nathanael Crew,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who was ſuch a good Benefactor to <hi>Lincoln</hi> College as we have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Other curious Things in <hi>Oxford</hi> are, the Schools, (which are now beautifully repaired, and the Names and Arms of old Benefactors renewed and repainted) the Muſeum, the Chamber of Rarities, the Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Coins, Medals, Pictures, and antient Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Printing-houſe, the Phyſick-garden, the Univerſity and other Churches, the Convocation-houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all worthy of a particular Deſcription, had I room to give it.</p>
            <p>The Univerſity is govern'd by a Chancellor, choſen by Scrutiny or Collection of Votes; he is generally one of the firſt Noblemen of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>By a High-ſteward, choſen by the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>By a Vice-chancellor, who muſt be one of the Heads of a College, recommended to the Univerſity by the Chancellor.</p>
            <p>By Two Proctors, choſen annually by Turn out of the Colleges.</p>
            <p>The other Officers are the publick Orator, and the Keeper of the Archives, Beadles, Virger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' I have ſaid ſo much of the Univerſity, I muſt not quite forget the City. Let me then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That before <hi>Baliol</hi> College they ſhew the Stone in the Street, which marks the Place of the Martyrdom of Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> then upon the Banks of the Ditch, without the City Walls, which went along where the Theatre now ſtands.</p>
            <p>Beyond the River, ſtood <hi>Oſeny</hi> Abbey, founded 1129. Upon the Bridge is a Tower, call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>Frier</hi> Bacon<hi>'s Study,</hi> from that famous and learned Monk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0141100402:231"/>Over another Bridge, on the <hi>Iſis,</hi> we went to ſee <hi>Ruleigh</hi> Abbey, where ſome Ruins ſtill remain, turn'd to a common Brewhouſe.</p>
            <p>Of the Caſtle remains a ſquare high Tower, by the River-ſide, and a lofty Mount, or Keep, walled at Top, with a Stair-caſe going downward.</p>
            <p>The <hi>White-friers</hi> was a Royal Palace, and near a Green called <hi>Beaumonds,</hi> they ſhew'd us the Bottom of a Tower upon the Spot where the valiant <hi>Richard</hi> I. was born.</p>
            <p>Without the Town, on all Hands, are to be ſeen the Fortifications erected in the late Civil Wars.</p>
            <p>As to the City, tho' the Colleges make up Two-thirds of it, and are ſtill elbowing for more Room, yet 'tis large and regular, the Streets are ſpacious, clean, and ſtrait; the Place pleaſant and healthful, the Inhabitants genteel and courteous; the Churches many and elegant, eſpecially <hi>Allhallows</hi>; and taking it altogether, and including the Grandeur and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of the Colleges, their Chapels, Halls, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, Quadrangles, Piazza's, Gardens, Walks, Groves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it muſt be conſider'd as the firſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in the World, as I have before mention'd.</p>
            <p>On the Left-hand, on the other Side the River, the laſt Remains of <hi>Godſtow</hi> Nunnery are ſituated among the ſweet Meadows. Here fair <hi>Roſamond</hi> had a remarkably fine Tomb; but before the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſcarce could her Aſhes reſt, <hi>whoſe Beauty was thought guilty,</hi> as one ſays, <hi>even after Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot leave <hi>Oxford</hi> without making one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, with regard to thoſe who inſiſt, that it was to the Piety of the Popiſh Times which we owe the firſt Inſtitution of the Univerſity itſelf, the Foundation and Endowment of the particular Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and the Encouragement ariſing to Learning from thence: all which I readily grant; but would have them remember too, that tho' thoſe Foundations ſtood, as they tell us, 800 Years, and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0141100402:232"/>
as they ſay, is not above 200 Years ſtanding, yet Learning has more increaſed, and the Univerſities flouriſh'd more; more great Scholars been produced, greater Libraries been raiſed, and more fine Buildings been erected, in theſe 200 Years, than in the 800 Years of Popery; and I might add, as many great Benefactions have been given, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this very momentous Difference, that the Proteſtants Gifts are merely Acts of Charity to the World, and Acts of Bounty, in Reverence to Learning, and learned Men, without the grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of the State of their own Souls, and thoſe of their Fathers, which were to be pray'd out of Purgatory, and get a ready Admiſſion into Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oxford</hi> was for many Years advantaged by the Neighbourhood of the Royal Court, while ſeveral Kings of <hi>England,</hi> being taken with the fine Situation of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> made their Palace there the Place of their Summer Retreat.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Plott</hi> allows it to have been a Royal Houſe ever ſince King <hi>Alfred</hi>; and a Manuſcript in the <hi>Cotton</hi> Library confirms it; and that King <hi>Henry</hi> I. was not the Founder of it, but only rebuilt it. And as for <hi>Henry</hi> II. who kept his fair <hi>Roſamond</hi> in it, he made only ſome Additions to it, for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Security of his beautiful Miſtreſs. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, the Queen, having got Acceſs to her in the King's Abſence, as Tradition informs us, diſpatch'd her by Poiſon.</p>
            <p>When I was firſt at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> ſome Years ago, I ſaw part of the old Palace, and the famous Labyrinth of fair <hi>Roſamond</hi>; but now theſe are deſtroy'd. Her <hi>Bathing-place</hi> or <hi>Well,</hi> as it is called, is left; a quadrangular Receptacle of pure Water, immediately flowing from a little Spring under the Hill, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow'd with Trees; near which are ſome Ruins of Walls and Arches. King <hi>Ethelred</hi> called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here. It has been a Royal Seat, as I have ſaid,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0141100402:233"/>
from moſt antient Times. <hi>Henry</hi> I. incloſed the Park. Acroſs this Valley was a remarkably fine Echo, that would repeat a whole Hexameter, but impair'd by the Removal of theſe Buildings. A ſtately Bridge, or Rialto rather, now leads along the grand Approach to the preſent Caſtle: one Arch is above 190 Feet Diameter; a Caſcade of Water falls from a Lake down ſome ſtone Steps into the Canal that runs under it.</p>
            <p>The new Palace of <hi>Blenheim</hi> is a vaſt and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Pile of Building; a Royal Gift to the high Merit of the invincible Duke of <hi>Marlborough.</hi> The lofty Hall is painted by Sir <hi>James Thornhill,</hi> the Ceiling by <hi>la Guerre.</hi> The Rooms are finely inrich'd with Marble Chimney-pieces and Furniture, but more by the incomparable Paintings and Hangings, which latter repreſent the principal Glories of the Duke's Life. Among the Pictures are many of <hi>Rubens</hi>'s beſt and largeſt Pieces; that celebrated one of himſelf, his Wife and Child, among others: <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyke</hi>'s King <hi>Charles</hi> I. upon a Dun Horſe, of great Value: and the famous Loves of the Gods, by <hi>Titian</hi>; a Preſent from the King of <hi>Sardinia.</hi> The Gallery is worthy Admiration, lined with Marble Pilaſters, and whole Pillars of one Piece, ſupporting a moſt coſtly and curious Entablature, excellent for Matter and Workmanſhip, the Window-frames of the ſame, and a Baſement of black Marble quite round. Before it, is ſtretched out a moſt agreeable Proſpect of the fine Woods beyond the great Valleys. What is of the moſt elegant Taſte in the whole Houſe, is of the Ducheſs's own Deſigning. The Chapel is equal to the reſt. The Garden is a very large Plot of Ground taken out of the Park, and may ſtill be ſaid to be a Part of it, well-contriv'd by ſinking the outer Wall into a Foſs, to give a View quite round, and take off the odious Appearance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement and Limitation to the Eye. It is within
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0141100402:234"/>
well adorn'd with Walks, Greens, Eſpaliers, and Viſta's, to divers remarkable Objects, that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the circumjacent Country. Over the Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Front of the Houſe is a curious Marble Buſto of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. bigger than the Life, taken from the Gate of the Citadel of <hi>Tournay.</hi> The Orangery is a pretty Room. Near the Gate of the Palace is the Houſe where our famous <hi>Chaucer</hi> was born. At the Entrance into the Caſtle from the Town, her Grace has erected a noble triumphal Arch, to the Memory of the Duke; and has ſet up a vaſt Obeliſk in the principal Avenue of the Park, whereon is inſcribed the beſt Account of the Duke's Actions and Character, that ever was penn'd in the ſame Compaſs; and if done by the maſterly Hand of that extraordinary Genius, to whom I have heard it attributed, muſt be a double Triumph to the Memory of the Duke, ſince his Merits extorted ſo noble a Teſtimony from a Perſon who was once engaged in Meaſures quite oppoſite to thoſe, which derived upon his Grace ſo exalted a Reputation, and who was thought to be at that Time one of his principal Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>The Inſcription does ſo much Honour to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Duke, and at the ſame time to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, that I cannot deny to myſelf the Pleaſure of inſerting it here, as follows:

                  <p>Embaſſador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary<lb/>To the <hi>States General</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke contracted ſeveral Alliance before the Death of King WILLIAM. He confirmed and improved theſe. He contracted others, after the Acceſſion of Queen ANNE; and reunited the Confederacy, which had been diſſolved at the End of a former War, in a ſtricter and firmer League.</p>
                  <p>Captain-General and Commander in Chief<lb/>Of the Forces of GREAT BRITAIN,</p>
                  <p>The Duke led to the Field the Army of the Allies. He took with ſurpriſing Rapidity <hi>Venlo, Ruremonde, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſwaert</hi> and <hi>Liege.</hi> He extended and ſecured the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0141100402:236"/>
of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The Enemies, whom he found inſulting at the Gates of <hi>Nimeghen,</hi> were driven to ſeek for Shelter behind their Lines. He forced <hi>Bonne, Huy, Limburgh,</hi> in another Campaign. He opened the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as well as the <hi>Maes.</hi> He added all the Country between theſe Rivers to his former Conqueſts. The Army of <hi>France,</hi> favoured by the Defection of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> had penetrated into the Heart of the <hi>Empire.</hi> This mighty Body lay expoſed to immediate Ruin. In that memorable Criſis, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled Celerity, Secrecy, Order, from the <hi>Ocean</hi> to the <hi>Danube.</hi> He ſaw: He attacked: Nor ſtopped, but to conquer the Enemy. He forced the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> ſuſtained by the <hi>French,</hi> in their ſtrong Intrenchments at <hi>Schellenberg.</hi> He paſſed the <hi>Danube.</hi> A ſecond Royal Army, compoſed of the beſt Troops of <hi>France,</hi> was ſent to reinforce the firſt. That of the Confederates was divided. With one Part of it the Siege of <hi>Ingol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt</hi> was carried on. With the other the Duke gave Battle to the united Strength of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Bavaria.</hi> On the 2d Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1704, he gained a more glorious Victory than the Hiſtories of any Age can boaſt. The Heaps of Slain were dreadful Proofs of his Valour. A Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> whole Legions of <hi>French,</hi> his Priſoners, proclaimed his Mercy. <hi>Bavaria</hi> was ſubdued, <hi>Ratisbon, Augsbourg, Ulm, Meminghen,</hi> all the Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Enemy, were recovered. The Liberty of the <hi>Diet,</hi> the Peace of the <hi>Empire,</hi> were reſtored. From the <hi>Danube,</hi> the Duke turned his victorious Arms towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Moſelle. Landau, Treves, Traerbach,</hi> were taken. In the Courſe of one Campaign the very Nature of the War was changed. The Invaders of other States were reduced to defend their own. The Frontier of <hi>France</hi> was expoſed in its weakeſt Part to the Efforts of the Allies.</p>
                  <p>That he might improve this Advantage, that he might puſh the Sum of Things to a ſpeedy Deciſion, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops early in the following Year once more to the <hi>Moſelle.</hi> They, whom he had ſaved a few Months before, neglected to ſecond
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0141100402:237"/>
him now. They, who might have been his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Conqueſt, refuſed to join him. When he ſaw the generous Deſigns he had formed, fruſtrated by private Intereſt, by Pique, by Jealouſy, he returned with Speed to the <hi>Maes.</hi> He returned; and Fortune and Victory returned with him. <hi>Liege</hi> was relieved; <hi>Huy</hi> retaken. The <hi>French,</hi> who had preſſed the Army of the <hi>States-General</hi> with ſuperior Numbers, retired behind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, which they deemed impregnable. The Duke forced theſe Intrenchments, with inconſiderable Loſs, on the 7th Day of <hi>July</hi> 1705, He defeated a great Part of the Army which defended them. The reſt eſcaped by a precipitate Retreat. If Advantages proportionable to this Succeſs were not immediately obtained, let the Failure be aſcribed to that Misfortune which attends moſt Confederacies; a Diviſion of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, where one alone ſhould judge; a Diviſion of Power, where one alone ſhould command. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment itſelf did Honour to the Duke. It became the Wonder of Mankind how he could do ſo much under thoſe Reſtraints, which had hindred him from doing more.</p>
                  <p>Powers more abſolute were given him afterwards. The Increaſe of his Powers multiplied his Victories. At the opening of the next Campaign, when all his Army was not yet aſſembled; when it was hardly known, that he had taken the Field; the Noiſe of his Triumphs was heard over <hi>Europe.</hi> On the 12th of <hi>May</hi> 1706, he attacked the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Ramillies.</hi> In the Space of Two Hours the whole Army was put to Flight. The Vigour and Conduct, with which he improved this Succeſs, were equal to thoſe, wherewith he gained it. <hi>Louvain, Bruſſels, Malines, Liere, Ghent, Oudenard, Antwerp, Damme, Bruges, Courtray,</hi> ſurrendered. <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, Menin, Dendermond</hi> and <hi>Aeth,</hi> were taken. <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> were recovered. Places which had reſiſted the greateſt Generals for Months, for Years; Provinces diſputed for Ages; were the Conqueſts of a Summer. Nor was the Duke content to triumph alone. Solicitous for the general Intereſt, his Care
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0141100402:238"/>
extended to the remoteſt Scenes of the War. He choſe to leſſen his own Army, that he might enable the Leaders of other Armies to conquer. To this it muſt be aſcribed that <hi>Turin</hi> was relieved; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> reinſtated; the <hi>French</hi> driven with Confuſion out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Victories gave the Confederates an Opportunity of carrying on the War on every Side into the Dominions of <hi>France.</hi> But ſhe continu'd to enjoy a kind of peaceful Neutrality in <hi>Germany.</hi> From <hi>Italy</hi> ſhe was once alarm'd, and had no more to fear. The intire Reduction of his Power, whoſe Ambition had cauſed, whoſe Strength ſupported the War, ſeemed reſerved for him alone, who had ſo triumphantly begun the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work.</p>
                  <p>The Barrier of <hi>France,</hi> on the Side of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> had been forming for more than half a Century. What Art, Power, Expence could do, had been done to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it impenetrable. Yet here ſhe was moſt expoſed; for here the Duke of MARLBOROUGH threatened to attack her.</p>
                  <p>To cover what they had gained by Surprize, or had been yielded to them by Treachery, the <hi>French</hi> marched to the Banks of the <hi>Schelde.</hi> At their Head were the Princes of the Blood, and their moſt fortunate General the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme.</hi> Thus commanded, thus poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they hoped to check the Victor in his Courſe. Vain were their Hopes. The Duke of MARLBOROUGH paſſed the River in their Sight. He defeated their whole Army. The Approach of Night concealed, the Proximity of <hi>Ghent</hi> favoured their Flight. They neglected nothing to repair their Loſs, to defend their Frontier. New Generals, new Armies appeared in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> All contributed to inhance the Glory, none were able to retard the Progreſs, of the confederate Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liſle,</hi> the Bulwark of this Barrier, was beſieged. A nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Gariſon, and a Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> defended the Place. Prince EUGENE of <hi>Savoy</hi> commanded, the Duke of MARLBOROUGH covered and ſuſtained the Siege. The Rivers were ſeized, and the Communication with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0141100402:239"/>
                     <hi>Holland</hi> interrupted. The Duke opened new Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications with great Labour, and much greater Art. Through Countries over-run by the Enemy, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Convoys arriv'd in Safety. One alone was attacked. The Troops which attacked it were beat. The Defence of <hi>Liſle</hi> was animated by Aſſurances of Relief.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> aſſembled all their Force. They marched towards the Town. The Duke of MARLBOROUGH offered them Battle, without ſuſpending the Siege. They abandoned the Enterprize. They came to ſave the Town. They were Spectators of its Fall.</p>
                  <p>From this Conqueſt the Duke haſtened to others. The Poſts taken by the Enemy on the <hi>Schelde</hi> were ſurpriſed. That River was paſſed the ſecond time, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Preparations made to prevent it, without Oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> beſieged by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was relieved. <hi>Ghent</hi> ſurrendered to the Duke in the Middle of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remarkably ſevere. An Army, little inferior to his own, marched out of the Place.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Seaſon of the Year permitted him to open another Campaign, the Duke beſieged and took <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay.</hi> He inveſted <hi>Mons.</hi> Near this City, the <hi>French</hi> Army, covered by thick Woods, defended by noble Intrenchments, waited to moleſt, nor preſumed to offer Battle. Even this was not attempted by them with Impunity. On the laſt Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1709, the Duke attacked them in their Camp. All was employed; nothing availed againſt the Reſolution of ſuch a General, againſt the Fury of ſuch Troops. The Battle was bloody. The Event deciſive. The Woods were pierced. The Fortifications trampled down. The Enemy fled. The Town was taken. <hi>Doway, Bethune, Aire, St. Venant, Bouchain,</hi> underwent the ſame Fate in Two ſucceeding Years. Their vigorous Reſiſtance could not ſave them. The Army of <hi>France</hi> durſt not attempt to relieve them. It ſeemed preſerved to defend the Capital of the Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>The Proſpect of this extreme Diſtreſs was neither diſtant nor dubious. The <hi>French</hi> acknowleged their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, and ſued for Peace.</p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0141100402:240"/>Theſe are the Actions of the late Duke of MARLBOROUGH,<lb/>Performed in the Compaſs of a few Years,<lb/>Sufficient to adorn the Annals of Ages.<lb/>The Admiration of other Nations<lb/>Will be conveyed to lateſt Poſterity,<lb/>In the Hiſtories even of the Enemies of BRITAIN.<lb/>The Senſe which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation had<lb/>Of his tranſcendent Merit,<lb/>Was expreſſed<lb/>In the moſt ſolemn, moſt effectual, moſt durable manner.<lb/>The Acts of Parliament <note n="*" place="bottom">Several Recitals of Clauſes in Acts of Parliament made to do Honour to this immortal Commander, are engraven on the ſame ſuperb Pillar.</note> inſcribed on this Pillar<lb/>Shall ſtand<lb/>As long as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Name and Language laſt,<lb/>Illuſtrious Monuments<lb/>Of MARLBOROUGH's Glory,<lb/>And<lb/>Of BRITAIN's Gratitude.</q>

            <p>At <hi>Woodſtock</hi> they make the fine Steel Chains for Watches, and other Things of poliſh'd Steel.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Woodſtock</hi> I went North-weſt to <hi>Chipping-Norton,</hi> which muſt have been once a Town of great Trade, by the Number of Merchants, as they are called on the Braſſes over their Monuments; and beſides, the Name <hi>Chipping</hi> denotes as much. There are Marks of a Caſtle by the Church; and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins are frequently found here. The Church is a good Building, and after a curious Model.</p>
            <p>Hence we rode to ſee <hi>Rowldrich</hi> Stones, a little <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> being a Circle of great Stones ſtanding upright, ſome of them from Five to Seven Feet high, and probably the <hi>Veſtigia</hi> of an old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Temple, as that was; and Mr. <hi>Toland</hi> poſitively aſſerts, that they were ſo.</p>

            <p>When I was at <hi>Banbury,</hi> I ſhould have mentioned <hi>Bloxham,</hi> which lies North of it; where is a fine Church, the Steeple of an odd, but agreeable Make.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Bloxham,</hi> is alſo the famous Pariſh of <hi>Bright-well,</hi> of which it was obſerved, that there had not been an Alehouſe, nor a Diſſenter from the Church, nor any Quarrel among the Inhabitants, that roſe ſo high as to a Suit of Law, within the Memory of Man. But they could not ſay it was ſo ſtill, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the Alehouſe Part; tho' very much is ſtill preſerved as to the Unity and good Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Pariſhioners, and their Conformity to the Church.</p>
            <p>Being now on the Side of <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> as is ſaid before, I ſtill went South, and paſſing by the <hi>Four Shire Stones,</hi> we ſaw where the Counties of <hi>Oxford, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> join all in a Point; one Stone ſtanding in each County, and the fourth touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Three.</p>
            <p>Entering <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> here, Weſtward, we came, after a Mile's Ride, to <hi>Moretonhenmarſh,</hi> a ſmall Town which had formerly a Market, but now diſcontinued: it lies on the great Road to <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And the famous <hi>Roman</hi> Foſſeway, which coming out of <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> enters this County at <hi>Lemington,</hi> which lies North-eaſt of this Town, ſtrikes thro' it, and alſo thro' <hi>Stow</hi> and <hi>North-Leach,</hi> down to <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> Southward.</p>
            <p>Hence we come to the famous <hi>Cotſwold-downs,</hi> ſo eminent for the beſt of Sheep, and fineſt Wool in <hi>England:</hi> Fame tells us, that ſome of theſe Sheep were ſent by King <hi>Richard</hi> I. into <hi>Spain,</hi> and that from hence the Breed of their Sheep was raiſed, which now produce ſo fine a Wool, that we are obliged to fetch it from thence at a great Price, for making our fineſt Broad Cloaths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0141100402:242"/>Upon theſe Downs we had a clear View of the afore-mentioned famous <hi>Foſſe,</hi> which evidently croſſes all the Middle Part of <hi>England,</hi> and is to be ſeen and known (tho' in no Place plainer than here) quite from the <hi>Bath</hi> to <hi>Warwick,</hi> and thence to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> to <hi>Newark,</hi> to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and on to <hi>Barton,</hi> upon the Bank of <hi>Humber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We obſerved alſo how ſeveral croſs Roads as antient as the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> join'd it, or branched out of it; ſome of which the People have by antient Uſage, tho' corruptly, called alſo <hi>Foſſes:</hi> For Example,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ackmanſtreet,</hi> which is an antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Road, leading from <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> thro' <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> to the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Bath</hi>; this joins the <hi>Foſſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Burford</hi> and <hi>Cirenceſter.</hi> Alſo <hi>Grimes-dyke,</hi> from <hi>Oxfordſhire, Wattle-bank,</hi> or <hi>Aves-ditch,</hi> from the ſame, and the <hi>Would-way,</hi> call'd alſo the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> croſſing from <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to <hi>Cirenceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Seats of the Nobility are to be found in theſe Parts; <hi>Cornbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s; <hi>Ditchley,</hi> Lord <hi>Litchfield</hi>'s; <hi>Hathorp,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Shrewſbury</hi>'s, new built of Stone very beautifully.</p>

Of which Town more by-and-by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stow on the Would,</hi> which is the next Town we came to, is but indifferent to look at; but is, or rather has been, remarkable for its Two annual Fairs, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Hops, Cheeſe, and Sheep, of which, 'tis ſaid, that above 20,000 are generally ſold at one Fair, and that the Toll of theſe Fairs and the Markets, amount to 80<hi>l.</hi> a Year. The Pariſh is very large, being 12 Miles in Compaſs, and conſiſts of Meadow,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0141100402:243"/>
Arable, and Paſture. Here is a good large Rectory Church ſtanding on a Hill, with a high Tower on the South-ſide of it, which is ſeen a great Diſtance off. Here is alſo an Hoſpital, Alms-houſe, and Free-ſchool, all well endow'd; beſides other Charities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Northleche</hi> is alſo a Market-town, governed by a Bailiff and Two Conſtables, and is named from the River <hi>Leche,</hi> which runs through it. Here is a Vicarage Church, large and ſpacious, having Ayles on each Side, and handſome Windows, with a large Tower. Here is a Grammar-ſchool, free for all the Boys of the Town, endow'd with 80<hi>l.</hi> a Year. And 'tis ſaid, that the Founder, falling afterwards into Misfortunes, ſolicited for the Maſter's Place of his own School, but could not obtain it from the Truſtees.</p>
            <p>Here we quitted the <hi>Roman Foſſe,</hi> and went Eaſt-ward to <hi>Burford</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> II. gave this Town a Charter, <hi>Guildam &amp; omnes conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudines, quas habent liberi Burgenſes de Oxenford</hi>; but they are almoſt all now loſt: however it retains ſome Marks of a Corporation ſtill, being governed by Two Bailiffs, and other inferior Officers. It is famous for Saddles, and, lying near the Downs, draws great Profit from the Horſe-races, which are frequent here. At this Place was convened a Synod in 685, againſt the Error of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches in the Obſervance of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Battle-edge,</hi> near this Town, <hi>Cuthred,</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> beat <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> in a pitch'd Battle, and threw off his Yoke. The Inhabitants celebrate yearly, on <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer-eve,</hi> a kind of Feſtival, which, they ſay, commenced in Honour of this Battle. It was here the learned Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> (deſcended originally from an antient Family in <hi>Wales</hi>) was born; and the famous Speaker <hi>Lenthal</hi> had a Seat, and died here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0141100402:244"/>Being ſo near <hi>Witney,</hi> we could not forbear taking a Ride to ſee a Town ſo famous for the Manufactures of Blanketing and Rugs, which thrive here in a moſt extraordinary manner. Here are at work 150 Looms continually, for which above 3000 People, from Eight Years old and upward, are daily imploy'd in Carding, Spinning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conſume above 100 Packs of Wool weekly. The Blankets are uſually 10 or 12 Quarters wide, and very white, which ſome attribute to the abſterſive nitrous Waters of the River <hi>Windruſh,</hi> wherewith they are ſcoured; but others believe it is owing to a peculiar way of looſe Spinning they uſe here; and others again are of Opinion, that it proceeds from both. But however that be, this Town has engroſſed the whole Trade in that Commodity, and increaſes daily in its Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They likewiſe make here the <hi>Duffield</hi> Stuffs, a Yard and three Quarters wide, which are carried to <hi>New England</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> and now much worn even here in Winter. Here are likewiſe a great many Fellmongers, who having dreſſed and ſtained their Sheep-ſkins, make them into Jackets and Breeches, and ſell them at <hi>Bampton</hi>; from whence they are diſperſed all over the neighbouring Counties. Here is a good Free-ſchool, and a fine Library be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Witney</hi> is an antient Town, and of good Repute before the Conqueſt; but it is a long, ſtraggling, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth Place, tho' full of Inhabitants. 'Twas one of the Manors which <hi>Alwinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> gave to the Church of <hi>St. Swithin</hi>'s there, on Queen <hi>Emma</hi>'s happily paſſing over the <hi>Fire Ordeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Aſtal,</hi> a Village in the Road between <hi>Burford</hi> and <hi>Witney,</hi> is a Barrow which ſtands very high, and is ſuppoſed to be the Sepulchre of ſome Perſon of great Note.</p>
            <p>Southward lies <hi>Bampton,</hi> on the Borders of the County next <hi>Berkſhire.</hi> It is an antient Market-town,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0141100402:245"/>
likewiſe in Repute before the Conqueſt: it is noted for the greateſt Market for Fellmonger-wares in <hi>England,</hi> which come from <hi>Witney,</hi> and for nothing elſe that I know of, ſaving that the People talk'd much of a Family of the <hi>Woods</hi> (that dwelt here and at <hi>Briſenorton</hi>) who hear always a great Knocking before any of them die.</p>
            <p>Turning here Weſt, we enter'd <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> again, and came to <hi>Lechlade,</hi> which lies on the great Road to <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> It is probable, that it was antiently a <hi>Roman</hi> Town upon the <hi>Thames</hi>; for a very plain <hi>Roman</hi> Road runs from hence to <hi>Cirenceſter.</hi> Some ſay, that it was once a famous Univerſity for teaching <hi>Latin,</hi> as <hi>Creeklade</hi> was for <hi>Greek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The antient Building lately diſcovered by digging in a Meadow near <hi>Lechlade,</hi> deſerves a particular Mention: it is 50 Feet long, 40 broad, and Four high; ſupported with 100 Brick Pillars, curiouſly inlaid with Stones of divers Colours, of Teſſeraick Work; and ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Bath.</p>
            <p>Not far from it are the Two Towns called <hi>Sarney</hi>; ſo named, in <hi>Britiſh,</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſways; for <hi>Sarn,</hi> in that antient Language, and at preſent, imports a paved Way. The River <hi>Lech</hi> runs thro' it, and diſcharges itſelf into the <hi>Thames.</hi> A great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Barges go from hence to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Lechlade</hi> we proceeded Weſt to <hi>Fairford,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, thro' which runs the River <hi>Coln,</hi> which has Two large Bridges over it. A great many Medals and Urns have been often dug up here, and there are ſeveral Barrows in the adjoining Fields, (which ſeem to have been a Scene of warlike Actions) the Monuments of the Slain interred here.</p>
            <p>A great many Charities are ſtill ſubſiſting in this Town; but what it is moſt noted for is its Church, and the admirable Painting in its Windows: of which take the following Deſcription and Hiſtory.</p>

(to whom it deſcended from the <hi>Beauchamps,</hi> Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi>) and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken a Prize-ſhip bound for <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he found a great Quantity of painted Glaſs, he brought both the Glaſs and the Workmen into <hi>England.</hi> The Glaſs was ſuch a Curioſity, that Mr. <hi>Tame</hi> built this Church at <hi>Fairford</hi> (dedicating it to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>); which is in Length 125 Feet, and 55 in Breadth; and has Three Chancels, a good Veſtry, and a noble Tower, ariſing from the Midſt of it, adorned with Pinacles; and the Windows of the Church, 28 in Number, he cauſed to be glazed with this invaluable Prize, which remains intire to this Day, the Admiration of all that ſee it.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Farmer</hi> (a Daughter of the Lord <hi>Lemſter</hi>) gave 200<hi>l.</hi> to be laid out in mending and wiring the Windows: this has preſerved them from Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And in the grand Rebellion, the Impropriator Mr. <hi>Oldworth,</hi> and others, (to their great Praiſe be it remembred) took down the Glaſs, and ſecured it in ſome ſecret Place, thereby preſerving it from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Rage. The Painting was the Deſign of <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> a famous <hi>Italian</hi> Maſter; and the Colouring in the Drapery, and ſome of the Figures, is ſo well perform'd, that <hi>Vandyke</hi> affirmed, the Pencil could not exceed it.</p>
            <p>The Subject is all Scripture Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent tempting <hi>Eve</hi>; God appearing in the burning Buſh to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when a Shepherd; the Angel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting <hi>Joſhua</hi> to War; <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Fleece; the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi>'s Viſit to <hi>Solomon</hi>; King <hi>David</hi> judging the <hi>Amalekite</hi> Regicide; <hi>Samſon</hi> ſlaying the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> killing the Lion, and his being betray'd by <hi>Dalilah</hi>; <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Judgment between the Two Harlots; and the Figures of the Twelve Major Prophets.</p>

               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0141100402:247"/>But the greateſt Part is taken up with Stories of the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> The Angel appearing to <hi>Zacharias</hi>; <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> contracted; the Viſitation of <hi>Mary</hi> by the Angel, and her viſiting her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; our Saviour born in a Stable; the Shepherds and <hi>Magi</hi> viſiting him there; <hi>Herod</hi> waiting the Return of the wiſe Men; Chriſt circumciſed; the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Holy Virgin; <hi>Simeon</hi> with our Saviour in his Arms; <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Flight into <hi>Egypt</hi>; <hi>Herod</hi> ſlaying the young Children of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; the Aſſumption of the Virgin, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> and her ſeeking Jeſus at the Feaſt: our Saviour's Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Mary</hi> anointing his Head: the Diſciples going to embalm him, and the Angel relating to them his Reſurrection; Chriſt's Appearance to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>; his riding to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on an Aſs; <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> and the People ſtrewing Palm-branches, and Children crying <hi>Hoſanna</hi>; his Praying in the Garden; <hi>Judas</hi> betraying him; <hi>Pilate</hi> judging him, and waſhing his Hands from the Guilt; the Crucifixion between two Thieves, the Women ſtanding by, and the Soldiers watching him; <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> begging the Body, and receiving it; his Burial by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and others; the Darkneſs at the Paſſion, and <hi>Michael</hi> contending with the Devil.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's travelling to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and his Appearance to the Eleven, and afterwards to <hi>Thomas</hi>; the Diſciples going a Fiſhing, and Chriſt's appearing to them, with the breaking of the Net, and broiling of the Fiſh; Chriſt's Aſcenſion, and the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt in cloven Tongues.</p>
            <p>In the Weſt Window is the Laſt Judgment curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſigned, and well executed, containing a vaſt Number of Incidents relating thereto.</p>
            <p>In the reſt of the Windows are many hiſtorical Paſſages, that happened after Chriſt's Aſcenſion; <hi>viz.</hi> The Twelve Apoſtles at large, with the Article of the Creed they are ſaid to be ſeverally the Authors of;

the Four Evangeliſts, as writing the Goſpels; Four principal Fathers of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>; the Worthies that have preſerved the Chriſtian Church, in four Upper-windows of the Middle Ayle on the South Side, and the Perſecutors thereof in the four oppoſite Windows.</p>
            <p>I have been as brief as poſſible in this Deſcription, being ſo much confined in my Limits; but a curious Traveller will be highly delighted with this noble Work. And I ſhall only add, That <hi>John Tame,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the pious and worthy Founder, who died in the Year 1500, lies buried on the North Side of the Church, under a raiſed Marble Monument.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Churn,</hi> one of the Rivers I have juſt named, ſtands <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> (or <hi>Ciceſter,</hi> for Brevity) the antient <hi>Corinium</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſaid to be rebuilt by <hi>Ciſſa,</hi> a Viceroy under one of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, a great and populous City; then incloſed with Walls and a Ditch of vaſt Compaſs, which may be traced quite round. The Foundation of the Wall is alſo very viſible in moſt Places. A good Part of this Circuit is now Paſture, Corn Fields, and Gardens, beſides the Scite of the preſent Town. Antiquities are dug up here every Day; old Foundations, Houſes and Streets, and many <hi>Moſaick</hi> Pavements with Rings, Intaglia's, and Coins innumerable, eſpecially in one great Garden called <hi>Lewis Grounds,</hi> which might have been the <hi>Praetorium</hi> or General's Quarters; for <hi>Llys,</hi> in <hi>Britiſh,</hi> ſignifies a Palace. Large Quantities of carved Stones are carried off yearly in Carts, to mend the Highways, beſides what have been uſed in Building. A fine <hi>Moſaick</hi> Pavement was dug up here <hi>Anno</hi> 1723, with many Coins. One Mr. <hi>Richard Biſhop</hi> lately dug up in his Garden a Vault 16 Feet long, and 12 broad, ſupported with ſquare Pillars of <hi>Roman</hi> Brick, three Feet and an half high, on which was a ſtrong Floor of Terrace.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0141100402:249"/>
Near it are now ſeveral other Vaults, on which Cherry-trees grow. Theſe might have been the Foundations of a Temple; for in the ſame Place they found ſeveral Stones of the Shafts of Pillars Six Feet long, and large Stone Baſes, with Cornices very handſomely moulded, and carved with Modilions and other Ornaments, which are now converted into Swine-troughs, and Pavements before the Door. Capitals of theſe Pillars were likewiſe found. A <hi>Moſaick</hi> Pavement near it, and intire, is now the Floor of his Privy.</p>
            <p>Half a Mile Weſt of the Town, on the North Side of the <hi>Foſſe</hi> Road, at a Place called <hi>Quern,</hi> other Antiquities are to be ſeen worth an Antiquary's Attention; but I muſt not take up too much Room in deſcribing them.</p>
            <p>Little of the Abbey is now leſt, beſides Two old and indifferent Gate-houſes. The Church is a very handſome Building; the Windows are full of painted Glaſs; and it has a fine lofty Tower. Eaſt of the Town, about a Quarter of a Mile, is <hi>Starbury Mount,</hi> a Barrow, where <hi>Roman</hi> Coins have been dug up. Weſt, behind Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi>'s Garden, is <hi>Griſmund</hi>'s <hi>Mount,</hi> of which ſeveral Fables are told.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> is ſtill a very good Town, populous and rich, full of Clothiers, and driving a great Trade in Wool, which is brought from the Inland Counties of <hi>Leiceſter, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where the largeſt Sheep in <hi>England</hi> feed, and where are but few Manufactures. The vaſt Quantities ſold here are almoſt incredible. The Wool is bought up here, chiefly by the Clothiers of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> for the Supply of that great Cloathing-trade, which I have mentioned already: they talk of 5000 Packs in a Year.</p>
            <p>The Town is governed by Two High Conſtables. It has Two weekly Markets; one on <hi>Monday,</hi> for Corn, Cattle, and Proviſions; and on <hi>Friday,</hi> for
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0141100402:250"/>
Wool chiefly. It has alſo Five Fairs, Three for all Sorts of Commodities, and Two for Cloth only. Here is a fine large beautiful Church with Two Ayles, ſupported by ſtrong Pillars. The Chancel is handſomely decorated. It has Five Chapels adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and has a Tower very neat and lofty, with an excellent Ring of Bells in it. The Windows ſhew ſome beautiful Remains of exquiſite painted Glaſs. There is a Free-ſchool, and divers Hoſpitals and Alms-houſes in this Pariſh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Churn</hi> runs from hence down Southward to <hi>Creeklade</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> which is ſaid to have been antiently a very noted Place, containing 1300 Houſes, and that an Univerſity was here founded by the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> for teaching <hi>Greek,</hi> as I have ſaid, as <hi>Lech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi> was for <hi>Latin</hi>; which Univerſity was removed, as they pretend, by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> to <hi>Oxon:</hi> but, I doubt, theſe are Monkiſh Accounts; for <hi>Creeklade,</hi> which they would have to ſignify a <hi>Greek</hi> Town, is a Corruption of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Kerigg gwlade,</hi> i. e. a ſtony Country. The <hi>Churn</hi> and the <hi>Rey</hi> fall, here, into the <hi>Thames.</hi> Here is a good Free-ſchool.</p>
            <p>North-weſt of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> upon a Hill, ſtands <hi>Stroud,</hi> a little Market-town, noted for Clothing, and particularly for dying excellent Scarlet. The Church is 90 Feet long, and 40 broad. The Chancel is 33 Feet long, and 16 wide. At the Weſt End of the Church riſes a high Spire Steeple, and a Tower in the Middle.</p>
            <p>North of it ſtands <hi>Paynſwick,</hi> a Market-town, ſituate in the wholſomeſt Air in the County, on the River <hi>Stroud,</hi> where the Cloathing-trade is alſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on. The Church is a Vicarage, and very handſome, with Two Chancels, a North Ayle, and a neat Spire.</p>
            <p>Lower to the South-weſt of <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> ſtands <hi>Minching Hampton</hi>; ſo called, becauſe it belonged to the <hi>Minching</hi> Nuns at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi> Here
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0141100402:251"/>
is a good Rectory Church worth 200<hi>l.</hi> a Year, large, in the Form of a Croſs with Ayles on each Side, and a Tower with Battlements riſing in the Middle. In the North Ayle are a great many Inſcriptions of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactions. And in the South Ayle is a Statue lying croſs-legg'd, with a Sword and Shield by him, and his Wife lying at his Feet.</p>
            <p>Then we came to <hi>Tetbury,</hi> one of the Cloathing Towns I mentioned; a conſiderable Market-town, ſituate on a riſing Ground, in a healthy Air, but ſcarce of Water in Summer. 'Tis well-built, has a large Market-houſe well frequented for Yarn; and there is a leſſer Market-houſe, for Cheeſe, Bacon, and other Commodities. 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff, and at the End of the Town is a long Bridge, whereof one half is in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> The Church is a Vicarage, worth 120<hi>l.</hi> a Year: 'tis a good Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, large and handſome, in which are divers Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Here is a Free-ſchool and an Alms-houſe. It had formerly a Caſtle built by <hi>Dunwallo Malmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince. The Town ſeems to be well furniſhed with every thing but Water, which is ſo ſcarce, that the Inhabitants are obliged to buy it at the Rate ſometimes of 18<hi>d.</hi> for a Hogſhead. In this Pariſh riſes the River <hi>Avon,</hi> which runs thro' <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and afterwards falls into the <hi>Severn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little to the North of this Town is a Meadow called <hi>Maudlin</hi> Meadow, becauſe, as I was told, it belongs to <hi>Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Here the Inhabitants ſhewed me the Head of a Spring, which flowing from thence runs along a Hedge-trough, and ſome Tops of the Wood, that grows in the Hedge, rotting, and falling into this Rill of Water, are, by it, turned into Stone. I took up a great many of them, which are generally in the Shape of the Pipes (as they are commonly called) which the Peruke-makers curl their Hair upon, and of a whitiſh ſtony Subſtance. I broke divers of them, and in the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0141100402:252"/>
middle found generally a Stick of Wood, ſome as big as a Gooſe-quill, others larger; ſome had but a thin ſtony Cruſt about them, in others the Stick was no biggar than a large Needle: again, ſome had no Stick in them, but only a Hole thro' them, like that of a Tobacco Pipe; and in ſome others, I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no woody Subſtance, nor Hole at all, but the Whole was a ſoft Kind of Stone.—Hence I gueſs, that the Sand which the Water brings down with it, gathers and cruſts about thoſe Sticks; and that, in time, the Stick conſumes, and the ſtony or ſandy Subſtance fills up and ſupplies its Place. And I would hence recommend it as an Inquiry, Whether thoſe other Tranſmutations of this Kind, that we meet with in the Natural Hiſtory of this and other Nations, be not brought about in the like manner.</p>
            <p>And now I am dipp'd into this Work of Nature, let me digreſs a little, and take notice of the <hi>Aſtroites,</hi> or Star-ſtones, found at <hi>Laſſington</hi> in this County, which have that peculiar Quality of Motion when put into Vinegar.—In the Fields, near <hi>Badminton,</hi> are found cylindrical and ſpherical Stones, almoſt as big as Cannon Balls. And on the Hills about <hi>Aldely,</hi> are found Stones of the ſame Kind with thoſe I found about <hi>Watchet</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> reſembling all Kinds of Shell-fiſh: theſe, I muſt confeſs, are, of the two, more aſtoniſhing, becauſe they are found on the Hills; for if they were, as <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> conjectures, Animals ingendered in the Sea, no good Account of their being here found can be given, unleſs we ſuppoſe them brought hither by the general Deluge.—The Water of the River <hi>Stroud,</hi> in this County, is eſteemed the beſt for Dying Scarlets, which draws many Clothiers to ſettle in that Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. And leſt I ſhould be thought too tedious, let me but juſt mention the Diamonds (<hi>Briſtol</hi> Stones rather) found near the Banks of the River <hi>Avon.</hi> That ſoft, eaſy-to-be-wrought Stone at <hi>Great Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0141100402:253"/>
called <hi>Puff-ſtone,</hi> prodigiouſly ſtrong and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a great deal af of which hath been uſed in the Repairs of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wickwar,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, but a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Corporation, governed by a Mayor, is the next. The Church is a large Edifice, with Two Chancels. The Tower is at the Weſt End, and is high, adorn'd with Pinacles. Here is a Free-ſchool.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chipping Sodbury</hi> lies a little farther in the Road, an antient Borough-town, under a Mayor, Aldermen and Burgeſſes. As it is a great Thorough-fare to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> it is full of good Inns. It has ſeveral Streets beſides Lanes, and a good Market; and a large ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Church, which, however, is but a Chapel of Eaſe to <hi>Old Sodbury.</hi> Here is the greateſt Cheeſe-market in <hi>England,</hi> except <hi>Atherſtone</hi> in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we dropp'd the Road, and fell down South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, directly to <hi>Marſhfield,</hi> another of the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Towns I ſpoke of. It conſiſts of one Street of old Buildings near a Mile long. It has a Market, and drives alſo a great Trade in Malt, and is noted for good Cakes. 'Tis governed by a Bailiff. Here is a good Vicarage Church, with ſeveral Monuments and Inſcriptions in the Ayles, and the Chancel. Here is an Alms-houſe well endow'd, and a Chapel to it.</p>
            <p>We croſſed the great Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Briſtol</hi> here, as at <hi>Cirenceſter</hi> we did that from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Glouceſter</hi>; and keeping ſtill the Foſſeway, arrived at <hi>Bath.</hi> But here I ſhall conclude this Letter, and am, Sir,</p>

            <p>The Antiquity of this City, and of the famous Baths in it, muſt be allow'd to be very great, even tho' we ſhould doubt of what is inſiſted on in the Inſcription under the Figure of King <hi>Bladud,</hi> placed in the King's Bath, which ſays, that this Prince (whom Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls <hi>Blayden,</hi> or <hi>Bladen Cloyth,</hi> i. e. <hi>Southſayer</hi>) found out the Uſe of theſe Baths, 300 Years before our Saviour's Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bath</hi> is a Spot of Ground, which our Countrymen ought to eſteem as a particular Favour of Heaven. It lies in a great Valley, ſurrounded with an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatrical View of Hills; and its Situation on the Weſt Side of the Iſland is a conſiderable Addition to its Delights, as being the leſs liable to the rude Shocks of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0141100402:255"/>
Tempeſts. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were induced prudently to make a Station here by the admirable hot Springs. The Walls are almoſt intire, and perhaps the Work of the <hi>Romans,</hi> except the upper Part, which ſeems repaired with the Ruins of <hi>Roman</hi> Buildings; for the Lewis-holes are ſtill left in many of the Stones, and, to the Shame of the Repairers, many <hi>Roman</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, ſome ſawn acroſs, to fit the Size of the Place. The Level of the City is riſen to the Top of the firſt Walls, thro' the Negligence of the Magiſtracy, who, in this, and all other great Towns, connive at the Servants throwing Dirt and Aſhes into the Streets. Theſe Walls incloſe but a ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, of a pentagonal Form. There are four Gates on four Sides, and a Poſtern on the other. From the South-weſt Angle have been an additional Wall and Ditch carried out to the River; by which ſhort Work the Approach of an Enemy on two Sides is intercepted, unleſs they paſs the River. The ſmall Compaſs of the City has made the Inhabitants croud up the Streets to an unſeemly and inconvenient Narrowneſs. It is, however, handſomely built, moſtly of new Stone, which is very white and good. The great Additions made, and ſtill making, to the Buildings here, I ſhall mention by-and-by.</p>
            <p>It was of old a Reſort for Cripples, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Perſons; and we ſee the Crutches hang up at the ſeveral Baths, as the Thank-offerings of thoſe who came hither lame, and went away cured. But now we may ſay it is a Reſort of the Sound, as well as the Sick, and a Place that helps the Indolent and the Gay to commit that worſt of Murders, that is to ſay, to kill <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuch it is indeed a conſtant Round of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In the Morning the young Lady is brought in a cloſe Chair, dreſſed in her Bathing-cloaths, to the <hi>Croſs-bath.</hi> There the Muſick plays her into the Bath, and the Women who tend her, preſent her
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0141100402:256"/>
with a little floating Wooden Diſh, like a Baſon; in which the Lady puts a Handkerchief, and a Noſegay, and of late the Snuff-box is added. She then traverſes the Bath, if a Novice, with a Guide; if otherwiſe, by herſelf; and having amus'd herſelf near an Hour, calls for her Chair, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to her Lodgings.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Diverſion is at Mrs. <hi>Hayes</hi>'s, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Harriſon</hi>'s, a ſtately Room, and Mrs. <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>'s, who has now the Apartments that were the late Mrs. <hi>Lindſey</hi>'s, where not long ſince was the Bowling-green. And perhaps Mr. <hi>Leake,</hi> who keeps one of the fineſt Bookſellers Shops in <hi>Europe,</hi> has more than a Chance for half an Hour of each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Company now-and-then, and to be ſure a Subſcription, which is but five Shillings the Seaſon, for taking home what Book you pleaſe; but Perſons of Quality generally ſubſcribe Gold, and I think it is the very beſt Money laid out in the Place, for thoſe who go for Pleaſure or Amuſement only. In the Afternoon there is frequently a Play, tho' the Decorations are mean, and indeed the Performances too. In the Evening, People aſſemble at the great Rooms, and there are Balls twice a Week. 'Tis alſo the Faſhion of the Place, for the Company to go every Day pretty conſtantly to hear Divine Service at the great Church, and at <hi>St. Mary</hi>'s Chapel in <hi>Queen's-ſquare,</hi> where are Prayers twice a Day.</p>
            <p>'Tis remarkable that for many Hundreds of Years, the Medicinal Virtues of theſe Waters have been uſeful to the diſeaſed People by Batheing only; whereas of late Years they are found to be no leſs healthful in many Caſes taken inwardly; inſomuch, that more come to drink than to bathe; nor are the Cures they perform this way, leſs valuable than the outward Application.</p>
            <p>Gaming uſed to obtain here, as at all publick Places, to a ſcandalous Degree; but the Act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0141100402:257"/>
that pernicious Practice; has a good deal checked its Progreſs. This Act paſſed in the 12th of King <hi>George</hi> II. and ſuppreſſes, on the Penalty of 200<hi>l.</hi> and 50<hi>l.</hi> the Adventures, the following Games by Name; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Ace of Hearts, Pharaoh, Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, Hazard</hi>; alſo all <hi>Sales, Raffles, Lotteries, Mathematical Machines,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sales by Lotteries</hi> are declared void, and what is put up by them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; nor are Convictions to be vacated for want of Form.</p>
            <p>But this Act being eluded by new Games ſet up, a Clauſe was inſerted in the <hi>Horſe-racing</hi> Act, <hi>Anno</hi> 13 <hi>Geo.</hi> II. prohibiting <hi>Paſſage,</hi> and all other Games with Dice, except what are play'd on the <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamon</hi> Tables.</p>
            <p>As to the more particular Nature and Virtues of the Waters, I have been favoured, by a very eminent Phyſician, with the following curious Account of tham, and their Original.<q>
                  <hi>Of</hi> Bath <hi>Waters.</hi>
                  <p>The <hi>Bath</hi> Waters certainly owe their Heat to a Mixture and Fermentation of two different Sources, diſtilling from the Tops of two different Mountains (<hi>Clarton</hi> and <hi>Landſdown</hi>) meeting in the Valley where the Town ſtands; for all Hills are Neſts of Metals or Minerals, and their Bellies are cavernous and hollow. It is not therefore improbable, that on <hi>Clarton Down</hi> there ſhould lie the ſulphurous Matter which muſt riſe by Impregnation from that excellent Stone Quarry, which hardens in the Air, and grows caſed with a nitrous Coat by Time, and cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is ſo readily cut out and carved into any the moſt exquiſite Shapes. This the Diſcovery and Property of the worthy, charitable, and pious <hi>Ralph Allen,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> For all Mineral Waters owe their Virtue to an Impregnation of Rain Water, generated from the Clouds, which are compreſſed in their Courſe by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0141100402:258"/>
Mountains or Eminences, and fall on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective included Mineral. And every one knows, that a due Mixture of Sulphur, and Filings of Iron, moiſtened with Water, will produce any Degree of Heat. This Quarry therefore muſt have a large Quantity of ſulphurous or bituminous Matter in its Compoſition, as will be evident to a Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, from theſe mentioned Qualities of the Stone. Neither is it improbable, that the ferruginous or iron-tinctured Water takes its Riſe from <hi>Lanſdown</hi> Quarry, the Stone on it being hard, and on the Top flinty, black, and acrimonious, as Iron Ore is known to be. Theſe Two Mountains, thus tinged by Rain Water falling from the proper Heights, meet in ſome Caverns in the Valley; and, there fermenting produce that hot, milky, ſoft, ſalutiferous Beverage, called <hi>Bath Water,</hi> far beyond any hot mineral Waters for its Delicacy, and ſupportable, tho' comfortable Heat, to any other ſuch Water hitherto diſcovered on the habitable Globe, as it poſſeſſes that Milkineſs, Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and middling Heat ſo friendly adapted to weaken'd animal Conſtitutions, which all other hot Waters want in the due Degree; either being too hot, or too cold, to do any great Good in Caſes where they are proper. Theſe Waters are beneficial in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all chronical Diſtempers, and can hurt in none, except in Hemorrhages, Inflammations, or bad Lungs, unleſs they be over-doſed in Quantity, or too high and too hot a Regimen be joined with them; for they always procure a great Appetite, and good Spirits, if cautiouſly managed; but if high Meats, and ſtrong Liquors, be indulged, they will create inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory Diſorders. However, in weak Stomachs, decayed Appetites, Colicks, low Spirits, in the Intervals of the Fits of the Gout and Stone; in Rheumatiſms, Palſies, nervous Diſorders; and, in a Word, all thoſe called the Cold Diſeaſes; but moſt eminently, in all the Diſorders of the chyliferous Tube,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0141100402:259"/>
or the Stomach and Belly not inflamed, they are more kindly and beneficial than any Medicine known in Nature; and introduce a natural Warmth, and a new internal Heat, into decayed, worn-out, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated Conſtitutions; and if a light Regimen, due Exerciſe, and good Hours, be joined with them, they would truly work Wonders: but by the Neglect of theſe, their Efficacy is often loſt, and their Credit brought into Queſtion.</p>

            <p>Great Additions have been made to the Buildings here within theſe few Years; particularly by the Duke of <hi>Chandos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without the Walls, a ſtately new Square is erected, with a fine Chapel, and the Middle is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by Rails, and handſomely laid out within.</p>
            <p>In the Centre is a lofty Obeliſk 70 Feet high from the Foundation, and terminated in a Point. Level with one's Eye is the incloſed Inſcription:

            <p>The <hi>Bath-ſtone,</hi> which I have mention'd before, affords a fine Opportunity to imbelliſh and give a noble Look to the Buildings here, and at a very cheap Rate; for the Front of the Houſes on the North Side of the Square coſt no more than 500<hi>l.</hi> tho' it is above 200 Feet in Extent, and inriched with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0141100402:260"/>
and Pilaſters in the <hi>Corinthian Order.</hi> All the Danger is, that they will over-build themſelves now they are got into the Humour, and make it leſs worth while to thoſe who let Lodgings, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Buſineſs of the Place; but then People of Fortune, ſettling there, will make amends for it; ſince no leſs than 70 or 80 Families are already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conſtant Inhabitants, and others are daily taking Houſes.</p>
            <p>The Grove too, near the Abbey-church, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Orange-ſquare,</hi> in Compliment to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when there, has ſeveral handſome new-built Houſes; and a monumental Stone is erected, with an Inſcription in Honour to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Place; his Highneſs having been obliged to viſit <hi>Bath</hi> for his Health, juſt before he married the Princeſs Royal of <hi>England,</hi> and received great Benefit by the Waters. This likewiſe was erected by the famous Mr. <hi>Naſh,</hi> to whoſe good Management and Behaviour <hi>Bath</hi> is greatly indebted; every one ſubmitting with Delight to the Regulations he impoſes, with regard to Decorum, and the Oeconomy of the Place.</p>
            <p>The Inſcription on the Stone above, is as follows:<q>

            </p>
            <p>General <hi>Wade,</hi> one of the Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for this City, has given a fine Altar-piece to the great Church there: He has alſo been at the Charge of having the Picture drawn of every one of his Electors, (the Members of the Corporation) and ſet up round the Town-hall; and his own too he has
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0141100402:261"/>
ſuffer'd to be put up over the Entrance, as if he would make good that Paſs, and keep them all to <hi>Duty.</hi> At the Upper-end of the Hall are lately ſet up the Pictures of the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Wales,</hi> a Preſent made by their Royal Highneſſes to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, who likewiſe before preſented it with a fine large wrought Silver Cup and Waiter, gilt.</p>
            <p>There is a very great Narrowneſs of Spirit in moſt of the Inhabitants at <hi>Bath:</hi> but, indeed, it is the ſame in all publick Places of Reſort. They have but their <hi>Seaſons</hi>; and they are ſo hungry by that time they come about, that they look upon a new Comer, as a Perſon to be <hi>ſhared</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> among them: for this Reaſon you'll always find them with <hi>both</hi> Hands open to <hi>receive</hi>; and not <hi>one</hi> to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> or do a <hi>generous</hi> Office, without a Benefit in <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> or <hi>Reverſion.</hi> And when they receive a Favour at your Hands, 'tis with ſuch an Air, as if it were their <hi>Due,</hi> and they quitted Scores with you by their Acceptance of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Abbey-church</hi> is a venerable Pile, and has many Monuments in it. But the principal Front is almoſt blaſphemouſly decorated, if it may be call'd decorated, with the Figures of God the Father, and Saints and Angels, the Work of Superſtition. This Cathedral, tho' beautiful, is but ſmall; and on the Spot probably ſtood the <hi>Roman</hi> Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> Patroneſs of the Baths. Before it, was an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſquare Area, but of late Years deformed with Houſes.</p>
            <p>On the South Side are the juſtly renowned hot Springs collected into a ſquare Area, called <hi>the King's Bath.</hi> The Corporation erected within theſe few Years that pretty neat Building before it, call'd <hi>the Pump-room,</hi> for the Company to meet in, who drink the Water, convey'd hither by a Marble Pump from the Bottom of the Springs, where it is near boiling-hot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0141100402:262"/>This Water is admirably grateful to the Stomach, ſtriking the Roof of the Mouth with a fine ſulphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſteely Taſte, like that of the <hi>German Spaw</hi> or <hi>Pyrmont.</hi> Tho' you drink off a large Pint-glaſs, it is ſo far from creating a Heavineſs or Nauſea, that you immediately perceive yourſelf more alert. At firſt it operates by Stool, and eſpecially Urine. It is of ſovereign Efficacy to ſtrengthen the Bowels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their loſt Tone, and renew the vital Heat. But I have already mention'd its excellent Qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King's Bath</hi> is an oblong Square, the Walls full of Niches, perhaps the <hi>Romans</hi> Work. There are Twelve on the North Side; Eight on the Eaſt and Weſt; about Four larger Arches on the South. At every Corner are the Steps to deſcend into it, and a Parapet or Baluſtrade with a Walk round it.</p>
            <p>The Springs were doubtleſs ſeparated from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Springs by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and fenced in with a durable Wall. There goes a probable Tradition of ſubterranean Canals of their making, to carry off the other Waters, leſt they ſhould mix with theſe, and deſtroy the Heat.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that at the cleanſing of the Springs, when they ſet down a new Pump, they conſtantly find great Quantities of Hazel-nuts, as in many other Places among ſubterraneous Timber. Theſe, Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> doubts not, are the Remainder of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Deluge, which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Hiſtorian tell us was in Autumn, Providence by that means ſecuring the Revival of the Vegetable World.</p>
            <p>In the Bath People ſtand up to the Chin, Men and Women, and ſtew, moſtly in the way of Gallantry.</p>
            <p>Many are the Diſeaſes which here find a Remedy, when judiciouſly applied, as I obſerv'd above. The Confleunce hither is greater in Summer, than in Winter, tho' the latter, of the two, ſeems the more preferable Seaſon for medicinal Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0141100402:263"/>Behind the Southern Wall of <hi>the King's Bath,</hi> is a leſs Square, named <hi>the Queen's Bath,</hi> with a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of Four Pillars in the midſt. This is of more temperate Warmth, as borrowing its Water from the other. There are likewiſe Pumps and Pumping-rooms, for pouring hot Streams on any Part of the Body; which in many Caſes is very ſalutary.</p>
            <p>In the South-weſt Part of the Town are two other Baths, not to be diſregarded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Hot-bath</hi> is not much inferior in Heat to <hi>the King's Bath</hi>; it is a ſmall Parallelogram, with a Stone Tabernacle of Four Pillars in the midſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Croſs-bath</hi> near it is triangular, and had a Croſs in the middle. Hard by is an Hoſpital built and endow'd by a Prelate of this See. The Water in theſe two Places riſes near the Level of the Streets.</p>
            <p>On the South Side of the Cathedral are ſome Parts of the Abbey left, and the Gate-houſe belonging to it.</p>
            <p>Within theſe few Years, by a Contribution, a cold Bath for the Benefit of the Infirm was made at a Spring beyond the Bridge.</p>
            <p>Two <hi>Roman</hi> Inſcriptions have been ſet in the Eaſtern Wall of the Cathedral, fronting the Walks; which, beſides the Injuries of the Weather, are expoſed to the miſchievous Sport of Boys, who throw Stones at them.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Baths are very indifferently kept, as their Uſe ſo much increaſes. But a fine Deſign is now on foot to make convenient Slips, with Dreſſing-rooms, and Apartments for Pumping on People, without going into the Bath, and for inlarging the Pump-room ſo as to hold four or five Pumps.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Decency is obſerved here by both Sexes; and while Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi> lives, it muſt be always ſo. There is a very good Conveniency of Chairs, of which there are great Plenty, and very genteel ones,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0141100402:264"/>
to go to any Part within the Walls, and even to the adjoining Buildings without, for 6<hi>d.</hi> provided the Diſtance does not exceed 500 Yards; but if it does, the Fare is 1<hi>s.</hi> and for this the Chairmen are obliged to go a Mile. In ſhort, it is a delightful Place enough, when you are in it, but a dreadful one to come at, down high Hills, in ſome Places like Precipices: but Health or Pleaſure obliges People to diſpenſe with this Difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bath</hi> being invironed with Hills, there are few pleaſant Walks out of the Town, or even Rides, without clambering much to <hi>Landſdown-hill,</hi> or that called <hi>Clarton-down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is for this Reaſon, that very few People care to keep Coaches here. And the Hill up to <hi>Lanſdown,</hi> particularly, is ſo ſteep, that the late Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was extremely frighted in going up: her Coachman ſtopping to give the Horſes Breath, and the Coach wanting a Dragſtaff, it ran back in ſpite of all the Coachman's Skill; the Horſes not being brought to ſtrain the Harneſs again, or pull together for a good while, and the Coach putting the Guards behind in great Confuſion: at laſt ſome of the Servants, ſetting their Heads and Shoulders to the Wheels, ſtopt them by mere Force.</p>
            <p>The General Hoſpital now near finiſhed in this City, for the Reception of the ſick Poor all over the Kingdom, is a very noble Deſign. The firſt Stone of it was laid the 6th of <hi>July</hi> 1738. It is built where the old Play-houſe ſtood, and is a noble Pile of Building, 100 Feet in Front, and 90 Feet deep. It is capable of receiving 150 poor Cripples. Its chief Benefactor is Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> of whom we ſhall ſay more anon, who gave all the Wall-ſtone, Free-ſtone ready wrought, Paving-ſtone, and Lime uſed in it. The Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Wales</hi> have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been great Promoters of the Work.</p>

               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0141100402:271"/>A very great Deſign is now alſo begun in this City, of which the following is a brief Account.</p>
            <p>On the 10th of <hi>March</hi> 1739-40, the firſt Stone of a new Square was laid, in the Gardens adjoining to the publick Walks. The principal Side of this Square is to have the Appearance of one Houſe, 520 Feet in Front, and 260 Feet in Depth, but is to be divided into 40 Houſes: each Front is to have 63 Windows, and each End 31. Two of the other Sides are to ſerve as Wings to the principal Side: each Wing is to contain 24 Houſes upon a perfect Square of 210 Feet, and the Front of theſe Wings are every one to have 25 Windows; ſo that when the whole Building is viewed in Front, it will ſhew 113 Windows, extend 1040 Feet, and from the diſtant Hills look like one grand Palace. The three Piles of Building will be adorned with above 300 Columns and Pilaſters in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order:—Upon the Corner of every Pile there will be a Tower, and in every Front will be a Centre-houſe and a Pediment.</p>
            <p>A noble Houſe for publick Aſſemblies is to be erected by Subſcription in this Square; the Ball<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room will be like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hall, and contain in Length 90 Feet, and Breadth 52 Feet. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly-room will be 90 Feet long. There will be a Garden for the Ladies to walk in; a Bowling-green for the Gentlemen; a grand Parade of 200 Yards long, a Terrace 500 Yards in Circumference, a Portico of the ſame Dimenſions, with divers other Walks in common for all People, and ſo diſpoſed, that Gentlemen and Ladies may walk at any Seaſon of the Year, at any Hour of the Day, and in any Weather. So that by theſe great Improvements <hi>Bath</hi> will be rendered one of the moſt agreeable Places in the World; for, facing this Square, a Bridge with an Arch of 102 Feet opening will be built over the River, by which People of Diſtinction may go to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0141100402:272"/>
the <hi>Downs,</hi> as into their own Gardens, for the Air and Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Avon</hi> runs by the Back of the Town; and on the Banks of it, Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> who is the Genius of the Place, and whoſe Works and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions there, next to the Waters, are better worth the Attention of the Curious, than any thing in <hi>Bath,</hi> has a fine Wharf, and other convenient Places, to ſhape, to work, to imbark the Stones of many Tons Weight, which he digs from the Quarry, on the adjacent Hill. This he does by an admirable Machine, which runs down the Hill by Grooves placed in the Ground, without Horſes or any other Help, than one Man to guide it, who alſo by a particular Spring can ſtop it in the ſteepeſt Part of the Hill, and in the ſwifteſt Part of its Motion. Theſe Stones he can carry by the <hi>Avon</hi> to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> whence they may be tranſported to any other Part of <hi>England</hi>; and the new Works of <hi>St. Bartholomew's</hi> Hoſpital, <hi>London,</hi> are built with them. He is build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf a very magnificent Houſe of this Stone, with a fine Chapel, and noble Stables and Offices; and has delightful Gardens laid out with a Profuſion of Fancy, yet with great Oeconomy, as to the Expence: for, in ſhort, Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Situation of his Houſe and Gardens, (and indeed well he may, for it is a very fine one) and, inſtead of forcing Nature by a great Expence to bend to Art, he purſues only what the natural Scite points out to him, and, by ſo doing, will make it one of the cheapeſt, and at the ſame time one of the moſt beautiful Seats in <hi>England.</hi> He levels no Hills, but enjoys the Beauty of the Proſpects they afford; he cuts down no Woods, but ſtrikes thro' them fine Walks, and next-to-natural Mazes; and has, by that means, a delightful Grove always filled with Birds, which afford the rural Ear a Muſick tranſcending all others. Nor does he want for fine Conveniencies
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0141100402:273"/>
of Water; and as he is a Gentleman who is not enter'd into the preſent faſhionable Schemes of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing Religion and Scripture, he has a Figure of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtriking the Rock, and the Water guſhing out of it, which forms a ſort of natural Caſcade, whence his Baſon is ſupplied; and is a pretty Alluſion to his producing all his Works from the Stone Quarry in his Neighbourhood. This is the ſame Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> who firſt invented the Croſs-Poſt, ſo uſeful for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Letters to Places, which before were, in that Particular, at the greateſt Uncertainty. The Taſte of this Gentleman in his Gardening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſo aptly deſcribed by Mrs. <hi>Chandler</hi> of the Place, in an ingenious Poem, called, <hi>The Deſcription of</hi> BATH, that the following Quotation from it, muſt be acceptable.

            </p>
            <p>When one is upon <hi>Kingſdown,</hi> and has paſs'd all the Steeps and Difficulties of the Aſcent, there is a plain and pleaſant Country for many Miles into <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and two very noble Houſes, the one built by Mr. <hi>Blathwait,</hi> late Secretary at War; and the other is call'd <hi>Badmington,</hi> a Manſion of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor muſt we forget to mention the handſome Monument erected by Order of the late Lord <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,</hi> to the Honour of Sir <hi>Bevil Granville,</hi> his Lordſhip's Anceſtor, with an Inſcription recording the Action in which he fell. It is built on the Brow of <hi>Lanſdown-Hill,</hi> on the very Spot, as near as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, where that brave Gentleman was kill'd, in the Action between him and Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> in the late Civil Wars; of which Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> and others give Account.</p>
            <p>I ought not to omit, that in the Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament 1738-9, an Act paſſed for inlarging the Terms and Powers granted by Two former Acts of Parliament, for Repairing and Inlarging the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways between the Top of <hi>Kingſdown-Hill</hi> and the City of <hi>Bath</hi>; and for Amending ſeveral other Roads leading from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and other Places, to <hi>Bath</hi>; and for <hi>cleanſing, paving,</hi> and <hi>enlightening</hi> the STREETS, and regulating the CHAIRMEN there; and for keeping a regular Nightly WATCH, within the ſaid City and Liberties: All which, when ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected according to the Intention of the Act, will be a great Conveniency to <hi>Bath,</hi> and to Perſons reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it.</p>
            <p>I will juſt mention alſo, that at <hi>Chipping-Norton-Lane,</hi> near <hi>Bath,</hi> was a Fight between the Forces
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0141100402:275"/>
of King <hi>James</hi> II. and thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in which the latter had the Advantage, and, if they had purſu'd it, would have gain'd a complete Victory. An old Elm-Tree, ſtanding near <hi>Stanton-Drew,</hi> in a Road leading three Ways, afforded a ſad Teſtimony of the Event of the Duke's Enterprize; for it was all overſpread with the Heads and Limbs of the unfortunate Perſons engag'd in his Cauſe, who ſuffer'd by the Sentence of the mercileſs <hi>Jefferies.</hi>

            <p>About <hi>Twyfordton,</hi> not far from <hi>Bath,</hi> is a fallow Field, call'd <hi>Marſbury-Field,</hi> with but little Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Earth upon the Rock. This was very full of foſſile Shells, which had preſerv'd their natural Colour of Blue and White as perfectly as at firſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Chu</hi> Pariſh is <hi>Bowditch,</hi> ſo call'd from its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Form; it was a large Camp on a Hill trebly fortified, whence you may behold the Iſles of <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi> and <hi>Steepholm</hi> in the Sea. Here is a petrifying Spring. This Country abounds with Coal-pits. The Slates which lie upon it, and have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their due Quantity of Sulphur, ſo as to make perfect Coal, are moſt curiouſly mark'd with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Plants, particularly thoſe of Fern. This is indeed a Rock, full of Springs, a very bad Road for Travelling, conſiſting of ſhort and ſteep Valleys, narrow Lanes, intricate, dark, and hard. The Ground is very rich, and bears much Wood. The Neatneſs of the Houſes even of the poorer Sort of People is remarkable, being generally whited over, and imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd with little Gardens. We come in Ten Miles from <hi>Bath</hi> to the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the greateſt, the richeſt, and the beſt Port of Trade in <hi>Great-Britain, London</hi> only excepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſtol</hi> has been formerly a Place of Strength, and had a Caſtle, in which King <hi>Stephen</hi> was kept Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſome time by <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in the Civil Wars, and made a good Defence. The Caſtle ſtood till the Time of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0141100402:276"/>
who demoliſh'd it. It is a County-Town, and one of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.'s new Biſhopricks.</p>
            <p>The Merchants of this City have not only the greateſt Trade, but they trade with a more intire In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency upon <hi>London,</hi> than any other Town in <hi>Britain.</hi> And 'tis evident in this Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatſoever Exportations they make to any Part of the World, they are able to bring the full Returns back to their own Port, and can diſpoſe of them there; which is not the Caſe in any other Port in <hi>England</hi>; where they are often oblig'd either to ſhip part of the Effects in the Ports abroad, on the Ships bound to <hi>London</hi>; or to conſign their own Veſſels to <hi>London,</hi> in order both to get Freight, and diſpoſe of their own Cargoes.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Merchants, as they have a very great Trade abroad, ſo they have always Buyers at home for their Returns, and that ſuch Buyers, that no Cargo is too big for them. To this Purpoſe, the Shopkeepers in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who in general are Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale-men, have ſo great an Inland Trade among all the Weſtern Counties, that they maintain Carriers, juſt as the <hi>London</hi> Tradeſmen do, to all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Countries and Towns from <hi>Southampton</hi> in the South, even to the Banks of the <hi>Trent,</hi> North; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have no navigable River that Way.</p>
            <p>Add to this, That, as well by Sea, as by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of two great Rivers, the <hi>Wye,</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> they have the whole Trade of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> as it were, to themſelves, and the greateſt Part of that of <hi>North-Wales</hi>; and as to their Trade to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is prodigiouſly increas'd ſince the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithſtanding the great Trade which of late the Merchants of <hi>Liverpool</hi> alſo drive with that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Inconveniencies of <hi>Briſtol</hi> are its Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, its narrow Streets, and the Narrowneſs of its River; and we might mention alſo another

               <hi>Narrow</hi>; that is, the <hi>Minds</hi> of the Generality of its People; for, let me tell you, the Merchants of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> tho' very rich, are not like the Merchants of <hi>London:</hi> the latter may be ſaid (as of old of the Merchants of <hi>Tyre</hi>) to vie with the Princes of the Earth; whereas the former, being rais'd by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Prizes taken in the Wars, from Maſters of Ships, and blunt Tars, have imbib'd the Manners of theſe rough Gentlemen ſo ſtrongly, that they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to their Deſcendants, only with a little more of the Sordid, than is generally to be found among the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sailors; and I would adviſe the rich ones among them, if they would be a little more polite and generous, than they uſually are, to <hi>travel,</hi> but not out of <hi>England</hi> neither; I mean only to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (that is, from the ſecond great Trading Town to the firſt); and they will ſee Examples worth their Imitation, as well for princely Spirit, as upright and generous Dealings.</p>
            <p>The Corporation being very tenacious in not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Perſons to trade in their Liberty, who are not Freemen, there are not ſo many new Buildings, and Improvements of Streets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as would otherwiſe be. As for the City itſelf, there is hardly Room to ſet another Houſe in it. The great Square, called <hi>Queen</hi>'s, formerly the <hi>Mead,</hi> where the Ground was ſubject to the Hazard of Inundations, is now ſo rais'd, that it is free from that Inconvenience: It is very handſomely built and inhabited, and a fine Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian Statue of King <hi>William</hi> III. erected in the middle of it, done by the famous <hi>Ryſbrack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Quay along the River is very noble, and well filled with all Sorts of Merchandize, and a handſome Row of Houſes fronts it. And I was inform'd, when I was there laſt, that in order to make the Back of this City more commodious than ever, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration have purchaſed ſeveral Houſes adjoining to the Back-Gate, in order to pull them down, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0141100402:280"/>
make all fluſh from the Conduit on the Back, clear round to the Quay; which when finiſh'd, will be one of the completeſt Harbours in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Quay is reckoned the longeſt in <hi>England.</hi> It has a Crane on it, the Workmanſhip of the late ingenious Mr. <hi>Padmore,</hi> which is not to be equalled in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Merchants are greatly benefited by it, in the extraordinary Diſpatch it gives to the diſcharging of their Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>College-Green</hi> is deemed the healthieſt Situation in the City.</p>
            <p>There is erected within theſe few Years an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Room, for Entertainment and Amuſement of the Gay, as at other conſiderable Places; for Luxury muſt always follow Riches. It is a very handſome Building, and ſtands in the Way from the City to the <hi>Hot-well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old Theatre at <hi>Stokes-Croft</hi> is alſo alter'd into a commodious Room for an Aſſembly, which is held every <hi>Tueſday</hi> during the Winter.</p>
            <p>There were, when I was there, no leſs than fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Glaſs-Houſes in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which is more than are in the City of <hi>London:</hi> they uſe indeed, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a very great Number of Glaſs Bottles, which they ſend fill'd with Beer, Cyder, and Wine, to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> much more than goes from <hi>London</hi>; alſo vaſt Numbers of Bottles are now uſed for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Rock, not only all over <hi>England,</hi> but, we may ſay, all over the World.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hot-well,</hi> or Water of St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Rock, is without the City, at the Confluence of the two little Rivers, and on the North-ſide of the Stream. Not many Years ſince, this Spring lay open at the Foot of the Rock, and was covered by the ſalt Water at every Tide; and yet it preſerved both its Warmth and Virtue intire.</p>
            <p>The Rock, tho' hard to Admiration, has ſince that been work'd down, partly by Labour, and partly
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0141100402:281"/>
blown in Pieces by Gunpowder; and an handſome large Houſe is built upon it, where they have good Apartments for entertaining diſtemper'd Perſons. The Well is ſecur'd, and a good Pump is fix'd in it, ſo that they have the Water pure and unmix'd from the Spring itſelf, and they export vaſt Quantities; for this Water keeps its Virtue better than that of <hi>Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following curious Account of the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I am indebted for to the ſame eminent Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who favoured me with the learned Account of the Nature, and Efficacy of the <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Waters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters, he ſays, ſeem only a natural Lime-water, or pure Element impregnated with a natural unburnt Limeſtone. All the Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains round that Water are nothing but a Quarry of natural unburnt Limeſtone, which is daily dug up there for Building, and manifeſts itſelf to the Senſes. This makes theſe <hi>Briſtol</hi> Waters, one of the pureſt, beſt, and moſt ſalutary, mere aqueous Elements on the Globe, to cool all over-heated Bowels, and to leſſen all preternatural Diſcharges. But the ſmall <hi>Milk-warmth</hi> in them, when immediately pump'd up, upon the Well's being drain'd of the Influx of the Tide, ſhews there is ſome other Principle in them beſides natural Limeſtone: and that in Nature can be no other than ſome weak Impregnation of Sulphur with Nitre or Sea Salt, or perhaps a ſlight Touch of Iron. The Stones are ſome reddiſh, ſome blackiſh, that are digg'd out of the Mountains circumjacent, but all of them natural Limeſtone. Theſe reddiſh and blackiſh Colours in the Stones neceſſarily imply Sulphur and Iron; and theſe Three Principles, by chymical Proceſſes and Mixtures, are diſcovered in ſome ſmall Proportion in the Waters. They are excellent in all ſcorbutick and nervous Atrophies, in Hecticks, weak Lungs, all Inflammations in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0141100402:282"/>
Part, all preternatural Evacuations; in ſhort, in all acrid Juices and viſcid Blood, being a natural Simple <hi>Alcali</hi>; and in the firſt Stages of a <hi>Phthiſis Pulmonum</hi>; and if early had recourſe to, and long continued under a low, cooling, nutritive Regimen, they would probably ſtop the Growth and Cauſes of moſt chronical Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>There are 17 Pariſhes in the City, but 19 Churches, including the Cathedral and the Church of <hi>St. Mark.</hi> There are beſides thoſe Churches, ſeveral Meeting-houſes, for the different Sectaries, <hi>viz.</hi> Independents, Quakers, and Baptiſts.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is far from extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Several of the Churches are very neat, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully decorated, and worthy a Traveller's Attention. That of <hi>St. Mary Radcliffe,</hi> or <hi>Redcliff,</hi> is a noble and ſtately Edifice. It is very large and ſpacious, and has a fine Steeple or Tower.</p>
            <p>In it is a very antient Monument for Mr. <hi>William Cannings,</hi> Burgeſs and Merchant of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church, and a great Benefactor otherwiſe to the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On one Part of the Monument is a <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, full of Abbreviations; and, on the other Side, in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> an Inſcription to his Praiſe, which I have not room to inſert.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo an Inſcription on the Monument of Sir <hi>William Penn,</hi> Knt. Vice-Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the great <hi>William Penn,</hi> one of the Heads of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who was a Native of the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great Face of Seriouſneſs and Religion appears at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Magiſtrates are laudably ſtrict in exacting the Obſervation of the Sabbath, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general Diſſoluteneſs that has broken in almoſt every-where elſe.</p>
            <p>One thing they deſerve high Commendation for; and that is the Neatneſs obſerv'd in keeping their Churches, and the Care they take in preſerving the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0141100402:283"/>
Monuments and Inſcriptions of thoſe bury'd in 'em. A Practice ſcandalouſly neglected almoſt every-where elſe in <hi>England,</hi> and even at Places we might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where Money (another ſcandalous Practice) is exacted for ſeeing them. This Care of the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Dead brings many Viſitors to their Churches of travelling Strangers, who are always pleas'd with it, and make Compariſons in its Favour, tho' very little to the Credit of ſome others, who are more negligent. 'Tis indeed ſtrange, That the Heirs and Families of the Deceaſed ſhould not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more concern'd, than they generally are, to keep up the Monuments of their Anceſtors. With great Piety, and at a great Expence, the next Heir, or the moſt oblig'd, rears a Monument to the Deceas'd, and it is dedicated, too, profeſſedly, to Poſterity. In a very little while, the Monument is cover'd with Duſt and Cobwebs, and the Inſcription often effaced. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Decency does not ſucceed to this Piety, and it becomes a Monument of the Ingratitude or Neglect of the Survivors, rather than an Honour to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd.</p>
            <p>Methinks Vanity alone, the common Inducement to theſe Erections, ſhould inſpire another Manner of Acting. I cannot account for it any other way, but that from the Prince to the Peaſant, as a Family generally lies together in one Vault or Tomb, very few are willing to ſee or think of their Coffins; and hence it is, That ſome Men often look upon their very Heirs as <hi>Memento Mori's.</hi> Unhappy Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, equally to be lamented and deſpis'd!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſtol</hi> is ſuppoſed to have an hundred thouſand Inhabitants in the City, and within three Miles of its Circumference; and they ſay, above Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sail of Ships belong to that Port.</p>
            <p>'Tis very remarkable, That this City is ſo well ſupply'd with Coals, that tho' they are all brought by Land Carriage, yet they are generally laid down
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0141100402:284"/>
at the Doors of the Inhabitants, at ſeven, eight, or nine Shillings <hi>per</hi> Chaldron.</p>
            <p>The Situation of the City is low, but on the Side of a riſing Hill. The Ground Plat of it is ſaid very much to reſemble that of old <hi>Rome,</hi> being circular, with a ſomething greater Diameter one way than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but enough to make it oval; and the River cutting off one ſmall Part, as it were, a Sixth, or leſs, from the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Bridge over the <hi>Avon</hi> is exceeding ſtrong, the Arches very high, becauſe of the Depth of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Buildings ſo cloſe upon it, that in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Bridge, you ſee nothing but an intire full-built Street. The Tide of Flood riſes here near ſix Fathom, and runs very ſtrong.</p>
            <p>They draw all their heavy Goods here on <hi>Sleds,</hi> or <hi>Sledges,</hi> which they call <hi>Gee-hoes,</hi> without Wheels. This kills a Multitude of Horſes; and the Pavement is worn ſo ſmooth by them, that in wet Weather the Streets are very ſlippery, and in froſty Weather 'tis dangerous walking.</p>
            <p>The noble Charities of Mr. <hi>Edward Colſton,</hi> a worthy Merchant of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and his Foundations, are an Honour to the Place, and to the Memory of that excellent Man: and I am ſorry, that my narrow Limits will not permit me to give a particular Account of them.</p>
            <p>But I ought not to omit, that one of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities only, coſt him 25000<hi>l.</hi> and that is the noble Hoſpital or Alms-houſe erected by him, in the Year 1691, upon his own Ground, on <hi>St. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael's-Hill.</hi> The Front and two Sides are fac'd with Freeſtone: it contains a Chapel neatly adorn'd, 24 Apartments, and other Conveniencies, for 12 Men, and 12 Women. The elder Brother receives 6<hi>s.</hi> and each of the others 3<hi>s.</hi> weekly, beſides an Allowance for Coal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To a Clergyman is paid the Sum of 10<hi>l.</hi> yearly, for reading the <hi>Common</hi>

               <hi>Prayer</hi> twice every Day, except when Prayers are read in <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s Church, at which every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Alms-houſe is to attend.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1696, he alſo purchas'd a Piece of Ground in <hi>Temple-ſtreet,</hi> and built at his own Charge a School and Dwelling-houſe, for a Maſter to inſtruct 40 Boys, in Writing, Arithmetick, and the Church Catechiſm. The Boys are likewiſe to be cloathed.</p>
            <p>And his other Charities and Benefactions were without Number.</p>
            <p>On <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Day, <hi>June</hi> 29. 1738, was open'd at the Mint, an Infirmary for this City, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the ſick, lame, and diſtreſſed Poor, after the Example of thoſe in <hi>London, Wincheſter,</hi> &amp;c. It is denominated <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Hoſpital, and very liberal Contributions have been made to it; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, we are told, that <hi>John Elbridge,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Comptroller of the Cuſtoms in this City, who dy'd <hi>February</hi> 1738-9, beſides many other charitable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, bequeathed 5000<hi>l.</hi> to this Infirmary, beſides endowing a Charity School on <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s Hill, which he built ſeveral Years before his Death, for edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and cloathing a certain Number of poor Girls.</p>
            <p>Large Pieces of Ground are clear'd for building a Market, and a magnificent Exchange; the former in <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> and the latter in <hi>Corn-ſtreet.</hi> The old Buildings which have been deſtroy'd for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, have coſt the Chamber of this City upwards of Twenty thouſand Pounds. And on the 10th of <hi>March</hi> 1740-1, the firſt Stone of the Exchange was laid by the Mayor, with great Ceremony, with ſeveral Pieces of Gold and Silver Coin under it, and this Inſcription, on the Stone:
<q>

               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0141100402:286"/>That is,
<q>
                  <hi>In the Reign of</hi> GEORGE II. <hi>Pious, Proſperous, Auguſt, Vindicator, at Home and Abroad, of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Trade,</hi> HENRY COMBE, <hi>Mayor, placed the Firſt Stone of this Structure erected by the Votes of the Citizens, and at the publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> A. D. 1740.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Edifice when finiſh'd, will be one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleteſt of its Kind in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old Library in <hi>King-ſtreet</hi> is rebuilding in a very handſome Manner, as is alſo <hi>Merchant-Taylors-Hall</hi> in <hi>Broad-ſtreet,</hi> a Freeſtone Building near 70 Feet long, and Breadth proportionable.</p>
            <p>From this City I had Thoughts of coaſting the Marſhes or Border of <hi>Wales,</hi> eſpecially <hi>South-Wales,</hi> by tracing the Rivers <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Lug,</hi> in <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Herefordſhire:</hi> but chang'd my Mind on Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Danger of the Ferries over the <hi>Severn.</hi> In the mean time, I reſolv'd to follow the Courſe of this famous River, by which I ſhould neceſſarily ſee the richeſt, moſt fertile, and moſt agreeable Part of <hi>England</hi>; the Banks of the <hi>Thames</hi> only excepted.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Briſtol,</hi> Weſt, you enter the County of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and keeping the <hi>Avon</hi> in View, you ſee <hi>King-Road,</hi> where the Ships generally take their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, as ours at <hi>London</hi> do from <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and <hi>Hung-Road</hi>; and where they notify their Arrival, as ours for <hi>London</hi> do in the <hi>Downs.</hi> The one lies within the <hi>Avon,</hi> the other in the <hi>Severn Sea.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed great Part of <hi>Briſtol</hi> is in the Bounds of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> though it be a County of itſelf. From hence going away a little North-weſt, we come to the <hi>Pill,</hi> a convenient Road for Shipping, and where therefore they generally run back for <hi>Ireland,</hi> or for <hi>Wales.</hi> There is alſo, a little farther, an ugly, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and very inconvenient Ferry over the <hi>Severn,</hi> to the Mouth of <hi>Wye</hi>; namely, at <hi>Auſt</hi>; which I ſhall mention again preſently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0141100402:287"/>As we turn <hi>North</hi> towards <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> we loſe the Sight of the <hi>Avon,</hi> and, in about two Miles, exchange it for an open View of the <hi>Severn Sea,</hi> which you ſee on the Weſt Side, and which ſeems as broad as the Ocean there; except that you ſee two ſmall Iſlands in it, and that looking N. W. you diſcern plainly the Coaſt of <hi>South-Wales</hi>; and particularly, a little nearer hand, the Shore of <hi>Monmouthſhire.</hi> Then, as you go on, the Shores begin to draw towards one another, and the Coaſts to lie parallel; ſo that the <hi>Severn</hi> appears to be a plain River, or an <hi>Aeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arium,</hi> ſomewhat like the <hi>Humber,</hi> or as the <hi>Thames</hi> is at the <hi>Nore,</hi> being 4 to 5 and 6 Miles over; and is indeed a moſt raging and furious kind of Sea. This is occaſion'd by thoſe violent Tides call'd the <hi>Bore,</hi> which flow here ſometimes 6 or 7 Feet at once, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forward like a mighty Wave: ſo that the Stern of a Veſſel ſhall on a ſudden be lifted up 6 or 7 Feet upon the Water, when the Head of it is faſt a-ground.</p>
            <p>After Coaſting the Shore about 4 Miles farther, the Road being by the low Salt Marſhes kept at a Diſtance from the River; we came to <hi>Auſt</hi> Ferry, from a little dirty Village call'd <hi>Auſt</hi>; near which you come to take Boat.</p>
            <p>This Ferry lands you at <hi>Beachly</hi> in <hi>Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> ſo that on the Outſide it is call'd <hi>Auſt Paſſage,</hi> and on the other Side <hi>Beachly Paſſage.</hi> From whence you go by Land two little Miles to <hi>Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow,</hi> a large Port Town on the River <hi>Wye.</hi> But of that Part I ſhall ſay more in its Place.</p>
            <p>Here is a good neat Chapel, with an high Tower at the Weſt-end, adorned with Pinacles.</p>
            <p>This Place is memorable from a Circumſtance in the Reign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> I. who being here, invited <hi>Lewellin</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who was on the other Side, to come over and confer with him, and ſettle ſome Matters in Diſpute between them; but the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0141100402:288"/>
Prince refuſed, and the King thereupon croſs'd over to him, who, in a Rapture of Generoſity, leap'd into the Water, to receive the King in his Boat, telling him, His Humility had conquer'd his Pride, and his Wiſdom triumphed over his Folly.</p>
            <p>When we came to <hi>Auſt,</hi> the hither Side of the <hi>Paſſage,</hi> the Sea was ſo broad, the Fame of the <hi>Bore</hi> of the Tide ſo formidable, the Wind alſo made the Water ſo rough, and, which was worſe, the Boats to carry over both Man and Horſe appear'd ſo very mean, that, in ſhort, none of us car'd to venture: ſo we came back, and reſolv'd to keep on the Road to <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thornbury</hi> is a Market Town, and hath a Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Mayor and 12 Aldermen, and was given in the Conqueror's Time to the famous <hi>Fitz-Hammon.</hi> Here are the Foundations of a large Caſtle, deſign'd but never finiſh'd, by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.'s Time. Here is a ſpacious Church built Cathedral-wiſe, it has fine wide Ayles, and 3 Chancels, with a high and beautiful Tower. Here is a Free-School and 4 ſmall Alms-houſes.</p>
            <p>On the right lies <hi>Wotton,</hi> a pretty Market-town, governed by a Mayor elected annually at the Court-Leet. 'Tis famous for its Cloathing Trade. The Church, which is a Vicarage, is large, and hath Two wide Ayles, and an high handſome Tower, adorned with Battlements and Pinacles. There are in it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Tombs, Monuments, and Inſcriptions, chiefly for the Family of <hi>Berkley.</hi> Here is a Free-ſchool and ſome Charity-houſes.</p>
            <p>Directly North of this Town lies <hi>Durſley,</hi> a good Cloathing and Market Town, governed by a Bailiff and 4 Conſtables, and has been formerly noted for ſharp, over-reaching People, from whence aroſe a Proverbial Saying of a ſharp Man, <hi>He is a Man of</hi> Durſley. The Church is good, hath 2 Ayles, and an handſome Spire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0141100402:289"/>Turning North-weſt, we came to <hi>Berkley,</hi> a noted Town, ſo called from <hi>Berk,</hi> a Beech, and <hi>Leas,</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is the largeſt Pariſh in the County, and conſiſts of rich Meadow-grounds, and above 30 Pariſhes depend on this Manor, for which a Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farm Rent was paid, in King <hi>Henry</hi> II.'s Time, of 500<hi>l.</hi> 17<hi>s.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> which ſhews the vaſt Extent and Value of this Eſtate. It belongs to the preſent Earl of <hi>Berkley,</hi> who is alſo Baron of <hi>Durſley.</hi> Adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Town is the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Berkley,</hi> a magnificent, tho' antique Building, and the antient Seat of this noble Family, from whence it derives its Name as well as Title, ever ſince the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. who gave it to <hi>Robert Fitzharding,</hi> who aſſumed the Name of <hi>Berkley,</hi> and from whom the preſent Earl is lineally deſcended. King <hi>Edw.</hi> II. of <hi>England,</hi> as all our learned Writers agree, was murder'd in this Caſtle; as King <hi>Richard</hi> II. was in that of <hi>Pontefract,</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>; but I refer to our Hiſtories for theſe horrid Facts. They ſhew the Apartments, where they ſay that King was kept a Priſoner: but they do not admit that he was kill'd there. The Place is rather antient, than pleaſant or healthful, lying low, and near the Water. Here is a large ſpacious Church, with an Ayle on each Side, and a Chapel adjoining, which is the Burial-place of the Family, a neat Veſtry, and a ſtrong high Tower.</p>
            <p>On the Right of the Road is <hi>Stanley,</hi> a little Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town, where was formerly a Priory, the Ruins whereof appear ſtill. The Church is built in the Form of a Croſs, with a Tower in the middle.</p>
            <p>A great Improvement has been lately made in theſe Parts; for the Earl of <hi>Berkley</hi> has juſt finiſhed (1740) a great Bulwark at <hi>Frampton</hi> upon <hi>Severn,</hi> near this Place, called <hi>Hock-Crib,</hi> the Deſign of which is to inforce the River <hi>Severn,</hi> by <hi>Art's-Point,</hi> into its former Chanel. It is ſaid his Lordſhip intends to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0141100402:290"/>
build another, four Miles below the former, by which he will undoubtedly gain a large Tract of Land, contiguous to what is call'd the <hi>New Grounds,</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none in <hi>England</hi> for the Richneſs of its Soil.</p>
            <p>From hence we ſaw, acroſs the River, the antient Foreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> which once contained 30000 Acres of Land, being Twenty Miles long, and ſo full of Wood, that it was very dangerous to travel through it. Its Oak was famous for Shipping, the Glory of our own, and ſo much the Envy of other Nations, that the famous <hi>Spaniſh Armada</hi> had it in ſpecial Charge to burn it. The great Number of Iron Forges near it has greatly leſſened, tho' not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the Wood, which is ſtill preſerved with great Care. It is ſubject to Foreſt-Laws, and the Iron-Miners have here a Court alſo.</p>
            <p>From hence to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> we ſee nothing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but a moſt fertile, rich Country, and a fine River, but narrower, as you go Northward, till, a little before we come to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> it ceaſes to be navigable by Ships of Burden, but continues to be ſo, by large Barges, above an hundred Miles farther, not reckoning the Turnings and Windings of the River: beſides that it receives ſeveral large and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers into it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glouceſter</hi> (call'd by the <hi>Britons, Caer-glow,</hi> i. e. <hi>Fine City,</hi> and in Imitation of it <hi>Glevum</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>) abounds much with Croſſes and Statues of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and has an handſome Proſpect of Steeples, ſome without a Church; for in the late Civil Wars, when it held out vigorouſly againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and was then very ſtrong, it ſuffer'd much; for its Eleven Churches were then reduced to Five, and all its Walls and Works were demoliſhed. The City is ſtill tolerably built; and here is a large Stone Bridge over the <hi>Severn,</hi> the firſt next the Sea. Here are ſeveral Market-houſes ſupported with Pillars, one a very old one of Stone, in <hi>Gothick</hi> Architecture,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0141100402:291"/>
antient and uncommon, now turn'd into a Ciſtern for Water.</p>
            <p>The old Proverb, <hi>As ſure as God's at</hi> Glouceſter, certainly alluded to the vaſt Number of Churches and religious Foundations here; for you can ſcarce walk paſt 10 Doors, but ſomewhat of that ſort occurs.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is an old venerable Pile. The Weſtern Part is old and mean; but from the Tower, which is very handſome, you have a moſt glorious Proſpect Eaſtward, thro' the Choir finely vaulted at top; and the Ladies Chapel to the Eaſt Window, which is very magnificent. On the North-ſide lies that unfortunate King <hi>Edw.</hi> II. in an Alabaſter Tomb, and, out of the Abundance of pious Offerings to his Remains, the Religious built this Choir; and the Votaries to his Shrine, for ſome time after his Death, could hardly find Room in the Town. So changeable are the Tempers of Men! and ſo little a Space is requir'd to diſpoſe the Minds of the fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Many, to <hi>Hoſannah</hi> or <hi>Crucify!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before the High Altar in the Middle of the Church, lies the equally unfortunate Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> eldeſt Son of the Conqueror, after a miſerable Life for many Years before his Death. But his Monument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and his Bones are at Reſt; which is more than can be ſaid of the Monument of his younger Brother, King <hi>Henry</hi> I. who, as the ſecond Brother <hi>William Rufus</hi> had done, robbed him of his Right, and no Traces of his Monument are left at <hi>Reading-Abbey,</hi> where he was bury'd with his Queen. He lies in a wooden Tomb, with his Coat of Arms painted, and upon it his Effigies in <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oak, croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd like a <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Knight. The famous <hi>Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,</hi> who ſubdued <hi>Ireland,</hi> lies buried in the Chapter-houſe.</p>
            <p>The Cloyſters in this Cathedral are exquiſitely beautiful, in the Style of the Chapel of <hi>King's-College, Cambridge.</hi> There are large Remains in the City
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0141100402:292"/>
of Abbeys of Black and White Friers. A Mile or two diſtant is <hi>Robin Hood</hi>'s Hill, as it is called, which affords now a pleaſant Walk for the Citizens, and from which they are attempting to ſupply the City with Water, which it much wants. By this City, the <hi>Rickning</hi> Way runs from the <hi>Severn</hi>'s Mouth into <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants boaſt much of the Antiquity of their firſt Cathedral, which they pretend had Biſhops and Preachers here <hi>Anno</hi> 189: The <hi>firſt</hi> Cathedral, we ſay; for, it has been, as reported, thrice deſtroy'd by Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> gave this City and Caſtle to the famous <hi>Robert Fitz-Hammon,</hi> afterwards Lord of <hi>Glamorgan. Edol,</hi> one of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobles, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended King <hi>Vortigern</hi> to the Congreſs appointed by <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> was Earl of this Place. He was a Man of great perſonal Strength, and ſeeing the <hi>Saxons</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth their conceal'd Weapons, he diſarm'd one of them, and fought valiantly; but being overpower'd by Numbers, he eſcap'd to this City, after having kill'd 70 <hi>Saxons</hi> with his own Hands. Afterwards, in a Battle fought againſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> near the River <hi>Don,</hi> he fix'd his Eye upon <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> and never quitted him, till he took him Priſoner, and ſtruck off his Head.</p>
            <p>In the little Iſle of <hi>Alney,</hi> near this Town, the famous ſingle Combat was fought between <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> and <hi>Canute</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> for the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in Sight of both their Armies.</p>
            <p>The City is governed by a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, and 24 Common-council-men. It has alſo an High-Steward, (who is uſually a Nobleman) and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder. They are allow'd the higheſt Marks of magiſtratical Honour, Scarlet Gowns, the Sword, and Cap of Maintenance, and 4 Sergeants at Mace. Here are 12 Companies, the Maſters whereof attend the Mayor on all publick Occaſions in their Gowns,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0141100402:293"/>
and with Streamers. It has a large Quay and Wharf on the River for Trade, and a Cuſtom-houſe. Here is alſo a Town-hall for the Aſſizes and publick Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which they call the <hi>Booth-hall,</hi> and great Part of the Caſtle is ſtill ſtanding.</p>
            <p>The firſt Proteſtant Biſhop of this Church was that truly Reverend and Religious Divine, Dr. <hi>John Hooper,</hi> who was burnt to Death in the Cemetery of his own Cathedral, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Whiſpering-place in this Cathedral formerly paſs'd for a kind of Wonder among the Vulgar; but ſince, Experience has taught the eaſily-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Reaſon of the Thing; and there is now the like in the Church of <hi>St. Paul, London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is great Proviſion for the Poor by Hoſpitals; particularly <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Hoſpital maintains 54 Men and Women, to whom belong a Miniſter, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and Surgeon. And Sir <hi>Thomas Rich,</hi> Bart. a Native of this Place, gave 6000<hi>l.</hi> by Will, for a <hi>Blue-Coat</hi> Hoſpital, wherein are educated 20 poor Boys; and 10 poor Men and 10 Women are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and cloath'd annually. Beſides theſe and three more, there are many Benefactions to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage young Tradeſmen, and place out Boys Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. And they have lately erected an Infirmary here, after the laudable Example of that of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Laſſington,</hi> near <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> are found certain Stones about the Breadth of a Silver Peny, and Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Half-crown, called <hi>Aſtroites</hi> or Star-ſtones, being fine-pointed like a Star, and flat. They are of a greyiſh Colour, and the flat Sides are naturally finely engraven, as it were. But I have taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe before.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Glouceſter</hi> we kept Eaſtward, and ſoon came to <hi>Cheltenham,</hi> a Market-town, where is ſtill a pretty good Trade carried on in Malt, but not ſo conſiderable as formerly. Here is a good Church in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0141100402:294"/>
the Form of a Croſs, with Ayles on each Side, and a Spire riſing in the Middle, noted for a good Ring of Bells. But what is more remarkable is, that the Miniſter is to be nominated by, and muſt be a Fellow of, <hi>Jeſus-College, Oxon,</hi> (tho' the Vicarage is but 40<hi>l.</hi> a Year) but approv'd of by the Earl of <hi>Gainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>; and he can't hold it more than ſix Years. Here is a Free-ſchool, an Hoſpital, and ſome other Charities.</p>
            <p>The Mineral Waters lately diſcovered at <hi>Chelten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which are of the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Kind, are what will make this Place ſtill more and more remarkable, and frequented. An eminent Phyſician has obliged me with the following Account of their Nature, and Qualities.</p>
            <p>Theſe Waters, he obſerves, were firſt found out by the Flocks of all the neighbouring Pigeons going conſtantly thither to provoke their Appetites, as well as to quench the uncommon Thirſt of theſe ſalacious hot Birds. I have been informed, ſays he, by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Credit and Experience, who had made all the common Trials on them, and obſerved their Effects on many Perſons of various Conſtitutions, and in different Diſtempers, who had drank them, That, on Evaporation, they were found to contain, in a Gallon, eight Drachms of a nitrous Salt, with two Drachms of an alcalious Earth: That they were compounded of a large Quantity of Nitre, to which they owed their purgative Virtue; a light Sulphur, which the fetid Dejections manifeſted; and a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Steel, diſcoverable by a tranſparent blue Colour, when mix'd with an Infuſion of Nut-galls. Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Spirits have no Effect on them; but they fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Acids. He further adds, That there might be found ſome other Materials in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, perhaps, if more minutely examined and tortured: but that theſe mentioned Principles were evident and inconteſtable, and were ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0141100402:295"/>
for all their Effects and Operation; the others (if there be any) being of little Efficacy. In the Operation they empty the Bowels according to their Doſe, but gently, mildly, and eaſily, without Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Nauſea, Gripes, or cauſing great Lowneſs, far beyond any artificial Purges whatſoever. They give a good Appetite, an eaſy Digeſtion, and quiet Nights, in all Nephritick and Gouty Caſes, when not under the Fit; in all Rheumatick, Scrophulous, Scorbutic, or Leprous Caſes; but eſpecially in Spermatic, Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or Haemorrhoidal Caſes, he thinks them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and not to be match'd. In a Word, in all Inflammatory Caſes of whatever Kind, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Part, he thinks them one of the moſt ſalutary Means which can be uſed. Thoſe of pretty ſtrong Nerves, and firm Conſtitutions, bear them with high Spirits, great Pleaſure, and Profit; but they do not at all ſuit with thoſe of weak Nerves, Paralytick, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriack, or Hyſterick Diſorders, or thoſe who are ſubject to any kind of Fits, Cramps, or Convulſions: they ruffle ſuch too much, as generally all Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives do. He thinks they have a great Affinity to the <hi>Scarborough</hi> Waters, and might do great Cures in moſt Chronical Diſtempers, if Exerciſe, and a proper Regimen, were directed with them.</p>
            <p>Following the Road towards <hi>Warwick</hi> directly, we arriv'd at <hi>Winchcomb,</hi> a ſmall Market-town, ſituate in a Bottom, in the midſt of good Paſture and Arable Lands, but of no great Account. The Church is a good Building, hath two Ayles, a large Chancel, and a lofty Tower adorn'd with Battlements and Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. It is remarkable, that it is a Curacy worth no more than 10<hi>l.</hi> a Year, tho' the Impropriation is worth 300<hi>l.</hi> annually. Here was formerly a very rich Abbey, whereof the Abbot was Mitred, founded by <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mercia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we turned from the Road, and ſtruck N.W. to <hi>Tewkſbury,</hi> encompaſſed with 4 Rivers; the <hi>Avon</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0141100402:296"/>
and <hi>Carran</hi> on the N. the <hi>Severn</hi> on the W. and the <hi>Swyliate</hi> on the S. 'Tis govern'd by 2 Bailiffs, and 24 Burgeſſes; and its Neighbourhood to <hi>Cotſwold-Downs</hi> makes the Cloathing Trade flouriſh here. It is a large and very populous Town, ſituate upon the <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> River <hi>Avon,</hi> ſo call'd to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Briſtol Avon,</hi> and others. The Town was long famous for its Muſtard-balls, as alſo for a great Manufacture of Stockens; as are alſo <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in this County, and <hi>Perſhore</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great old Church at <hi>Tewkſbury</hi> may be called one of the largeſt Churches in <hi>England,</hi> that is not Collegiate or Cathedral. It is very high, has two ſpacious Ayles, a ſtately Tower, and a large Chancel. The Communion-Table is one intire Marble Stone near 14 Feet long, and 3 and ½ broad.</p>
            <p>The Town is famous for the deciſive Battle fought between the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. of the latter Houſe, who was Conqueror.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Tewkſbury</hi> lies on the Borders of <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> we ſoon entered that County, and came to <hi>Upton,</hi> an antient Market-Town of ſome Note upon the <hi>Severn,</hi> over which it has a good Bridge. <hi>Roman</hi> Coins are frequently dug up here.</p>
            <p>On the Left, Weſtward of this Town, and which parts this County from that of <hi>Hereford,</hi> are <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> Hills, which conſiſt of large Mountains, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly high and lofty, gradually riſing one above another for about 7 Miles together. On theſe Hills are two Villages, call'd <hi>Great Malvern</hi> and <hi>Little Malvern,</hi> at the Diſtance of about Two Miles from each other, each having had formerly an Abbey of <hi>Benedictines,</hi> the laſt lying in a diſmal Cavity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Hills. On the very Top of theſe Hills may be ſeen the Ruins of a prodigious Ditch, which <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> dug, to ſeparate his Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0141100402:297"/>
from thoſe of the Church of <hi>Hereford.</hi> On theſe Hills are 2 Medicinal Springs, called <hi>Holy Wells:</hi> one is good for the Eyes, and putrid fetid Livers; and the other for Cancers.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Upton</hi> we travelled North-eaſt, and came to <hi>Perſhore,</hi> which lies on the lower <hi>London</hi> Road to <hi>Worceſter:</hi> it is ſaid to be ſo called from the great Number of Pear-trees, which thrive plentifully here. It is a pleaſant Market-Town lying on the <hi>Avon,</hi> and famous for the Stocken Trade, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</p>
            <p>Eaſtward of this Town ſtands <hi>Eveſham,</hi> ſituate on a gentle Aſcent from the ſame River, over which it hath a Bridge of 7 ſtately Arches. It is an antient Mayor-town, and has the Privilege to try Felons. It is memorable for the deciſive Battle, wherein <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> and the Barons were defeated by Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> afterwards King <hi>Edward</hi> I. who thereby releaſed his Father out of Captivity. Here are 2 Churches, with ſmall Spire Steeples; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them has any Bells, which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to a famous Tower built by Abbot <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and ſtands near theſe Churches.</p>
            <p>All around this Town lies that fruitful and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Country, call'd from this Place, <hi>The Vale of Eveſham,</hi> which runs all along the Banks of the <hi>Avon,</hi> from <hi>Tewkſbury</hi> to <hi>Perſhore,</hi> and to <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> in the South Part of <hi>Warwickſhire</hi>; which River is ſo far navigable.</p>
            <p>The Pariſh Church of <hi>Stratford</hi> is very old. In it we ſaw the Monument of the inimitable <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare,</hi> whoſe Dramatick Performances ſet him at the Head of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Theatre, and will make him renown'd to the End of Time. His Buſto is in the Wall on the North-ſide of the Church, and a flat Grave-ſtone covers the Body, in the Ayle juſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; on which Grave-ſtone theſe Lines are written:
<q>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0141100402:298"/>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Good Friend, for Jeſus' ſake, forbear</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>To move the Duſt that reſteth here.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Bleſt be the Man that ſpares theſe Stones;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And curſt be he, that moves my Bones!</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Over the <hi>Avon</hi> at <hi>Stratford</hi> is built a fair Stone Bridge of 14 Arches, with a long Cauſeway at the Weſt End of it, wall'd on both Sides.</p>
            <p>The Navigation of this River <hi>Avon</hi> is an exceeding Advantage to all this Part of the Country, and alſo to the Commerce of the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> For by this River they drive a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead, and, in a Word, all heavy, Goods which are uſually carried by Water almoſt as far as <hi>Warwick</hi>; and in Return, the Corn, and eſpecially Cheeſe, are carried back from <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to <hi>Briſtol</hi>; for <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> Cheeſe is excellent of the kind, and this County drives a great Trade in it.</p>
            <p>This Vale extending itſelf in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and under the Ridge of little Mountains call'd <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> is there call'd the Vale of <hi>Red-horſe.</hi> All the Grounds, put together, make a moſt pleaſant Corn Country, eſpecially remarkable for the Goodneſs of the Air, and Fertility of the Soil.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Stretford,</hi> on the Borders of this County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> is <hi>Alceſter,</hi> a Market-town, much frequented by Dealers in Corn: it is of great Antiquity; as appears by old Foundations of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made of <hi>Roman</hi> Brick, and Gold, Silver and Braſs Coins found here. The old <hi>Roman</hi> Way, called <hi>Ikenild-ſtreet,</hi> paſſes thro' the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glouceſterſhire</hi> muſt not be paſſed over, without ſome Account of another pleaſant and fruitful Vale, which croſſes part of the Country, from Eaſt to Weſt, on that Side of the <hi>Cotſwold,</hi> and which is called <hi>Stroud-water</hi>; famous not only for the fineſt Cloths, but for dying thoſe Cloths of the beautifuleſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0141100402:299"/>
Scarlets, and other grand Colours, that are any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>England,</hi> perhaps in any Part of the World. Here I ſaw Two Pieces of Broad-cloth made, one Scarlet, the other Crimſon in Grain, which were ſent as Preſents, the one to the late King <hi>George,</hi> whilſt Elector, and the other to his preſent Majeſty, which were very graciouſly accepted. The Cloth was valued at 45<hi>s. per</hi> Yard, and was well worth it; for nothing ſo rich of that kind had been ever made in <hi>England</hi> before, as I was informed.</p>
            <p>The Clothiers lie all along the Banks of this River, for near 20 Miles, and in the Town of <hi>Stroud,</hi> which lies in the middle of it, as alſo at <hi>Paynſwick,</hi> which I have mentioned before. The River makes its Way to the <hi>Severn,</hi> about Five Miles below <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Tewkſbury,</hi> North, it is 12 Miles to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> along the Banks of the <hi>Severn,</hi> where I was wonderfully delighted with the <hi>Hedge-rows,</hi> lin'd all the Way with Apple and Pear-trees, full of Fruit, and thoſe ſo common, that any Paſſengers, as they travel the Road, may gather and eat what they pleaſe. Here alſo, as well as in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> you meet with Cyder in the Publick-houſes, ſold as Beer and Ale is in other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and as cheap.</p>
            <p>We ſaw at a Diſtance, in a moſt agreeable Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Seat of Sir <hi>Herbert Perrot Pakington,</hi> a Baronet of a very antient Family.</p>
            <p>On the other Side of the <hi>Severn,</hi> at <hi>Whitley-court,</hi> five Miles from <hi>Bewdly,</hi> and ſeven from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Foley</hi> has a Seat, ſituate in a large Park.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the <hi>Branonium</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſeems to have been built by them to curb the <hi>Silures</hi> on the other Side of the <hi>Severn,</hi> and in Imitation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name the <hi>Britons</hi> called it <hi>Caer Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi> It is ſituate in a Valley on the <hi>Severn,</hi> which tho' generally rapid elſewhere, glides on here very gently. It is a large, populous, antient, well-built
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0141100402:300"/>
City, and the beſt paved in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Foregate-ſtreet</hi> is the moſt regular and beautiful that can be ſeen out of <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Guild-hall</hi> is a very fine Building; but the Statues on the Outſide diſgrace it.</p>
            <p>There is a good old Stone Bridge over the <hi>Severn,</hi> which ſtands exceeding high from the Surface of the Water, and has a Tower upon it, ſaid to be built by the <hi>Romans.</hi> But as the Stream of the <hi>Severn</hi> is contracted here by the Buildings on either Side, there is evident Occaſion ſometimes for the Height of the Bridge, the Waters riſing to an incredible Degree in the Winter-time.</p>
            <p>The Commandery here formerly belonging to <hi>St. John's of Jeruſalem,</hi> is now poſſeſſed by Mr. <hi>Wylde,</hi> and is a fine old Houſe of Timber, in the Form of a Court. The Hall, roof'd with <hi>Iriſh</hi> Oak, makes one Side of it, built for the Reception of Pilgrims. The Windows are adorn'd with Imagery, and Coats Armorial of ſtained Glaſs. It ſtands juſt without the South Gate of the City in the <hi>London</hi> Road, where the Heat of the famous Battle happen'd between King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>; and they frequently find Bones of the Slain, on digging in the Garden. Above in the Park is to be ſeen a great Work of Four Baſtions, called <hi>the Royal Mount,</hi> whence a <hi>Vallum</hi> and Ditch run both ways to incompaſs this Side of the City. Here, 'tis probable, the Storm began, when the Royaliſts were driven back into the City with great Slaughter, and the King eſcaped being made a Priſoner in the narrow Street at this Gate, by a loaded Cart of Hay pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely overthrown, which gave him time to retire at the oppoſite Gate to <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> or <hi>White Lady's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Mile and half above the South Gate, on the Top of the Hall, is the celebrated <hi>Perrywood,</hi> where <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Army lay, and which affords a fine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect over the County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0141100402:301"/>The Cathedral is an antient Building. The Body of the Church makes no extraordinary Appearance on the Outſide. The Tower is low, without any Spire, only four very ſmall Pinacles on the Corners; and yet it has ſome little Beauty in it, more than the Church itſelf. The upper Part has ſome Images in it, but decay'd by Time. In it is bury'd the reſtleſs King <hi>John</hi>; not where now his Monument ſtands, which is in the Choir, before the high Altar; but under a little Stone before the Altar of the Eaſtermoſt Wall of the Church. On each Side of him, on the Ground, lie the Effigies of the two Biſhops, his chief Saints, <hi>Wolſton</hi> and <hi>Oſwald,</hi> from whoſe Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood he hoped to be ſafe. The Image of the King probably lay here alſo upon the Ground, now elevated upon a Tomb in the ſaid Choir.</p>
            <p>On the South Side of the High Altar is a large and handſome Stone Chapel over the Monument of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who died at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> as his Tomb-ſtone ſpecifies, <hi>Anno</hi> 1502; and whoſe Relict <hi>Catharine</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. marrying, after 20 Years Wedlock, was divorced from, to make way for <hi>Anna Bolen.</hi> The Choir of this Chapel is exquiſite Workmanſhip; but ſuffered much in the late Civil Wars.</p>
            <p>Here is alſo, among other noted Monuments, one for that famous Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who dancing before <hi>Edward</hi> III. in his great Hall at <hi>Windſor,</hi> dropt her Garter, which the King taking up, honoured it ſo much (as the idle Story goes) as to make it the denominating Enſign of <hi>The moſt Noble Order of the Garter</hi>; but this I have refuted under my Account of <hi>Windſor.</hi> Tho', that the Counteſs did drop her Garter, is Fact; and the King might gallantly, to ſilence the Jeſts and Railleries of the Court, wear it during the Entertainment, inſtead of his Garter of the Order. But the Motto was given
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0141100402:302"/>
in Alluſion to the Order of Knighthood, and not of the Garter.</p>
            <p>The Monument is very fine, and there is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in it; that there are ſeveral Angels cut in Stone about it, ſtrewing Garters over the Tomb.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other antient Monuments in this Church, which I have not Room to mention.</p>
            <p>The Cloiſters are very perfect, and the Chapter-houſe is large, ſupported, as to its arched Roof, by one umbilical Pillar. 'Tis now become a Library, is well furniſh'd, and has many good antient MSS.</p>
            <p>There is a large old Gatehouſe ſtanding, and near it the Caſtle with a very high artificial Mount or Keep, nigh the River.</p>
            <p>The Bridge I have mention'd has ſix Arches, and the Banks of the <hi>Severn</hi> look very beautiful on each Side, being inriched with pleaſant Meadows.</p>
            <p>This City is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen. It has Two Chamberlains, a Recorder, a Town-clerk, Two Coroners, a Sword-bearer, Four Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants at Mace, and a Sheriff; being, like <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> a County of itſelf, divided into Seven Wards, in which are Twelve Pariſh Churches.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants are generally eſteem'd rich, being full of Buſineſs, occaſion'd chiefly by the Cloathing-trade, of which the City and the Country round carries on a great Share, as well for the <hi>Turkey</hi> as the Home Trade. The Number of Hands, which it imploys in this Town and adjoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng Villages, in Spinning, Carding, Rowing, Fulling, Weaving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is almoſt incredible. One Part of the Town is wholly poſſeſſed by <hi>Welſh</hi> People, who ſpeak their own Language, and are imploy'd in this Manufacture. So that this City, which was formerly ſo great a Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the great ones of that Principality, now adminiſters Subſiſtence to a vaſt Number of the meaner ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0141100402:303"/>It is adorn'd by a capacious and beautiful Structure, called <hi>the Publick Workhouſe</hi>; in which Children of both Sexes are trained up to the Knowlege of Trade, and the Practice of Religion and Virtue; by whoſe Labour alſo the Aged and Decrepid are ſupported. This laudable Inſtitution continued ſeveral Years to the great Benefit of the City, till at laſt the Guardians of it having contracted a Debt of upwards of 300<hi>l.</hi> they returned the Poor back to their reſpective Pariſhes; and the whole Charity being fruſtrated, and put an End to, the Corporation let out the Building for a Hop-market, Warehouſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pay the incurr'd Debt, either Principal or Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Hereupon their worthy Repreſentative <hi>Samuel Sandys,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and other Gentlemen, procured an Act of Parliament for reſtoring it to its firſt laudable End; which Act took place from <hi>June</hi> 1730, and will be a laſting Monument to the Honour of the diſintereſted and publick-ſpirited Gentleman, to whoſe unwearied Application, and inflexible Reſolution, it was owing: for it muſt be obſerved, that alienated Charities are ſome of the hardeſt things in the World to be reſtored.</p>
            <p>Oppoſite to this Workhouſe, <hi>Robert Berkley,</hi> of <hi>Spetchley,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> erected a fine Hoſpital for Twelve poor Men, and gave 2000<hi>l.</hi> to build it, and 4000<hi>l.</hi> to endow it.</p>
            <p>Here are beſides Three Grammar-ſchools, and Seven Alms-houſes, all liberally indow'd. <hi>St. Nicolas</hi> Church, in this City, has been lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, and is a neat and commodious Edifice.</p>
            <p>And the Church of <hi>All-ſaints</hi> in this Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo ruinous a Condition, that Part of it actually fell down; and the reſt being ready to fall, an Act paſſed, Seſſ. 1737-8, for taking down and rebuilding the ſame.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Worceſter</hi> I made ſome Excurſions, to viſit the Towns and Country Northward; and firſt came
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0141100402:304"/>
to <hi>Droitwych,</hi> a corporate Bailiwick-town, which has Four Churches, and is pretty wealthy. 'Tis famous for excellent White Salt, which is made here from the Summer to the Winter Solſtice; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but they may make Salt all the Year long, but they fear to over-ſtock the Market. It appears, by <hi>Doomſday-book,</hi> they made Salt here before the Conqueſt. The Salt Springs are very good, and productive of Plenty of Brine; and the Town lies on the River <hi>Salwarp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proceeding directly on, in the Road, we arrived at <hi>Broomſgrove,</hi> a large Bailiwick-town, likewiſe on the River <hi>Salwarp,</hi> where the Clothing-trade is pretty briſkly carried on. It is the Centre of Four Roads; one leads to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi>; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to <hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London</hi>; a Third to <hi>Worceſter</hi>; and the Fourth to <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Spetchley</hi> was <hi>St. Oſwald</hi>'s Hoſpital, demoliſhed in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> after the Reſtoration, recover'd much of the Poſſeſſions, and erected a fair and large Hoſpital, which comfortably maintains Twelve poor Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> is a Town in this County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> very conſiderable for its Woollen Trade, particularly the Weaving of what they call Lindſey-woolſey, in which the Inhabitants are almoſt wholly imploy'd. It is a large, but yet compact and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Town, ſituated on the <hi>Stour,</hi> and govern'd by a Bailiff, Twelve Capital Burgeſſes, Twenty-five Common-council-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In its Church is a croſs-legg'd Monument of Sir <hi>Thomas Acton.</hi>

               <hi>Stourbridge</hi> is alſo ſituate upon the River <hi>Stour,</hi> over which it has a very good Bridge, whence its Name. This Town deals greatly in Glaſs Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of all Sorts, and alſo in Iron Works of all Sorts; and is vaſtly improved of late Years, both in Houſes and Inhabitants.

               <hi>Birmingham</hi> is a very populous Town, and full of Iron Manufactories, eſpecially of the ſmaller Sorts; in which the Inhabitants ſo greatly excel, that their Works are carried to all Parts of the World in great Quantities. The Town is, of late Years, greatly improved and inlarged by many new Buildings both publick and private; particularly a new Church built by virtue of an Act of Parliament paſſed in the 7th of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> which is dedicated to St. <hi>Philip.</hi> This Town is in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> on the Borders of this County, ſituated on the Side of a Hill, and has a moſt plentiful Market.</p>
            <p>A little below <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Weſtward, the <hi>Severn</hi> receives a River of a long deep Courſe, which comes from <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> called the <hi>Teme,</hi> on which ſtands a ſmall Market-town called <hi>Tenbury,</hi> but of little Note. I paſſed this River formerly in my Way to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> at <hi>Broadway,</hi> a little Village; but now I went by the Way of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> on the Side of <hi>Shropſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Courſe we ſaw Two fine Seats not very far from the <hi>Severn, viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Foley</hi>'s, and the Earl of <hi>Bradford</hi>'s, as we did before a moſt delicious Houſe, belonging to the Lord <hi>Conway.</hi> Indeed this Part of the County, and all the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> is filled with fine Seats of the Nobility and Gentry, which we have not Room to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bewdley</hi> or <hi>Beau-lieu,</hi> i. e. <hi>fine Place,</hi> ſaid to be ſo called from its pleaſant and delightful Situation upon the Side of a Hill declining to the <hi>Severn,</hi> is a ſmall Bailiff Market-town, well ſupplied with Corn, Malt, Leather, and Caps, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen buy,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0141100402:306"/>
called <hi>Monmouth Caps,</hi> and noted for the Palace which King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. built here for his Son Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> called <hi>Tickenhall.</hi> It had a very fine Park about it, which, with the Houſe, was deſtroy'd by the furious Enthuſiaſts in the Civil War.</p>
            <p>A Mile off is <hi>Ribsford,</hi> the Seat of Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherbury,</hi> pleaſantly ſurrounded with Woods. Here is a good Picture of <hi>William</hi> the Firſt Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ends of the Hills towards the River are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Rocks: and <hi>Blackſton-hill</hi> has an Hermitage cut out of it, with a Chapel, and ſeveral Apartments. Near it is a pretty Rock upon the Edge of the Water, covered with Oaks, and many curious Plants.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Cherbury</hi> Park is the Pariſh of <hi>Roch,</hi> where the famous <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Oak ſtood, ſo called from a Conference held under it by <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops, about the Celebration of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and preaching God's Word, and adminiſtring Baptiſm after the Rites of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops refuſed.</p>
            <p>I thought once to have returned to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſo proceeded to <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and down to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and ſo round the Coaſt of <hi>Wales.</hi> But being deſirous to take in, firſt, the South Part of <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> I followed the <hi>Severn</hi> up North, and came to <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> a very antient and noted Town, ſaid to be built by Queen <hi>Aethelfleda,</hi> in the Time of the Heptarchy: it conſiſts of Two Towns, the High and the Low, which are ſeparated by the <hi>Severn,</hi> but united by a fair Stone Bridge of Seven Arches, which hath a Gate and Gate-houſe. The Situation is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, the Air healthy, the Proſpect delightful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Trade. It hath been fortified with Walls and a Caſtle, which are now in Ruins; and the Area in the laſt is converted to a fine Bowling-green. The Streets are many, and well paved. It is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a Bailiff, Twenty-four Aldermen, and other
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0141100402:307"/>
inferior Officers. It is noted for good Gun-makers and its Stocken Manufacture. It has a well-repleniſhed Market, and Five Fairs annually, Two whereof hold Three Days, which are much reſorted to, and abound with Horſes, Black Cattle, Sheep, Butter, Cheeſe, Bacon, Linen Cloth, and Hops, in great Plenty. Here are Two Churches, and tho' the Pariſhes are large, and the Town very populous, are very indifferently indowed, and ſo is the Free-ſchool. There is a hollow Way cut thro' the Rock, leading from the high Town to the Bridge, of the Depth of 20 Feet, in ſome Parts of it, and likewiſe many Vaults and Dwellings are hewn out of the Rock.</p>
            <p>From hence we advanced in the direct Road to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and came to <hi>Great Wenlock,</hi> an antient incorporated Town, governed by a Bailiff and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes; but noted for nothing extraordinary.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> for my Obſervation at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Wales</hi> thro' <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> we turn'd ſhort here, and fell down Southward to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> famed more for its Beauty than Antiquity; for it ſeems, the Caſtle, which was ſo truly magnificent, was built by <hi>Roger de Montgomery</hi> in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Time.</p>
            <p>But before I ſpeak more of this Caſtle, I ſhall obſerve, that on the Extremity of this County, in a kind of Promontory, which runs in between <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meryſhire</hi> and <hi>Radnorſhire,</hi> upon the <hi>Clun,</hi> lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Biſhops Caſtle,</hi> a ſmall Market Bailiwick Town; and not very far from it, juſt at the Entrance into <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> is a noted Place called <hi>Biſhops<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ott</hi>; where is an Acre of Ground ſurrounded with an Intrenchment. The <hi>Clun</hi> meets the <hi>Teme</hi> at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and both, united, run to <hi>Clebury,</hi> a ſmall Town on the Borders of <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> where it falls, as I mentioned before, into the <hi>Severn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Ludlow</hi> ſhews plainly in its Decay, what it was in its flouriſhing Eſtate: it is the Palace of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> in Right of his Principality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0141100402:308"/>Its Situation is indeed moſt beautiful; there is a moſt ſpacious Plain or Lawn in its Front, which formerly continued near Two Miles; but much of it is now incloſed. The Country round it is exceeding pleaſant, fertile, populous, and the Soil rich; nothing can be added by Nature, to make it a Place fit for a Royal Palace. It is built in the North-weſt Angle of the Town upon a Rock, commanding a delightful Proſpect Northward; and on the Weſt is ſhaded by a lofty Hill, and waſhed by the River. The Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of great Height and Thickneſs, with Towers at convenient Diſtances. That Half which is within the Walls of the Town, is ſecured with a deep Ditch; the other is founded on a ſolid Rock. A Chapel here has abundance of Coats of Arms upon the Panels, as has the Hall, together with Lances, Spears, Firelocks, and old Armour.</p>
            <p>It will be no Wonder, that this noble Caſtle is in the very Perfection of Decay, when we acquaint our Readers, that the preſent Inhabitants live upon the Sale of the antient Materials. All the fine Courts, the Royal Apartments, Halls, and Rooms of State, lie open, abandon'd, and ſome of them falling down; for ſince the Courts of the Preſident and Marches are taken away, here is nothing that requires the Attendance of any publick People; ſo that Time, the great Devourer of the Works of Men, begins to eat into the very Stone Walls, and to ſpread the Face of Ruin upon the whole Fabrick. Over ſeveral of the Stable-doors are the Arms of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Ludlow</hi> is likewiſe fortify'd with Walls, thro' which are Seven Gates. It is well-built, and a Place of good Trade; but, to be ſure, it is not the better for the ruinous State of the Caſtle, and the aboliſhing of the Court held there for the Marches. It ſtands on the Edge of the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0141100402:309"/>
               <hi>Shropſhire</hi> and <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> but is itſelf in the firſt.</p>
            <p>On the South-ſide of the Town runs the <hi>Teme,</hi> over which is a good Bridge. The River has ſeveral Dams acroſs it, in the Nature of Cataracts, whereby abundance of Mills are turn'd; and great is the Roar of the ſuperfluous Waters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ludlow</hi> has a very good Church with an handſome Tower, and a pleaſant Ring of Six Bells. The Windows are full of painted Glaſs pretty intire.</p>
            <p>There are ſome old Monuments of the Lords Preſidents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and an Inſcription upon the North Wall of the Choir, relating to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> elder Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who died here, and in this Spot his Bowels were depoſited. It is ſaid, That his Heart was taken up ſome time ago in a leaden Box.</p>
            <p>In the Eaſtern Angle of the Choir is a Cloſet, antiently called <hi>The Godhouſe,</hi> where the Prieſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their conſecrated Utenſils. The Window is ſtrongly barred on the Outſide. The Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to St. <hi>Laurence</hi>: and in the Market-place is a Ciſtern or Conduit, on the Top of which is a long Stone Croſs, bearing a Niche, in which is the Image of that Saint.</p>
            <p>Weſt of the Church was a College, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a private Houſe. There was a rich Priory out of the Town, on the North Side of which are but few Ruins to be ſeen, except a ſmall Church, which formerly belonged to it. The <hi>Welſh</hi> call this Town <hi>Lye Twyſoy,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Prince's Court.</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls the River <hi>Teme</hi> the <hi>Tem'd,</hi> and another River which joins it juſt at this Town, the <hi>Corve,</hi> whence the rich flat Country below the Town is call'd <hi>Corveſdale.</hi> It is governed by Two Bailiffs, Twelve Aldermen, a Recorder, Twenty-five Common-council-men, and other inferior Officers; and has the particular Privilege of trying and executing
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0141100402:310"/>
Criminals. It has an Alms-houſe for 30 poor People.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. eſtabliſh'd here the Court of the Preſident and Council of the Marches, before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and all Cauſes of <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> or of Civil Right, were try'd here, before the Lord Preſident and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; but this Court, being grown a great Grievance to the Publick, was intirely taken away by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the firſt Year of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Ludlow,</hi> we took our Courſe ſtill due South to <hi>Lemſter,</hi> or <hi>Leominſter,</hi> a large Market-town on the River <hi>Lug,</hi> over which it hath ſeveral Bridges. 'Tis governed by a Bailiff. The Church, which is very large, has been in a manner rebuilt, and is now very beautiful. This Town is noted for its fine Wool, and the beſt Wheat, and conſequently the fineſt Bread; and alſo for the beſt Barley, whence <hi>Lemſter Bread,</hi> and <hi>Weobly Ale,</hi> are become a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial Saying.</p>
            <p>It is a Town of briſk Trade in Wool, Hat-making, Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lies in a Valley exceedingly luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant. Three Rivers of a very ſwift Current go thro' the Town, beſides others very near. The Inhabitants make great uſe of theſe by Mills, and other Machinery in the various Branches of their Trade. On the North-ſide of the Church was a conſiderable Priory, Two Ayles of which belong now to the Church, and Two others of more lightſome Work have been added. The Mayor has a long black Rod to walk with, tipt with Silver. There are ſome poor Remains of the Priory, chiefly a little Chapel, which probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Prior's Family. Underneath it runs a pretty Rivulet, which us'd to grind his Corn, now converted to a Fulling-mill. Near it are very large Ponds for Fiſh, which uſed to furniſh the Monks on faſting Days. There was a fine Gate-houſe, pull'd
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0141100402:311"/>
down not long ago, near the <hi>Ambry</hi> or <hi>Almery</hi> Cloſe, where they gave their Scraps away to the Poor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pembridge, Weobly,</hi> and <hi>Kyneton</hi> lie South-weſt of <hi>Lemſter,</hi> and form in their Situation a kind of Triangle. They are all Market-Towns, and the firſt is pretty conſiderable for the Cloathing Trade; the ſecond for Ale; but the third for nothing that I know of.</p>
            <p>The County on our right, as we came from <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> is very fruitful and pleaſant, and is called the Hundred of <hi>Wigmore,</hi> from which the Earl of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> takes the Title of Baron. Here we ſaw the two antient Caſtles of <hi>Brampton Brian,</hi> and <hi>Wigmore,</hi> both belonging to the late Earl's Grandfather, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Harley. Brampton</hi> is a ſtately Pile, but not kept in full Repair. The Parks are fine, and full of large Timber.</p>
            <p>We were now on the Borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> properly ſo called; for from the Windows of <hi>Brampton-Caſtle,</hi> you have a fair Proſpect into the County of <hi>Radnor,</hi> which is, as it were, under its Walls; nay, even this whole County of <hi>Hereford</hi> was a Part of <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſo deem'd for many Ages. The People of this County too boaſt, that they were a Part of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Silures,</hi> who for ſo many Ages withſtood the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, and could never be intirely conquer'd. They are a diligent and laborious People, chiefly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Huſbandry; and they boaſt, that they have the fineſt Wool, the beſt Hops, and the richeſt Cyder in all <hi>Britain</hi>; and poſſibly with ſome Reaſon; for the Wool about <hi>Leominſter,</hi> and in the Hundred of <hi>Wigmore,</hi> and the <hi>Golden Vale,</hi> as it is call'd for its Richneſs, on the Banks of the River <hi>Dove,</hi> (all in this County) is as fine as any in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>South-down</hi> Wool not excepted. As for <hi>Hops,</hi> they plant abundance all over this County, and they are very good. And for <hi>Cyder,</hi> it is the common Drink of the County, and is ſo very good, and ſo cheap, that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0141100402:312"/>
we never found fault, though we could get no other Drink for Twenty Miles together. Great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Cyder are ſent to <hi>London,</hi> even by Land-Carriage, though ſo very remote, which is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in its Favour beyond Contradiction.</p>
            <p>One would hardly expect ſo pleaſant and fruitful a Country as this, ſo near the barren Mountains of <hi>Wales</hi>; but 'tis certain, that not any of our Southern Counties, the Neighbourhood of <hi>London</hi> excepted, come up to the Fertility of this County.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Lemſter</hi> it is Ten Miles to <hi>Hereford,</hi> the chief City, not of this County only, but of all the Counties Weſt of the <hi>Severn.</hi> In the time of the late Civil Wars it was very ſtrong, and being well fortify'd, and as well defended, ſupported a tedious and very ſevere Siege; for beſides the Parliament's Forces, who could never reduce it, the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was call'd to the Work, who lay before it, till they laid above 4000 of their Bones there, and at laſt it was rather ſurrendered by the fatal Iſſue of the War, than by the Attack of the Beſiegers.</p>
            <p>It had before this Six Pariſh-churches; but Two of them were demoliſh'd at that time. It has an Hoſpital liberally endow'd for 12 poor People.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Hereford</hi> probably ſprung from the Ruins of the <hi>Roman Ariconium,</hi> now <hi>Kencheſter,</hi> three Miles off, higher up the River <hi>Wye,</hi> but not very near it, which may be a Reaſon for its Decay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kencheſter</hi> ſtands upon a little Brook, call'd the <hi>Ine,</hi> which thence encompaſſing the Walls of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> falls into the <hi>Wye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archenfield</hi> ſeems to retain the Name of <hi>Ariconium.</hi> Nothing remains of its Splendor, but a Piece of a Temple, probably, with a Nich which is Five Feet high, and Three broad within, built of Brick, Stone, and indiſſoluble Mortar. There are many large Foundations near it. A very fine <hi>Moſaick</hi> Floor, a few Years ago, was found intire, which was ſoon
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0141100402:313"/>
torn to Pieces by the ignorant Country-people. A Bath was here found by Sir <hi>John Hoſkyns</hi> about Seven Feet ſquare, the Pipes of Lead intire: thoſe of Brick were a Foot long, Three Inches ſquare, let ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially into one another; over theſe, I ſuppoſe, was a Pavement.</p>
            <p>This, as Dr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> obſerves, is an excellent Invention for heating a Room, and might well be introduced among us in Winter-time.</p>
            <p>In another Place is a Hollow, where burnt Wheat has been taken up. All around the City you may eaſily trace the Walls, ſome Stones being left every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, tho' over-grown by Hedges and Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees. The Situation of the Place is a gentle Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of a ſquariſh Form; the Earth black and rich, overgrown with Brambles, Oak-trees, full of Stones, Foundations, and Cavities, where they have been digging, and found many Coins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Colonel <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> has pav'd a Cellar with ſquare Bricks dug up here. The Earl of <hi>Coningſby</hi> has adorn'd the Floor of his Evidence-room with them.</p>
            <p>This City is overlook'd and ſhelter'd towards the North with a prodigious Mountain of ſteep Aſcent; on the Top ſtands a vaſt Camp, with Works altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inacceſſible, which is call'd <hi>Credon-hill.</hi> At the Summit, you are preſented with the moſt glorious and extenſive Proſpect, as far as <hi>St. Michael's Mount,</hi> in <hi>Monmouthſhire</hi>; crown'd with Two Tops, and of conſiderable Reſort among Zealots of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſuaſion, who believe this holy Hill was ſent hither by St. <hi>Patrick</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that it works Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in ſeveral Caſes.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, is the vaſt Black Mountain, which ſeparates <hi>Brecknockſhire</hi> from this County. The Town underneath appears like a little Copſe. <hi>Dinder-hill,</hi> whereon is a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, ſtands on the contrary Bank of the <hi>Wye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0141100402:314"/>And upon the <hi>Lug</hi> are <hi>Sutton-walls,</hi> another vaſt <hi>Roman</hi> Camp upon a Hill overlooking a beautiful Vale, which was the regal Reſidence of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King <hi>Offa</hi>; but chiefly remarkable for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of young King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> whom he allur'd thither under Pretext of courting his Daughter, and who was buried in the neighbouring Church of <hi>Marden,</hi> ſituate in a Marſh by the River-ſide. Hence his Body was afterwards convey'd to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and enſhrin'd; but the particular Place cannot be found.</p>
            <p>In the North Wing of the Cathedral of <hi>Hereford,</hi> is the Shrine, where the Body of <hi>Cantilupe,</hi> the great Miracle-monger in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited; which Wing was built by himſelf, and on the Wall his Picture is painted. All round are the Marks of Hooks, where the Banners, Lamps, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and the like Preſents were hung up. And the Riches of this Place were doubtleſs very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; for it is well guarded againſt the Aſſaults of Thieves. The Shrine is of Stone, carv'd round with Knights in Armour.</p>
            <p>The Church is very old and ſtately. The Spire is not high, but handſome, and there is a fine Tower at the Weſt End. The Roof, Ayles, and Chapel, have been added to the more antient Part by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Biſhops, as alſo the Towers, Cloiſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Choir, tho' plain, is handſome, and there is a very good Organ.</p>
            <p>The Chapter-houſe, which was very beautiful, was deſtroy'd in the Civil Wars. About Four Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are left ſtanding; and the Springing of the Stone Arches between, are of fine Ribwork, which compos'd the Roof, of that Sort of Architecture, wherewith <hi>King's-college-chapel</hi> was built. Two Windows were pull'd down by Biſhop <hi>Biſſe,</hi> which he us'd in new fitting up the Epiſcopal Palace. Under the Windows, in every Compartiment, was painted a King, Biſhop, Saint, Virgin, or the like; ſome
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0141100402:315"/>
of which were diſtinct enough, tho' ſo long expos'd to the Weather.</p>
            <p>Here are a great Number of Monuments of Biſhops, and many valuable Braſſes and Tombs.</p>
            <p>Between the Cathedral and Palace, is a moſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pile, built and roof'd with Stone, conſiſting of Two Chapels, one above the other; the upper dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Magdalen</hi>; the lower, which is ſome Steps under-ground, to St. <hi>Catharine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſtle was a noble Work, built by one of the <hi>Edwards</hi> before the Conqueſt, ſtrongly wall'd and ditch'd. There is a very lofty artificial Keep, having a Well fac'd with good Stone: and by the Side of the Ditch a Spring conſecrated to St. <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> with an old Stone Arch.</p>
            <p>Without the Walls are the Ruins of <hi>Black-Friers</hi> Monaſtery, and a pretty Stone Croſs intire; round which the Cloiſters were originally built, as now the Cloiſters of the Cathedral incloſe another ſuch. Theſe Croſſes were in the nature of a Pulpit, whence a Monk preach'd to the People in the open Air, as now practis'd in the Cloiſters of ſome Colleges in the Univerſities once a Year.</p>
            <p>The neighbouring Hill, call'd <hi>Dynmaur,</hi> or <hi>The great Hill,</hi> makes amends for the Tediouſneſs of climbing it, by the Pleaſure we receive from its woody Creſt, and extenſive Proſpect.</p>
            <p>At the City of <hi>Hereford,</hi> we could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Truth of the Story ſo famous, that the Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Gibſon</hi> has mention'd it in his Continuation of <hi>Camden,</hi> of the removing the Two great Stones near <hi>Sutton</hi>; which the People confirm'd to us. The Story is thus:</p>
            <p>Between <hi>Sutton</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> in a common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow call'd the <hi>Wergins,</hi> were plac'd Two large Stones for a Water-mark; one erected upright, and the other laid athwart. In the late Civil Wars, about the Year 1652, they remov'd to about twelveſcore
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0141100402:316"/>
Paces Diſtance, and nobody knew how; which gave occaſion to a vulgar Notion, That they were carried thither by the Devil. When they were ſet in their Places again, one of them requir'd nine Yoke of Oxen to draw it.</p>

               <hi>Lidbury</hi> lies Eaſtward of <hi>Hereford,</hi> near the South End of the <hi>Malvern</hi> Hills. It is a fine, well-built Market-town, ſituate in rich clayey Grounds, and much inhabited by Clothiers. Here is an Hoſpital for the Poor, well indowed.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Lidbury,</hi> is <hi>Colwal</hi>; near which, upon the Waſte, as a Countryman was digging a Ditch about his Cottage, he found a Crown or a Coronet of Gold, with Gems ſet deep in it. It was of a Size large enough to be drawn over the Arm with the Sleeve. The Stones of it are ſaid to have been ſo valuable, as to be ſold by a Jeweller for One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Five hundred Pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereford,</hi> tho' a large and populous City, may yet be ſaid to be old, mean-built, and very dirty, lying low, and on the Bank of the <hi>Wye,</hi> which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times incommodes them very much, by the violent Freſhes that come down from the Mountains of <hi>Wales</hi>; for all the Rivers of this County, except the <hi>Diffrin-Doe,</hi> come out of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing remarkable, which we muſt not omit, is, that the College ſtill retains its Foundation Laws, and the Reſidentiaries are oblig'd to Celibacy; but otherwiſe, they live a very happy, eaſy, and plentiful Life; being furniſh'd upon the Foot of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides their Eccleſiaſtical Stipends.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of the Year 1738, they began to pull down the old <hi>Gothick</hi> Chapel belonging to the Biſhop's Palace at <hi>Hereford,</hi> in order to erect a Pile in a politer Taſte, for the publick Service. The demoliſh'd Chapel was ſaid to be as old as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0141100402:317"/>Between <hi>Leominſter</hi> and this City, is another <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the Seat of the late Earl of <hi>Coningſby.</hi> That Lord was, from an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Peer, made an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, by his late Majeſty King <hi>George</hi> I. And having no Son, his Daughter was created by the ſame Prince in the Life-time of her Father, Baroneſs and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteſs <hi>Coningſby</hi> of <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> in order that her Deſcendants might be intitled to a Peerage. She marry'd Sir <hi>Michael Newton,</hi> Bart. and Knight of the <hi>Bath.</hi> This is a fine Seat built by <hi>Henry Bolin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> afterwards King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in the Form of a Caſtle, ſituate in a Valley upon a rapid River, under Coverture of <hi>Dynmaur.</hi> The Gardens are very pleaſant, terminated by vaſt Woods covering all the ſloping Side of the Hill. There is a plentiful Supply of Water, on all Sides of the Houſe, for Fountains, Baſins, and Canals. Within, are excellent Pictures of the Earl's Anceſtors and others, by <hi>Holben, Dobſon, Vandyke,</hi> Sir <hi>P. Lully,</hi> &amp;c. an Original of the Founder King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Ducheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Windows of the Chapel are well painted: there are ſome Statues of the <hi>Coningſbies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two new Stone Stair-caſes, after a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Method. The Record-room is at-top of a Tower arch'd with Stone, pav'd with <hi>Roman</hi> Brick, and has an Iron Door. From the Top of the Houſe goes a Stair-caſe, which, they ſay, has a ſubterraneous Conveyance into <hi>Dynmaur</hi> Wood.</p>
            <p>The Park is very fine, Eight Miles in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and contains about 1200 Head of Deer. There are extenſive Proſpects on one Side reaching into <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> on the other over the <hi>Welſh</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; Lawns, Groves, Canals, Hills and Plains. There is a Pool Three Quarters of a Mile long, very broad, and included between Two great Woods. The Dam, which forms it, and is made over a Valley, coſt, 800<hi>l.</hi> and was finiſh'd in a Fortnight by 200
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0141100402:318"/>
Hands. A new River is cut quite thro' the Park, the Chanel of which, for a long way together, is hewn out of the Rock. This ſerves to inrich vaſt Tracts of Lands, which before were barren. Here alſo are new Gardens and Canals laid out, and new Plantations of Timber in proper Places.</p>
            <p>Warrens, Decoys, Sheepwalks, Paſtures for Cattle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſupply the Houſe with all Sorts of Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Neceſſaries, without having recourſe to a Market.</p>
            <p>Weſtward of <hi>Hereford</hi> the <hi>Golden Vale</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, extends itſelf along the River <hi>Dore,</hi> which runs thro' the midſt of it, and is call'd by the <hi>Britons, Duf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frin Dore:</hi> it is call'd the <hi>Golden Vale,</hi> from its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Fertility in the Spring, when it is cover'd over with a yellow Livery of Flowers. It is encompaſſed with Hills, which are crown'd with Woods.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hereford,</hi> keeping the Bank of <hi>Wye</hi> as near as we could, we came to <hi>Roſs,</hi> a good old Town, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Cyder, a great Manufacture of Iron-ware, and its Trade on the River <hi>Wye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we came at about Eight Miles more into <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> formerly a <hi>Welſh,</hi> but now an <hi>Engliſh</hi> County, and to the Town of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> It is a Place of great Antiquity, and is fair, large, and well-built, ſituate at the Conflux of the <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Munnow,</hi> whence the Town has its Name; it ſtands in the Angle where the Rivers join, and has a Bridge over each River, and a third over the River <hi>Trothy,</hi> which comes in juſt below the other.</p>
            <p>This Town ſhews Marks of great Antiquity, and, by the Remains of Walls, Lines, Curtains, and Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it has been very ſtrong, and, by its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may be made ſo again. It is a Borough-town, govern'd by Two Bailiffs, Common-council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Town-clerk. It has a very conſiderable Corn-market. It was famed for the Strength of the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0141100402:319"/>
Caſtle in the Time of <hi>William</hi> I.; and is the Birth-place of our renown'd King <hi>Henry</hi> V. Conqueror of <hi>France</hi>; and likewiſe of one of our antient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>Jeoffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> a fabulous Writer. At preſent 'tis not very flouriſhing; yet it drives a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Trade with the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the <hi>Wye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This River having receiv'd Two large Streams, the <hi>Munnow,</hi> and the <hi>Trother,</hi> becomes a very noble River; and with a deep Chanel, and a full Current, hurries away towards the Sea, carrying alſo Veſſels of a conſiderable Burden hereabouts.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> has a fine Seat, call'd <hi>Troy-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lower down, upon the <hi>Wye</hi> in this Shire, ſtands <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> the Sea-port for all the Towns ſeated on this River and the <hi>Lug,</hi> and where their Commerce ſeems to centre. Hither Ships of good Burden may come up, and the Tide runs with the ſame impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Current as at <hi>Briſtol</hi>; the Flood riſing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily from Six Fathom, to Six and a half at <hi>Chepſtow</hi> Bridge, which is a noble one indeed, built of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and no leſs than 70 Feet high from the Surface of the Water, when the Tide is out. And that this was not a needleſs Height, was evident in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1738, when the Water roſe at the Bridge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 70 Feet, and very much damag'd it: one Man loſt above 130 Head of Cattle, which, with other Damages it did there, and in the adjacent Places, were computed at 7 or 8000<hi>l. Chepſtow</hi> has a well frequented Market, eſpecially for Corn. The Bridge, as half of it is in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> is maintained at the Expence of both Counties.</p>
            <p>Two Miles from this Town is the famous Paſſage over the <hi>Severn,</hi> on this Side call'd <hi>Bleachly,</hi> and on the other <hi>Auſt,</hi> as I have mention'd before. Here <hi>Offa's Dyke</hi> begins, and paſſing through <hi>Radnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:0141100402:320"/>
extends itſelf up to <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> and ſo to the River <hi>Dee,</hi> which parts <hi>Wales</hi> from <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We turn'd Northwards, and arrived at <hi>Aberga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venny,</hi> which is a large well-built and well-inhabited Market-town, ſituate at the Mouth of the <hi>Gavenny</hi> running into the <hi>Uſk.</hi> It carries on a conſiderable Trade in Flanels, which the Country People manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture at home, and bring hither to ſell. It is a great Thorough-fare from the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Bath</hi> by <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> and to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> by <hi>Monmouth</hi>; and ſo croſſing the River thro' <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and the Foreſt of <hi>Dean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fuel in this County is Pit-coal, and is very cheap, inſomuch that they ſell a Horſe-load for Two-pence, at the Pit-mouth; and 'tis common, in the meaneſt Cot to ſee a good Fire.</p>
            <p>Great Quantities of Corn are exported out of this County; and 'tis frequent, that the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſend their Ships hither to load for <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other foreign Countries. And indeed it is noted for producing as good Wheat and other Grain, as any County in the Kingdom; and yet it is very ſurpriſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Lands here never ſell for more than 20 or 21 Years Purchace. The current Language of the County is <hi>Welſh</hi> among the Vulgar, but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> generally.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought I ſhould not pay the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality the Reſpect it ſo well deſerves, if I did not begin a Letter with the Deſcription of it; it being the Country of that brave People, who had an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Right to the whole Iſland, and made ſo noble a Stand in Defence of their Liberties and Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; and at laſt, rather than ſubmit to a foreign Yoke, choſe to be free in this remote and inacceſſible Part of it.</p>
            <p>The two firſt Counties which border Weſt upon <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> are <hi>Brecknock</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and are very mountainous on the Eaſt Side, which gives a Traveller a terrible Apprehenſion of the Country he is this way entering into, and an Expectation of meeting with nothing that is agreeable; but he is not long before he is undeceived, and finds the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Trouble. In that Part of <hi>Monmouthſhire</hi> which joins the Two Counties, begins the riſing of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0141100402:322"/>
the Hills. <hi>Kyrton-Beacon, Tumberlow, Blorench, Penvail,</hi> and <hi>Skirridan,</hi> are ſome of the Names of theſe horrid Mountains, and are all in this Shire; and I could not but fanſy myſelf in View of <hi>Mount Brennus, Little-Barnard,</hi> and <hi>Great-Barnard,</hi> among the <hi>Alps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We now entered <hi>South Wales</hi>; which contains the Shires of <hi>Glamorgan, Brecknock, Radnor, Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brecknockſhire</hi> is a mere inland County, as <hi>Radnor</hi> is; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> jeſtingly (and I think not very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) call it <hi>Break-neck-ſhire:</hi> 'tis mountainous to an Extremity, except on the Side of <hi>Radnor,</hi> where it is ſomething more low and level. It is well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the <hi>Wye,</hi> and the <hi>Uſke,</hi> two Rivers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd before. Upon the latter ſtands the Town of <hi>Brecknock,</hi> the Capital of the County, well-built, and the Aſſizes are kept at it. It is very antient, and indeed, to mention it here once for all, there are more Tokens of Antiquity to be ſeen every-where in <hi>Wales,</hi> than in any particular Part of <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Here we ſaw <hi>Brecknock-mere,</hi> a large or long Lake of Water, Two or Three Miles over; of which they have a great many Fables, not worth relating: the beſt of them is, that a certain River, call'd the <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weni,</hi> runs thro' it, and keeps its Colour in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanel, diſtinguiſh'd from the Water of the Lake, and, as they ſay, never mingles with it. They take abundance of good Fiſh in this Lake, ſo that, like the River <hi>Theiſſe,</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> they ſay it is Two-thirds Water, and One-third Fiſh. The Country People affirm, that once a City ſtood here, but, that by the Judgment of Heaven, for the Sins of its Inhabitants, it ſunk into the Earth, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter roſe up in the Place of it. I obſerve the ſame Story is mention'd by Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> with ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Particulars: I believe my Share of it,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0141100402:323"/>
but 'tis remarkable, that Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> having loſt the old City <hi>Loventium,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to be hereabouts, is willing to account for it by this odd Story.</p>
            <p>It was among the Mountains of this County that the famous <hi>Glendower</hi> ſhelter'd himſelf, and taking Arms on the depoſing <hi>Richard</hi> II. proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; they ſhew us ſeveral little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges of his in the Mountains, whither he retreated; and from whence, again, he made ſuch bold Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into <hi>England,</hi> as to have put <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to very great Difficulties.</p>
            <p>Tho' this County be ſo mountainous, Proviſions are exceeding plentiful, and alſo very good all over the Country; nor are theſe Mountains uſeleſs, even to the City of <hi>London,</hi> as I have noted of other Counties; for from hence they ſend yearly great Herds of Black Cattle to <hi>England,</hi> and which are known to fill our Fairs and Markets, even that of <hi>Smithfield</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>The yellow Mountains of <hi>Radnorſhire</hi> are the ſame, and their Product of Cattle is the ſame; nor did I meet with any thing worth noticing, except Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Antiquity. The Stories of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> and <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> are in every old Woman's Mouth here. There is here a great Cataract or Water-fall of the River <hi>Wye,</hi> at a Place call'd <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jadr Gwy</hi> in <hi>Welſh,</hi> which ſignifies the Cataract or Water-fall of the <hi>Wye</hi>; but we did not go to ſee it, by reaſon there was a great Flood out at that time, which made the Way dangerous. There ſeemed to us a kind of Deſart too, on that Side, which is ſcarce paſſable by Strangers; ſo we made it our North Boundary for this Part of our Journey.</p>
            <p>We ſhall only add; That <hi>Radnor</hi> is the Shire Town, and hath a Caſtle; that <hi>Preſteigne</hi> in <hi>Radnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> is a well-built Town, and the Aſſizes are held there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:0141100402:324"/>Entering <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> from <hi>Radnor</hi> and <hi>Breck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> we beheld <hi>Monuchdenny-hill</hi> on our Left, and the <hi>Black Mountains</hi> on the Right, and all a Ridge of horrid Rocks and Precipices between, over which, if we had not had good Guides, we ſhould never have found our Way; and indeed, we began to repent our Curioſity, in going out of the common Road, as not having met with any thing worth the Trouble; and the Country looking ſo full of Horror, we thought to have given over the Enterprize, and have left <hi>Wales</hi> out of our Circuit: But after a Day and a Night engaging thus with Rocks and Mountains, our Guide brought us down into a moſt agreeable Vale, opening to the South, and a pleaſant River running through it, call'd the <hi>Taaffe</hi>; and following its Courſe, we came in the Evening to the antient City of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and Town of <hi>Caerdiff,</hi> ſtanding almoſt together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Landaff</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> is the Seat of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal See, and a City; but ſo ſmall, that it has not a Market; but <hi>Caerdiff,</hi> which is lower on the River, is the Port and Town of Trade; and has a very good Harbour opening into the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, about four Miles below the Town.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral is a neat Building, and very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; they boaſt that this Church was a Houſe of Religious Worſhip many Years before any other was founded in the Iſland, and that the Chriſtian Religion flouriſh'd in its primitive Purity, from the Year 186, till the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſy overſpread this Country; which being afterwards rooted out, they plac'd St. <hi>Dobricius,</hi> as the firſt Biſhop, in this Town of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff,</hi> then call'd <hi>Launt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n:</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi> had formerly the Title of Archbiſhop; the three firſt Biſhops were afterwards ſainted for their eminent Holineſs of Life, and the Miracles they are ſaid to have wrought. 'Tis obſervable the Cathedral was antiently but 20 Foot long, and 10 broad, and had neither Steeple nor Bells, nor had they any other
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0141100402:325"/>
Cathedral from the Year 386, to the Year 1107, when Biſhop <hi>Urban</hi> built the preſent Church, with ſome Houſes for the Clergy adjoining, in the Nature of a Cloiſter.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Church is antient, yet the Building is good, and the Choir neat, and pretty well kept.</p>
            <p>The South Part of <hi>Glamorganſhire</hi> is pleaſant, agreeable, and very populous, inſomuch that it is called <hi>The Garden of Wales.</hi> Its Soil is fertile and rich, and the low Grounds are ſo well cover'd with Graſs, and ſtock'd with Cattle, that they ſupply the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> with Butter in very great Quantities ſalted and barrel'd up, juſt as <hi>Suffolk</hi> does the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caerphyli-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> is one of the nobleſt Pieces of Ruins in the whole Iſland. It was larger than any Caſtle in <hi>England,</hi> that of <hi>Windſor</hi> excepted; and from what remains of it, was as beautiful in its Architecture, as it is remarkable in its Ruins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neath</hi> is a Port where the Coal-Trade is pretty conſiderable, tho' it ſtands up within Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Swanzy</hi> is alſo a Sea-port, and a very conſiderable Town for Trade, with a very good Harbour: Here is alſo a very great Trade for Coals, and Culm, which they export to all the Ports of <hi>Somerſet, Devon,</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and even to <hi>Ireland</hi>; ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be ſeen a hundred Sail of Ships at a time loading Coals here; which greatly enriches the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and particularly this Town; it ſtands on the River <hi>Twye,</hi> or <hi>Taw:</hi> 'Tis very remarkable, that moſt of the Rivers in this County chime upon the Letters <hi>T</hi> and <hi>Y,</hi> as <hi>Taaf, Tawy, Tuy, Towy, Tyevy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are lately Mineral Waters found out at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> which are reported to be of great Efficacy in Fluxes and Haemorrhages of all Sorts. Conſumptions, if not too far gone, Diabetes, Palſies, Rheumatiſms,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0141100402:326"/>
Dropſies, and other Diſtempers, are ſaid to fall before theſe Styptick and Reſtorative Waters. They may certainly have very good Effects in many difficult Caſes; but it is doing an Injury to the Reputation of any Medicine in the World, to make it a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> and good for every thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kynfig-Caſtle,</hi> is now the Seat and Eſtate of the Lord <hi>Manſel,</hi> who has here alſo a very noble Income from the Collieries; which formerly denominated Sir <hi>Edward Manſel,</hi> one of the richeſt Commoners in <hi>Wales.</hi> The Family was innobled by her late Majeſty Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Neighbourhood, near <hi>Margan Mynydd,</hi> we ſaw the famous Monument mention'd by Mr. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> on a Hill, with the Inſcription, which the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar are ſo terrify'd at, that nobody cares to read it; for they have a Tradition from Father to Son, that whoever ventures to read it, will die within a Month. We did not ſcruple the Adventure, but when we came to try, the Letters were ſo defac'd by Time, that we were effectually ſecur'd from the Danger; the Inſcription not being any thing near ſo legible, as it ſeems it was in Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>The Stone Pillar is about 4 or 5 Feet high, and one Foot thick, ſtanding on the Top of this Hill; there are ſeveral other ſuch Monuments in <hi>Radnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and other Counties in <hi>Wales,</hi> as likewiſe in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus touch'd on what is moſt curious on this Coaſt, we paſs'd thro' the Land of <hi>Gowre</hi>; and going ſtill <hi>Weſt,</hi> we came to <hi>Caermarthen,</hi> or <hi>Kaer-Vyrdhin,</hi> as the <hi>Welſh</hi> call it, the Capital of the County of <hi>Kaermardhinſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an antient and a very handſome Town, pleaſantly ſituated on the River <hi>Towy,</hi> which is navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable up to the Town, for Veſſels of a moderate Burden, and over which is a large Bridge. The Town is well-built, and populous; it is lately much
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0141100402:327"/>
increas'd, and is ſtill increaſing; and the County round it is the moſt fruitful of any Part of <hi>Wales,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be ſo thro' all the Middle of the County, and a great Way into the next; nor is this County ſo mountainous and wild, as the reſt of this Part of <hi>Wales:</hi> But it abounds in Corn, and in fine flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meadows, as good as moſt are in <hi>Britain,</hi> and in which are fed a very great Number of good Cattle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chancery,</hi> and <hi>Exchequer,</hi> for the South Part of the Principality, were uſually kept at this Town, till the Juriſdiction of the Court and Marches of <hi>Wales</hi> was taken away. This Town was alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the Birth of the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prophet, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> of whom ſo many things are fabled, and who flouriſh'd in the Year 480: And here alſo the old <hi>Britons</hi> often kept their Parliaments, or Aſſemblies of their wiſe Men, and made their Laws. The Town was fortify'd in former times, but the Walls are not to be ſeen now, and ſcarcely the Ruins of them. The People in this Town and Country are reckon'd the wealthieſt and politeſt in <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we ſaw near <hi>Kily-Maen Llwyd,</hi> on a great Mountain, a Circle of mighty Stones, very much like <hi>Stone-henge</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> or rather like the <hi>Roll-rich</hi> Stones in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi>; and tho' the People call it <hi>Bruarth Arthur,</hi> or King <hi>Arthur's Throne,</hi> we ſee no reaſon to believe, that it had any relation to him.</p>
            <p>The next County Weſt, is <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> the moſt extreme Part of <hi>Wales</hi> on this Side. It is a rich, fertile, and plentiful Country, lying on the Sea-coaſt, where it has the Benefit of <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> one of the greateſt and beſt Ports in <hi>Britain.</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays, it contains 16 Creeks, 5 great Bays, and 13 good Roads for Shipping, all diſtinguiſh'd as ſuch by their Names; and ſome ſay, a thouſand Sail of Ships may ride in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0141100402:328"/>Part of <hi>Pembrokeſhire</hi> is inhabited by the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the <hi>Flemings,</hi> placed there by King <hi>Henry</hi> I. and that County is called, <hi>Little England beyond Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we quitted the Coaſt, we ſaw <hi>Tenbigk,</hi> the moſt agreeable Town on all the Sea-coaſt of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> except <hi>Pembroke,</hi> being a very good Road for Shipping, and well frequented. Here is a great Fiſhery for Herring in its Seaſon, a great Colliery, or rather Export of Coals, and they alſo drive a very conſiderable Trade to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence, the Land, bearing far into the Sea, makes a Promontory, call'd St. <hi>Goven's-Head,</hi> or <hi>Point.</hi> But as we found nothing of Moment there, we croſs'd over the Iſthmus to <hi>Pembroke,</hi> which ſtands on the Eaſt Shore of the great Haven of <hi>Milford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the largeſt and richeſt, and at this Time the moſt flouriſhing Town of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> except <hi>Carmarthen.</hi> Here are a great many Gentlemen and Merchants, and ſome of the latter are Men of good Buſineſs; and they told us, there were near 200 Sail of Ships belong'd to the Town, ſmall and great; in a Word, all this Part of <hi>Wales</hi> is a rich and flouriſhing Country, very pleaſant, fertile, and well cultivated.</p>
            <p>This is the Place alſo made particularly famous for the Landing of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. then Earl of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence, being reſolv'd to ſee the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the County, Weſt, we ferry'd over the Haven, and went to <hi>Haverford,</hi> by ſome call'd <hi>Haverford-Weſt,</hi> a County in itſelf; and from thence to St. <hi>David</hi>'s. <hi>Haverford</hi> is a good Town, ſtrong, well-built, clean, and populous.</p>
            <p>From hence to St. <hi>David</hi>'s, the Country begins to look dry, barren, and mountainous.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>David</hi>'s is now a Biſhop's See only, but was formerly an Archbiſhop's, which was transferr'd to <hi>Dole</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> where it ſtill remains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0141100402:329"/>The venerable Aſpect of this Cathedral Church ſhews, that it has been a beautiful Building. The Weſt-end or Body of the Church is tolerable; the Choir is kept neat; the South Iſle without the Choir, and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s Chapel, which makes the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the Church, are in a manner demoliſh'd, and the Roofs of both fallen in.</p>
            <p>There have been a great many eminent Perſons bury'd here, beſides ſuch whoſe Monuments are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd by Time. Here is St. <hi>David</hi>'s Monument, to whom the Church is dedicated, the Monument of the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> as alſo of the famous <hi>Owen Tudor</hi>; Here are alſo four antient Monuments of Knights-Templars, known by their Figures lying croſs-legg'd; but their Names are not known, and there are ſix ſeveral Monuments of Biſhops, who preſided over this Church, beſides St. <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Saint, they tell us, was Uncle to King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> that he lived to 146 Years of Age, that he was Biſhop of this Church ſixty-five Years, being born in the Year 496, and died <hi>Anno</hi> 642; that he built twelve Monaſteries, and perform'd abundance of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>There was a very handſome Houſe for the Biſhop, with a College, all built in a Cloſe by themſelves; but they are now in Ruins.</p>
            <p>Here, the Weather being very clear, we had a full View of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though at a very great Diſtance. The Land here is call'd St. <hi>David's-Head.</hi> They reckon up 114 Biſhops of this See, ſince it began, to the Year 1740.</p>
            <p>A late Biſhop of this See was Dr. <hi>Thomas Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> of whom the World has heard ſo much, being depriv'd, after a long Debate, on a Charge of <hi>Simony.</hi> I ſhall not inquire into the Merits of the Caſe; but he beſtow'd great Sums on charitable Deſigns.</p>
            <p>From hence we turn'd North, keeping the Sea in our Weſt Proſpect, and a rugged mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0141100402:330"/>
on the Eaſt, where the Hills even darken'd the Air with their Height. As we went on, we paſt by <hi>Newport,</hi> on the River <hi>Nevern,</hi> a Town having a good Harbour, and conſequently a good Trade with <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we left <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> and after about 22 Miles came to <hi>Cardigan,</hi> a well-inhabited Town, on the River <hi>Tyvy,</hi> over which it has a fair Stone Bridge: 'Tis a very noble River indeed, and famous for its Plenty of the beſt and largeſt Salmon in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Country People told us, that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Beavers here, which bred in the Lakes among the Mountains, and coming down the Stream of <hi>Tyvy,</hi> deſtroy'd the young Frye of Salmon, and therefore the Country People deſtroy'd 'em. We thought they only meant the Otter, till I found afterwards, that Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> mentions alſo, that there had been Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſeen here formerly.</p>
            <p>This Town of <hi>Cardigan</hi> was once poſſeſs'd by the great <hi>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</hi> who was the firſt <hi>Briton</hi> that ever attempted the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and had ſuch Succeſs with a Handful of Men, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> a Footing there, which they never quitted afterwards, till they quite reduc'd the Country, and made it, as it were, a Province to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town is large and populous, has a fair Church, and is walled about, and fortified with a Caſtle, but that Part is now not much minded. It has a good Trade with <hi>Ireland,</hi> and is enrich'd very much, as is all this Part of the Country, by the famous Lead Mines, formerly diſcover'd by Sir <hi>Carbery Price,</hi> which are the greateſt, and perhaps the richeſt in <hi>England</hi>; and particularly as they require ſo little Labour and Charge to come at the Ore, which in many Places lies within a Fathom or two of the Surface, and in ſome, even bare to the very Top. There are alſo Silver Mines in this County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:0141100402:331"/>Going North from the <hi>Tyvy</hi> about 25 Miles, we came to <hi>Aberyſtwith,</hi> that is to ſay, the Town at the Mouth of the River <hi>Yſtwith.</hi> It is a populous, but a dark, ſmoaky Place; and we fanſy'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple look'd as if they had liv'd continually in Coal or Lead Mines. However, they are rich.</p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Cardigan</hi> is in no wiſe comparable to either of thoſe <hi>Welſh</hi> Counties which we have already paſs'd through, there being a great deal of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Lands in it. However, it is ſo full of Cattle, that 'tis ſaid to be the Nurſery, or Breeding-Place for the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> South by <hi>Trent</hi>; but this is not a Proof of its Fertility; for tho' the feeding of Cattle indeed requires a rich Soil, the breeding them does not, the Mountains and Moors being as proper for that Purpoſe as richer Land.</p>
            <p>Now we enter'd <hi>North-Wales</hi>; only I ſhould add, that as we paſs'd, we had a Sight of the famous <hi>Plymlymon-Hill,</hi> out of the Eaſt-ſide of which, riſe the <hi>Severn,</hi> and the <hi>Wye</hi>; and out of the Weſt-ſide of it, riſe the <hi>Rydall</hi> and the <hi>Yſtwyth.</hi> This Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is exceeding high, and though it is hard to ſay which is the higheſt Hill in <hi>Wales,</hi> yet I think this bids fair for it; nor is the County, for 20 Miles round it, any thing but a continued Ridge of Mountains: So that for a few Days we ſeem'd to be converſing in the upper Regions; for we were often above the Clouds a great way, and the Names of ſome of theſe Hills ſeem'd as barbarous to us, who ſpoke no <hi>Welſh,</hi> as the Hills themſelves.</p>
            <p>Paſſing theſe Mountains North, we enter'd North <hi>Wales,</hi> which contains the Counties of <hi>Montgomery, Merioneth, Caernarvon, Denbeigh,</hi> and <hi>Flint</hi> Shires, and the Iſle of <hi>Angleſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In paſſing <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> we were ſo tired with Hills and Mountains, that we wiſh'd heartily we had kept cloſe to the Sea Shore; but we had not much mended the matter, if we had, as I underſtood
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0141100402:332"/>
afterwards. The River <hi>Severn</hi> is the principal Beauty of this County, which riſing out of the <hi>Plymlymon</hi> Mountain, as I have ſaid, receives in a ſhort Courſe ſo many other Rivers into its Boſom, that it becomes navigable before it gets out of the County, at <hi>Welſh-Pool,</hi> on the Edge of <hi>Shropſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montgomery</hi> is a faſhionable Place, and has many fair Dwellings in it, and ſome very good Families.</p>
            <p>The Vales and Meadows upon the Banks of the <hi>Severn</hi> are exceedingly ornamental and profitable, and 'tis ſaid, that the Water of the <hi>Severn,</hi> like that of <hi>Nile,</hi> when it overflows, impregnates the Valleys by the Slime it leaves behind it; all the Country is very fruitful, where-ever this River runs. The Town of <hi>Montgomery</hi> lies not far from this River, on the outer Edge of the County, next to <hi>Herefordſhire.</hi> This was, it ſeems, a great Frontier Town in the Wars between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and was beautify'd and fortify'd by King <hi>Henry</hi> III. but it is not now ſo very conſiderable, though a good Town ſtill, pleaſantly ſituated, and has a Caſtle.</p>
            <p>This County has been long noted for an excellent Breed of <hi>Welſh</hi> Horſes, which, though not very large, are exceeding valuable, and much eſteem'd all over <hi>England.</hi> All the North and Weſt Part of the County is mountainous and ſtony. We ſaw a great many old Monuments in this Country, and <hi>Roman</hi> Camps, where-ever we came; and eſpecially, if we met any Perſons curious in ſuch things, we found they had many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> or <hi>Merionydſhire,</hi> lies Weſt from <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, or rather the Ocean; for St. <hi>George's Chanel</hi> does not begin till further North; and it is extended on the Coaſt, for near 35 Miles in Length, all ſtill mountainous and craggy. The principal River is the <hi>Tovy,</hi> which riſes among the unpaſſable Mountains, which range
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0141100402:333"/>
along the Centre of this Part of <hi>Wales,</hi> and which we look at with Aſtoniſhment, for their prodigious Height. Some of the Hills have particular Names, but otherwiſe we called them all, <hi>The Black Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and they well deſerve the Name. Some think 'tis from the unpaſſable Mountains of this County, that we have an old Saying, That the Devil lives in the <hi>Middle of Wales,</hi> tho' I know there is another Meaning given to it; in a word, Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls theſe Parts the <hi>Alps of Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are but few large Towns in all this Part, nor is it very populous; much of it being ſcarce habitable, but 'tis ſaid, there are more Sheep in it, than in all the reſt of <hi>Wales.</hi> On the Sea Shore however, we ſaw <hi>Harleigh,</hi> or <hi>Harlech-Caſtle,</hi> which is ſtill a Gariſon, and kept for the Guard of the Coaſt; but 'tis of no other Strength, than what its Situation gives it.</p>
            <p>In the middle of theſe vaſt Mountains (and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very large Lake, <hi>viz.</hi> near its firſt Sources) riſes the River <hi>Dee,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak again in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>Here, among almoſt innumerable Summits, and riſing Peaks of nameleſs Hills, we ſaw the famous <hi>Kader-Idricks,</hi> which, ſome are of Opinion, is the higheſt Mountain in <hi>Britain,</hi> another call'd <hi>Rarau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaur,</hi> another call'd <hi>Mowywynda</hi>; and ſtill every Hill we ſaw, we thought higher than all that ever we ſaw before.</p>
            <p>We inquired here after that ſtrange Phaenomenon, which was not only ſeen, but fatally experienc'd, by the Country round this Place, namely of a livid Fire, coming off from the Sea, and ſetting on Fire Houſes, Barns, Stacks of Hay and Corn, and poiſoning the Herbage in the Field; of which there is a full Account given in the Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions: And as we had it confirm'd by the general Voice of the People, I ſhall take notice, That the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0141100402:334"/>
Tranſactions particularly obſerve, that the Eclipſes of the Sun in <hi>Aries</hi> have been very fatal to this Place; and that the Years 1542, and 1567, when the Sun was eclipſed in that Sign, it ſuffer'd very much by Fire; and after the latter Eclipſe of the two, the Fire ſpread ſo far, that about 200 Houſes in the Town and Suburbs of <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd.</p>
            <p>This mountainous Country runs away North thro' <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> and almoſt thro' <hi>Caernarvonſhire,</hi> where <hi>Snowden-hill,</hi> of a monſtrous Height, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its Name, had Snow on the Top in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June</hi>; but it does not continue the Year round, as ſome have aſſerted.</p>
            <p>Theſe unpaſſable Heights were doubtleſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges of the <hi>Britons,</hi> when, in their continual Wars with the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd.</p>
            <p>That Side of the County of <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> which borders on the Sea, is not ſo mountainous, and is both more fertile, and more populous. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Place in this Part is <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> a good Town, with a Caſtle built by <hi>Edward</hi> I. to curb and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the wild People of the Mountains, and ſecure the Paſſage into <hi>Angleſea.</hi> That Prince alſo kept his Court often here; and here his eldeſt Son and Succeſſor, <hi>Edward</hi> II. was born, who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <hi>Edward of Caernarvon.</hi> This <hi>Edward</hi> was the firſt of the Sons of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> veſted with the Title of Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> And here were kept the <hi>Chancery</hi> and <hi>Exchequer</hi> of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> for the North Part of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, as it was at <hi>Caermarthen</hi> for the South Part. It is a ſmall, but ſtrong Town, clean, and well-built; and, conſidering the Place, the People are very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and obliging to Strangers. It is ſeated on the Firth or Inlet call'd <hi>Meneu,</hi> parting the Iſle of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> or <hi>Mona,</hi> from the main Land; and here

            <p>Whoever travels critically over theſe Mountains of <hi>South-Wales</hi> and <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> will think <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and <hi>Roll-rich</hi> Stones in <hi>Oxfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> no more Wonders, ſeeing there are ſo many ſuch in theſe Provinces, that they are not thought ſtrange of at all, nor is it doubted, but they were generally Monuments of the Dead; as alſo are the ſingle Stones of immenſe Bulk, of which we ſaw ſo many, that we gave over remarking 'em. Some meaſur'd from 7, 8, to 10, and one 16 Feet high, being a whole Stone, but ſo great, that the moſt of the Wonder is, where they were found, and how dragg'd to the Place; ſince, beſides the ſteep Aſcents to ſome of the Hills, on which they ſtand, it would be hardly poſſible to move ſome of them, now, with 50 Yoke of Oxen. And yet a great many of theſe Stones are found confuſedly lying one upon another on the utmoſt Summit or Top of the <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and other Hills in <hi>Merioneth,</hi> or <hi>Caernarvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; to which it is next to impoſſible, that all the Power of Art, and Strength of Man and Beaſt, could carry them, and the Vulgar make no Difficulty of ſaying, The Devil ſet them up there.</p>
            <p>One of theſe monumental Stones is to be ſeen a little way from <hi>Harleigh-Caſtle:</hi> It is a large Stone lying flat, ſupported by three other Stones at three of the four Angles, tho' the Stone is rather oval than ſquare; it is almoſt 11 Feet long, the Breadth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; but in ſome Places it is from 7 to 8 Feet broad, and it may be ſuppoſed has been both longer and broader; 'tis in ſome Places about two Feet thick, but in others, 'tis worn almoſt to an Edge by Time. The three Stones that ſupport it, are about
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0141100402:340"/>
20 Inches ſquare; 'tis ſuppoſed there have been four, two of which, that ſupport the thickeſt End, are near 8 Feet high, the other not above three Feet, being ſuppos'd to be ſettled in the Ground, ſo that the Stone lies ſloping, like the Roof of a Barn. There is another of theſe to be ſeen in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſea</hi>; the flat Stone is much larger and thicker than this; but we did not go to ſee it. There are alſo two Circles of Stones in that Iſland, ſuch as <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> but larger.</p>
            <p>This is a particular kind of Monument, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I took Notice of it; but the others are generally ſingle Stones of vaſt Magnitude, ſet up on one End, Column-wiſe, which being ſo very large, are likely to remain till the End of Time: but are generally without any Inſcription, or regular Shape, or any Mark, to intimate for whom, or for what, they were ſo placed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mountains are indeed ſo like the <hi>Alps,</hi> that except the Language of the People, one could hardly avoid thinking he is paſſing from <hi>Grenoble</hi> to <hi>Suſa,</hi> or rather thro' the Country of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> The Lakes alſo, which are ſo numerous here, make the Similitude the greater: nor are the Fables which the Country People tell of theſe Lakes, much unlike the Stories which we meet with among the <hi>Switz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> of the famous Lakes in their Country. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s Continuator tells us of 50 or 60 Lakes in <hi>Caernarvonſhire</hi> only. We did not count 'em, but I believe, if we had, we ſhould have found them to be more, rather than leſs.</p>
            <p>Here we met with the Char Fiſh, the ſame kind which we ſaw in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and alſo in the Lakes of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and no-where elſe, that I have heard of, in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Welſh</hi> call it the <hi>Torg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>There is nothing of Note to be ſeen in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> but the Town and the Caſtle of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maris,</hi> which was alſo built by King <hi>Edward</hi> I.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0141100402:341"/>
and call'd <hi>Beau-marſh,</hi> or the <hi>Fine Plain</hi>; for here the Country is very level and plain, and the Land is fruitful and pleaſant. The Caſtle was very large, as may be ſeen by its Remains; and that it was ſtrong, the Situation will tell alſo; but 'tis now of no Uſe.</p>
            <p>As we went to <hi>Holyhead,</hi> by the South Part of the Iſland from <hi>Newborough,</hi> and came back thro' the Middle to <hi>Beaumaris,</hi> we ſaw the whole Extent of it; and indeed, it is a much pleaſanter Country than any Part of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> that we had yet ſeen; and particularly is very fruitful in Corn and Cattle.</p>
            <p>Here we croſs'd the <hi>Streight</hi> of <hi>Meneu</hi> again, and came to <hi>Bangor,</hi> at the Place where King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> I. intended to have built a great Stone-bridge: It would indeed have been a Work fit for ſo great a King: But the Bottom being doubtful, and the Sea in that Place ſometimes very raging and ſtrong, the Workmen thought it impracticable; and though the King was very poſitive in his Deſign for a great while, yet he was prevail'd with at laſt to decline it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bangor</hi> is a Town noted for its Antiquity. It is a Biſhop's See, but has an old, mean-looking, and almoſt deſpicable Cathedral Church.</p>
            <p>This Church boaſts of being one of the moſt antient in <hi>Britain,</hi> the People ſay, the moſt antient; and that St. <hi>Daniel</hi> (to whom it was dedicated) was firſt Biſhop here, in the Year 512. They allow that the Pagans, perhaps of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> ruin'd the Church, and poſſeſs'd the Biſhoprick after it was built, for above one hundred Years; nor is there any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it from the Year 512 to 1009: After this, the Biſhoprick was ruin'd again by one of its own Biſhops, whoſe Name was <hi>Bulkeley,</hi> who, as the <hi>Monaſticon</hi> ſays, not only ſold the Revenues, but even the very Bells; for which Sacrilege it is ſaid he was ſtruck blind.</p>
            <p>It is certainly at preſent no rich Biſhoprick; yet the Biſhops are generally allow'd to hold ſome other
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0141100402:342"/>
good Benefice <hi>in Commendam,</hi> and the Preferment ſeems to be a grateful Introduction to the Clergy, as the Biſhops are generally tranſlated from hence to a more profitable one; and very few Gentlemen of the Function have dy'd Biſhops of <hi>Bangor</hi>; ſo that, in ſome Senſe, a Biſhop of this See may be ſaid to be immortal.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Bangor</hi> we went North, (keeping the Sea on our Left-hand) to <hi>Conway.</hi> This is the pooreſt, but pleaſanteſt Town in all this County for the Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; it is ſeated on the Bank of a fine River, which is not only pleaſant and beautiful, but is a noble Harbour for Ships, had they any Occaſion for them there; the Stream is deep and ſafe, and the River broad, as the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Deptford:</hi> It only wants a Trade ſuitable to ſo good a Port; for it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely outdoes <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Liverpool</hi> too.</p>
            <p>In this Paſſage, we went over the famous Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice call'd <hi>Penmaen-maur,</hi> which I think Fame has made abundance more frightful than it is; for tho' the Rock is indeed very high, and, if any one ſhould fall from it, he would be daſh'd in Pieces, yet, on the other hand, there is no Danger of it, a Wall being built all the Way, on the Edge of the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, to ſecure Paſſengers: Thoſe who have been at the Hill or Paſs of <hi>Enterkin</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> know very well, the Danger there is much greater than here; and the frequent Loſs of Lives, both of Man and Horſe, will teſtify the ſame.</p>
            <p>We have but little remarkable in the Road from <hi>Conway</hi> to <hi>Holywell,</hi> but Craggs and Rocks all along the North Shore of <hi>Denbeigh,</hi> till we came to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beigh</hi> the County Town, which has a Caſtle of great Strength; it is a large, populous Place, and has a good Trade carry'd on by Tanners and Glovers. This Town carries ſomething in its Countenance of its Neighbourhood to <hi>England</hi>; but that which was moſt ſurpriſing, after ſuch a tireſome and fatiguing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0141100402:343"/>
Journey, over the inhoſpitable Mountains of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioneth</hi> and <hi>Caernarvonſhire,</hi> was, that deſcending now from the Hills, we came into a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, fruitful, populous, and delicious Vale, full o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Villages and Towns, the Fields ſhining with Corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſt ready for the Reapers, the Meadows green and flowery, and a fine River, of a mild and gentle Stream, running thro' it: Nor is it a ſmall or caſua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Intermiſſion, but we had a Proſpect of the Country open before us for above 20 Miles in Length, and from 5 to 7 Miles in Breadth, all ſmiling with the ſame kind of Complexion; which made us think our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>England</hi> again, all on a ſudden.</p>
            <p>In this pleaſant Vale, turning North from <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beigh,</hi> and following the Stream of the River, we came to <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> a ſmall City, with a Cathedral, being a Biſhoprick of tolerable good Value, though the Church is old: It is but a poor Place, and ill-built, although the Country is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and rich all round it. There are ſome old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents in this Church, but none of any Note, nor could we read the <hi>Welſh</hi> Inſcriptions.</p>
            <p>From hence we came to <hi>Holywell:</hi> The Story of it is, that the pious Virgin, St. <hi>Winifred,</hi> being raviſh'd and murder'd, this healing Water ſprung out of her Body when buried. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, as 'tis evident, from their thronging hither to receive Benefit from the healing Virtue of the Water, which they do not hope for as medicinal, but as miraculous, and think it heals them by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Interceſſion and Influence of this famous Virgin, St. <hi>Winifrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chapel dedicated to this Holy Virgin, is cut out of a ſolid Rock, and Numbers of Pilgrims re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to it, with great Devotion. Under this Chapel, the Water guſhes out into a great Stream, and the Place where it breaks out, is form'd like a Baſin or Ciſtern, in which they bathe: The Water is intenſly
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0141100402:344"/>
cold, and indeed there is no great Miracle in that Point, conſidering the Rocks it flows from, where it is impregnated by divers Minerals; the Virtue of which, and not of the Saint, I ſuppoſe, work the greateſt Part of the Cures, that may be ſuppos'd to be effected there.</p>
            <p>There is a little Town near the Well, which may, indeed, be ſaid to have riſen from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of People thither; for almoſt all the Houſes are either Publick Houſes, or let into Lodgings; and the Prieſts who attend here, and are very numerous, appear in Diſguiſe: Sometimes they are Phyſicians, ſometimes Surgeons, ſometimes Gentlemen, and ſometimes Patients, or any thing, as Occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. Nobody takes notice of them, as to their Religion, though they are well known, no not the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> themſelves; but in private they have their proper Oratories in certain Places, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Votaries reſort; and good Manners has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd ſo far, that no Proteſtant, let him know what he will, takes Notice of it, or inquires where one goes, or has been gone.</p>
            <p>The principal Towns in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> are, 1. <hi>Flint,</hi> the Shire Town, but ſo ſmall, that it has not a Market. 2. <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> before-mention'd. 3. <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wys,</hi> the chief Market-Town of the County.</p>
            <p>From hence we paſs'd by <hi>Flint-Caſtle,</hi> a known Place, but of no Conſequence now; and directly to <hi>Wrexham,</hi> deemed the largeſt Town in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> having heard much of a fine Church there, but we were greatly diſappointed: There is indeed a very large Tower or Steeple, as ſome call it, adorn'd with Imagery; but far from fine: The Work is mean, the Statues without any Fancy or Spirit; and as the Stone is of a reddiſh crumbling Kind, like the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> Time has made it look groſs and rough.</p>
            <p>There are a great many antient Monuments in this Church, and in the Church-yard alſo; but none of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0141100402:345"/>
Note, and almoſt all the Inſcriptions are in <hi>Welſh.</hi> The Church is large; but they muſt be much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, who tell us 'tis one of the fineſt in <hi>England</hi>; for it falls ſhort in that reſpect, of even thoſe Churches which are as old as itſelf.</p>
            <p>This Town is large, well-built and populous; and beſides the Church, there are two large Meeting-Houſes, in one of which, we were told they preach in <hi>Welſh</hi> one Part of the Day, and in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the other. Here is a great Market for Flannel, which the Factors buy up of the poor <hi>Welſh</hi> People, who manufacture it; and thence it is ſent to <hi>London</hi>; and is a conſiderable Manufacture thro' all this Part of the Country, by which the Poor are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably imploy'd.</p>
            <p>We could not omit ſeeing the once famous <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> which <hi>Malmsbury</hi> confounds with the Epiſcopal <hi>Bangor</hi>; and were pleas'd to ſee there a fine Stone Bridge over the <hi>Dee.</hi> This was once a City, and the Monaſtery was ſo famous, that in the Time of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings it was ſaid to contain 2400 Monks, who in their Turns (<hi>viz.</hi> 100 each Hour of the 24) reading Prayers and ſinging Pſalms continually, Divine Service was perform'd Day and Night without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. But now not ſo much as the Ruins are to be ſeen, and as all the People in the little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, that takes place of it, ſpoke <hi>Welſh,</hi> we could find no body that could give us any Intelligence. So effectually had Time eras'd the very Foundations of the Place.</p>
            <p>This is ſaid to be the Birth-place of that Arch-here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who from hence began to broach his heretical Opinions, which afterwards ſo terribly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Church. <hi>Camden</hi> obſerves, that this <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> is ſituated in the County of <hi>Flint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I have intirely done with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, give me leave to obſerve briefly a few things with relation to this Journey, and the Gentlemen of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:0141100402:346"/>Tho' this Journey, and eſpecially over ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Hills and Precipices, as thoſe in <hi>Merioneth</hi> and ſome other Shires, was a little heavy to us, yet were we well ſupported through it, for we generally found their Proviſions very good and cheap, and pretty good Accommodations in the Inns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Welſh</hi> Gentlemen are very hoſpitable; and the People in general very obliging and converſable, eſpecially to Strangers. When we let them know, we travell'd merely in Curioſity to view the Country, their Civility was heightened to ſuch a Degree, that nothing could be more friendly, and they were will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tell us every thing that belong'd to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to ſhew us all that we deſir'd to ſee.</p>
            <p>They value themſelves much upon their antient Heroes, as <hi>Caractacus, Owen ap Tudor,</hi> Prince <hi>Lewellin</hi>; and particularly upon the Antiquity of their Families, and laugh at a Pedigree, that can't be trac'd higher than the Conqueſt. It muſt be own'd, that the Gentlemen, juſtly claim a very antient Deſcent, and have preſerv'd their Families intire, for many Ages: They receive you well into their Houſes, treat you very handſomely, are very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and indeed, nothing is wanting within Doors; and, what is more, they have generally very good Eſtates to ſupport their Hoſpitality; but they are very jealous of Affronts, and ſoon provok'd to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which is ſeldom allay'd without Satisfaction; and then become as ſoon reconcil'd again.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Continued at <hi>Cheſter</hi> for ſome time, except that I made two or three Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into the neighbouring Country, and particularly into that Part of <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> which I had not view'd as I went; as alſo into the North, and North-weſt Parts of <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> But I ſhould firſt acquaint you, that <hi>Malpas,</hi> through which I came from <hi>Wales,</hi> is ſituate on a high Hill, and was formerly ſtrengthened by a Caſtle, which is now in Ruins. The Church is a ſtately Building, and ſtands on the moſt eminent Part of the Town: It has 2 Rectors, who do Duty alternately. The Town conſiſts of 3 Streets, and is well pav'd; has a good Market, a Grammar-School, and an Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>The firſt Trip I made, was into the <hi>Ceſtria Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneſus,</hi> as I think we may properly call it: It is bounded by the two great Firths, or Arms of the Sea,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0141100402:348"/>
the one call'd the Mouth of the <hi>Dee,</hi> and the other of the two Rivers <hi>Merſey</hi> and <hi>Weaver,</hi> which form it into a Peninſula. It is about 16 Miles long, 6 or 7 over, and has not one Market Town in it, tho' it is exceeding rich and fertile; occaſion'd poſſibly by the Neighbourhood of two ſuch great Towns, as <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Liverpool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Going down from <hi>Cheſter,</hi> by the <hi>Rhoodee,</hi> as they call it, that is, the Marſhes of the River <hi>Dee,</hi> and coaſting the River after it is grown broader than the Marſhes, the firſt Place of any Note which we come to, is <hi>Neſſon,</hi> where, in the late <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, moſt of the Troops embark'd for that grand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: From hence the Veſſels go away to <hi>High-lake,</hi> where they ride ſafe in their Way, as the Ships from <hi>London</hi> lie in the <hi>Downs,</hi> till the Wind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for their reſpective Voyages.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Cheſter.</hi> It is a fine old City and Colony of the <hi>Romans</hi>; and many Antiquities have been found in it. It has four Churches beſide the Cathedral, which is a Pile venerable for Antiquity, but in no extraordinary Condition. There are Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of many Pictures on the Wall, but defac'd. At the Weſt End, in Niches are ſome Images of the Earls Palatine of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The adjoining Abbey is quite ruin'd. The Walls round the City are kept in very good Repair, at the Charge of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and afford a pleaſant, airy Walk. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is a neat Building, ſupported by Columns 13 Feet high, of one Stone each. Over it is the City-hall, a well-contrived Court of Judicature. The Caſtle was formerly the Palace, where the Earls aſſembled their Parliaments, and enacted Laws inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> determining all Cauſes themſelves. It has always a Garriſon kept in it. The Piazza's or Rows, as they call them, do not in my Opinion, add any thing to the Beauty of the City; but, on the contrary, ſerve to make it look
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0141100402:349"/>
both old and indifferent. Theſe <hi>Rows</hi> are certain long Galleries, up one Pair of Stairs, which run along the Side of the Streets, before all the Houſes, tho' joined to them, and, as is pretended, they are to keep the People dry in walking along. This they do indeed effectually, but then they take away all the View of the Houſes from the Street, nor can a Stranger, that was to ride thro' <hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſee any Shops in the City; beſides, they make the Shops themſelves dark, and the Way in them is dark, dirty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even.</p>
            <p>The beſt Ornament of the City is, that the Streets are very broad and fair, and run thro' the whole City in ſtrait Lines, croſſing in the middle of it as at <hi>Chicheſter:</hi> The Walls afford a very pleaſant Walk, as I have ſaid, round the City, and within the Battlements, from whence you may ſee the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent Country, and particularly on the Side of the <hi>Rhoodee,</hi> which is a fine large low Green, on the Bank of the <hi>Dee,</hi> which in Winter is often under Water by the Inundations of the River. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Rhoodee,</hi> may be ſeen from the Walls of <hi>Cheſter</hi> the County of <hi>Flint,</hi> and the Mountains of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſtle is a good firm Building, and ſtrong, tho' not fortify'd with many Outworks: There is always a good Garriſon kept in it. 'Tis ſaid this Caſtle was built, or at leaſt repair'd, by <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> the famous Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> Nephew to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, as was alſo the Church; the Body of whom was lately (<hi>Anno</hi> 1723) diſcover'd, as is ſuppoſed, in an old ruinous Building called, The Chapter-houſe.</p>
            <p>It was firſt wrapp'd in Leather, and then inclos'd in a Stone Coffin. The Skull and all the Bones were very freſh, and in their proper Poſition; and, what is more remarkable, the String which ty'd the Ankles together, was whole and intire, altho' it was then upwards of 650 Years ſince the Interrment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0141100402:350"/>
               <hi>Cheſter</hi> is but a modern Biſhoprick, being ſo made in the Year 1541. when King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it from <hi>Lichfield.</hi> They tell us, that King <hi>Edgar,</hi> who conquer'd all this Part of <hi>Britain,</hi> and was rowed up the <hi>Dee</hi> in his Royal Barge by Seven, or, as ſome ſay, Eight Kings, himſelf ſteering the Helm, founded the great Church, which <hi>Lupus</hi> finiſh'd and endow'd.</p>
            <p>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the <hi>Dee,</hi> very high and ſtrong built, and 'tis needful it ſhould be ſo; for the <hi>Dee</hi> is a moſt furious Stream at ſome Seaſons, and brings a vaſt Weight of Water with it from the Mountains of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheſter</hi> has long given Title of Earl to the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> eldeſt Son of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheſter</hi> was formerly an Harbour for Shipping; but the Sea had long ago withdrawn itſelf; and the River <hi>Dee</hi> was ſo choaked up, that Veſſels of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den could not come within ſome Miles of it; ſo that an Act of Parliament paſſed in the Year 1732, for rendering it navigable. And in Purſuance thereof, the Undertakers, raiſed a Sum of 47,830<hi>l.</hi> which they have expended in cutting and perfecting a new Chanel for the River <hi>Dee,</hi> of near Ten Miles in Length, and in making proper Dams and Sluices, into which they have turned the ſaid River; ſo that it is actually navigable at this Time for Ships and Veſſels of conſiderable Burdens to the Quay, or Key, of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where they load and unload Goods and Merchandize. This Succeſs encourag'd the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers to apply to Parliament (1740-1), for further Powers to complete the ſame, and for uniting the ſaid Undertakers into a Company for that laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This County, though ſo remote from <hi>London,</hi> is one of thoſe which contributes much to its Support, as well as to that of ſeveral other Parts of <hi>England,</hi> by its excellent Cheeſe, which they make here in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0141100402:351"/>
ſuch Quantities, that, as I am told from very good Authority, the City of <hi>London</hi> only takes off 14000 Tons every Year; beſides vaſt Quantities which they ſend to <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; ſo that the Quantity of Cheeſe made here, muſt be prodigiouſly great. Indeed, the whole County is imploy'd in it, and Part of its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood too; for though it goes by the Name of <hi>Cheſhire Cheeſe,</hi> yet great Quantities of it are made in ſuch Parts of <hi>Shropſhire, Staffordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> as border upon <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soil is extraordinarily good, and the Graſs has a peculiar Richneſs in it, which diſpoſes the Kine to give a great Quantity of Milk, which is very ſweet and good; and this Cheeſe Manufacture increaſes every Day, raiſes the Value of the Lands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the Farmers to keep vaſt Stocks of Cows; which of themſelves contribute to improve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Land.</p>
            <p>While we were ſtation'd, as I may ſay, at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> I made a Trip to ſeveral Places round about it. And particularly to the fine old Seat of the Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere,</hi> and the ſpacious Foreſt which gives Title to that noble Family. They ſay here was formerly an old City, now called the <hi>Chamber on the Foreſt,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſome Fort or Camp to ſecure the Road. From hence is ſo fine a Proſpect of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Mountains, that I never before beheld ſuch a noble Scene of Nature. <hi>Beeſton-Caſtle</hi> is on our left, built upon a Precipice. This Foreſt is noted for great Plenty of Red and Fallow Deer, and is a great Relief for Fiſh, Fowl, and Turf, to the neighbouring Towns, whereof there are a great many ſmall ones about this Foreſt, and thro' the upper Part of it the <hi>Weaver</hi> takes its Courſe. The chief Town hereabout is <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>deſham,</hi> famous formerly for a Caſtle, and the Seat of the Family of the <hi>Savages,</hi> which however is but a mean Market-town. Near this Place is alſo
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0141100402:352"/>
the famous Seat of <hi>Rock-Savage,</hi> built on the Aſcent of an Hill belonging to the ſame Family, whereof the laſt was the late Earl <hi>Rivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the South Side of the Park ſtands <hi>Beeſton</hi>-Caſtle, upon an Hill environ'd with Mountains, and yet overlooks almoſt the whole County. It is very ſtrong, covers a great Extent of Ground, and is adorn'd with many Towers. It gives Name to an antient Family in this County.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cheſter</hi> we kept directly on Eaſt to <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> a large Market-town, with a ſpacious Church, but chiefly noted for making Salt; where are Two excellent Brine-ſeeths.</p>
            <p>We followed the <hi>Weaver</hi> directly North to <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> alſo famous for Brine-ſprings, and for making great Quantities of the fineſt Salt by boiling the Water in large iron Pans of ſmall Depth. As faſt as the Salt cryſtallizes, they rake it out, and dry it in wicker Baſkets of a conick Form. The Duty it brings in is very conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Within theſe Fifty Years, on the South-ſide of the Town, they diſcover'd a great many Mines of Rock-ſalt, which they continually dig up, and ſend in great Lumps to the maritime Ports, where it is diſſolv'd, and made into eating Salt. We were let down by a Bucket 150 Feet deep to the Bottom of the Salt Quarry, a moſt pleaſant ſubterraneous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, looking like a Cathedral ſupported by Rows of Pillars, and Roof of Cryſtal, all of the ſame Rock, tranſparent and glittering from the numerous Candles of the Workmen, labouring with their Steel Pick-axes in digging it away. This Rock-work extends to ſeveral Acres.</p>
            <p>There is a good Church at <hi>Northwich,</hi> with a fine Roof, and ſemicircular Choir.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Lawton-yates</hi> they bore 60 Yards deep for the Salt Spring; at <hi>Haſſal</hi> 47; at <hi>Wheelock</hi> 18; about <hi>Middlewich</hi> leſs; at <hi>Northwich</hi> it riſes to open Day;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0141100402:353"/>
which ſeems to intimate, that the ſalt Spring runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Layers of the Earth in an horizontal Line. Upon Boring, it riſes with great Impetuoſity, ſo that the Workmen have ſcarce Time to get out of the Wells. This is all along the Side of a Brook that comes from a remarkable Hill called <hi>Mawcop,</hi> upon the Edge of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi>; ſo that the Ground riſes above the true Level in the mentioned Proportion.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Northwich</hi> we travell'd North-eaſt, and came to <hi>Knutsford,</hi> a good Town, and finely ſituated. A Brook runs thro' it, and divides it into two. It has a Market and Town-houſe, and a pretty good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Altringham</hi> and <hi>Stockport,</hi> Two ſmall Market-towns, lie higher up Northward, the firſt near, and the other upon the Borders of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing remarkable in them, we turned South-eaſt from <hi>Knutsford</hi> to <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> which they call in this County <hi>Maxfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Macclesfield</hi> is ſituate in the Foreſt of the ſame Name, a Town of great Antiquity, and very fair and ſpacious. 'Tis under the Government of a Mayor, and enjoys many particular Privileges by virtue of the Court and Liberties of the Foreſt. It has a good Church with a high Spire Steeple, and a College adjoining to it, in which are buried a great many of the <hi>Savages:</hi> and here is alſo a good Free-ſchool, and a thriving Manufacture of Buttons.</p>
            <p>From hence we veer'd about, and came South-weſt to <hi>Congleton,</hi> near the Borders of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> a fair Mayor-town and well-water'd on all Sides. It has Two Churches, and is noted for a good Trade in Gloves.</p>
            <p>We then came to the Market-town of <hi>Sandbach,</hi> which is delightfully ſituated on a Branch of the <hi>Weaver.</hi> It has a fair Church, and in the Market-place ſtand Two Croſſes of Stone, with the Hiſtory
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0141100402:354"/>
of Chriſt's Paſſion ingraven on them. The Ale here is deſervedly famed.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Sandbach</hi> we went on Southward, and came to the great <hi>London</hi> Road at <hi>Namptwich,</hi> which ſtands upon it. This Town is well-built, and the Streets look fair, having a great many Gentlemens Houſes in them. The Church is a noble Edifice in the Form of a Croſs, with the Steeple riſing from the Middle; but the Maintenance of the Miniſter is mean and pitiful. The Inhabitants are rich, and carry on a good Trade in moſt ſort of Commodities, but principally in making Salt and Cheeſe, the latter exceeding all that is made in the County, as the Soil this Way is eſteemed the beſt, and, as 'tis ſaid, was called by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. the <hi>Vale Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having made my Circuit round the County, I ſhall go from hence South to <hi>Whitchurch</hi> in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> But I muſt firſt note two things of <hi>Cheſhire:</hi> 1. That there is no Part of <hi>England,</hi> where there are equal Numbers of Gentry, of ſuch antient and noble Extraction: Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> is very particular in their Names and Deſcents, to whom therefore I muſt refer. 2. That it is a County <hi>Palatine,</hi> and has been ſo for many Ages, and its Government is diſtinct from any other, and very particular; it is adminiſtred by a <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> a <hi>Judge Special,</hi> who is call'd <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> two <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> three <hi>Sergeants at Law,</hi> a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,</hi> an <hi>Eſcheator,</hi> and all proper and uſual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Officers; and the Juriſdiction of all theſe Offices is kept up, and preſerv'd very ſtrictly; only we are to note, that the <hi>Judge Special,</hi> as he is call'd, tries only civil Cauſes, not criminal, which are left to the ordinary Judges of <hi>England,</hi> who go the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits here, as in other Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whitchurch</hi> is a pleaſant, large, and populous Town, and has a very good Church, in which is the famous Monument of the great <hi>Talbot,</hi> firſt E. of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0141100402:355"/>
who was call'd in his Time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ACHILLES, and who was ſo renown'd in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> that no Man in that Kingdom dared to encounter him ſingle-handed. He had ingraven on one Side of his Sword, <hi>Sum Talboti,</hi> and on the Reverſe, <hi>Pro vincere inimicos meos.</hi> His Epitaph is as follows, in capital Letters:
<q>ORATE PRO ANIMA PRAENOBILIS DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINI, DOMINI IOHANNIS TALBOTT, QUONDAM COMITIS SALOPIAE, DOMINI TALBOTT, DOMINI FURNIVALL, DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINI VERDON, DOMINI STRANGE DE BLACKMERE, ET MARESCHALLI FRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIAE, QUI OBIIT IN BELLO APVD BVR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEWS VII. IVLII MCCCCLIII.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Town has a good Market, and a great many Gentry near it, whereof ſome are <hi>Roman-catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi> They tell us, that this Town, when King <hi>Charles</hi> I. remov'd his Standard from <hi>Nottingham</hi> to <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> raiſed a whole Regiment for his Service.</p>
            <p>From hence we turn'd South, and paſſing by <hi>Wem,</hi> the Title given by King <hi>James</hi> II. to his Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Jefferies,</hi> thence we came to <hi>Elſmere,</hi> which gives Title of Baron to the Duke of <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> and is famous for a great Lake or Mere, which gives the Town its Name, and which the People pretend has in ſome Places no Bottom. This Place is remarkable for good Fiſh.</p>
            <p>And further on Weſt, on the Confines of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bighſhire,</hi> ſtands <hi>Oſweſtry,</hi> a Bailiwick Market-town, famous formerly for the Sale of <hi>Welſh</hi> Cottons and Flanels, but now only for the laſt. It is incloſed with a Wall, and a Ditch, and fortified with a Caſtle, and has a good Church without the Gate covered with
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0141100402:356"/>
Lead. From hence we came the ſame Night to <hi>Shrewſbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> is ſuppoſed to have been built out of the Ruins of the antient <hi>Uriconium.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, <hi>Roger</hi> Earl of <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> built a Caſtle here, on the North Side, and a ſtately Abbey, ſome Ruins of which are ſtill to be ſeen. It is a beautiful, large, pleaſant, populous, and rich Town; full of Gentry, and yet full of Trade too; for here likewiſe is a great Manufacture, as well of Flanel, as alſo of white Broad-cloth, which inriches all the Country round it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Severn</hi> in part ſurrounds this Town, juſt as the <hi>Thames</hi> does the <hi>Iſle of Dogs</hi>; ſo that it makes the Form of an Horſe-ſhoe. Over it are two fine Stone Bridges, upon one of which is built a very noble Gate, and, over the Arch of the Gate, the Statue of the great <hi>Llewellin,</hi> the Idol of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and their laſt Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is really a Town of Mirth and Gallantry, ſomething like <hi>Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> or <hi>Durham</hi> in the North, but much bigger than either of them, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than both together.</p>
            <p>Over the Market-houſe is kept a kind of Hall for the Manufactures, which are ſold here weekly in very great Quantities; they ſpeak all <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Town, but on a Market-day you would think you were in <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the greateſt Market, the greateſt Plenty of good Proviſions, and the cheapeſt that is to be met with in all the Weſtern Part of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Severn</hi> ſupplies them here with excellent Salmon, but 'tis alſo brought in great Plenty from the <hi>Dee,</hi> which is not far off, and abounds with a very good Kind, and is generally larger than in the <hi>Severn.</hi> As an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Cheapneſs of Proviſions, we paid here, in a publick Inn, but a Groat a Night for Hay, and Sixpence a Peck for Oats, for our Horſes, which is
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0141100402:357"/>
cheaper than we found it in the cheapeſt Part of the North of <hi>England</hi>; all our other Proviſions were in Proportion; and there is no doubt but the Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Proviſions, joined to the Pleaſantneſs and Healthineſs of the Place, draws a great many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies hither, who love to live within the Compaſs of their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> calls it a City: and 'tis indeed equal to ſeveral good Cities in <hi>England,</hi> and ſuperior to ſome. Near this Place was fought the bloody Battle between <hi>Henry Hotſpur,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> IV. King of <hi>England,</hi> in which the former was kill'd, and all his Army overthrown, and the Place is called <hi>Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> to this Day.</p>
            <p>Here are Five Churches, Two of them with lofty Spires. St. <hi>Chad</hi>'s, and St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, are ſaid to be antiently collegiate. There are abundance of antient Monuments in them all, which I have not room to mention.</p>
            <p>This Town will for ever be famous for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception it gave to King <hi>Charles</hi> I. who, after ſetting up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and finding no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement there, remov'd to <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Gentry of the Town and Country round, where he was receiv'd with ſuch a general Affection, and hearty Zeal, that his Majeſty recover'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Diſcouragement of his firſt Step at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and raiſed and compleated a ſtrong Army in leſs Time than could be imagin'd; inſomuch that, to the Surprize of the Parliament, and indeed of all the World, he was in the Field before them, and advanced upon them ſo faſt, that he met them Two-thirds onward of his Way to <hi>London,</hi> and gave them Battle at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> near <hi>Banbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Fate of the War turning afterwards againſt the King, the Weight of it fell heavy upon this Town, and almoſt ruin'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0141100402:358"/>But they are now fully recover'd, and it is one of the moſt flouriſhing Towns in <hi>England.</hi> The Walls and Gates are yet ſtanding, but uſeleſs; and the old Caſtle is gone to Ruin, as is the Caſe of almoſt all the old Caſtles in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſhould not be forgotten, that notwithſtanding the Healthineſs of the Place, here broke out firſt that unaccountable Plague, call'd, <hi>The Sweating Sickneſs, Anno</hi> 1551; which ſpread itſelf thro' the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and afterwards into ſeveral foreign Nations.</p>
            <p>Here is a good Free-ſchool, the moſt conſiderable in this Part of <hi>England</hi>; built and endow'd by Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> with a very ſufficient Maintenance for a Chief or Head-Maſter, and Three Under-Maſters or Uſhers. The Buildings are very ſpacious, and particularly the Library, which has a great many Books in it. The School-maſters have alſo very handſome Houſes to dwell in; ſo that the whole has the Face of a College.</p>
            <p>There was a fine School here before, erected by the Town's-people, and maintain'd ſeveral Years by their Contribution. But the Queen took the Matter into her own Hands, and built the whole Fabrick new from the Ground, endowing it liberally out of her own Royal Bounty.</p>
            <p>Here I was ſhew'd a very viſible and remarkable Appearance of the great antient Road or Way call'd <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> which comes from <hi>London</hi> to this Town, and goes on from hence to the utmoſt Coaſt of <hi>Wales.</hi> Remains of a Stone Bridge are to be ſeen in the Bottom of the River, when the Water is low. This Road is raiſed a good Height above the Soil, and ſo ſtrait, that upon an Eminence you may ſee it Ten or Fifteen Miles before you, and as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, over many Hill-tops anſwering one the other as a Viſta of Trees.</p>
            <p>We lodg'd at an Inn called <hi>Iveſey-bank,</hi> on the Borders between <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire.</hi> About
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0141100402:359"/>
a Mile off in a large Wood ſtands <hi>Boſcobel-houſe,</hi> or <hi>White-Ladies,</hi> as ſome call it, where the <hi>Pendrils</hi> lived, who preſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> II. after <hi>Worceſter</hi> Battle, and famous for the Royal Oak. The Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter of that <hi>William Pendril</hi> ſtill liv'd in the Houſe, when I was there. The Floor of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, which is a Popiſh Chapel, (formerly a Nunnery in Poſſeſſion of the Family of <hi>Cookſey</hi>) being matted, prevents any Suſpicion of a little Cavity with a Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door over the Stair-caſe where the King was hid. His Bed was artfully plac'd behind ſome Wainſcot, that ſhut up very cloſe. A Deſcendant of the <hi>Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys</hi> ſtill keeps the Gloves and Garters, which his Majeſty left behind him.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Chapel is ſtill ſtanding, and has ſome painted Saints upon the Wall at one End.</p>
            <p>A Bow-ſhot from the Houſe, juſt by a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>track paſſing thro' the Wood, ſtood the Royal Oak, into which the King and Col. <hi>Carlos</hi> climbed, by means of the Hen-rooſt Ladder, when they thought it no longer ſafe to ſtay in the Houſe, the Family reaching them Victuals with the Nut-hook. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as the People related it to us, that whilſt the King and Colonel were in the Tree, a Party of the Enemy's Horſe, ſent to ſearch the Houſe, came whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling and talking along this Road; and when they were juſt under the Tree, an Owl flew out of a neighbouring Tree, and hover'd along the Ground, as if her Wings were broken, which the Soldiers merrily purſued.</p>
            <p>The Tree is now inclos'd within a Brick Wall, the Inſide whereof is cover'd with Laurel, of which we may ſay, as <hi>Ovid</hi> did of that of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,—<hi>Mediamque tuebere quercum.</hi> For the Oak is in the Middle, almoſt cut away by Travellers, whoſe Curioſity leads them to ſee it. Cloſe by the Side grows a young thriving Plant from one of its Acorns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:0141100402:360"/>After the Reſtoration, the King, reviewing the Place, no doubt, with very different Emotions to what he had when he was in it, gather'd ſome of the Acorns, and ſet them in <hi>St. James's Park</hi> or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and us'd to water them himſelf. If we may judge of the Value the King put upon his Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Royal Perſon, it was worth 200<hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and one ſhould think a King, if worth any thing, worth that; for ſo much he gave to <hi>Pendril,</hi> and it now remains in the Family. Over the Door of the Incloſure is this Inſcription cut in Marble:

            <p>Ten Miles South-eaſt of <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> ſtands <hi>Great Wenlock,</hi> an antient Borough and good Market-town. The noted <hi>Wreken-hill</hi> ſtands higher up, North of it, between the <hi>Watlingſtreet</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> and within a Mile of <hi>Wroxeter,</hi> the famous <hi>Roman</hi> Station. It aſcends gradually from a pleaſant level Ground, ſtrikes out a pretty great Length, and is well adorn'd with Trees. 'Tis the higheſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0141100402:361"/>
Ground in all the County, and gives a fine Proſpect all around it.</p>
            <p>Following <hi>the Watling ſtreet</hi> North, we came to a ſmall Market-town call'd <hi>Wellington,</hi> of very little Note; and ſtill keeping <hi>the Street,</hi> we arrived at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> on the Borders of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> a little Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-town, where is one of the nobleſt Foundations for a School in the whole Kingdom, endowed by one <hi>Adams,</hi> an Haberdaſher of <hi>London,</hi> to the Value of 7000<hi>l.</hi> The School is 70 Feet long, 22 wide, and the ſame in Height, a Library, a Houſe for both the Maſter and Uſher, 60<hi>l.</hi> a Year to the firſt, and 30<hi>l.</hi> to the other, and a Garden to each Houſe of an Acre, and Two Acres for the Boys to play in. Near it he has likewiſe built an Alms-houſe, and gave 550<hi>l.</hi> towards building the Town-houſe. Over the School-door is this Diſtich:

where happen'd to be a Fair. We were ſurpriſed to ſee the prodigious Number of the fineſt and moſt beautiful Horſes that can any-where be ſeen, brought hither from <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and all the Horſe-breeding Counties in <hi>England:</hi> we were told there were not leſs than an hundred Joc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys or Horſe-kopers, as they call them there, from <hi>London,</hi> to buy Horſes for Sale. Alſo an incredible Number of Gentlemen attended with their Grooms, to buy Hunters and good Road Horſes. In a Word, I believe I may mark it for the greateſt Horſe-Fair in the World, for Horſes of Value, and eſpecially thoſe we call Saddle-Horſes; tho' there were great Numbers of fine large Stone-Horſes for Coach and Draught too.</p>
            <p>From hence we came in Two Hours eaſy Riding to <hi>Stafford,</hi> on the River <hi>Sow.</hi> 'Tis an antient Town, and gives Name to the County; but we thought to have found in it ſomething more worth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much out of the Way for. It is however neat and well-built, and pleaſantly ſeated in low Grounds, and is lately much increaſed, and grown rich by the Clothing-trade. It is governed by a Mayor, and other inferior Officers, conſiſts of Two Pariſhes, and has a good Free-ſchool. 'Tis ſaid this Town retains the antient Cuſtom of <hi>Borough Engliſh,</hi> which is, that the youngeſt Sons inherit the Lands of their Fathers within the Town. Here is likewiſe a fine ſquare Market-place, where ſtands the Shire-Hall, and the Streets are well paved.</p>
            <p>We tarry'd here a few Days, in order to viſit the Towns lying on each Side of it, with more At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Convenience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eccleſhall</hi> lies North-weſt of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and is a pretty Market-town noted for Pedlery-wares; and a little Market-town call'd <hi>Stone,</hi> lies upon the <hi>Trent.</hi>

               <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> a very antient Town, ſituate on an Hill, which is well-built, pav'd, and inhabited. Here the Trade of Lock-making is carry'd on to great Perfection.

            <p>
               <hi>Walſal,</hi> Eaſt of <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> is a good, pleaſant Corporate-town, governed by a Mayor, and ſituate on the Top of an Hill.

               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0141100402:364"/>Upon the Extremity of the County, South, juſt on the Borders of <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> is ſituate upon a high Mountain, the famous antient Caſtle of <hi>Dudley,</hi> a Building of great Extent with Trenches about it, cut out of a Rock, and hath a high Tower upon it, on the South-ſide. It was built by <hi>Dodo</hi> a <hi>Saxon,</hi> in 700. Great Part of it is in Ruins, and the reſt is converted into a noble Seat, where the Lord <hi>Dudley</hi> and <hi>Ward</hi> reſides. The Caſtle over-tops all the Trees that ſurround it, and has a moſt extenſive Proſpect over Five Shires, and into part of <hi>Wales.</hi> In the Hall of this Caſtle is a Table all of one intire Plank, which, before it was fitted up there, was 25 Yards long, and 1 Yard in Breadth; but being too long for the Hall, 7 Yards and 9 Inches of it was cut off, and made a Table for the Hall of a neighbouring Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. What a prodigious Oak muſt this have been, that had a Length of 25 Yards, and a Diameter of one Yard from one End to the other!</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Dudley</hi> lies near it, but in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire</hi>; and is only remarkable for being in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent County from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The People in this County have been more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly famous than any other for good Footman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and there have been, and ſtill are among them, ſome of the fleeteſt Runners in <hi>England</hi>; which muſt be owing to their exerciſing themſelves to it from their Childhood; for running Foot-races ſeems to be the general Sport or Diverſion of the Country.</p>
            <p>Near <hi>Stafford</hi> we ſaw <hi>Ingeſtre,</hi> where the late <hi>Walter Chetwynd,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> built, or rather rebuilt, a very fine Church at his own Charge, and where the late Lord <hi>Chetwynd</hi> has, with a Profuſion of Expence, laid out the fineſt Park and Gardens that are in this Part of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now at the utmoſt Extent of my propoſed Limits for this Circuit; for <hi>Ingeſtre</hi> Parks reach to
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0141100402:365"/>
the very Banks of the <hi>Trent.</hi> So I turn'd to the Right, and intending for <hi>Litchfield,</hi> in the Way we ſaw <hi>Beaudeſert,</hi> a famous old Seat, ſaid to be built by <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The Name indeed intimates it to be of <hi>Norman</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Original; at preſent it is in the noble Family of <hi>Paget,</hi> Earl of <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> who is ſtyled Baron of <hi>Beaudeſert.</hi> The Park is very fine, and its Situation exceeding pleaſant, but the Houſe is antient. In the Park is a famous Piece of Antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> a large Camp or Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſurrounded with a double Trench, very large and deep.</p>
            <p>From hence 'tis about four or five Miles to the City of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> the principal, next to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> of all the North-weſt Part of <hi>England</hi>; nor indeed is there any other, but this and <hi>Coventry,</hi> in the whole Road from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> which is on the Edge of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Rugely,</hi> which is an handſome well-built Town, finely ſituated near the <hi>Trent,</hi> we came into the great <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Road, or the North-weſt Road from <hi>London,</hi> which paſſing through this City from <hi>Warrington-bridge</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> falls into the <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> mention'd before, about Three Miles South-eaſt from the Town, and croſſes another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Cauſeway or Road, call'd <hi>Icknild-ſtreet,</hi> about a Mile out of the City; ſo that <hi>Litchfield</hi> lies, as it were, at the joining of all thoſe great Roads. But inſtead of going directly to <hi>Litchfield,</hi> we ſtruck out of the Road, and went North-eaſt to <hi>Bromley,</hi> a pretty Market-town; and from thence Eaſt to <hi>Tutbury</hi> on the Skirts of <hi>Derbyſhire:</hi> It has a ſmall Market-town with a Caſtle in it.</p>
            <p>Some Miles Southward ſtands <hi>Burton upon Trent,</hi> where the Clothing-trade is carried on with great Advantage. It is famous for its noble Bridge over the <hi>Trent,</hi> conſiſting of 34 Arches, and of the Length
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0141100402:366"/>
of 515 Yards. It is built of Free-ſtone cut and ſquared.</p>
            <p>From hence we returned South-weſt to <hi>Litchfield,</hi> which is a fine, neat, well-built, and pretty large City. It roſe from the Ruins of the <hi>Roman Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetum</hi> a Mile off, now called <hi>Cheſterfield-wall,</hi> from ſome Reliques of its Fortifications. There is a kind of ſlow, ſluggiſh Water which runs, or rather glides heavily, thro' it, and ſo on for Four or Five Miles farther into the <hi>Trent,</hi> but takes a ſwifter Motion as ſoon as it is out of the Town. This Water parts the City into Two: one Part is call'd the Town, and the other the Cloſe; in the firſt is the Market-place, a fine School, and a very handſome Hoſpital well endow'd. This Part is much the largeſt and moſt populous: but the other is the faireſt, has the beſt Buildings in it, and, among the reſt, the Cathedral Church, one of the fineſt and moſt beautiful in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Two fine Cauſeways, which join the City and the Cloſe, with Sluices to let the Water paſs; but thoſe were cut thro' in the Time of the late inteſtine Wars in <hi>England</hi>; and the Cloſe, which is wall'd about, and was then fortify'd for the King, was very ſtrong, and ſtood out ſeveral Attacks againſt <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Men, and was not at laſt taken without great Loſs of Blood on both Sides, being gallantly defended, and at laſt taken by Storm.</p>
            <p>There are in the Cloſe, beſides the Houſes of the Clergy Reſidentiaries, a great many very well-built, and well-inhabited Houſes, which made <hi>Litchfield</hi> a Place of good Company, above all the Towns in this or the neighbouring Counties of <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> or <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The See is very antient, and was once Archiepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal, made ſo by King <hi>Offa</hi>; and <hi>Eadulph</hi> the Archbiſhop was Metropolitan of all the Kingdom of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Angles</hi>; but it did not hold
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0141100402:367"/>
it; then it ſuffer'd another Diminution, by having the See of <hi>Cheſter</hi> taken away, which was once Part of this.</p>
            <p>They told us here a long Story of St. <hi>Chad,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Biſhop of this Church, and how he liv'd an Eremitical Life here, by the Spring near <hi>Stow</hi> Church, in a little Hovel or Cell. But the Biſhops, ſince that Time, fare better, and make ſhift with a very fine Palace in the Cloſe, and the Reſidentiaries live in Proportion to them.</p>
            <p>They have another Legendary Story alſo at <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>; namely, that a thouſand poor People, being inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith by the Care of <hi>Offa</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> were all martyr'd here in one Field by the <hi>Pagans</hi>; and that in the Field where they were ſo murder'd, King <hi>Oſwy</hi> of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> cauſed a great Church to be built; and from thence the City bears for its Device an open Field, with mangled Carcaſſes lying diſpers'd about in it, as if murder'd, and left unburied.</p>
            <p>The Church, for the Elegancy and Regularity of the Building, may be eſteemed one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in <hi>England.</hi> The Weſt-end is richly decorated with the Statues of all the Kings who reigned in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to the Captivity. But it is too flat, and wants Projection, or, as Architects call it, <hi>Relief,</hi> to give it Boldneſs. The Two Towers are much too low for their Breadth, and look very heavy for want of Windows, eſpecially where the Bells hang. The circular Stair-caſes projecting octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonally at one Angle only of each, without any of the other Three Angles anſwering, is a great Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. But the Spires above them are carried up in an exceeding beautiful Taſte, much beyond any other <hi>Gothick</hi> Spires that I have ſeen. The middle Tower and Spire of this Church are much higher than thoſe at the Weſt-end, and are equally beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:0141100402:368"/>The Spire deſigned for the Middle of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Abbey,</hi> is an Imitation of the middle Spire of this Church.</p>
            <p>The great Window over the middle Door is very large, and its Pediment finely adorn'd, a large Croſs finiſhing the Top of it.</p>
            <p>The Imagery and carv'd Work on the Front, as above, ſuffer'd much in the late unhappy Times; and they told us, the Croſs over the Weſt Window was frequently ſhot at by the rude Soldiers; but that they could not ſhoot it down.</p>
            <p>The Saints of thoſe Days alſo intirely ruin'd all the Ornaments of the Inſide, with the Braſs Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Tombs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is built in the midſt of a Bog for Security, and held out ſome fierce Attacks for King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and what the Outſide ſuffer'd, has been very well repair'd ſince the Reſtoration, as well by the famous Biſhop <hi>Hacket,</hi> as by the Bounty of ſeveral noble and generous Benefactors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Monaſticon</hi> makes Mention of a Shrine given here for the Holy St. <hi>Chad,</hi> or St. <hi>Cedda,</hi> which coſt 200,000<hi>l.</hi> but I conceive that to ſmell as much of the Legend, as the Miracles of St. <hi>Chad</hi> himſelf; ſince ſuch a Gift at that Time muſt be equal to Two Millions of our Money.</p>
            <p>Antient Camps are found in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Litchfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Litchfield</hi> we came to <hi>Tamworth,</hi> a fine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant trading Town, eminent for good Ale, and good Company, of the middling Sort; and alſo for a fine Charity of the famous Bookſeller, Mr. <hi>Guy,</hi> who built and endow'd the noble Hoſpital in <hi>Southwark,</hi> called by his Name. The Town ſtands on the River <hi>Tame,</hi> which runs through it, and divides it into Two Parts, one Part whereof is in this County, and the other in <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> It is a Bailiwick Town, and a Place of good Account, tho' it has been much more conſiderable. Here was antiently a Palace of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0141100402:369"/>
the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kings, and there is ſtill remaining a ſquare Trench, call'd the King's Dyke. This Town was given by the Conqueror to the <hi>Marmyons,</hi> who built the Caſtle here, and were hereditary Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of <hi>England,</hi> from whom that Office deſcended to the <hi>Dymokes</hi> of <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Tamworth</hi> we came to <hi>Sutton-Colefield,</hi> a little Town ſituated in an excellent Air, and among pleaſant Woods, tho' but in a barren Soil; and then we came into the great Road again at <hi>Coleſhill</hi> in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire,</hi> a ſmall, but very handſome Market-town; from whence we came to <hi>Coventry,</hi> the Siſter City to <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and join'd in the Title of See, which was for ſome little Time ſeated here, but afterwards return'd to <hi>Litchfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coventry</hi> is a City of large Extent and populous, and drives a very great Trade: the Manufacture of Tammies is their chief Imploy, and next to that, weaving of Ribbons of the meaneſt kind, chiefly black. The Buildings are very old, and in ſome Places very much decayed; the Timber-built Houſes project forwards into the Street towards one another, inſomuch that in the narrow Streets they almoſt touch at the Top; a Method of Building formerly much practiſed in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tale of the Lady <hi>Godiva,</hi> who rode naked thro' the High-Street of this City, to purchaſe its Exemption from oppreſſive Taxes, is held for ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Truth, that they will not have it queſtion'd upon any Account whatſoever; and in Memory of it, the Inhabitants make a Proceſſion yearly with a naked Figure of a Woman riding on Horſe-back thro' the City; and the Picture of the poor Fellow who peep'd out of the Window to ſee her, is ſtill kept up, looking out of a Garret in the High-Street of the City: but Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ſays poſitively, nobody look'd at her at all. Two Parliaments have been held in this City, both remarkably denominated; one
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0141100402:370"/>
in the 6th of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. called <hi>Parliamentum Indoctorum</hi>; the other in the 38th of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. called <hi>Parliamentum Diabolicum,</hi> becauſe of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder paſs'd in it againſt the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> and its Partiſans.</p>
            <p>At the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. the Walls and Towers of the City were demoliſh'd, by that Prince's Command, and only the Gates of it left ſtanding; by which the Beauty and Strength of the reſt may be gueſs'd at.</p>
            <p>This City is a County incorporate of itſelf, and has a great many Towns within its Liberties, holds Pleas, and is govern'd by a Mayor, 10 Aldermen, and Sub-officers; but it had only Two Pariſh Churches, that of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and the Church of <hi>St. Michael,</hi> which were unable to hold half the Inhabitants, till the Year 1734, when an Act paſſed for making the Church of <hi>Bablack</hi> in <hi>Coventry</hi> a Pariſh Church, and for appointing a Diſtrict or Pariſh thereto, and for enabling the Maſter and Uſher of the Free Grammar-ſchool within the ſaid City, to be the Rector and Lecturer of the ſaid Pariſh Church, for all time to come. This is called in the Act the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> in the City of <hi>Coventry.</hi> Beſides theſe Three Churches and Pariſhes, it has Four Steeples; and the Croſs is notedly one of its greateſt Ornaments. The Roads are kept well pav'd to it for a Mile round. Here is a good Free-ſchool, founded by <hi>John Hales,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> by the Name of the School of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. the Maſter of which is to be, for the future, the Miniſter of the new Pariſh Church, as I have mentioned. It has a good Library; and there is alſo an Hoſpital for the Poor. But here is no Cathedral, as ſome have falſly ſaid; neither is the great Church, ſo called, either Collegiate or Conventual; but only a Monaſtery or Priory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:0141100402:371"/>Yet this City contended a great while for thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Honour, but could not carry it. In King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.'s Time, the Priory being diſſolv'd, the Church, which they would have call'd a Cathedral, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a private Pariſh Church, and continues ſo to this Day: 'tis alſo an Archdeaconry, and the Biſhop is ſtyled Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spire of the great Church is however very beautiful, and 100 Yards high. There is another good Church in the ſame Yard; the Croſs, a fine <hi>Gothick</hi> Work, 66 Feet high; and in Niches are the Statues of ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings. At the South-end of the Town ſtands a tall Spire by itſelf, being what is left of the <hi>Grey Friers</hi> Conventual Church. The Town-houſe is worth ſeeing; the Windows of it are painted Glaſs, repreſenting ſome of the old Kings, Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have been Benefactors to the Town.</p>
            <p>And a Copy of <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes are there to be read, in Praiſe of their Royal Benefactors, in which are named the <hi>Edwards,</hi> the <hi>Henries,</hi> the Black Prince, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the great Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Coventry</hi> we could by no means paſs the Town of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Diſtance too being but about Six Miles, and a very pleaſant Way on the Banks of the River <hi>Avon:</hi> 'Tis famous for being the Reſidence of the great <hi>Guy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> of whom Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition has deliver'd down to us ſo many hyperbolical Accounts, that it is hardly poſſible to diſtinguiſh his real Actions from what are fabulous. He flouriſhed in the Reign of <hi>Athelſtane,</hi> and decided the Fate of the Kingdom by Compact, in ſingle Combat with <hi>Colbrond</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> a Man of gigantick Stature, whom he ſlew, and afterwards led a Hermit's Life, till his Death. They ſhew us here his Caſtle, his Helmet, his Sword, and tell abundance of things of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0141100402:372"/>
him, which have ſome Appearance of Hiſtory, tho' not much Authority to ſupport them. So I leave that Part to the curious Searchers into Antiquity, who may conſult Mr. <hi>Camden, Rous, Dugdale,</hi> and other Antiquaries on that Subject, who tell us the Caſtle was built before our Saviour's Time, and has been a Place of great Conſideration ever ſince.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Warwick,</hi> it is really a fine Town, pleaſantly ſituated on the Bank of the <hi>Avon,</hi> over which is a large and ſtately Bridge, the <hi>Avon</hi> being now grown a pretty large River. <hi>Warwick</hi> has ſuffer'd much from all Quarters. It was once deſtroy'd by the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi>; after which the famous <hi>Caractacus</hi> (who at the Head of the <hi>Silures</hi> oppos'd the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo long) rebuilt it, erecting there alſo a Palace for himſelf. Then the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Oſtorius,</hi> and after them the <hi>Saxons,</hi> greatly damaged it; and laſtly, the ravaging <hi>Danes</hi> ruined it.</p>
            <p>Tho' it was a Corporation by Preſcription, yet it took a Charter from <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſince from <hi>James</hi> I. and is now governed by a Bailiff, and 12 Burgeſſes. It has a handſome Stone-built Market-houſe upheld by Pillars; and here is a good Free-ſchool, and a well-endow'd Hoſpital for decayed Gentlemen. Tho' it has been always accounted a handſome well-built Town, yet the Face of it is now quite alter'd and improv'd; for having been almoſt wholly reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbiſh, by a terrible Fire, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd the Fifth Day of <hi>September</hi> 1694, by the mere Accident of a Spark being blown from a Stick, as it was carried croſs a Lane, to the Damage of 96,000<hi>l.</hi> it was rebuilt by Act of Parliament, and that in ſo noble and beautiful a manner, that few Towns in <hi>England</hi> make ſo fine an Appearance.</p>
            <p>The Church and lofty Tower is new-built, except the Eaſt-end, which is old, and very good Work. There are many fine Braſs Monuments of the Earls of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and others; alſo one of the Earl of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0141100402:373"/>
               <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s unhappy Favourite; and many Chapels and Confeſſionaries. In the Chapter-houſe on the North-ſide is a Tomb of the Lord <hi>Brook.</hi> The Caſtle ſtands upon the River <hi>Avon</hi> on a ſolid Rock, from whoſe Bowels that and the whole Town may be ſaid to have been dug. The Terrace of the Caſtle, like that of <hi>Windſor,</hi> overlooks a beautiful Country, and ſees the <hi>Avon</hi> running at the Foot of the Precipice, from above 50 Feet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Height; for the ſolid Rock, from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on which it ſtands, it 40 Feet high, but on the North-ſide it is even with the Town. The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is old, but has been often repair'd and beautify'd; and 'tis now a very agreeable Structure both within and without. The Apartments are very nicely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and the Communication of the remoteſt Parts of the Building, one with another, is ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by Galleries, and by the great Hall, which is very magnificent, that one finds no Irregularity in the whole Building, notwithſtanding its antient Plan, as it was a Caſtle, built for Strength rather than a Palace to dwell in for Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>A Stone Bridge with a Dozen Arches is at the Caſtle; acroſs is a Stone-work Dam, where the Water falls over it as a Caſcade under the Caſtle Wall. It is fenc'd with a deep Mound, and ſtrong embattled double Walls and lofty Towers. On one Side the Area is a very high Mount. There are good Apartments and Lodgings next the River, the Reſidence of the Lord <hi>Brook.</hi> The Priory, on the North-eaſt of the Town overlooks a pleaſant woody Vale. There are a great many curious original Pictures in the Caſtle, by <hi>Vandyke</hi> and other good Hands, of Kings, Queens, and other noble Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Foreign.</p>
            <p>A Mile out of Town, on the Side of a Hill, is a pretty retired Cell, called <hi>Guy-cliff.</hi> In an old Chapel is <hi>Guy</hi>'s Statue, Eight Feet high. The
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0141100402:374"/>
Fence of the Court is intire Rock, in which are cut Stables and Out-houſes. They ſhew'd us the rough Cave, where they ſay the famous <hi>Guy</hi> dy'd an Hermit.</p>
            <p>While I was ſtation'd, as I may ſay, at <hi>Warwick,</hi> I took a Turn about the Country, to view ſuch Places of Note, as lay ſomething out of my intended Rout. And firſt, paſſing a Rivulet, I came to the antient <hi>Tripontium,</hi> plac'd in a pleaſant little Valley, the Sides of which are pretty ſteep. The Road on the oppoſite Hill looks perfectly like a Perſpective-ſcene at the Theatre. This is a <hi>Roman</hi> Station, rightly plac'd at <hi>Dovebridge</hi> upon the <hi>Avon,</hi> running by <hi>Rugby</hi> to <hi>Warwick.</hi> The Stream here divides into two, with a Bridge over each. Upon one is a ſhort Inſcription in Stone, ſhewing the three Counties which repair it.</p>
            <p>Near this Place, at <hi>Legers-Aſhby</hi> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> has been an old Town, as they ſay, deſtroy'd by the <hi>Danes. Catesby,</hi> who hatch'd the Powder-plot, own'd the Town.</p>
            <p>We went on to <hi>Daventry,</hi> a conſiderable Market-town, govern'd by a Mayor, Aldermen, Steward, and 12 Freemen. It lies on the great Road to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and is conſequently a great Thorough-fare, and well furniſh'd with good Inns; for it ſubſiſts chiefly by the great Concourſe of Travellers that paſs that way. It lies alſo on the old <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> Way. The Road was turn'd to paſs through the Town, and runs on to <hi>Dunſmore-heath,</hi> where it croſſes the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> and one Branch goes on to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and the other joins the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> and goes on to a Place call'd <hi>High-croſs,</hi> of which further anon, where it falls into the old <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtreet,</hi> and both meet again near <hi>Litchfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a moſt pleaſant Curioſity to obſerve the Courſe of theſe old famous Highways, the <hi>Ikenild</hi> Way, the <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> and the <hi>Foſſe</hi>; in which one ſees ſo lively a Repreſentatation of the antient <hi>Britiſh,</hi>

               <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Governments, that one cannot help recalling thoſe Times to the Imagination; and though I am confin'd to ſuch narrow Limits in this Work, yet a Circuit or Tour thro' <hi>England</hi> would be very imperfect, if I ſhould take no Notice of theſe Ways, ſeeing in tracing them we neceſſarily come to the principal Towns, either that are or have been in every County; and likewiſe in mentioning their Remains, we give ſome Account of them as in their preſent State, which falls directly in with my Deſign.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Daventry</hi> we went a little out of the Road, to ſee a great Camp, call'd <hi>Burrow-hill,</hi> upon the North End of an Eminence, cover'd over with Fern and and Goſs. Here uſed to be kept a Horſe-race. They ſay this was a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Camp, and every thing hereabouts is attributed to the <hi>Danes,</hi> becauſe of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Daventry,</hi> which they ſuppoſe to be built by them. The Road hereabouts too being overgrown with Daneweed, they fanſy it ſprung from the Blood of the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſlain in Battle; and that if upon a certain Day in the Year you cut it, it bleeds. Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it ſeems to have been <hi>Roman,</hi> but perhaps new-modell'd by the <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Norton</hi> Town Road a <hi>Cornu Ammonis</hi> lies neglected, too big to bring away.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Weedon</hi> is ſhewn the Scite of King <hi>Wolfhere</hi>'s Palace; the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings of this Province reſiding here. The Paſtures call'd, <hi>The Aſhes</hi> are the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp. St. <hi>Werberg,</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Wolfhere,</hi> and Abbeſs to the Nunnery in this Place, had here a Chapel. Abundance of very fine Stone, and many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, have been dug up. <hi>Weedon</hi> now contains two Pariſhes, and has been a Market-town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Towceſter</hi> is a conſiderable Town between two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, which encompaſs it almoſt round.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Old Stretford</hi> ſtands on the oppoſite Side of the <hi>Owſe</hi> to <hi>Stony-Stratford</hi>; in the Fields thereabouts are found many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:0141100402:376"/>A little North of the <hi>Horſeſhoe-inn</hi> ſtood Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Croſs, which was pull'd down in the Civil Wars.</p>
            <p>To the Weſt of <hi>Stretford</hi> ſtands <hi>Whaddon-hall,</hi> upon very high Ground, affording a moſt beautiful Proſpect. This Manor formerly belong'd to the Lords <hi>Grey</hi>; one of whom, a Knight of the Garter, is buried in the Church. Here is the original Picture of Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> the Progenitor of the preſent Poſſeſſor, with many of his MSS. Letters, Conſultations, Lectures, and other Works unpubliſh'd. The Poets <hi>Spencer</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> honour'd this Place with their Reſidence. Still higher ſtands <hi>Stukely:</hi> The Church is very intire, tho' built before the Conqueſt, in the plain antient manner.</p>
            <p>I now come to <hi>Northampton,</hi> the handſomeſt Town in all this Part of <hi>England</hi>; but here, as at <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Beauty of it is owing to its Diſaſter; for it was ſo effectually burnt down, that very few Houſes were left ſtanding; and, altho' the Fire began in the Day-time, the Flame ſpread itſelf with ſuch Fury, and Speed, that they tell us, a Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being two Miles off, upon a Hill, on the South-ſide of the Town, ſaw the Fire at one End of it, juſt as it began; and before he could reach the Town, with all the Speed he could, the other End was in Flames alſo. 'Tis now finely rebuilt with Brick and Stone, and the Streets made ſpacious and wide. It has four Churches, two Hoſpitals, and a Charity-ſchool well endow'd. The Market-place is ſquare and ſpacious; the Aſſize-houſe is built after the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Order. <hi>Allhallows</hi> Church is a pretty Edifice, with a Cupola, and a noble Portico, before it, of 8 lofty <hi>Ionick</hi> Columns. Upon the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrade is a Statue of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. It is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on the River <hi>Nyne,</hi> over which there are two handſome Bridges, and is walled in; and on the Weſt ſide are the Remains of an old Caſtle, upon an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0141100402:377"/>
'Tis govern'd by a Mayor, two Bailiffs, a Recorder, <hi>&amp;c. All-Saints</hi> Church before-mention'd ſtands in a Centre, where four large ſpacious Streets terminate. The publick Buildings are eſteem'd the fineſt that can be ſeen in any County-town in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being all new-built. But that Writer took very little Notice of <hi>Northampton,</hi> or rather had never ſeen it, who told us of a Cathedral, a Chapter-houſe, and a Cloyſter.</p>
            <p>The great Inn called the <hi>George,</hi> at the Corner of the High-Street, looks more like a Palace than an Inn, and coſt above 2000<hi>l.</hi> building; and ſo generous was the Owner, that, as we were told, when he had built it, he gave it to the Poor of the Town.</p>
            <p>This is counted the Centre of all the Horſe-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and Horſe-Fairs in <hi>England,</hi> there being here no leſs than four Fairs in a Year. And indeed <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> is reckoned the Navel of <hi>England.</hi> Here they buy Horſes of all Sorts, as well for the Saddle as for the Coach and Cart; and hither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">

            <p>Near <hi>Northampton</hi> is the antient Royal Houſe of <hi>Holmeby,</hi> which was formerly in great Eſteem, and by its Situation is capable of being made a truly Royal Palace. But the melancholy Reflection of the Impriſonment of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in this Houſe, and his being violently taken hence again by the Rebels, has caſt a kind of Diſgrace upon the Place, ſo that it has been forſaken. The Houſe and Eſtate was purchas'd by the Ducheſs of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Part of the Jointure which was ſettled on the Marchioneſs of <hi>Blandford.</hi> It is at preſent poſſeſſed by a Farmer, who has pull'd down Part of the Out-houſes, and converted the remaining Part into Barns, Stables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little way off of <hi>Northampton</hi> is <hi>Naſeby,</hi> where the bloody and fatal Battle was fought between the

Royaliſts and Parliamentarians, upon a fine Plain, where at preſent ſtands a Wind-mill; and on it, are the Marks of ſeveral great Holes, where the Slain were buried; and near this is <hi>Guildsborough,</hi> ſo nam'd from a <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, of a ſquare Form, and deep Ditch, called <hi>The Burrows.</hi>

            <p>The Seat of the Earl of <hi>Pomfret,</hi> near <hi>Towceſter,</hi> is a ſtately Building, and ſtands pleaſantly amidſt good Plantations of Wood, Viſta's, and fine Proſpects. In the grand View to the back Front, beyond the Garden, is a large and long Canal. Several curious Pictures are in the Houſe. But what inhances the Glory of this Seat is, the vaſt Number of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Marbles, Statues, Buſto's, Bas-reliefs, Urns, Altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Part of the invaluable Collection of the great Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and which are worthy of a Journey through half the Globe to behold.

The Inhabitants of all Ages are here imploy'd in a ſilken Manufacture, and Lace-making. The Town conſiſts of one long Street, and is almoſt intirely incompaſs'd with Water.</p>
            <p>The Houſe late the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s, at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe,</hi> now belonging to the Hon. <hi>John Spencer,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Brother to his Grace the preſent Duke of <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> who is Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> has within theſe few Years changed its Face to much Advantage. This antient Seat was rebuilt with great Improvement, by <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> Grandfather to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi>; and is particularly noted for a magnificent Gallery, furniſh'd with a large Collection of curious Paintings, by the beſt Hands.</p>
            <p>The Park is laid out and planted, after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of that at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and was deſign'd by <hi>Le Notre,</hi> the ſame Perſon who planted St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, and <hi>Caſſioberry</hi>; as alſo ſeveral other Parks and Gardens in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a noble Piece of Water here, on which is lately built a fine Veſſel, completely equipp'd; as his Grace the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> has alſo at his Seat at <hi>Woburn-Abbey.</hi> There is likewiſe on this Water a fine <hi>Venetian</hi> Gondola, Canoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this Water is ſituated too near the Houſe, and occaſions ſo great a Damp, that ſome of the Pictures in the Gallery are mildew'd thereby.</p>
            <p>At a convenient Diſtance from the Houſe, is lately built a handſome Square of Offices, and near theſe is a large Kitchen-Garden finely walled and planted, in which is a handſome Building, for the Reſidence of the Gardener, which is a Model of an <hi>Italian</hi> Villa.</p>
            <p>From hence we went North towards <hi>Harborough,</hi> and in the Way, in the Midſt of deep diſmal Roads, the dirtieſt and worſt in all that Part of the Country, we ſaw <hi>Boughton,</hi> the noble Seat of the Duke of <hi>Montagu,</hi> a Houſe built by the firſt Duke, very

much after the Model of the Palace of <hi>Verſailles</hi>; the treble Wings projecting and expanded, forming a Court or Space wider and wider, in proper Stades, anſwerable to the Wings, the Body of the Houſe cloſing the whole View.</p>
            <p>The Hall is a very noble Room; on the Ceiling is a Convocation of the Gods, admirably painted, as are many Suites of Rooms, Stair-caſes, Galleries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſide the great Number of Portraits and other curious Pictures. The Gardens contain 90 Acres, adorn'd with Statues, Flower-pots, Urns of Marble and Metal, many very large Baſons, with Variety of Fountains playing, Aviaries, Reſervoirs, Fiſh-ponds, Canals, Wilderneſſes, Terraces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Caſcade is very fine, and a whole River running thro' the Length of the Gardens, is diverſify'd moſt agreeably to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete its Beauty.</p>
            <p>The Park is walled round with Brick, and ſo finely planted with Trees, and in ſuch an excellent Order, that I ſaw nothing more beautiful, no not in <hi>Italy</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, except that the Walks of Trees were not Orange and Lemon, and Citron, as it is in <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and other Southern Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Mile off is <hi>Geddington,</hi> where, in a Trivium, ſtands one of the Stone Croſſes, built by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> I. in Memory of his Queen <hi>Eleanor.</hi> Theſe are ſaid to be the Places where the Corps of that Princeſs reſted, and Croſſes erected, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Willoughby</hi> Side of the Road is an Hillock, call'd <hi>Croſs-hill,</hi> where the Country-people obſerve an anniverſary Feſtival. <hi>Willoughby</hi> Brook plays in delightful Meanders along a Valley between Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, with a moderate Water, unleſs raiſed by Rains. Here ſeveral braſs and ſilver Coins have been found, and ſome of Gold. The People have a Notion of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0141100402:381"/>
great Riches being hid under-ground; and there is a vulgar Report, that under one <hi>Balk</hi> or <hi>Mere,</hi> that is, Diviſion, between the ploughed Fields, there is as much Money, as would purchaſe the whole Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but they dare not dig, they pretend, for fear of Spirits. Moſaic Pavements, Coins, Pot-hooks, Fire-ſhovels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been alſo found.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Willoughby</hi> Town is an handſome Croſs of one Stone, five Yards long. The Parliament Soldiers had ty'd Ropes about it to pull it down; but the Vicar quench'd their Zeal with ſome ſtrong Beer, after having harangued them concerning its Innocence.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Coſſington,</hi> near the River <hi>Wrek,</hi> is a vaſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, 350 Feet long, 120 broad, 40 high, or near it, very handſomely work'd up on the Sides, and very ſteep. It is call'd <hi>Shipley-hill,</hi> from a great Captain of that Name, who, they ſay, was here buried. On the Top are ſeveral oblong doubled Trenches cut in the Turf, where the Lads and Laſſes of the adjacent Villages meet on <hi>Eaſter-monday</hi> to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Cakes and Ale.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Erdborough</hi> is a ſtrong <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, 800 Feet long, of a delightful Proſpect. Near it is a petrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spring.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not omit, as I had like to have done, the Town of <hi>Wellingborough</hi> in the County of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a large, well-built, and well-inhabited Town, with a fine Church, and Free-ſchool. A dreadful Fire which happen'd here in <hi>July</hi> 1738, has made the Town ſtill more beautiful, tho' the Occaſion was too melancholy to be wiſh'd for. It began at a Dyer's Houſe in the Town, about two in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and in the Space of Six Hours conſumed near 220 Houſes, beſides Out-houſes, Barns, Stables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amounting in the Whole to upwards of 800, moſtly in the South and Eaſt Parts of the Town. The Wind being high, and but little Water to be had,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0141100402:382"/>
the Fire was ſo fierce and violent, that it ſeem'd to break out at twenty Places at once, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were in ſuch Confuſion, that but few of them had Time to ſave any Goods, and many only the Cloaths on their Backs. As it happen'd chiefly among the Trading Men and Farmers, the Loſs upon them was very heavy. But it was a good deal alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by the ſignal Charity of the neighbouring Gentlemen and others, which ſaved many of the poor Sufferers from periſhing for Want.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>March,</hi> following this dreadful Fire, another happen'd at <hi>Findon,</hi> two Miles from <hi>Wellingborough,</hi> which conſumed 16 Houſes.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Boughton</hi> we went on to <hi>Harborough,</hi> a good Market-town, and great Thorough-fare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go forward to <hi>Leiceſter</hi>; but Curioſity turn'd us Weſt a little, to ſee an old Town call'd <hi>Lutterworth,</hi> famous for being the Birth-place of <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> the firſt Preacher of the Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Diſciples were afterwards called <hi>Lollards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church was lately beautify'd, and pav'd with a coſtly Pavement of chequer'd Stone; and the Pews are new, and every thing in it both in Church and Chancel, except the Pulpit, of thick Oak-Planks, ſix-ſquare, which is preſerv'd on account of its being <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Pulpit.</p>
            <p>Being thus got a little out of our Way, we turn'd Weſt into the <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> Way, at <hi>High-croſs,</hi> where the Foſs croſſes it, and which, I ſuppoſe, occaſion'd the Name, leaving <hi>Rugby</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> a ſmall Town, noted only for a great Number of Butchers, on the South-weſt of us. At this Croſs we ſeem'd to be in the Centre, and higheſt Ground of <hi>England</hi>; for from hence Rivers run every way. The <hi>Foſſe</hi> went acroſs the Back-ſide of our Inn, and ſo towards <hi>Bath.</hi> Here are divers <hi>Roman</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:

its antient Appellation was <hi>Benonis.</hi> The late Earl of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and the Gentlemen in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, erected here a Croſs of an handſome Deſign, but of mouldering Stone, thro' the Deceit of the Architect. It conſiſts of four <hi>Dorick</hi> Columns, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the four Roads, with a gilded Globe and Croſs at-top, upon a Sun-dial. On two Sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the four <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Pillars, which compoſe a ſort of Pedeſtal, are theſe Inſcriptions:
<q>

            </p>
            <p>The Inſcription on the other Side runs thus:
<q>
                  <hi>Si veterum Romanorum veſtigia quaeras, hic cernas, viator. Hic enim celeberrimae illorum viae mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tares ſeſe mutuo ſecantes ad extremos uſque Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae limites pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

here their moſt celebrated military Ways, croſſing one another, extend to the utmoſt Boundaries of <hi>Britain:</hi> Here the <hi>Vennones</hi> kept their Quarters; and at the Diſtance of one Mile from hence, <hi>Claudius,</hi> a certain Commander of a Cohort, ſeems to have had a Camp towards the <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> ſimply call'd <hi>The Street,</hi> by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> meaſuring from <hi>Cheſter</hi> thro' <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> makes a ſtrait Line with <hi>Rome.</hi> Which ſeems to have been ſo contriv'd by the great Founders, that in travelling upon it they might have the Satisfaction of reflecting, that they were going upon the Line which led to the Capital of the Empire.</p>
            <p>To proceed, we kept the Street-way till we came into the <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Road, which we followed Eaſt to <hi>Hinkley,</hi> a Market-town, ſituate on a Hill very pleaſantly. This Town is noted for a large hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Church, and a high Spire-Steeple all of Stone, in which is a Chime of excellent Bells.</p>
            <p>From hence we turn'd North-weſt, and came to <hi>Nun-Eaton,</hi> an ordinary manufacturing Town, on the River <hi>Anker,</hi> and then Northward to <hi>Atherſton</hi>; and ſo made a kind of ſerpentizing Tour of it along the Borders of the two Counties of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> ſometimes in one and ſometimes in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atherſton</hi> is a Market-town famous for a great Cheeſe-Fair, on the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> from whence the Cheeſe-Factors carry the vaſt Quantities of Cheeſe they buy to <hi>Sturbridge</hi> Fair, which begins about the ſame Time, but holds much longer; and here 'tis ſold again for the Supply of the Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0141100402:385"/>A little North-weſt of <hi>Atherſton</hi> ſtands <hi>Poleſworth,</hi> formerly a Market-town; but ſince the Diſſolution of a famous Nunnery, which was there, the Market was diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Atherſton</hi> we turn'd Eaſt again, into <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> to ſee <hi>Boſworth-field,</hi> famous for the great Battle which put an End to the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> III. and to the long and bloody Contention between the <hi>Red Roſe</hi> and the <hi>White,</hi> or the two Royal Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi>; which, as Fame tells us, had coſt the Lives of 11 Princes, 23 Earls and Dukes, 3000 Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen, and 200,000 of the common People. We view'd the Spot of Ground where the Battle was fought; and at the Town they ſhew'd us ſeveral Pieces of Swords, Heads of Lances, Barbs of Arrows, Pieces of Pole-Axes, and ſuch-like Inſtruments of Death, which they ſaid were found by the Country People in the ſeveral Grounds near the Place of Battle, as they had occaſion to dig, or trench, or plough up the Ground.</p>
            <p>Within three Miles of this Place is an antient Market-town, of the ſame Name, lying on a Hill, in a very healthy and pleaſant Air. The Soil all round it is fruitful, both for Tillage and Paſture.</p>
            <p>Hence I paſs'd directly North to <hi>Aſhby de la Zouch,</hi> on the Skirts of <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> a very pleaſant Town, lying between two Parks. It conſiſts but of one Street, in which ſtands a pretty Stone Croſs; the Church is large and handſome, and 'tis famous for four good Horſe-Fairs in the Year.</p>
            <p>We then paſs'd South-eaſt into <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> has a good old Hunting-ſeat on this Side of the Country, call'd <hi>Bradgate,</hi> and a fine Park at <hi>Grooby</hi>; but they were too much out of our Way: ſo we came on thro' a fine Foreſt to <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leiceſter</hi> is an antient large and populous Town, containing five Pariſhes; 'tis the Capital of the County
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0141100402:386"/>
of that Name, and ſtands on the River <hi>Soar,</hi> which riſes not far from <hi>High-croſs,</hi> juſt mention'd: It is a Borough and Corporation Town, whereof the chief Magiſtrate is a Mayor, who is aſſiſted by a Recorder, Aldermen, and Common-council. Here are three Markets weekly, well ſupply'd with Proviſions. A conſiderable Manufacture is carry'd on here, and in ſeveral of the Market-towns around, for weaving of Stockens by Frames; and one would ſcarce think it poſſible ſo ſmall an Article of Trade could imploy ſuch Multitudes of People as it does; for the whole County ſeems to be buſy'd in it: as alſo <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> of which hereafter.</p>
            <p>The County of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> is in part alſo taken up in Country Buſineſs, more particularly in breeding and feeding Cattle. Moſt of the Gentlemen are Graſiers, and in ſome Places the Graſiers are ſo rich, that they grow Gentlemen; 'tis not an uncommon thing for Graſiers here to rent Farms from 500<hi>l.</hi> to 2000<hi>l.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>The Sheep bred in this County and <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> which joins to it, are, without Compariſon, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and bear not only the greateſt Weight of Fleſh on their Bones, but alſo the greateſt Fleeces of Wool on their Backs, of any Sheep in <hi>England:</hi> and hence it is, that theſe Counties becomes vaſt Magazines of Wool for the reſt of the Nation. Nor is the Wool leſs fine becauſe of the great Quantity; but as 'tis the longeſt <hi>Staple,</hi> as the Clothiers call it, ſo it is the fineſt Wool in the whole Iſland, ſome few Places excepted; ſuch as <hi>Leominſter</hi> in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> the South Downs in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and ſuch little Places, where the Quantity is ſmall and inſignificant, compar'd to this Part of the Country; for the Sheep-breeding Country reaches from the River <hi>Anker,</hi> on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> to the <hi>Humber,</hi> at the fartheſt End of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> which is near 100 Miles in Length; and from the Bank of <hi>Trent,</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0141100402:387"/>
and <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> to the Bank of <hi>Ouſe,</hi> bordering on <hi>Bucks, Bedford, Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon</hi> Shires, above 60 Miles in Breadth.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Funds of Sheep which furniſh the City of <hi>London</hi> with their large Mutton, in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Quantities. There are indeed a few Sheep of a large Breed, which are brought up from <hi>Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Marſh,</hi> and the adjoining low Grounds in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex</hi>; but they are few, and indeed ſcarce worth naming, compar'd to what are produc'd in theſe Counties.</p>
            <p>The Horſes bred, or rather fed here, are the largeſt in <hi>England,</hi> being generally the great black Coach and Dray-horſes; of which ſo great a Number are continually ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> that one would think ſo little a Spot as this of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> could not poſſibly produce ſo many. But the adjoining Counties of <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Bedford</hi> have of late come into the ſame Buſineſs. The chief Supply, however, is from this County, from whence the other Counties rather buy them, and feed them up as Jockeys and Chapmen, than breed them up from their Beginning.</p>
            <p>In the South-weſt Part of the Country riſe four conſiderable Second-rate Rivers, which run every one a directly contrary Courſe in a moſt remarkable Manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Avon,</hi> which runs by <hi>Rugby,</hi> and goes away to <hi>Warwick</hi> South-weſt.</p>
            <p>Of this River the Poet elegantly ſings:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Yet rolling</hi> Avon <hi>ſtill maintains its Stream,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Soar,</hi> which runs by <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and goes away to the <hi>Trent,</hi> North-weſt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0141100402:388"/>3. The <hi>Anker,</hi> which runs by <hi>Nun-Eaton,</hi> and goes away to <hi>Atherſton,</hi> North; and ſo on to <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> Weſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Welland,</hi> which runs by <hi>Harborough,</hi> and goes away to <hi>Stamford,</hi> North-eaſt.</p>
            <p>I ought not to omit obſerving, that as the Town of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was formerly very ſtrong and well fortify'd, being advantageouſly ſituated for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the River covering it half way about, ſo it was again fortify'd in the late unhappy Wars, and being gariſon'd by the Parliament Forces, was aſſaulted by the Royaliſts, who, after an obſtinate Defence, took it Sword in Hand, which occaſion'd a terrible Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They preſerve here a moſt remarkable Piece of Antiquity, being a Piece of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work at the Bottom of a Cellar; 'tis the Story of <hi>Acteon,</hi> and his being kill'd by his own Hounds, wrought as a Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a moſt exquiſite Manner; the Stones are only of two Colours, White, and Brown, and very ſmall.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle here, before it was diſmantled, was a prodigious Building. It was the Court of the great <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who added to it 26 Acres of Ground; which he inclos'd with a very ſtrong Wall of ſquare Stone, 18 Feet high, and called it his <hi>Novum opus,</hi> vulgarly now the <hi>Newark,</hi> where the beſt Houſes in or near <hi>Leiceſter</hi> are, and do ſtill continue extra-parochial. The Hall and Kitchen of this Place remain ſtill intire, as Teſtimonies of the Grandeur of the Whole; the former being ſo lofty and ſpacious, that the Courts of Juſtice, which in Aſſize-time are held there, are at ſuch a Diſtance, as to give no Diſturbance to one another. There are ſeveral Gate-ways to enter this Palace; and that which faces the Eaſt, has an Arch that is deemed a curious Piece of Architecture; over which in the Tower is kept the Magazine for the Militia of the County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:0141100402:389"/>Beneath this Caſtle was a very fair Collegiate Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, in the Church whereof, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his Son the firſt Duke of it, were bury'd; the Hoſpital was built by the Duke in his old Age, and appropriated for the Maintenance of 100 poor People, in which alſo he placed a Dean and twelve Canons, Prebendaries, with as many Vicars and other Miniſters, and ten able Women to ſerve and aſſiſt the Poor and Weak. This, with Divine Service therein, doth in ſome meaſure ſtill ſubſiſt by certain Stipends paid out of the Duchy of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> Another Hoſpital built by Sir <hi>William Wigſton,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. is in a very flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leiceſter</hi> is the <hi>Ratae Coritanorum</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Trace of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall is diſcoverable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Difficulty, eſpecially in the Gardens about <hi>Senvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> with a Ditch, which is very viſible. This was repair'd by <hi>Edelfleda,</hi> a noble <hi>Saxon</hi> Lady, in the Year 914. The old Work call'd <hi>Jewry-wall</hi> is compoſed of Rag-ſtone, and <hi>Roman</hi> Brick.</p>
            <p>Not far off is a Place call'd <hi>Holy-bones,</hi> where abundance of Bones of Oxen have been dug up, which were the Remains of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Leiceſter</hi> many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins are found; a Pot full of them was dug up at the Entrance into <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers.</hi> There are alſo many great Foundations. At St. <hi>Mary de Pree</hi>'s Abbey a Body was dug up, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Since its Diſſolution it has been made a Dwelling-houſe, which has nothing left but the naked Walls, and the Spot of the Abbey is turned into a Garden. The only thing worth ſeeing in it, is a pleaſant Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race-walk, ſupported by an embattled Wall, with Lunets hanging over the River, and ſhaded with Trees.</p>
            <p>In the Time of the <hi>Saxons, St. Margaret</hi>'s Church was an epiſcopal See, and was very fine. Here, ſay ſome, King <hi>Richard</hi> III. was buried.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:0141100402:390"/>Half a Mile Southward from <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> upon the Edge of the Meadows, is a long Ditch, call'd <hi>Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikes</hi>; on the Banks of which, according to Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, King <hi>Charles</hi> I. ſtood to behold the Storm of the Town. That Prince lay at the Vicarage-houſe at <hi>Elſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>South-eaſt of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> lies <hi>Billeſden,</hi> a Market-town of no Note: and further South ſtill, is <hi>Hallaton,</hi> another Town noted for its Poverty, in the midſt of a rich Soil.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Foſſe-way</hi> leads from hence through the North-weſt Part of this County; but entering <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> it inclines North-eaſt, through the Vale of <hi>Belvoir,</hi> or, as it is commonly call'd, of <hi>Bever,</hi> to <hi>Newark.</hi> In all this long Tract, we paſs through a rich and fertile Country, having in our Coaſt North-eaſtward the noble River <hi>Trent,</hi> for twenty Miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, often in our View.</p>
            <p>But ſome Miles North of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> the River <hi>Wrek,</hi> which comes from the North-eaſt, and the <hi>Stour,</hi> which runs North-weſt, form a kind of Y; the <hi>Stour</hi> from <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Southward making the Tail. In the Courſe laſt-mentioned we paſſed through <hi>Montſorrel</hi> and <hi>Loughborough,</hi> both Market-towns, lying on the <hi>Foſſe,</hi> which runs nearly parallel with the <hi>Stour,</hi> and makes one Side of the Y. The firſt is ſituate under a great Eminence, and has a good Stone Bridge over the <hi>Stour</hi>; and the other is ſeated among rich Meadow-ground, and is a fine agreeable Town. And on the <hi>Wrek,</hi> which makes the other Side of the Y, ſtand <hi>Melton Mowbray,</hi> a large well-built conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Market-town, ſituate in a fertile Soil, almoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a little River, call'd the <hi>Eye,</hi> over which it has two fine Bridges; and alſo <hi>Waltham on the Would,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> on the Downs) which is but a mean Market-town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Belvoir-caſtle,</hi> ſtanding within <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> but on the Edge of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> is a truly noble Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0141100402:391"/>
tho' on a very high Precipice; 'tis the antient Seat of the Dukes of <hi>Rutland,</hi> a Family riſen by juſt Degrees to an immenſe Height both of Honour and Wealth. I ſhall mention the Houſe again in my Return out of <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bingham</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> lying in our Way to <hi>Newark,</hi> we paſs'd through it. It is but a ſmall Market-town, but is noted for a Parſonage of great Value.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Newark</hi> one can hardly ſee, without Regret, the Ruins of that famous Caſtle, which through all the civil War in <hi>England,</hi> kept a ſtrong Gariſon for the King to the laſt, and ſo cut off the greateſt Paſs into the North that is in the whole Kingdom; nor was it ever taken, 'till the King, preſs'd by the Calamity of his Affairs, put himſelf into the Hands of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, which lay before it, and then commanded the Governor to deliver it up; after which it was demoliſh'd, that the great Road might lie open and free; and it remains in Rubbiſh to this Day.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle was built here by <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Stephen</hi>; and the Town took its Name from that New Work.</p>
            <p>This Town was certainly rais'd from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Roman</hi> Cities, and has been wall'd about with their Remains. The Northern Gate is compoſed of Stones ſeemingly of a <hi>Roman</hi> Cut: and perhaps they had a Town here; for many Antiquities are found about it. Here are two fine Stone Croſſes. A Gentleman, digging to plant ſome Tree by the <hi>Foſſe</hi> Road Side, diſcover'd four Urns in a ſtrait Line, and at equal Diſtances, in one of which was a braſs <hi>Lar,</hi> or Houſhold-God, an Inch and half long, but much conſum'd by Ruſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newark</hi> is a very handſome well-built Town, ſituate on the <hi>Trent,</hi> under the Government of a Mayor and 12 Aldermen. The Market-place is a
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0141100402:392"/>
noble Square, and the Church is large and ſpacious, with a curious Spire, which, were not <hi>Grantham</hi> ſo near, might paſs for the fineſt and higheſt in all this Part of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Trent</hi> divides itſelf here, and makes an Iſland, and the Bridges lead juſt to the Foot of the Caſtle Wall; ſo that, while this Place was in the Hands of any Party, as I have before hinted, there was no Travelling but by their Leave; but all the Travelling into the North at that Time was by <hi>Nottingham</hi> Bridge.</p>
