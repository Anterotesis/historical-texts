            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EDWARD GIBBON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NO performance is, in my
opinion, more contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible,
than a Dedication of the
common ſort; when ſome great
man is preſented with a book,
which, if Science be the ſubject,
he is incapable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
if polite Literature, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of taſting: and this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb facs="tcp:0438800100:3"/>
is done him, as a reward
for virtues, which he neither
does, nor deſires to, poſſeſs.
I know but two kinds of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which can do honor
either to the patron or author.
The firſt is, when an unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
writer addreſſes himſelf
to a maſter of the art, in which
he endeavours to excel; whoſe
example he is ambitious of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating;
by whoſe advice he has
been directed, or whoſe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
he is anxious to deſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0438800100:4"/>
The other ſort is yet more
honourable. It is dictated by
the heart, and offered to ſome
perſon who is dear to us, becauſe
he ought to be ſo. It is an
opportunity we embrace with
pleaſure of making public thoſe
ſentiments of eſteem, of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
of gratitude, or of all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which we really feel, and
which therefore we deſire ſhould
be known.</p>
            <p>I hope, dear Sir, my paſt
conduct will eaſily lead you
<pb facs="tcp:0438800100:5"/>
to diſcover to what principle
you ſhould attribute this epiſtle,
which, if it ſurprizes, will, I
hope, not diſpleaſe you. If I
am capable of producing any
thing worthy the attention of
the public, it is to you that I
owe it; to that truly paternal
care, which, from the firſt dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of my reaſon, has always
watched over my education, and
afforded me every opportunity
of Improvement. Permit me
here to expreſs my grateful ſenſe
<pb facs="tcp:0438800100:6"/>
of your tenderneſs to me, and to
aſſure you, that the ſtudy of my
whole life ſhall be to acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in ſome meaſure, of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
I can never fully repay.</p>

affection and regard,

            <head>AN
ESSAY
ON THE
Study of Literature.</head>
            <p>I. THE hiſtory of empires is that
of the miſeries of humankind:<note place="margin">Idea of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note>
the hiſtory of the ſciences is that of their
ſplendour and happineſs. If a thouſand
other conſiderations render the ſtudy of
the latter intereſting to the philoſopher,
this reflection alone is ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to every friend of mankind.</p>
            <p>II. How ardently do I wiſh a truth ſo
conſolatory admitted of no exception!
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0438800100:8"/>
But alas! the man too often intrudes on
the retirement of the ſtudent: and hence
even in his cloſet, that aſylum of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative
wiſdom, he is ſtill miſled by his
prejudices, agitated by his paſſions, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed
by his follies.</p>
            <p>The influence of faſhion is founded
on the inconſtancy of man; the cauſes of
its deſpotiſm being as frivolous as the
effects of its tyranny are fatal. Men of
letters are nevertheleſs afraid to caſt off
its yoke, and, tho' reflection cauſes ſome
delay in their ſubmiſſion, it ſerves to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it but the more diſgraceful.</p>
            <p>All ages and countries have given a
preference, not ſeldom unjuſtly, to ſome
particular ſcience, while they permitted
others to languiſh and ſink into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
equally unreaſonable. Thus Logic
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0438800100:9"/>
and Metaphyſics under the ſucceſſors of
Alexander<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This age was that of thoſe philoſophical ſects, who battled for the ſyſtems of their reſpective maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with all the obſtinacy of polemical divines.</p>
                  <p>A fondneſs for ſyſtems neceſſarily produces an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to general principles, and this of courſe brings on a contempt for an attention to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The fondneſs for ſyſtems (ſays Mr. Freret) which poſſeſſed the ſucceſſors of Ariſtotle, made the Greeks abandon the ſtudy of nature, and ſtopped the progreſs of their philoſophical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. Subtlety of argument took place of experiment; the accurate ſciences, Geometry, Aſtronomy, and the true Philoſophy diſappeared almoſt entirely. None gave themſelves the trouble to acquire new principles; but all were employed in ranging, combining, and modelling thoſe, they imagined they knew, into ſyſtems. Hence aroſe ſo many different ſects. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt geniuſes loſt themſelves in the abſtruſeneſs and obſcurity of Metaphyſics, wherein words gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſupplied the place of things; and thus Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic, denominated by Ariſtotle an implement of the underſtanding, became among his followers the principal, and almoſt the ſole, object of their attention. Their whole lives were ſpent in ſtudying the art of reaſoning, without ever reaſoning at all; or at leaſt without reaſoning on any other than trivial and unimportant ſubjects.</q>

Scholaſtic Philoſophy in the thirteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
and the Belles Lettres, till within
the times of our fathers, have all in their
turns ſhared the admiration and contempt
of mankind.</p>
            <p>Natural Philoſophy and the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
are now in poſſeſſion of the throne:
their ſiſter ſciences fall proſtrate before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0438800100:11"/>
them; are ignominiouſly chained to their
car, or otherwiſe ſervilely employed to
adorn their triumph. Perhaps their reign
too is ſhort, and their fall approaching.</p>
            <p>It would be a taſk worthy a man of
abilities, to trace that revolution in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
government and manners, that hath
ſucceſſively bewildered, waſted, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
mankind. It were prudent for
him therein not to ſeek hypotheſes, but
much more ſo not to avoid them.</p>
            <p>III. If the Greeks had never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to ſlavery,<note place="margin">Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Belles Lettres.</note> the Romans had been
ſtill barbarians.<note place="margin">The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic taſte for them.</note> Conſtantinople falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſword of Mahomet, the Muſes
were abandoned to fortune, till aſſembled
and patronized by the Medici. This illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
family encouraged Literature. Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
did ſtill more; he cultivated letters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0438800100:12"/>
himſelf, while Homer and Cicero became
familiar to climes unknown to Alexander,
and Nations unconquered by Rome. In
thoſe days it was thought a fine accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
to ſtudy and admire the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<note n="*" place="bottom">By turning over the Latin Bibliotheque of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius, the beſt of mere compilers, we ſhall ſee that in the ſpace of forty years after the invention of printing, almoſt all the Latin authors iſſued from the preſs, ſome of them more than once. It is true, the taſte of the editors was by no means equal to their zeal. The writers of the Auguſtan hiſtory appeared before Livy; and an edition of Aulus-Gellius was given before any body thought of Virgil.</note>; in ours, it is judged more eaſy
and polite to neglect and deſpiſe them.
I am apt to think there is ſome reaſon on
both ſides. The ſoldier then read them in
his tent; the ſtateſman ſtudied them in
his cloſet. Even the fair ſex, uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the empire of the graces, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0438800100:13"/>
willing to reſign ſuperior knowledge to
ours, were ſubject to the contagion; and
every Delia wiſhed to find a Tibullus in
the perſon of her lover. It was from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus
that Elizabeth (a ſovereign whoſe
name is revered in the annals of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
learnt to maintain the rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
againſt another Xerxes. It was in
Aeſchylus<note n="*" place="bottom">Aeſchylus has written a tragedy, wherein he has painted, in the moſt lively colours, the triumph of the Greeks and the conſternation of the Perſians, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that fatal battle.

She permitted him alſo to take a copy of a Greek epigram of her own compoſition; and aſked his opinion concerning ſome paſſages of Lycophron, which ſhe had then in her hands, and from which ſhe intended to tranſlate ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts.</q>

deſpiſe, and the philoſopher will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
blame her. The man of letters, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
cannot fail to cheriſh the memory
of that Princeſs, who not only ſtudied the
Ancients herſelf, but even rewarded their
commentators. It was by her that Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſe
was honoured with marks of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction;
who, tho' he did not deſerve the
admiration in which his cotemporaries held
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0438800100:15"/>
him, was above that contempt thrown
upon him by his ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>IV. This Princeſs,<note place="margin">That taſte carried too far.</note> without doubt, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her regard for ſuch writers too far.
For my part, tho' ſometimes their advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
never their partiſan, I will freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I think them as coarſe in their manners,
as they were minute and trifling in their
works. A pedantic erudition cramping the
efforts of their imagination, they were rather
dull compilers than ingenious Scholiaſts.
The age was juſt enlightened enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the utility of their reſearches, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſenſible, nor poliſhed ſufficiently to
know what advantages they might have
reaped, by the light of Philoſophy.</p>

Rapin and Brumoy informed the
public alſo of the value of thoſe treaſures
it had in its poſſeſſion. One of thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
that have better immortalized the
name of Lewis XIV. than all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious

already begun its reſearches; ſocieties, in

and politeneſs united; in which
we meet with ſo many important diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
and ſometimes, what hardly yields

the commencement of their decline.<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the Belles Lettres.</note> Le

to natural ſuperiority in the ancients; with
prejudice, abuſe and quotations. The
laugh was entirely againſt them; while
the ancients, who were the ſubject of the

            <p>It is the province of Poets and Orators
to paint the beauties of nature. The whole
univerſe ſupplies them with tints: of that
infinite variety, however, which on every
ſide preſents itſelf, the images they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
may be ranged in three claſſes; thoſe
relating to man, to nature, and to art. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0438800100:24"/>
images of the firſt claſs, or thoſe which
compoſe the picture of man, his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anneſs, his paſſions, his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices;
theſe are they which conduct the
writer in the ſureſt path to immortality.
Every time one reads Euripides or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
one diſcovers new beauties. It is
not, however, to the diſpoſition or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their performances, which are in
this reſpect often defective; nor is it to
their delicacy or ſimplicity of ſtile, that
theſe Poets owe their reputation. No,
the heart beholds the picture of itſelf in
their juſt and lively deſcriptions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
it with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Nature, vaſt and extenſive as it is, hath
furniſhed the Poets with but few images.
Confined by the nature of the object,
or the prejudices of mankind, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
of things, they have ſucceeded only
in painting the ſucceſſive variety of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0438800100:25"/>
ſeaſons; a ſea agitated by ſtorms; the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrs,
wafting love and pleaſure on the
breeze, and the like. A few writers of
genius were enow to exhauſt theſe images.</p>
            <p>X. Thoſe of art remained.<note place="margin">Artificial images.</note> By the
images of art I mean all thoſe things,
by which men have embelliſhed, defaced,
or diverſified nature, religion, laws or cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
The Poets have univerſally made
free with all theſe, and it muſt be owned
they were in the right. Their fellow-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
underſtood them with eaſe, and
peruſed them with pleaſure. They were
pleaſed to ſee the genius of their great

their anceſtors reſpectable, on ſubjects they

            <p>Are the battles, however, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by the French Poet, diverſified like
thoſe of the Greek? Are his heroes equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſting? The ſingle combats of the
chiefs, the long converſations held with
the dying, the unexpected rencounters
we meet with; all betray the imperfection
of the military art; but furniſh the Poet
with the means of making us acquainted
with his heroes, and intereſting us in their
good or ill fortune. At preſent, armies
are vaſt machines animated by the breath
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0438800100:28"/>
of their General. The muſe denies her
aſſiſtance in the deſcription of their evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions:

clouds of powder and ſmoke, that conceal
from her ſight alike the coward and the
brave, the private centinel and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander

            <p>XII. The ancient republics of Greece
were ignorant of the firſt principles of good
policy.<note place="margin">In govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The people met in tumultuous
aſſemblies rather to determine than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate.
Their factions were impetuous
and laſting; their inſurrections frequent
and terrible; their moſt peaceful hours full
of diſtruſt, envy and confuſion<note n="*" place="bottom">See Thucydides, book iii. alſo Diodorus Siculus, from the xith book to the xxth, almoſt throughout. Alſo the Preface of the Abbé Teraſſon to the 3d vol. of his tranſlation of Diodorus Siculus—Alſo Hume's Political Eſſays.</note>: The ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
were indeed unhappy; but their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0438800100:29"/>
writers, whoſe imaginations were warmed
by ſuch dreadful objects, deſcribed them
naturally as they were felt. A peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

inſtitutions, which, projected in the
cabinet of a Sovereign or his council, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

only the Poet's admiration, the coldeſt of
all the paſſions.</p>
            <p>XIII. The ancient mythology,<note place="margin">In reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> which
attributed life and intelligence to all nature,
extended its influence to the pen of the
Poet. Inſpired by the muſe, he ſung the
attributes, the adventures and misfortunes
of his fabulous deities. That Infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which religion and philoſophy have
made known to us, is above ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
the ſublimeſt flights become puerile
on ſuch a ſubject. The almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> of
Moſes ſtrikes us with admiration<note n="*" place="bottom">See the pieces of Huet and Deſpreaux, in the 3d vol. of the works of the latter.</note>; but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0438800100:30"/>
reaſon cannot comprehend, nor imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
deſcribe, the operations of a deity,
at whoſe command alone millions of
worlds are made to tremble: nor can we
read with any ſatisfactory pleaſure of the
devil, in Milton, warring for two whole
days in heaven againſt the armies of the
Omnipotent<note n="*" place="bottom">The golden compaſſes, with which the Creator, in Milton, meaſures the univerſe, excite ſurprize. Perhaps, however, it is puerile in him; tho' ſuch an image had been truly ſublime in Homer. Our philoſophical ideas of the Deity are injurious to the Poet. The ſame attributes debaſe our Divinity which would have extolled the Jupiter of the Greeks. The ſublime genius of Milton was cramped by the ſyſtem of our religion, and never appeared to ſo great an advantage as when he ſhook it a little off; while on the contrary, Propertius, a cold and inſipid declaimer, owes all his reputation to the agreeable pictures of his Mythology.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0438800100:31"/>
The ancients knew their advantages, and
profited by them accordingly. Of this
the maſterly performances we ſtill admire
are the beſt proofs.</p>
            <p>XIV. But we,<note place="margin">The means of perceiving their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> who are placed in another
clime, and born in another age, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
at a loſs to ſee thoſe beauties, for want
of being able to place ourſelves in the ſame
point of view with the Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
A circumſtantial knowlege of their
ſituation and manners can only enable us
to do this. The ſuperficial ideas, the poor
information we glean from a commentary,
aſſiſt us only to ſeize the more palpable
and apparent beauties: all the graces, all
the delicacies of their writings eſcape us;
and we are apt to abuſe their contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries
for want of taſte, in laviſhing ſuch
encomiums on thoſe merits we are too ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
to diſcover. An acquaintance with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0438800100:32"/>
antiquity is the only true comment on the
writings of the ancients: but what is ſtill
more neceſſary, is a certain turn of mind,
which is generally the reſult of it; a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
not only making things known,
but familiarizing them to our ideas, and
inducing us to regard them with the eyes
of ancients. The famous example of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault
may ſerve to illuſtrate my meaning.
The rudeneſs of the heroic ages ſhocked
the delicacy of the Pariſian. It was in vain
that Boileau remonſtrated to him, that
Homer deſigned and ought to deſcribe
Greeks and not Frenchmen: his judgment
was convinced it was right, but he could
not be perſuaded to be pleaſed<note n="*" place="bottom">See Deſpreaux's remarks on Longinus.</note>. A ſmall
portion of antique taſte, if I may ſo call
it, would have done more than all the
reaſonings of his antagoniſt.</p>

XV. I have ſaid that the Poets were
in the right to make uſe of artificial ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;<note place="margin">Artificial images depend on love of fame.</note>
but I know not whether at the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of fame it will be allowed me. We
are all fond of reputation; but nothing is
more different than the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of our paſſion for fame. Every man
has different notions in his deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
One writer, for inſtance, ſeeks
only the praiſe of his contemporaries. Death
puts an end to his hopes and fears of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or applauſe; he cares not, if in the
tomb that encloſes his body be buried alſo
his name. Such a man may, without
ſcruple, employ familiar and temporary
images, in writing for thoſe whom only
he deſires to pleaſe. Another, on the
contrary, bequeaths his name to lateſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mallet's life of Bacon, p. 27.</note>; and pleaſes himſelf in thinking
that a thouſand years after his death, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0438800100:34"/>
Indian on the banks of the Ganges, and
the Laplander on his hills of ſnow, will
read his works, and envy the happy clime
and aera that produced ſo extraordinary a
genius.</p>
            <p>Theſe who are ambitious to pleaſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally,
muſt deduce their images from
the common reſources of mankind, from
the human heart and the repreſentations
of nature. Pride only can induce writers
to exceed theſe bounds. They may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
indeed, that the occult beauties of
their writings will always ſecure a family of
Burmans, to labour in their explication,
and to admire the text the more becauſe
they themſelves have written the comment.</p>
            <p>XVI. It is not,<note place="margin">And on the nature of the ſubject.</note> however, the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the author altogether, but that of
his work, which influences him in this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0438800100:35"/>
particular. The ſublimer ſpecies of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
the epopeia, the tragedy, the ode,
ſeldom employ the ſame images as come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and ſatire; becauſe the former are
chiefly deſcriptive of the paſſions, and the
latter of manners. Horace and Plautus
are almoſt unintelligible to thoſe who have
not learnt to live and think as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
The rival of the latter, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Terence, is better underſtood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has ſacrificed pleaſantry to taſte;
whereas Plautus has even proſtituted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
to mirth. Terence, one is apt to
think, imagined he was deſcribing the
Athenians: his pieces are all over Greek,
excepting the language<note n="*" place="bottom">See Teren. Eunuch. act ii. ſc. 2. Heauton, act i. ſc. 1. The <hi>Cupedinarii</hi> Terence ſpeaks of, diſprove not the truth of this reflection.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0438800100:36"/>
that he wrote for the entertainment of
the Romans; and therefore with him we
find, at Thebes, at Athens, at Calydon,

It is impoſſible to comprehend the

of Virgil, without a perfect knowlege of

Nothing could be more ſtriking, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting

it muſt be confeſſed, was flat enough.
The flight of a band of refugees; their
ſquabbles with a few villagers, and the
ſettling of a paltry town; theſe were the
boaſted labours, the great exploits of the
pious Aeneas. But the Poet has dignified
them, and in ſo doing has had art enough
to render them intereſting. By an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
too refined not to have eſcaped the
generality of readers, and too excellent to
diſpleaſe the critic, he hath embelliſhed
the rude manners of the heroic ages, but
has done it without diſguiſing them<note n="*" place="bottom">Nothing is more difficult for a writer, educated in ſcenes of luxury, than to deſcribe ſimplicity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanneſs.

The herdſman Latinus, and the quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

over gods and men. Virgil knew how to
reflect all the glory of the Romans on their
Trojan anceſtors. The founder of Rome
eclipſes that of Lavinium. It is a fire that
kindles, and preſently blazes over the face
of the earth. Aeneas, if I may ſo venture
to expreſs myſelf, contained the germe of
all his deſcendants. When beſieged in
his camp, he naturally calls to mind a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0438800100:41"/>
Caeſar and an Alexis. We cannot divide
our admiration between them.</p>
            <p>But Virgil never diſplayed greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
than when, deſcended with his hero,
to the ſhades, his imagination ſeemed at
full liberty. Yet here he neither created
new nor imaginary beings. Romulus and
Brutus, Scipio and Caeſar appeared, ſuch
as they had been in life, the admiration or
terrour of Rome.</p>
            <p>XIX. One reads the Georgics with that
lively taſte the beautiful excites,<note place="margin">Of the Georgics.</note> and that
exquiſite pleaſure the charms of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
naturally inſpire, in a ſuſceptible mind.
It is eaſy to conceive, however, that our
admiration would be increaſed, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
in the Poet a deſign equally noble
and elevated, as the execution of it is
highly finiſhed. I conſtantly draw my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0438800100:42"/>
examples from Virgil. His fine verſes,
and the precepts of his friend Horace,
fixed the ſtandard of taſte among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and may ſerve to convey inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the moſt diſtant poſterity. But
to explain my ſentiments more clearly,
it is neceſſary to trace things a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

But it was more neceſſary to inſpire the

            <p>XXIII. Ariſtotle,<note place="margin">Criticiſm. An idea of it.</note> who introduced light
amidſt the obſcurity that clouded the works
both of nature and art, was the father of
criticiſm. Time, whoſe juſtice, ſlow yet
ſure, diſtinguiſhed at length truth from
errour, hath demoliſhed the ſtatues of the
philoſopher, but hath confirmed the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the critic. Deſtitute of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he hath advanced chimeras inſtead
of facts. Formed in the ſchool of Plato,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0438800100:52"/>
and by the writings of Homer, Sophocles,
Euripides and Thucidides, he hath drawn
his rules from the nature of things, and a
knowlege of the human heart; illuſtrating
them by examples from the greateſt models
of antiquity.</p>
            <p>It is now two thouſand years ſince the
days of Ariſtotle. The critics have ſince
improved their art; they are not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as yet agreed concerning the object
of their purſuit. Le Clerc, Couſin, Des-Maiſeaux,
St. Martha<note n="*" place="bottom">Clerici ars critica, lib. i. c. 1.</note>, have all defined
it differently. For my part, I think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them too partial or too poſitive.
Criticiſm is, in my opinion, the art of
forming a judgment of writings and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
of what they have ſaid; of what they
have ſaid well, and what they have ſaid
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0438800100:53"/>
truly<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtorically ſo; the truth of their evidence, not of their opinions; the latter is in the province of logic rather than of criticiſm.</note>. Under the firſt head are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
grammar, a knowledge of langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and manuſcripts; a capacity of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
ſuppoſed from genuine perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and of reſtoring the true reading
of corrupted paſſages. Under the ſecond,
is included the whole theory of elocution
and poeſy. The third opens an immenſe
field, the enquiry into the circumſtances
and truth of facts. Thus the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of critics may be diſtinguiſhed
under three kinds, grammarians, rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
and hiſtorians. The excluſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
of the firſt have not only been
prejudicial to their own endeavours, but
to thoſe of their whole fraternity.</p>
            <p>

XXIV. All that relates to what men
are,<note place="margin">Materials of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm.</note> or have been; all that creative genius
hath invented; that the underſtanding
hath conſidered; together with all which
induſtry hath collected, are included in the
department of criticiſm. A clear head, a
fine taſte, acute penetration, are all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to form a good critic. Follow the
man of letters into his ſtudy, you will ſee
him ſurrounded by the literary produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all ages; his library is ſtocked
with them; and his mind informed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being overburthened by their peruſal.
He looks about him on all ſides; nor is
the author, whoſe writings may have the
moſt diſtant relation to the ſubject of his
thoughts, forgotten: he may happen to
meet there with ſome accidental and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſage, to confirm the diſcoveries of
the critic, or ſtagger his hypotheſes. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0438800100:55"/>
here ends the buſineſs of the ſcholar. The
ſuperficial reader looks no farther, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
the reading and memory of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator;
who is not leſs the dupe of the
encomium, and miſtakes the materials of
building for the edifice itſelf.</p>
            <p>XXV. But the true critic is ſenſible his
taſk is only begun.<note place="margin">The taſk of a critic.</note> He deliberates, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares,
heſitates, and decides. Impartial as
exact, he ſubmits only to reaſon, or to
authority<note n="*" place="bottom">That is to ſay, authority combined with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note>, which is reaſon with regard
to facts. The moſt reſpectable names yield
ſometimes to the teſtimony of writers, who
owe all their weight to momentary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
The true critic, ready and
fertile in reſources, but void of falſe refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſcruples not to ſacrifice the moſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0438800100:56"/>
brilliant, the moſt ſpecious hypotheſes to
truth, nor preſumes to talk to his maſters
in the language of mere conjecture. A
profeſſed advocate for the truth, he ſeeks
that kind of proof his ſubject admits of,
and is ſatisfied. He employs not the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
ſcythe of analyſis, in gathering thoſe
delicate flowers that ſhrink and fade at the
leaſt ungentle touch. At the ſame time,
as little content with inſipid admiration,
he ſearches into the moſt ſecret emotions
of the human heart, to diſcover the cauſes
of his pleaſure or diſguſt. Diffident and
ſenſible, he deals not out conjectures as
truths, reaſonings for facts, or probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for demonſtrations.</p>
            <p>XXVI. Geometry has been called a good
ſpecies of logic,<note place="margin">Criticiſm good lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic.</note> which has been thought
alſo a great encomium on that ſcience:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0438800100:57"/>
as it is certainly more noble to diſplay and
improve the faculties of the human mind
than to trace the limits of the material
univerſe. But has not criticiſm alſo the
ſame pretenſions to logic? It has more:
Geometry is employed only in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
peculiar to itſelf: criticiſm delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
between the different degrees of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.

have given us very falſe ideas of the extent

we ſhall deduce, from the politics of
the Romans, a definition of the term Ally,
very different from what we ſhould lay
down at preſent. Rome, altho' the laſt

uſe of this ſuperiority with a diſcretion

knew well that cities ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

waſte the treaſures, and corrupt the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

ſpecious name, therefore, of allies, they
reconciled the vanquiſhed to the yoke of
ſubmiſſion; while the latter conſented with
pleaſure to acknowlege Rome as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
of the Latin nation, and to furniſh it
with a quota of troops in its wars. The
republic, in return, afforded them only
bare protection, the mark of that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
which coſt its vaſſals ſo dear.
Theſe people were indeed denominated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

no better than her ſlaves.</p>
            <p>XXXI. This explication, it may be
ſaid, diminiſhes the difficulty, but does
not remove it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

we have only a tranſlation of this treaty;
and though we ſhould conditionally admit
the copieſts to be depended on, as to the
main ſubſtance and tenour of it, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
ought not to be ſtrictly taken

of our ideas is ſo extremely arbitrary,
their various ſhades ſo indiſtinct, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
ſo different and changeable, that
the moſt able tranſlator may long look
for equivalent expreſſions, and find at laſt
none but what are barely ſimilar. The
language of this treaty was antique. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius
truſted to the Roman antiquaries;
whoſe vanity was apt to magnify their
ſubject. <hi>Foederati,</hi> ſaid they, does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0438800100:65"/>
XXXII. Again,<note place="margin">Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</note> the Roman marine is
an object of no little embarraſſment to the
critics. Polybius himſelf however aſſures
us, that the fleet of Duillius<note n="*" place="bottom">Polybius, lib. i. c. 20.</note> was their firſt
eſſay of this kind. Polybius therefore muſt
be in one caſe or the other miſtaken, ſince
he contradicts himſelf; which is all the
concluſion I ſhall draw from the matter.
But even admitting the truth of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Roman hiſtory does not therefore
fall to the ground. The following hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
affords a probable ſolution of this
paradox; and that is as much as can be
reaſonably expected of an hypotheſis. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin
oppreſſed both his ſubjects and the
army. He ſeized, and appropriated to
himſelf, their plunder; which gave them
a diſguſt to military expeditions. They
fitted out, therefore, ſmall ſloops, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0438800100:66"/>
went to cruize at ſea. The infant repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
protected them, but, by this treaty,
laid a reſtraint on their depredations.
The continual wars, in which it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
engaged, and wherein the land
forces were well paid, made this marine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected;
and, in an age or two, it was even

may have only ſpoken in too indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
and general terms.</p>
            <p>XXXIII. It may be further remarked,
that this firſt marine of the Romans could
be compoſed only of veſſels of no more
than fifty oars. Galen and Hiero conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much larger ſhips<note n="†" place="bottom">Arbuthnot's Tables, p. 225. Hiſtoire du com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce des anciens, par Huet, c. 221.</note>. The Greeks and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0438800100:67"/>
Carthaginians followed the example; and,
in the firſt Punic war, the Romans fitted
out veſſels of three or four tier of oars, a
circumſtance that aſtoniſhes the antiquaries
and mechanics to this day. So different
an armament was ſufficient to make them
forget their former rude eſſays<note n="*" place="bottom">The celebrated Mr. Freret has offered a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hypotheſis, agreeable enough for its ſimplicity; but it appears to me, not quite ſo reaſonable.

            <p>XXXIV. I have with pleaſure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the defence of an uſeful and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting
hiſtory.<note place="margin">Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on this diſpute.</note> My principal view, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
is to ſhew by theſe reflections, the
nicety of critical diſcuſſions, in which,
the buſineſs is not to produce demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but to make a compariſon between
oppoſite probabilities; as alſo to ſhew how
little confidence ought to be placed in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0438800100:68"/>
moſt ſpecious and dazzling ſyſtems, ſince
there are ſo few that can bear a free and
attentive examination.</p>
            <p>XXXV. A further conſideration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
criticiſm in a new difficulty.<note place="margin">Criticiſm, tho' prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by rote.</note> There
are ſome ſciences which are purely theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical:
their principles conſiſting only of
ſpeculative truths, and not of practical
maxims. It is more eaſy barely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a propoſition, than to render it
familiar to one's thoughts, to apply it with
propriety, to make uſe of it as a guide to
our ſtudies, or as a light to ſhew us the
way to new diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>The art of criticiſm is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by rote or practice. Its elements
are juſt, but of themſelves dry and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
The writer who knows theſe only
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0438800100:69"/>
is equally miſtaken, whether he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
to follow, or ventures to forſake
them. A great genius, fertile of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
maſter of critical rules, and at the
ſame time, of the reaſons on which thoſe
rules are founded, will often appear to
hold them very cheap. New and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
in his attempts, he will ſeem to
have thrown off their reſtraint: but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to the end, and you will always
find him an admirer, tho' not an implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,
of thoſe rules; and that he always
makes them the baſis of his inveſtigations
and diſcoveries. Would the ſciences were
all <hi>legum non hominum reſpublica,</hi> ſuch
would be the wiſh of a learned and wiſe
nation. The accompliſhment of that wiſh
would alſo conſtitute its felicity: but it is
too well known that the happineſs of a
people, and the glory of thoſe who inſtruct,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0438800100:70"/>
or govern them, are different, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
contrary, objects. Our literary cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
apply themſelves only to ſtudies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the ſpear of Achilles, adapted to
the arm and ſtrength of heroes. Shall we
try a little how we can manage it?</p>
            <p>XXXVI. A legiſlator in criticiſm has
pronounced, that the Poet ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
his heroes ſuch as we find them
in hiſtory.</p>

him of that grand reſource, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of the power of contraſting his
characters, and of placing them in thoſe
critical and unexpected ſituations, in which
we admire the hero, or tremble for the
man? Or ſhall we not rather, attached to
beauties more than rules, be more ready
to pardon a writer's anachroniſms than his
dullneſs?</p>
            <p>XXXVII. To charm, to move, to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the ſoul, are the great objects of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Its particular laws, therefore, ſhould
never make us forget they were framed to
aid, and not embarraſs, the efforts of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.
We have ſeen Philoſophy ſo envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with demonſtrations, as hardly to
admit the moſt obvious of received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
theſe, however, are the peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Poetry. We are pleaſed at tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0438800100:72"/>
a review of the heroes and events of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:
when they are traveſtied in the
repreſentation, we are ſtruck with ſurprize;
but it is a ſurprize that revolts againſt the
innovation. If a writer has a mind to
riſque any thing new, he ſhould reflect
whether the beauties of the alteration, or
novelty, be ſtriking or trivial; whether
they will compenſate for that violation of
the rules, which they only can juſtify.</p>
            <p>The anachroniſms of Ovid greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
us<note n="*" place="bottom">In matters of geography and chronology no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is to be made on Ovid; that Poet being groſsly ignorant in both theſe ſciences. Read the deſcription of the voyages of Medea; Metamorph. lib. vii. v. 350 to 402, and the xivth book of the ſame Metamorph. The one paſſage abounds with geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical errours, that offend even the commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and the other is full of chronological blunders.</note>; as truth is violated without
embelliſhment. How different is that of

can be ſo cold and inſenſible, as to attend

ſees Aeneas, the miniſter of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,

nations, dart the thunder of his rage on
the head of the guilty tyrant, but melt
with pity over the unfortunate victim of
his reſentment, the youthful and pious
Lauſus, worthy another father and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fate? Had the Poet been confined to
hiſtorical truth, how many beauties had
he not loſt! Encouraged by this ſucceſs,
however, he wanders from it when he
ſhould have purſued it. Aeneas arrives
at the long-wiſhed-for ſhores of Italy;
the Latins run together to defend their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0438800100:74"/>
habitations, and every thing denounces a
dreadful and bloody combat.</p>

            </q>
            <p>At hearing the name of Aeneas, however,
his enemies threw down their arms. They
were afraid to encounter a warriour, whoſe
glory took its riſe from the aſhes of his
country. They ran, with open arms, to
embrace a Prince, whoſe coming the oracles
had foretold; who brought with him from
Aſia, his gods, a race of heroes, and a
promiſe of univerſal empire. Latinus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him an aſylum, and his daughter<note n="†" place="bottom">Livy, lib. i. c. 1.</note>.
What a ſubject this for the drama!
How worthy the majeſty of the Epopeia
and the pen of Virgil! Let any one, who
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0438800100:75"/>
will venture, compare this with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy
of Ilioneus, the deſcription of the
palace of Latinus, and the diſcourſe of
that Monarch<note n="*" place="bottom">Virg. Aeneid. lib. viii. v. 148.</note>.</p>
            <p>XXXVIII. The Poet,<note place="margin">Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> I ſay again,
may ſafely venture to depart from truth,
provided the reader finds in his fiction,
the ſame pleaſure which truth and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
would give him. Not that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſubvert the annals of an age for
the ſake of introducing an antitheſis. Nor
will this rule, I am perſuaded, be thought
ſevere upon the rights of invention, if we
reflect that all mankind are poſſeſſed of
ſome degree of ſenſibility; but that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
is the portion only of a few. It is
to be obſerved alſo, that beauty of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
operates more powerfully on the ſoul,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0438800100:76"/>
than that of truth on the underſtanding.
The writer, however, ſhould always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that there are ſome liberties which
muſt not be taken. Not even the ſublime
imagination of a Milton, joined to the
harmonious verſification of a Voltaire,
could ever reconcile the reader to a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly

be held ſacred; but Poets, in writing their
hiſtory, may be indulged in giving it us,
rather as it ought to have been, than as it
actually was. Pure invention is leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting
than eſſential alterations, becauſe
the latter ſeems to infer errour, and the
former only ſimple ignorance. It is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
much eaſier to reconcile times than

Great indulgence ought certainly to be
given to the ancients, whoſe chronology
depended, in a great meaſure, on the
Poets, who modelled it almoſt as they

                  <p>It may, nevertheleſs, be doubted, whether this epiſode is ſo irreconcileable to chronological truth as has been imagined.

                  <p>Theſe are the expreſſions Virgil has put in the mouth of Jupiter. But our chronologiſts give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no concern to make the Thunderer keep his word. They repreſent the city of Alba as deſtroyed by Tullus Hoſtilius almoſt 500 years after its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and about 100 years after that of Rome<note n="(8)" place="bottom">See les Tables Chronolog. d'Helvicus.</note>. The ſyſtem of Sir Iſaac Newton, however, makes all eaſy. The deſtruction of Troy, placed in the year 904, and followed by an interval of 337 years, brings us down to 567, 60 years after the Palilia, an epoch that agrees much better with the reign of the third ſucceſſor of Romulus<note n="(9)" place="bottom">Newton's Chronology, p. 52, &amp;c.</note>. There is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tradition, preſerved by Plutarch<note n="(10)" place="bottom">See Plutarch. in Numa.</note>, which exactly coincides. The books of Nama were found ann. ante Chr. 181. four hundred years after the death of that King, and the commencement of the reign of Hoſtilius. Numa died then 581 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtian aera. How artful was it in the Poet to lay hold of the time Aeneas arrives at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, to reply to his critics, in the only manner the rapidity of his courſe, and the greatneſs of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would permit him! He makes it appear, that, according to his theory, this rencounter of Dido and Aeneas is not a poetic licence. Virgil is not the only one who hath called in queſtion the vulgar chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of the Latin Kings. I imagine I can trace the ſame ideas in his contemporary Pompeius. That hiſtorian, the rival of Livy and Salluſt<note n="(11)" place="bottom">Flav. Vopiſc. in proem. Aurelian.</note>, attributes the ſame period of duration, 300 years, to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Alba. Had not his univerſal hiſtory been loſt, we ſhould probably have there found particular and circumſtantial proofs of this opinion. As it is, we muſt be ſatisfied with the ſimple expoſition of his abbreviator. "Albam longam condidit quae trecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis annis caput regni fuit<note n="(12)" place="bottom"> Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. lib. xliii. c. 1.</note>." Livy himſelf, that father of Roman hiſtory, who ſometimes ſhews ſo great an attachment to the vulgar chronology, but generally runs over the difficult paſſages in a manner that betrays his credulity and ignorance, ſeems to diſtruſt his guides in thoſe early ages<note n="(13)" place="bottom">Tit. Liv. lib. i. c. 18. and elſewhere.</note>. Nothing was more natural than for him to take notice how long thoſe Kings reigned, whom he mentions<note n="(14)" place="bottom">Livy, lib. i. c. 9.</note>. Yet is he entirely ſilent on this head. Nothing was more neceſſary than to aſcertain, at leaſt, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between Aeneas and Romulus; which he has not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding neglected. Nor is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s all. "The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Alba, he ſays, happened 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was founded<note n="(15)" place="bottom">Idem. lib. i. c. 29.</note>." In retrenching an 100 years for the reigns of Romulus and of Numa, and for the half of that of Hoſtilius, there remain juſt 300, inſtead of 400, as is given by the chronology of Eratoſthenes. Livy therefore nearly agrees with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, the little difference between them ſerving rather to confirm than diſſolve their agreement.—I foreſee an objection, but as it is one of the moſt trivial, to reply to it would be only to form monſters for the ſake of ſubduing them: I ſhall therefore finiſh this digreſſion, already too long.</p>

of antiquity preſents both to the one
and the other, a plentiful harveſt of facts,
proper to diſplay the ſecrets of nature, or
at leaſt to prevent thoſe, who make them
their ſtudy, from embracing a cloud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Goddeſs. What information
may not a phyſician draw from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the plague that depopulated

            <p>I know the ancients applied themſelves

The conſtruction of palaces, in which

            <p>Thoſe ſpectacles, nevertheleſs, ſo ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all employed to find out creatures remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

to bring them into the amphitheatre at
Rome, and there to make a diſplay of the
whole animal<note n="*" place="bottom">See Eſſais de Mont. vol. iii. p. 140.</note>. This muſt certainly be
an admirable ſchool, particularly for the
ſtudy of that nobleſt branch of natural
hiſtory, which applies itſelf rather to the
nature and properties of animals, than to
the minute deſcription of their bones and
muſcles. We muſt not forget that Pliny
frequented this ſchool, nor that ignorance

of the known world are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
than the material one, while thoſe of
the enlightened world are ſtill more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and contracted. From the times
of its Plinys and Ptolemys, Europe
has been, as at this day, the ſeat of the
ſciences: but Greece, Aſia, Syria, Aegypt,
Africa, countries fruitful in the wonders
of nature, then abounded with Philoſophers
worthy to regard them. All that vaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of men were united by peace, by the
laws, and by a common language. The
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0438800100:90"/>

will admit that a nice Judgment muſt
embarraſs the operations of genius: but
he will, notwithſtanding, conſtantly aſſure
you, that the philoſophical ſpirit, which
breathes throughout his writings, is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical
of the preſent age. The phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
turn and talents of a few great
men, have, according to him, formed the
genius of the age. This influence has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
itſelf over all the different ranks
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0438800100:94"/>
in the ſtate, and has trained up ſcholars
worthy of ſuch eminent maſters.</p>
            <p>XLV. If we take a ſurvey,<note place="margin">What it is not.</note> however,
of the works of our Philoſophers, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
will leave us in great doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of this talent; and this may
not unreaſonably lead us to doubt alſo,
whether it has fallen to their lot. With
ſome it conſiſts in a humour for ſtriking
out into ſome new path, and for explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every eſtabliſhed opinion, whether that
of a Socrates, or a Spaniſh inquiſitor, for
no other reaſon than becauſe it is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
With others again, it is the ſame
thing as a talent for Geometry, that haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and imperious ſcience, which, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with abſolute ſovereignty itſelf, hath
proſcribed its ſiſter ſciences, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
all reaſoning unworthy that name,
whoſe object is not confined to lines and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0438800100:95"/>
figures. Let us do juſtice, however, to
that enterprizing ſpirit, whoſe errours have
ſometimes led the way to truth, and whoſe
very extravagancies, like the rebellion of
a people, have inſpired a ſalutary indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt arbitrary power. Let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege
every thing we owe to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics:
but let us at preſent attend to
the genius of philoſophy, an object more
judicious than the former, and leſs confined
than the latter.</p>
            <p>XLVI. Thoſe who are intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the writings of Cicero,<note place="margin">What it is.</note> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,
Bacon, Leibnitz, Bayle, Fontenelle,
and Monteſquieu, will be able to form a
more juſt and adequate idea of this talent
than what I ſhall attempt to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>A philoſophical genius conſiſts in the
capacity of recurring to the moſt ſimple
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0438800100:96"/>
ideas; in diſcovering and combining the
firſt principles of things. The poſſeſſor of
this diſtinguiſhing faculty has a view as
piercing as extenſive. Situated on an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
he takes in a wide extenſive field,
of which he forms a preciſe and exact idea;
while a genius of an inferiour caſt, tho'
what he ſees he diſtinguiſhes with equal
preciſion, is more contracted in his views,
and diſcovers only a part of the whole.
A philoſopher may be a mathematician, a
muſician, an antiquary; but in every thing
he is ſtill the philoſopher; and, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of his abilities, to comprehend the
firſt principles of his art, he riſes ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to every other artiſt. Placed among
that ſmall number of geniuſes, formed for
ſo arduous a taſk, he labours to compleat
that elementary ſcience, to which, if once
brought to perfection, every other muſt
ſubmit. Taken in this ſenſe, a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0438800100:97"/>
genius is very uncommon. There
are many men capable of forming particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ideas with preciſion; but there are few
who can comprehend, in one abſtract idea,
a numerous aſſociation of others, leſs ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>XLVII. Will it be aſked,<note place="margin">The aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it may gain from lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature.</note> What ſtudy
can form ſuch a genius? I know of none.
It is the gift of heaven, which the greater
part of mankind are ignorant of, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe;
it is the wiſh of the wiſe; ſome have
received, but not one has acquired, it: I
conceive, however, that the Study of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature,
the habit of becoming by turns,
a Greek, a Roman, the diſciple of Zeno
and of Epicurus, is extremely proper to
exerciſe its powers and diſplay its merit.
It is remarkable, that, throughout that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
diverſity of geniuſes, there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
conformity of ſentiment between
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0438800100:98"/>
thoſe whom their age, country and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
have led to take a view of the ſame
objects, in nearly the ſame manner. We
ſee that minds, the moſt exempt from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
cannot altogether ſhake it off.
Their ideas have an air of paradox; and
we perceive even by their broken chains,
that they have worn them. It is among
the Greeks that I look for the abettors
of democracy; among the Romans, the
enthuſiaſts to the love of their country;
among the ſubjects of Commodus, Severus
and Caracalla, for the apologiſts for arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power; and among the ancient fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Epicurus, the enemies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of their country<note n="*" place="bottom">Epicurus had no ſooner publiſhed his doctrines, than ſome people expreſſed themſelves freely on the eſtabliſhed religion, and began to regard it only as a political inſtitution.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0438800100:99"/>
is it to a genius truly philoſophical,
to ſee the moſt abſurd opinions received
among the moſt enlightened people; to
ſee barbarians, on the other hand, arrive
at the knowlege of the moſt ſublime truths;
to find true conſequences falſely deduced
from the moſt erroneous principles; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
principles, bordering on the verge
of truth, without ever conducting thither;
languages formed on ideas, and yet thoſe
ideas corrected by ſuch languages; the
ſprings of morality univerſally the ſame;
the opinions of contentious metaphyſics
univerſally varied, and generally extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
accurate only while ſuperficial, but
ſubtile, obſcure and uncertain whenever
they were profound! A philoſophical work
written by an Iroquois, tho' full of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
would be to us an ineſtimable
performance. It would preſent us with a

mind, placed in circumſtances we have

from ours. Sometimes it would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and inſtruct us, by the contrariety
of ideas, that would thence neceſſarily
ariſe; we ſhould be led to enquire into the
reaſons, and trace the mind from errour
to errour: Sometimes, again, we ſhould
ſee our own principles, but deduced by
different means, and almoſt always pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
modified and altered. We ſhould
hence learn, not only to acknowlege, but
to feel the force of prejudice; we ſhould
learn never to be ſurprized at apparent
abſurdity, and often to ſuſpect the truth of
what might appear to want no confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I muſt own, I like to ſee the reaſonings
of mankind take a tincture from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0438800100:101"/>
to take a view of ſuch as are
afraid to deduce, even from principles they
acknowlege to be juſt, concluſions which
they know to be logically exact. I like
to detect thoſe who deteſt in a barbarian
what they admire in a Greek, and who
would call the ſame hiſtory impious if
written by an heathen, and ſacred if pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>Without a philoſophical knowlege of

We ſhould every moment be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the incredible and the abſurd. The
Romans were an enlightened people; and
yet theſe very Romans were not ſhocked at

God, a prieſt, and an atheiſt<note n="*" place="bottom">If not in denying the exiſtence, at leaſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing the providence, of the Deity; for Caeſar was a follower of Epicurus. Thoſe who have a mind to ſee how obſcure a man of abilities may render the cleareſt truths, will peruſe with pleaſure the doubts with which Mr. Bayle has perplexed the ſentiments of Caeſar. See Bayle's Dict. Art. CAESAR.</note>. He ſaw
temples erected, to his clemency<note n="†" place="bottom">Mem. de l'Acad. des Bell. Lett. tom. i. p. 369. &amp;c.</note>, and

                  <p>Lucretius, born with that enthuſiaſm of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which forms great Poets and enterprizing miſſionaries, was deſirous of being both the one and the other. I muſt pity the theologue, however, who cannot grant ſome indulgence to the latter, for the ſake of the former. This philoſopher, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved a Divinity in ſpite of himſelf, by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the phenomena of nature to general cauſes, proceeds to enquire, how the notion he controverts came to be ſo univerſally entertained. For this he diſcovers three reaſons: I. Our dreams; for in theſe we conceive beings and effects that we never meet with in the material world, and attribute to them a real exiſtence and immenſe power. II. Our ignorance of the works of nature, which makes us, on every occaſion, recur to the hand of a Divinity. III. Our fear, which is the effect of that ignorance: this induces us to ſubmit to the calamities which happen to the earth, and excites us to endeavour to appeaſe, by our prayers, ſome inviſible being that is ſuppoſed to afflict us. Lucretius expreſſes this laſt motive with an energy and a rapidity of ſtile which bears all before it, and will not give the reader time to examine its validity.</p>

partial concluſion, whereby the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
may be enabled to judge of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of an action, or ſome peculiar fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in a character: theſe relate only to
ſingle links of the chain. Thoſe whoſe
influence extends throughout the whole

is ſtill more rarely to be met with is, a
genius who knows how to diſtinguiſh
them, amidſt the vaſt chaos of events
wherein they are jumbled, and deduce
them, pure and unmixt, from the reſt.</p>
            <p>It will appear unneceſſary to obſerve to
thoſe, whoſe judgment is ſuperiour to their

wrong to trace the character of an age,

from the conduct of an individual; or to
eſtimate from a ſingle effort, often forced
and deſtructive, the ſtrength and riches of
a ſtate. It will be needleſs to put ſuch in
mind, that, it is only by collecting and
comparing facts any judgment is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from them; that a ſignal action may
ſometimes dazzle like a flaſh of lightening,
but that we ſhall be able to gather little
from it, unleſs we compare it with others
of the ſame kind. The Romans, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſuch as one may diſcover in conſequence

are alſo often more worthy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

exactly the ſame thing with an age, or a
nation, as with the individual. Alexander
diſplays his character more in the tent of
Darius<note n="*" place="bottom">Quintus Curtius de Reb. Geſt. Alexandri, lib. iii. c. 32.</note> than in the field of battle. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
as much the ferocity of the Roman
people in their condemnation of an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
criminal, to be torn to pieces in the
amphitheatre, as in their ſtrangling a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
King before the capitol. There is no
preparatory diſguiſe to trivial actions. We
undreſs only when we imagine we are not
ſeen; but the curious will endeavour to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
the moſt ſecret retirement. Should
I undertake to determine, whether virtue
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0438800100:109"/>
prevailed in the character of a certain
age, or people, I ſhould examine into their
actions rather than their diſcourſe. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to condemn them as vicious,<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between virtue and vice.</note> I ſhould
attend rather to their words than their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Virtue is praiſed without being
known; known without being felt; and
felt without being practiſed; but the
caſe is different with vice. We are led to
vice by our paſſions, and defend it by
ſubtlety of reaſoning. There are beſides
bad men in all ages and countries: but, if
the depravation be not too general, even
theſe will ſhew ſome reſpect to the times.
If the age itſelf is vicious, (and they are
apt enough to diſcern this) they hold it in
contempt, ſhew themſelves openly what
they are, and laugh at penalties, which
they flatter themſelves will fall but lightly.
In this alſo they are never deceived. The
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0438800100:110"/>
man who, in the time of Cato, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
vice, would have contented himſelf

pitch. This I learn from the court of
Tiberius itſelf; but there is a ſmall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
related by Suetonius and Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
which gives me a ſtill greater aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it. It is this. The virtue of the
Romans puniſhed the inconſtancy of their
wives with death<note n="*" place="bottom">The Romans entruſted the fidelity of their wives to the care and determination of their family. The relations met, if any one was accuſed, judged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, and executed their own ſentence on the criminal. The laws alſo pardoned the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or father, who, in the tranſport of his paſſion, killed the gallant, particularly if of a ſervile rank. See Plut. in Rom.—Dionyſ. Halicarn. lib. vii.—Tac. Ann. lib. xiii.—Valer. Max. lib. vi. c. 3—7. Roſin. Antiq. Roma. lib. viii. p. 859, &amp;c.</note>. Their policy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

the debaucheries of their courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The diſcourſe of Micio in Terence, the manner in which Cicero excuſes the debaucheries of his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the exhortation of Cato ſufficiently explain the morals of the Romans in this reſpect. They cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured debauchery only ſo far as it prevented the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the eſſential duties of the citizen.</p>
                  <p>Nor were their ears more chaſte than their actions. The Caſina of Plautus is little known; but thoſe who have read that miſerable piece, can hardly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how it is poſſible that there ſhould be but forty or fifty years between that farce and the Andria. It conſiſts of a vile intrigue between a parcel of ſlaves, heightened only by ſmutty jeſts and obſcenities, low as their condition. None of Plautus's comedies, however, were played ſo often, nor received with ſo much applauſe, as this wretched performance. Such were the Roman manners at the time of the ſecond Punic war: ſuch that virtue which the poſterity of ancient Rome ſo much regretted and admired. See Terent. Adelph. Act i. ſc. 2.—Cicero pro Caelio, c. 17.—Hor. Sat. lib. i. Sat. 2. v. 29. Prolog. ad Caſin. Piaut.</p>

            <p>LII.<note place="margin">A parallel between Tacitus and Livy.</note> To ſelect thoſe facts, which ought

is a taſk whoſe extreme difficulty is eaſy

at leaſt to be wiſhed that all hiſtorians were
philoſophers.</p>
            <p>Tacitus is the only writer I know that
comes up to my idea of ſuch a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
hiſtorian. Even the intereſting
Livy himſelf cannot, in this ſenſe, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to him. Both indeed have ſoared
far above thoſe ignorant compilers, who
ſee nothing in facts but the circumſtances
of which they are compoſed: but the one
has written hiſtory as a rhetorician, and
the other as a philoſopher. Not that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tacitus was ignorant of the language
of the paſſions, or Livy in that of reaſon;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0438800100:114"/>
but the latter, more earneſt to pleaſe than
inſtruct, conducts us ſtep by ſtep in the
retinue of his heroes, and makes us alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
experience the effects of horrour,
pity, and admiration. Tacitus employs
the force of rhetoric only to diſplay the
connection between the links that form
the chain of hiſtorical events, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the reader by ſenſible and profound
reflections. It is true, I climb the Alps
with Hannibal; but I deliberate in the
council of Tiberius. Livy deſcribes to
me the abuſe of power; a ſeverity that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſhudders at while it approves; the
ſpirit of reſentment and patriotiſm, which
conſtitute that of liberty, and the tyranny
which fell before their united efforts<note n="*" place="bottom">Livy, lib. iii. c. 44.—60.</note>:
but the laws of the decemvir, their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
their failings, their conformity to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0438800100:115"/>
the genius of the Roman people, to their

theſe he has entirely forgotten. I do not

I think ſo, not only from the known

become a philoſophical hiſtory of man.
He would diſplay theſe cauſes operating
in the riſe and fall of empires; ſucceſſively
aſſuming the appearance of accident, of

acting without the concurrence of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

whoſe wants are ſimply thoſe of nature,
that the force of ſentiment ſhould be

Gratitude next united itſelf to admiration.
That oak, which afforded him plenty
of acorns, the clear ſtream, at which he
quenched his thirſt, were his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
they made his life comfortable;
without them he could not ſubſiſt, while

operation of the underſtanding, which acts

Two ſpecies are different in ſome reſpects,

In proportion as mankind become enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,
their idolatry would refine. They
would become better able to perceive how
the univerſe is governed by general laws;
and would approach nearer the unity of
a ſole, efficient cauſe. The Greeks could
never generalize their ideas beyond the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

comprehended and governed all things. But
the Aegyptians, whoſe genius was better

at length to their Oſiris<note n="*" place="bottom">It is worth obſerving, that this Oſiris and his ſiſter were ſaid to be the youngeſt of the deities.

Thus the three principal deities exerciſed
a paternal authority over their children,
diſperſed in the air, over the earth and the

him alſo a ſuperiority over his brothers,
which intitled him to the name of the King

The latter notion might be ſuggeſted to

In the moral world there are many ſuch;
or rather, there are but few, which do not,

more or leſs, partake of both the one
and the other.</p>
            <p>The corruption of all orders of men
among the Romans, was owing to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their empire, and was itſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of the greatneſs of the republic<note n="*" place="bottom">Monteſq. Conſid. ſur la Grandeur des Romains.
I diſtinguiſh the greatneſs of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from that of the republic: the one conſiſted in the number of provinces, the other in that of its citizens.</note>.</p>
            <p>But it requires an uncommon ſhare of
judgment, when two things are conſtantly
united, and ſeem intimately connected, to
diſcern that they are neither effect nor
cauſe to one another.</p>

LXXXII.<note place="margin">The ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do not ariſe from luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> The ſciences, it is ſaid, take
their riſe from luxury; an enlightened
muſt be always a vicious people. For
my part, I cannot be of this opinion.
The ſciences are not the daughters of
luxury, but both the one and the other
owe their birth to induſtry. The arts,
in their rudeſt ſtate, ſatisfied the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
wants of men. In their ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
they ſuggeſt new ones, even from
Vitellius's ſhield of Pallas<note n="*" place="bottom">Vitellius ſent his gal'ies as far as the pillars of Hercules, in order to catch the uncommon and delicate fiſh, of which this luxurious diſh was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.

            <p>Thus have I thrown together a few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,<note place="margin">Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>
which appeared to me juſt and
rational, on the utility of the Belles-Lettres.
Happy ſhould I think myſelf, if, by ſo
doing, I ſhould inſpire a taſte for them
in others. I ſhould entertain too good
an opinion of myſelf, if I did not ſee the
imperfections of this Eſſay; and ſhould
have too bad a one if I did not hope,
at an age leſs premature, and with a more
extenſive knowlege, to be able to correct

them. It may poſſibly be ſaid, theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
are juſt, but hackneyed and trite,
or that they are new, but paradoxical.
Where is the author who loves the critics?
The former imputation, however, will
diſpleaſe me leaſt; the advantage of the
art being more dear to me than the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the artiſt.</p>
