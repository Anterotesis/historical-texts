            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>Progreſs of MANNERS.</head>
               <p>THERE are peculiarities in the appearance, in the expreſſions, in the actions, of ſome perſons, which, in oppoſition to the manners of the generality, are termed their manners. Such peculiarities in the bulk of a nation, by which it differs from other nations, or from itſelf at different periods, are termed the manners of that nation. Manners therefore ſignify a mode of behaviour pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to a certain perſon, or to a certain nation. The term is not applied to mankind in general; except perhaps in contradiſtinction to other beings.</p>
               <p>Manners are diſtinguiſhed from morals; but in what reſpect has not been clearly explained. Do not the ſame actions relate to both? Certainly; but in different reſpects: an action conſidered as right or wrong, belongs to morals; conſidered as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0032300302:6"/>
characteriſtical of a perſon, or of a people, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to manners.</p>
               <p>Manners, peculiar to certain tribes and to certain governments, fall under other branches of this work. The intention of the preſent ſketch is, to trace out the manners of nations, in the different ſtages of their progreſs, from infancy to maturity. I am far from regretting, that manners, produced by climate, by ſoil, and by other permanent cauſes, fall not under my plan: I ſhould indeed make but a poor figure upon a ſubject that has been learnedly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the greateſt genius of the preſent age<note n="a" place="bottom">Monteſquieu.</note>.</p>
               <p>I begin with external appearance, being the firſt thing that draws attention. The human counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance hath a greater variety of expreſſions than that of any other animal; and ſome perſons differ wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the generality in theſe expreſſions. The ſame variety is obſervable in human geſtures; and the ſame peculiarity in particular perſons, ſo as to be known by their manner of walking, or even by ſo ſlight an action as that of putting on or taking off a hat; ſome men are known even by the ſound of their feet. Whole nations are diſtinguiſhable by the ſame peculiarities. And yet there is leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in looks and geſtures, than the different tones of mind would produce, were men left to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of pure nature: man, an imitative animal, is prone to copy others; and by imitation, external behaviour is nearly uniform among thoſe who ſtudy to be agreeable; witneſs people of faſhion in France. I am acquainted with a blind man, who, without moving his feet, is conſtantly balancing from ſide to ſide, excited probably by ſome internal impulſe. Had he been endowed with eye-ſight, he would have imitated the manners of others. I reſt upon theſe outlines: to enter fully into the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0032300302:7"/>
ſubject would be an endleſs work; diſproportioned at any rate to the narrowneſs of my plan.</p>
               <p>Dreſs muſt not be omitted, becauſe it enters into external appearance. Providence hath clothed all animals that are unable to clothe themſelves. Man can clothe himſelf; and he is endowed beſide with an appetite for dreſs, no leſs natural than an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for food. That appetite is proportioned in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to its uſe: in cold climates it is vigorous; in hot climates, extremely faint. Savages muſt go naked till they learn to cover themſelves; and they ſoon learn where covering is neceſſary. The Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians, who go naked in a bitter-cold climate, muſt be woefully ſtupid. And the Picts, a Scotch tribe, who, it is ſaid, continued naked down to the time of Severus, did not probably much ſurpaſs the Patagonians in the talent of invention.</p>
               <p>Modeſty is another cauſe for clothing: few ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages expoſe the whole of the body without cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It gives no high idea of Grecian modeſty, that at the Olympic games people wreſtled and run races ſtark naked.</p>
               <p>There is a third cauſe for clothing, which is, the pleaſure it affords. A fine woman, ſeen naked once in her life, is a deſirable object; deſire being inflamed by novelty. But let her go naked for a month; how much more charming will ſhe appear, when dreſſed with propriety and elegance! Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo eſſential to health, that to be leſs agreeable than nakedneſs would argue an incongruity in our nature. Savages probably at firſt thought of cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a protection only againſt the weather; but they ſoon diſcovered a beauty in dreſs: men led the way, and women followed. Such ſavages as go naked, paint their bodies, excited by the ſame fondneſs for ornament, that our women ſhew in their party-coloured garments. Among the Jews,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0032300302:8"/>
the men wore ear-rings as well as the women<note n="b" place="bottom">Exod. xxii. 2.</note>. When Media was governed by its own kings, the men were ſumptuous in dreſs: they wore looſe robes, floating in the air; had long hair covered with a rich bonnet, bracelets, chains of gold, and precious ſtones: they painted their faces, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed artificial hair with that of nature. As authors are ſilent about the women, they probably made no figure in that kingdom, being ſhut up, as at preſent, in ſeraglios. Very different was the caſe of Athenian ladies, after polygamy was baniſhed from Greece. They conſumed the whole morning at the toilette; employing paint, and every drug for cleaning and whitening the ſkin: they laid red even upon their lips, and took great care of their teeth: their hair, made up in buckles with a hot iron, was perſumed and ſpread upon the ſhoulders: their dreſs was elegant, and artfully contrived to ſet off a fine ſhape. Such is the influence of appetite for dreſs: vanity could not be the ſole motive, as Athenian ladies were never ſeen in public. We learn from St. Gregory, that women in his time dreſſed their heads extremely high; environing them with many treſſes of falſe hair, diſpoſed in knots and buckles, ſo as to reſemble a regular forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Joſephus reports, that the Jewiſh ladies powdered their hair with gold duſt; a faſhion that was carried from Aſia to Rome. The firſt writer who mentions white powder for the hair, the ſame we uſe at preſent, is L'Etoile, in his journal for the year 159<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. He relates, that nuns walked the ſtreets of Paris curled and powdered. That faſhion ſpread by degrees through Europe. For many years after the civil wars in France, it was the faſhion in Paris to wear boots and ſpurs with a long ſword; a gentleman was not in full dreſs without
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0032300302:9"/>
theſe accoutrements. The ſword continues an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of dreſs, tho' it diſtinguiſhes not a gentleman from his valet. To ſhow that a taſte for dreſs and ornament is deeply rooted in human nature, ſavages diſplay that taſte upon the body, having no cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſplay it upon. Seldom is a child left to nature: it is deprived of a teſticle, a finger, a tooth; or its ſkin is engraved with figures.</p>
               <p>Cloathing hath no ſlight influence, even with reſpect to morals. I venture to affirm, at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being thought paradoxical, that nakedneſs is more friendly to chaſtity than covering. Adultery is unknown among ſavages, even in hot climates where they have ſcarce any covering. A woman dreſſed with taſte is a more deſirable object than one who always goes naked. Dreſs, beſide, gives play to the imagination, which pictures to itſelf many ſecret beauties, that vaniſh when rendered familiar by ſight: if a lady accidentally diſcovers half a leg, imagination is inſtantly inflamed, tho' an actreſs appearing in breeches is beheld with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference: a naked Venus makes not ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as when a garter only is diſcovered. In Sparta, men and women lived together without any reſerve: public baths were common to both; and in certain games they danced and combated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naked as when born. In a later period, the Spartan dames were much corrupted; occaſioned, as authors ſay, by a ſhameful freedom of intercourſe between the ſexes. But remark, that corruption was not confined to the female ſex, men having degenerated as much from their original manhood as women from their original chaſtity; and I have no difficulty to maintain, that gold and ſilver, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted contrary to the laws of Lycurgus, were what corrupted both ſexes. Opulence could not fail to have the ſame effect there that it has every where; which is to excite luxury and ſenſuality.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0032300302:10"/>
The Spartans accordingly, ſhaking off auſterity of manners, abandoned themſelves to pleaſure: the moſt expenſive furniture, the ſofteſt beds, ſuperb tapeſtry, precious vaſes, exquiſite wines, delicious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ands, were not now too delicate for an effeminate Spartan, once illuſtrious for every manly virtue. Lycurgus underſtood human nature better than the writers do who carp at him. It was his intention, to make his countrymen ſoldiers, not whining lovers: and he juſtly thought, that familiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the ſexes would confine their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites within the bounds of nature; an uſeful leſſon to women of faſhion in our days, who expoſe their nakedneſs in order to attract and enſlame lovers. What juſtifies this reaſoning is, the aſcendant that Spartan dames had over their huſbands while the laws of Lycurgus were in vigour: they in effect ruled the ſtate as well as their own families. Such aſcendant cannot be obtained nor preſerved but by ſtrict virtue: a woman of looſe manners may be the object of looſe deſire; but ſeldom will ſhe gain an aſcendant over any man, and never over her huſband. Among no people was there more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of intercourſe than among the ancient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: males and females ſlept promiſcuouſly round the walls of their houſes; and yet we never read of an attempt upon a married woman. The ſame holds true of the Scotch highlanders.</p>
               <p>Cleanlineſs is an article in external appearance. Whether it be inherent in the nature of man, or only a refinement of poliſhed nations, may at firſt ſight appear doubtful. What pleads for the former is, that cleanlineſs is remarkable in ſeveral nations that have made little progreſs in the arts of life. The ſavages of the Caribbee iſlands, once a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tribe, were remarked by writers as neat and cleanly. In the iſland Otaheite, or King George's Iſland, both ſexes are cleanly: they bathe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0032300302:11"/>
never eat nor drink without waſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, and their garments as well as their perſons are kept free of ſpot or blemiſh. Ammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Marcellinus, deſcribing the Gauls, ſays, that they were cleanly; and that even the pooreſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were never ſeen with dirty garments. The negroes, particularly thoſe of Ardrah in the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, have a ſcrupulous regard to cleanlineſs. They waſh morning and evening, and perſume themſelves with aromatic herbs. In the city of Benin, in Guinea, women are employ'd to keep the ſtreets clean; and in that reſpect they are not outdone by the Dutch. In Corea, people mourn three years for the death of their parents; during which time they never waſh. Dirtineſs muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear diſmal to that people, as to us<note n="*" place="bottom">Many animals are remarkable for cleanlineſs. Beavers are ſo, and ſo are cats. This muſt be natural. Tho' a taſte for cleanlineſs is not remarkable in dogs, yet, like men, they learn to be cleanly.</note>. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are no leſs numerous that favour the other ſide of the queſtion. Amminianus Marcellinus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the Huns, that they wore the ſame coat till it fell to pieces with dirt and rottenneſs. Plan Carpin, who viſited the Tartars anno 1246, ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That they never waſh face nor hands; that they never clean a diſh, a pot, nor a garment; that, like ſwine, they made food of every thing, not excepting the vermin that crawl on them."</q> The preſent people of Kamſkatka anſwer to that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every article. The naſlineſs of North American ſavages, in their food, in their cabins, and in their garments, paſſes all conception. As they never change their garments till they fall to rags, nor ever think of waſhing them, they are eat up with vermin. The Eſquimaux, and many other tribes, are equally naſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0032300302:12"/>
As cleanneſs requires attention and induſtry, the cleanlineſs of ſome ſavages muſt be the work of nature and the dirtineſs of others muſt proceed from indolence counteracting nature. In fact, cleanlineſs is agreeable to all; and naſtineſs diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable: no perſon prefers dirt; and even thoſe who are the moſt accuſtomed to it, are pleaſed with a cleanly appearance in others. It is true, that a taſte for cleanneſs, like that for order, for ſymmetry, for congruity, is extremely faint during its infancy among ſavages. Its ſtrongeſt antagoniſt is indolence, which ſavages indulge to exceſs: the great fatigue they undergo in hunting makes them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nd of eaſe at home; and dirtineſs, when once habitual, is not eaſily conquered. But cleanlineſs improves gradually with manners, and makes a figure in every induſtrious nation. Nor is a taſte for cleanneſs bellow'd on man in vain: its final cauſe is conſpicuous, cleanneſs being extremely wholeſome, and naſtineſs no leſs unwholeſome<note n="*" place="bottom">The plague, peſtilential ſevers, and other putrid diſeaſes, were more frequent in Europe formerly than at preſent; eſpecially in great cities, where multitudes were crowded together in ſmall houſes, and narrow ſtreets. Paris, in the days of Henry IV. occupied not the third part of its preſent ſpace, and yet contained nearly the ſame number of inhabitants; and in London the houſes are much larger, and the ſtreets wider, than before the great fire, 1666. There is alſo a remarkable alteration in point of diet. Formerly, people of rank lived on ſalt meat the greater part of the year: at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, freſh meat is common all the year round. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs and roots are now a conſiderable article of food: about London, in particular, the conſumption at the Revolution was not the ſixth part of what it is now. Add the great conſumption of tea and ſugar, which I am told by phyſicians to be no inconſiderable antiſeptics. But the chief cauſe of all is cleanlineſs, which is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more univerſal, eſpecially in the city of London. In Conſtantinople, putrid diſeaſes reign as much as ever; not from unhealthineſs in the climate, but from the narrowneſs and naſtineſs of the ſtreets.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0032300302:13"/>
Thus it appears, that a taſte for cleanneſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in our nature. I ſay more: cleanlineſs is evidently a branch of propriety, and conſequently a ſelf-duty. The performance is rewarded with approbation; and the neglect is puniſhed with contempt<note n="c" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, chap. 10.</note>.</p>
               <p>A taſte for cleanneſs is not equally diſtributed among all men; nor indeed is any branch of the moral ſenſe equally diſtributed: and if by nature one perſon be more cleanly than another, a whole nation may be ſo. I judge that to be the caſe of the Japaneſe, ſo finically clean as to find ſault even with the Dutch for dirtineſs. Their inns are not an exception, nor their little houſes, in which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is always at hand for waſhing after the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I judged it to be alſo the caſe of the Engliſh, who, high and low, rich and poor, are remarkable for cleanlineſs all the world over; and I have often amuſed myſelf with ſo ſingular a reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween iſlanders, removed at the greateſt diſtance from each other. But I was forc'd to abandon the reſemblance, upon a diſcovery that the Engliſh have not always been ſo cleanly as at preſent. Many centuries ago, as recorded in monkiſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, one cauſe of the averſion the Engliſh had to the Danes, was their cleanlineſs: they combed their hair, and put on a clean ſhirt once a-week. And the celebrated Eraſmus, who viſited England in the reign of Henry VIII. complains of the naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſlovenly habits of its people; aſcribing to that cauſe the frequent plagues which at that time
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0032300302:14"/>
infeſted them. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Their floors,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"are commonly of clay ſtrewed with ruſhes, under which lies unmoleſted a collection of beer, greaſe, fragments, bones, ſpittle, excrements of dogs and cats, and of every thing that is nauſcous<note n="d" place="bottom">Epiſt. 432.</note>."</q> A change ſo extraordinary in the taſte and manners of the Engliſh, rouſes our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; and I ſlatter myſelf that the following cauſe will be ſatisfactory. A ſavage, remarkably indolent at home, tho' not inſenſible of his dirtineſs, cannot rouſe up activity ſufficient to attempt a ſerious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and would be at a loſs where to begin. The induſtrious, on the contrary, are improved in neatneſs and propriety by the art or manufacture that conſtantly employs them: they are never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to purge the ſtable of Augeas; for being prone to action, they ſuffer not dirt to reſt unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted. Induſtrious nations accordingly, all the world over, are the moſt cleanly. Arts and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had long flouriſhed in Holland, where Eraſmus was born and educated: the people were clean above all their neighbours, becauſe they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious above all their neighbours; and upon that account the dirtineſs of England could not fail to ſtrike a Hollander. At the period mentioned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry was as great a ſtranger to England as clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: from which conſideration, may it not fairly be inferred, that the Engliſh are indebted for their cleanlineſs to the great progreſs of induſtry among them in later times? If this inference holds, it places induſtry in an amiable light. The Spaniards, who are indolent to a degree, are to this day as dirty as the Engliſh were formerly. Madrid, their capital, is nauſeouſly naſty: heaps of unmoleſted dirt in every ſtreet raiſe in that warm climate a peſtiferous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0032300302:15"/>
ſteam, which threatens to knock down every ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. A purgation was lately ſet on foot by royal authority. But people habituated to dirt are not eaſily reclaimed: to promote induſtry is the only effectual remedy<note n="*" place="bottom">Till the year 1760, there was not a privy in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, tho' it is plentifully ſupplied with water. The ordure, during night, was thrown from the windows into the ſtreet, where it was gathered into heaps. By a royal proclamation, privies were ordered to be built. The inhabitants, tho' long accuſtomed to an arbitrary government, reſented this proclamation as an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common rights of mankind, and ſtruggled vigorouſly againſt it. The phyſicians were the moſt violent oppoſers: they remonſtrated, that if the filth was not thrown into the ſtreets, a fatal ſickneſs would enſue; becauſe the putreſcent particles of air, which the filth attracted, would be imbibed by the human body.</note>. The naſtineſs of the ſtreets of Liſbon before the late earthquake was intolerable; and ſo is at preſent the naſtineſs of the ſtreets of Cadiz.</p>
               <p>Tho' induſtry be the chief promoter of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it is ſeldom left to operate alone: other cauſes mix, ſome to accelerate the progreſs, ſome to retard it. The moiſture of the Dutch climate has a conſiderable influence in promoting cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and joined with induſtry produces a ſurpriſing neatneſs and cleanlineſs among people of buſineſs: men of figure and faſhion, who generally reſort to the Hague, the ſeat of government, are not ſo cleanly. On the other hand, the French are leſs cleanly than the Engliſh, tho' not leſs induſtrious. But the lower claſſes of people, being in England more at their eaſe than in France, have a greater taſte for living well, and in particular for keeping themſelves clean.</p>

A beard gives to the countenance a rough and fierce air, ſuited to the manners of a rough and fierce people. The ſame face without a beard appears milder; for which reaſon, a beard becomes unfaſhionable in a poliſhed nation. Demoſthenes the orator lived in the ſame period with Alexander the Great, at which time the Greeks begun to leave off beards A buſt however of that orator, found in Herculaneum, has a beard; which muſt either have been done for him when he was young, or from reluctance in an old man to a new faſhion. Barbers were brought to Rome from Sicily in the 454th year after the building of Rome. And it muſt relate to the time following that period, what Aulus Gellius ſays<note n="e" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 4.</note>, that people accuſed of any crime were prohibited to ſhave their beards till they were abſolved. From Hadrian, downward, the Roman Emperors wore beards. Julius Capitolinus reproaches the Emperor Verus for cutting his beard, at the inſtigation of a concubine. All the Roman generals wore beards in Juſtinian's time<note n="f" place="bottom">Procopii Hiſtoria Vandalica, lib. 2.</note>. When the Pope ſhaved his beard, it was reckoned a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt apoſtaſy by the Greek church; becauſe Moſes and Jeſus Chriſt were always drawn with beards by the Greek and Latin painters. Upon the dawn of ſmooth manners in France, the beaus cut their beards into ſhapes, and curled their whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. That faſhion produced a whimſical effect, viz. that men of gravity left off beards altogether: a beard in its natural ſhape was too fierce, even for them; and they could not for ſhame copy after the beaus.</p>
               <p>Language, when brought to any perfection among a poliſhed people, may juſtly be conſidered as one of the fine arts; and in that view is handled
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0032300302:17"/>
above. But it belongs to the preſent ſketch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a branch of external behaviour. Every part of external behaviour is influenced by temper and diſpoſition, and language more than any other part. In Elements of Criticiſm<note n="g" place="bottom">Chap. 2. part 6.</note> it is obſerved, that an emotion in many inſtances bears a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to its cauſe. The like holds univerſally in all the natural ſounds prompted by paſſion. Let a paſſion be bold, rough, chearful, tender, or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſtill it holds, that the natural ſound prompted by it is in the ſame tone: and hence the reaſon why theſe natural ſounds are the ſame in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. Some ſlight reſemblance of the ſame kind is diſcoverable in many artificial ſounds. The language of a ſavage is harſh; of polite people, ſmooth; and of women, ſoft and muſical. The tongues of ſavage nations abound in gutturals, or in naſals; yet one would imagine that ſuch words, pronounced with difficulty, would be avoided by ſavages, as they are by children. But temper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and ſuggeſts to ſavages harſh ſounds, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their roughneſs and cruelty. The Eſquimaux have a language compoſed of the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gutturals; and the tongues of the northern Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations are not remarkably more ſmooth. The Scotch peaſants are a frank and plain people; and their dialect is in the tone of their character. The Huron tongue hath ſtatelineſs and energy above moſt known languages; and the Hurons ſtill retain a certain elevation of mind, which is more conformable to the majeſty of their diſcourſe, than to their preſent low condition. Thus the manners of a people may in ſome meaſure be gathered from their language. Nay, manners may frequently be gathered from ſingle words. The Hebrew word LECHOM ſignifies both food and fighting; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0032300302:18"/>
TEREPH ſignifies both food and plunder. KARAB ſignifies to draw near to one, and ſignifies alſo to fight. The Greek word LEIA, which ſignified originally, ſpoil procured by war or piracy, came to ſignify wealth. And the great variety of Greek words ſignifying good and better, ſignified originally ſtrong and violent.</p>
               <p>Government, according to its different kinds, hath conſiderable influence in forming the tone of a language. Language in a democracy is commonly rough and coarſe; in a republic, manly and plain; in a monarchy, courteous and inſinuating; in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, imperious with reſpect to inferiors, and humble with reſpect to ſuperiors. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Greek empire is well repreſented in Juſtinian's edicts, termed Novellae Conſtitutiones, the ſtyle of which is ſtiff, formal, and affectedly ſtately; but deſtitute of order, of force, and of ligament. About three centuries ago, Tuſcany was filled with ſmall republics, who ſpoke a dialect manly and plain. Its rough tones were purged off when united under the Great Duke of Tuſcany; by which means the Tuſcan dialect has arrived nearer to perfection than any other in Italy. The tone of the French language is well ſuited to the nature of its government: every man is politely ſubmiſſive to thoſe above him; and this tone forms the character of the language in general, ſo as even to regulate the tone of the few who have occaſion to ſpeak with authority. The freedom of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh government forms the manners of the people: the Engliſh language is accordingly more manly and nervous than the French, and abounds more with rough ſounds. The Lacedemonians of old, ap roud and auſtere people, affected to talk with brevity, in the tone of command more than of advice; and hence the Laconic ſtyle, dry but maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine. The Attic ſtyle is more difficult to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0032300302:19"/>
accounted for: it was ſweet and copious; and had a remarkable delicacy above the ſtyle of any other nation. And yet the democracy of Athens produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced rough manners; witneſs the comedies of Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophanes, and the orations of Eſchines and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes. We are not ſo well acquainted with the Athenians as to account for the difference between their language and their manners: and are equally at a loſs about the Ruſſian tongue, which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the barbarity of the people, is ſmooth and ſonorous. All that can be ſaid is, that the operation of a general cauſe may be diſturbed by particular circumſtances. Languages reſemble the tides: the influence of the moon, which is the general cauſe of tides, is in ſeveral inſtances over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced by particular cauſes acting in oppoſition.</p>
               <p>There may be obſerved in ſome ſavage tribes, a certain refinement of language that might do honour to a poliſhed people. The Canadians never give a man his proper name, in ſpeaking to him. If he be a relation, he is addreſſed to in that quality: if a ſtranger, the ſpeaker gives him ſome appellation that marks affection; ſuch as, brother, couſin, friend.</p>
               <p>From ſpeech we advance to action. Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prone to motion; witneſs children, who are never at reſt but when aſleep. Where reaſon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, a man reſtrains that reſtleſs diſpoſition, and never acts without a motive. Savages have few motives to action when the belly is full: their huts require little induſtry; and their covering of ſkins, ſtill leſs. Hunting and fiſhing employ all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. After much fatigue in hunting, reſt is ſweet; which the ſavage prolongs, having no motive to action till the time of hunting returns. Savages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, like dogs, are extremely active in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0032300302:20"/>
field, and extremely indolent at home<note n="*" place="bottom">

The ſavages of the torrid zone are indolent above all others: they go naked; their huts coſt them no trouble; and they never hunt except for vegetables, which are their only food. The Spaniards who firſt landed in Hiſpaniola, were ſurpriſed at the manners of the inhabitants.

The character given of theſe ſavages belongs to all, eſpecially to ſavages in hot climates.

Not to talk of gold, ſilver was ſcarce in England during the reign of the third Edward. Rents were paid in kind; and what money they had was locked up in the coffers of the great barons. Pieces of plate were bequeathed even by kings of England, ſo trifling in our eſtimation, that a gentleman of a moderate fortune would be aſhamed to mention ſuch in his will.</p>
               <p>We next take under conſideration the progreſs of ſuch manners as are more peculiarly influenced by internal diſpoſition; preparing the reader by a general view, before entering into particulars. Man is by nature a timid animal, having little ability to ſecure himſelf againſt harm: but he becomes bold in ſociety, and gives vent to paſſion againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In the hunter-ſtate, the daily practice of ſlaughtering innocent animals for food, hardens men in cruelty: they are worſe than bears or wolves, being cruel even to their own kind. The calm and ſedentary life of a ſhepherd tends to ſoften the harſh manners of hunters; and agriculture, requiring the union of many hands in one operation, inſpires a taſte for mutual good offices. But here comes in the hoarding appetite to diſturb that auſpicious commencement of civilization. Skilful huſbandry, producing the neceſſaries of life in plenty, paves the way to arts and manufactures. Fine houſes, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did gardens, and rich apparel, are deſirable objects: the appetite for property becomes headſtrong, and to obtain gratification tramples down every obſtacle of juſtice or honour<note n="o" place="bottom">See ſketch 3.</note>. Differences ariſe, foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcord and reſentment: war is raiſed, even among thoſe of the ſame tribe; and while it was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0032300302:23"/>
lawful for a man to take revenge at his own hand<note n="p" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 1.</note>, that fierce paſſion ſwallowed up all others. Inequality of rank and fortune foſtered diſſocial paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: witneſs pride in particular, which produced a cuſtom, once univerſal among barbarians, of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling men, women, dogs, and horſes, for ſerving a dead chieftain in the other world. Such complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſelfiſh and ſtormy paſſions, tending eagerly to gratification, and rendering ſociety uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cannot be ſtemmed by any human means other than wholeſome laws: a momentary obſtacle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames deſire; but perpetual reſtraint deadens even the moſt fervid paſſion. The authority of good government gave vigour to kindly affections; and appetite for ſociety, which acts inceſſantly, though not violently, gave a currency to mutual good offices. A circumſtance concurred to blunt the edge of diſſocial paſſions: the firſt ſocieties were ſmall; and ſmall ſtates in cloſe neighbourhood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce diſcord and reſentment without end: the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many ſuch ſtates into a great kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move people farther from their enemies, and render them more gentle<note n="q" place="bottom">See this more fully handled, book 2. ſketch 1.</note>. In that ſituation, men have leiſure and ſedateneſs to reliſh the comforts of ſocial life: they find that ſelfiſh and turbulent paſſions are ſubverſive of ſociety; and through fondneſs for ſociety, they patiently undergo the ſevere diſcipline of reſtraining paſſion, and ſmoothing manners. Violent paſſions that diſturb the peace of ſociety have ſubſided, and are now ſeldom heard of: hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is in faſhion, and ſocial affections prevail. Men improve in urbanity by converſing with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and however ſelfiſh at heart, they conciliate favour, by aſſuming an air of diſintereſtedneſs. Selfiſhneſs thus refined becomes an effectual cauſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0032300302:24"/>
of civilization. But what follows? Turbulent and violent paſſions are buried, never again to revive; leaving the mind totally ingroſſed by ſelf-intereſt. In the original ſtate of hunters and fiſhers, there being little connection among individuals, every min minds his own concerns, and ſelfiſhneſs governs. The diſcovery that hunting and fiſhing are beſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in company, promotes ſome degree of ſociety in that ſtate: it gains ground in the ſhepherd-ſtate, and makes a capital figure where huſbandry and commerce flouriſh. Private concord is promoted by ſocial affection; and a nation is proſperous in proportion as the amor patriae prevails. But wealth, acquired whether by conqueſt or commerce, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of luxury and ſenſuality. As theſe increaſe, ſocial affections decline, and at laſt vaniſh. This is viſible in every opulent city that has long flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in extenſive commerce. Selfiſhneſs becomes the ruling paſſion: friendſhip is no more; and even blood-relation is little regarded. Every man ſtudies his own intereſt; and love of gain and of ſenſual pleaſure are idols worſhipped by all. And thus in the progreſs of manners, men end as they begun: ſelfiſhneſs is no leſs eminent in the laſt and moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſtate of ſociety, than in the firſt and moſt ſavage ſtate.</p>
               <p>From a general view of the progreſs of manners, we deſcend to particulars. And the firſt ſcene that preſents itſelf is, cruelty to ſtrangers, extended in proceſs of time againſt members of the ſame tribe. Anger and reſentment are predominant in ſavages, who never think of ſmothering paſſion. But this character is not univerſal: ſome tribes are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for humanity, as mentioned in the firſt ſketch. Anger and reſentment formed the character of our European anceſtors, and made them fierce and cruel. The Goths were ſo prone to blood, that in their firſt inroads into the Roman territories they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0032300302:25"/>
maſſacred man, woman, and child. Procopius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that in one of theſe inroads they left Italy thin of inhabitants. They were however an honeſt people; and by the poliſh they received in the civilized parts of Europe, they became no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for humanity, than formerly for cruelty. Totila, their king, having maſtered Rome after a long and bloody ſiege, permitted not a ſingle perſon to be killed in cold blood, nor the chaſtity of any woman to be attempted. One cannot without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror think of the wanton cruelties exerciſed by the Tartars againſt the nations invaded by them under Gengizcan and Timor Bec.</p>
               <p>A Scythian, ſays Herodotus, preſents the king with the heads of the enemies he has killed in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and the man who brings not a head, gets no ſhare of the plunder. He adds, that many Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans clothe themſelves with the ſkins of men, and make uſe of the ſculls of their enemies to drink out of. Diodorus Siculus reports of the Gauls, that they carry home the heads of their enemies ſlain in battle: and after embalming them, depoſit them in cheſts as their chief trophy; bragging of the ſums offered for theſe heads by the friends of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and refuſed. In ſimilar circumſtances men are the ſame all the world over. The ſcalping of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in daily uſe among the North-American ſavages, is equally cruel and barbarous.</p>
               <p>No ſavages are more cruel than the Greeks and Trojans were, as deſcribed by Homer; men butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in cold blood, towns reduced to aſhes, ſovereigns expoſed to the moſt humbling indignities, no reſpect paid to age nor to ſex. The young Adraſtus<note n="r" place="bottom">Book 6. of the Iliad.</note>, thrown from his car, and lying on his face in the duſt, obtained quarter from Menelaus.

Hector, having ſtripped Patroclus of his arms, drags the ſlain along, vowing to lop the head from the trunk, and to give the mangled corſe a prey to the dogs of Troy. And the ſeventeenth book of the Iliad is wholly employed in deſcribing the conteſt about the body between the Greeks and Trojans. Beſide the brutality of preventing the laſt duties from being performed to a dead friend, it is a low ſcene, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of heroes. It was equally brutal in Achilles to drag the corſe of Hector to the ſhips, tied to his car. In a ſcene between Hector and Andromache<note n="s" place="bottom">Iliad, book 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>, the treatment of vanquiſhed enemies is pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically deſcribed; ſovereigns maſſacred, and their bodies left a prey to dogs and vultures; ſucking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants daſhed againſt the pavement; ladies of the firſt rank forced to perform the loweſt acts of ſlavery. Hector doth not diſſemble, that if Troy were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, his poor wife would be condemned to draw water like the vileſt ſlave. Hecuba, in Euripides, laments, that ſhe was chained like a dog at Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon's gate; and the ſame ſavage manners are deſcribed in many other Greek tragedies. Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus makes free with the heavenly fire, in order to give life to man. As a puniſhment for bringing rational creatures into exiſtence, the gods decree, that he be chained to a rock, and abandoned to birds of prey. Vulcan is introduced by Eſchylus rattling the chain, nailing one end to a rock, and the other to the breaſt-bone of the criminal.

a woman murdered by her children, would be hiſſed by every modern audience; and yet that horrid ſcene was repreſented with applauſe in the Electra of Sophocles. Stoboeus reports a ſaying of Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that even the gods cannot inſpire a ſoldier with civility: no wonder that the Greek ſoldiers were brutes and barbarians, when war was waged, not only againſt the ſtate, but againſt every individual. At preſent, humanity prevails among ſoldiers as among others; becauſe we make war only againſt a ſtate, not againſt individuals. The Greeks are the leſs excuſable for their cruelty, as they appear to have been ſenſible that humanity is a cardinal virtue. Barbarians are always painted by Homer as cruel; poliſhed nations as tender and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate:<q>
                     <l>" Ye gods! (he cried) upon what barren coaſt,</l>
                     <l>" In what new regions is Ulyſſes toſt;</l>
                     <l>" Poſſeſs'd by wild barbarians fierce in arms,</l>
                     <l>" Or men whoſe boſom tender pity warms?"</l>

               </p>
               <p>Cruelty is inconſiſtent with true heroiſm; and accordingly very little of the latter is diſcoverable in any of Homer's warriors. So much did they retain of the ſavage character, as, even without bluſhing, to fly from an enemy ſuperior in bodily ſtrength. Diomedes, who makes an illuſtrious figure in the fifth book of the Iliad, retires when Hector ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Diomedes beheld the chief, and ſhuddered to his inmoſt ſoul."</q> Antilochus, ſon of Neſtor, having ſlain Melanippus<note n="t" place="bottom">Book 15.</note>, ruſhed forward, eager to ſeize his bright arms. But ſeeing Hector, he fled like a beaſt of prey who ſhuns the gathering hinds. And the great Hector himſelf ſhamefully
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0032300302:28"/>
turns his back upon the near approach of Achilles: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Periphetes, endowed with every virtue, renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the race, great in war, in prudence excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his fellows, gave glory to Hector, covering the chief with renown."</q> One would expect a fierce combat between theſe two bold warriors. Not ſo. Periphetes ſtumbling, fell to the ground; and Hector was not aſhamed to transfix with his ſpear the unreſiſting hero.</p>
               <p>In the ſame tone of character, nothing is more common among Homer's warriors than to inſult a vanquiſhed foe. Patroclus, having beat Cebriones to the ground with a huge ſtone, derides his fall in the following words.<q>
                     <l>" Good heav'ns! what active feats yon artiſt ſhows,</l>
                     <l>" What ſkilful divers are our Phrygian foes!</l>
                     <l>" Mark with what eaſe they ſink into the ſand.</l>
                     <l>" Pity! that all their practice is by land."</l>
                  </q> The Greeks are repreſented<note n="u" place="bottom">Book 22.</note> one after another ſtabbing the dead body of Hector: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Nor ſtood an Argive near the chief who inflicted not a wound. Surely now, ſaid they, more eaſy of acceſs is Hector, than when he launched on the ſhips brands of devouring fire."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When ſuch were the manners of warriors at the ſiege of Troy, it is no wonder that the heroes on both ſides were not leſs intent on ſtripping the ſlain than on victory. They are every where repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as greedy of ſpoil.</p>
               <p>The Jews did not yield to the Greeks in cruelty. It is unneceſſary to give inſtances, as the hiſtorical books of the Old Teſtament are in the hands of every one. I ſhall ſelect one inſtance for a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0032300302:29"/>
dreadfully cruel without any juſt provocation: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought againſt it, and took it. And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under ſaws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them paſs through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon<note n="x" place="bottom">2 Samuel, xii. 29.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>That cruelty was predominant among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans is evident from every one of their hiſtorians. Brutality to their offspring was conſpicuous. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were held, like cattle, to be the father's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: and ſo tenacious was the patria poteſtas, that if a ſon or daughter ſold to be a ſlave was ſet free, he or ſhe fell again under the father s power, to be ſold a ſecond time, and even a third time. The power of life and death over children was much leſs unnatural, while no public tribunal exiſted for puniſhing crimes. A ſon, being a ſlave, could have no property of his own. Julius Caeſar was the firſt who privileged a ſon to retain for his own uſe ſpoils acquired in war. When law became a lucrative profeſſion, what a ſon gained in that way was declared to be his property. In Athens, a man had power of life and death over his children; but as they were not ſlaves, what they acquired belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themſelves. So late as the days of Diocleſian, a ſon's marriage did not diſſolve the Roman patria poteſtas<note n="y" place="bottom">l. 1. Cod. cap. De patria poteſtate.</note>. But the power of ſelling children wore out of uſe<note n="z" place="bottom">l. 10. eod.</note>. When powers ſo unnatural were given to men over their children, and exerciſed ſo tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically as to make a law neceſſary prohibiting the diſinheriting of children, can there be any doubt of their cruelty to others? During the ſecond trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate, horrid cruelties were every day perpetrated
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0032300302:30"/>
without pity or remorſe. Antony, having ordered Cicero to be beheaded, and the head to be brought to him, viewed it with ſavage pleaſure. His wife Fulvia laid hold of it, ſtruck it on the face, uttered many bitter execrations, and having placed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her knees, drew out the tongue, and pierced it with a bodkin. The delight it gave the Romans to ſee wild beaſts ſet looſe againſt one another in their circus, is a proof not at all ambiguous of their taſte for blood, even at the time of their higheſt civilization. The Edile Scaurus ſent at one time to Rome 150 panthers, Pompey 410, and Auguſtus 410, for the public ſpectacles. Their gladiatorian combats are not ſo clear a proof of their ferocity: the courage and addreſs exerted in theſe combats gave a manly pleaſure that balanced in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the pain of ſeeing theſe poor fellows cut and ſlaſh one another. And that the Romans were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cured of their itch for blood, appears from Caligula, Nero, and many other monſters, who governed the Romans from Auguſtus downward. There is no example in modern times of ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in France, though an abſolute monarchy, nor even in Turky.</p>
               <p>Ferocity was in the Roman empire conſiderably mollified by literature and other fine arts; but it acquired new vigour upon the irruption of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations who cruſhed that empire. In the year 559, Clotaire, King of the Franks, burnt alive his ſon, with all his friends, becauſe they had rebelled againſt him. Queen Brunehaud being, by Clotaire II. condemned to die, was dragged through the camp at a horſe's tail till ſhe gave up the ghoſt. The ferocity of European nations became altogether intolerable during the anarchy of the feudal ſyſtem. Many peaſants in the northern provinces of France being ſorely oppreſſed in civil wars carried on by the nobles againſt each other, turned deſperate,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0032300302:31"/>
gathered together in bodies, reſolving to extirpate all the nobles. A party of them, anno 1358, forced open the caſtle of a knight, hung him up upon a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, violated in his preſence his wife and daughters, roaſted him upon a ſpit, compelled his wife and children to eat of his fleſh, and terminated that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſcene with maſſacring the whole family, and burning the caſtle. When they were aſhed, ſays Froiſſard, why they committed ſuch abominable actions, their anſwer was, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That they did as they ſaw others do; and that all the nobles in the world ought to be deſtroyed."</q> The nobles, when they got the upper hand, were equally cruel. They put all to fire and ſword; and maſſacred eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry peaſant who came in the way, without troubling themſelves to ſeparate the innocent from the guilty. The Count de Ligny encouraged his nephew, a boy of fifteen, to kill with his own hand ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners who were his countrymen; in which, ſays Monſtrelet, the young man took great delight. How much worſe than brutal muſt have been the manners of that age! for even a beaſt of prey kills not but when inſtigated by hunger. The third act, of ſtealing from the lead-mines in Derby, was, by a law of Edward I. puniſhed in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: A hand of the criminal was nailed to a table; and in that ſtate he was left without meat or drink, having no means for freedom but to employ the one hand to cut off the other. The barbarity of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh at that period made ſevere puniſhments neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarary: but the puniſhment mentioned goes beyond ſeverity; it is brutal cruelty. The barbarous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jews, during the dark ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, gives pregnant evidence, that Chriſtians were not ſhort of Pagans in cruelty. Poiſon and aſſaſſination were moſt licentiouſly perpetrated, no farther back than the laſt century. Some pious men made vigorous efforts in more than one general
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0032300302:32"/>
council to have aſſaſſination condemned, as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the law of God; but in vain<note n="*" place="bottom">It required the ferocity and cruelty of a barbarous age to give currency to a Mahometan doctrine, That the ſword is the moſt effectual means of converting men to a dominant religion. The eſtabliſhment of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition will not permit me to ſay, that Chriſtians never put in practice a doctrine ſo deteſtable: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they ſurpaſs the Mahometans, giving no quar er to heretics, either in this life, or in that to come. The eternity of hell torments is a doctrine no leſs inconſiſtent with the juſtice of the Deity, than with his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note>.</p>
               <p>I wiſh to ſoften the foregoing ſcene: it may be ſoftened a little. Among barbarians, puniſhments muſt be ſanguinary; as their bodies only are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pain, not their minds.</p>
               <p>The reſtoration of arts and ſciences in Europe, followed with a reformation in religion, had a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effect in ſweetening manners, and promoting the intereſts of ſociety. Of all crimes high treaſon is the moſt involved in circumſtances, and upon that account the moſt difficult to be defined or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed: at the ſame time, the influence of government upon its judges ſeldom permits a fair trial. And yet, for that crime are reſerved the moſt exquiſite torments. In England, the puniſhment is, to cut up the criminal alive, to tear out his heart, to daſh it about his ears, and to throw it into the flames. The ſame puniſhment continues in form, not in reality: the heart indeed is torn out, but not till the criminal is ſtrangled. Even the virulence of religious zeal is conſiderably abated. Savonarola was condemned to the flames as an impious impoſtor; but he was firſt privately ſtrangled. The fine arts, which humanize man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were in Italy at that time accelerating toward
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0032300302:33"/>
perfection. The famous Latimer was in England condemned to be burnt for hereſy: but bags of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder were put under his arms, that he might be burnt with the leaſt pain. Even Knox, a violent Scotch reformer, acknowledges, that Wiſhart was ſtrangled before he was thrown into the flames for hereſy. So bitter was the late perſecution againſt the Jeſuits, that not only were their perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but in many places their books, not even excepting books upon mathematics, and other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract ſubjects. That perſecution reſembled in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars the perſecution againſt the knights<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templars: fifty-nine of the latter were burnt alive: the former were really leſs innocent; and yet ſuch humanity prevails at preſent, that not a drop of Jeſuit-blood has been ſhed. A bankrupt in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, if he has not ſuffered by unavoidable misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is by law condemned to wear a party-coloured garment. That law is not now put in execution, unleſs where a bankrupt deſerves to be ſtigmatized for his culpable miſconduct.</p>
               <p>Whether the following late inſtance of barbarity does not equal any of thoſe above mentioned, I leave to my readers. No traveller who viſited Peterſburgh during the reign of the Empreſs Elizabeth can be ignorant of Madam Lapouchin, the great ornament of that court. Her intimacy with a foreign ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador having brought her under ſuſpicion of plotting with him againſt the government, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to undergo the puniſhment of the knout. At the place of execution ſhe appeared in a genteel undreſs, which heightened her beauty. Of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indiſcretion ſhe might have been guilty, the ſweetneſs of her countenance, and her compoſure, left not in the ſpectators the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion of guilt. Her youth alſo, her beauty, her life and ſpirit pleaded for her.—But all in vain: ſhe was deſerted by all, and abandoned to ſurly execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0032300302:34"/>
whom ſhe beheld with aſtoniſhment, ſeeming to doubt whether ſuch preparations were intended for her. The cloak that covered her boſom being pulled off, modeſty took the alarm, and made her ſtart back: ſhe turned pale, and burſt into tears. One of the executioners ſtripped her naked to the waiſt, ſeized her by both hands, and threw her on his back, raiſing her ſome inches from the ground. The other executioner laying hold of her delicate limbs with his rough fiſts, put her in a poſture for receiving the puniſhment. Then laying hold of the knout, a ſort of whip made of a leathern ſtrap, he retreated a few ſteps, and with a ſingle ſtroke tore off a ſlip of ſkin from the neck downward, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating his ſtrokes till all the ſkin of her back was cut off in ſmall ſlips. The executioner finiſhed his taſk with cutting out her tongue; after which ſhe was baniſhed to Siberia<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent Empreſs has laid an excellent founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for civilizing her people, which is a Code of laws, founded on principles of civil liberty, baniſhing ſlavery and torture, and expreſſing the utmoſt regard for the life, property, and liberty, of all her ſubjects, high and low.

               <p>The native inhabitants of the iſland Amboyna are Malayans.

               <p>In early times, when revenge and cruelty tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on law, people formed aſſociations for ſecuring their lives and their poſſeſſions. Theſe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Scandinavia and in Scotland. They were alſo common in England during the Anglo-Saxon period, and for ſome ages after the Conqueſt. But inſtead of ſupporting juſtice, they contributed more than any other cauſe to anarchy and confuſion, the members protecting each other, even in robbery and murder. They were ſuppreſſed in England by a ſtatute of Richard II.; and in Scotland by reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>Roughneſs and harſhneſs of manners are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with cruelty; and the manners of the Greeks and Trojans are accordingly repreſented in the Iliad as remarkably rough and harſh. When the armies were ready to engage<note n="a" place="bottom">Book 4.</note>, Meneſtheus King of Athens, and Ulyſſes of Ithaca, are bitterly reproached by Agamemnon for lingering, while others were more forward. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Son of Peleus, he ſaid, and thou verſed in artful deceil, in miſchief only wiſe, why trembling ſhrink ye back from the field; why wait till others engage in fight?

Your delight is to eat, to regale, to quaff unſtinted the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wine."</q> In the fifth book Sarpedon upbraids Hector for cowardice. And Tlepolemus, ready to engage with Sarpedon, attacks him firſt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling and ſcurrilous words. Becauſe Hector was not able to reſcue the dead body of Sarpedon from the Greeks, he is upbraided by Glaucus, Sarpedon's friend, in the following words. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hector, though

               <p>Rough and harſh manners produced ſlavery; and ſlavery ſoſtered rough and harſh manners, by giving them conſtant exerciſe. The brutality of the Spartans to the Helots, their ſlaves, is a reproach to the human ſpecies. Beſide the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſage, they were prevented from multiplying by downright murder and maſſacre. Why did not ſuch barbarity render the Spartans deteſtable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being reſpected by their neighbours, as the moſt virtuous people in Greece? There can be but one reaſon, that the Greeks were all of them cruel, the Spartans a little more, perhaps, than the reſt. In Rome, a ſlave, chained at the gate of every great houſe, gave admittance to the gueſts invited to a feaſt: could any but barbarians bear ſuch a ſpectacle without pain? If a Roman citizen was found murdered in his own houſe, his whole houſehold-ſlaves, perhaps two or three hundred, were put to death without mercy, unleſs they could detect the murderer. Such a law, cruel and unjuſt, could never have been enacted among a people of any humanity.</p>

ſuch criminals perpetually in view would harden the hearts of the ſpectators, and eradicate pity, a capital moral paſſion. Behold the behaviour of the Dutch, in the Iſland of Amboyna. A native who is found guilty of theft is deprived of his ears and noſe, and made a ſlave for life. William Funnel, who was there anno 1705, reports, that five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of theſe wretches were ſecured in priſon, and never ſuffered to go abroad, but in order to ſaw timber, to cut ſtone, or to carry heavy burdens. Their food is a pittance of coarſe rice, boiled in water, and their bed the hard ground. What is ſtill worſe, poor people, who happen to run in debt, are turned over to the ſervants of the Eaſt India company, who ſend them to work among their ſlaves, with a daily allowance of two pence, which goes to the creditor. A nation muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of bowels, who can eſtabliſh ſuch inhumanity by law. But time has rendered that practice fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Dutch, ſo as to behold, with abſolute indifference, the multiplied miſeries of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures. It appears, indeed, that ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be more effectual than death, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theft; but can any one doubt, that ſociety would ſuffer more by eradicating pity and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than it would gain by removing every one by death who is guilty of theft? At the ſame time, the Dutch, however cruel to the natives, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely complaiſant to one another: ſeldom is any one of them puniſhed but for murder: a ſmall ſum will procure pardon for any other crime.</p>

The moſt reſpectable perſons of the republic are ridiculed by name, in the comedies of Ariſtopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which wallow in looſeneſs and detraction. In the third act of Andromaché, a tragedy of Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides, Peleus and Menelaus, Kings of Theſſaly and Sparta, fall into downright ribaldry; Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus ſwearing that he would not give up his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, and Peleus threatening to knock him down with his ſtaff. The manners of Jaſon, in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of Medea by Euripides, are woefully indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. With unparalleled gratitude to his wife Medea, he, in her preſence, makes love to the King of Corinth's daughter, and obtains her in marriage. Inſtead of ſhunning a perſon he had ſo deeply injured, he endeavours to excuſe himſelf to her in a very ſneaking manner, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that he was an exile like herſelf, without ſupport; and that his marriage would acquire powerful friends to them and to their children."</q> Could he imagine, that ſuch frigid reaſons would touch a woman of any ſpirit? But the moſt ſtriking picture of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate manners is exhibited in the tragedy of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtes. Admetus prevails upon Alceſtes, his loving and beloved wife, to die in his ſtead. What a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian muſt the man be, who graſps at life upon ſuch a condition? How ridiculous is the bombaſt flouriſh of Admetus, that, if he were Orpheus, he would pierce to hell, brave the three-headed Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus, and reſtore his wife to earth again! And how indecently does he ſcold his father, for refuſing to die for him! What pretext could the monſter have to complain of his father, when he himſelf was ſo diſgracefully fond of life, as even to ſolicit his beloved wife to die in his ſtead! What ſtronger

inſtance, after all, would one require of indelicacy in the manners of the Greeks, than that they held all the world, except themſelves, to be barbarians? In that particular, however, they are not altogether ſingular. Though the Tartars, as mentioned above, were foul-feeders, and hoggiſhly naſty, yet they were extremely proud, deſpiſing, like the Greeks, every other nation. The people of Congo think the world to be the work of angels; except their own country, which they hold to be the handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the ſupreme architect. The Greenlanders have a high conceit of themſelves; and, in private, make a mock of the Europeans, or Kablunets, as they call them. Deſpiſing arts and ſciences, they value themſelves on their ſkill in catching ſeals, conceiving it to be the only uſeful art. They hold themſelves to be the only civilized and well-bred people; and when they ſee a modeſt ſtranger, they ſay, <q rend="inline">"he begins to be a man;"</q> that is, to be like one of themſelves.</p>
               <p>So coarſe and indelicate were Roman manners, that whipping was a puniſhment inflicted on the officers of the army, not even excepting centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions<note n="b" place="bottom">Julius Capitolinus, in the Life of Albinus.</note>. Doth it not ſhow extreme groſſneſs of manners, to expreſs, in plain words, the parts that modeſty bids us conceal? and yet this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Greek and Roman writers. In the Cyclops of Euripides, there is repreſented a ſcene of the vice againſt nature, groſsly obſcene, without the leaſt diſguiſe. How woefully indelicate muſt the man have been, who could ſit down gravely to compoſe ſuch a piece! and how diſſolute muſt the ſpectators have been, who could behold ſuch a ſcene without hiſſing! Next to the indecency of expoſing one's nudities in good company, is the talking of them without reſerve. Horace is extremely obſcene, and Martial no leſs. But I

cenſure neither of them, and, as little, the Queen of Navarre for her Tales; for they wrote according to the manners of the times. It is the manners I cenſure, not the writers. A woman taken in adultery was proſtituted in the public ſtreet to all comers, a bell ringing the whole time. This abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practice was aboliſhed by the Emperor Theodoſius<note n="c" place="bottom">Socrates, Hiſt. Eccl. lib. 5. cap. 18.</note>.</p>
               <p>The manners of Europe, before the revival of letters, were no leſs coarſe than cruel. In the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tularies of Charlemagne, judges are forbid to hold courts but in the morning, with an empty ſtomach. It would appear, that men in thoſe days were not aſhamed to be ſeen drunk, even in a court of juſtice. It was cuſtomary, both in France and Italy, to collect for ſport all the ſtrumpets in the neighbourhood, and to make them run races. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral feudal tenures give evidence of manners both low and coarſe. Struvius mentions a tenure, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vaſſal, on the birth-day of his lord, to dance and fart before him. The cod-piece, which, a few centuries ago, made part of a man's dreſs, and which ſwelled, by degrees, to a monſtrous ſize, teſtifies ſhamefully-coarſe manners; and yet it was a modeſt ornament, compared with one uſed in France, during the reign of Lewis XI. which was the figure of a man's privy parts worn upon the coat or breeches. In the ſame period, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris was a favourite theatrical entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: three women, ſtark-naked, repreſented the three goddeſſes, Juno, Venus, and Minerva. Nick-names, ſo common not long ago, are an inſtance of the ſame coarſeneſs of manners; for to fix a nick-name on a man, is to uſe him with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous familiarity. In the thirteenth century, many clergymen refuſed to adminiſter the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>Swearing, as an expletive of ſpeech, is a violent ſymptom of rough and coarſe manners. Such ſwearing prevails among all barbarous nations. Even women in Plautus ſwear fluently. Swearing prevailed in Spain and in France, till it was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by polite manners. Our Queen Elizabeth was a bold ſwearer; and the Engliſh populace, who are rough beyond their neighbours, are noted by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for that vice. Tho' ſwearing, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force an expreſſion, is not in itſelf immoral; it is, however, hurtful in its conſequences, rendering ſacred names too familiar. God's-beard, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon oath of William Rufus, ſuggeſts an image of our Maker as an old man with a long beard. In vain have acts of parliament been made againſt ſwearing: it is eaſy to evade the penalty, by coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new oaths; and as that vice proceeds from an overſlow of ſpirits, people in that condition brave penalties. Poliſhed manners are the only effectual cure for that malady.</p>
               <p>When a people begin to emerge out of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, loud mirth and rough jokes come in place of rancour and reſentment. About a century ago, it was uſual for the ſervants and retainers of the court of ſeſſion in Scotland, to break out into riotous mirth and uproar the laſt day of every term, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bags, duſt, ſand, or ſtones, all around. We have undoubted evidence of that diſorderly practice from an act of the court, prohibiting it under a ſevere penalty, as diſhonourable to the court,

and unbecoming the civility requiſite in ſuch a place<note n="d" place="bottom">Act of Sederunt, 21ſt February, 1663.</note>.</p>
               <p>And this leads to the lowneſs of ancient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; plainly diſtinguiſhable from ſimplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the latter is agreeable, not the former. Among the ancient Egyptians, to cram a man was an act of high reſpect. Joſeph, the King's firſt miniſter, in order to honour Benjamin above his brethren, gave him a five-ſold meſs<note n="e" place="bottom">Gen. xliii. 34.</note>. The Greeks, in their feaſts, diſtinguiſhed their heroes by a double portion<note n="f" place="bottom">Odyſſey, b. 8. v. 513. b. 15. v. 156.</note>. Ulyſſes cut a fat piece out of the chine of a wild boar for Demodocus the bard<note n="g" place="bottom">Odyſſey, b. 8. v. 519.</note>. The ſame reſpectful politeneſs is practiſed at preſent among the American ſavages; ſo much are all men alike in ſimilar circumſtances. Telemachus<note n="h" place="bottom">Odyſſey, b. 2.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains bitterly of Penelope's ſuitors, that they were gluttons, and conſumed his beef and mutton. The whole fourteenth book of the Odyſſey, containing the reception of Ulyſſes by Eumaeus the ſwine-herd, is miſerably low. Manners muſt be both groſs and low where common beggars are admitted to the feaſts of princes, and receive ſcraps from their hands<note n="i" place="bottom">See 17th &amp; 18th books of the Odyſſey.</note>. In Rome, every gueſt brought his own napkin to a feaſt. A ſlave carried it home, filled with what was left from the entertainment. Sophocles, in his tragedy of Iphigenia in Aulis, repreſents Clytemneſtra ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping down from her car, and exhorting her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to look after her baggage, with the anxiety and minuteneſs of a lady's waiting woman. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paints, in lively colours, the riches of the Phoeacians, their ſkill in navigation, the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0032300302:45"/>
of the king's court, of his palace, and of the public buildings. But, with the ſame breath, he deſcribes Nauſicaa, the king's daughter, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to the river on a waggon of greaſy cloaths, to be waſhed there by her and her maids. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it will be urged that ſuch circumſtances, however low in our opinion, might appear other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Greeks. If they had appeared low to the Greeks, they would not have been introduced by their greateſt poet. But what does this prove, other than that the Greeks were low in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Their manners did not correſpond to the delicacy of their taſte in the fine arts. Nor can it be expected that they ſhould correſpond, when the Greeks were ſtrangers to that polite ſociety with women, which refines behaviour, and elevates manners. The firſt kings in Greece, as Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides obſerves, were elective, having no power but to command their armies in time of war; which reſembles the government that obtains at preſent in the Iſthmus of Darien. They had no written laws, being governed by cuſtom merely. To live by plunder was held honourable; for it was their opinion, that the rules of juſtice are not intended for reſtraining the powerful. All ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were accounted enemies, as among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; and inns were unknown, becauſe people lived at home, having very little intercourſe even with thoſe of their own nation. Inns were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in Germany; and to this day are unknown in the remote parts of the Highlands of Scotland; but for an oppoſite reaſon, that hoſpitality prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed greatly among the ancient Germans, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to prevail ſo much among our Highlanders, that a gentleman takes it for an affront, if a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger paſs his houſe. At a congreſs between Francis I. of France, and Henry VIII. of England, among other ſpectacles for public entertainment, the two
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0032300302:46"/>
kings had a wreſtling-match. Had they forgot that they were ſovereign princes?</p>
               <p>One would imagine war to be a ſoil too rough for the growth of civilization; and yet it is not always an unkindly ſoil. War between two ſmall tribes is fierce and cruel: but a large ſtate mitigates reſentment, by directing it, not againſt individuals, but againſt the ſtate in general. We know no enemies but thoſe who are in arms: we have no reſentment againſt others, but rather find a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in treating them with humanity. Barbarity and cruelty, having thus in war few individuals for their objects, naturally ſubſide; and magnanimity in their ſtead transforms ſoliders from brutes to heroes. Some time ago, it was uſual in France to demand battle; and it was held diſhonourable to decline it, however unequal the match. Here was heroiſm without prudence; but in all reformations it is natural to go from one extreme to the other. While the King of England held any poſſeſſions in France, war was perpetual between the two nations, which was commonly carried on with more magnanimity than is uſual between inveterate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. It became cuſtomary to give priſoners their freedom, upon a ſimple parole to return with their ranſom at a day named. The ſame was the cuſtom in the border-wars between the Engliſh and Scots, before their union under one monarch. Both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties found their account equally in ſuch honourable behaviour. Edward Prince of Wales, in a pitched battle againſt the French, took the illuſtrious Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trand du Gueſclin priſoner. He long declined to accept a ranſom; but finding it whiſpered that he was afraid of that hero, he inſtantly ſet him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty without a ranſom. This may be deemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic or whimſical: but is love of glory leſs praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy than love of conqueſt? The Duke of Guiſe, victor in the battle of Dreux, reſted all night in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0032300302:47"/>
field of battle; and gave the Prince of Conde, his priſoner, a ſhare of his bed, where they lay like brothers. The Chevalier Bayard, commander of a French army, anno 1524, being mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in retreating from the Imperialiſts, placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a tree, his face however to the enemy. The Marquis de Peſcara, General of the Imperial forces, finding him dead in that poſture, behaved with the generoſity of a gallant adverſary: he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his body to be embalmed, and to be ſent to his relations in the moſt honourable manner. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and heroiſm, in which benevolence is an eſſential ingredient, are inconſiſtent with cruelty, perſidy, or any groveling paſſion. Never was gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry in war carried to a greater height, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Engliſh and Scotch borderers before the crowns were united. The night after the battle of Otterburn, the victors and vanquiſhed lay promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly in the ſame camp, without apprehending the leaſt danger one from the other. The manners of ancient warriors were very different. Homer's hero, tho' ſuperior to all in bodily ſtrength, takes every advantage of his enemy; and never feels either compaſſion or remorſe. The politic of the Greeks and Romans in war, was to weaken the ſtate by plundering its territory, and deſtroying its people. Humanity with us prevails even in war. Individuals not in arms are ſecure, which ſaves much innocent blood. Priſoners were ſet at liberty upon paying a ranſom; and by later improvements in manners, even that practice is left off, as too mercantile, a more honourable practice being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, viz. a cartel for exchange of priſoners. Humanity was carried to a ſtill greater height, in our late war with France, by an agreement between the Duke de Noailles and the Earl of Stair, That the hoſpitals for the ſick and wounded ſoldiers ſhould be ſecure from all hoſtilities. The humanity of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0032300302:48"/>
Duke de Randan, in the ſame war, makes an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious figure even in the preſent age, remarkable for humanity to enemies. When the French troops were compelled to abandon their conqueſts in the electorate of Hanover, their Generals every where burnt their magazines, and plundered the people. The Duke de Randan, who commanded in the city of Hanover, put the magiſtrates in poſſeſſion of his magazines, requeſting them to diſtribute the contents among the poor; and he was beſide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely vigilant to prevent his ſoldiers from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting acts of violence<note n="*" place="bottom">Such kindlineſs in an enemy from whom nothing is expected but miſchief, is an illuſtrious inſtance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity And a ſimilar inſtance will not make the leſs figure that it was done by a man of inferior rank. When Monſ. Thurot, during our late war with France; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the coaſt of Scotland with three armed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, the terror he at firſt ſpread ſoon yielded to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration inſpired by his humanity. He paid a rull price for every thing he wanted; and in general behaved with ſo much affability, that a countryman ventured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him of an officer who had taken from him fifty or ſixty guineas. The officer acknowledged the fact; but ſaid, that he had divided the money among his men. Thurot ordered the officer to give his bill for the money, which, he ſaid, ſhould be ſtopped out of his pay, if they were ſo fortunate as to return to France. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this incident with that of the great Scipio, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Roman ſtory, who reſtored a beautiful bride to the bridegroom, and it will not ſuffer by the compariſon. Another inſtance is no leſs remarkable. One of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers gave a bill upon a merchant in France, for the price of proviſions purchaſed by him. Thurot having accidentally ſeen the bill, informed the countryman that it was of no value, reprimanded the officer bitterly for the cheat, and compelled him to give a bill upon a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant who he knew would pay the money. At that very time, Thurot's men were in bad humour, and were diſpoſed to mutiny. In ſuch circumſtances, would not Thurot have been excuſed, for winking at a fraud to which he was not acceſſary? But he acted all along with the ſtricteſt honour, even at the hazard of a mutiny. Common honeſty to an enemy is not a common practice in war. Thurot was ſtrictly honeſt in circumſtances that made the exertion of common honeſty an act of the higheſt magnanimity. Theſe incidents ought to be held up to princes as examples of true heroiſm. War carried on in that manner would, from deſolation and horror, be converted into a fair-field for acquiring true military glory, and for exerciſing every manly virtue. I feel the greateſt ſatisfaction in paying this tribute of praiſe to the memory of that great man. He will be kept in remembrance by every true-hearted Briton. tho' he died fighting againſt us But he died in the field of honour, fighting for his country.</note>. The neceſſity of fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0032300302:49"/>
towns to guard from deſtruction the innocent and defenceleſs, affords convincing evidence of the ſavage cruelty that prevailed in former times. By the growth of humanity, ſuch fortifications have become leſs frequent; and they ſerve no purpoſe at preſent but to defend againſt invaſion; in which view a ſmall fortification, if but ſufficient for the garriſon, is greatly preferable; being conſtructed at a much leſs expence, and having no mouths to provide for but the garriſon only.</p>
               <p>In the progreſs of ſociety there is commonly a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable period, when ſocial and diſſocial paſſions ſeem to bear equal ſway, prevailing alternately. In the hiſtory of Alexander's ſucceſſors, there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances of cruelty, equalling that of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſavages; and inſtances no leſs frequent of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, of generoſity, and even of clemency, that betoken manners highly poliſhed. Ptolemy of Egypt, having gained a complete victory over De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, ſon of Antigonus, reſtored to him his equipage, his friends, and his domeſtics, ſaying,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0032300302:50"/>
that <q rend="inline margQuotes">"they ought not to make war for plunder, but for glory."</q> Demetrius having defeated one of Ptolemy's Generals, was leſs delighted with the victory, than with the opportunity of rivalling his antagoniſt in humanity. The ſame Demetrius having reſtored liberty to the Athenians, was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them as a demi-god; and yet afterward, in his adverſity, their gates were ſhut againſt him. Upon a change of fortune he laid ſiege to Athens, reſolving to chaſtiſe that rebellious and ungrateful people. He aſſembled the inhabitants in the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, ſurrounding them with his army, as preparing for a total maſſacre. But their terror was ſhort; he pronounced their pardon, and beſtowed on them 100,000 meaſures of wheat. Ptolemy, the ſame who is mentioned above, having at the ſiege of Tyre ſummoned Andronicus the governor to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, received a provoking and contemptuous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The town being taken, Andronicus gave himſelf over for loſt: but the King, thinking it below his dignity to reſent an injury againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, now his priſoner, not only overlooked the affront, but courted Andronicus to be his friend. Edward the Black Prince is an inſlance of refined manners, breaking, like a ſpark of fire, through the gloom of barbarity. The Emperor Charles V. after loſing 30,000 men at the ſiege of Metz, made an ignominious retreat, leaving his camp filled with ſick and wounded, dead and dying. Though the war between him and the King of France was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with unuſual rancour, yet the Duke of Guiſe, governor of the town, exerted in thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous times a degree of humanity that would make a ſplendid figure even at preſent: He ordered plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of food for thoſe who were dying of hunger, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſurgeons to attend the ſick and wounded, removed to the adjacent villages thoſe who could bear motion, and admitted the remainder into the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0032300302:51"/>
hoſpitals that he had fitted up for his own ſoldiers; thoſe who recovered their health were ſent home, with money to defray the expence of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>In the period that intervenes between barbarity and humanity, there are not wanting inſtances of oppoſite paſſions in the ſame perſon, governing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately; as if a man could this moment be mild and gentle, and next moment harſh and brutal. To vouch the obſervation, I beg leave to introduce two rival monarchs, who for many years diſtreſſed their own people, and diſturbed Europe, viz. the Emperor Charles, and the French King Francis. The Emperor, driven by contrary winds on the coaſt of France, was invited by Francis, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in the neighbourhood, to take ſhelter in his dominions, propoſing an interview at Aigues-Mortes, a ſea-port town. The Emperor inſtantly repaired there in his galley; and Francis, relying on the Emperor's honour, viſited him on ſhipboard, and was received with every expreſſion of affection. Next day, the Emperor repaid the confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him: he landed at Aigues-Mortes with as little precaution, and found a reception equally cordial. After twenty years of open hoſtilities, or of ſecret enmity, after having formally given the lie, and challenged each other to ſingle combat, after the Emperor had publicly inveighed againſt Francis as void of honour, and Francis had accuſed the Emperor as murderer of his own ſon; ſuch behaviour will ſcarce be thought conſiſtent with human nature. But theſe monarchs lived in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod verging from cruelty to humanity; and ſuch periods abound with ſurpriſing changes of temper and conduct. In the preſent times, ſuch changes are unknown.</p>
               <p>Conqueſt has not always the ſame effect upon the manners of the conquered. The Tartars who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0032300302:52"/>
ſubdued China in the thirteenth century, adopted immediately the Chineſe manners: the government, laws, cuſtoms, continued without variation. And the ſame happened upon their ſecond conqueſt of China in the ſeventeenth century. The barbarous nations alſo who cruſhed the Roman empire, adopted the laws, cuſtoms, and manners, of the conquered. Very different was the fate of the Greek empire when conquered by the Turks That warlike nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced every where their own laws and manners: even at this day they continue a diſtinct people, as much as ever. The Tartars, as well as the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians who overthrew the Roman empire, were all of them rude and illiterate, deſtitute of laws, and ignorant of government. Such nations readily adopt the laws and manners of a civilized people, whom they admire. The Turks had laws, and a regular government; and the Greeks, when ſubdued by them, were reduced by luxury and ſenſuality to be objects of contempt, not of imitation.</p>
               <p>Manners are deeply affected by perſecution. The forms of procedure in the Inquiſition enable the inquiſitors to ruin whom they pleaſe. A perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed is not confronted with the accuſer: every ſort of accuſation is welcome, and from every perſon: a child, a common proſtitute, one branded with infamy, are reputable witneſſes: a ſon is compelled to give evidence againſt his father, and a woman againſt her huſband. Nay, the perſons accuſed are compelled to inform againſt themſelves, by gueſſing what ſin they may have been guilty of. Such odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, cruel. and tyrannical proceedings, made all Spain tremble: every man diſtruſted his neighbour, and even his own family: a total end was put to friendſhip, and to ſocial freedom. Hence the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and reſerve of a people, who have naturally all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0032300302:53"/>
the vivacity of a temperate clime and bountiful ſoil<note n="*" place="bottom">The populace of Spain, too low game for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, are abundantly chearful, perhaps more ſo than thoſe of France.</note>. Hence the profound ignorance of that people, while other European nations are daily improving in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry art and in every ſcience. Human nature is reduced to its loweſt ſtate, when governed by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition clothed with power.</p>
               <p>We proceed to another capital article in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of manners, viz. the ſelfiſh and ſocial branches of our nature, by which manners are greatly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced. Selfiſhneſs prevails among ſavages; becauſe corporeal pleaſures are its chief objects, and of the e every ſavage is perfectly ſenſible. Benevolence and kindly affection are too refined for a ſavage, unleſs of the ſimpleſt kind, ſuch as the ties of blood. While artificial wants were unknown, ſelfiſhneſs made no ſigure: the means of gratifying the calls of nature were in plenty; and men, who are not afraid of ever being in want, never think of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it; and far leſs do they think of coveting what belongs to another. But men are not long contented with ſimple neceſſaries: an unwearied appetite to be more and more comfortably provided, leads them from neceſſaries to conveniencies, and from theſe to every luxury of life. Avarice turns headſtrong; and locks and bars, formerly unknown, become neceſſary to protect individuals from the rapacity of their neighbours. When the goods of fortune, money in particular, come to be prized, ſelfiſhneſs ſoon diſplays itſelf. In Madagaſcar, a man who makes a preſent of an ox or a calf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the value in return: and ſcruples not to ſay, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You my friend, I your friend; you no my friend, I no your friend; I ſalamanca you, you ſalamanca me."</q> Salamanca means, the making a preſent.

Admiral Watſon being introduced to the King of Baba, in Madagaſcar, was aſked by his Majeſty, what preſents he had brought. Hence the cuſtom, univerſal among barbarians, of always accoſting a king, or any man of high rank, with preſents. The peculiar excellence of man, above all other animals, is the capacity he has of improving by education and example. In proportion as his faculties refine, he acquires a reliſh for ſociety, and finds a pleaſure in benevolence, generoſity, and in every other kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection, far above what ſelfiſhneſs can afford. How agreeable is this ſcene! Alas, too agreeable to laſt for ever. Opulence and luxury inflame the hoarding appetite; and ſelfiſhneſs at laſt prevails as it did originally. The ſelfiſhneſs however of ſavages differs from that of pampered people. Luxury, confining a man's whole views to himſelf, admits not of friendſhip, and ſcarce of any other ſocial paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But where a ſavage takes a liking to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, the whole force of his ſocial affection being directed to a ſingle object, becomes extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fervid. Hence the unexampled friendſhip between Achilles and Patroclus in the Iliad; and hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch friendſhips among ſavages.</p>
               <p>But there is much more to be ſaid of the influence of opulence on manners. Rude and illiterate nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are tenacious of their laws and manners; for they are governed by cuſtom, which is more and more rivetted by length of time. A people, on the contrary, who are poliſhed by having paſſed through various ſcenes, are full of invention, and conſtantly thinking of new modes. Manners in particular can never be ſtationary, in a nation which is refined by proſperity and the arts of peace. Good government will advance men to a high degree of civilization; but the very beſt government will not preſerve them from corruption, after becoming rich by proſperity. Opulence begets luxury, and envigorates the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0032300302:55"/>
for ſenſual pleaſure. The appetite, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, is never confined within moderate bounds, but clings to every object of gratification, without regard to propriety or decency. When Septimius Severus was elected Emperor, he found on the roll of cauſes depending before the judges in Rome no fewer than three thouſand accuſations of adultery. From that moment he abandoned all thoughts of attempting a reformation. Love of pleaſure is ſimilar to love of money: the more they are indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more they are inflamed. Polygamy is an incentive to the vice againſt nature; one act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence leading to others, without end. When the Sultan Achmet was depoſed at Conſtantinople, the people breaking into the houſe of one of his favourites, found not a ſingle woman. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Algerines, that in many of their ſeraglios there are no women. For the ſame reaſon, poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy is far from preventing adultery, a truth finely illuſtrated in Nathan's parable to David. What judgement then are we to form of the opulent cities London and Paris, where pleaſure is the ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and where riches are coveted as inſtruments of ſenſuality? What is to be expected but a peſtifer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous corruption of manners? Selfiſhneſs, ingroſſing the whole ſoul, eradicates patriotiſm, and leaves not a cranny for ſocial virtue. If in that condition men abſtain from robbery or from murder, it is not love of juſtice that reſtrains them, but dread of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Babylon is arraigned by Greek writers for luxury, ſenſuality, and profligacy. But Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon repreſents the capital of every opulent kingdom, ancient and modern: the manners of all are the ſame; for power and riches never fail to produce luxury, ſenſuality, and profligacy. Canghi Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of China, who died in the year 1722, deſerves to be recorded in the annals of fame, for reſiſting the ſoftneſs and effeminacy of an Aſiatic court. Far

from abandoning himſelf to ſenſual pleaſure, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral months yearly in the mountains of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, moſtly on horſeback, and declining no fatigue. Nor in that ſituation were affairs of ſtate neglected: many hours he borrowed from ſleep, to hear his miniſters, and to iſſue orders. How few monarchs, bred up like Canghi in the downy indolence of a feraglio, have reſolution to withſtand the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſenſual pleaſure!</p>
               <p>In no other hiſtory is the influence of proſperity and opulence on manners ſo conſpicuous as in that of old Rome. During the ſecond Punic war, when the Romans were reduced by Hannibal to fight pro aris et focis, Hiero King of Syracuſe ſent to Rome a large quantity of corn, with a golden ſtatue of victory weighing three hundred and twenty pounds, which the ſenate accepted. But though their finances were at the loweſt ebb, they accepted but the lighteſt of forty golden vaſes preſented to them by the city of Naples; and politely returned, with many thanks, ſome golden vaſes ſent by the city of Paeſtum, in Lucania: A rare inſtance of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity! But no degree of virtue is proof againſt the corruption of conqueſt and opulence. Upon the infiux of Aſiatic riches and luxury, the Romans abandoned themſelves to every vice: they became in particular wonderfully avaricious, breaking thro' every reſtraint of juſtice and humanity<note n="*" place="bottom">

particular, which abounded with gold and ſilver, was for many years a ſcene, not only of oppreſſion and cruelty, but of the baſeſt treachery, practiſed againſt the natives by ſucceſſive Roman generals in order to accumulate wealth. Lucullus, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made a capital figure in the Mithridatic war, attacked Cauca, a Celtiberian city, without the ſlighteſt provocation. Some of the principal citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens repaired to his camp with olive-branches, deſiring to be informed upon what conditions they could purchaſe his friendſhip. It was agreed, that they ſhould give hoſtages, with an hundred talents of ſilver. They alſo conſented to admit a garriſon of 2000 men, in order, as Lucullus pretended, to protect them againſt their enemies. But how were they protected? The gates were opened by the garriſon to the whole army; and the inhabitants were butchered, without diſtinction of ſex or age. What other remedy had they, but to invoke the gods preſiding over oaths and covenants, and to pour out execrations againſt the Romans for their perfidy? Lucullus, enriched with the ſpoils of the town, felt no remorſe for leaving 20,000 perſons dead upon the ſpot. Shortly after, having laid ſiege to Intercatia, he ſolicited a treaty of peace. The citizens, reproaching him with the ſlaughter of the Cauceans, aſked, whether, in making peace, he was not to employ the ſame right hand, and the ſame faith, he had already pledged to their country-men. Seroclius Galba, another Roman general, perſuaded the Luſitanians to lay down their arms, promiſing them a fruitful territory inſtead of their own mountains; and having thus got them into his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0032300302:58"/>
power, he ordered all of them to be murdered. Of the few that eſcaped Viriatus was one, who, in a long and bloody war againſt the Romans, amply avenged the maſſacre of his countrymen. Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Appian reports, that Galba, ſurpaſſing even Lucullus in covetouſneſs, diſtributed but a ſmall ſhare of the plunder among the ſoldiers, converting the bulk of it to his own uſe. He adds, that tho' Galba was one of the richeſt men in Rome, yet he never ſcrupled at lies nor perjury to procure money. But the corruption was general: Galba being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of many miſdemeanors, was acquitted by the ſenate through the force of bribes. A tribe of the Celtiberians, who had long ſerved the Romans againſt the Luſitanians, had an offer made them by Titus Didius of a territory in their neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, lately conquered by him. He appointed them a day to receive poſſeſſion; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed them in his camp under ſhew of friendſhip, he put them all to the ſword; for which mighty deed he obtained the honour of a triumph. The double-dealing and treachery of the Romans, in their laſt war againſt Carthage, is beyond example. The Carthaginians, ſuſpecting that a ſtorm was gathering againſt them, ſent deputies to Rome for ſecuring peace at any rate. The ſenate, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, were diſpoſed to amicable meaſures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding only hoſtages; and yet, though three hundred hoſtages were delivered without loſs of time, the Roman army landed at Utica. The Carthaginian deputies attended the conſuls there, deſiring to know what more was to be done on their part. They were required to deliver up their arms; which they chearfully did, imagining that they were now certain of peace. Inſtead of which, they received peremptory orders to evacuate the city, with their wives and children; and to take up no habitation within eighty furlongs of the ſea. In

was dethroned by his ſubjects for tyranny. Having repaired to Rome for protection, he ſound means to poiſon the greater part of an hundred Egyptians, his accuſers, and to aſſaſſinate Dion, their chief. And yet theſe crimes, perpetrated in the heart of Rome, were ſuffered to paſs with impunity. But he had ſecured the leading men by bribery, and was protected by Pompey. The following inſtance is, it poſſible, ſtill more groſs: Ptolomy, King of Cyprus, had always been a faithful ally to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. But his gold, jewels, and precious move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, were a tempting bait to the avarice of Rome; and all was confiſcated by a decree of the people, without even a pretext. Money, procured by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy, is not commonly hoarded up; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were no leſs voluptuous than avaricious. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander ab Alexandro mentions the Fanian, Orchian, Didian, Oppian, Cornelian, Ancian, and Julian laws, for repreſſing luxury of dreſs and of eating, all of which proved ineffectual. He adds, that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius had it long at heart to contrive ſome effectual law againſt luxury, which now had ſurpaſſed all bounds; but that he found it impracticable to ſtem the tide. He concludes, that by tacit agreement among a corrupted people all ſumptuary laws were in effect abrogated; and that the Roman people, abandoning themſelves to vice, broke through every reſtraint of morality and religion<note n="k" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 11.</note>.

               <p>Selfiſhneſs, among the rude and illiterate, is rough, blunt, and undiſguiſed. Selfiſhneſs, which, in an opulent kingdom, uſurps the place of patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is ſmooth, refined, and covered with a veil. Pecuniary intereſt, a low object, muſt be covered with the thickeſt veil: ambition, leſs diſnonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is leſs covered: but delicacy, as to charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and love of fame, is ſo honourable, that even the thinneſt veil is thought unneceſſary. Hiſtory juſtifies theſe obſervations. During the proſperity of Greece and Rome, when patriotiſm was the ruling paſſion, no man ever thought of employing a hoſtile wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, but againſt the enemies of his country: ſwords were not worn during peace, nor do we ever read of a private duel. The frequency of duels, in modern times, is no ſlight ſymptom of degeneracy: regardleſs of our country, ſelfiſhneſs is exerted without diſguiſe, when reputation or character is in queſtion; and a nice ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour prompts revenge for every imagined affront, without regard to juſtice. How much more manly and patriotic was the behaviour of Themiſtocles, when inſulted by the Lacedemonian general, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating about the concerns of Greece! <q rend="inline">"Strike,"</q> ſays he, <q rend="inline">"but firſt hear me."</q>

               <p>I fly from a ſcene ſo diſmal, to one that will give no pain. Light is intended by our Maker for action, and darkneſs for reſt. In the fourteenth century, the ſhops in Paris were opened at four in the morning: at preſent, a ſhopkeeper is ſcarce awake at ſeven. The King of France dined at eight in the morning, and retired to his bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at the ſame hour in the evening; an early hour at preſent for public amuſements. The Spaniards adhere to ancient cuſtoms<note n="*" place="bottom">Manners and faſhions ſeldom change, where wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are locked up.</note>. Their King, to this day, dines preciſely at noon, and ſups no leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely at nine in the evening. During the reign of Henry VIII. faſhionable people in England break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted at ſeven in the morning, and dined at ten in the forenoon. In Elizabeth's time, the nobility, gentry, and ſtudents dined at eleven forenoon, and ſupped between five and ſix afternoon. In the reign of Charles II. four in the afternoon was the appointed hour for acting plays: at preſent, even dinner is at a later hour. The King of Yeman, the greateſt prince in Arabia Foelix, dines at nine in the morning, ſups at five after noon, and goes to reſt at eleven. From this ſhort ſpecimen it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the occupations of day-light commence gradually later and later; as if there was a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in polite nations of converting night into day, and day nto night. Nothing happens without a cauſe. Light diſpoſes to action, darkneſs to reſt: the diverſions of day are tournaments, hunting, racing, and ſuch like active exerciſes: the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of night are ſedentary; plays, cards, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Balls are of a mixed nature; partly active,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0032300302:63"/>
in dancing; partly ſedentary, in converſing. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, active exerciſes prevailed among a robuſt and plain people: the milder pleaſures of ſociety prevail as manners refine. Hence it is, that candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light amuſements are now faſhionable in France, and in other poliſhed countries: and when ſuch amuſements are much reliſhed, they baniſh the robuſt exerciſes of the field. Balls, I conjecture, were formerly more frequent in day-light: at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, candle-light is their favourite time; the active part is, at that time, equally agreeable; and the fed ntary part much more ſo.</p>
               <p>Gaming is the vice of idle people. Savages are addicted to gaming; and thoſe of North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, in particular, are fond to diſtraction of a game termed the Platter. A loſing gameſter will ſtrip himſelf to the ſkin; and ſome have been known to ſtake their liberty, though by them valued above all other bleſſings. Negroes in the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt of Guinea will ſtake their wives, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and even themſelves. Tacitus<note n="l" place="bottom">De Moribus Germanorum, cap. 24.</note>, talking of gaming among the Germans, ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Extremo ac noviſſimo jactu de libertate et de corpore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">"For their laſt throw, they ſtake their liberty and life."</q>
                     </note>."</q> The Greeks were an active and ſprightly people, conſtantly engaged in war, or in cultivating the ſine arts. They had no leiſure for gaming, nor any knowledge of it. Happy for them was their ignorance; for no other vice tends more to render men ſelfiſh, diſhoneſt, and, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh ſtyle, diſhonourable. A gameſter, a friend to no man, is a bitter enemy to himſelf. The luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of the preſent age paſs every hour in gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that can be ſpared from ſenſual pleaſure. Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is their excuſe, as it is among ſavages; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0032300302:64"/>
they would in ſome degree be excuſable, were they never actuated by a more diſgraceful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>Writers do not carefully diſtinguiſh particular cuſtoms from general manners. Formerly, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not admitted upon the ſtage in France, Italy, or England. At that very time, none but women were admitted in Spain. From that faſhion it would be raſh to infer, that women have more liberty in Spain, than in the other countries men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; for the contrary is true. In Hindoſtan, eſtabliſhed cuſtom prompts women to burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alive, with the bodies of their deceaſed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; but from that ſingular cuſtom, it would be a falſe inference, that the Hindow women are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more bold, or more affectionate to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, than in other countries. The Polanders, even after they became Chriſtians in the thirteenth century, adhered to the cuſtoms of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Sarmatians; the killing, for example, infants born deformed, and men debilitated by age; which would betoken horrid barbarity, if it were not a ſingular cuſtom. Roman Catholics imagine, that there is no religion in England nor in Holland, becauſe, from a ſpirit of civil liberty, all ſects are there tolerated. The encouragement given to aſſaſſination in Italy, where every church is a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, makes ſtrangers raſhly infer, that the Italians are all aſſaſſins. Writers ſometimes fall into an oppoſite miſtake, attributing to a particular nation, certain manners and cuſtoms common to all nations in one or other period of their progreſs. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by Heraclides Ponticus, as peculiar to the Athamanes, that the men fed the flocks, and the women cultivated the ground. This has been the practice of all nations, in their progreſs from the ſhepherd-ſtate to that of huſbandry; and is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the practice among American ſavages. The
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0032300302:65"/>
ſame author obſerves, as peculiar to the Celtae and Aphitaei, that they leave their doors open without hazard of theft. But that practice is common among all ſavages in the firſt ſtage of ſociety, before the uſe of money is known.</p>
               <p>Hitherto there appears as great uniformity in the progreſs of manners, as can reaſonably be expected among ſo many different nations. There is one exception, extraordinary indeed, if true, which is, the manners of the Caledonians, deſcribed by Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, manners ſo pure and refined, as ſcarce to be equalled in the moſt cultivated nations. Such manners, among a people in the firſt ſtage of ſociety, acquainted with no arts but hunting and making war, would, I acknowledge, be miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: and yet, to ſuppoſe all to be invented by an illiterate ſavage, ſeems little leſs miraculous. One, at firſt view, will, without heſitation, declare the whole a pure fiction; for how is it credible, that a people, rude at preſent, and illiterate, were, in the infancy of their ſociety, highly refined in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and manners? And yet, upon a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate inſpection, many weighty conſiderations oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to balance that opinion.</p>
               <p>From a thouſand circumſtances it appears, that the works of Oſſian are not a late production. They are compoſed in an old dialect of the Celtic tongue; and as, till of late, they were known only in the Highlands of Scotland, the author muſt have been a Caledonian. The tranſlator<note n="m" place="bottom">Mr. Macpherſon.</note> ſaw, in the Iſle of Sky, the firſt four books of the poem Fingal, written in a fair hand, on vellum, and bearing date in the year 1403. The natives believe that poem to be very ancient: every perſon has paſſages of it by heart, tranſmitted by memory from their forefathers. Their dogs bear commonly the name of Luath, Bran, &amp;c. mentioned in theſe poems, as our dogs
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0032300302:66"/>
do of Pompey and Caeſar<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Iſle of Sky, the ruins of the caſtle of Dunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caich, upon an inacceſſible rock hanging over the ſea, are ſtill viſible. That caſtle, as vouched by tradition, belonged to Cuchullin, Lord of that Iſle, whoſe hiſtory is recorded in the Poem of Fingal. Upon the green be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the caſtle there is a great ſtone, to which, according to the ſame tradition, his dog Luath was chained.</note>. Many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars might be mentioned; but theſe are ſufficient to evince, that the work muſt have exiſted at leaſt three or four centuries. And, taking that for granted, I proceed to certain conſiderations tending to evince, that the manners deſcribed in Oſſian were Caledonian manners, and not a pure fiction. And after peruſing with attention theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am not afraid, that even the moſt incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous will continue altogether unſhaken.</p>
               <p>It is a noted and well-founded obſervation, That manners are never painted to the life by any one to whom they are not familiar. It is not difficult to draw the outlines of imaginary manners; but to fill up the picture with all the variety of tints that manners aſſume in different ſituations, uniting all in one entire whole,—<q rend="inline">"hic labor, hoc opus eſt."</q> Yet the manners here ſuppoſed to be invented, are delineated in a variety of incidents, of ſentiments, of images, and of alluſions, making one entire picture, without once deviating into the ſlighteſt incongruity. Every ſcene in Oſſian relates to hunting, to fighting, and to love, the ſole occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of men, in the original ſtate of ſociety: there is not a ſingle image, ſimile, nor alluſion, but what is borrowed from that ſtate, without a jarring circumſtance. Suppoſing all to be mere invention, is it not amazing to find no mention of Highland Clans, nor of any name now in uſe? Is it not ſtill more amazing, that there is not the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0032300302:67"/>
ſlighteſt hint of the Chriſtian religion, not even in a metaphor or alluſion? Is it not equally amazing, that, in a work where deer's fleſh is frequently mentioned, and a curious method of roaſting it, there ſhould not be a word of fiſh as food, which is ſo common in later times? Very few High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers know that their forefathers did not eat fiſh; and, ſuppoſing it to be known, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire attention more than human, never once to mention it. Can it be ſuppoſed, that a modern writer could be ſo conſtantly on his guard, as never to mention corn, nor cattle? In a ſtory ſo ſcanty of poetical images, the ſedentary life of a ſhepherd, and the induſtry of a huſbandman, would make a capital figure: the cloven foot would ſomewhere appear. And yet, in all the works of Oſſian, there is no mention of agriculture; and but a ſlight hint of a herd of cattle in one or two alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I willingly give all advantages to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. Suppoſing the author of Oſſian to be a late writer, embelliſhed with every refinement of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern education: yet, even upon that ſuppoſition, he is a miracle, far from being equalled by any other author, ancient or modern.</p>
               <p>But difficulties multiply, when it is taken into the account, that the poems of Oſſian have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted three or four centuries at leaſt. Our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, at preſent, are rude and illiterate; and were, in fact, little better than ſavages, at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod mentioned. Now, to hold the manners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in that work to be imaginary, is, in effect, to hold, that they were invented by a Highland ſavage, acquainted with the rude manners of his country, but utterly unacquainted with every other ſyſtem of manners. From what ſource did he draw the refined manners ſo deliciouſly painted by him? Suppoſing him to have been a traveller, of which we have not the ſlighteſt hint, the manners, at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0032300302:68"/>
that period, of France, of Italy, and of other neighbouring nations, were little leſs barbarous than thoſe of his own country. I can diſcover no ſource, other than direct inſpiration. In a word, whoever ſeriouſly believes the manners of Oſſian to be fictitious, may well ſay, with the religious enthuſiaſt, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Credo, quia impoſſibile eſt:"</q> [I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, becauſe it is impoſſible.]</p>
               <p>But further: The uncommon talents of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this work will chearfully be acknowledged by every reader of taſte: he certainly was a great maſter in his way. Now, whether the work be late, or compoſed four centuries ago, a man of ſuch talents inventing an hiſtorical fable, and laying the ſcene of action among ſavages in the hunter-ſtate, would naturally frame a ſyſtem of manners, the beſt ſuited, in his opinion, to that ſtate. What then could tempt him to adopt a ſyſtem of manners ſo oppoſite to any notion he could frame of ſavage manners? The abſurdity is ſo groſs, that we are forced, however reluctantly, to believe, that theſe manners are not fictitious; but, in reality, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his country, coloured, perhaps, or a little heightened, according to the privilege of an epic poet. And, once admitting that fact, there can be no heſitation in aſcribing that work to Oſſian, ſon of Fingal, whoſe name it bears: we have no better evidence for the authors of ſeveral Greek and Roman books. Upon the ſame evidence we muſt believe, that Oſſian lived in the reign of the Emperor Caracalla, of whom frequent mention is made under the deſignation of Caracul the Great King; at which period the ſhepherd ſtate was ſcarce known in Caledonia, and huſbandry not at all. Had he lived ſo late as the twelfth century, when there were flocks and herds in that country, and ſome ſort of agriculture, a poet of genius,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0032300302:69"/>
ſuch as Oſſian undoubtedly was, would have drawn from theſe his fineſt images.</p>
               <p>The foregoing conſiderations, I am perſuaded, would not fail to convert the moſt incredulous, were it not for a conſequence extremely impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that a people, little better at preſent than ſavages, were, in their primitive hunter-ſtate, highly refined; for ſuch Oſſian deſcribes them. And yet it is not leſs improbable, that ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould be invented by an illiterate Highland bard. Let a man chuſe either ſide, the difficulty cannot be ſolved, but by a miracle. What ſhall we conclude upon the whole? for the mind cannot for ever remain in ſuſpenſe. As dry reaſoning has left us in a dilemma, taſte, perhaps, and feeling may extricate us. May not the caſe be here as in real painting? A portrait drawn from fancy may reſemble the human viſage; but ſuch peculiarity of countenance and expreſſion, as ſerves to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a certain perſon from every other, is always wanting. Preſent a portrait to a man of taſte, and he will be at no loſs to ſay, whether it be copied from the life, or be the product of fancy. If Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an paint from fancy, the cloven foot will appear: but if his portraits be complete, ſo as to expreſs every peculiarity of character, why ſhould we doubt of their being copied from life? In that view, the reader, I am hopeful, will not think his time thrown away in examining ſome of Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's ſtriking pictures. I ſee not any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource.</p>
               <p>Love of fame is painted by Oſſian as the ruling paſſion of his countrymen, the Caledonians. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors are every where deſcribed as eſteeming it their chief happineſs to be recorded in the ſongs of the bards: that feature is never wanting in any of Oſſian's heroes. Take the following inſtances: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"King of the roaring Strumon, ſaid the riſing joy

One may diſcover the manners of a nation from the figure their women make. Among ſavages, women are treated like ſlaves; and they acquire not the dignity that belongs to the ſex, till manners be conſiderably refined. According to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners above deſcribed, women ought to have made a conſiderable figure among the ancient Caledoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Let us examine Oſſian upon that ſubject, in order to judge whether he carries on the ſame tone of manners to every particular. That women were highly regarded appears from the following paſſages: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Daughter of the hand of ſnow! I was not ſo mournful and blind, I was not ſo dark and forlorn, when Everallin loved me, Everallin with the dark-brown hair, the white-boſomed love of Cormac.

               <p>The Gallic Celtae undoubtedly carried with them their manners and cuſtoms to Britain, and ſpread them gradually from ſouth to north. And as the Caledonians, inhabiting a mountainous country in the northern parts of the iſland, had little commerce with other nations, they preſerved long in purity many Celtic cuſtoms, particularly that of retaining

bards. All the chieftains had bards in their pay, whoſe province it was to compoſe ſongs in praiſe of their anceſtors, and to accompany thoſe ſongs with the harp. This entertainment enflamed their love for war, and at the ſame time ſoftened their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which, as Strabo reports, were naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and void of malignity. It had beſide a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful influence in forming virtuous manners: the bards, in praiſing deceaſed heroes, would naturally ſelect virtuous actions, which make the beſt figure in heroic poetry, and tend the moſt to illuſtrate the hero of their ſong: vice may be flattered; but praiſe is never willingly nor ſucceſsfully beſtowed upon any atchievement but what is virtuous and heroic. It is accordingly obſerved by Ammianus Marcellinus<note n="x" place="bottom">Lib. 15.</note>, that the bards inculcated in their ſongs virtue and actions worthy of praiſe. The bards, who were in high eſtimation, became great proficients in poetry; of which we have a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous inſtance in the works of Oſſian. Their capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal compoſitions were diligently ſtudied by thoſe of their own order, and much admired by all. The ſongs of the bards, accompanied with the harp, made a deep impreſſion on the young warrior, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſome into heroes, and promoted virtue in every hearer<note n="*" place="bottom">Polydore Virgil ſays, <q rend="inline">Hiberni ſunt muſicae peritiſſimi.</q>—[in Engliſh thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Iriſh are moſt ſkilful in muſic."</q>—Ireland was peopled from Britain; and the muſic of that country muſt have been derived from Britiſh bards. The Welſh bards were the great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of independence; and in particular promoted an obſtinate reſiſtance to Edward I. when he carried his arms into Wales. And hence the tradition, that the Welſh bards were all ſlaughtered by that King.</note>. Another circumſtance concurred to form Caledonian manners, common to them with every nation in the firſt ſtage of ſociety; which is,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0032300302:93"/>
that avarice was unknown among them. People in that ſtage, ignorant of habitual wants, and having a ready ſupply of all that nature requires, have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle notion of property, and not the ſlighteſt notion of accumulating the goods of fortune; and for that reaſon are always found honeſt and diſintereſted. With reſpect to the female ſex, who make an illuſtrious figure in Oſſian's poems, if they were ſo eminent both for courage and beauty as they are repreſented by the beſt authors, it is no wonder that they are painted by Oſſian as objects of love the moſt pure and refined. Nor ought it to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, that the ſoft and delicate notes of the harp have a tendency to purify manners, and to refine love.</p>
               <p>Whether the cauſes here aſſigned of Celtic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be fully adequate may well admit of a doubt; but if authentic hiſtory be relied on, we can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no doubt, that the manners of the Gallic and Britiſh Celiae, including the Caledonians, were ſuch as are above deſcribed. And as the manners aſcribed by Oſſian to his conntrymen the Caledoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are in every particular conformable to thoſe now mentioned, it clearly follows, that Oſſian was no inventor, but drew his pictures of manners from real life. This is made highly probable from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic evidence, the ſame that is ſo copiouſly urged above: and now by authentic hiſtory that probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is ſo much heightened as ſcarce to leave room for a doubt.</p>
               <p>Our preſent highlanders are but a ſmall part of the inhabitants of Britain; and they have been ſinking in their importance, from the time that arts and ſciences made a figure, and peaceable manners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. And yet in that people are diſcernible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remaining features of their forefathers the Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians. They have to this day a diſpoſition to war, and when diſciplined make excellent ſoldiers,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0032300302:94"/>
ſober, active, and obedient. They are eminently hoſpitable; and the character given by Strabo of the Gallic Celiae, that they were innocent, and devoid of malignity, is to them perfectly applicable. That they have not the magnanimity and heroiſm of the Caledonians, is eaſily accounted for. The Caledonians were a free and independent people, unawed by any ſuperior power, and living under the mild government of their own chieftains: compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their forefathers, the preſent highlanders make a very inconſiderable figure: their country is barren, and at any rate is but a ſmall part of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent kingdom; and their language deprives them of intercourſe with their poliſhed neighbours.</p>
               <p>There certainly never happened in literature a diſcovery more extraordinary than the works of Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. To lay the ſcene of action among hunters in the firſt ſtage of ſociety, and to beſtow upon ſuch a people a ſyſtem of manners that would do honour to the moſt poliſhed ſtate, ſeemed at firſt an ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived forgery. But if a forgery, why ſo bold and improbable? why not invent manners more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to the ſavage ſtate? And as at any rate the work has greater merit, why did the author conceal himſelf? Theſe conſiderations rouſed my attention, and produced the foregoing diſquiſition; which I finiſhed, without imagining that any more light could be obtained. But after a long interval, a thought ſtruck me, that as the Caledonians formerly were much connected with the Scandinavians, the manners of the latter might probably give light in the preſent enquiry. I chearfully ſpread my ſails in a wide ocean, not without hopes of importing precious merchandiſe. Many volumes did I turn over of Scandinavian hiſtory; eſpecially where the manners of the inhabitants in the firſt ſtage of ſociety are delineated; and now I proceed to preſent my readers with the fruits of my labour.</p>

               <p>Much efficacy is above aſcribed to the ſongs of Caledonian bards; and with ſatisfaction I find my obſervations juſtified in every Scandinavian hiſtory. The Kings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, are repreſented in ancient chronicles as conſtantly attended with ſcalds or bards; who were treated with great reſpect, eſpecially by princes diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in war. Harold Harfager at his feaſts placed them above all his other officers; and employed them in negotiations of the greateſt importance. The poetic art, held in great eſtimation, was cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by men of the firſt rank. Rogvald, Earl of Orkney, paſſed for an able poet. King Regnar was diſtinguiſhed in poetry, no leſs than in war. It was the proper province of bards in Scandinavia, as in other countries, to celebrate in odes the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of deceaſed heroes. They were frequently employed in animating the troops before a battle. Hacon, Earl of Norway, in his famous engagement againſt the warriors of Iomſburg, had five celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poets, each of whom ſung an ode to the ſoldiers ready to engage. Saxo Grammaticus, deſcribing a battle between Waldemar and Sueno, mentions a ſcald belonging to the former, who, advancing to the front of the army, reproached the latter in a pathetic ode as the murderer of his own father.</p>
               <p>The odes of the Scandinavian bards have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar energy; which is not difficult to be accounted
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0032300302:97"/>
for. The propenſity of the Scandinavians to war, their love of glory, their undaunted courage, and their warlike exploits, naturally produced elevated ſentiments, and an elevated tone of language; both of which were diſplayed in celebrating heroic deeds. Take the following inſtances. The firſt is from the Edda, which contains the birth and genealogy of their gods. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The giant Rymer arrives from the eaſt, carried in a chariot: the great ſerpent, rolling himſelf furiouſly in the waters, liſteth up the ſea. The eagle ſereams, and with his horrid beak tears the dead. The veſſel of the gods is ſet afloat. The black prince of ſire iſſues from the ſouth, ſurrounded with flames: the ſwords of the gods beam like the ſun: ſhaken are the rocks, and fall to pieces. The female giants wander about weeping: men in crowds tread the paths of death. Heaven is ſplit aſunder, the ſun darkened, and the earth ſunk in fhe ocean. The ſhining ſtars vaniſh: the fire rages the world draws to an end; and the flame aſcending licks the vault of heaven. From the boſom of the waves an earth emerges, clothed with lovely green: the floods retire: the fields produce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out culture: misfortunes are baniſhed from the world. Balder and his brother, gods of war, return to inhabit the ruined palace of Odin. A palace more reſplendent than the ſun riſes now to view; adorned with a roof of gold: there good men ſhall inhabit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and live in joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure through all ages."</q> In a collection of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hiſtorical monuments of the north, publiſhed by Biorner, a learned Swede, there is the following paſſage. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Grunder, perceiving Grymer ruſhing furiouſly through oppoſing battalions, cries aloud, Thou alone remaineſt to engage with me in ſingle combat. It is now thy turn to feel the keenneſs of my ſword. Their ſabres, like dark

and threatening clouds, hang dreadful in the air. Grymer's weapon darts down like a thunderbolt: their ſwords furiouſly ſtrike: they are bathed in gore. Grymer cleaves the caſque of his enemy, hews his armour in pieces, and pours the light into his boſom. Grunder ſinks to the ground; and Grymer gives a dreadful ſhout of triumph."</q> This picture is done with a maſterly hand. The capital circumſtances are judiciouſly ſelected; and the narration is compact and rapid. Indulge me with a moment's pauſe to compare this picture with one or two in Oſſian's manner. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As autumn's dark ſtorm pour froms two echoing hills; ſo to each other approach the heroes. As from high rocks two dark ſtreams meet, and mix and roar on the plain; ſo meet Lochlin and Innis-fail, loud, rough, and dark in battle. Chief mixes his ſtrokes with chief, and man with man; ſteel ſounds on ſteel, helmets are cleft on high. Blood burſts, and ſmoaks around. Strings murmur on the poliſhed yew. Darts ruſh along the ſky. Spears fall like ſparks of flame that gild the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my face of night. As the noiſe of the troubled ocean when roll the waves on high, as the laſt peal of thundering heaven, ſuch is the noiſe of battle. Though Cormac's hundred bards were there, feeble were the voice of an hundred bards to ſend the deaths to future times; for many were the heroes who fell, and wide poured the blood of the valiant."</q> Again, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"As roll a thouſand waves to the rocks, ſo came on Swaran's hoſt: as meets a rock a thouſand waves, ſo Innis-fail met Swaran. The voice of death is heard all around, and mixes with the ſound of ſhields. Each hero is a pillar of darkneſs, and the ſword a beam of fire in his hand. From wing to wing echoes the field, like a hundred hammers that riſe by turns on the red ſun of the furnace. Who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0032300302:99"/>
are thoſe on Lena's heath, ſo gloomy and dark? they are like two clouds, and their ſwords lighten above. Who is it but Oſſian's ſon, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne chief of Erin?"</q> Theſe two deſcriptions make a deeper impreſſion, and ſwell the heart more than the former: they are more poetical by ſhort ſimiles finely interwoven; and the images are far more lofty. And yet Oſſian's chief talent is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, in which Scandinavian bards are far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or: in the generoſity, tenderneſs, and humanity of his ſentiments, he has not a rival.</p>
               <p>The ancient Scandinavians were undoubtedly a barbarous people compared with the ſouthern nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Europe; but that they were far from being groſs ſavages, may be gathered from a poem ſtill extant, named HAVAMAAL; or, The ſublime Diſcourſe of Odin.

               <p>Hitherto the manners of the Scandinavians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, in many capital circumſtances, thoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated in the works of Oſſian.

Among other ſavage nations, they are held to be beings of an inferior rank; and as ſuch are treated with very little reſpect: in Oſſian they make an illuſtrious figure, and are highly regarded by the men. I have not words to expreſs my ſatisfaction, when I diſcovered, that anciently among the barbarous Scandinavians, the female ſex made a figure no leſs illuſtrious.

It is a fact aſcertained by many writers, That women in the north of Europe were eminent for reſolution and courage. Caeſar, in the firſt book of his Commentaries, deſcribing a battle he fought with the Helvetii, ſays, that the women, with a warlike ſpirit, exhorted their huſbands to perſiſt, and placed the waggons in a line, to prevent their flight. Florus and Tacitus mention that ſeveral battles of thoſe barbarous nations were renewed by their women, preſenting their naked boſoms, and declaring their abhorrence of captivity. Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Vopiſcus, writing of Proculus Caeſar, ſays, that an hundred Samaritan virgins were taken in battle. The Longobard women, when many of their huſbands were cut off in a battle, took up arms, and obtained the victory<note n="d" place="bottom">Paulus Diaconus.</note>. The females of the Galactophagi, a Scythian tribe, were as warlike as the males, and went often with them to war<note n="e" place="bottom">Nicolaus Damaſcenus.</note>. In former times, many women in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark applied themſelves to arms<note n="f" place="bottom">Saxo Grammaticus.</note>. Jornandes deſcribes the women of the Goths as full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and trained to arms like the men. Joannes Magnus, Archbiſhop of Upſal, ſays the ſame; and mentions in particular an expedition of the Goths to invade a neighbouring country, in which more women went along with the men than were left at home<note n="g" place="bottom">Book 1.</note>. Several Scandinavian women exerciſed piracy<note n="h" place="bottom">Olaus Magnus.</note>. The Cimbri were always attended with their wives, even in their diſtant expeditions, and were more afraid of their reproaches, than of the blows of the enemy. The Goths, compelled by famine to ſurrender to Beliſarius the city of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0032300302:102"/>
were bitterly reproached by their wives for cowardice<note n="i" place="bottom">Procopius, Hiſtoria Gothica, lib. 2.</note>. In a battle between Regner, King of Denmark, and Fro, King of Sweden, many women took part with the former, Langertha in particular, who fought with her hair flowing about her ſhoulders. Regner, being victorious, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who that woman was, who had behaved ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly; and finding her to be a virgin of noble birth, he took her to wife. He afterward divorced her, in order to make way for a daughter of the King of Sweden. Regner being unhappily engaged in a civil war with Harald, who aſpired to the throne of Denmark, Langertha, overlooking her wrongs, brought from Norway a body of men to aſſiſt her huſband; and behaved ſo gallantly, that, in the opinion of all, Regner was indebted to her for the victory.</p>
               <p>To find women, in no inconſiderable portion of the globe, dropping their timid nature, and rivalling men in their capital property of courage, is a ſingular phoenomenon. That this phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non muſt have had an adequate cauſe, is certain; but of that cauſe, it is better to acknowledge our utter ignorance, however mortifying, than to ſqueeze out conjectures that will not bear exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>

In Scandinavia, women are ſaid to have been ſkilful in magic arts, as well as men. Tacitus informs us, that the Germans had no other phyſicians but their women.

               <p>We have the authority of Procopius<note n="l" place="bottom">Hiſtoria Gothica, lib. 3.</note>, that the women in thoſe countries were remarkable for beauty, and that thoſe of the Goths and Vandals were the fineſt that ever had been ſeen in Italy; and we have the authority of Crantz, that chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in high eſtimation among the Danes, Swedes, and other Scandinavians. When theſe facts are added to thoſe above-mentioned, it will not be thought ſtrange, that love between the ſexes, even among that rude people, was a pure and elevated paſſion. That it was in fact ſuch, is certain, if hiſtory can be credited, or the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of a people expreſſed in their poetical compoſitions. I begin with the latter, as evidence the moſt to be relied on. The ancient poems of Scandinavia contain the warmeſt expreſſions of love and regard for the female ſex. In an ode of King Regner Lodbrog, a very ancient poem, we find the following ſentiments: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"We fought with ſwords upon a promontory of England, when I ſaw ten thouſand of my foes rolling in the duſt. A dew of blood diſtilled from our ſwords: the arrows, that flew in ſearch of the helmet, hiſſed through the air. The pleaſure of that day was like the claſping a fair virgin in my arms."</q> Again, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"A young man ſhould march early to the conflict of arms; in which conſiſts the glory of the warrior. He who aſpires to the love of a miſtreſs, ought to be dauntleſs in the claſh of ſwords."</q> Theſe Hyperboreans, it would appear, had early learned to combine the ideas of love and of military proweſs; which is ſtill more conſpicuous in an ode of Harald the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, of a later date. That prince, who made a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0032300302:105"/>
figure in the middle of the eleventh century, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed all the ſeas of the north, and made pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical incurſions even upon the coaſts of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean. In this ode he complains, that the glory he had acquired made no impreſſion on Eliſſir, daughter to Jariſlas, King of Ruſſia. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I have made the tour of Sicily. My brown veſſel, full of mariners, made a ſwift progreſs. My courſe, I thought, would never ſlacken—and yet a Ruſſian maiden ſcorns me. The troops or Drontheim, which I attacked in my youth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ours in number. Terrible was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict: I left their young king dead on the field—and yet a Ruſſian maiden ſcorns me. Eight exerciſes I can perform: I fight valiantly: firm is my ſeat on horſeback: inured I am to ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: ſwift is my motion on ſcates: I dart the lance: I am ſkilful at the oar—and yet a Ruſſian maiden ſcorns me. Can ſhe deny, this young and lovely maiden, that near a city in the ſouth I joined battle, and left behind me laſting monuments of my exploits?—and yet a Ruſſian maiden ſcorns me. My birth was in the high country of Norway, famous for archers: but ſhips were my delight; and, far from the habitations of men, I have traverſed the ſeas from north to ſouth—and yet a Ruſſian maiden ſcorns me."</q> in the very ancient poem of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamaal, mentioned above, there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of love to the fair-ſex. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He who would gain the love of a maiden, muſt addreſs her with ſmooth ſpeeches, and ſhowy gifts. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires good ſenſe to be a ſkilful lover."</q> Again, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If I aſpire to the love of the chaſteſt virgin, I can bend her mind, and make her yield to my deſires."</q> The ancient Scandinavian chronicles preſent often to our view young warriors endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to acquire the favour of their miſtreſſes,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0032300302:106"/>
by boaſting of their accompliſhments, ſuch as their dexterity in ſwimming and ſcating, their talent in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, their ſkill in cheſs, and their knowing all the ſtars by name. Mallet, in the Introduction to his Hiſtory of Denmark, mentions many ancient Scandinavian novels, that turn upon love and heroiſm. Theſe may be juſtly held as authentic evidence of the manners of the people: it is common to invent facts; but it is not common to attempt the invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manners.</p>
               <p>It is an additional proof of the great regard paid to women in Scandinavia, that in Edda, the Scandinavian Bible, female deities make as great a figure as male deities.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to the manners deſcribed, we find it univerſally admitted among the ancient Scandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navians, that beauty ought to be the reward of courage and military ſkill. A warrior was thought intitled to demand in marriage any young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, even of the higheſt rank, if he overcame his rivals in ſingle combat: nor was it thought any hardſhip on the young lady to be yielded to the victor. The ladies were not always of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the ſtouteſt fighter is not always the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt fellow, nor the moſt engaging. And in the Hiſtories of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, many inſtances are related, of men generouſly interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſcue young beauties from brutes, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of every accompliſhment but ſtrength and boldneſs. Such ſtories have a fabulous air; and many of them probably are mere fables. Some of them, however, have a ſtrong appearance of truth: men are introduced, who make a figure in the real hiſtory of the country; and many circumſtances are related, that make links in the chain of that hiſtory. Take the following ſpecimen: The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Frotho, King of Denmark, commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0032300302:107"/>
to demand in marriage the daughter of a King of the Hunns, were feaſted for three days, as the cuſtom was in ancient times; and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the young Princeſs, ſhe rejected the offer: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Becauſe,"</q> ſays ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"your King has acquired no reputation in war, but paſſes his time effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately at home."</q> In Biorner's Collection of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtorical Monuments, mentioned above, there is the following hiſtory: Charles, King of Sweden, kept on foot an army of choſen men. His Queen had borne him a daughter, named Ingue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerda, whoſe lively and graceful accompliſhments were admired ſtill more than her birth and fortune. The breaſt of the King overflowed with felicity. Grymer, a youth of noble birth, knew to dye his ſword in the blood of his enemies, to run over craggy mountains, to wreſtle, to play at cheſs, and to trace the motions of the ſtars. He ſtudied to ſhew his ſkill in the apartment of the damſels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lovely Inguegerda. At length he ventured to open his mind. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Wilt thou, O fair Princeſs! accept of me for a huſband, if I obtain the King's conſent?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Go,"</q> ſays ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate my father."</q> The courtly youth, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully addreſſing the King, ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O King, give me in marriage thy beautiful daughter."</q> He anſwered ſternly, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Thou haſt learned to handle thy arms: thou haſt acquired ſome honourable diſtinctions: but haſt thou ever gained a victory, or given a banquet to ſavage beaſts that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in blood?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Where ſhall I go, O King! that I may dye my ſword in crimſon, and render myſelf worthy of being thy ſon-in-law?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hialmar, ſon of Harec,"</q> ſaid the King, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"who governs Biarmland, has become ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible by a keen ſword: the firmeſt ſhields he hews in pieces, and loads his followers with booty. Go, and prove thy valour, by attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0032300302:108"/>
that hero: cauſe him to bite the duſt, and Inguegerda ſhall be thy reward."</q> Grymer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his fair miſtreſs, ſaluted her with ardent looks of love. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What anſwer haſt thou received from the King?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"To obtain thee I muſt deprive the fierce Hialmar of life."</q> Ingue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerda exclaimed with grief, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Alas! my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath devoted thee to death."</q> Grymer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a troop of brave warriors, eager to follow him. They launch their veſſels into the wide ocean: they unfurl their ſails, which catch the ſpringing gale: the ſhrowds rattle: the waves foam, and daſh againſt the prows: they ſteer their numerous veſſels to the ſhore of Gothland; bent to glut the hungry raven, and to gorge the wolf with prey. Thus landed Grymer on Gothland: and thus did a beauteous maiden occaſion the death of many heroes. Hialmar demanded who the ſtrangers were. Grymer told his name; adding, that he had ſpent the ſummer in queſt of him. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"May your arrival,"</q> replied Hialmar, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"be fortunate; and may health and honour attend you! You ſhall partake of my gold, with the unmixed juice of the grape. Thy offers, ſaid Grymer, I dare not accept. Prepare for battle; and let us haſten to give a banquet to beaſts of prey. Hialmar laid hold of his white cuiraſs, his ſword, and his buckler. Grymer, with a violent blow of his ſabre, transfixes Hialmar's ſhield, and cuts off his left hand. Hialmar, enraged, brandiſhes his ſword, and ſtriking off Grymer's helmet and cuiraſs, pierces his breaſt and ſides; an effuſion of blood following the wounds. Grymer, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſabre with both hands, lays Hialmar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground; and he himſelf ſinks down upon the dead body of his adverſary. He was put on ſhip-board, and ſeemed to be at the laſt period of life when he landed. The diſtreſſed Princeſs
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0032300302:109"/>
undertook his cure, and reſtored him to health. They were married with great ſolemnity, and the beauteous bride of Grymer filled the heart of her hero with unfading joy."</q>

               <p>According to the rude manners of thoſe times, a lover did not always wait for the conſent of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Joannes Magnus, Archbiſhop of Upſal, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, in his hiſtory of the Goths, that raviſhing of women was of old no leſs frequent among the Scandinavians than among the Greeks. He relates, that Gram, ſon to the King of Denmark, carried off the King of Sweden's daughter, whoſe beauty was celebrated in verſes exiſting even in his time. Another inſtance he gives, of Nicolaus King of Denmark<note n="m" place="bottom">Book 18.</note>, who courted Uluilda, a noble and beautiful Norvegian lady, and obtained her conſent. Nothing remained but the celebration of the nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, when ſhe was carried off by Suercher, King of Sweden. We have the authority of Saxo Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus, that Skiold, one of the firſt Kings of Denmark, fought a duel for a beautiful young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and obtained her for a wife. That author relates many duels of the ſame kind. It was indeed common among the Scandinavians, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtians, to fight for a wife, and to carry off the deſired object by force of arms. No cauſe of war between neighbouring kings was more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Fridlevus King of Denmark ſent a ſolemn embaſſy to Haſmundus King of Norway, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in marriage his daughter. Haſmundus had a rooted averſion to the Danes, who had done much miſchief in his country. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Go,"</q> ſays he to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"and demand a wife where you are leſs hated than in Norway."</q> The young lady, who had no averſion to the match, intreated leave to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0032300302:110"/>
ſpeak. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"You ſeem,"</q> ſaid ſhe, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"not to conſult the good of your kingdom in rejecting ſo potent a ſon-in-law, who can carry by force what he is now applying for by intreaties."</q> The father however continuing obſtinate, diſmiſſed the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. Fridlevus ſent other ambaſſadors, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his intreaties for a favourable anſwer. Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus ſaid, that one refuſal might be thought ſufficient; and in a fit of paſſion put the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to death. Fridlevus invaded Norway with a potent army; and, after a deſperate battle, carried off the lady in triumph.</p>
               <p>The figure that women made in the north of Europe by their courage, their beauty, and their chaſtity, could not fail to produce mutual eſteem and love between the ſexes: nor could that love fail to be purified into the moſt tender affection, when their rough manners were ſmoothed in the progreſs of ſociety. If love between the ſexes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in Lapland as much as any where, which is vouched by Scheffer in his hiſtory of that country, it muſt be for a reaſon very different from that now mentioned. The males in Lapland, who are great cowards, have no reaſon to deſpiſe the females for their timidity; and in every country where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men equal the men, mutual eſteem and affection naturally take place. Two Lapland odes commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to us by the author mentioned, leave no doubt of this fact, being full of the tendereſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that love can inſpire. The following is a literal tranſlation.</p>

               <p>In the Scandinavian manners here deſcribed is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a ſtriking reſemblance to thoſe deſcribed by Oſſian. And as ſuch were the manners of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavians in the firſt ſtage of ſociety, it no longer remains a wonder, that the manners of Caledonia ſhould be equally pure in the ſame early period. And now every argument above urged in favour of Oſſian as a genuine hiſtorian has its full weight, without the leaſt counterpoiſe. It is true, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonian manners appear from Oſſian to have been ſtill more poliſhed and refined than thoſe of Scandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navia; but that difference may have proceeded from many cauſes, which time has buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0032300302:114"/>
I make no apology for inſiſting ſo largely on Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinavian manners; for they tend remarkably to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the credit of Oſſian, and conſequently to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fact extremely intereſting, that our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were by no means ſuch barbarians as they are commonly held to be. All the inhabitants of Britain were of Celtic extraction; and we have reaſon to believe, that the manners of Caledonia were the manners of every part of the iſland, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the plains were enſlaved by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. The only circumſtance peculiar to the Caledonians, is their mountainous ſituation: being leſs expoſed to the oppreſſion of foreigners, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removed from commerce, they did longer than their ſouthern neighbours preſerve their manners pure and untainted.</p>
               <p>I have all along conſidered the poems of Oſſian merely in an hiſtorical view. In the view of criticiſm they have been examined by a writer of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed taſte<note n="n" place="bottom">Doctor Blair, profeſſor of Rhetoric in the college of Edinburgh.</note>; and however bold to enter a field where he hath reaped laurels, I imagine that there ſtill remain ſome trifles for me to glean. Two of theſe poems, Fingal and Temora, are regular epic po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems; and perhaps the ſingle inſtances of epic poetry moulded into the form of an opera. We have in theſe two poems both the Recitativo and Aria of an Italian opera; dropped indeed in the tranſlation, from difficulty of imitation. Oſſian's poems were all of them compoſed with a view to muſic; though in the long poems mentioned it is probable, that the airs only were accompanied with the harp, the recitative being left to the voice. The poems of Oſſian are ſingular in another reſpect, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the only work now remaining that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0032300302:115"/>
in the hunter-ſtate. Some ſongs of that early period may poſſibly be remaining, but nothing like a regular work. One may advance a ſtep farther, and pronounce, with a high degree of probability, that Fingal and Temora are the only epic poems that ever were compoſed in that ſtate. How great muſt have been the talents of the author, beſet with every obſtruction to genius, the manners of his country alone excepted; a cold unhoſpitable cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, with ſuch deformity on the face of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as ſcarce to afford a pleaſing object; and he himſelf abſolutely illiterate! One, advancing ſtill farther, may venture boldly to affirm, that ſuch a poem as Fingal or Temora never was compoſed in any other part of the world under ſuch diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Tho' permanent manners enter not regularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſent ſketch, I am however tempted to add a few words concerning the influence of ſoil upon the diſpoſition of man, in order to ſhow the wiſdom of Providence, which fits the ground we tread on, not only for ſupplying our wants, but for improving our manners. The ſtupidity of the inhabitants of New Holland, mentioned above, is occaſioned by the barrenneſs of their ſoil, yielding nothing that can be food for man or beaſt. Day and night they watch the ebb of the tide, in order to dig ſmall fiſh out of the ſand; and ſleep in the intervals, without an hour to ſpare for any other occupation. People in that condition muſt for ever remain ignorant and brutiſh. Were all the earth barren like New Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, all men would be ignorant and brutiſh, like the inhabitants of New Holland. On the other hand, were every portion of this earth naturally ſo fertile as ſpontaneouſly to feed all its inhabitants, which is the golden age figured by poets, what would follow? Upon the former ſuppoſition, man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0032300302:116"/>
would be a meagre, patient, and timid animal: upon the latter ſuppoſition, he would be pampered, lazy, and effeminate. In both caſes, he would be ſtupidly ignorant, and incapable of any manly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether of mind or body. But the ſoil of our earth is more wiſely accommodated to man, its chief inhabitant. Taking it general, it is neither ſo fertile as to ſuperſede labour, nor ſo barren as to require our whole labour. The laborious occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hunting for food produced originally ſome degree of induſtry: and though all the induſtry of man was at firſt neceſſary for procuring food, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and habitation; yet the ſoil, by ſkill in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, came to produce plenty with leſs labour, which to ſome afforded ſpare time for thinking of conveniences. A habit of induſtry thus acquired excited many to beſtow their leiſure-hours upon the arts, proceeding from uſeful arts to fine arts, and from theſe to the ſciences. Wealth, accumulated by induſtry, has a wonderful influence upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: feuds and war, the offspring of wealth, call forth into action friendſhip, courage, heroiſm, and every ſocial virtue, as well as many ſelfiſh vices. How like brutes do we paſs our time, without once reflecting on the conduct of Providence operating even under our feet!</p>
               <p>Diverſity of manners, at the ſame time, enters into the plan of Providence, as well as diverſity of talents, of feelings, and of opinions. Our Maker hath given us a taſte for variety; and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided objects in plenty for its gratification. Some ſoils, naturally fertile, require little labour: ſome ſoils, naturally barren, require the extremity of labour. But the advantages of ſuch a ſoil are more than ſufficient to counterbalance its barrenneſs: the inhabitants are ſober, induſtrious, vigorous; and conſequently courageous, ſo far as courage depends
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0032300302:117"/>
on bodily ſtrength<note n="*" place="bottom">That a barren country is a great ſpur to induſtry, appears from Venice and Genoa in Italy. Nuremberg in Germany, and Limoges in France. The ſterility of Holland required all the induſtry of its inhabitants for procuring the neceſſaries of life; and by that means chiefly they become remarkably induſtrious. Cambden aſcribes the ſucceſs of the town of Halifax in the cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manufacture, to its barren ſoil.</note>. The diſadvantages of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſoil, on the contrary, are more than ſufficient to counterbalance its advantages: the inhabitants are rendered indolent, weak, and cowardly. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan may ſeem to be an exception; for though it be extremely fertile, the people however are induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, and export manufactures in great abundance at a very low price. But Hindoſtan properly is not an exception. The Hindows, who are prohibited by their religion to kill any living creature, muſt abandon to animals for food a large proportion of land; which obliges them to cultivate what remains with double induſtry, in order to procure food for themſelves. The populouſneſs of their country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes alſo to make them induſtrious. Arragon was once the moſt limited monarchy in Europe, England not excepted: the barrenneſs of the ſoil was the cauſe, which rendered the people hardy and courageous. In a preamble to one of their laws, the ſtates declare, that were they not more free than other nations, the barrenneſs of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would tempt them to abandon it. Oppoſed to Arragon ſtands Egypt, the fertility of which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the inhabitants ſoft and effeminate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an eaſy prey to every invader<note n="†" place="bottom">Fear, impreſſed by ſtrange and unforeſeen accidents, is the moſt potent cauſe of ſuperſtition. What then made the ancient Egyptians ſo ſuperſtitious? No other country is leſs liable to ſtrange and unforeſeen accidents: no thunder, ſcarce any rain, perfect regularity in the ſeaſons, and in the riſe and fall of the river. So little notion had the Egyptians of variable weather as to be ſurpriſed that the rivers of Greece did not overflow like the Nile. They could not comprehend how their fields were watered: rain, they ſaid, was very irregular; and what if Jupiter ſhould take a conceit to ſend them no rain? The fertility of the ſoil, and the inaction of the inhabitants during the inundation of the river, enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both mind and body, and rendered them timid and puſillanimous. Superſtition was the offspring of this character, as it is of ſtrange and unforeſeen accidents in other countries.</note>. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0032300302:118"/>
fruitfulneſs of the province of Quito in Peru, and the low price of every neceſſary, occaſioned by its diſtance from the ſea, have plunged the inhabitants into ſupine indolence, and exceſſive luxury. The people of the town of Quito in particular have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themſelves to every ſort of debauchery. The time they have to ſpare from wine and women is employed in exceſſive gaming. In other reſpects alſo the manners of a people are influenced by the country they inhabit. A great part of Calabria, formerly populous and fertile, is at preſent covered with trees and ſhrubs, like the wilds of America; and the ferocity of its inhabitants correſpond to the rudeneſs of the fields. The ſame is viſible in the inhabitants of Mount Etna in Sicily: the country and its inhabitants are equally rugged.</p>

               <head>Progreſs and Effects of LUXURY.</head>
               <p>THE wiſdom of Providence is in no inſtance more conſpicuous than in adjuſting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of man to his external circumſtances. Food is extremely precarious in the hunter-ſtate; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuperabounding with little fatigue, ſometimes failing after great fatigue. A ſavage, like other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of prey, has a ſtomach adjuſted to that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he can bear a long faſt; and gorges voraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he has plenty, without being the worſe for it. Whence it is, that barbarians, who have ſcarce any ſenſe of decency, are great and groſs feeders<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Iliad of Homer, book. 9 Agamemnon calls a council at night in his tent. Before entering on buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. they go to ſupper, (line 122.). An embaſſy to Achilles is reſolved on. The ambaſſadors again ſup with Achilles on pork-griſkins, (line 271.) Achilles rejects Agamemnon's offer; and the ſame night Ulyſſes and Diomed ſet out on their expedition to the Trojan camp: returning before day, they had a third ſupper.</note>. They are equally addicted to drunkenneſs; and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly fond of ſpirituous liquors. Drinking was a faſhionable vice in Greece, when Menander, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon, and Diphilus, wrote, if we can rely on the tranſlations or imitations of thoſe writers by Plautus and Terence. Diodorus Siculus reports, that in his time the Gauls, like other barbarians, were much addicted to drinking. The ancient Scandinavians, who, like other ſavages, were intemperate in eating and drinking, ſwallowed large cups to their gods,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0032300302:120"/>
and to ſuch of their countrymen as had fallen brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in battle. We learn from the 25th fable of the Edda, which was their ſacred book, that to hold much liquor was reputed an heroic virtue. Coata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini the Venetian ambaſſador, who wrote ann. 1473, ſays, that the Ruſſians were abandoned to drunkenneſs; and that the whole race would have been extirpated, had not ſtrong liquors been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the ſovereign. The Kamſkatkans love fat; and a man entertains his gueſts by cramming into their mouths fat ſlices of a ſeal, or a whale, cutting off with his knife what hangs out.</p>
               <p>A habit of faſting long, acquired as above in the hunter-ſtate, made meals in the ſhepherd-ſtate leſs frequent than at preſent, though food was at hand. Anciently people fed but once a-day, a faſhion that continued even after luxury was indulged in other reſpects. In the war of Xerxes againſt Greece, it was pleaſantly ſaid of the Abderites, who were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with providing for the King's table, that they ought to thank the gods for not inclining Xerxes to eat twice a-day. Plato held the Sicilians to be glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons for having two meals a-day. Arrian<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 4. cap. 16.</note> obſerves, that the Tyrrhenians had a bad habit of two meals a-day. In the reign of Henry VI. the people of England fed but twice a-day. Hector Boyes, in his hiſtory of Scotland, exclaiming againſt the growing luxury of his cotemporaries, ſays, that ſome perſons were ſo gluttonous as to have three meals a-day.</p>
               <p>Luxury undoubtedly, and love of ſociety, tended to increaſe the number of meals beyond what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires. On the other hand, there is a cauſe that abridged the number for ſome time, which is, the introduction of machines. Bodily ſtrength is eſſential to a ſavage, being his only tool; and with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0032300302:121"/>
it he performs wonders. Machines have rendered bodily ſtrength of little importance; and as men labour leſs than originally, they eat leſs in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">Before fire-arms were known, people gloried in addreſs and bodily ſtrength, and commonly fought hand to hand. But violent exerciſes becoming leſs and leſs neceſſary, went inſenſibly out of faſhion.</note>. Liſten to Hollinſhed the Engliſh hiſtorian upon that article: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Heretofore there hath been much more time ſpent in eating and drinking than commonly is in theſe days; for whereas of old we had breakfaſts in the forenoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verages or nuntions after dinner, and thereto rear ſuppers when it was time to go to reſt; now theſe odd repaſts, thanked be God, are very well left, and each one contenteth himſelf with dinner and ſupper only."</q> Thus, before cookery and luxury crept in, a moderate ſtomach, occaſioned by the abridging bodily labour, made eating leſs frequent than formerly. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not long continue retrograde: good cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and the pleaſure of eating in company, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tide; and people now eat leſs at a time, but more frequently.</p>
               <p>Feaſts in former times were carried beyond all bounds. William of Malmſbury, who wrote in the days of Henry II. ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the Engliſh were univerſally addicted to drunkenneſs, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing over their cups day and night, keeping open houſe, and ſpending the income of their eſtates in riotous feaſts, where eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were carried to exceſs, without any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance."</q> People who live in a corner imagine, that every thing is peculiar to themſelves: what Malmſbury ſays of the Engliſh, is common to all nations, in advancing from the ſelfiſhneſs of ſavages to a reliſh for ſociety, but who have not yet learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0032300302:122"/>
to bridle their appetites. Leland<note n="b" place="bottom">Cellectanea.</note> mentions a feaſt given by the Archbiſhop of York at his inſtallation, in the reign of Edward IV. The following is a ſpecimen: 300 quarters of wheat, 300 tons of ale, 100 tons of wine, 1000 ſheep, 104 oxen, 304 calves, 304 ſwine, 2000 geeſe, 1000 capons, 2000 pigs, 400 ſwans, 104 peacocks, 1500 hot veniſon paſties, 4000 cold, 5000 cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards hot and cold. Such entertainments are a picture of manners. At that early period, there was not diſcovered in ſociety any pleaſure but that of crouding together in hunting and feaſting. The delicate pleaſures of converſation, in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating opinions, ſentiments, and deſires, were to them utterly unknown. There appeared, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, even at that early period, a faint dawn of the fine arts. In ſuch feaſts as are mentioned above, a curious deſert was ſometimes exhibited, termed SUTTEITIE, viz. paſte moulded into the ſhape of animals. On a ſaint's day, angels, prophets, and patriarchs were ſet on the table in plenty. A feaſt given by Trivultius to Lewis XII. of France, in the city of Milan, makes a figure in Italian hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. No fewer than 1200 ladies were invited; and the Cardinals of Narbon and St. Severin, with many other prelates, were among the dancers. After dancing followed the feaſt, to regulate which there were no fewer employed than 160 maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſeholds. Twelve hundred officers, in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of velvet, or ſatin, carried the victuals, and ſerved at the ſide-board. Every table, without diſtinction, was ſerved with ſilver plate, engraved with the arms of the landlord; and, beſide a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of Italian lords, the whole court, and all the houſehold of the King, were feaſted. The bill of-fare of an entertainment given by Sir
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0032300302:123"/>
Watkin Williams Wynn to a company of 1500 perſons, on his coming of age, is a ſample of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Engliſh hoſpitality, which appears to have nothing in view but crouding and cramming merely. The following paſſage is from Hollinſhed: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the length and ſumptuouſneſs of feaſts formerly in uſe, are not totally left off in England, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it proveth very beneficial to the phyſicians, who moſt abound where moſt exceſs and miſgovernment of our bodies do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear."</q> He adds, that claret, and other French wines, were deſpiſed, and ſtrong wines only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The beſt, he ſays, were to be found in monaſteries; for <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that the merchant would have thought his ſoul would go ſtraightway to the devil, if he ſhould ſerve monks with other than the beſt."</q> Our forefathers reliſhed ſtrong wine, for the ſame reaſon that their forefathers reliſhed brandy. In Scotland, ſumptuous entertainments were common at marriages, baptiſms, and burials. In the reign of Charles II. a ſtatute was thought neceſſary to confine them within moderate bounds.</p>
               <p>Of old, there was much eating, with little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety: at preſent, there is great variety, with more moderation. From a houſhold-book of the Earl of Northumberland, in the reign of Henry VIII. it appears, that his family, during winter, fed moſtly on ſalt meat, and ſalt fiſh; and with that view there was an appointment of 160 gallons of muſtard. On fleſh-days through the year, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt for my Lord and Lady was a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, half a chine of mutton, or a chine of beef boiled. On meagre days, a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, a diſh of butter, a piece of ſalt fiſh, or a diſh of buttered eggs. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lent, a loaf of bread, two manchets, a quart of beer, a quart of wine, two pieces of ſalt fiſh, ſix
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0032300302:124"/>
bacon'd herring, four white herring, or a diſh of ſproits. There was as little variety in the other meals, except on feſtival-days. That way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was at the time high luxury: a lady's waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman at preſent w uld never have done with grumbling at ſuch a table. We learn from the ſame book, that the Earl had but two cooks for dreſſing victuals to more than two hundred domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. In thoſe days, hen, chicken, capon, pigeon, plover, partridge, were reckoned ſuch delicacies, as to be prohibited except at my Lord's table<note n="c" place="bottom">Houſehold-book above mentioned.</note>.</p>
               <p>But luxury is always creeping on, and delicacies become more familiar. Hollinſhed obſerves, that white meats, milk, butter, and cheeſe, formerly the chief food of his countrymen, were in his time degraded to be the food of the lower ſort; and that the wealthy fed upon fleſh and fiſh. By a roll of the King of Scotland's houſehold-expence, anno 1378, we find, that the art of gelding cattle was known. The roll is in Latin, and the gelt hogs are termed porcelli eunuchi. Mention is alſo made of chickens, which were not common on Engliſh tables at that time. Olive oil is alſo mentioned.</p>
               <p>In this progreſs, cooks, we may believe, came to make a figure. Hollinſhed obſerves, that the nobility, rejecting their own cookery, employ'd as cooks muſical-headed Frenchmen and ſtrangers, as he terms them. He ſays, that even merchants, when they gave a feaſt, rejected butcher's meat as unworthy of their tables; having jellies of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and in all figures, repreſenting flowers, trees, beaſts, fiſh, fowl, and fruit. Henry Wardlaw Archbiſhop of St. Andrew's, obſerving the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in cookery introduced by James I. of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who had been eighteen years a priſoner in England, exclaimed againſt the abuſe in a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0032300302:125"/>
held at Perth 1433: he obtained a law, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining ſuperfluous diet; and prohibiting the uſe of baked meat to any under the degree of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and permitting it to gentlemen on feſtival-days only; which baked meat, ſays the biſhop, was never before ſeen in Scotland. The peaſants in Sicily regale themſelves with ice during ſummer. They ſay, that a ſcarcity of ſnow would be more grievous to them than a ſcarcity of corn, or of wine. Such progreſs has luxury made, even among the populace. People of faſhion in London and in Paris, who employ their whole thoughts on luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious living, would be ſurpriſed to be told, that they are ſtill deficient in that art. In order to advance luxury of the table to the ACME of perfection, there ought to be a cook for every diſh, as there was in ancient Egypt a phyſician for every diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Barbarous nations, being great eaters, are fond of large joints of meat: and love of ſhow retains great joints in faſhion, even after meals become more moderate: a wild boar was roaſted whole for a ſupper-diſh to Antony and Cleopatra; and when ſtuffed with poultry and wild-fowl, it was a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite diſh at Rome, termed the Trojan boar, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the Trojan horſe. The hoſpitality of the Anglo-Saxons was ſometimes exerted in roaſting an ox whole. Great joints are left off gradually, as people become more and more delicate in eating. In France, great joints are leſs in uſe than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and in England, the voluminous ſurloin of roaſt beef, formerly the pride of the nation, is now in polite families relegated to the ſide-board. In China, where manners are carried to a high degree of refinement, diſhes are compoſed entirely of minc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meat.</p>
               <p>In early times, people were no leſs plain in their houſes than in their food. Toward the end of the ſixteenth century, when Hollinſhed wrote, the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0032300302:126"/>
people of England were beginning to build with brick and ſtone. Formerly houſes were made of poſts wattled together, and plaiſtered with clay to keep out the cold: the roof was ſtraw, ſedge, or reed. It was an obſervation of a Spaniard in Queen Mary's days, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Theſe Engliſh have their houſes of ſticks and dirt, but they fare as well as the King."</q> Hollinſhed mentioning multitudes of chimnies lately erected, obſerves, upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome old men, that in their younger days there were not above two or three, if ſo many, in moſt uplandiſh towns of the realm, religious houſes and manor-places of their lords excepted; but that each made his fire againſt a rere-doſſe in the hall, where he dined, and dreſſed his meat. From Lord Northumberland's houſehold-book, it would ſeem, that grates were unknown at that time, and that they burnt their coal upon the hearth: a certain ſum is allotted for purchaſing wood; becauſe, ſays the book, coals will not burn without it. There is alſo a certain ſum allotted for purchaſing char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, that the ſmoke of the ſea-coal might not hurt the arras. In the fourteenth century, the houſes of private perſons in Paris, as well as in London, were of wood. The ſtreets of Paris, not being paved, were covered with mud; and yet for a woman to travel thoſe ſtreets in a cart, was held an article of luxury, and as ſuch prohibited by Philip the Fair.

               <p>They were equally plain in their houſehold-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. While money was ſcarce, ſervants got land inſtead of wages. An old tenure in England binds the vaſſal to find ſtraw for the King's bed, and hay for his horſe. From Lord Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's houſehold-book, mentioned above, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the linen allowed for a whole year
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0032300302:127"/>
amounted to no more than ſeventy ells; of which there were to be eight table-cloths (no napkins) for his Lordſhip's table, and two towels for waſhing his face and hands. Pewter veſſel was prohibited to be hired, except on Chriſtmas, Eaſter, St. George's day, and Whitſunday. Hollinſhed men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his converſing with old men who remarked many alterations in England within their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; that their fathers, and they themſelves formerly, had nothing to ſleep on but a ſtraw pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, with a log of timber for a pillow; a pillow, ſaid they, being thought meet only for a woman in childbed; and that if a man in ſeven years after marriage could purchaſe a flock-bed, and a ſack of chaff to reſt his head upon, he thought himſelf as well lodged as the lord of the town; who, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, lay ſeldom on a bed entirely of feathers. Another thing they remarked, was change of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-veſſel from timber plates into pewter, and from wooden ſpoons into tin or ſilver.</p>
               <p>Nor were they leſs plain in their dreſs. By an act of parliament in Scotland, anno 1429, none were permitted to wear ſilk or coſtly furs, but knights and lords of 200 merks yearly rent. But luxury in dreſs advanced ſo faſt, that by another act, anno 1457, the ſame dreſs was permitted to aldermen, bailies, and other good worthy men within burgh. And by a third act, anno 1471, it was permitted to gentlemen of L. 100 yearly rent. By a ſumptuary law in Scotland, anno 1621, cloth of gold and ſilver, gold and ſilver lace, velvet, ſatin, and other ſilk ſtuffs, were prohibited, except to noblemen, their wives and children, to lords of parliament, prelates, privy counſellors, lords of manors, judges, magiſtrates of towns, and to thoſe who have 6000 merks of yearly rent. Such diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, with reſpect to landed rent eſpecially, are invidious; nor can they ever be kept up.

The expence of houſehold-furniture is ten times greater than it was ſixty years ago. The taſte for ſuch expence comes to us from France, from Flanders, and from Spain. Eating-tables, formerly but twelve inches long, are now grown to eighteen. They have table-cloths, with cups, ſpoons, and forks, of ſilver, and large knives.

This old man frequently harangued upon the plain fare of former times, finding fault with his neighbours for indulging in bread; and upbraiding them with their toiling like ſlaves for the production of ſuch an unneceſſary article of luxury.</p>
               <p>Thus every one exclaims againſt the luxury of the preſent times, judging more favourably of the paſt; as if what is luxury at preſent, would ceaſe to be luxury when it becomes cuſtomary. What is the foundation of a ſentiment ſo univerſal? In point of dignity, corporeal pleaſures are the loweſt of all that belong to our nature: and for that reaſon, perſons of delicacy diſſemble the pleaſure they take in eating and drinking<note n="f" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, vol. 1. p. 356. edit. 5.</note>. When corporeal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is indulged to exceſs, it is not only low, but mean. But as in judging of things that admit of degrees, compariſon is the ordinary ſtandard, every refinement in corporeal pleaſure beyond what is cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary, is held to be an exceſs, blameable as below the dignity of human nature. Thus every improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in living is pronounced to be luxury while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and drops that character when it comes into common uſe. For the ſame reaſon, what is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the capitol, is eſteemed luxury in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try town. Doth luxury then depend entirely on compariſon? is there no other foundation for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0032300302:133"/>
moderation from exceſs? This will hardly be maintained.</p>
               <p>This ſubject is thrown into obſcurity by giving different meanings to the term luxury. A French writer holds every ſort of food to be luxury, but raw fleſh and acorns, which were the original food of ſavages; and every ſort of covering to be luxury but ſkins, which were their original cloathing. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that definition, the plough, the ſpade, the loom, are all of them inſtruments of luxury; and in that view he juſtly extols luxury to the ſkies. Let every man enjoy the privilege of giving his own meaning to words: at the ſame time, when a man deviates ſo far from their uſual meaning, the neglect to define them is inexcuſable. In common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and in common apprehenſion, luxury al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways implies a faulty exceſs; and upon that account is condemned by all writers, ſuch only excepted as affect to be ſingular.</p>
               <p>This is clearly one branch of the definition of luxury. Another is, that the exceſs muſt be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: a ſingle act of intemperance, however faulty, is not denominated luxury: reiteration muſt be ſo frequent as to become a confirmed habit.</p>
               <p>Nor are theſe particulars all that enter into the definition of luxury. There are many pleaſures, however intemperate or habitual, that are not brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that odious name. Mental pleaſure, ſuch as ariſes from ſentiment or reaſoning, falls not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the verge of luxury, to whatever exceſs indulged. If to relieve merit in diſtreſs be luxury, it is only ſo in a metaphorical ſenſe: nor is it deemed luxury in a damſel of fifteen to peruſe love-novels from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evening. Luxury is confined to the external ſenſes: nor does it belong to every one of theſe; the fine arts have no relation to luxury. A man is not even ſaid to be luxurious, merely for indulging in dreſs, or in fine furniture. Hollinſhed inveighs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0032300302:134"/>
againſt drinking-glaſſes as an article of luxury. At that rate, a houſe adorned with fine pictures or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues would be an imputation on the proprietor. Thus paſſing in review every pleaſure of external ſenſe, we find, that in proper language the term luxury is not applicable to any pleaſure of the eye or ear. That term is confined to the pleaſures of taſte, touch, and ſmell, which appear as exiſting at the organ of ſenſe, and upon that account are held to be merely corporeal<note n="g" place="bottom">See Elements of Criticiſm, Introduction.</note>.</p>
               <p>Having thus circumſcribed our ſubject within its proper bounds, the important point that remains to be aſcertained is, Whether we have any rule for determining what exceſs in corporeal pleaſure may juſtly be denominated faulty. About that point we are at no loſs. Though our preſent life be a ſtate of trial, yet our Maker has kindly indulged us in every pleaſure that is not hurtful to the mind, or to the body; and therefore it can only be hurtful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that falls under the cenſure of being luxurious. It is faulty as a tranſgreſſion of ſelf-duty; and as ſuch it is condemned by the moral ſenſe. The moſt violent declaimer againſt luxury will not affirm, that bread is luxury, or a ſnow-ball uſed for a pillow; for theſe are innocent, becauſe they do no harm. As little will it be affirmed, that dwelling-houſes more capacious than thoſe originally built ought to be condemned as luxury, ſince they contribute to chearfulneſs as well as to health. The plague, ſome centuries ago, made frequent viſits in London, promoted by air ſtagnating in narrow ſtreets, and ſmall houſes. After the great fire anno 1666, the houſes and ſtreets were enlarged, and the plague has not once been known in London.</p>
               <p>Man conſiſts of ſoul and body, ſo intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, that the one cannot be at eaſe while the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0032300302:135"/>
other ſuffers. In order to have <q rend="inline">"mens ſana in corpore ſano,"</q> it is neceſſary to ſtudy the health of both: bodily health ſupports the mind; and nothing tends more than chearfulneſs to ſupport the body, even under a diſeaſe. To preſerve this complicated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine in order, certain exerciſes are proper for the body, and certain for the mind; which ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to encroach the one on the other. Much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bodily exerciſe tend to make us robuſt; but in the mean time the mind is ſtarved: much reading and reflection ſortify the mind, but in the mean time the body is ſtarved. Nor is this all: exceſs in either is deſtructive to both; for exerciſe too violent, whether of mind or body, wears the machine. Indolence, on the other hand, relaxes the machine, and renders it weak or languid. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily indolence breeds the gout, the gravel, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other diſeaſes: nor is mental indolence leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, for it breeds peeviſhneſs and puſillanimity. Thus health both of mind and body is beſt preſerved by moderate exerciſe. And hence a general propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That every indulgence in corporeal pleaſure, which favours either too violent or too languid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, whether of mind or body, is hurtful, and conſequently is luxury in its proper ſenſe. It is ſcarce neceſſary to be added, that every ſuch indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is condemned by the moral ſenſe; for every man can bear teſtimony of this from what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf feels.</p>
               <p>Too great indulgence in corporeal pleaſure ſeldom prompts violent exerciſe; but inſtances are without number of its relaxing even that moderate degree of exerciſe which is healthful both to mind and body. This in particular is the caſe of too great indulgence in eating or drinking: ſuch indulgence creates an habitual appetite, which demanding more than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires, loads the ſtomach, depreſſes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and brings on a habit of liſtleſſneſs and inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0032300302:136"/>
which renders men cowardly and effeminate<note n="*" place="bottom">Luxury and ſelfiſhneſs render men cowards. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are attached to riches, and ſenſual pleaſure, cannot think of abandoning them without horror. A virtuous man conſiders himſelf as placed here in order to obey the will of his Maker: he performs his duty, and is ready to quit his poſt upon the firſt ſummons.</note>. And what does the epicure gain by ſuch exceſs? In the grandeſt palace the maſter occupies not a greater ſpace than his meaneſt domeſtic; and brings to his moſt ſumptuous feaſt perhaps leſs appetite than any of his gueſts. Satiety withal makes him loſe the reliſh even of rarities, which afford to others a poignant pleaſure. What enjoyment then have the opulent above others? Let them beſtow their riches in making others happy: ſuch benevolence will double their own happineſs, firſt, in the direct act of doing good; and next, in reflecting upon the good they have done, the moſt delicate of all feaſts.</p>
               <p>Had the Engliſh continued Pagans, they would have invented a new deity to preſide over cookery. I ſay it with regret, but muſt ſay it, that a luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous table, covered with every dainty, ſeems to be their favourite idol. A miniſter of ſtate never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands a feaſt; and the link that unites thoſe in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is, the cramming one another<note n="†" place="bottom">This was compoſed in the year 1770.</note>.

That ſort of luxury is not unknown in their univerſities; and it is perhaps the only branch of education that ſeldom proves abortive. It has not eſcaped obſervation, that between the years 1740 and 1770 no fewer than ſix mayors of London died in office, a greater number than in the preceding 500 years: ſuch havock doth luxury in eating make

Bonduca their Queen, ready to engage the Romans in a pitched battle, encouraged her army with a pathetic ſpeech, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in particular the following conſideration: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The great advantage we have over them is, that they cannot, like us, bear hunger, thirſt, heat, nor cold.

               </p>
               <p>The indulging in down-beds, ſoft pillows, and eaſy ſeats, is a ſpecies of luxury, becauſe it tends to enervate the body, and to render, it unfit for fatigue. Some London ladies employ an operator for pairing their nails. Two young women of high quality, who were ſiſters, employed a ſervant with ſoft hands to raiſe them gently out of bed in a morning. Nothing leſs than all-powerful vanity can make ſuch perſons ſubmit to the fatigues of a toilet: how can they ever think of ſubmitting to the horrid pangs of child-bearing? In the hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of Aſia, people of rank are rubbed and chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed twice a-day; which, beſide being pleaſant, is neceſſary for health, by moving the blood, in a hot country, where ſloth and indolence prevail. The Greeks and Romans were curried, bathed, and oiled, daily; though they had not the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for that practice: it was luxury in them, though not in the Aſiatics.</p>

With reſpect to exerciſe, the various machines that have been invented for executing every ſort of work, render bodily ſtrength of leſs importance than formerly. This change is favourable to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal operations, without hurting bodily health. The travelling on horſeback, though a leſs vigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of ſtrength than walking, is not luxury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a healthful exerciſe. I dare not ſay ſo much for wheel-carriages: a ſpring-coach, rolling along a ſmooth road, gives no exerciſe; or ſo little, as to be preventive of no diſeaſe: it tends to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the body, and in ſome meaſure alſo the mind. The increaſe of wheel-carriages within a century is a pregnant proof of the growth of luxurious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence. During the reign of James I. the Engliſh judges rode to Weſtminſter on horſeback, and probably did ſo for many years after his death. Charles I. iſſued a proclamation, prohibiting hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-coaches to be uſed in London, except by thoſe who travel at leaſt three miles out of town. At the reſtoration, Charles II. made his public entry into London on horſeback, between his two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Dukes of York and Glouceſter. We have Ruſhworth for our voucher, that in London, not above a hundred years ago, there were but twenty hackney-coaches; which at the ſame time did not ply on the ſtreets, but were kept at home till called for. He adds, that the King and Council publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proclamation againſt them, becauſe they raiſed the price of provender upon the King, nobility, and gentry. At preſent, one thouſand hackney-coaches ply on the ſtreets of London, beſide a great number of ſtage-coaches for travelling from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all parts of the kingdom. The firſt coach with glaſſes in France was brought from Bruſſels to Paris, anno 1650, by the Prince of Condé. Sedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chairs were not known in England before the year 1634. Cookery and coaches have reduced the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary

ſpirit of the Engliſh nobility and gentry to a languid ſtate: the former, by overloading the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, has infected them with diſpiriting ailments; the latter, by foſtering eaſe and indolence, have baniſhed labour, the only antidote to ſuch ailments. Too great indulgence in the fine arts conſumes part of that time which ought to be employed on the important duties of life: but the fine arts, even when too much indulged, produce one good effect, which is, to ſoften and humanize our manners: nor do they harm the body, if they relax not that degree of exerciſe which is neceſſary for ſupporting it in health and vigour.</p>
               <p>The enervating effects of luxury upon the body are, above all, remarkable in war. The officers of Alexander's army were ſoon tainted with Aſiatic manners. Moſt of them, after bathing, had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for rubbing them, and, inſtead of plain oil, uſed precious ointments. Leonatus, in particular, commiſſioned from Egypt the powder he uſed when he wreſtled, which loaded ſeveral camels. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reproved them mildly: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I wonder that men who have undergone ſuch fatigues in war, are not taught by experience, that labour produces ſweeter and ſounder ſleep than indolence. To be voluptuous, is an abject and ſlaviſh ſtate.

every ſympathetic affection brings on a beaſtly ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, which leaves nothing of man but the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal figure. Luxury, beſide, renders the mind ſo effeminate, as to be ſubdued by every diſtreſs: the ſlighteſt pain, whether of mind or body, is a real evil: and any higher degree becomes a ſevere tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The French are far gone in that diſeaſe. Pictures of deep diſtreſs, which attract Engliſh ſpectators, are, to the French, inſupportable: their averſion to pain overcomes the attractive power of ſympathy, and debars from the ſlage every diſtreſs that makes a deep impreſſion on the heart. The Britiſh are gradually ſinking into the ſame weakneſs of mind: Venice Preſerved collects not ſuch numbers as it did originally; and would ſcarce be endured at preſent, were not our ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy blunted by familiarity: a new play upon a ſimilar plan would not take. The gradual decay of manhood in Britain appears from their fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rites. Formerly the deceaſed were attended to the grave by relations and friends of both ſexes, and the day of their death was preſerved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance with ſolemn lamentations, as the day of their birth was, with exhilerating cups. In England a man was firſt relieved from attending his deceaſed wiſe to the grave, and afterward from attending his deceaſed children; and now ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy of mind prevails there, that inſtantly upon the leaſt groan, the deceaſed, abandoned by every relation, is delivered to an undertaker by profeſſion, who is left at leiſure to mimick the funeral rites. In Scotland, ſuch refinement has not yet taken place: a man is indeed excuſed from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wife to the grave; but he performs that duty in perſon to every other relation, his children not excepted. I am told, that people of high faſhion in England begin to leave the care of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0032300302:141"/>
their ſick relations to hired nurſes, and think they do their duty in making ſhort viſits from time to time.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have conſidered Luxury with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe only who are infected with it; and did its poiſonous effects ſpread no wider, the caſe perhaps would be the leſs deplorable. But unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, where luxury prevails, the innocent ſuffer with the guily. A man of oeconomy, whether a merchant or manufacturer, lays up a ſtock for his children, and adds uſeful members to the ſtate. A man, on the contrary, who lives above his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or his profits, accuſtoms his children to luxury, and abandons them to poverty when he dies. Luxury, at the ſame time, is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to population: it enhances the expence of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and confines many to the bachelor-ſtate. Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the table, in particular, is remarkable for that effect: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"L'homme riche met toute ſa gloire à conſommer, toute ſa grandeur à perdre en un jour à ſa table plus de biens qu'il n'en faudroit pour faire ſubſiſter pluſieurs familles. Il abuſe également et des animaux et des hommes; dont le reſte demeure affamé, languit dans la misére, et ne travaille que pour ſatisfaire, à l'appétit immodéré, et à la vanité encore plus inſatiable, de cet homme; qui detruiſant les autres par la diſette, ſe detruit lui-même par les exces<note n="k" place="bottom">Buffon.</note>

To conſider luxury in a political view, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of dreſs, of the table, of equipage, of habitation, is luxury in thoſe who can afford the expence; and the public gains by the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is given to arts, manufactures, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. But a mode of living above a man's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual income, weakens the ſtate, by reducing to poverty, not only the ſquanderers themſelves, but many innocent and induſtrious perſons connected with them. Luxury is above all pernicious in a commercial ſtate. A perſon of moderation is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſmall profits: not ſo the luxurious, who deſpiſe every branch of trade but what returns great profits: other branches are ingroſſed by foreigners, who are more frugal. The merchants of Amſterdam, and even of London, within a century, lived with more oeconomy than their clerks do at preſent. Their country houſes and gardens make not the greateſt articles of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. At firſt, a merchant retires to his country-houſe, on Sundays only and holydays: but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to reliſh indolent retirement, buſineſs grows irkſome, he truſts all to his clerks, loſes the thread of his affairs, ſees no longer with his own eyes, and is now in the high way to perdition. Every croſs accident makes him totter; and in labouring circumſtances he is tempted to venture all, in hopes of re-eſtabliſhment. He falls at laſt to downright gaming; which, ſetting conſcience aſide, is a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent meaſure: he riſks only the money of his creditors, for he himſelf has nothing to loſe: it is now with him, <q rend="inline">"Caeſar aut nihil<note n="†" place="bottom">

The bad effects of luxury, above diſplayed, are not the whole, nor indeed the moſt deſtructive. In all times, luxury has been the ruin of every ſtate where it prevailed. But that more important branch of the ſubject is reſerved to particular ſketches, where it will make a better figure.</p>

But it is ſufficient for me to ſuggeſt facts: the reader will have frequent opportunities to make the obſervation; and he will value his own reflections more than what are inculcated by an author, were he even to aſcend the pulpit, and at every turn to pronounce a ſerious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue.</p>

               <head>Appetite for SOCIETY.—Origin of NATIONAL SOCIETIES.</head>
               <p>THAT there is in man an appetite for ſociety, never was called in queſtion<note n="*" place="bottom">This appetite is not denied by Vitruvius; but it ſeems to have been overlooked in the account he gives (book 2. ch. 1.) of the commencement of ſociety, which is as follows. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In ancient times, men, like wild beaſts, lived in caves and woods, feeding on wild food. In a certain place it happened, that the trees, put in motion by tempeſtuous winds, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their branches one againſt another, took fire. Thoſe in the neighbourhood fled for fear: but as the flames abated, they approached; and finding the heat comfortable, they threw wood into the fire, and preſerved it from being extinguiſhed. They then invited others to take benefit of the fire. Men, thus aſſembled, endeavoured to expreſs their thoughts by articulate ſounds; and by daily practice, certain ſounds, ſignifying things in frequent uſe, came to be eſtabliſhed. From that caſual event, language aroſe. And thus, fire having attracted many to one place, they ſoon diſcovered that they were by nature ſuperior to other animals, differing from them not only in an erect poſture, which gave them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to behold the beauties of the heavens as well as of the earth; but alſo in their hands and fingers, fitted for executing whatever they could invent. They therefore began to cover their habitations with the boughs of trees; ſome dug caves in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and, in imitation of a ſwallow's neſt, ſome ſheltered themſelves with ſprigs and loam. Thus, by obſerving each other's work, and turning their thoughts to invention, they by degrees improved their habitations, and became daily more and more ſkilful."</q> Has not the celebrated Rouſſeau been guilty of the ſame overſight in his Eſſay on the Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Men?

limitted, and how far men are naturally fitted for being uſeful members of civil ſociety, and for being happy in it, are queſtions that open exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive views into human nature, and yet have been little attended to by writers. I grieve at the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, becauſe the preſent enquiry requires an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe queſtions, however abſtruſe.</p>
               <p>As many animals, beſide man, are ſocial, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me probable, that the ſocial laws by which ſuch animals are governed, might open views into the ſocial nature of man. But here I met with a ſecond diſappointment: for after peruſing books without end, I found very little ſatisfaction; though the laws of animal ſociety make the moſt inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and moſt entertaining part of natural hiſtory. A few dry facts, collected occaſionally, enabled me to form the embryo of a plan, which I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the reader: if his curioſity be excited, 'tis well; for I am far from expecting that it will be gratified.</p>
               <p>Animals of prey have no appetite for ſociety, if the momentary act of copulation be not excepted. Wolves make not an exception, even where, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by hunger, they join in attacking a village: as fear prevents them ſingly from an attempt ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous, their caſual union is prompted by appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for food, not by appetite for ſociety. So little of the ſocial is there in wolves, that if one happens to be wounded, he is put to death, and devoured by thoſe of his own kind. Vultures have the ſame diſpoſition. Their ordinary food is a dead carcaſe;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0032300302:147"/>
and they never venture but in a body to attack any living creature that appears formidable. Upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety happineſs ſo much depends, that we do not willingly admit a lion, a tyger, a bear, or a wolf, to have any appetite for ſociety. And in with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from ſuch animals, the goodneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to its favourite man, is conſpicuous: their ſtrength, agility, and voracity, make them ſingly not a little formidable: I ſhould tremble for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, were they diſpoſed to make war in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany<note n="*" place="bottom">The care of Providence in protecting the human race from animals of prey, is equally viſible in other particulars. I can diſcover no facts to make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a lion or a tyger is afraid of a man; but whatever ſecret means are employed by Providence, to keep ſuch fierce and voracious animals at a diſtance, certain it is, that they ſhun the habitations of men. At preſent there is not a wild lion in Europe. Even in Homer's time there were none in Peloponneſus, tho' they were frequent in Thrace, Macedon, and Theſſaly, down to the time of Ariſtotle: whence it is probable, that theſe countries were not at that time well peopled. When men and cattle are together, a lion always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks a beaſt, and never a man. M. Buffon obſerves, that the bear, tho' far from being cowardly, never is at eaſe but in wild and deſert places. The great condor of Peru, a bird of prey of an immenſe ſize, bold, and rapacious, is never ſeen but in deſerts and high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Every river in the coaſt of Guinea abounds with crocodiles, which lie baſking in the ſun during the heat of the day. If they perceive a man approaching, they plunge into the river, though they ſeldom fly from any other animal. A fox, on the contrary, a pole-cat, a kite, though afraid of man, draw near to inhabited places where they find prey in plenty. Such animals do little miſchief; and the little they do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes care and vigilance. But if men, like ſheep, were the natural prey of a lion or a tyger, their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vigour and ſagacity would ſcarce be ſufficient for ſelf-defence. Perpetual war would be their fate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having a ſingle moment for any other occupation; and they could never have emerged out of brutal bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity. It is poſſible that a few cattle might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by armed men, continually on the watch; but to defend flocks and herds covering a hundred hills, would be impracticable. Agriculture could never have exiſted in any ſhape.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0032300302:148"/>
Such harmleſs animals as cannot defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſingly, are provided with an appetite for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that they may defend themſelves in a body. Sheep are remarkable in that reſpect, when left to nature: a ram ſeldom attacks; but the rams of a flock exert great vigour in defending their females and their young<note n="*" place="bottom">M. Buffon has beſtowed leſs pains than becomes an author of his character, upon the nature and inſtincts of animals: he indeed ſcarce once ſtumbles upon truth in his natural hiſtory of the ſheep. He holds it to be ſtupid, and incapable to defend itſelf againſt any beaſt of prey; maintaining, that the race could not have ſubſiſted but under the care and protection of men. Has that author forgot, that ſheep had no enemy more formidable than men, in their original hunter-ſtate? Far from being neglected by nature, there are few ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals better provided for defence. They have a ſort of military inſtinct, forming a line of battle, like ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, when threatened with an attack. The rams, who, in a natural ſtate, make half of the flock, join together; and no lion or tyger is able to reſiſt their united impetuoſity.</note>. The whole ſociety of rooks join in attacking a kite when it hovers about them. A family of wild ſwine never ſeparate till the young be ſufficiently ſtrong to defend themſelves againſt the wolf; and when the wolf threatens, they all join in a body. The pecary is a ſort of wild hog in the iſthmus of Darien: if one of them be attacked, the reſt run to aſſiſt it. There being a natural anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0032300302:149"/>
between that animal and the American tyger, it is not uncommon to find a tyger ſlain with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dead pecaries round him.</p>
               <p>The ſocial appetite is to ſome animals uſeful, not only for deſence, but for procuring the neceſſaries of life. Society among beavers is a notable inſtance of both. As water is the only refuge of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſpecies againſt an enemy, they inſtinctively make their ſettlement on the brink of a lake or of a running ſtream. In the latter caſe, they keep up the water to a proper height by a dam-dike, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with ſo much art as to withſtand the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſloods: in the former, they ſave themſelves the labour of a dam-dike, becauſe a lake generally keeps at the ſame height. Having thus provided for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, their next care is to provide food and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The whole ſociety join in erecting the dam-dike; and they alſo join in erecting houſes. Each houſe has two apartments: in the upper there is ſpace for lodging from ſix to ten beavers: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der holds their proviſions, which are trees cut down by united labour, and divided into ſmall portable parts<note n="a" place="bottom">See the works of the beaver deſcribed moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately by M. Buffon, vol 8.</note>. Bees are a ſimilar inſtance. Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſtory of animals, b. 9. c. 40.</note> ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that bees are the only animals which labour in common, have a houſe in common, eat in common, and have their offspring in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon."</q> A ſingle bee would be ſtill leſs able than a ſingle beaver to build a houſe for itſelf and for its winter-food. The Alpine rat or marmount has no occaſion to ſtore up food for winter, becauſe it lies benumbed without motion all the cold months. But theſe animals live in tribes; and each tribe digs a habitation under ground with great art, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently capacious for lodging the whole tribe; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0032300302:150"/>
the ground with withered graſs, which ſome cut, and others carry. The wild dogs of Congo and Angola hunt in packs, waging perpetual war againſt other wild beaſts. They bring to the place of rendezvous whatever is caught in hunting; and each receives its ſhare<note n="*" place="bottom">However fierce with reſpect to other animals, yet ſo ſubmiſſive are theſe dogs to men, as to ſuffer their prey to be taken from them without reſiſtance. Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans ſalt for their ſlaves what they thus obtain.</note>. The baboons are ſocial animals, and avail themſelves of that quality in procuring food; witneſs their addreſs in robbing an orchard, deſcribed by Kolben in his account of the Cape of Good Hope. Some go into the orchard, ſome place themſelves on the wall, the reſt form a line on the outſide, and the fruit is thrown from hand to hand, till it reach the place of rendezvous. Extending the enquiry to all known animals, we find that the appetite for ſociety is with-held from no ſpecies to which it is neceſſary, whether for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or for food. It appears to be diſtributed by weight and meaſure, in order to accommodate the internal frame of animals to their external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>On ſome animals an appetite for ſociety is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, though in appearance not neceſſary either for defence or for food. With regard to ſuch, the only final cauſe we can diſcover is the pleaſure of living in ſociety. That kind of ſociety is found among horſes. Outhier, one of the French aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicians employed to meaſure a degree of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian toward the north pole, reports, that at Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo all bulky goods are carried in boats during ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but in winter, when the rivers are frozen, and the ground covered with ſnow, that they uſe ſledges drawn by horſes; that when the ſnow melts, and the rivers are open, the horſes, ſet looſe, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0032300302:151"/>
at a certain part of the foreſt, where they ſeparate into troops, and occupy different paſture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields; that when theſe fields become bare, they occupy new ground in the ſame order as at firſt; that they return home in troops when the bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begins; and that every horſe knows its own ſtall. No creature ſtands leſs in need of ſociety than a hare, whether for food or for defence. Of food, it has plenty under its feet; and for defence, it is provided both with cunning and ſwiſtneſs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing however is more common in a moon-light night, than to ſee hares ſporting together in the moſt ſocial manner. But ſociety for pleaſure only, is an imperfect kind of ſociety; and far from being ſo intimate, as where it is provided by nature for defence, or for procuring food<note n="*" place="bottom">Pigeons muſt be excepted, if their ſociety be not neceſſary either for food or habitation, of which I am uncertain. Society among that ſpecies is extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate; and it is obſervable, that the place they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit contributes to the intimacy. A crazy dove-cot moved the proprietor to transfer the inhabitants to a new houſe built for them; and to accuſtom them to it, they were kept a fortnight within doors, with plenty of food. When they obtained liberty, they flew di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to their old houſe; and ſeeing it laid flat, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round and round, lamenting. They then took wing and diſappeared, without once caſting an eye on their new habitation.</note>.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the extent of the appetite, no ſocial animal, as far as can be diſcovered, has an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for aſſociating with the whole ſpecies. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecies is divided into many ſmall tribes; and theſe tribes have no appetite for aſſociating with each other: on the contrary, a ſtray ſheep is thruſt out of the flock, and a ſtray bee muſt inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or be ſtung to death. Every work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence contributes to ſome good end: a ſmall tribe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0032300302:152"/>
is ſufficient for mutual defence; and a very large tribe would find difficulty in procuring ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>How far brute animals are by nature fitted for being uſeful members of civil ſociety, and for being happy in it, is a queſtion that no writer hath ſo much as ſtumbled on. And yet, as that branch of natural hiſtory is alſo neceſſary to my plan, I muſt proceed; tho' I have nothing to lay before the reader but a few ſcattered obſervations, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred when I had no view of turning them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I begin with the inſtinctive conduct of animals, in providing againſt danger. When a flock of ſheep, in the ſtate of nature, goes to reſt, centinels are appointed; who, on appearance of an enemy, ſtamp with the foot, and make a hiſſing ſound; upon which all take the alarm: if no enemy appear, they watch their time, return to the ſlock, and ſend out others in their ſtead. And in flocks that have an extenſive range in hilly countries, the ſame diſcipline obtains, even after domeſtication. Tho' monkies ſleep upon trees, yet a centinel is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appointed, who muſt not ſleep, under pain of being torn to pieces. They preſerve the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline when they rob an orchard: a centinel on a high tree is watchful to announce the very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an enemy. M. Buffon, talking of a ſort of monkey, which he terms Malbrouck, ſays, that they are fond of fruit, and of ſugar-canes; and that while they are loading themſelves, one is placed centinel on a tree, who, upon the approach of a man, cries, Houp! Houp! Houp! loudly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly. That moment they throw away the ſugar-canes that they hold in their left hand, and run off upon three feet. When the marmounts are at work in the field, one is appointed to watch on a high rock; which advertiſes them, by a loud whiſtle, when it ſees a man, an eagle, or a dog. Among beavers, notice is given of the approach of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0032300302:153"/>
by laſhing the water with the tail, which is heard in every habitation. Scale always ſleep on the beach; and to prevent ſurpriſe, centinels are placed round at a conſiderable diſtance from the main body. Wild elephants, which always travel in company, are leſs on their guard in places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented: but when they invade cultivated fields, they march in order, the eldeſt in the front, and the next in age cloſing the rear. The weak are placed in the centre, and the females carry their young on their trunk. They attack in a body; and upon a repulſe, retire in a body. Tame elephants retain ſo much of their original nature, that if one, upon being wounded, turns its back, the reſt inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow. Next in order is the government of a tribe, and the conduct of its members to each other. It is not unlikely, that ſociety among ſome animals, and their mutual affection, may be ſo entire as to prevent all diſcord among them; which indeed ſeems to be the caſe of beavers. Such a ſociety, if there be ſuch, requires no government, nor any laws. A flock of ſheep occupies the ſame ſpot every night, and each hath its own reſting-place. The ſame is obſervable in horned cattle when folded. And as we find not, that any one ever attempts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge another, it is probable that ſuch reſtraint makes a branch of their nature. But ſociety among brute animals is not always ſo perfect. Perverſe inclinations, tending to diſturb ſociety, are viſible among ſome brute animals, as well as among ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men. It is not uncommon for a rook to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſticks from another's neſt; and the pilferer's neſt is demoliſhed by the lex talionis. Perverſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations require government, and government requires laws. As in the caſe now mentioned, the whole ſociety join in inflicting the puniſhment, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among rooks appears to be republican. Apes, on the contrary, are under monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

Apes in Siam go in troops, each under a leader, who preſerves ſtrict diſcipline. A female carnally inclined, retired from the troop, and was followed by a male. The male eſcaped from the leader, who purſued them; but the female was brought back, and in preſence of the whole troop received fifty blows on the cheek, as a chaſtiſement for its incontinence<note n="c" place="bottom">Memoirs of Count Forbin.</note>. But probably there are not many inſtances, among brutes, of government approaching ſo near to that of men. Government among horned cattle appears to have no other end but to preſerve order. Their government is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical; and the election is founded upon perſonal valour, the moſt ſolid of all qualifications in ſuch a ſociety. The bull, who aſpires to be lord of the herd, muſt fight his way to preferment; and after all his rivals are beat off the field, the herd tamely ſubmit. At the ſame time he is not ſecured in the throne for life; but muſt again enter the liſts with any bull that ventures to challenge him. The ſame ſpirit is obſervable among oxen, though in a lower degree. The maſter-ox leads the reſt into the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or into the fold, and becomes unruly if he be not let firſt out: nay, he muſt be firſt yoked in the plough or waggon. Sheep are not employed in work, but in every other reſpect the ſame oeconomy obtains among them. Where the rams happen to be few, in proportion to the other ſheep, they ſometimes divide the flock among them, inſtead of fighting for precedence. Five or ſix ſcore of ſheep were purchaſed a few years ago by the author of this work. The rams, who were only two, divided the flock between them. The two parcels could not avoid paſturing in common, becauſe they were ſhut up in one incloſure: but they had different ſpots for reſt during night; nor was it known, that a ſheep
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0032300302:155"/>
ever deſerted its party, or even changed its reſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. In the two ſpecies laſt mentioned, I find not that there is any notion of puniſhment; nor does it appear to be neceſſary: the leader pretends to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but precedence, which is never diſputed. I bluſh to preſent theſe imperſect hints, the fruit of caſual obſervation, not of intentional enquiry: but I am glad to blow the trumpet, in order to raiſe curioſity in others: if the ſubject be proſecuted by men of taſte and enquiry, many final cauſes, I am perſuaded, will be diſcovered, tending more and more to diſplay the wiſdom and goodneſs of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But what I have chiefly in view at preſent is, to obſerve, that government among brute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, however ſimple, appears to be perfect in its kind; and adapted with great propriety to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Factions in the ſtate are unknown: no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between individuals, no treachery, no deceit, nor any other of thoſe vices that infeſt the human race. In a word, they appear to be perfectly well fitted for that kind of ſociety to which they are prompted by their nature, and for being happy in it.</p>
               <p>Storing up the foregoing obſervations till there be occaſion for them, we proceed to the ſocial nature of man. That men are endued with an appetite for ſociety, will be vouched by the concurring teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all men, each vouching for himſelf. There is accordingly no inſtance of people living in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſtate, where the appetite is not obſtructed by ſome potent obſtacle. The inhabitants of that part of New Holland which Dampier ſaw, live in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though leſs advanced above brutes than any other known ſavages; and ſo intimate is their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that they gather their food, and eat, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The inhabitants of the Canary iſlands lived in the ſame manner, when firſt ſeen by Europeans, which was in the fourteenth century; and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0032300302:156"/>
mentioned by Condamine, drawn by a Jeſuit from the woods to ſettle on the banks of the Oroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noko, muſt originally have been united in ſome kind of ſociety, as they had a common language. In a word, that man hath an appetite for food, is not more certain than that he hath an appetite for ſociety. And here I have occaſion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply one of the obſervations made above. Abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether from the pleaſure we have in ſociety, ſimilar to what we have in eating; evident it is, that to no animal is ſociety more neceſſary than to man, whether for food or for defence. In ſociety, he is chief of the terreſtrial creation; in a ſolitary ſtate, the moſt helpleſs and forlorn. Thus the firſt queſtion ſuggeſted above, viz. To what end was a ſocial appetite beſtowed on man, has received an anſwer, which I flatter myſelf will give ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The next queſtion is, Whether the appetite be limited, as among other animals, to a ſociety of moderate extent; or whether it prompts an aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with the whole ſpecies. That the appetite is limited, will be evident from hiſtory. Men, as far back as they can be traced, have been divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall tribes or ſocieties. Moſt of theſe, it is true, have, in latter times, been united into large ſtates: ſuch revolutions however have been brought about, not by an appetite for a more extenſive ſociety, but by conqueſt, or by the junction of ſmall tribes for defence againſt the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. A ſociety may indeed be too ſmall for complete gratification of the appetite; and the appetite thus cramped welcomes every perſon into the ſociety till it have ſufficient ſcope: the Romans, a diminutive tribe originally, were fond to aſſociate even with their enemies after a victory. But, on the other hand, a ſociety may be too large for complete gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. An extenſive empire is an object too bulky: national affection is too much diffuſed; and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0032300302:157"/>
the mind is not at eaſe till it finds a more contracted ſociety, correſponding to the moderation of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Hence the numerous orders, aſſociations, fraternities, and diviſions, that ſpring up in every great ſtate. The ever-during Blues and Greens in the Roman empire, and Guelphs and Gibelines in Italy, could not have long ſubſiſted after the cauſe of their enmity was at an end, but for a tendency in the members of a great ſtate to contract their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial connections<note n="*" place="bottom">The never-ceaſing factions in Britain proceed, not from a ſociety too much extended, but from love of power and of wealth, to reſtrain which there is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authority in a free government.</note>. Initiations among the ancients were probably owing to the ſame cauſe; as alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations of artiſans among the moderns, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſtery and ſecrecy, and excluding all ſtrangers. Of ſuch aſſociations or brotherhoods, the free ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons excepted, there is ſcarce now a veſtige remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>We find now, after an accurate ſcrutiny, that the ſocial appetite in man comprehends not the whole ſpecies, but a part only; and commonly a ſmall part, preciſely as in other animals. Here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other final cauſe ſtarts up, no leſs remarkable than that explained above. An appetite to aſſociate with the whole ſpecies would form ſtates ſo unwieldy by numbers, as to be incapable of any government. Our appetite is wiſely confined within ſuch limits as to form ſtates of moderate extent, which of all are the beſt fitted for good government; and we ſhall ſee afterward that they are alſo the beſt fitted for improving the human powers, and for envigorating every manly virtue. Hence an inſtructive leſſon, That a great empire is ill ſuited to human nature, and that a great conqueror is in more reſpects than one an enemy to mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0032300302:158"/>
The limiting our ſocial appetite within moderate bounds ſuggeſts another final cauſe. An appetite to aſſociate with the whole ſpecies would collect into one ſociety all who are not ſeparated from each other by wide ſeas and inacceſſible mountains; and conſequently would diſtribute mankind into a very few ſocieties, conſiſting of ſuch multitudes as to reduce national affection to a mere ſhadow. Nature hath wiſely limited the appetite in proportion to our mental capacity. Our relations, our friends, and our other connections, open an extenſive field for the exerciſe of affection: nay, our country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, if not too extenſive, would alone be ſufficient to engroſs our whole affection. But that beautiful ſpeculation falls more properly under the principles of morality; and there it ſhall not be overlooked.</p>
               <p>What comes next in order, is to examine how we ſtand affected to thoſe who are not of our tribe or ſociety. I pave the way to this examination, by taking up man naked at his entrance into life. An infant at firſt has no feeling but bodily pain; and it is familiarized with its nurſe, its parents, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with others, before it is ſuſceptible of any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. All weak animals are endowed with a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of fear, which prompts them to ſhun danger; and fear, the firſt paſſion diſcovered in an infant, is raiſed by every new face: the infant ſhrinks and hides itſelf in the boſom of its nurſe<note n="*" place="bottom">In this reſpect the human race differs widely from that of dogs: a puppy, the firſt time it ſees a man, runs to him, licks his hand, and plays about his feet.</note>
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, vol. 1. p. 441. edit. 5.</note>. Thus every ſtranger is an object of fear to an infant; and conſequently of averſion, which is generated by fear. Fear leſſens gradually as our circle of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance enlarges, eſpecially in thoſe who rely on bodily ſtrength. Nothing tends more effectually to diſſipate fear, than conſciouſneſs of ſecurity in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0032300302:159"/>
ſocial ſtate: in ſolitude, no animal is more timid than man; in ſociety, none more bold. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that averſion may ſubſiſt after fear is gone: it is propagated from parents to their children through an endleſs ſucceſſion; and is infectious like a diſeaſe. Thus enmity is kept up between tribes, without any particular cauſe. A neighbouring tribe, conſtantly in our ſight, and capable to hurt us, is the object of our ſtrongeſt averſion: it leſſens in proportion to diſtance; and terminates in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute indifference with reſpect to very diſtant tribes. Upon the whole, it appears, that the nature of man with reſpect to thoſe of his own kind is reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able into the following particulars. Firſt, Affection for our private connections, and for our country in general. Second, Averſion to neighbours who are ſtrangers to us, and to neighbouring tribes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Third, Indifference with reſpect to all others.</p>
               <p>As I neither hope nor wiſh, that the nature of man, as above delineated, be taken upon my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I propoſe to verify it by clear and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial facts. But to avoid the multiplying inſtances unneceſſarily, I ſhall confine myſelf to ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the averſion that neighbouring tribes have to each other; taking it for granted, that private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and love to our country, are what no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doubts of. I begin with examples of rude na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where nature is left to itſelf, without culture. The inhabitants of Greenland, good-natured and inoffenſive, have not even words for expreſſing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or envy: ſtealing among themſelves is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and a young woman guilty of that crime, has no chance for a huſband. At the ſame time, they are faithleſs and cruel to thoſe who come among them: they conſider the reſt of mankind as a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent race, with whom they reject all ſociety. The morality of the inhabitants of New Zealand is not more refined. Writers differ about the inhabitants of the Marian or Ladrone iſlands: Magellan, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0032300302:160"/>
other voyagers, ſay, that they are addicted to thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and their teſtimony occaſioned theſe iſlands to be called Ladrones. Pere le Gobien, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſays, that, far from being addicted to thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they leave every thing open, having no diſtruſt one of another. Theſe accounts differ in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, not in reality. Magellan was a ſtranger; and he talks of ſtealing from him and from his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Father Gobien lived long among them, and talks of their fidelity to each other. Plan Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, who viſited Tartary in the year 1246, obſerves of the Tartars, that, though full of veracity to their neighbours, they thought themſelves not bound to ſpeak truth to ſtrangers. The Greeks an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently were held to be pirates: but not properly; for they committed depredations upon ſtrangers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Caeſar, ſpeaking of the Germans<note n="e" place="bottom">Lib. 6. c. 23. de Bello Gallico.</note>, ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam quae extra fines cujuſque civitatis fiunt<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">"They hold it not infamous to rob without the bounds of their canton."</q>
                     </note>."</q> This was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the caſe of our highlanders, till they were brought under due ſubjection after the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion 1745. Bougainville obſerves, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Otaheite, named by the Engliſh, King-George's iſland, made no difficulty of ſtealing from his people; and yet never ſteal among themſelves, having neither locks nor bars in their houſes. The people of Benin in Negroland are good-natured, gentle, and civilized; and ſo generous, that if they receive a preſent, they are not at eaſe till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it double. They have unbounded confidence in their own people; but are jealous of ſtrangers, though they politely hide their jealouſy. Ruſſian peaſants think it a greater ſin to eat meat in Lent, than to murder one of another country. Among
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0032300302:161"/>
the Koriacs, bordering on Kamſkatka, murder within the tribe is ſeverely puniſhed; but to murder a ſtranger is not minded. While Rome continued a ſmall ſtate, neighbour and enemy were expreſſed by the ſame word<note n="f" place="bottom">Hoſtis.</note>. In England of old, a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner was not admitted to be a witneſs. Hence it is that, in ancient hiſtory, we read of wars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion among ſmall ſtates in cloſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. It was ſo in Greece; it was ſo in Italy during the infancy of the Roman republic; it was ſo in Gaul, when Caeſar commenced hoſtilities againſt that country<note n="g" place="bottom">Lib. 6. c. 15. de Bello Gallico.</note>; and it was ſo all the world over. Many iſlands in the South ſea, and in other remote parts, have been diſcovered by Europeans; who commonly found the natives with arms in their hands, reſolute to prevent the ſtrangers from land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Orellana, lieutenant to Gonzales Piſarro, was the firſt European who ſailed down the river Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon to the ſea. In his paſſage, he was continually aſſaulted with arrows from the banks of the river; and ſome even ventured to attack him in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes.</p>
               <p>Nor does ſuch averſion wear away even among poliſhed people. An ingenious writer<note n="h" place="bottom">Baretti.</note> remarks, that almoſt every nation hate their neighbours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing why. I once heard a Frenchman ſwear, ſays that writer, that he hated the Engliſh, parce qu'ils verſent du beurre fondu ſur leur veau roti<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. The populace of Portugal have to this day an uncommon averſion to ſtrangers: even thoſe of Liſbon, though a trading town frequented by many different nations, muſt not be excepted. Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers report, that the people of the duchy of Milan,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0032300302:162"/>
remarkable for good-nature, are the only Italians who are not hated by their neighbours. The Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monteſe and Genoeſe have an averſion to each other, and agree only in their antipathy to the Tuſcans. The Tuſcans diſlike the Venetians; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans abound not with good-will to the Tuſcans, Venetians, or Neapolitans. Very different is the caſe with reſpect to diſtant nations: inſtead of being objects of averſion, their manners, cuſtoms, and ſingularities, amuſe us greatly<note n="*" place="bottom">Voltaire, (Univerſal Hiſtory, ch. 40.) obſerving, rightly, that jealouſy among petty princes is productive of more crimes than among great monarchs, gives a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unſatisfactory reaſon, viz. That having little force, they muſt employ fraud, poiſon, and other ſecret crimes; not adverting, that power may be equally diſtributed among ſmall princes as well as among great men. It is antipathy that inſtigates ſuch crimes, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt violent among the neareſt neighbours.</note>.</p>
               <p>Infants differ from each other in averſion to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; ſome being extremely ſhy, others leſs ſo; and the like difference is obſervable in whole tribes. The people of Milan cannot have any averſion to their neighbours, when they are ſuch favourites of all around them. The inhabitants of ſome South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea iſlands, mentioned above<note n="i" place="bottom">Book 1. Sketch 1.</note>, appear to have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no averſion to ſtrangers. But that is a rare inſtance, and has ſcarce a parallel in any other part of the globe. It holds alſo true, that nations the moſt remarkable for patriotiſm, are equally remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for averſion to ſtrangers. The Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, were equally remarkable for both. Patriotiſm, a vigorous principle among the Engliſh, makes them extremely averſe to naturalize foreigners. The inhabitants of New Zealand, both men and women, appear to be of a mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpoſition; they treat one another with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0032300302:163"/>
but are implacable to their enemies, and never give quarter. It is even cuſtomary among them to eat the fleſh of their enemies.</p>
               <p>To a perſon of humanity, the ſcene here exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited is far from being agreeable. Man, it may be thought, is of all animals the moſt barbarous; for even animals of prey are innoxious with reſpect to their own kind<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. Averſion to ſtrangers makes a branch of our nature: it exiſts among individuals in private life; it flames high between neighbouring tribes; and is viſible even in infancy. Can ſuch perverſity of diſpoſition promote any good end? This queſtion, which pierces deep into human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is reſerved to cloſe the preſent ſketch.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing deduction, univerſal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, inculcated by ſeveral writers as a moral duty, is diſcovered to be erroneous. Our appetite for ſociety is limitted, and our duty muſt be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in proportion. But of this more directly when the principles of morality are taken under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>We are taught by the great Newton, that attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repulſion in matter are, by alteration of circumſtances, converted one into the other. This holds alſo in affection and averſion, which may be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0032300302:164"/>
termed, not improperly, mental attraction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. Two nations, originally ſtrangers to each other, may, by commerce, or other favourable circumſtance, become ſo well acquainted, as to change from averſion to affection. The oppoſite manners of a capital and of a country-town afford a good illuſtration. In the latter, people, occupied with their domeſtic concerns, are in a manner ſtrangers to each other: a degree of averſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, which gives birth to envy and detraction. In the former, a court, with public amuſements, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote general acquaintance: repulſion yields to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and people become fond to aſſociate with their equals. The union of two tribes into one, is another circumſtance that converts repulſion into at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. Such converſion, however, is far from being inſtantaneous; witneſs the different ſmall ſtates of Spain, which were not united in affection for many years after they were united under one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; and this was alſo the caſe of the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of England and Scotland. In ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the converſion is inſtantaneous; as where a ſtranger becomes an object of pity or of gratitude. Many low perſons in Britain contributed chearfully for maintaining ſome French ſeamen, made priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the commencement of the late war. It is no leſs inſtantaneous, when ſtrangers, relying on our humanity, truſt themſelves in our hands. Among the ancients, it was hoſpitality to ſtrangers only that produced mutual affection and gratitude: Glaucus and Diomede were of different countries. Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſtrangers is a pregnant ſymptom of improving manners. Caeſar, ſpeaking of the Germans<note n="k" place="bottom">Lib. 6. c. 23. de Bello Gallico.</note>, ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Hoſpites violare, fas non putant: qui, qua-qua de cauſa, ad eos venerunt, ab injuria prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, ſanctoſque habent; iis omnium domus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

It ſhews great refinement in the Celtae, that the killing a ſtranger was capital, when the killing a citizen was baniſhment only<note n="l" place="bottom">Nicholaus Damaſcenus.</note>. The Swedes and Goths were eminently hoſpitable to ſtrangers; as indeed were all the northern nations of Europe<note n="m" place="bottom">Saxo Grammaticus. Crantz.</note>. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes of Fouli are celebrated by travellers as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely kind to ſtrangers. The native Brazilians are ſingularly hoſpitable. A ſtranger no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives among them than he is ſurrounded with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who waſh his feet, and ſet before him to eat the beſt things they have. If a ſtranger have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to go more than once to the ſame village, the perſon whoſe gueſt he was takes it much amiſs if he thinks of changing his lodging.</p>
               <p>There are cauſes that for a time ſuſpend enmity between neighbouring ſtates. The ſmall ſtates of Greece, among whom war had no end, frequently ſmothered their enmity to join againſt the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble monarch of Perſia. There are alſo cauſes that ſuſpend for a time all animoſity between factions in the ſame ſtate. The endleſs factions in Britain about power and pre-eminence, not a little diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable during peace, are laid aſleep during a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign war.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, attraction is converted into repulſion by various cauſes. One is, the ſplitting a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0032300302:166"/>
great monarchy into many ſmall ſtates; of which the Aſſyrian, the Perſian, the Roman, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen empires, are inſtances. The amor patriae, faint in an extenſive monarchy, readily yields to averſion, operating between two neighbouring ſtates, leſs extenſive. This is obſervable between neighbouring colonies even of the ſame nation: the Engliſh colonies in North America, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome affection for their mother-country, have contracted an averſion to each other. And happy for them is ſuch averſion, if it prevent their uniting in order to acquire independency: wars without end would be the inevitable conſequence, as among ſmall ſtates in cloſe neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the road has been ſmooth, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But we have not yet finiſhed our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and the remaining queſtion, viz. How far are men fitted by their nature for being uſeful members of civil ſociety, and for being happy in it, will, I ſuſpect, lead into a road neither ſmooth nor free from obſtruction. The ſocial branch of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be wofully imperfect, if man had an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for ſociety without being fitted for that ſtate; the appetite, inſtead of tending to a good end, would be his bane. And yet, whether he be or be not fitted for ſociety, ſeems doubtful. In examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conduct of man, he is to us a diſguſtful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his averſion to thoſe of a different tribe; and I violently ſuſpect, that in his behaviour even to thoſe of his own tribe, he will ſcarce be found an agreeable object. That he is fitted by nature for being an uſeful member of a ſocial ſtate, and for being happy in it, appears from facts many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. I inſtance firſt, ſeveral correſponding prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or propenſities, that cannot be exerted nor gratified but in ſociety, viz. the propenſities of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, and of relying on human teſtimony; appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for knowledge, and deſire to communicate
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0032300302:167"/>
knowledge; anxiety in diſtreſs to be pitied, and ſympathy with the diſtreſſed; appetite for praiſe, and inclination to praiſe the deſerving<note n="†" place="bottom">Appetite for praiſe is inherent even in ſavages: witneſs thoſe of North America, who, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, are fond of dreſs. I mean the men; for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſuch miſerable ſlaves as to have no ſpirit for ornament.</note>. Such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding propenſities not only qualify men for the ſocial ſtate as far as their influence reaches, but attract them ſweetly into ſociety for the ſake of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and make them happy in it. But this is not all, nor indeed the greater part. Do not bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, compaſſion, magnanimity, heroiſm, and the whole train of ſocial affections, demonſtrate our fitneſs for ſociety, and our happineſs in it? And juſtice, above all other virtues, promotes peace and concord in that ſtate. Nor ought the faculty of ſpeech to be overlooked, which in an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree qualifies man for ſociety, and is a plentiful ſource of enjoyment in it.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, there are facts, not fewer in number, nor leſs various, tending to evince, that man is ill fitted for ſociety, and that there is little happineſs for him in it. What can be more averſe to concord in ſociety than diſſocial paſſions? and yet theſe prevail among men. Are not envy, malice, revenge, treachery, deceit, avarice, ambition, &amp;c. &amp;c. noxious weeds that poiſon ſociety? We meet every where perſons bent on the deſtruction of others, evincing that man has no enemies more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable than of his own kind, and of his own tribe. Are not diſcord and feuds the chief articles in the hiſtory of every ſtate, factions violently bent againſt each other, and frequently breaking out into civil wars? Appian's hiſtory of the civil wars of Rome exhibits a horrid ſcene of maſſacres, proſcriptions, and forfeitures; the leaders ſacrificing their firmeſt

friends, for liberty to ſuck the blood of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; as if to ſhed human blood was the ruling paſſion of man. But the Romans were far from being ſingular: the polite Greeks, commonly ſo characterized, were ſtill more brutal and bloody. The following paſſage is copied from a celebrated author<note n="n" place="bottom">Eſſay of the Populouſneſs of Ancient Nations, by David Hume, Eſq:</note>. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Not to mention Dionyſius the elder, who is computed to have butchered in cold blood above 10,000 of his fellow-citizens; nor Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles, Nabis, and others, ſtill more bloody than he; the tranſactions even in free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were extremely violent and deſtructive.

Stormy paſſions raged every where with unrelenting fury; every place a chaos of confuſion and diſtreſs. No man was ſecure but in his caſtle; and to venture abroad unleſs well armed, and well attended, would have been an act of high temerity. So little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was there among the French in the tenth century, that an abbot of Clugni, invited by the Count of Paris to bring ſome monks to the abbey of St. Maur, near that city, excuſed himſelf for declining a journey through a ſtrange and unknown country. In the hiſtory of Scotland, during the minority of James II. we find nothing but barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cruel manners, depredations, burning of houſes, bloodſhed and maſſacre without end. Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcottie ſays, that oppreſſion, theft, ſacrilege, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing of women, were but a dalliance. How ſimilar to beaſts of prey ſet looſe againſt each other in the Roman Circus!</p>
               <p>Men are prone to ſplit into parties for the very ſlighteſt cauſes; and when a cauſe is wanting, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are often formed upon words merely. Whig and Tory ſubſiſted long in England, upon no better foundation. The Tories profeſſed paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but declared, that they would not be ſlaves. The Whigs profeſſed reſiſtance; but declared it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to reſiſt unleſs to prevent the being madeſlaves. Had theſe parties been diſpoſed to unite, they ſoon would have diſcovered, that they differed in words only. The ſame obſervation is applicable to many religious diſputes. One ſect maintains, that we are ſaved by faith alone; another, that good works are neceſſary. The difference lies merely in words. The firſt acknowledges, that if a man commit ſin,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0032300302:170"/>
he cannot have faith; and conſequently under faith are comprehended good works. The other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that good works imply good intention, or, in other words, faith; and conſequently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good works faith is comprehended<note n="o" place="bottom">See Knox's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Scotland, p. 13.</note>. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtance, ſolemnly ludicrous, is of parties formed merely from an inclination to differ, without any cauſe real or verbal. No people were leſs inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the late war between the Queen of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary and the King of Pruſſia, than the citizens of Ravenna. They however ſplit into two parties, which renounced all ſociety with each other. After the battle of Roſbach, a leading partyman withdrew for a month, without once ſhowing his face in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. But our catalogue is not yet complete. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences concerning civil matters make no figure compared with what concerns religion. It is lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to obſerve, that religious ſects reſemble neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtates; the nearer they are to one another, the greater is their rancour and animoſity. But as all hiſtories are full of the cruelty and deſolation oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by differences in religious tenets, I cannot bear to dwell longer upon ſuch horrid ſcenes.</p>
               <p>What concluſion are we to draw from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going facts, ſo inconſiſtent in appearance with each other? I am utterly at a loſs to reconcile them, otherwiſe than by holding man to be a compound of principles and paſſions, ſome ſocial, ſome diſſocial. Oppoſite principles or paſſions cannot at the ſame inſtant be exerted upon the ſame object<note n="p" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, vol. 1. p. 143. edit. 5.</note>; but they may be exerted at the ſame inſtant upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent objects, and at different times upon the ſame object. This obſervation ſerves indeed to explain a ſeeming inconſiſtency in our nature, as being at
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0032300302:171"/>
one time highly ſocial, and at another time no leſs diſſocial: but it affords not a ſolution to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Whether, upon the whole, men be fitted for ſociety, and for being happy in it. In order to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, we find it neceſſary to take a ſecond view of the natural hiſtory of man.</p>
               <p>In a naſcent ſociety, where men hunt and fiſh in common, where there is plenty of game, and where the ſenſe of property is faint, mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevails, becauſe there is no cauſe of diſcord; and diſſocial paſſions find ſufficient vent againſt neighbouring tribes. Such is the condition of the North-American ſavages, who continue hunters and fiſhers to this day; and ſuch is the condition of all brute animals that live in ſociety, as mentioned above. The iſland Otaheite is divided into many ſmall cantons, having each a chief of its own. Theſe cantons never make war on each other, tho' they are frequently at war with the inhabitants of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring iſlands. The inhabitants of the new Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine iſlands, if Father Gobien be credited, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted for ſociety than any other known nation. Sweetneſs of temper, and love to do good, form their character. They never commit acts of violence: war they have no notion of; and it is a proverb among them, That a man never puts a man to death. Plato places the ſeat of juſtice and of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among the firſt men; and among them exiſted the golden age, if it ever did exiſt. But when a nation, becoming populous, begins with rearing flocks and herds, proceeds to appropriate land, and is not ſatisfied without matters of luxury over and above; ſelfiſhneſs and pride gain ground, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ruling and unruly paſſions. Cauſes of diſcord multiply, vent is given to avarice and reſentment; and among a people not yet perfectly ſubmiſſive to government, diſſocial paſſions rage, and threaten a total diſſolution of ſociety: nothing indeed ſuſpends the impending blow, but the unwearied, though ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0032300302:172"/>
operation of the ſocial appetite. Such was the condition of the Greeks at a certain period of their progreſs, as mentioned above; and ſuch was the condition of Europe, and of France in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, during the anarchy of the feudal ſyſtem, when all was diſcord, blood, and rapine. In general, wherever avarice and diſorderly paſſions bear rule, I boldly pronounce, that men are ill qualified for ſociety.</p>
               <p>Providence extracts order out of confuſion. Men, in a ſociety ſo uncomfortable, are taught by dire experience, that they muſt either renounce ſociety, or qualify themſelves for it—the choice is eaſy, but how difficult the practice! After infinite ſtruggles, appetite for ſociety prevailed; and time, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conqueror, perfected men in the art of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing their paſſions, or of diſſembling them. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now no enjoyment but in ſociety, we are ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about the good-will of others; and we adhere to juſtice and good manners: diſorderly paſſions are ſuppreſſed, kindly affections encouraged, and men become leſs unfit for ſociety than formerly.</p>
               <p>But is the progreſs of men toward the perfection of ſociety to ſtop here? are luſt of power and of property to continue for ever leading principles? are envy, revenge, treachery, deceit, never to have an end? <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How devoutly to be wiſhed, (it will be ſaid), that all men were upright and honeſt; and that all of the ſame nation were united like a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle family in concord and mutual affection! Here indeed would be perpetual ſunſhine, a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en age, a ſtate approaching to that of good men made perfect in heavenly manſions."</q> Beware of indulging ſuch pleaſing dreams. The ſyſtem of Providence differs widely from our wiſhes; and ſhall ignorant man venture to arraign Providence? Are we qualified to judge of the whole, when but ſo ſmall a part is viſible? It is our duty to believe,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0032300302:173"/>
that were the whole viſible, it would appear beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. We are not however reduced to an act of pure faith: a glimmering light, breaking in, makes it at leaſt doubtful, whether upon the whole it be not really better for us to be as we are. Let us follow that glimmering light to ſee where it will lead us.</p>
               <p>I begin with obſerving, that tho' in our preſent condition we ſuffer much diſtreſs from ſelfiſh and diſſocial paſſions, yet cuſtom renders our diſtreſſes familiar, and hardens us not only to bear but to brave them. Strict adherence to the rules of juſtice would indeed ſecure our perſons and our property: robbery and murder would vaniſh, and locks and guns be heard of no more. So far excellent, were no new evils to come in their place: but the void muſt be filled, and mental diſtreſſes would break in of various kinds, ſuch particularly as proceed from refined delicacy and nice ſenſibility of honour, little regarded while we are expoſed to dangers more alarming. And whether the change would be much to our advantage, appears doubtful: pain as well as pleaſure is meaſured by compariſon; and the ſlighteſt pain, ſuch for example, as ariſes from a tranſgreſſion of civility or good-breeding, will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm a perſon who has never ſelt any more ſevere. At any rate, natural evils will remain; and that extreme delicacy and ſoftneſs of temper which are produced by eternal peace and concord, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch evils inſupportable: the ſlight inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of a rough road, bad weather, or homely fare, would become ſerious evils, and afflict the traveller paſt enduring. The French, among whom ſociety has obtained a more refined poliſh than in any other nation, have become ſo ſoft and delicate as to loſe all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ortitude in diſtreſs. They cannot bear even a repreſentation of ſevere affliction in a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dy: an Engliſh audience would fall aſleep at the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0032300302:174"/>
ſlight diſtreſſes that make a deep impreſſion in the French theatre.</p>
               <p>But now ſuppoſing, that a ſcrupulous adherence to the rules of morality would be a real improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſociety; yet to me it appears evident, that men as individuals would ſuffer more by that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, than they would gain as members of ſociety. In order to preſerve the rules of juſtice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, and to maintain perfect concord and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among men, all diſſocial and ſelfiſh paſſions muſt neceſſarily be extirpated, or brought under abſolute ſubjection. Attend to the conſequences: they deſerve our moſt ſober attention. Agitation is requiſite to the mind as well as to the body: a man engaged in a briſk purſuit, whether of buſineſs or of pleaſure, is in his element, and in high ſpirits; but when no object is in view to be attained or to be avoided, his ſpirits flag, and he ſinks into languor and deſpondence. To prevent a condition ſo bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to man, he is provided with many paſſions, which impel him to action without intermiſſion, and envigorate both mind and body. But, upon the preſent ſuppoſition, ſcarce any motive to action would remain; and man, reduced to a lethargic ſtate, would rival no being above an oyſter or a ſenſitive plant.</p>
               <p>Nor ought it to be overlooked, that an uniform life of peace, tranquillity, and ſecurity, would not be long reliſhed. Conſtant repetition of the ſame pleaſures would render even a golden age taſteleſs, like an Italian ſky during a long ſummer. Nature has for wiſe purpoſes impreſſed upon us a taſte for variety<note n="q" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, vol. 1. p. 320. edit. 5.</note>; and without it, life would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſipid. Paragua, when governed by the Jeſuits, affords a fine illuſtration. It was divided into pariſhes, in each of which a Jeſuit preſided as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0032300302:175"/>
king, prieſt, and prophet. The natives were not ſuffered to have any property, but laboured inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly for their daily bread, which was delivered to them out of a public magazine. The men were employed in agriculture, the women in ſpinning; and certain preciſe hours were allotted for labour, for food, for prayer, and for ſleep<note n="*" place="bottom">Beſide Paragua tea, for which there is great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Peru, cotton, tobacco, and ſugar-canes, were cultivated in Paragua, and the product was ſtored up in magazines. No Indian durſt keep in his houſe ſo much as an ounce of any of theſe commodities, under pain of receiving twelve laſhes in honour of the twelve apoſtles, beſide faſting three days in the houſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The fathers ſeldom inflicted a capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it deprived them of a profitable ſlave.</note>. They ſunk into ſuch a liſtleſs ſtate of mind, as to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret at dying when attacked by diſeaſe or by old age. Such was their indifference about what might befall them, that tho' they adored the Jeſuits, yet they made no oppoſition, when the fathers were, ann. 1767, attacked by the Spaniards, and their famous republic demoliſhed. The monkiſh life is contradictory to the nature of man: the languor of that ſtate is what, in all probability, tempts many a monk and nun, to find occupation even at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of virtue. The lives of the Malteſe knights is far from being agreeable, now that their knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errantry againſt the Turks has ſubſided. While they reſide in the iſland, a ſtrict uniformity in their manner of living is horridly irkſome. Abſence is their only relief, when they can obtain permiſſion. There will not at laſt remain a knight in the iſland, except ſuch as by office are tied to attendance.</p>
               <p>I proceed to another conſideration. Familiarity with danger is neceſſary to eradicate our natural timidity; and ſo deeply rooted is that principle, that familiarity with danger of one ſort does not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0032300302:176"/>
harden us with reſpect to any other ſort. A ſoldier, bold as a lion in the field, is faint-hearted at ſea, like a child; and a ſeaman, who braves the winds and waves, trembles when mounted on a horſe of ſpirit. Courage does not ſuperabound at preſent, even in the midſt of dangers and unforeſeen acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: ſedentary manufacturers, who ſeldom are in the way of harm, are remarkably puſillanimous. What would men be in the ſuppoſed condition of univerſal peace, concord, and ſecurity? they would rival a hare or a mouſe in timidity. Farewell, upon that ſuppoſition, to courage, magnanimity, heroiſm, and to every paſſion that ennobles human nature! There may perhaps be men, who, hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves in being ſecure againſt harm, would not be altogether averſe to ſuch degeneracy. But if ſuch men there be, I pray them only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that in the progreſs from infancy to maturity, all nations do not ripen equally. One nation may have arrived at the ſuppoſed perfection of ſociety, before another has advanced much beyond the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ſtate. What ſecurity hath the former againſt the latter? Preciſely the ſame that timid ſheep have againſt hungry wolves.</p>
               <p>I ſhall finiſh with one other effect of the ſuppoſed perfection of ſociety, more degrading, if poſſible, than any mentioned. Exerciſe, as obſerved above, is not leſs eſſential to the mind than to the body. The reaſoning faculty, for example, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and varied exerciſe, will remain weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhing to the end of life. By what means doth a man acquire prudence and foreſight, but by practice? It is preciſely here as in the body: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a child of motion, and it will never acquire any ſtrength of limbs. The many difficulties that men encounter, and their various objects of purſuit, rouſe the underſtanding, and ſet the reaſoning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0032300302:177"/>
at work for means to accompliſh deſire. The mind, by continual exerciſe, ripens to its perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, by the ſame means, is preſerved in vigour. It would have no ſuch exerciſe in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perfection of ſociety; where there would be little to be deſired, and leſs to be dreaded: our mental faculties would for ever lie dormant; and we ſhould remain for ever ignorant that we have ſuch faculties. The people of Paragua are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as mere children in underſtanding. What wonder, conſidering their condition under Jeſuit government, without ambition, without property, without fear of want, and without deſires? The wants of thoſe who inhabit the torrid zone are eaſily ſupplied: they need no cloathing, ſcarce any habitation; and fruits, which ripen there to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, give them food without labouring for it. Need we any other cauſe for their inferiority of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, compared with the inhabitants of other climates, where the mind, as well as body, are conſtantly at work for procuring neceſſaries<note n="*" place="bottom">The bleſſings of eaſe and inaction are moſt poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſplay'd in the following deſcription. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"O felix Lapo, qui in ultimo angulo mundi ſic bene lates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentus et innocens.

That curious writer Mandevil, who is always entertaining, if he does not always inſtruct, exults in maintaining a propoſition ſeemingly paradoxical, That private vices are public benefits. He proves, indeed, moſt triumphantly, that theft produced locks and bars, and that war produced ſwords and guns.

               <p>THE progreſs of government, accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated, would produce a great volume: in this work there is room but for a few hints. What are the means that fit men for ſociety, is explained above; but writers are far from being unanimous about the means that fit them for government. All agree, that ſubmiſſion to our governors is a duty: but they appear to be at a loſs upon what foundation to reſt that duty; as if it were not evident, that by our nature we are fitted for government as well as for ſociety<note n="a" place="bottom">Principles of Equity, p. 177. edit. 2.</note>. If juſtice or veracity be eſſential to ſociety, ſubmiſſion to government is no leſs ſo; and each of theſe equally is declared by the moral ſenſe to be our duty. But to qualify man for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the duty of ſubmiſſion alone is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: diverſity of temper and of talents are alſo neceſſary; and accordingly it is ſo ordered by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that there are never wanting in any ſociety men who are qualified to lead, as well as men who are diſpoſed to follow. Where a number of people convene for any purpoſe, ſome will naturally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume authority without the formality of election, and the reſt will as naturally ſubmit. A regular government, founded on laws, was probably not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0032300302:184"/>
thought of, till people had frequently ſuffered by vicious governors<note n="*" place="bottom">At firſt, when a certain regimen was once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, it may be that all was permitted to the wiſdom and diſcretion of thoſe who were to rule; till by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience this was found very inconvenient, ſo as the thing deviſed for a remedy did increaſe the ſore which it ſhould have cured. They ſaw, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that to live by one man's will became the cauſe of all mens miſery."</q> This conſtrained them to come into laws, wherein all men might ſee their duty beforehand, and know the penalties of tranſgreſſing them. Hooker's Eccl. Pol. I. 1. § 10.</note>.</p>
               <p>During the infancy of national ſocieties, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is extremely ſimple; and no leſs mild than ſimple. No individual is by nature intitled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe magiſterial authority over his fellows; for no individual is born with any mark of pre-eminence to vouch that he has ſuch a privilege. But nature teaches reſpect for men of age and experience; who accordingly take the lead in deliberating and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, leaving execution to the young and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous<note n="†" place="bottom">Such as are acquainted with no manners but what are modern, will be puzzled to account for the great veneration paid to old age in early times. Before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was invented, old men were the repoſitories of knowledge, which they acquired by experience; and young men had no acceſs to knowledge but from them. At the ſiege of Troy, Neſtor, who had ſeen three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, was the chief adviſer and director of the Greeks But as books are now the moſt patent road to knowledge, to which the old and young have acceſs, it may juſtly be obſerved, that by the invention of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and printing, old men have loſt much of their priſtine importance.</note>. War indeed cannot be carried on without a commander; but originally his authority was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to actual war; and he returned home a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

perſon, even when crowned with victory. The wants of men were originally ſo few, and ſo eaſily ſatisfied, as feldom to occaſion a controverſy among members of the ſame tribe. And men, finding vent for their diſſocial paſſions againſt other tribes, were fond to live peaceably at home. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of money made an amazing change. Wealth beſtow'd by fortune, or procured by rapine, made an impreſſion on the vulgar: different ranks were recognized: the rich became imperious, and the poor mutinous. Selfiſhneſs, prevailing over ſocial affection, ſtirred up every man againſt his neighbour; and men, overlooking their natural enemies, gave vent to diſſocial paſſions within their own tribe. It became neceſſary to ſtrengthen the hands of the ſovereign, for repreſſing paſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by opulence, which tend to a diſſolution of ſociety. This ſlight view fairly accounts for the gradual progreſs of government from the milde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the moſt deſpotic. The ſecond part of the progreſs is more pleaſing. Men, long enured to the authority of government, acquire a habit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their turbulent paſſions; and becoming by degrees regular and orderly, they are eaſily reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from doing wrong.</p>
               <p>During the infancy of a ſociety puniſhments muſt be mild; becauſe government has no ſufficient authority over the minds of men to enforce what are ſevere. But government in time acquires au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and when its authority is firmly rooted in the minds of the people, puniſhments more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous can be made effectual; and ſuch puniſhments are neceſſary among a people not yet well diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When men at laſt become regular and orderly under a ſteady adminiſtration, puniſhments become leſs and leſs neceſſary, and the mildeſt are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,<note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſtorical Law-tracts, tract 1.</note>. <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0032300302:186"/>
The Chineſe government is extremely mild, and its puniſhments are in the ſame tone. A capital puniſhment is never inflicted, till the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be examined by a ſovereign court, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Emperor. Thus government, after paſſing through all the intermediate degrees from extreme mildneſs to extreme ſeverity, returns at laſt to its original temper of mildneſs and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<note n="*" place="bottom">An ingenious writer obſerves, that as our Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſettlements are now ſo proſperous, baniſhment to theſe ſettlements is ſcarce a puniſhment. He therefore propoſes, that criminals be tranſported to Hudſon's Bay, or to ſome other uncultivated country. My doubt is, that in proportion as manners improve, the ſeverity of puniſhment ought to be mitigated.

               <head>Different FORMS OF GOVERNMENT compared.</head>
               <p>OF all governments, democracy is the moſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent: deſpotiſm, which benumbs the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculties, and relaxes every ſpring of action, is in the oppoſite extreme. Mixed governments, whether monarchical or republican, ſtand in the middle: they promote activity, but ſeldom any dangerous exceſs.</p>
               <p>Pure democracy, like that of Athens, Argos, and Carthage, is the very worſt form of government, if we make not deſpotiſm an exception. The people, in whom reſides the ſovereign power, are inſolent in proſperity, timid in adverſity, cruel in anger, blind and prodigal in affection, and incapable of embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteadily a prudent meaſure. Thucydides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 5.</note>, that Agis with a gallant army of Spartans ſurrounded the army of Agos; and, though ſecure of victory, ſuffered them to retreat, upon ſolemn aſſurances from Thraſyllus, the Argian general, of terminating all differences in an amicable treaty; Agis, perhaps juſtly, was bitterly cenſured for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering victory to ſlip out of his hands: but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, dreaming of victory when the danger was over, brought their general to trial, confiſcated his effects, and would have ſtoned him to death, had he not taken refuge in a temple. Two Athenian generals, after one naval victory, being intent on a ſecond, deputed Theramenes to perform the laſt duty to their dead. A violent ſtorm prevented
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0032300302:188"/>
Theramenes from executing the truſt repoſed in him; but it did not prevent the people of Athens from putting their two generals to death, as if they had neglected their duty. The fate of Socrates is a ſad inſtance of the changeable, as well as violent, diſpoſition of a democratical ſtate. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, for attempting innovations in the eſtabliſhed religion: the ſentence was groſsly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; for he attempted no innovation; but only, among his friends, expreſſed purer notions of the Deity than were common in Greece at that time. But his funeral obſequies were ſcarce ended, when bitter remorſe ſeized the people. His accuſers were put to death without trial, every perſon baniſhed who had contributed to the ſentence pronounced againſt him, and his ſtatue was erected in the moſt public part of the city. The great Scipio, in his camp near Utica, was ſurrounded with three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian armies, which waited only for day-light to fall upon him. He prevented the impending blow, by ſurpriſing them in the dead of night; which gave him a complete victory. This misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for it could ſcarce be called bad conduct, provoked the democracy of Carthage, to pronounce ſentence of death againſt Aſdrubal their general. Great trading towns cannot flouriſh, if they be not faithful to their engagements, and honeſt in their dealings: Whence then the Fides Punica? A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy is in its nature raſh, violent, and fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Carthaginians merited the reproach, not as individuals, but as a democratical ſtate.</p>
               <p>A commonwealth, governed by the beſt citizens, is very different from a democracy, where the mob rules. At the ſame time, the ſolid foundation of ſuch a commonwealth is, equality among the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Inequality of riches cannot be prevented in a commercial ſtate; but inequality of privileges may be prevented, by excluding no citizen from the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0032300302:189"/>
opportunity of commanding as well as of obeying. The invidious diſtinction of Patrician and Plebeian was a groſs malady in the Roman republic, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſource of diſſenſion between two bodies of men, equally well born, equally rich, and equally fit for war. This ill-poiſed government would have put an end to the republic, had not the Plebeians prevailed, who were the more numerous. That reformation produced to Rome plenty of able men, qualified to govern whether in peace or in war.</p>
               <p>A commonwealth is the beſt form of government for a ſmall ſtate: there is little room for inequality of rank or of property: and the people can act in a body. Monarchy is preferable for a large ſtate, where the people, widely ſpread, cannot be eaſily collected into a body. Attica was a kingdom, while its twelve cantons were remote from each other, and but ſlenderly connected. Theſeus, by collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of figure into the city of Athens, and by a general aſſembly of all the cantons held there, fitted Attica to be a commonwealth.</p>
               <p>When a nation becomes great and populous, it is ill fitted for being a commonwealth. Ambition is apt to trample upon juſtice; ſelfiſhneſs upon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm; and the public is ſacrificed to private views. To prevent corruption from turning incurable, the only remedy is a ſtrict rotation in office, which ought never to be diſpenſed with on any pretext<note n="*" place="bottom">A commonwealth with ſuch a rotation may be apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared to a group of jets d'eau, riſing one above another in beautiful order, and preſerving the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in deſcending: the form of the group continues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable, but the forming parts are always changing.</note>. By ſuch rotation, every citizen in his turn governs and is governed: the higheſt office is limited as to time, and the greateſt men in the ſtate muſt ſubmit to the ſacred law of obeying as well as of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0032300302:190"/>
A man long accuſtomed to power is not happy in a private ſtation: that corrupting habit is prevented by an alternate ſucceſſion of public and private life; which is more agreeable by variety, and contributes no leſs to virtue than to happineſs. It was that form of government in ancient Rome, which produced citizens without number, illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for virtue and talents. Reflect upon Cincinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, eminent among heroes for diſintereſted love to his country. Had he been a Briton, a ſeat in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would have gratified his ambition, as afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt opportunity of ſerving his country. In parliament he joins the party that appears the moſt zealous for the public. Being deceived in his friends, patriots in name only, not in reality, he goes over to the court; and, after fighting the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the miniſtry for years, he is compelled by a ſhattered fortune to accept a poſt or a penſion, Fortunate Cincinnatus! born at a time and in a country where virtue was the paſſport to power and glory. Cincinnatus, after ſerving with honour and reputation as chief magiſtrate, chearfully retired to a private ſtation, in obedience to the laws of his country: nor was that change a hardſhip on a man who was not corrupted by a long habit of power.</p>
               <p>Political writers define a free ſtate to be, where the people are governed by laws of their own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This definition is lame; for laws made by the people are not always juſt. There were many unjuſt laws enacted in Athens during the democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government; and in Britain inſtances are not wanting of laws, not only unjuſt, but oppreſſive. The true definition of a free ſtate is, where the legiſlature adheres ſtrictly to the laws of nature; and calculates everyone of its regulations for improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſociety, and for promoting induſtry and honeſty among the people. If that definition be juſt, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0032300302:191"/>
is the worſt ſpecies of government; being contrived to ſupport arbitrary will in the ſovereign, without regarding the laws of nature, or the good of ſociety. The lawleſs cruelty of a King of Perſia is painted to the life by a ſingle expreſſion of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian grandee, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That every time he left the King's apartment, he was inclined to feel with his hand whether his head was on his ſhoulders."</q> In the Ruſſian empire, men approach the throne with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: the ſlighteſt political intrigue is a ſufficient foundation for baniſhing the greateſt nobleman to Siberia, and for confiſcating his eſtate. The laws of that empire ſmell no leſs rank of ſlavery than of oppreſſion. No perſon dares game with money that bears the impreſſion of the preſent ſovereign: a man going along the ſtreet that fronts the Emperor's apartment, muſt pull off his hat; and it is a hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treſpaſs to write a letter with the Emperor's name in ſmall characters. Deſpotiſm is every where the ſame: it was high treaſon to ſell a ſtatue of a Roman Emperor; and it was doubted, whether it was not high treaſon to hit an Emperor's ſtatue with a ſtone thrown at random<note n="b" place="bottom">l. 5. ad legem Juliam Majeſtatis.</note>. When Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Empreſs of Ruſſia was on death-bed, no perſon durſt enquire about her; and even after her death, it was not at firſt ſafe to ſpeak of it. The deep ſilence of the Ruſſians upon matters of government ariſes from the encouragement given to accuſations of treaſon. The by-ſtanders muſt lay hold of the perſon accuſed: a father arreſts his ſon, a ſon his father, and nature ſuffers in ſilence. The accuſed with the accuſer are hurried to priſon, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main till they be tried in the ſecret court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery. That court, compoſed of a few miniſters named by the Emperor, have the lives and fortunes of all at their mercy. The nobility, ſlaves to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0032300302:192"/>
crown, are prone to retaliate upon their inferiors. They impoſe taxes at pleaſure upon their vaſſals, and frequently ſeize all at ſhort hand<note n="*" place="bottom">The following incident is a ſtriking example of the violence of paſſion, indulged in a deſpotic government, where men in power are under no control. Thomas Pereyra, a Portugueſe general, having aſſiſted the King of Pegu in a dangerous war with his neighbour of Siam, was a prime favourite at court, having elephants of ſtate, and a guard of his own countrymen. One day coming from court mounted on an elephant, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſic in a houſe where a marriage was celebrating between a daughter of the family and her lover, he went into the houſe, and deſired to ſee the bride. The parents took the viſit for a great honour, and chearfully preſented her. He was inſtantly ſmit with her beauty, ordered his guards to ſeize her, and to carry her to his palace. The bridegroom, as little able to bear the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front as to revenge it, cut his own throat.</note>.</p>
               <p>Servility and depreſſion of mind in the ſubjects of a deſpotic government cannot be better marked than in the funeral rites of a Roman Emperor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Herodian<note n="c" place="bottom">Lib. 4.</note>. The body being burnt privately, a waxen image repreſenting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is laid in a bed of ſtate. On the one ſide ſit the ſenators ſeveral hours daily, clothed in black; and on the other, the moſt reſpectable matrons, clothed in white. The ceremony laſts ſeven days, during which the phyſicians from time to time approach the bed, and declare the Emperor to be worſe and worſe. When the day comes of declaring him dead, the moſt dignified of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity carry the bed upon their ſhoulders, and place it in the old forum, where the Roman magiſtrates formerly laid down their office. Then begin dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ditties, ſung to his memory by boys and women. Theſe being ended, the bed is carried to the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0032300302:193"/>
Martius, and there burnt upon a high ſtage with great ſolemnity. When the flames aſcend, an eagle is let looſe, which is ſuppoſed to carry the ſoul of the Emperor to heaven. Is that farce leſs ridiculous than a puppet-ſhew? Is it not much more ridiculous? Dull muſt have been the ſpectator who could behold the ſolemnity without ſmiling at leaſt, if not laughing outright; but the Romans were cruſhed by deſpotiſm, and nothing could provoke them to laugh. That ridiculous farce continued to be acted till the time of Conſtantine: how much later I know not.</p>
               <p>The fineſt countries have been depopulated by deſpotiſm; witneſs Greece, Egypt, and the Leſſer Aſia. The river Menam, in the kingdom of Siam, overflows annually like the Nile, depoſiting a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſlime, which proves a rich manure. The river ſeems to riſe gradually as the rice grows; and retires to its channel when the rice, approaching to maturity, needs no longer to be watered. Nature beſide has beſtowed on that rich country variety of delicious fruits, requiring ſcarce any culture. In ſuch a paradiſe, would one imagine that the Siamites are a miſerable people? The government is deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and the ſubjects are ſlaves: they muſt work for their monarch ſix months every year, without wages, and even without receiving any food from him. What renders them ſtill more miſerable is, that they have no protection either for their perſons or their goods: the grandees are expoſed to the rapacity of the king and his courtiers; and the lower ranks are expoſed to the rapacity of the grandees. When a man has the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to poſſeſs a tree remarkable for good fruit, he is required in the name of the King, or of a courtier, to preſerve the fruit for their uſe. Every proprietor of a garden in the neighbourhood of the capital muſt pay a yearly ſum to the keeper of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0032300302:194"/>
the elephants; otherwiſe it will be laid waſte by theſe animals, whom it is high treaſon to moleſt. From the ſea-port of Mergui to the capital, one travels ten or twelve days through immenſe plains of a rich ſoil, finely watered. That country ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been formerly cultivated, but is now quite depopulated, and left to tigers and elephants. Formerly, an immenſe commerce was carried on in that fertile country: hiſtorians atteſt, that in the middle of the ſixteenth century above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foreign ſhips frequented its ports annually. But the King, tempted with ſo much riches, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to engroſs all the commerce of his country; by which means he annihilated ſucceſſively mines, manufactures, and even agriculture. The country is depopulated, and few remain there but beggars. In the iſland Ceylon, the King is ſole proprietor of the land; and the people are ſupinely indolent: their huts are mean, without any thing like furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: their food is fruit that grows ſpontaneouſly; and their covering is a piece of coarſe cloth, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped round the middle. The ſettlement of the Dutch Eaſt-India company at the Cape of Good Hope is profitable to them in their commerce with the Eaſt Indies; and it would be much more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, if they gave proper encouragement to the tenants and poſſeſſors of their lands. But theſe poor people are ruled with a rod of iron: what the company wants is extorted from them at ſo low a price as ſcarce to afford them common neceſſaries. Avarice, like many other irregular paſſions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs its own gratification: were induſtry duly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, the product of the ground would be in greater plenty, and goods be afforded voluntarily at a lower price than they are at preſent obtained by violence. The Peruvians are a ſad example of the effects of tyranny; being reduced to a ſtate of ſtupid
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0032300302:195"/>
inſenſibility. No motive to action influences them; neither riches, nor luxury, nor ambition: they are even indifferent about life. The ſingle pleaſure they feel is, to get drunk, in order to forget their miſery. The provinces of Moldavia, Walachia, and Beſſarabia, ſituated between the 43d and 48th degrees of latitude, are defended on three ſides by the Nieſter, the Black Sea, and the Danube. The climate of that region, and the fertility of its ſoil, render it not inferior to any other country in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Its paſtures, in particular, are excellent, producing admirable horſes, with an incredible number of ſheep and horned cattle; and its induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial fruits, ſuch as corn, wine, oil, honey, and wax, were formerly produced in great plenty. So populous was that region a few centuries ago, that the prince of Walachia was able, in that province alone, to raiſe an army of ſeventy thouſand men. Yet, notwithſtanding all theſe advantages, the wretched policy of the Turkiſh government has reduced theſe provinces to be almoſt a deſert. A deſpotic government ſtifles, in the birth, all the bounties of nature, and renders the fineſt ſpots of the globe equally ſterile with its barren mountains. When a patriotic king travels about to viſit his dominions, he is received with acclamations of joy. A deſpotic prince dares not hope for ſuch reception: he is locked up in his ſeraglio, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what paſſes; and indolently ſuffers his people to be pillaged, without even hearing of their diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, deſpotiſm, though calculated to elevate the Sovereign above the rules of juſtice, and to make him the only free perſon in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, tends, above all other governments, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him inſecure. He becomes odious by oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and every hand would be raiſed againſt him,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0032300302:196"/>
but for the reſtraint of fear. A ſituation ſo tickliſh lays him open to every bold ſpirit, prompted by revenge to ſeek his ruin, or by ambition to uſurp his throne. In that reſpect, Ruſſia and Turkey are preciſely ſimilar: conſpiracies againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign are equally frequent, and equally ſucceſsful. The moment an uſurper ſeizes the palace, all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions vaniſh: all proſtrate themſelves before the throne, without enquiring about the poſſeſſor's title. In that manner was the preſent Empreſs of Ruſſia eſtabliſhed, notwithſtanding a very unfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable circumſtance, that of dethroning her own huſband Peter III. No free ſpirit regrets ſuch events in a deſpotic government: the only thing to be regretted is, that they concern the monarch only; not the people, who remain abject ſlaves as formerly. The preſent Empreſs, ſenſible of her precarious ſituation, is intent to humanize her people, and to moderate the deſpotiſm. In that view, ſhe has publiſhed a code of laws fit for a limited monarchy, and expreſſing great regard to the lives, liberties, and property of her ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But a monarchy, with all the moderation that deſpotiſm can admit, is inconſiſtent with liberty of the preſs. Political pamphlets, and even news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, are no leſs uſeful for inſtructing the King, than for ſecuring his ſubjects. In France, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry are deprived of that means of acquiring knowledge; and are reduced to the neceſſity of truſting to inſinuating men, who cunningly creep into favour, with a view to their own intereſt. After the late peace, 1763, that miniſtry formed a plan for eſtabliſhing a colony in Guiana; and no fewer than twelve thouſand perſons were landed there all at one time. But ſo groſsly ignorant were they of the preparations neceſſary for planting a colony in the torrid zone, that contagious diſeaſes, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0032300302:197"/>
by unwholeſome food, and want of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, left not a ſingle perſon alive. This could not have happened in England: every article of management would have been canvaſſed, and light would have broke in from every quarter.</p>
               <p>I have inſiſted longer upon the deplorable effects of deſpotiſm than perhaps is neceſſary; but I was fond of the opportunity to juſtify, or rather applaud the ſpirit of liberty ſo eminent in the inhabitants of Britain. I now proceed to compare different forms of government, with reſpect to various parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; beginning with patriotiſm. Every form of government muſt be good that inſpires patriotiſm; and the beſt form to invigorate that noble paſſion is a commonwealth founded on rotation of power, where it is the ſtudy of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in office to do good, and to merit approbation from their fellow-citizens. In the Swiſs Cantons, the ſalaries of magiſtrates and public officers are ſcarce ſufficient to defray their expences; and thoſe worthy perſons deſire no other recompence, but to be eſteemed and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="*" place="bottom">No human work can be everlaſting. The ſeventy-two bailiages of the extenſive canton of Bern threaten ruin to the republic. Thoſe lucrative offices, which the great council appropriates to its own members, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a conſtant influx of riches into the capital. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm is obſerved, of late years, to be on the decline among the citizens of Bern; and no wonder, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that luxury and ſelfiſhneſs are the never-failing off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of opulence. When ſelfiſhneſs becomes the ruling paſſion of that people, thoſe in power will pilfer the public treaſure, which is immenſe, and enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſpoils of the republic. Confuſion and anarchy muſt enſue, and the ſtate will ſettle in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or, more probably, in an odious democracy.</note>. A republic ſo modelled inſpires virtues of every ſort. The people of Switzerland ſeldom
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0032300302:198"/>
think of writing to confirm a bargain: a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit is ſcarce known among them; and many there are who have never heard of an advocate nor of an attorney. Their doors are never ſhut but in winter. It is patriotiſm that Monteſquieu has in view, when he pronounces virtue to be the leading principle in a republic. He has reaſon to term it ſo, becauſe patriotiſm is connected with every ſocial virtue; and, when it vaniſhes, men regard themſelves only, not their fellow-citizens. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy will never be recommended by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened politician, as a good form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; were it for no other reaſon, but that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm cannot long ſubſiſt where the mob go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns. In monarchy, the king is exalted ſo high above his ſubjects, that his miniſters are little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſervants. Such condition is not friendly to patriotiſm: it is as little friendly to ambition; for miniſters are ſtill ſervants, however much raiſed above other ſubjects. Wealth, being the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining purſuit, promotes avarice to be their ruling paſſion. Now, if patriotiſm be not found in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who have power, far leſs in men who have no power; and thus in monarchy, riches are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before virtue, and every vicious offspring of avarice has free courſe.</p>
               <p>Without piercing to the foundation, one can have no juſt notion of the various forms that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment aſſumes in different ſtates. Monarchy is of many different kinds, and ſo is a republic. Rome and Carthage, the two great rival republics of ancient times, differed widely in their original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Much has been ſaid of theſe republics by hiſtorians and political writers. There is one point of compariſon that will ſet in a clear light the difference of their conſtitutions, with reſpect to peace and war. Carthage, advantageouſly ſituated
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0032300302:199"/>
for commerce, became a great and flouriſhing trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town. The Carthaginians, having no object but riches, admitted none into a participation of their privileges. War was againſt their genius: but conqueſt was not, if it produced wealth; and therefore they made war in order to load their new ſubjects with taxes. Rome, on the contrary, was ill ſituated for commerce: its inhabitants were, from the beginning, employed in war, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive or offenſive. Their great object accordingly was power; to which end they were always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to adopt, as citizens, the beſt of thoſe they conquered. Thus Rome became a city of warriors, Carthage of merchants. The ſubjects of the latter were always ripe for a revolt, while the ſubjects of the former were always faithful. Between two ſuch ſtates there could be no equality in war; and, had the Carthaginians been as ſkilful in politics as they were in commerce, they would have avoided, with the ſtricteſt circumſpection, every occaſion of quarrel with the Romans. Rome employed its own citizens in war: Carthage had none to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy but mercenaries. In an offenſive war, the object of the latter was riches; that of the former was power and glory, motives much ſuperior, and more animating. In a defenſive war, the difference is infinite between mercenaries, who have no intereſt but to receive their pay, and citizens, who fight for their country, and for their wives and children. What then are we to think of Hannibal, who, reverſing the laws of nature, carried on war againſt the Romans with an army of mercenaries, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in every engagement, and brought them to the very brink of ruin? He certainly was the greateſt General the world ever ſaw. If any one is to be excepted, it is the preſent King of Pruſſia.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0032300302:200"/>
I next compare different forms of government, with reſpect to the influence of opulence. Riches, which, joined with ambition, produce bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for power, are, however, not dangerous in monarchy, where the ſovereign is ſo far ſuperior, as to humble to the duſt the moſt aſpiring of his ſubjects. But riches, joined with ambition, are dangerous in a republic: ambition will ſuggeſt the poſſibility of ſowing diſſention among the leaders; riches will make the attempt ſucceſsful; and then adieu to the republic. Wealth, accumulated by commerce in Carthage and in Athens, extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriotiſm, and rendered their democracy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, violent, and tyrannical. It had another bad effect; which was, to make them ambitious of conqueſt. The ſage Plutarch charges Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with the ruin of Athens. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That great man,"</q> ſays he <q rend="inline margQuotes">"inſpired his countrymen with deſire of naval power. That power produced extenſive commerce, and, conſequently, riches: riches again, beſide luxury, inſpired the Athenians with a high opinion of their power, and made them raſhly engage in every quarrel among their neighbours."</q> Suppreſs the names, and one will believe it to be a cenſure on the conduct of Britain. Succeſsful commerce prompted the Carthaginians, againſt their natural intereſt, to make war for gain. Had they been ſucceſsful againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, both nations would have fallen a ſacrifice to the ambition of Hannibal: after ſubduing Italy, what Carthaginian durſt have oppoſed the glorious conqueror, returning with a victorious army, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his will? That event was long dreaded by Hanno, and the wiſer part of the Carthaginian ſenate; and hence their ſcanty ſupplies to Hannibal. But what is only a ſuppoſition with reſpect to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage proved to be the fate of Rome. Inequality
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0032300302:201"/>
of rank, opulence, and luxury, relaxed every fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle of the commonwealth, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly rotation of power, which ought to have been their palladium. Conqueſt at a diſtance led them unwarily, in ſome inſtances, to ſuſpend that fundamental law, of which Caeſar avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in his Gallic war, by debauching from their duty the beſt diſciplined army of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public: and it was that army, under a leader little inferior to Hannibal, which determined the fate of Rome.</p>
               <p>A ſtate with a ſmall territory, ſuch as Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh or Holland, may ſubſiſt long as a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, without much hazard from the opulence of individuals. But an extenſive territory in the hands of a few opulent proprietors is dangerous in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; becauſe of their influence over num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who depend on them for bread. The iſland of Britain is too large for a commonwealth. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to a profound political writer<note n="a" place="bottom">Harrington.</note>, who does honour to his country; and to remedy the evil, he propoſes an Agrarian law. But it is vain to think, that accumulation of land can be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Agrarian law: a truſt-deed is a ready ſcreen for covering accumulation beyond law: and dark tranſactions will be carried on without end; ſimilar to what is practiſed, moſt diſhoneſtly, by thoſe who elect and are elected members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. When ſuch comes to be the condition of land-property, the Agrarian law will be ripe for diſſolution.</p>
               <p>In early times we diſcover greater variety of character than at preſent; among ſovereigns eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, who are not taught to govern their paſſions.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0032300302:202"/>
Peruſing the Hiſtory of Spain in particular, one is ſtruck with an amazing variety of character in the Mooriſh Kings. In ſome of them, outrageous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; in others, mildneſs, and affection for their people: in ſome, unbounded ambition, ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every obſtacle of juſtice and humanity; in others, ſtrict attention to commerce, and to every moral virtue; ſome heaping up treaſure; ſome ſquandering all upon voluptuouſneſs; ſome culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating peace; ſome fond of war. During the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of ſociety, men exert their natural bias with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve: in the progreſs of ſociety, they are taught to moderate their turbulent paſſions: at laſt, mild and courtly behaviour, produced by education and imitation, give an air to men of figure, as if they were all copies from one original; which is peculiarly the caſe in France. The mildneſs of external behaviour muſt have a conſiderable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the internal part; for nothing tends more to ſoften or to ſuppreſs a paſſion, than never to give it vent; and, for that reaſon, abſolute monarchy in France is far from being ſo dreadful as it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. It is at preſent far from being violent or ſanguinary; the manners of the people having the ſame influence there, that laws have in a free country. The King, delicate with reſpect to his conduct, and dreading the cenſure of the world, is guilty of few exceſſes; and the people, tame and ſubmiſſive, are eaſily kept in order. Among men of rank, to be diſcharged the court, or to be rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to their country-ſeats, is more terrible than a capital puniſhment.</p>
               <p>We finiſh this ſhort eſſay with a compariſon of different governments, as to the execution of laws. Laws relative to property and pecuniary intereſt are every where preſerved in vigour, becauſe the violation of them hurts many. Laws reſpecting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0032300302:203"/>
the public are kept alive in monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; becauſe the King, to whom execution of law is intruſted, ſeldom benefits by their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. For a ſteady execution of ſuch laws, a democracy has nothing to rely on but patriotiſm; and when that ſubſides, ſuch laws fall aſleep. The reaſon is, that the powers, both of legiſlature and execution, center in the people; and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, frequently no better than a mob, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with conſtancy direct execution againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <head>PROGRESS OF STATES from ſmall to great, and from great to ſmall.</head>
               <p>WHEN tribes, originally ſmall, ſpread wider and wider by population, till they become neighbours, the ſlighteſt differences enflame mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual averſion, and inveſtigate hoſtilities that never end. Weak tribes unite for defence againſt the powerful, and become inſenſibly one people: other tribes are ſwallowed up by conqueſt. And thus ſtates become more and more extenſive, till they are confined by ſeas and mountains. Spain origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally contained many ſmall ſtates, which were all brought under the Roman yoke. In later times, it was again poſſeſſed by many ſtates, Chriſtian and Mahometan, continually at war, till by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt they were united in one great kingdom. Portugal ſtill maintains its independency, a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it owes to the weakneſs of Spain, not to advantage of ſituation. The ſmall ſtates of Italy were ſubdued by the Romans; and thoſe of Greece by Philip of Macedon, and his ſon Alexander. Scotland eſcaped narrowly the paws of Edward I. of England; and would at laſt have been conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its more potent neighbour, had not conqueſt been prevented by a federal union.</p>
               <p>But at that rate, have we not reaſon to dread the union of all nations under one univerſal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch? There are ſeveral cauſes that for ever will
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0032300302:205"/>
prevent a calamity ſo dreadful. The local ſituation of ſome countries, defended by ſtrong natural barriers, is one of theſe. Bitain is defended by the ſea; and ſo is Spain, except where divided from France by the Pyrenean mountains. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in general, by many barriers of ſeas, rivers, and mountains, is fitted for ſtates of moderate extent: not ſo Aſia, which, being divided into very large portions, is prepared by nature for extenſive monarchies<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">En Aſie on a toujours vu de grands empires; en Europe ils n'ont jamais pu ſubſiſter. C'eſt que l'Aſie que nous connoiſſons a de plus grandes plaines: elle eſt coupée en plus grands morceaux par les montagnes et les mers; et comme elle eſt plus au midi, les ſources y ſont plus aiſement taries, les montagnes y ſont moins couvertes des nieges, et les fleuves, moins groſſis, y for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment des moindres barriers.</q> (L'Eſprit des Loix, liv. 17. c. 6.)—[In Engliſh thus: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In Aſia there have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been great empires: ſuch could never ſubſiſt in Europe. The reaſon is, that in Aſia there are larger plains, and it is cut by mountains and ſeas into more extenſive diviſions: as it lies more to the ſouth, its ſprings are more eaſily dried up, the mountains are leſs covered with ſnow, and the rivers, proportionally ſmaller, form leſs conſiderable barriers."]</q>
                  </note>. Ruſſia is the only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Europe; a weak kingdom by ſituation, though rendered formidable by the extraordinary talents of one man, and of more than one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>A ſecond cauſe is, the weakneſs of a great ſtate. The ſtrength of a ſtate doth not increaſe with its bulk, more than that of a man. An overgrown empire, far from being formidable to its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, falls to pieces by its weight and unwieldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Its frontiers are not eaſily guarded: witneſs France, which is much weakened by that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0032300302:206"/>
though its greater part is bounded by the ſea. Patriotiſm vaniſhes in a great monarchy: the provinces have no mutual connection; and the diſtant provinces, which muſt be governed by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws, are always ripe for a revolt. To ſecure Nicomedia, which had frequently ſuffered by fire, Pliny ſuggeſted to the Emperor Trajan, a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company of one hundred and fifty men. So infirm at that period was the Roman empire, that Trajan durſt not put the project in execution, fearing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances even from that ſmall body.</p>
               <p>The chief cauſe is the luxury and effeminacy of a great monarchy, which leave no appetite for war, either in the ſovereign, or in his ſubjects. Great inequality of rank in an extenſive kingdom, occaſioned by a conſtant flow of riches in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, introduces ſhow, expenſive living, luxury, and ſenſuality. Riches, by affording gratification to every ſenſual appetite, become an idol, to which all men bow the knee; and when riches are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as a paſſport to power, as well as to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they corrupt the heart, eradicate every virtue, and foſter every vice. In ſuch diſſolution of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, contradictions are reconciled; avarice and meanneſs unite with vanity; diſſimulation and cunning, with ſplendor. Where ſubjects are ſo corrupted, what will the prince be, who is not taught to moderate his paſſions, who meaſures juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by appetite, and who is debilitated by corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real pleaſures? Such a prince never thinks of heading his own troops, nor of extending his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Moſtazen, the laſt Califf of Bagdat, is a conſpicuous inſtance of the degeneracy deſcribed. His kingdom being invaded by the Tartars in the year 1258, he ſhut himſelf up in his ſeraglio with his debauched companions, as in profound peace; and, ſtupified with ſloth and voluptuouſneſs, was
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0032300302:207"/>
the only perſon who appeared careleſs about the fate of his empire. A King of Perſia, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the Turks had made themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his beſt provinces, anſwered, that he was indifferent about their ſucceſs, provided they would not diſturb him in his city of Iſpahan. Hoatſang, the laſt Chineſe Emperor of the Chineſe race, hid himſelf in his palace, while the Tartars were wreſting from him his northern provinces, and Liſtching, a rebel mandarine, was wreſting from him the remainder. The Empreſs ſtrangled herſelf in her apartment; and the Emperor, making a laſt effort, followed her example. The ninth Chineſe Emperor of the blood of Genhizcan, addicted to women and prieſts, was deſpiſed by his people. A perſon without a name, who had been a ſervant in a convent of Bonzes, putting himſelf at the head of ſome robbers, dethroned the monarch, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the royal family.</p>
               <p>The Tonquineſe, after a long ſubjection to the Emperor of China, regained their independence, and were governed by kings of their own nation. Theſe princes having, by long peace, become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent, luxurious, and effeminate, abandoned the government of the kingdom to their miniſters. The governor of Cochin-china, being at a great diſtance from the capital, revolted firſt, and that country became a ſeparate kingdom. The gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Tonquin, within which province the King reſided, uſurped the ſovereignty: but, reſpecting the royal family, he only locked up the King in his palace; leaving to the King's deſcendents the name of BOVA, or King, with ſome ſhadow of royalty. The Uſurper and his ſucceſſors content themſelves with the title of CHOVA, or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo; which ſatisfies the people, who pierce no deeper than what eye-ſight diſcovers. A revolution
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0032300302:208"/>
of the ſame kind happened in Japan. Similar cauſes produce ſimilar effects. The luxurious and indolent ſucceſſors of Charlemagne in the kingdom of France, truſting their power and authority with the mairs of their palace, were never ſeen in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and were ſeldom heard of. The great power of theſe officers inflamed them with an appetite for more. Pepin and his ſucceſſors were for a long time kings de facto, leaving to the rightful ſovereign nothing but the empty name.

               <p>Little reaſon, then, have we to apprehend the coalition of all nations into an univerſal monarchy. We ſee, indeed, in the hiſtory of mankind, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances of the progreſs of nations from ſmall to great; but we ſee alſo inſtances, no leſs frequent, of extenſive monarchies being ſplit into many ſmall ſtates. Such is the courſe of human affairs: ſtates are ſeldom ſtationary; but, like the ſun, are either advancing to their meridian, or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down gradually, till they ſink into obſcurity. An empire, ſubjected to effeminate princes, and devoid of patriotiſm, cannot long ſubſiſt entire. The fate of all, with very few exceptions, has been uniformly the ſame. The governors of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, loſing all regard for a voluptuous and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate monarch, take courage, ſet up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and aſſume regal authority, each in his own
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0032300302:210"/>
province. The puiſſant Aſſyrian monarchy, one of the earlieſt we read of in hiſtory, after having been long a terror to its neighbours, was diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered by the governors of Media and of Babylon, who detached theſe extenſive provinces from the monarchy. Mahomet and his immediate ſucceſſors erected a great empire, of which Bagdat became the capital. The latter Califfs of that race, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with ſenſual pleaſure, loſt all vigour of mind, and ſunk down into ſloth and effeminacy. The governors of the diſtant provinces were the firſt who ventured to declare themſelves indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Their ſucceſs invited other governors, who ſtripped the Califf of his remaining provinces, leaving him nothing but the city of Bagdat; and of that he was deprived by the Tartars, who put an end to that once illuſtrious monarchy. The ſame would have been the fate of the Perſian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, had it not been ſubdued by Alexander of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon. But, after his death, it ſubmitted to the ordinary fate: his generals aſſumed regal power, each of them in the province he governed. Had not the Roman empire been diſmembered by the Barbarians, it would have been diſmembered by the governors of its provinces. The weakneſs of Charlemagne's ſucceſſors hatched in France and in Germany an endleſs number of petty ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns. About the time that a paſſage to the Eaſt-Indies by the Cape of Good Hope was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the great peninſula beyond the Ganges was comprehended under the powerful empire of Biſnagar. Its firſt monarchs had eſtabliſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by valour and military knowledge. In war, they headed their troops: in peace, they directed their miniſters, viſited their dominions, and were punctual in rendering juſtice to high and low. The people carried on an extenſive and lucrative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0032300302:211"/>
which brought a revenue to the Emperor, that enabled him to maintain a ſtanding army of one hundred thouſand foot, thirty thouſand horſe, and ſeven hundred elephants. But proſperity and opulence ruined all. The Emperors, poiſoned with pride and voluptuouſneſs, were now contented with ſwelling titles, inſtead of ſolid fame. King of kings, and Huſband of a thouſand wives, were at the head of a long catalogue of ſuch pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous, but empty epithets. Corrupted by flattery, they affected divine honours, and appeared rarely in public; leaving the care of their dominions to their miniſters, and to the governors of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. At the beginning of the ſixteenth century, neighbouring princes encroached on all ſides. In the year 1565, Biſnagar, the capital, was taken and ſacked by four Mooriſh kings. The governors of the provinces declared themſelves independent; and out of that great empire ſprung the kingdoms of Golconda, Viſapour, and ſeveral others. The empire of Hindoſtan, once widely extended, is now reduced to a very ſmall kingdom, under a prince, who no longer is intitled to be deſigned the Great Mogul; the governors of his provinces having, as uſual, declared themſelves independent.</p>
               <p>Our North-American colonies are in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition, increaſing rapidly in population and in opulence. The coloniſts have the ſpirit of a free people, and are enflamed with patriotiſm. Their population will equal that of Britain and Ireland in leſs than a century; and they will then be a match for the mother-country, if they chuſe to be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent: every advantage will be on their ſide, as the attack muſt be by ſea, from a very great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Being thus delivered from a foreign yoke, their firſt care will be, the choice of a proper go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and it is not difficult to foreſee what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0032300302:212"/>
will be choſen. A people, animated with the new bleſſings of liberty and independence, will not incline to a kingly government. The Swiſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons joined in a federal union, for protection againſt the potent houſe of Auſtria; and the Dutch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the like union, for protection againſt the more potent King of Spain. But our colonies will never join in ſuch a union; becauſe they have no potent neighbour, and becauſe they have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to each other. We may pronounce then, with tolerable certainty, that each colony will chuſe for itſelf a republican government. And their preſent conſtitution prepares them for it: they have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and they have an aſſembly repreſenting the people. No change will be neceſſary, but to drop the governor, who repreſents the King of Britain. And thus a part of a great ſtate will be converted into many ſmall ſtates.</p>

On Spain, which formeryl conſiſted of many ſmall ſtates, a profound writer<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Robertſon.</note> makes the following obſervation. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The petty monarch was but little elevated above his nobles: having little power, he could not command much reſpect; nor could his nobles look up to him with that reverence which is felt in approaching great monarchs."</q> Another thing is equally weighty againſt deſpotiſm in a ſmall ſtate: the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cannot eaſily be ſeparated from the people; and

for that reaſon, is very little dangerous. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pretorian bands were billeted in the towns near Rome; and three cohorts only were employed in guarding that city. Sejanus, perfect of theſe bands under Tiberius, lodged the three cohorts in a ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous barrack within the city, in order to gain more authority over them, and to wean them from fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with the people. Tacitus, in the 4th book of his Annals, relates the ſtory in the following words. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Vim praefecturae modicam antea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendit, diſperſas per urbem cohortes una in caſtra conducendo; ut ſimul imperia acciperent, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroque et robore, et viſu, inter ſe, fiducia ipſis, in caeteros metus, crearetur<note n="*" place="bottom">

That of many attempts to uſurp the ſovereignty of different Greek republics, very few ſucceeded; and that no uſurpation of that kind was laſting. Every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance differs in an extenſive ſtate: the people, at a diſtance from the throne, and having profound veneration for the ſovereign, conſider themſelves, not as members of a body-politic, but as ſubjects merely, bound implicitly to obey: by which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they are prepared beforehand for deſpotiſm. Other reaſons concur: the ſubjects of a great ſtate are dazzled with the ſplendor of their monarch; and as their union is prevented by diſtance, the monarch can ſafely employ a part of his ſubjects againſt the reſt, or a ſtanding army againſt all.</p>

A great ſtate poſſeſſes one eminent advantage, viz. ability to execute magnificent works. The hanging gardens of Babylon, the pyramids of Egypt, and its lake Meris, are illuſtrious examples. The city of Heliopolis in Syria, named Balbek by the Turks, is a pregnant inſtance of the power and opulence of the Roman empire. Even in the ruins of that city, there are remains of great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and exquiſite taſte. If the imperial palace, or the temple of the Sun, to mention no other building, were the work of any European prince exiſting at preſent, it would make a capital figure in the annals of his reign. And yet ſo little eclat did theſe works make at the time of execution, that there is not a hint of them in any hiſtorian. The beneficence of ſome great monarchs is worthy of ſtill greater praiſe. In the principal roads of Japan hot baths are erected at proper diſtances, with other conveniencies, for the uſe of travellers. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence of the Chineſe government to thoſe who ſuffer ſhipwreck, gives a more advantageous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that monarchy, than all that is painfully collected by Du Halde. To verify the obſervation, I joyfully lay hold of the following incident. In the year 1728, the ſhip Prince George took her departure from Calcutta in Bengal for Canton in China, with a cargo L. 60,000 value. A violent ſtorm drove her aſhore at a place named Timpau, a great way weſt from Canton. Not above half the crew could make the ſhore, worn out with fatigue and hunger, and not doubting of being maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred by the natives. How amazed were they to be treated with remarkable humanity! A mandarin appeared, who not only provided for them victuals in plenty, but alſo divers to aſſiſt them in fiſhing the wreck. What follows is in the words of my author, Alexander Wedderburn of St. Germains, a gentleman of known worth and veracity, who bore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0032300302:216"/>
office in the ſhip. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In a few days we recovered L. 5000 in bullion, and afterward L. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>,000 more. Before we ſet forward to Canton, the mandarin our benefactor took an exact account of our money, with the names of the men, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with an eſcort to conduct us through his diſtrict, and conſigned us dead or alive to one Suqua at Canton, a Chineſe merchant well known to the Engliſh there. In every one of our reſting-places, victuals were brought to us by the villagers in plenty, and with great cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. In this manner we paſſed from one diſtrict to another, without having occaſion to lay out a ſingle farthing, till we reached Canton, which we did in nine days, travelling ſometimes by land, and ſometimes by water. Our caſe had been repreſented to the court at Pekin, from whence orders came to diſtribute amongſt us a ſum of money; which was done by the Chuntuck, Hoppo, and other officers, civil and military, aſſembled in great ſtate. After a ſhort ſpeech, expreſſing regret for our calamity, with an eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium on the humane and generous diſpoſition of their maſter; to each of us was preſented the Emperor's bounty, in a yellow bag, on which was inſcribed the nature of the gift. The firſt ſupercargo received 450 tales in ſilver, the ſecond 350, myſelf 250, the mate 75, and each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeamen 15; the whole amounting to about 2000 tales, or L. 800. This is an example worthy imitation, even where Chriſtianity is profeſſed; though its tenets are often, on like occaſions, ſcandalouſly perverted."</q> So far my author: and I add, that this bounty was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly eſtabliſhed by law; for it has not the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an occaſional or ſingular act of benevolence. If ſo, China is the only country in the world,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0032300302:217"/>
where charity to ſtrangers in diſtreſs is a branch of public police.</p>
               <p>Another advantage of a great ſtate I mention with peculiar pleaſure, becauſe all who aſpire to be eminent in literature, are intereſted in it. A ſmall kingdom, like Denmark, like Sweden, like Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, cannot naturally be productive of good writers; becauſe where there are few readers, there is no ſufficient incitement to exert literary talents: a claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical work produced at preſent in the Celtic lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, would be little leſs than a miracle. France is eminent above all other nations for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement it affords to good writers: it is a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous country; it is the chief ſeat of taſte, arts, and ſciences; and its language has become univerſal in Europe, being the court-language every where: what wonder then is it, that French writers carry the palm? But let not the Britiſh deſpond; for doth not a glorious proſpect lie before them? The demand for Engliſh books in America is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and is increaſing daily. Population goes on vigorouſly: the number of Britiſh already ſettled upon the river Ohio approach to 10,000; and the delicious country from that river down to the mouth of the Miſſiſſippi, will be filled with people whoſe native tongue is Engliſh. What reaſon is there to doubt, but that ſo fine a climate and ſo rich a ſoil will be productive of readers in plenty? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſo many readers, though in diſtant parts of the globe, muſt rouſe our ambition; and our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will be happily directed, if we lay aſide all local diſtinctions, and aſpire to rival the French writers in real merit only.</p>
               <p>But the foregoing advantages of a great ſtate, however illuſtrious, are ſadly overbalanced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold diſadvantages. The firſt is, the corruption of its kings, which, with a different view, is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſketch immediately preceding. And
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0032300302:218"/>
beſide corruption, there is another diſadvantage that great monarchs are ſubjected to; which is, that being highly elevated above their ſubjects, they are acquainted with none but their miniſters. And miniſters, who, in a deſpotic government, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no controul but that of their maſter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prefer their own intereſt, without regard to his honour. Solyman Emperor of the Turks, tho' accompliſhed above any of his predeceſſors, could not eſcape the artifices of his wife Roxalana, and of his Viſir Ruſtan. They poiſoned his ears with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated calumnies againſt his eldeſt ſon Muſtapha, a young prince of great hopes. They were not in hazard of detection, becauſe no perſon had acceſs to the Emperor but by their means. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſcene was an order from the Emperor to put his ſon to death<note n="b" place="bottom">See Dr. Robertſon's hiſtory of Charles V. where this incident is related with uncommon ſpirit.</note>. If a great monarch lies thus open in his own palace to the artifices of his miniſters, his authority, we may be certain, will be very ſlight over the governors of his diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Their power is precarious; and they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the people without intermiſſion, in order to amaſs wealth: the complaints of the people are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded; for they can never reach the throne. The Spaniſh governors of the Philippine iſlands afford a deplorable inſtance of this obſervation. The heat of the climate promotes luxury: and luxury prompts avarice, which rages without controul, the diſtance of the capital removing all fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Arbitrary taxes are impoſed on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and exceſſive duties on goods imported, which are rigorouſly exacted, and converted by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to his own uſe. An arbitrary eſtimate is made of what every field may produce; and the huſbandman is ſeverely puniſhed if he ſail to deliver
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0032300302:219"/>
the appointed quantity, whether his land has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it or not. Many thouſands have abandoned their native country; and the few miſerable wretches who remain, have taken refuge among inacceſſible mountains.</p>
               <p>The corruption of a court ſpreads through every member of the ſtate. In an extenſive kingdom, powerful above its neighbours, the ſubjects, having no occaſion to exert themſelves in defence of their country, loſe their manhood, and become cowards. At the ſame time, great inequality of rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune engender luxury, ſelfiſhneſs, and ſenſuality<note n="*" place="bottom">The following paſſage is from a late Ruſſian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"It is a truth founded on experience, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce poliſhes manners: but it is alſo a truth, that commerce, by exciting luxury, corrupts manners. With the increaſe of foreign faſhions and foreign commerce in Ruſſia, foreign luxury has increaſed there in proportion, univerſal diſſipation has taken the lead, and profligacy of manners has followed. Great landlords ſqueeze and grind their people, to ſupply the inceſſant demands of luxury: the miſerable pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, diſabled by a load of taxes, is frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to abandon his habitation, and to leave his land uncultivated. And thus agriculture and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation diminiſh daily; than which nothing worſe can befal a ſtate."</q>
                  </note>. The fine arts, it is true, gain ground, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are perfected, and courtly manners prevail: but every manly virtue is gone; and not a ſoul to be found, who will venture his life to ſave his country. That diſeaſe is ſpreading in Britain; and the only circumſtance that guards France from equal puſillanimity, is an eſtabliſhed mode, that every gentleman muſt ſerve ſome campaigns in the army.</p>
               <p>A third diſadvantage of an extenſive monarchy is, that it is liable to internal convulſions or revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0032300302:220"/>
occaſioned commonly either by a ſtanding army, or by the governors of diſtant provinces. With reſpect to the former, the government of a great kingdom, enervated by luxury, will always be military, and conſequently deſpotic. A nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous army will ſoon learn to contemn a puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous leader, and to break looſe from every tie of ſubjection: the ſovereign is often changed at the caprice of the army; but deſpotiſm continues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable. In Turky, Janiſaries dethrone the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, without ſcruple; but being ſuperſtitiouſly attached to the royal family, they confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it in electing a new Sultan. The Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian bands were the Janiſſaries of the Roman empire, who never ſcrupled to dethrone the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror on the ſlighteſt diſobligation. But as there was no royal family, they commonly carried the crown to market, and beſtowed it on the higheſt bidder. With reſpect to the latter, the governors of diſtant provinces, accuſtomed to act without controul, become fond of power, and put no bounds to ambition. Let them but gain the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people they govern, and boldneſs will do the reſt. The monarch is dethroned before he is prepared for defence, and the uſurper takes his place without oppoſition. Succeſs commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch undertakings; for the ſovereign has no ſoul, and the people have no patriotiſm. In Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan, formerly, ſome diſcontented favourite or ſouba took up arms to avenge fancied, or perhaps affected wrongs: venturing not however upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, he ſcreened himſelf with ſetting up ſome perſon of the royal blood, whom he proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſovereign. The voluptuouſneſs and effeminacy of the late kings of Perſia have rendered that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a prey to every bold invader. There perhaps never exiſted a ſtate that ſo often has changed its maſter, as Perſia has done of late years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0032300302:221"/>
In the fourth place, a nation corrupted with luxury and ſenſuality is a ready morſel for every invader: to attempt the conqueſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſucceed, are almoſt the ſame. The potent Aſſyrian monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, having long ſubſiſted in peace without a ſingle enemy, ſunk into ſloth and effeminacy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an eaſy prey to the kings of Media and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. Theſe two nations, in like circumſtances of ſloth and effeminacy, were in their turn ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up by Cyrus King of Perſia. And the great empire of Perſia, running the ſame courſe, was ſubdued by Alexander of Macedon with a ſmall army of thirty five thouſand men<note n="*" place="bottom">In Europe, neighbouring nations differ little in manners, or in fortitude. In Aſia, we ſtep inſtantly from the fierce Tartars, inhabiting a cold and barren country, to the effeminate people of a countty warm and fertile. Hence in Aſia perpetual conqueſts from north to ſouth, to which even the great wall of China makes ſcarce any obſtacle.</note>.</p>
               <p>And this leads to a fifth diſadvantage of a great empire, which is, the difficulty of guarding its frontiers. A kingdom, like an animal, becomes weak in proportion to its exceſs above a certain ſize. France and Spain would be leſs fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, were they enlarged beyond their preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Spain in particular was a very weak kingdom, while it comprehended the Netherlands and the half of Italy. In their preſent ſize, forces are ſoon collected to guard the moſt diſtant frontiers. Months are required to aſſemble troops in an overgrown kingdom like Perſia: if an army be defeated at the frontier, it muſt diſperſe, fortified places being ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within reach. The victor, advancing with celerity, lays ſiege to the capital, before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial troops can be formed into a regular army: the capital is taken, the empire diſſolved, and the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0032300302:222"/>
conqueror at leiſure diſputes the provinces with their governors. The Philippine iſlands made formerly a part of the extenſive empire of China; but as they were too diſtant to be protected, or well governed, it ſhow'd conſummate wiſdom in the Chineſe government to abandon them, with ſeveral other diſtant provinces.</p>
               <p>A ſmall ſtate, on the other hand, is eaſily guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Greek republics thought themſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently fortified againſt the Great King, by their courage, their union, and their patriotiſm. The Spaniſh Chriſtians, beat out of the open country by the Saracens, retired to the mountains of Aſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and elected Don Pelayo to be their King. That warlike prince walled none of his towns, nor did he fortify a ſingle paſs; knowing, that while his people were brave, they would be invincible; and that walls and ſtrong-holds ſerve but to abate courage. The Romans, while circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Italy, never thought of any defence againſt an enemy but good troops. When they had acquired a vaſt empire, even the Rhine appeared a barrier too weak: the numberleſs forts and legions that covered their frontiers could not defend them from a panic upon every motion of the barbarians<note n="*" place="bottom">The uſe of cannon, which place the weak and ſtrong upon a level, is the only reſource of the luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and opulent againſt the poor and hardy.</note>. A nation in which the reciprocal duties of ſovereign and ſubject are conſcientiouſly fulfilled, and in which the people love their country and their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, may be deemed invincible; provided due care be taken of the military branch. Every particular is reverſed in a great empire: individuals graſp at money, per fas aut nefas, to laviſh it upon pleaſure: the governors of diſtant provinces tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize without control, and, during the ſhort period
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0032300302:223"/>
of their power, neglect no means, however op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, to amaſs wealth. Thus were the Roman provinces governed; and the people, who could not figure a greater tyrant than a Roman proconſul, were ready to embrace every change. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans accordingly were ſenſible, that to force their barrier, and to diſmember their empire, were in effect the ſame. In our times the nations, whoſe frontiers lie open, would make the moſt reſolute ſtand againſt an invader; witneſs the German ſtates, and the Swiſs cantons. Italy enjoys the ſtrongeſt natural barrier of any country that is not an iſland; and yet for centuries has been a prey to every invader.</p>
               <p>Two methods have been practiſed for ſecuring the frontiers of an extenſive empire: one is to lay the frontiers waſte; the other is, to eſtabliſh feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory princes in the diſtant provinces. Sha Abbas, King of Perſia, in order to prevent the inroads of the Turks, laid waſte part of Armenia, carrying the inhabitants to Iſpahan, and treating them with great humanity. Land is not much valued by the great monarchs of Aſia: it is precious in the ſmaller kingdoms of Europe, and the frontiers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly guarded by fortified towns. The other frontiers of Perſia are guarded by feudatory princes; and he ſame method is practiſed in China, in Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſtan, and in the Turkiſh empire. The princes of Little Tartary, Moldavia, and Wallachia, have been long a ſecurity to the Grand Signior againſt his powerful neighbours in Europe.</p>

                     <p>In the war carried on by Lewis XII. of France againſt the Venetians, the town of Breſcia being taken by ſtorm, and abandoned to the ſoldiers, ſuffered for ſeven days all the diſtreſſes of cruelty and avarice No houſe eſcaped but that where Chevalier Bayard was lodged. At his entrance, the miſtreſs, a woman of figure, fell at his feet, and deeply ſobbing, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Oh! my Lord, ſave my life, ſave the honour of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters"</q> Take courage, Madam, ſaid the Chevalier, your life and their honour ſhall be ſecure while I have life. The two young ladies, brought from their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, were preſented to him; and the family, thus re-united, beſtowed their whole attention on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer. A dangerous wound he had received gave them opportunity to expreſs their zeal: they employed a notable ſurgeon; they attended him by turn day and night; and when he could bear to be amuſed, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him with concerts of muſic. Upon the day fixed for his departure, the mother ſaid to him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"To your goodneſs, my Lord, we owe our life, and to you all that we have belongs by right of war; but we hope from your ſignal benevolence, that this ſlight tribute will content you;"</q> placing upon the table an iron coffer full of money. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What is the ſum,"</q> ſaid the Chevalier. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"My Lord,"</q> anſwered ſhe trembling, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"no more but 2500 ducats, all that we have;—but if more be neceſſary, we will try our friends."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Madam,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I never ſhall forget your kindneſs, more precious in my eyes than an hundred thouſand ducats.

                     <p>The following incident is ſtill more intereſting: it is of a late date; it happened among our countrymen; and will, for theſe reaſons, make the deeper impreſſion. The ſcene of action was in Admiral Watſon's ſhip at the ſiege of Chandernagore, where Captain Speke, and his ſon, a youth of ſixteen, were both of them wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame ſhot. The hiſtory is related by Mr. Ives ſurgeon of the ſhip; which follows in his own words, only a little abridged. The Captain, whoſe leg was hanging by the ſkin, ſaid to the Admiral, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Sir, this was a cruel ſhot, to knock down both father and ſon."</q> Mr. Watſon's heart was too full for a reply; he only ordered both to be carried down to the ſurgeon. The Captain, who was firſt brought down, told me how dangerouſly his Billy had been wounded. Preſently after the brave youth himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, with his eyes overflowing with tears, not for himſelf but for his father. Upon my aſſurance that his father's wound was not dangerous, he became calm; but refuſed to be touched, till his father's wound ſhould be firſt dreſſed. Then pointing to a fellow s;ufferer, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Pray, Sir, dreſs alſo that poor man, who is groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſadly beſide me."</q> I told him that the man had already been taken care of; and begged, that I now might have liberty to examine his wound. He ſubmitted: and calmly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I fear you muſt amputate above the joint."</q> I replied, <q rend="inline">"My dear, I muſt."</q> He claſped his hands together; and, lifting his eyes towards heaven, he offered up the following ſhort but earneſt petition: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Good God! do thou on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to behave in my preſent circumſtances wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of my father."</q> He then told me he was all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. I performed the operation above the joint of the knee; and during the whole time the intrepid youth never ſpoke a word, nor uttered a groan that could be heard at the diſtance of a yard. It is eaſier to imagine than to expreſs the feelings of the father at this time: but whatever he felt, tears were the only expreſſion. Both of them were carried to Calcutta: the father was lodged in the houſe of his brother-in-law; and the ſon was placed with me in the hoſpital. For the firſt week I gave comfort to both, carrying good tidings to them of one another. But, alas! all the good ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that had attended the young man began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear. The Captain perceived all in my countenance; and ſo unwilling was he to add to my diſtreſs, as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſpeak about his ſon. One time he ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"How long, my friend, do you think my Billy may remain in a ſtate of uncertainty?"</q> I replied, that if he ſurvived the fifteenth day after the operation, there would be ſtrong hopes of his recovery. On the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth he died; and on the ſixteenth, the Captain, looking me ſtedfaſtly in the face, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Well, Ives, how fares it with my boy?"</q> Diſcovering the truth from my ſilence, he cried bitterly, ſqueezed my hand, and begged me to leave him for one half-hour. When I returned, he appeared, as he ever after did, perfectly calm and ſerene. The excellent youth had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious the evening before his death; and at two o'clock in the morning, he ſent me a note written with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of which the following is a copy. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Ives will conſider the diſorder a ſon muſt be in when he is dying, and is yet in doubt about his father.—If Mr. Ives is not too buſy to honour this note, which nothing but the greateſt uneaſineſs could draw from me—The boy waits an anſwer."</q> I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately repaired to him; and he had ſtill ſenſe enough to know me. He then ſaid, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"And is he dead?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Who, my dear?"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"My father, Sir."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"No, my love; nor is he in any danger; he is almoſt well,"</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I thank God: I am now ſatisfied, and am ready to die."</q> He had a locked jaw, and was in great pain, but I underſtood every word he uttered. He begged my pardon for having diſturbed me at ſo early an hour; and before the day was ended, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered a life that deſerved to he immortal.—So far my author; and I only add, Does peace afford any ſcene that can compare with this in moving our ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic feelings?</p>

Induſtry, manufactures, and wealth, are the fruits of peace; but advert to what follows. Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a never-failing concomitant of wealth, is a ſlow poiſon, that debilitates the mind, and renders it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any manly exertion; courage, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, heroiſm, come to be ranked among the miracles that are ſuppoſed never to have exiſted but in fable; and the faſhionable properties of ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, avarice, cunning, and diſſimulation, engroſs the mind. In a word, man by conſtant proſperity and peace degenerates into a mean, impotent, and ſelfiſh animal: more deſpicable, if leſs odious, than an American ſavage, who treaſures up the ſcalps of his enemies as trophies of his proweſs. Such are the fruits of perpetual peace with reſpect to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals.</p>
               <p>Nor is the ſtate itſelf leſs debilitated by itth an its members. Figure a man wallowing in riches, and immerſed in ſenſual pleaſure, but dreading the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection of a plague raging at his gate; or figure him in continual dread of an enemy, watching every opportunity to burn and deſtroy. This man repreſents a commercial ſtate, that has long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed peace, without diſturbance. A ſtate that is a tempting object to an invader, without means of defence, is in a woful ſituation. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of Venice was once famous for the wiſdom of its conſtitution, and for being the Chriſtian bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark againſt the Turks; but by long peace it has become altogether effeminate. Its preſent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of government are conformable to its character. Every cauſe of quarrel with a neighbour is anxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided; and diſturbances at home prevented by watchful ſpies. Holland, ſince the days of King William, has not produced a man fit to command a regiment: and the Dutch have nothing to rely on for independence, but mutual jealouſy among their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0032300302:230"/>
neighbours. Hannibal appeared upon the ſtage too early: had the Romans, after their conqueſt of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, been ſuffered to exchange their martial ſpirit for luxury and voluptuouſneſs, they would have been no match for that great general. It was equally lucky for the Romans, that they came late upon Macedon. Had Alexander finiſhed his conqueſt of Greece, and the Romans theirs of Italy, at the ſame period, they would probably have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined each of them within their own limits. But Aſiatic luxury and effeminacy, which had got hold of the Greeks and Macedonians before the Roman invaſion, rendered them an eaſy prey to the invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It was the conſtant cry of Cato the Cenſor, <q rend="inline">"Delenda eſt Carthago."</q> Scipio Naſica was a more able politician: his opinion was, to give peace to Carthage, that the dread of that once powerful republic might preſerve in vigour the military ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his country. What happened afterwards ſets the wiſdom of that advice in a conſpicuous light. The battle of Actium, after a long train of cruel civil wars, gave peace to Rome under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Auguſtus. Peace had not ſubſiſted much above thirty years, when a Roman army, under Quintilius Varus, was cut to pieces in Germany. The conſternation at Rome was great, as there was not a fortified town to prevent the Germans from pouring down upon Italy. Inſtant orders were given for levying men; but ſo effeminate had the Romans already become, that not a ſingle man would enliſt voluntarily. And Auguſtus was forced to uſe ſevere meaſures, before he could collect a very ſmall army. How different the military ſpirit of the Romans during the ſecond Punic war, when ſeveral Roman armies were cut off, greater than that of Varus. The citizens who could bear arms were reduced to 137,000; and yet in the later years of that war, the Romans made ſhift to keep

the field with no fewer than twenty-three legions<note n="a" place="bottom">Titus Livius, lib. 26. cap. 1.</note>. The Vandals, having expelled the Romans from Afric, enjoyed peace for a century without ſeeing the face of an enemy. Procopius<note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſtoria Vandalica, lib. 2.</note> gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account of them. Charmed with the fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoil and benignity of the climate, they abandoned themſelves to luxury, ſumptuous dreſs, high living, and frequent baths. They dwelt in the theatre and circus, amuſing themſelves with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, pantomimes, and other gay entertainments: their villas were ſplendid, and their gardens were adorned with water-works, beautiful trees, and odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous flowers: no regard to chaſtity, nor to any manly virtue. In that effeminate condition, they made ſcarce any reſiſtance to Beliſarius with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my far inferior to their own in number. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens of Aſia, corrupted by proſperity and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, were able to make no head againſt the Turks. About that time, the Spaniards, having by the ſame means become effeminate, were overpowered by the Saracens of Afric, who, remote from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners of Aſia, retained their military ſpirit. The wealth of the kingdom of Whida in Guinea, from fertility of ſoil, great induſtry, and extenſive commerce, produced luxury and effeminacy. The king, no leſs luxurious than his people, gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to ſenſual pleaſures, leaving government to his miniſters. In that ſituation was Whidah in the year 1727, when the king of Dahomay, an inland ſtate, requeſted acceſs to the ſea for trade, offering to purchaſe the privilege with a yearly tribute. A haughty denial furniſhed a pretext for war. The king of Dahomay invaded the territories of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with a diſciplined army, and pierced to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital without meeting any reſiſtance. The king of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0032300302:232"/>
Whidah with his women had fled to an iſland, and his people were all diſperſed. It amazed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, that a whole nation, without ſtriking a blow, had thus deſerted their wives, their children, their gods, their poſſeſſions, and all that was dear to them. The Japaneſe became warlike during long and bloody civil wars, which terminated, about the end of the ſixteenth century, in rendering their Emperor deſpotic. From that period no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has occurred for exerciſing their military ſpirit, except in the education of their youth: heroiſm, with contempt of death, are inculcated; and the hiſtories of their illuſtrious heroes are the only books that boys at ſchool are taught to read. But the profound tranquillity that the empire now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys in a ſtrict and regular government, will in time render that warlike people effeminate and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly: human nature cannot reſiſt the poiſon of perpetual peace and ſecurity. In the war between the Turks and Venetians, anno 1715, the latter put great confidence in Napoli di Romania, a city in the Morea ſtrongly fortified, and provided with every neceſſary for an obſtinate defence. They had not the leaſt doubt of being able to draw their whole force together, before the Turks could make any progreſs in the ſiege. But, to their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the taking of that city, and of every other fortified place in the Morea, was the work of but a ſingle campaign. So much had the Venetians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by long peace, from the courage and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm of their forefathers who conquered that country from the Turks. In ſome late accounts from China, we are told, that the King of Bengala or Bracma, having invaded Yunnan, an opulent province of China, obtained a complete victory over the Emperor's army, commanded by his ſon-in-law; which ſtruck the inhabitants of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince with ſuch a panic, that multitudes, for fear of

the conqueror, hanged and drowned themſelves. To what a torpid ſtate by this time would Europe have been reduced, had the plan for a perpetual peace, projected by Henry IV. of France, been carried into execution? Conqueſt, in a retrograde motion, would have directed its progreſs from the eaſt to the weſt. Our ſituation in an iſland, among ſeveral advantages, is ſo far unlucky, that it puts us off our guard, and renders us negligent in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for defence: we never were invaded without being ſubdued<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſituation of the King of Sardinia, environed on all ſides with powerful monarchs, obliges him to act with the greateſt circumſpection; which circumſtance ſeems to have formed the character of the princes of that houſe.

The fondneſs of the French for their ſovereign, and the eaſineſs and politeneſs of their manners, have corrupted a good conſtitution. The Britiſh conſtitution has been preſerved entire
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0032300302:235"/>
by a people jealous of their prince, and ſtubborn againſt every encroachment of regal power.</p>
               <p>There is another advantage of war, which ought not to be overlooked, though not capital. It ſerves to drain the country of idlers, few of whom are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and many not a little miſchievous. In the years 1759 and 1760, when we were at war with France, there were but twenty-nine criminals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at the Old Bailey. In the years 1770 and 1771, when we were at peace with all the world, the criminals condemned there amounted to one hundred and fifty-one.</p>
               <p>But though I declare againſt perpetual peace, perpetual war is ſtill more my averſion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Europe was deplorable in the dark ages, when vaſſals aſſumed the privilege of waging war without conſent of the ſovereign. Deadly feuds, which prevailed univerſally, threatened diſſolution of all government: the human race never were in a more woful condition. But anarchy never fails ſoon or late to provide a cure againſt itſelf, which effeminacy, produced by long peace, never does. Revenge and cruelty, it is true, are the fruits of war; but ſo are likewiſe firmneſs of mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage; which are exerted with better will in behalf of virtue than of revenge. The cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades were what firſt gave a turn to the fierce man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our anceſtors. A religious enterpriſe, which united numbers, formerly at variance, enlarged the ſphere of ſocial affection, and ſweetened the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Chriſtians to one another. Theſe cruſades filled Europe with heroes, who, at home, were ready for any new enterprize that promiſed laurels. Moved with the oppreſſive and miſerable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of deadly feuds, they joined in bonds of chivalry for ſuccouring the diſtreſſed, for redreſſing wrongs, and for protecting widows and orphans. Such heroiſm enflamed every one who was fond of glory and warlike atchievements. Chivalry was
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0032300302:236"/>
reliſhed by men of birth; and even kings were proud to be of the order. An inſtitution, blending together valour, religion, and gallantry, was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully agreeable to a martial people, and tended ſtrongly to improve their manners: humanity and gentleneſs could not but prevail in a ſociety, whoſe profeſſion it was, to ſuccour every perſon in diſtreſs. And as glory and honour were the only wiſhed-for recompence, chivalry was eſteemed the ſchool of honour, of truth, and of fidelity. Thus, truth without diſguiſe, and a ſcrupulous adherence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, became the diſtinguiſhing virtues of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. It is true, that the enthuſiaſm of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing widows and orphans, degenerated ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extravagance; witneſs knights who wandered about in queſt of adventures. But it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to condemn the whole order, becauſe a few of their number were fooliſh. The true ſpirit of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry produced undoubtedly a ſignal reformation in the manners of Europe. To what other cauſe can we ſo juſtly aſcribe the point of honour, and that humanity in war, which characterize modern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners<note n="c" place="bottom">Dr. Robertſon's hiſtory of the Emperor Charles V.</note>? Are peace, luxury, and ſelfiſhneſs, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing ſuch effects?</p>
               <p>That man ſhould be the only animal who makes war upon his own kind may at firſt appear ſtrange and unaccountable.

               <head>Riſe and Fall of PATRIOTISM.</head>
               <p>THE members of a tribe, in their original ſtate of hunting and fiſhing, being little united but by a common language, have no notion of a patria; and ſcarce any notion of ſociety, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when they join in an expedition againſt an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or againſt wild beaſts. The ſhepherd-ſtate, where flocks and herds are poſſeſſed in common, gives a clear notion of a common intereſt; but ſtill none of a patria. The ſenſe of a patria begins to unfold itſelf, when a people leave off wandering, to ſettle upon a territory which they call their own. Agriculture connects them together; and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill more: they become fellow-citizens; and the territory is termed the patria of every perſon born in it. It is ſo ordered by Providence, that a man's country, and his countrymen, are to him in conjunction an object of a peculiar affection, term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amor patriae, or patriotiſm; an affection that riſes high among a people intimately connected by regular government, by huſbandry, by commerce, and by a common intereſt. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Cari ſunt parentes, cari liberi, propinqui, familiares; ſed omnes omnium caritates patria una complexa eſt: pro qua quis bonus dubitet mortem oppetere<note n="*" place="bottom">

Social paſſions and affections, beſide being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more agreeable than ſelfiſh, are thoſe only which command our eſteem<note n="d" place="bottom">Elements of Criticiſm, vol. 1. p. 113. edit. 5.</note>. Patriotiſm ſtands at the head of ſocial affections; and ſtands ſo high in our eſteem, that no actions but what proceed from it are termed grand or heroic. When that affection appears ſo agreeable in contemplation, how ſweet, how elevating, muſt it be in thoſe whom it inſpires! Like vigorous health, it beats conſtantly with an equal pulſe: like the veſtal fire, it never is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. No ſource of enjoyment is more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than patriotiſm, where it is the ruling paſſion: it triumphs over every ſelfiſh motive, and is a firm ſupport to every virtue. In fact, wherever it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the morals of the people are found to be pure and correct.</p>
               <p>Theſe are illuſtrious effects of patriotiſm with reſpect to private happineſs and virtue; and yet its effects with reſpect to the public are ſtill more illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious. A nation in no other period of its progreſs is ſo flouriſhing, as when patriotiſm is the ruling paſſion of every member: during that period, it is invincible. Atheneus remarks, that the Athenians were the only people in the world, who, though clothed in purple, put formidable armies to flight at Marathon, Salamine, and Platea. But at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod patriotiſm was their ruling paſſion; and ſucceſs attended them in every undertaking. Where pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm rules, men do wonders, whatever garb they wear. The fall of Saguntum is a grand ſcene; a people exerting the utmoſt powers of nature, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their country. The city was indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; but the citizens were not ſubdued. The laſt effort of the remaining heroes was, to burn themſelves, with their wives and children, in one great funeral pile. Numantia affords a ſcene not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0032300302:241"/>
leſs grand. The citizens, ſuch as were able to bear arms, did not exceed 8000; and yet braved all the efforts of 60,000 diſciplined ſoldiers commanded by Scipio Naſica. So high was their character for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity, that even when but a few of them were left alive, the Romans durſt not attempt to ſtorm the town. And they ſtood firm till, ſubdued by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, they were no longer able to crawl. While the Portugueſe were eminent for patriotiſm, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez Caraico, one of their ſea-captains, in a ſingle ſhip with but forty men, ſtumbled upon the King of Achin's fleet of twenty gallies, as many junks, and a multitude of ſmall veſſels. Reſolute to periſh rather than yield, he maintained the fight for three days, till his ſhip was pierced through and through with cannon-ſhot, and not a ſingle man left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded. And yet, after all, the King's fleet found it convenient to ſheer off.</p>
               <p>Patriotiſm at the ſame time is the great bulwark of civil liberty; equally abhorrent of deſpotiſm on the one hand, and of licentiouſneſs on the other. While the deſpotic government of the Tudor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſubſiſted, the Engliſh were too much depreſſed to have any affection for their country. But when manufactures and commerce began to flouriſh in the latter end of Elizabeth's reign, a national ſpirit broke forth, and patriotiſm made ſome figure. That change of diſpoſition was perhaps the chief cauſe, though not the moſt viſible, of the national ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles for liberty, which were frequent during the government of the Stewart family, and which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a free government at the Revolution.</p>
               <p>Patriotiſm is too much cramped in a very ſmall ſtate, and too much relaxed in an extenſive monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. But that topic has already been diſcuſſed in the firſt ſketch of this book.</p>
               <p>Patriotiſm is enflamed by a ſtruggle for liberty, by a civil war, by reſiſting a potent invader, or by
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0032300302:242"/>
any incident that forcibly draws the members of a ſtate into ſtrict union for the common intereſt. The reſolute oppoſition of the ſeven provinces to Philip II. of Spain, in the cauſe of liberty, is an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtance of the patriotic ſpirit riſing to a degree of enthuſiaſm. Patriotiſm, rouſed among the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicans by the oppreſſion of the Genoeſe, exerted it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon every proper object. Even during the heat of the war, they erected an univerſity for arts and ſciences, a national bank, and a national libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; improvements that would not have been thought of in their torpid ſtate. Alas! they have fallen a victim to thirſt of power, not to ſuperior valour. Had Providence favoured them with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, their figure would have been conſiderable in peace as in war<note n="*" place="bottom">The elevation of ſentiment that a ſtruggle for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty inſpires, is conſpicuous in the following incident. A Corſican being condemned to die for an atrocious crime, his nephew with deep concern addreſſed Paoli in the following terms. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, if you pardon my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, his relations will give to the ſtate a thouſand ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins, beſide furniſhing fifty ſoldiers during the ſiege of Furiali.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>But violent commotions cannot be perpetual: one party prevails, and proſperity follows. What effect may this have on patriotiſm? I anſwer, that nothing is more animating than ſucceſs after a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtruggle: a nation in that ſtate reſembles a comet, which in paſſing near the ſun, has been
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0032300302:243"/>
much heated, and continues full of motion. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm made a capital figure among the Athenians, when they became a free people, after expelling the tyrant Piſiſtratus. Every man exerted himſelf for his country: every man endeavoured to excell thoſe who went before him: and hence a Miltiades, an Ariſtides, a Themiſtocles, names that for ever will figure in the annals of time. While the Roman republic was confined within narrow bounds, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of manners, and diſintereſted love to their country, formed the national character. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Patricians above the Plebeians, a ſource of endleſs diſcord, was at laſt remedied by placing all the citizens upon a level. This ſignal revolution excited an animating emulation between the Patricians and Plebeians; the former, by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic actions, labouring to maintain their ſuperiority; the latter ſtraining every nerve to equal them: the republic never at any other period produced ſo great men in the art of war.</p>
               <p>But ſuch variety there is human affairs, that tho' men are indebted to emulation for their heroic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet actions of that kind never fail to ſuppreſs emulation in thoſe who follow. An obſervation is made above<note n="e" place="bottom">Book 1. Sketch 5. § 1.</note>, that nothing is more fatal to the progreſs of an art, than a perſon of ſuperior genius, who damps emulation in others: witneſs the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Newton, to whom the decay of mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge in Britain is juſtly attributed. The obſervation holds equally with reſpect to action. Thoſe actions only that flow from patriotiſm are deemed grand and heroic; and ſuch actions, above all others, rouſe a national ſpirit. But beware of a Newton in heroiſm: inſtead of exciting emulation, he will damp it: deſpair to equal the great men who are the admiration of all men, puts an end to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0032300302:244"/>
After the illuſtrious atchievements of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades, and after the eminent patriotiſm of Ariſtides, we hear no more in Greece of emulation or of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm. Pericles was a man of parts, but he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed Athens to his ambition. The Athenians ſunk lower and lower under the Archons, who had neither parts nor patriotiſm; and were reduced at laſt to ſlavery, firſt by the Macedonians, and next by the Romans. The Romans run the ſame courſe, from the higheſt exertions of patriotic emulation, down to the moſt abject ſelfiſhneſs and effeminacy.</p>
               <p>And this leads to other cauſes that extinguiſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, or relax it. Factious diſorders in a ſtate never fail to relax it; for there the citizen is loſt, and every perſon is beheld in the narrow view of a friend or an enemy. In the conteſts between the Patricians and Plebeians of Rome, the public was totally diſregarded: the Plebeians could have no heart-affection for a country where they were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and the Patricians might be fond of their own order, but they could not ſincerely love their country, while they were enemies to the bulk of their countrymen. Patriotiſm did not ſhine forth in Rome, till all equally became citizens.</p>
               <p>To ſupport patriotiſm, it is neceſſary that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be in a train of proſperity: when a nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſtationary, patriotiſm ſubſides. The ancient Romans upon a ſmall foundation erected a great empire; ſo great indeed, that it fell to pieces by its unwieldineſs. But the plurality of nations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their ſituation, from the temper of their people, or from the nature of their government, are confined within narrower limits; beyond which their utmoſt exertions avail little, unleſs they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be extraordinary favourites of fortune. When a nation becomes thus ſtationary, its puſhing genius is at an end: its plan is to preſerve, not to acquire: the members, even without any example of heroiſm
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0032300302:245"/>
to damp emulation, are infected with the languid tone of the ſtate: patriotiſm ſubſides; and we hear no more of bold or heroic actions. The Venetians are a pregnant inſtance of the obſervation. Their trade with Aleppo and Alexandria did for centuries introduce into Europe the commodities of Syria, Egypt, Arabia, Perſia, and India. The cities of Nuremberg and Augſburgh in particular, were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied from Venice with theſe commodities; and by that traffick became populous and opulent. Venice, in a word, was for centuries the capital trading town of Europe, and powerful above all its neighbours, both at ſea and land. A paſſage to the Eaſt Indies by the Cape of Good Hope was indeed an animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovery to the Portugueſe; but it did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to exclude the Venetians. The greater diſtance of Venice from the Cape, a trifle in itſelf, is more than balanced by its proximity to Greece, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and to the reſt of Italy. But the Portugueſe at that period were in the ſpring of proſperity; and patriotiſm envigorated them to make durable eſtabliſhments on the Indian coaſt, overpowering every nation that ſtood in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The Venetians, on the contrary, being a nation of merchants, and having been long ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in commerce, were become ſtationary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for bold adventures. Being cut out of their wonted commerce to India, and not having reſolution to carry on commerce in a new channel, they ſunk under the good fortune of their rivals, and abandoned the trade altogether.</p>
               <p>No cauſe hitherto mentioned hath ſuch influence in depreſſing patriotiſm, as inequality of rank and of riches in an opulent monarchy. A continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of wealth into the capital, generates ſhow, luxury, avarice, which are all ſelfiſh vices; and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, enſlaving the mind, eradicates every fibre
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0032300302:246"/>
of patriotiſm<note n="*" place="bottom">France is not an exception. The French are vain of their country, becauſe they are vain of themſelves. But ſuch vanity muſt be diſtinguiſhed from patriotiſm, which conſiſts in loving our country independent of ourſelves.</note>. Aſiatic luxury, flowing into Rome in a plentiful ſtream, produced an univerſal corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, and metamorphoſed into volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs the warlike genius of that great city. The dominions of Rome were now too extenſive for a republican government, and its generals too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be diſintereſted. Paſſion for glory wore out of faſhion, as auſterity of manners had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: power and riches were now the only objects of ambition: virtue ſeemed a farce; honour, a chimera; and fame, mere vanity: every Roman, abandoning himſelf to ſenſuality, flattered himſelf, that he, more wiſe than his forefathers, was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the cunning road to happineſs. Corruption and venality became general, and maintained their uſurpation in the provinces as well as in the capital, without ever loſing a foot of ground. Pyrrhus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by preſents to corrupt the Roman ſenators, but made not the ſlighteſt impreſſion. Deplorable was the change of manners in the days of Jugurtha:—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Pity it is,</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that no man is ſo opulent as to purchaſe a people ſo willing to be ſold."</q> Cicero, mentioning an oracle of Apollo, that Sparta would never be deſtroyed but by avarice, juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the prediction holds in every nation as well as in Sparta. The Greek empire, ſunk in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs without a remaining ſpark of patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, was no match for the Turks, enflamed with a new religion, that promiſed paradiſe to thoſe who ſhould die fighting for their prophet. How many nations, like thoſe mentioned, illuſtrious formerly for vigour of mind, and love to their country, are
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0032300302:247"/>
now ſunk by contemptible vices as much below brutes as they ought to be elevated above them: brutes ſeldom deviate from the perfection of their nature, men frequently.</p>
               <p>Succeſsful commerce is not more advantageous by the wealth and power it immediately beſtows, than it is hurtful ultimately by introducing luxury and voluptuouſneſs, which eradicate patriotiſm. In the capital of a great monarchy, the poiſon of opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is ſudden; becauſe opulence there is ſeldom acquired by reputable means: the poiſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial opulence is ſlow, becauſe commerce ſeldom enriches without induſtry, ſagacity, and fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But by whatever means acquired, opulence never fails ſoon or late to ſmother patriotiſm under ſenſuality and ſelfiſhneſs. We learn from Plutarch and other writers, that the Athenians, who had long enjoyed the ſunſhine of commerce, were extremely corrupt in the days of Philip, and of his ſon Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander. Even their chief patriot and orator, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed champion for independence, was not proof againſt bribes. While Alexander was proſecuting his conqueſts in India, Harpalus, to whom his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe treaſure was intruſted, fled with the whole to Athens. Demoſthenes adviſed his fellow-citizens to expell him, that they might not incur Alexander's diſpleaſure. Among other things of value, there was the King's cup of maſſy gold, curiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved. Demoſthenes, ſurveying it with a greedy eye, aſked Harpalus what it weighed. To you, ſaid Harpalus ſmiling, it ſhall weigh twenty talents; and that every night he ſent privately to Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes twenty talents with the cup. Demoſthenes next day came into the aſſembly with a cloth rolled about his neck; and his opinion being demanded about Harpalus, he made ſigns that he had loſt his voice. The Capuans, the Tarentines, and other Greek colonies in the lower parts of Italy, when
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0032300302:248"/>
invaded by the Romans, were no leſs degenerate than their brethren in Greece when invaded by Philip of Macedon; the ſame depravation of manners, the ſame luxury, the ſame paſſion for feaſts and ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, the ſame inteſtine ſactions, the ſame indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about their country, and the ſame contempt of its laws. The Portugueſe, enflamed with love to their country, when they diſcovered a paſſage to the Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, made great and important ſettlements in that very diſtant part of the globe; and of their immenſe commerce there is no parallel in any age or country. Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious riches in gold, precious ſtones, ſpices, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, drugs, and manufactures, were annually imported into Liſbon from their ſettlements on the coaſts of Malabar and Coromandel, from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Camboya, Decan, Malacca, Patana, Siam, China, &amp;c. from the iſlands of Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Moluccas, and Japan: and to Liſbon all the nations in Europe reſorted for theſe valuable commodities. But the downfall of the Portugueſe was no leſs rapid than their exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unbounded power and immenſe wealth hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced a total corruption of manners. If ſincere piety, exalted courage, and indefatigable induſtry, made the original adventurers more than men; indolence, ſenſuality, and effeminacy, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their ſucceſſors leſs than women. Unhappy it was for them to be attacked at that critical time by the Dutch, who, in defence of liberty againſt the tyranny of Spain, were enflamed with love to their country, as the Portugueſe had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note n="*" place="bottom">While patriotiſm was the ruling paſſion of the Portugueſe, their illuſtrious general Don Alphonſo d'Albuquerque carried all before him in the Indies. He adhered to the ancient frugality of his countrymen, and notwithſtanding his great power and wealth, remained uncorrupted. Tho' liberal in praiſing his officers, he never preferred any who attempted to gain his favour by flattery. In private life he was of the ſtricteſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but as juſtice is little regarded between nations, it was no obſtruction to his ambitious views of extending the dominions of Portugal.</note>. The Dutch, originally from their ſituation a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0032300302:249"/>
temperate and induſtrious people, became heroes in the cauſe of liberty as juſt now mentioned; and patriotiſm was their ruling paſſion. Proſperous commerce ſpread wealth through every corner; and yet ſuch was the inherent virtue of that people, that their patriotiſm reſiſted very long the contagion of wealth. But as appetite for riches increaſes with their quantity, patriotiſm ſunk in proportion, till it was totally extinguiſhed; and now the Dutch never think of their country, unleſs as ſubſervient to private intereſt. With reſpect to the Dutch Eaſt-India company in particular, it was indebted for its proſperity to the fidelity and ſrugality of its ſervants, and to the patriotiſm of all. But theſe virtues were undermined, and at laſt eradicated, by luxury, which Europeans ſeldom reſiſt in a hot climate. People go from Europe in the ſervice of the company, bent beforehand to make their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune per fas aut nefas; and their diſtance from their maſters renders every check abortive. The company, eat up by their ſervants, is rendered ſo feeble, as to be incapable of maintaining their ground againſt any extraordinary ſhock. A war of any continuance with the Indian potentates, or with the Engliſh company, would reduce them to bankruptcy. They are at preſent as ripe for being ſwallowed up by any rival power, as the Portugueſe were formerly for being ſwallowed up by them. Quaeritur, Is the Engliſh Eaſt-India company in a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0032300302:250"/>
much better condition? Such is the riſe and fall of patriotiſm among the nations mentioned; and ſuch will be its riſe and fall among all nations in like circumſtances.</p>
               <p>It grieves me, that the epidemic diſtempers of luxury and ſelfiſhneſs are ſpreading wide in Britain. It is fruitleſs to diſſemble, that profligate manners muſt in Britain be a conſequence of too great opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as they have been in every other part of the globe. Our late diſtractions leave no room for a doubt. Liſten to a man of figure, thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every machination for court-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Very little attachment is diſcoverable in the body of our people to our excellent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: no reverence for the cuſtoms nor for the opinions of our anceſtors; no attachment but to private intereſt, nor any zeal but for ſelfiſh gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. While party-diſtinctions of Whig and Tory, high church and low church, court and country, ſubſiſted, the nation was indeed divided, but each ſide held an opinion, for which he would have hazarded every thing; for both acted from principle: if there were ſome who ſought to alter the conſtitution, there were many who would have ſpilt their blood to preſerve it from violation: if divine hereditary right had its partiſans, there were multitudes to ſtand up for the ſuperior ſanctity of a title founded on an act of parliament, and the conſent of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But the abolition of party-names have deſtroyed all public principles. The power of the crown was indeed never more viſibly exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive over the great men of the nation; but then theſe men have loſt their influence over the lower orders: even parliament has loſt much of its authority; and the voice of the multitude is ſct up againſt the ſenſe of the legiſlature: an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed and heavily-burdened public, a people
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0032300302:251"/>
luxurious and licentious, impatient of rule, and deſpiſing all authority, government relaxed in every ſinew, and a corrupt ſelfiſh ſpirit pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole<note n="f" place="bottom">The Honourable George Greenville.</note>."</q> It is a common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when the belly is full, the mind is at eaſe. That obſervation, it would appear, holds not in London; for never in any other place did riot and licentiouſneſs riſe to ſuch a height, without a cauſe, and without even a plauſible pretext<note n="*" place="bottom">This was compoſed in the year 1770.</note>.</p>
               <p>It is deplorable, that in Engliſh public ſchools, patriotiſm makes no branch of education; young men, on the contrary, are trained up to ſelfiſhneſs. Keep what you get, and get what you can, is the chief leſſon inculcated at Weſtminſter, Wincheſter, and Eaton. Students put themſelves in the way of receiving vails from ſtrangers; and that dirty prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice continues, tho' far more poiſonous to manners, than the giving vails to menial ſervants, which the nation is now aſhamed of. The Eaton ſcholars are at times ſent to the highway to rob paſſengers. The ſtrong without control tyrannize over the weak, ſubjecting them to every ſervile office, wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhoes not excepted. They are permitted to trick and deceive one another; and the fineſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is he who is the moſt artful. Friendſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is cultivated, but ſuch as we find among rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: a boy would be run down, if he had no aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate. In a word, the moſt determined ſelfiſhneſs is the capital leſſon.</p>
               <p>When a nation, formerly warlike and public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited, is depreſſed by luxury and ſelfiſhneſs, doth nature afford no means for reſtoring it to its former ſtate? The Emperor Hadrian declared the Greeks a free people; not doubting, but that a change ſo animating, would reſtore the fine arts to their priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0032300302:252"/>
luſtre.—A vain attempt: for the genius of the Greeks vaniſhed with their patriotiſm; and liberty to them was no bleſſing. With reſpect to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, the decay of their power and of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, have reduced them to a much lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, than when they roſe as it were out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing At that time they were poor, but innocent: at preſent they are poor, but corrupted with many vices. Their pride in particular ſwells as high as when maſters of the Indies. The following ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inſtance is a pregnant proof: ſhoes and ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are prohibited to their Indian ſubjects; tho' many of them would pay handſomely for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. There is one obvious meaſure for reviving the Portugueſe trade in India; but they have not ſo much vigour of mind remaining, as even to think of execution. They ſtill poſſeſs in that country, the town and territory of Goa, the town and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of Diu, with ſome other ports, all admirably ſituated for trade. What ſtands in the way but indolence merely, againſt declaring the places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned free ports, with liberty of conſcience to traders of whatever religion? Free traders flocking there, under protection of the Portugueſe, would undermine the Dutch and Engliſh companies, which cannot trade upon an equal footing with private merchants; and by that means, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe trade might again flouriſh. But that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not yet brought ſo low as to be compelled to change their manners, tho' reduced to depend on their neighbours even for common neceſſaries. The gold and diamonds of Braſil are a plague that corrupt all. Spain and Portugal afford inſtructive political leſſons: the latter has been ruined by opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; the former, as will be ſeen afterward, by taxes no leſs impolitic than oppreſſive. To enable theſe nations to recommence their former courſe, or any nation in the ſame ſituation, I can diſcover
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0032300302:253"/>
no means but pinching poverty. Commerce and manufactures taking wing, may leave a country in a very diſtreſſed condition: but a people may be very diſtreſſed, and yet very vitious; for vices ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by opulence are not ſoon eradicated. And tho' other vices ſhould at laſt vaniſh with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that promoted them, indolence and puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity will remain for ever, unleſs by ſome power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cauſe the oppoſite virtues be introduced. A very poor man, however indolent, will be tempted for bread to exert ſome activity; and he may be trained gradually from leſs to more by the ſame means. Activity at the ſame time produces bodily ſtrength; which will reſtore courage and boldneſs. By ſuch means a nation may be put in motion with the ſame advantages it had originally; and its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond progreſs may prove as ſucceſsful as the firſt. Thus nations go round in a circle, from weakneſs to ſtrength, and from ſtrength to weakneſs. The firſt part of the progreſs is verified in a thouſand inſtances; but the world has not ſubſiſted long enough to afford any clear inſtance of the other.</p>
               <p>I cloſe this ſketch with two illuſtrious examples of patriotiſm; one ancient, one modern; one among the whites, and one among the blacks. Ariſtides the Athenian is famed above all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients for love to his country. Its ſafety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were the only objects of his ambition; and his ſignal diſintereſtedneſs made it the ſame to him, whether theſe ends were accompliſhed by himſelf or by others, by his friends or his foes. One con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous inſtance occurred before the battle of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon. Of the ten generals choſen to command the Athenian army, he was one: but ſenſible that a divided command is ſubjected to manifold incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, he exerted all his influence for delegat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole power to Miltiades; and at the ſame time zealouſly ſupported the propoſal of Miltiades,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0032300302:254"/>
of boldly meeting the Perſians in the field. His diſintereſtedneſs was ſtill more conſpicuous with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Themiſtocles, his bitter enemy. Suſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all enmity, he cordially agreed with him in every operation of the war; aſſiſting him with his counſel and credit, and yet ſuffering him to engroſs all the honours of victory. In peace he was the ſame, yielding to Themiſtocles in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government, and contenting himſelf with a ſubordinate place. In the ſenate and in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the people, he made many propoſals in a borrowed name, to prevent envy and oppoſition. He retired from public buſineſs in the latter part of his life; paſſing his time in training young men for ſerving the ſtate, inſtilling into them principles of honour and virtue, and inſpiring them with love to their country. His death unſolded a ſignal proof of the contempt he had for riches; he who had been treaſurer of Greece during the laviſhment of war, left not ſufficient to defray the expence of his funeral: a Britiſh commiſſary in like circumſtances acquires the riches of Croeſus.</p>
               <p>The ſcene of the other example is Fouli, a negro kingdom in Africa. Such regard is paid there to royal blood, that no man can ſucceed to the crown, but who is connected with the firſt monarch, by an uninterrupted chain of females: a connection by males would give no ſecurity, as the women of that country are prone to gallantry. In the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the Prince of Sambaboa, the King's nephew by his ſiſter, was inveſted with the dignity of Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malingo, a dignity appropriated to the preſumptive heir. A liberal and generous mind, with undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage, rivetted him in the affections of the nobility and people. They rejoiced in the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of having him for their King. But their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was blaſted. The King, fond of his children, ventured a bold meaſure, which was, to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0032300302:255"/>
inveſt his eldeſt ſon with the dignity of Kamalingo, and to declare him heir to the crown. Tho' the Prince of Sambaboa had for him the laws of the kingdom, and the hearts of the people, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in ſilence to avoid a civil war. He could not however prevent men of rank from flocking to him; which the King interpreting to be a rebellion, raiſed an army in order to put them all to the ſword. As the King advanced, the Prince retired, reſolving not to draw his ſword againſt an uncle, whom he was accuſtomed to call father. But finding that the command of the King's army was beſtowed on his rival, he made ready for battle. The Prince obtained a complete victory: but his heart was not elated: the horrors of a civil war ſtared him in the face: he bid farewell to his friends, diſmiſſed his army, and retired into a neighbouring kingdom; relying on the affections of the people to be placed on the throne after his uncle's death. During baniſhment, which continued thirty tedious years, frequent attempts upon his life put his temper to a ſevere trial; for while he exiſted, the King had no hopes that his ſon would reign in peace. He had the fortitude to ſtand every trial; when, in the year 1702, beginning to yield to age and misfortunes, his uncle died. His couſin was depoſed; and he was called by the unanimous voice of the nobles, to reign over a people who adored him.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IN the following ſlight eſſay, intended for novices only, it is my ſole ambition to rival certain pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking authors, who teach hiſtory in the perſpicuous mode of queſtion and anſwer. Among novices, it would be unpardonable to rank ſuch of my fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as are ambitious of a ſeat in parliament; many of whom ſacrifice the inheritance of their anceſtors, for an opportunity to exert their patriotiſm in that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt aſſembly. Can ſuch a ſacrifice permit me to doubt, of their being adepts in the myſteries of government, and of taxes in particular? they ought at leaſt to be initiated in theſe myſteries.</p>
                  <p>It is of importance, that taxes, and their effects, be underſtood, not only by the members of our parliament, but alſo by their electors: a repreſentative will not readily vote for a deſtructive tax, when he cannot hope to diſguiſe his conduct. The intention of the preſent ſketch, is to unfold the principles upon which taxes ought to be founded, and to point out what are benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, what noxious. I have endeavoured to introduce ſome light into a ſubject involved in Egyptian darkneſs; and if that end be attained, I ſhall die in the faith, that I have not been an unprofitable ſervant to my country.</p>

                  <head>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS on TAXES.</head>
                  <p>AS opulence is not friendly to ſtudy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the men beſt qualified for being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, admirals, judges, or miniſters of ſtate, are ſeldom opulent; and to make ſuch men ſerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pay, would be in effect to eaſe the rich at the expence of the poor. With reſpect to the military branch in particular, the bulk of thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an army, if withdrawn from daily labour, muſt ſtarve, unleſs the public, which they ſerve, afford them maintenance. A republican government, during peace, may indeed be ſupported at a very ſmall charge among a temperate and patriotic peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. In a monarchy, a public fund is indiſpenſable, even during peace: and in war it is indiſpenſable, whatever be the government. The Spartans car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all before them in Greece, but were forced to quit their hold, having no fund for a ſtanding army; and the other Greek ſtates were obliged to confederate with the Athenians, who after the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0032300302:258"/>
war became maſters at ſea. A defect ſo obvious in the Spartan government did aſſuredly not eſcape Lycurgus, the moſt profound of all legiſlators. Foreſeeing that conqueſt would be deſtructive to his countrymen, his ſole purpoſe was to guard them from being conquered; which in Sparta required no public fund, as all the citizens were equal, and equally bound to defend themſelves and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A ſtate, it is true, without a public fund, is ill qualified to oppoſe a ſtanding army, regularly diſciplined, and regularly paid. But in political matters, experience is our only ſure guide; and the hiſtory of nations, at that early period, was too barren to afford inſtruction. Lycurgus may well be excuſed, conſidering how little progreſs political knowledge had made in a much later period. Charles VII. of France was the firſt in modern times who eſtabliſhed a fund for a ſtanding army. Againſt that dangerous innovation, the crown-vaſſals had no reſource but to imitate their ſovereign; and yet, without even dreaming of a reſource, they ſuffered themſelves to be undermined, and at laſt overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the King their ſuperior. Thus, on the one hand, a nation, however warlike, that has not a public fund, is no match for a ſtanding army enured to war. Extenſive commerce, on the other hand, enables a nation to ſupport a ſtanding army; but, by introducing luxury, it eradicates manhood, and renders that army an unfit match for any poor and warlike invader. Hard may ſeem the fate of nations, laid thus open to deſtruction from every quarter. All that can be ſaid is, that the Deity never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſtamp immortality upon any production of man.</p>
                  <p>The ſtability of land fits it, above all other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for a public patrimony. But as crown-lands lie open to the rapacity of favourites, it becomes neceſſary, when theſe are diſſipated, to introduce
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0032300302:259"/>
taxes; which have the following properties; that they unite in one common intereſt the ſovereign and his ſubjects, and that they can be augmented or diminiſhed according to exigencies.</p>
                  <p>The art of levying money by taxes was ſo little underſtood in the ſixteenth century, that after the famous battle of Pavia, in which the French King was made priſoner, Charles V. was obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his victorious army, tho' conſiſting but of 24,000 men, becauſe he had not the art to levy, in his extenſive dominions, the ſum that was neceſſary to keep it on foot. So little knowledge was there in England of political arithmetic in the days of Edward III. that L. 1: 2: 4 on each pariſh was computed to be ſufficient for raiſing a ſubſidy of L. 50,000. It being found, that there were but 8700 pariſhes, excluſive of Wales, the parliament, in order to raiſe the ſaid ſubſidy, aſſeſſed on each pariſh L. 5, 16s.</p>
                  <p>In impoſing taxes, ought not the expence of living to be deducted, leaving the remainder of a man's ſtock as the only taxable ſubject? This method was adopted in the ſtate of Athens. A rent of 500 meaſures of corn, burdened the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord with the yearly contribution of a talent: a rent of 300, burdened him with half a talent: a rent of 200, burdened him with the ſixth part of a talent; and land under that rent paid no tax. Here the tax was not in proportion to the eſtate, but to what could be ſpared out of it; or, in other words, in proportion to the ability of the proprietor. At the ſame time, ability muſt not be eſtimated by what a man actually ſaves, which would exempt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and profligate from paying taxes, but by what a man can pay who lives with oeconomy according to his rank. This rule is founded on the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of government: to tax a man's food, or the ſubject that affords him bare neceſſaries, is worſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0032300302:260"/>
than the denying him protection: it ſtarves him. Hence the following propoſition may be laid down as the corner-ſtone for taxation-buildiding, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That every man ought to contribute to the public revenue, not in proportion to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,"</q> but to his ability. I am ſorry to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that this rule is little regarded in Britiſh taxes; though nothing would contribute more to ſweeten the minds of the people, and to make them fond of their government, than a regulation fraught with ſo much equity.</p>
                  <p>Taxes were long in uſe before it was diſcovered that they could be made ſubſervient to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes beſide that of ſupporting government. In the fifteenth century, the ſtates of Burgundy rejected with indignation a demand made by the Duke of a duty on ſalt, though they found no other objection, but that it would oppreſs the poor people, who lived moſtly on ſalt meat and ſalt fiſh. It did not occur to them, that ſuch a tax might hurt their manufactures, by raiſing the price of labour. A tax of two ſhillings on every hearth, known by the name of hearth-money, was granted to Charles II. his heirs and ſucceſſors for ever. It was abrogated by an act of William and Mary, ann. 1688, on the following preamble. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That it is not only a great oppreſſion upon the poorer ſort, but a badge of ſlavery upon the whole people, expoſing every man's houſe to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d ſearched at pleaſure by perſons unknown to him."</q> Had the harm done by ſuch a tax to our manufactures been at that time underſtood, it would have been urged as the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reaſon againſt the tax. Our late improvements in commercial pol tics have unfolded an important doctrine, That taxes are ſeldom indifferent to the public good; that frequently they are more oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0032300302:261"/>
to people, than beneficial to the ſovereign; and, on the other hand, that they may be ſo contrived, as to rival bounties in promoting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, manufactures, and commerce. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects of taxes have rendered the ſubject not a little intricate.</p>
                  <p>It is an article of importance in government, to have it aſcertained, what proportion of the annual income of a nation may be drawn from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by taxes, without impoveriſhing them. An eighth part is held to be too much: huſbandry, commerce, and population would ſuffer. Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſays, that the Dutch pay to the public an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the fourth part of the income of their country; and he adds, that their ſtrict oeconomy enables them to bear that immenſe load, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raiſing the price of labour ſo high as to cut them out of the foreign market. It was probably ſo in the days of Davenant; but of late matters are much altered: the dearneſs of living and of labour has excluded all the Dutch manufactures from the foreign market. Till the French war in King William's reign, England paid in taxes but about a twentieth part of its annual income.</p>

                  <p>THAT to impoſe taxes belongs to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and to him only, is undoubted. But it has been doubted, whether even king and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who poſſeſs the ſovereign authority in Britain, can legally impoſe a tax without conſent of the people. The celebrated Locke, in his Eſſay on Government<note n="a" place="bottom">Chap. 11. § 140.</note>, lays down the following propoſition as fundamental. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"'Tis true, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be ſupported without great charge, and 'tis fit every one who enjoys his ſhare of protection ſhould pay out of his eſtate his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for the maintenance of it. But ſtill it muſt be with his own conſent, i.e. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the majority, giving it, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their repreſentatives choſen by them; for if any one ſhall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people by his own authority, and without ſuch conſent of the people, he thereby invades the fundamental law of property, and ſubverts the end of government. For what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty have I in that which another may by right take, when he pleaſes, to himſelf?"</q> No author has reflected more honour on his native country, and on mankind, than Mr. Locke. Yet no name is above truth; and I am obliged to obſerve, though with regret, that, in the foregoing reaſoning, the right of impoſing taxes is laid upon a very crazy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0032300302:263"/>
foundation. It may indeed be ſaid, with ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that the freeholder, virtually impower their repreſentatives to tax them. But their vaſſals and tenants, who have no vote in electing members of parliament, empower none to tax them: yet they are taxed like others; and ſo are the vaſſals and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of peers. Add to theſe, an immenſe number of artiſans, manufacturers, day-labourers, domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, &amp;c. &amp;c. with the whole female ſex; and it will appear, on calculation, that thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in parliament make not the hundredth part of the taxable people. But further, it is acknowledged by our author, that the majority of the Lords and Commons muſt bind the minority. This circumſtance alone might have convinced him of his error; for ſurely the minority, in this caſe, are bound without their conſent; nay, againſt their conſent. That a ſtate cannot tax its ſubjects without their conſent, is a raſh propoſition, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſubverſive of government. Locke himſelf has ſuggeſted the ſolid foundation of taxes, though inadvertently he lays no weight on it. I borrow his own words: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That every one who enjoys his ſhare of protection, ſhould pay out of his eſtate his proportion for the maintenance of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</q> The duties of ſovereign and of ſubject are reciprocal; and common juſtice requires, that a ſubject, or any perſon who is protected by a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ought to pay for that protection. Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances, without number, of ſuch reciprocal duties, occur in the laws of every civilized nation. A man calls for meat and drink in a tavern: is he not bound to pay the bill, though he made no agreement beforehand? A man is wafted over a river in a ferry-boat: muſt he not pay the common fare, though he made no promiſe? Nay, it is every man's intereſt to pay for protection: government cannot ſubſiſt without a public fund;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0032300302:264"/>
and what will become of individuals, when no longer protected, either in their perſons or goods? Thus taxes are implied in the very nature of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and the interpoſition of ſovereign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is only neceſſary ſo determining the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of a tax; and the quota, if found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
                  <p>Many writers, miſled by the reſpectable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Locke, boldly maintain, that a Britiſh parliament cannot legally tax the American colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, who are not repreſented in parliament. This propoſition, which has drawn the attention of the public of late years, has led me to be more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit on the power of impoſing taxes, than otherwiſe would be neceſſary. Thoſe who favour the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of our colonies, urge, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That a man ought to have the diſpoſal of what he acquires by honeſt induſtry, ſubject to no control: whence the neceſſity of a parliament for impoſing taxes, where every individual is either perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or by a repreſentative of his own election. The aid accordingly given to a Britiſh ſovereign is not a tribute, but a free and voluntary gift."</q> What is ſaid above will bring the diſpute within a very narrow compaſs. If our coloniſts be Britiſh ſubjects, which hitherto has not been controverted, they are ſubjected to the Britiſh legiſlature in every article of government; and as from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they have been protected by Britain, they ought, like other ſubjects, to pay for that protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There never was a time leſs favourable to their claim of freedom from taxes, than the cloſe of the late war with France. Had Britain ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably interpoſed, they would have been ſwallowed up by France, and become ſlaves to deſpotiſm.</p>
                  <p>If it be queſtioned, By what acts is a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to claim protection of government? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by ſetting his foot on the territory. If, upon
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0032300302:265"/>
landing at Dover, a foreigner be robbed, the law interpoſes for him as for a native. And, as he is thus protected, he pays for protection, when he purchaſes a pair of ſhoes, or a bottle of beer. The caſe is clear with reſpect to a man who can chuſe the place of his reſidence. But what ſhall be ſaid of children, who are not capable of choice, nor of conſent? They are protected, and protection implies the reciprocal duty of paying taxes. As ſoon as a young man is capable of acting for himſelf, he is at liberty to chuſe other protectors, if thoſe who have hitherto protected him be not agreeable.</p>
                  <p>If a legal power to impoſe taxes without conſent of the people did neceſſarily imply a legal power to impoſe taxes at pleaſure, without limitation, Locke's argument would be invincible, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of freedom at leaſt. A power to impoſe taxes at pleaſure would indeed be an invaſion of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental law of property; becauſe, under pretext of taxing, it would ſubject every man's property to the arbitrary will of the ſovereign. But the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has no weight, where the ſovereign's power is limited. The reciprocal duties between ſovereign and ſubject imply, that the people ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute what ſums are neceſſary for the ſupport of government, and that the ſovereign ought not to demand more. It is true, that there is no regular check againſt him, when he tranſgreſſes his duty in this particular: but there is an effectual check in the nature of every government, that is not legally deſpotic, viz. a general concert among all ranks, to vindicate their liberty againſt a courſe of violence and oppreſſion; and multiplied acts of that kind have more than once brought about ſuch a concert.</p>
                  <p>As every member of the body-politic is under protection of the government, every one of them,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0032300302:266"/>
as obſerved above, ought to pay for being protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and yet this propoſition has been controverted by an author of ſome note<note n="b" place="bottom">L'Ami des Hommes.</note>, who maintains, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the food and raiment furniſhed to the ſociety by huſbandmen and manufacturers, are all that theſe good people are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute: and ſuppoſing them bound to contribute more, it is not till others have done as much for the public."</q> At that rate, lawyers and phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ought alſo to be exempted from contributing; eſpecially thoſe who draw the greateſt ſums, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuppoſed to do the moſt good. That argument, the ſuggeſtion of a benevolent heart, is however no proof of an enlightened underſtanding. The labours of the farmer, of the lawyer, of the phyſician, contribute not a mite to the public fund, nor tend to defray the expence of government. The luxurious proprietor of a great eſtate has ſtill a better title to be exempted than the huſbandman, becauſe he is a great benefactor to the public, by giving bread to a variety of induſtrious people. In a word, every man ought to contribute for being protected; and if a huſbandman be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in working for himſelf one-and-fifty weeks yearly, he ought thankfully to work one week more, for defraying the expence of that protection.</p>

                  <head>DIFFERENT SORTS OF TAXES, with their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and Diſadvantages.</head>
                  <p>ALL taxes are laid upon perſons; but in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpects: a tax laid on a man perſonally, for himſelf and family, is termed a Capitation-tax; a tax laid on him for his property, is termed a Tax on goods. The latter is the only rational tax, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be proportioned to the ability of the proprietor. It has only one inconvenience, that his debts muſt be overlooked; becauſe, to take theſe into the account, would lead to endleſs intricacies. But there is an obvious remedy for that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience: let the man who complains get quit of his debts, by ſelling land or moveables; which will ſo far relieve him of the tax. Nor ought this meaſure to be conſidered as a hardſhip: it is ſeldom the intereſt of a landholder to be in debt; and, with reſpect to the public, the meaſure not only promotes the circulation of property, but is favourable to creditors, by procuring them pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A capitation-tax goes upon an erroneous principle, as if all men were of equal ability. What prompts it is, that many men, rich in bonds and other moveables, that can be eaſily hid from public inſpection, cannot be reached otherwiſe than by a capitation-tax. But as, by the very ſuppoſition, ſuch men cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the maſs of people, that mode of taxing, as miſerably unequal, is rarely practiſed among enlightened nations. Some years ago, a capitation-tax was impoſed in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0032300302:268"/>
obliging even day-labourers to pay for their wives and children. Upon the ſame abſurd plan, a tax was impoſed on marriage. One would be tempted to think, that population was intended to be diſcouraged. The Daniſh government, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have been ſenſible of the impropriety of ſuch taxes; for a tax impoſed on thoſe who obtain titles of honour from the crown, is applied for relieving huſbandmen of their capitation-tax. But a tax of this kind lies open to many other objections. It cannot fail to raiſe the price of labour, a poiſonous effect in a country of induſtry; for the labourer will relieve himſelf of the tax, by heightening his wages: more prudent it would be to lay the tax di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly on the employer, which would remove the pretext for heightening wages. The taxing of day-labourers has beſide an effect contrary to what is intended: inſtead of increaſing the public reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, it virtually leſſens it, by raiſing the pay of ſoldiers, ſailors, and of every workman employed by government.</p>
                  <p>Taxes upon goods are of two kinds, viz. upon things conſumable, and upon things not conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I begin with the latter. The land-tax in Britain, paid by the proprietor according to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable rule, and levied with very little expence, is, of all taxes, the moſt juſt, and the moſt effectual. The proprietor, fore-knowing the ſum he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to, prepares accordingly: and as each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor contributes in proportion to his eſtate, the tax makes no variation in their relative opulence. The only improvement it is ſuſceptible of is, the Athenian regulation, of exempting ſmall eſtates, that are no more than ſufficient to afford bread to the frugal proprietor. In France, the land-tax ſeems to have been eſtabliſhed on a very falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, viz. That the clergy perform their duty to the ſtate, by praying and inſtructing; that the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0032300302:269"/>
nobleſſe fight for the ſtate; and, conſequently, that the only duty left to the farmer is, to deſray the charges of government. This argument would hold, if the clergy were not paid for praying, and the nobleſſe for fighting. Such a load upon the pooreſt members of the ſtate is an abſurdity in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics. And, to render it ſtill more abſurd, the tax on the farmer is not impoſed by an invariable rule: every one is taxed in proportion to his apparent circumſtances, which, in effect, is to tax induſtry. Nor is this all: Under pretext of preventing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the exporting of corn, even from province to province, is ſrequently interrupted; by which it happens, that the corn of a plentiful year is deſtroyed by inſects, and in a year of ſcarcity is engroſſed by merchants. Suppoſe a plan were requeſted for diſcouraging agriculture, here is one actually put in execution, the ſucceſs of which is infallible. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Were it related,"</q> obſerves a French writer, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"in ſome foreign hiſtory, that there is a country ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fertile, in a fine climate, enjoying navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable rivers, with every advantage for the commerce of corn; and yet that the product is not ſufficient for the inhabitants: would not one conclude the people to be ſtupid and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? This, however, is the caſe of France."</q> He adds the true reaſon, which is, the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement huſbandry lies under by oppreſſive taxes. We have Diodorus Siculus for our autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the huſbandman was greatly reſpected in Hindoſtan. Among other nations, ſays he, the land, during war, lies untilled; but in Hindoſtan, huſbandmen are ſacred, and no ſoldier ventures to lay a hand on them. They are conſidered as ſervants of the public, who cannot be diſpenſed with.</p>
                  <p>It is a groſs error to maintain, that a tax on land is the ſame with a tax on the product of land.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0032300302:270"/>
The former, which is the Engliſh mode, is no diſcouragement to induſtry and improvements: on the contrary, the higher the value of land is raiſed, the leſs will the tax be in proportion. The latter, which is the French mode, is a great diſcouragement to induſtry and improvements; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more a man improves, the deeper he is taxed. The tenth part of the product of land is the only tax that is paid in China. This tax, of the ſame nature with our tithes paid to the clergy, yields to the Britiſh mode of taxing the land itſelf, and not its product; but is leſs excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable than the land-tax in France, becauſe it is not arbitrary. The Chineſe tax, paid in kind, is ſtored in magazines, and ſold from time to time for maintaining the magiſtrates and the army, the ſurplus being remitted to the treaſury. In caſe of famine, it is ſold to the poor people at a moderate price. In Tonquin there is a land-tax, which, like that in France, is laid upon peaſants, exempting people of condition, and the literati in particular. Many grounds that bear not corn contribute hay for the king's elephants and cavalry; which the poor peaſants are obliged to carry to the capital, even from the greateſt diſtance; a regulation no leſs ſlaviſh than impolitic.</p>
                  <p>The window-tax, the coach-tax, and the plate-tax come under the preſent head, being taxes upon things not conſumable. In Holland there is a tax on domeſtic ſervants, which deſerves well to be imitated. Var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty in Britain, and love of ſhow, have multiplied domeſtics, far beyond neceſſity, and even beyond convenience. A number of idlers collected in a luxurious family, become vitious and debauched; and many useful hands are withdrawn from huſbandry and manufactures. In order that the tax may reach none but the vain and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, thoſe who have but one ſervant pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0032300302:271"/>
two domeſtics ſubject the maſter to five ſhillings for each, three to ten ſhillings for each, four to twenty ſhillings, five to forty ſhillings, and ſo on, in a geometrical progreſſion. In Denmark, a farmer is taxed for every plough he uſes. If the tax be intended for diſcouraging extenſive farms, it is a happy contrivance, agreeable to ſound poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; for ſmall farms tend not only to population, but to rear a temperate and robuſt ſpecies of men, fit for every ſort of labour.</p>
                  <p>Next of taxes upon things conſumable. The taxes that appear the leaſt oppreſſive, becauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, are what are laid on our manufactures: the tax is advanced by the manufacturer, and drawn from the purchaſer as part of the price. In Rome, a tax was laid upon every man who purchaſed a ſlave. It is reported by ſome authors, that the tax was remitted by the Emperor Nero; and yet no alteration was made, but to oblige the vender to advance the tax. Hear Tacitus on that ſubject<note n="a" place="bottom">Annal. lib. 13.</note>: <q>Vectigal quintae et viceſimae venalium mancipiorum remiſſum, ſpecie magis quam vi; quia cum venditor pendere juberetur, in partem pretii emptoribus accreſcebat<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The tax of a twenty-fifth upon ſlaves to be ſold was remitted more in appearance than in reality; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the ſeller was ordered to pay it, he laid it upon the price to the buyer."</q>
                        </note>."</q> Thus, with reſpect to our taxes on ſoap, ſhoes, candles, and other things conſumable, the purchaſer thinks he is only paying the price, and never dreams that he is paying a tax. To ſupport the illuſion, the duly ought to be moderate: to impoſe a tax twenty times the value of the commodity, as done in France with reſpect to ſalt, raiſes more diſguſt in the people, as an attempt to deceive them, than
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0032300302:272"/>
when laid on without diſguiſe. Such exorbitant taxes, which are paid with the utmoſt reluctance, cannot be made effectual, but by ſevere penalties, equal to what are inflicted on the moſt atrocious criminals; which has a bad effect with reſpect to morals, as it tends to leſſen the horror one naturally conceives at great crimes.</p>
                  <p>Such taxes are attended with another ſignal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: they bear a ſtrict proportion to the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the contributors, the opulent being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the greateſt conſumers. The taxes on coaches and on plate are paid by men of fortune, without loading the induſtrious poor; and on that account are highly to be praiſed: being impoſed, however, without diſguiſe, they are paid with more reluctance by the rich, than taxes on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption are by the poor.</p>
                  <p>I add one other advantage of taxes on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. They are finely contrived to connect the intereſt of the ſovereign with that of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for his profit ariſes from their proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Such are the advantages of a tax on conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it muſt not be praiſed, as attended with no inconvenience The retailer, under pretext of the tax, raiſes the price higher than barely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify himſelf; by which means the tax is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doubled upon the conſumer. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, however, is but temporary. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,"</q> ſays Davenant, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"cannot laſt long; for every commodity in common uſe finds in the market its true value and price."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another inconvenience much more diſtreſſing becauſe it admits not a remedy, and becauſe it affects the ſtate itſelf. Taxes on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, being commonly laid on things of the greateſt uſe, raiſe a great ſum to the public, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much burdening individuals; the duty on coal,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0032300302:273"/>
for example, on candle, on leather, on ſoap, on ſalt, on malt, and on malt-liquor. Theſe duties, however, carry in their boſom a ſlow poiſon, by raiſing the price of labour and of manufactures. De Wit obſerves, that the Dutch taxes upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption have raiſed the price of their broad cloth forty per cent. and our manufactures, by the ſame means, are raiſed at leaſt thirty per cent. Britain has long laboured under this chronical diſtemper, which, by excluding her from foreign markets, will not only put an end to her own manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but will open a wide door to the foreign, as ſmuggling cannot be prevented, where commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities imported are much cheaper than our own.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought it to be overlooked, that taxes on conſumption are not equally proper in every ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. They are proper in a populous country, like Holland; becauſe the expence of collecting is but a trifle, compared with the ſums collected. But in a country thinly peopled, ſuch taxes are improper; becauſe the expence of collecting makes too great a proportion of the ſums collected: in the Highlands of Scotland, the exciſe on ale and ſpirits defrays not the expence of levying; the people are burdened, and the government is not ſupported.</p>
                  <p>A lottery is a ſort of tax different from any that have been mentioned. It is a tax of all the moſt agreeable, being entirely voluntary. An ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for gaming, inherent even in ſavages, prompts multitudes to venture their money, in hopes of the higheſt prize; though they cannot altogether hide from themſelves the inequality of the play. But lucky it is, that the ſelfiſh paſſions of men can be made ſubſervient to the public good Lotteries, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, produce one unhappy effect: they blunt the edge of induſtry, by directing the attention to a more
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0032300302:274"/>
compendious method of gain. At the ſame time, the money acquired by a lottery ſeldom turns to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for what comes without trouble goes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without thought.</p>

                  <head>MANNER OF LEVYING TAXES.</head>
                  <p>TO avoid the rapacity of farmers, a mild go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will, in moſt caſes, prefer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; i.e. it will levy taxes by officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe. Monteſquieu<note n="a" place="bottom">L'Eſprit des Loix, liv. 13. chap. 19.</note> has handled that point with his uſual ſprightly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</p>
                  <p>Importation-duties are commonly laid upon the importer before the cargo is landed, leaving him to add the duty to the price of goods; and facility of levying is the motive for preferring that method. But is it not hard, that the importer ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to advance a great ſum in the name of duty, before drawing a ſhilling by the ſale of his goods? It is not only hard, but groſsly unjuſt: for if the goods periſh without being ſold, the duty is loſt to the importer; he has no claim againſt the public for reſtitution. This has more the air of deſpotiſm than of a free government. Would it not be more equitable, that goods ſhould be lodged in a public warehouſe, under cuſtody of revenue-offcers, the importer paying the duty as the goods are ſold? By the preſent method, the duty remains
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0032300302:275"/>
with the collector three years, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid to the importer, if the goods be experted within that time: but, by the method propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the duty would be paid to the treaſury as the goods are ſold, which might be within a month from the time of importation, perhaps a week; and the treaſury would profit, as well as the fair trader. There are public ware-houſes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the cuſtom-houſe of Bourdeaux, where the ſugars of the French colonies are depoſited, till the importer finds a market; and he pays the duty gradually, as ſales are made. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices me, that the ſame method is practiſed in this iſland, with reſpect to ſome foreign articles neceſſary in our trade with Africa: the duty is not demanded till the goods are ſhipped for that continent. It is alſo put in practice with reſpect to foreign ſalt, and with reſpect to rum imported from our ſugar-colonies.</p>
                  <p>Beſide the equity of what is here propoſed, which relieves the importer from advance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and from riſk, many other advantages would be derived from it. In the firſt place, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, having no occaſion to reſerve any portion of his capital for anſwering the duty, would be enabled to commence trade with a ſmall ſtock, or to encreaſe his trade, if his ſtock be large: trade would flouriſh, and the public revenue would encreaſe in proportion. Secondly, It would leſſen ſmuggling. Many a one who commences trade with upright intention, is tempted to ſmuggle for want of ready money to pay the duty. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This manner of levying the duty would not only abridge the number of officers, but remove every pretext for claiming diſcount on preſence of leakage, ſamples, and the drying or ſhrinking of goods. In the preſent manner of levying, that

diſcount muſt be left to the diſcretion of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer: a private underſtanding is thus introduced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the merchant, hurtful to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and deſtructive to morals. Fourthly, the merchant would be enabled to lower his prices, and be forced to lower them, by having many rivals; which, at the ſame time, would give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to augment importation-duties, without raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price of foreign commodities above what it is at preſent. But the capital advantage of all would be, to render, in effect, every port in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a free port, enabling Engliſh merchants, many of whom have great capitals, to outſtrip foreigners in what is termed A COMMERCE OF SPECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATION. This iſland is well ſituated for ſuch commerce; and were our ports free, the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all climates would be ſtored up in them, ready for exportation, when a market offers; an excellent plan for encreaſing our ſhipping, and for producing boundleſs wealth.</p>

                  <head>RULES TO BE OBSERVED in TAXING.</head>
                  <p>THE different objects of taxes, and the intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereby occaſioned, require general rules, not only for directing the legiſlature in impoſing them, but for enabling others to judge what are beneficial, and what hurtful.</p>
                  <p>The firſt rule I ſhall ſuggeſt is. That wherever there is an opportunity of ſmuggling, taxes ought to be moderate; for ſmuggling can never effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be reſtrained, where the cheapneſs of imported goods is in effect an enſurance againſt the riſk; in which view, Swift humorouſly obſerves, that two and two do not always make four. A duty of 15 per cent. upon printed linen imported into France, encourages ſmuggling: a lower duty would produce a greater ſum to the public, and be more beneficial to the French manufacturer. Bone-lace imported into France is charged with a duty of 20 per cent in order to favour that manufacture at home: but in vain; for bone-lace is eaſily ſmuggled, and the price is little higher than before. The high duty on <q rend="inline">"ſuccus liquoritiae"</q> imported into Britain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing L. 7: 2: 6 per hundred weight, was a great encouragement to ſmuggling; for which reaſon it is reduced to 30s. per hundred weight<note n="a" place="bottom">7<hi rend="sup">0</hi> Geo. III. cap. 47.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The ſmuggling of tea, which extracts great ſums from Britain, is much encouraged by its high price at home. As far as I can judge, it would be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, both to the public and to individuals, to lay
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0032300302:278"/>
aſide the importation-duty, and to ſubſtitute in its ſtead a duty on the conſumer. Freedom of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would enable the Eaſt-India company to ſell ſo cheap, as effectually to baniſh ſmuggling; and the low price of tea would enable the conſumer to pay a pretty ſmart duty, without being much out of pocket. The following mode is propoſed merely as an example: it is a hint that may lead to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. Let every man who uſes tea be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a moderate tax, proportioned to his mode of living. Abſolute preciſion cannot be expected in proportioning the tax on families; but groſs ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality may eaſily be prevented. For inſtance, let the mode of living be determined by the equipage that is kept. A coach or chaiſe with two horſes ſhall ſubject a family to a yearly tax of L. 10, heightening the tax in proportion to the number of horſes and carriages; two ſervants in livery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a carriage, to a tax of 40s. ; every other family paying 20s. Every family where tea is uſed muſt be entered in the collector's books, with its mode of living, under a heavy penalty; which would regulate the coach-tax, as well as that on tea. Such a tax, little expenſive in levying, would undoubtedly be effectual: a maſter of a family is imprudent indeed, if he puts it in the power of the vender, of a malicious neighbour, or of a menial ſervant, to ſubject him to a heavy penalty. This tax at the ſame time would be the leaſt diſagreeable of any that is levied without diſguiſe; being in effect a voluntary tax, as the mode of living is voluntary. Nor would it be difficult to temper the tax, ſo as to afford a greater ſum to the public than it receives at preſent from the importation-duty, and yet to coſt our people no more for tea than they pay at preſent, taking into computation the high price of that commodity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0032300302:279"/>
High duties on importation are immoral, as well as impolitic; and it would be unjuſtifiable in the legiſlature, firſt to tempt, and then to puniſh for yielding to the temptation.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond rule is, That taxes expenſive in the levying ought to be avoided; being heavy on the people, without a proportional benefit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. Our land-tax is admirable: it affords a great ſum, levied with very little expence. The duties on coaches, and on gold and ſilver plate, are ſimilar; and ſo would be the tax on tea above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The taxes that are the moſt hurtful to trade and manufactures, ſuch as the duty on ſoap, candle, leather, are expenſive in levying.</p>
                  <p>A third rule is, To avoid arbitrary taxes. They are diſguſtful to all, not excepting thoſe who are favourably treated; becauſe ſelf-partiality ſeldom permits a man to think, that juſtice is done him in ſuch matters. A tax laid on perſons in proportion to their trade, or their opulence, muſt be arbitrary, even where ſtrict juſtice is intended; becauſe it depends on the vague opinion or conjecture of the collector: every man thinks himſelf injured; and the ſum levied does not balance the diſcontent it occaſions. The tax laid on the French farmer in proportion to his ſubſtance, is an intolerable grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and a great engine of oppreſſion: if the farmer exerts any activity in melicrating his land, he is ſure to be doubly taxed. Hamburgh affords the only inſtance of a tax on trade and riches, that is willingly paid, and that conſequently is levied without oppreſſion. Every merchant puts private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the public cheſt, the ſum that in his own opinion he ought to contribute: A ſingular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of integrity in a great trading town; for there is no ſuſpicion of wrong in that tacit contribution. But this ſtate is not yet corrupted by luxury.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0032300302:280"/>
Becauſe many vices that poiſon a nation ariſe from inequality of riches, I propoſe it as a fourth rule, to remedy that inequality as much as poſſible, by relieving the poor, and burdening the rich. Proprietors of overgrown eſtates can bear without inconvenience very heavy taxes; and thoſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally who convert much land from profit to pleaſure, ought not to be ſpared. Would it not contribute greatly to the public good, that a tax of L. 50 ſhould be laid on every houſe that has 50 windows; L. 150 on houſes of 100 windows; and L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>00 on houſes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>00 windows? By the ſame principle, every deer-park of 200 acres ought to pay L. 50; of 500 acres L. 200; and of 1000 acres L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>00. Fifty acres of pleaſure ground to pay L. 30; 100 ſuch acres L. 80; 150 acres L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>0; and 200 acres L. 300. Such a tax would have another good effect: it would probably move high minded men to leave out more ground for maintenance of the poor, than they are commonly inclined to do.</p>
                  <p>A fifth rule of capital importance, as it regards the intereſt of the ſtate in general, is, That every tax which tends to impoveriſh the nation ought to be rejected with indignation. Such taxes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the very nature of government, which is to protect, not to oppreſs. And ſuppoſing the intereſt of the governing power to be only regarded, a ſtate is not meaſured by the extent of its territory, but by what the ſubjects are able to pay annually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. A ſovereign, however regardleſs of his duty as father of his people, will regard that rule for his own ſake: a nation impoveriſhed by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive taxes will reduce the ſovereign at laſt to the ſame poverty; for he cannot levy what they cannot pay.</p>
                  <p>Whether taxes impoſed on common neceſſaries, which fall heavy upon the labouring poor, be of the kind now mentioned, deſerves the moſt ſerious
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0032300302:281"/>
conſideration. Where they tend to promote induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they are highly ſalutary: where they deprive us of foreign markets, by raiſing the price of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and of manufactures, they are highly noxio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In ſome caſes, induſtry may be promoted by taxes, without raiſing the price of labour and of manufactures. Tobolſki in Siberia is a populous town, the price of vivres is extremely low, and the people on that account are extremely idle. While they are maſters of a farthing, they work none: when they are pinched with hunger, they gain in a day what maintains them a week: they never think of to-morrow, nor of providing againſt want. A tax there upon neceſſaries would probably excite ſome degree of induſtry. Such a tax, renewed from time to time, and augmented gradually, would promote induſtry more and more, ſo as to ſqueeze out of that lazy people three, four, or even five days labour weekly, without raiſing their wages, or the price of their work. But beware of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule. The effect would be very different in Britain, where moderate labour, without much relaxation, is requiſite for living comfortably: in every ſuch caſe, a permanent tax upon neceſſaries will not fail in time to raiſe the price of labour. It is true, that in a ſingle year of ſcarcity there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more labour, and even better living, than in plentiful years. But ſuppoſe ſcarcity to continue a number of years ſucceſſively, or ſuppoſe a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent tax on neceſſaries, wages muſt riſe till the labourer finds comfortable living: if the employer obſtinately ſtands out, the labourer will in deſpair abandon work altogether, and commence beggar; or will retire to a country leſs burdened with taxes. Hence a ſalutary doctrine, That where expence of living equals, or nearly equals, what is gained by bodily labour, moderate taxes renewed from time to time after conſiderable intervals, will promote
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0032300302:282"/>
induſtry, without raiſing the price of labour; but that permanent taxes will unavoidably raiſe the price of labour, and of manufactures. In Holland, the high price of proviſions and of labour, occaſioned by permanent taxes, have excluded from the foreign market every one of their manufactures that can be ſupplied by other nations. Heavy taxes have put an end to their once flouriſhing manufactures of wool, of ſilk, of gold and ſilver, and many others. The prices of labour and of manufactures have in England been immoderately raiſed by the ſame means.</p>
                  <p>To prevent a total downfall of our manufactures, ſeveral political writers have given their opinion, that the labouring poor ought to be diſburdened of all taxes. The royal tithe propoſed for France, inſtead of all other taxes, publiſhed in the name of Mareſchal Vauban, or ſuch a tax laid upon land in England, might originally have produced wonders. But the expedient would now come too late, at leaſt in England: ſuch profligacy have the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates produced among the lower ranks, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them from taxes, would probably make them work leſs, but aſſuredly would not make them work cheaper. It is vain therefore to think of a remedy againſt idleneſs and high wages, while the poor-rates ſubſiſt in their preſent form. Davenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, that the Engliſh poor-rates will in time be the bane of their manufactures. He computes, that the perſons receiving alms in England amount to one million and two hundred thouſand, the half of whom at leaſt would have continued to work, had they not relied on pariſh-charity. But of this more at large in a ſeparate ſketch.</p>
                  <p>Were the poor-rates aboliſhed, a general act of naturalization would not only augment the ſtrength of Britain, by adding to the number of its people,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0032300302:283"/>
but would compel the natives to work cheaper, and conſequently to be more induſtrious.</p>
                  <p>If theſe expedients be not reliſhed, the only one that remains for preſerving our manufactures is, to encourage their exportation by a bounty, ſuch as may enable us to cope with our rivals in foreign markets. But where is the fund for a bounty ſo extenſive? It may be raiſed out of land, like the Athenian tax above mentioned, burdening great proprietors in a geometrical proportion, and freeing thoſe who have not above L. 100 of land-rent. That tax would raiſe a great ſum to the public, without any real loſs to thoſe who are burdened; for comparative riches would remain the ſame as formerly. Nay, ſuch a tax would in time prove highly beneficial to land-proprietors; for by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting induſtry and commerce, it would raiſe the rent of land much above the contribution. Can money be laid out ſo advantageouſly at common intereſt? And to reconcile land-holders to the tax, may it not be thought ſufficient, that, without a bounty, our foreign commerce muſt vaniſh, and land be reduced to its original low value? Can any man heſitate about paying a ſhilling, when it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him againſt loſing a pound?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall cloſe with a rule of deeper concern than all that have been mentioned, which is, To avoid taxes that require the oath of party. They are <q rend="inline">"contra bonos mores,"</q> as being a temptation to perjury. Few there are ſo wicked, as to hurt others by perjury: at the ſame time, there are not many of the lower ranks ſo upright, as to ſcruple much at perjury, when it prevents hurt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Conſider the duty on candle. Thoſe only who brew for ſale, pay the duty on malt-liquor; and to avoid the brewer's oath, the quantity is aſcertained by officers who attend the proceſs. But the duty on candle is oppreſſive, not only as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0032300302:284"/>
poor people who make no candle for ſale, but as ſubjecting them to give oath on the quantity they make for their own uſe. Figure a poor widow, burthened with five or ſix children: ſhe is not permitted to make ready a little food for her infants, by the light of a rag dipped in greaſe, without paying what ſhe has not to pay, or being guilty of perjury. However upright originally, poverty and anxiety about her infants will tempt her to conceal the truth, and to deny upon oath:—a ſad leſſon to her poor children: ought they to be puniſhed for copying after their mother, whom they love and revere? whatever ſhe does appears right in their eyes. The manner of levying the ſalt-tax in France is indeed arbitrary; but it is not productive of immorality: an oath is avoided; and every maſter of a family pays for the quantity he is preſumed to conſume. French wine is often imported into Britain as Spaniſh, which pays leſs duty. To check that fraud, the importer's oath is required; and if perjury be ſuſpected, a jury is ſet upon him in exchequer. This is horrid: the importer is tempted by a high duty on French wine to commit perjury; for which he is proſecuted in a ſovereign court, open to all the world: he turns deſperate, and loſes all ſenſe of honour. Thus cuſtom-houſe oaths have become a proverb, as meriting no regard; and corruption creeping on, will become univerſal. Some goods imported pay a duty <q rend="inline">"ad valorem;"</q> and to aſcertain the value the importer's oath is required. In China, the books of the merchant are truſted, without an oath. Why not imitate ſo laudable a practice? If our people be more corrupted, perjury may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ordaining the merchant to deliver his goods to any who will demand them, at the rate ſtated in his books; with the addition of ten per cent. as a ſufficient profit to himſelf. Oaths have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0032300302:285"/>
multiplied in Britain ſince the Revolution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, and contrary to ſound policy. New oaths have been contrived againſt thoſe who are diſaffected to the government; againſt fictious titles in electing parliament-members; againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding the revenue, &amp;c. &amp;c. They have been ſo hackneyed, and have become ſo familiar, as to be held a matter of form merely. Perjury has dwindled into a venial tranſgreſſion, and is ſcarce held an imputation on any man's character. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable indeed has been the conduct of our legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature: inſtead of laws for reforming or improving morals, the imprudent multiplication of oaths has not only ſpread corruption through every rank, but, by annihilating the authority of an oath over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, has rendered it entirely uſeleſs.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                  <head>EXAMINATION OF BRITISH TAXES.</head>
                  <p>THERE is no political ſubject of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to Britain, than the preſent: a whole life might be profitably beſtowed on it, and a large volume. My part is only to ſuggeſt hints; which will occur in conſidering taxes with regard to their effects. And in that view, they may be commodiouſly diſtinguiſhed into five kinds. Firſt, Taxes that encreaſe the public revenue, without producing any other effect, good or bad. Second, Taxes that encreaſe the public revenue; and are alſo beneficial to manufactures and commerce. Third, Taxes that encreaſe the public revenue; but are hurtful to manufactures and commerce. Fourth, Taxes that are hurtful to manufactures and commerce, without encreaſing the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. Fifth, Taxes that are hurtful to manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commerce; and alſo leſſen the public revenue. I proceed to inſtances of each kind.</p>
                  <p>The land-tax is an illuſtrious inſtance of the firſt kind: it produces a revenue to the public, levied with very little expence: and it hurts no mortal; for a landholder who pays for having himſelf and his eſtate protected, cannot be ſaid to be hurt. The duty on coaches is of the ſame kind. Both taxes at the ſame time are agreeable to ſound principles. Men ought to contribute to the public revenue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the benefit that protection affords them: a rich man requires protection for his poſſeſſions, as well as for his perſon, and therefore ought to contribute largely: a poor man requires protection
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0032300302:287"/>
for his perſon only, and therefore ought to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute very little.</p>
                  <p>A tax on foreign luxuries is an inſtance of the ſecond kind. It encreaſes the public revenue; and it greatly benefits individuals; not only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the conſumption of foreign luxuries, but by encouraging our own manufactures of that kind. Britain enjoys a monopoly of coal exported to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and the duty on exportation is agreeable to ſound policy, being paid by the Dutch. This duty is an inſtance of the ſecond kind: it raiſes a conſiderable revenue to the public; and it enables us to cope with the Dutch in every manufacture that employs coal, ſuch as dying, diſtilling, works of glaſs and of iron. And theſe manufactures in Britain, by the dearneſs of labour, are entitled to ſome aid. A tax on horſes, to prevent their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, would be a tax of the ſame kind. The incredible number of horſes uſed in coaches and other wheel-carriages, has raiſed the price of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by doubling the price of oat-meal, the food of the labouring poor in many parts of Britain. The price of wheat is alſo raiſed by the ſame means; becauſe the vaſt quantity of land employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in producing oats, leaves ſo much the leſs for wheat. I would not exempt even plough-horſes from the tax; becauſe in every view it is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to uſe oxen<note n="*" place="bottom">They are preſerable for huſbandry in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. They are cheaper than horſes: their food, their harneſs, their ſhoes, the attendance on them, much leſs expenſive; and their dung much better for land. Horſes are more ſubject to diſeaſes, and when diſeaſed or old are totally uſeleſs; upon which account, a ſtock of horſes for a farm, muſt be renewed at leaſt every ten years; whereas a ſtock of oxen may be kept entire for ever without any new expence, as they will always draw a full price when fatted for food. Nor is a horſe more docile than an ox: a couple of oxen in a plough require not a driver more than a couple of horſes. The Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope plough with oxen; and exerciſe them early to a quick pace, ſo as to equal horſes both in the plough and in the waggon. The people of Malabar uſe no other animal for the plough nor for burdens. About Pondichery no beaſts of burden are to be ſeen but oxen. The vaſt increaſe of horſes of late years for luxury as well as for draught, makes a great conſumption of oats. If in huſbandry oxen only were uſed, which require no oats, many thouſand acres would be ſaved for wheat and barley. But the advantages of oxen would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the farmer. Beef would become much cheaper to the manufacturer, by the vaſt addition of fat oxen ſent to market; and the price of leather and tallow would fall; a national benefit, as every one uſes ſhoes and candles.</note>. So little regard is paid
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0032300302:288"/>
to theſe conſiderations, that a coach, whether drawn by two horſes or by ſix, pays the ſame duty.</p>
                  <p>As to the third kind, I am grieved to obſerve, that we have many taxes more hurtful to individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als than advantageous to the public revenue. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied taxes on the neceſſaries of life, candle, ſoap, leather, ale, ſalt, &amp;c. raiſe the price of labour, conſequently of manufactures. If they ſhall have the effect to deprive us of foreign markets, which we have reaſon to dread, depopulation and poverty muſt enſue. The ſalt-tax in particular is more out of rule than any of the others mentioned: with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe, the rich bear the greateſt burden, being the greateſt conſumers; but the ſhare they pay of the ſalt-tax is very little, becauſe they never touch ſalt proviſions. The ſalt-tax is ſtill more abſurd in another reſpect, ſalt being a choice of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0032300302:289"/>
manure for land. One would be amazed to hear of a law prohibiting the uſe of lime as a manure: he would be ſtill more amazed to hear of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition being extended to ſalt, which is a manure much ſuperior: and yet a heavy tax on ſalt, which renders it too dear for being uſed as a manure, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes no man. But the mental eye, when left without culture, reſembles that of the body: it ſeldom perceives but what is directly before it: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and conſequences go far out of ſight. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand quarters of good wheat have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with-held from Britain by the ſalt-tax. What the treaſury has gained will not amount to the fiftieth part of that loſs The abſurdity of with holding from us a manure ſo profitable has at laſt been diſcovered; and remedied in part, by permitting Engliſh foul ſalt to be uſed for manure, on paying four pence of duty per buſhel<note n="b" place="bottom">8<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Geo. III. cap. 25.</note>. Why was not Scotland permitted to taſte of that bounty? Our candidates, it would appear, are more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of a ſeat in parliament, than of ſerving their country when they have obtained that honour.</p>
                  <p>The window-tax is more detrimental to the common intereſt than advantageous to the public revenue. In the firſt place, it promot s large farms in order to ſave houſes and windows; whereas ſmall farms tend to multiply a hardy and frugal race, uſeful for every purpoſe. In the next place, it is a diſcouragement to manufactures, by taxing the houſes in which they are carried on. Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, in order to relieve themſelves as much as poſſible from the tax, make the whole ſide of their houſe a ſingle window; and there are inſtances where in three ſtories there are but three windows. The tax, at the ſame time, is impoſed with no
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0032300302:290"/>
degree of equality: a houſe in a paultry village that affords not five pounds of yearly rent, may have a greater number of windows than one in London rented at fifty. In this reſpect it runs counter to ſound policy, by eaſing the rich, and burdening the poor. The ſame objection lies againſt the plate-tax. It is not indeed hurtful to manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commerce: but it is hurtful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt; becauſe plate converted into money may be the means of ſaving the nation at a criſis, and therefore ought to be encouraged, inſtead of being loaded with a tax. On pictures imported into Britain, a duty is laid in proportion to the ſize. Was there no intelligent perſon at hand, to inform our legiſlature, that the only means to rouſe a genius for painting, is to give our youth ready acceſs to good pictures? Till theſe be multiplied in Britain, we never ſhall have the reputation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a good painter. So far indeed it is lucky, that the moſt valuable pictures are not loaded with a greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>8 per cent. by an arbitrary eſtimation of the value. This tax is an irreparable injury to France, by diſcouraging the multiplication of ſeamen. It is beneficial indeed in one view, as it tends to check the growing population of that great city.</p>
                  <p>Without waiting to rummage the Britiſh taxes for examples of the fourth kind, I ſhall preſent my reader with a foreign inſtance. In the Auſtrian Netherlands, there are inexhauſtible mines of coal, the exportation of which would make a conſiderable article of commerce, were it not abſolutely barred by an exorbitant duty. This abſurd duty is a great injury to proprietors of coal, without yielding a farthing to the government. The Dutch many years ago offered to confine themſelves to that country for coal, on condition of being relieved
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0032300302:291"/>
from the duty; which would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> down the price below that of Britiſh coal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> wonderful, that the propoſal was rejected? But miniſters ſeldom regard what is beneficial to the nation, unleſs it produce an immediate benefit to their ſovereign or to themſelves. The coal mines in the Auſtrian Netherlands being thus ſhut up, and the art of working them loſt, the Britiſh enjoy the monopoly of exporting coal to Holland.</p>
                  <p>The duty on coal water-borne is an inſtance of the fifth kind. A great obſtruction it is to many uſeful manufactures that require coal; and indeed to manufactures in general, by increaſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of coal, an eſſential article in a cold country. Nay, one would imagine, that it has been intended to check population; as poor wretches, benumbed with cold, feel little of the carnal appetite. It has not even the merit of adding much to the public revenue; for, laying aſide London, it produces but a mere triſle. But the peculiarity of this tax, which intitles it to a conſpicuous place in the fifth claſs, is, that it is not leſs detrimental to the public revenue than to individuals. No ſedentary art nor occupation can ſucceed in a cold climate without plenty of ſewel. One may at the firſt glance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the coal-countries from the reſt of England, by the induſtry of the inhabitants, and by plenty of manufacturing towns and villages. Where there is ſcarcity of fewel, ſome hours are loſt every morning; becauſe people cannot work till the place be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warmed, which is eſpecially the caſe in manufactures that require a ſoft and delicate finger. Now, in many parts of Britain which might be provided with coal by water, the labouring poor are deprived of that comfort by the tax. Had cheap firing encouraged theſe people to proſecute arts and manufactures; it is more than probable, that at this day they would be contributing to the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0032300302:292"/>
public revenue by other duties, much greater ſums than are drawn from them by the duty on coal. At the ſame time, if coal muſt pay a duty, why not at the pit, where it is the cheapeſt? Is it not an egregious blunder, to lay a great duty on thoſe who pay a high price for coal, and no duty on thoſe who have it cheap? If there muſt be a coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty, let water-borne coal at any rate be exempted; not only becauſe even without duty it comes dear to the conſumer, but alſo for the encouragement of ſeamen. For the honour of Britain this duty ought to be expunged from our ſtatute book, never again to ſhow its face. Great reaſon indeed there is for continuing the duty on coal conſumed in London; becauſe every artifice ſhould be put in practice, to prevent the increaſe of a head, that is already too large for the body, or for any body Towns are unhealthy in proportion to their ſize; and a great town like London is a greater enemy to population than war or ſamine.</p>

                  <p>OF all ſciences, that of politics is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate; and its progreſs toward maturity is ſlow in proportion. In the preſent ſection, taxes on exportation of native commodities take the lead; and nothing can ſet in a ſtronger light the groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of former ages, than a maxim univerſally adopted, That to tax exportation, or to prohibit it altogether, is the beſt means for having plenty at home. In Scotland we were not ſatisfied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the exportation of corn, of fiſh, and of horſes: the prohibition was extended to manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; linen cloth, for example, candle, butter, cheeſe, barked hides, ſhoes<note n="*" place="bottom">Oil was the only commodity that by the laws of Solon was permitted to be exported from Attica. The figs of that country, which are delicious, came to be produced in ſuch plenty, that there was no ſufficient conſumpt for them at home; and yet the law prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting exportation was not abrogated. Sycophant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a perſon who informs againſt the exporter of figs: but the prohibition appearing abſurd, ſycophant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a term of reproach.</note>

                  <p>Duties on exportation are in great favour from a notion that they are paid by foreigners. This holds ſometimes, as in the above-mentioned caſe of coal exported to Holland: but it fails in every caſe where
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0032300302:294"/>
the foreign market can be ſupplied by others; for whatever be the duty, the merchant muſt regulate his price by the market. And even ſuppoſing the market-price at preſent to be ſufficient for the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a reaſonable profit to the exporter, thoſe who pay no duty will ſtrain every nerve of rivalſhip, till they cut us out by low prices. The duty on French wine exported from France, is equal to a bounty to the wines of neighbouring countries. At the ſame time, the duty is unſkilfully impoſed, being the ſame upon all wines exported, without regard to flavour or ſtrength: which bars the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of ſmall wines, though much more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. A moderate duty on exportation, ſuch as ſmall wines can bear, would add a greater ſum to the revenue, and alſo be more beneficial to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. To improve the commerce of wine in France, the exportation ought to be free, or, at moſt, charged with a moderate duty ad valorem. In Spain an exceſſive duty is laid upon the plant barrile when exported; from a perſuaſion that it will not grow in any other country. It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that this tax, by leſſening the demand, is a diſcouragement to its culture. A moderate duty would raiſe more money to the public, would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy more hands, and would make that plant a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent article of commerce. The exceſſive duty has ſet invention at work, for ſome material in place of that plant. If ſuch a material ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the Spaniſh miniſtry will be convinced of a ſalutary maxim, That it is not always ſafe, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt by high duties the free courſe of commerce. Formerly in Britain the exportation of manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed copper was prohibited. That blunder in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial politics was corrected by a ſtatute in the reign of King William, permitting ſuch copper to be exported, on paying a duty of four ſhillings the hundred weight. The exportation ought to have
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0032300302:295"/>
been declared free; which was done by a ſtatute of Queen Anne. But as people are apt to overdo in the rage of improvement, this ſtatute permits even unwrought copper, a raw material, to be exported. This probably was to favour copper-mines: but did it not alſo ſavour foreign copper-manufactures? Goods and merchandize of the product or manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Great Britain may be exported duty free<note n="b" place="bottom">George I. cap. 14. act 8.</note>. Alum, lead, and ſome other commodities ſpecified in the ſtatute, are excepted; and a duty formerly paid on exportation is continued, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging ſuch of our own manufactures as employ any of the articles ſpecified. In Ireland to this day, goods exported are loaded with a high duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even diſtinguiſhing made work from raw mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; corn, for example, fiſh, hops, butter, horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cattle, wrought iron, leather, and every thing made of it, &amp;c. &amp;c. And that nothing may eſcape, all goods exported that are not contained in the book of rates, pay 5 per cent. ad valorem.</p>
                  <p>When Sully entered on the adminiſtration of the French finances, the corn in France was at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant price, occaſioned by neglect of huſbandry during the civil war. That ſagacious miniſter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſecret of re-eſtabliſhing agriculture, and of reducing the price of corn, which is, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a free exportation. So rapid was the ſucceſs of that bold but politic meaſure, that in a few years France became the granary of Europe; and what at preſent may appear wonderful, we find in the Engliſh records, anno 1621, bitter complaints of the French underſelling them in their own markets. Colbert, who, fortunately for us, had imbibed the common error, renewed the ancient prohibition of exporting corn, hoping to have it cheap at home for his manufacturers. But he was in a groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0032300302:296"/>
for that prohibition has been the chief cauſe of many famines in France ſince that time. The corn-trade in France lay long under great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements; and the French miniſtry continued long blind to the intereſt of their country. At laſt edicts were iſſued, authoriſing the commerce of corn to be abſolutely free, whether ſold within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or exported. The generality however conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued blind. In the year 1768, the badneſs of the harveſt having occaſioned a famine, the diſtreſſes of the people were exceſſive, and their complaints uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. Overlooking altogether the bad harveſt, they, from amazing partiality, attributed their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to the new law. It was in vain inculcated, that freedom in the corn-trade encourages agriculture: the popular opinion was adopted even by moſt of the parliaments; ſo difficult it is to eradicate eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prejudices. In Turky, about thirty years ago, a grand vizir permitted corn to be exported more freely than had been done formerly, a buſhel of wheat being ſold at that time under ſeventeen pence. Every nation flocked to Turky for corn; and in particular no fewer than three hundred French veſſels, from twenty to two hundred tons, entered Smyrna bay in one day. The Janiſſaries and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace took the alarm, fearing that all the corn would be exported, and that a famine would enſue. In Conſtantinople they grew mutinous, and could not be appeaſed till the vizir was ſtrangled, and his body thrown out to them. His ſucceſſor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to ſplit on the ſame rock, prohibited ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation abſolutely. In that country, rent is paid in proportion to the product; and the farmers, who ſaw no demand, neglected tillage. In leſs than three years the buſhel of wheat roſe to ſix ſhillings, and the diſtreſſes of the people became intolerable. To this day, the fate of the good vizir is lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

We have improved upon Sully's diſcovery, by a bounty on corn exported, which has anſwered our moſt ſanguine expectations. A great increaſe of gold and ſilver ſubſequent to the ſaid bounty, which has raiſed the price of many other commodities, muſt have alſo raiſed that of corn, had not ſtill a greater increaſe of corn, occaſioned by the bounty, reduced its price even below what it was formerly; and by that means our manufactures have profited by the bounty no leſs than our huſbandry. The bounty is ſtill more important in another reſpect: agriculture in France lies under many diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the greateſt of which is, that our wheat can be afforded as cheap in their markets as their own: and by prohibiting exportation, it is in our power, during a war, to daſh all the French ſchemes for conqueſt, by depriving them of bread<note n="*" place="bottom">Between the years 1715 and 1755 there was of wheat exported from England into France twenty one millions of ſeptiers, eſtimated at two hundred millions of livres. The bounty for exporting corn has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amounted to L. 150,000 for a ſingle year. But this ſum is not all loſt to the public; for frequently our corn is exchanged with goods that pay a high duty on importation.</note>. This bounty therefore is our palladium, which we ought religiouſly to guard, if we would avoid being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of France. Some ſage politicians have begun of late to mutter againſt the bounty, as feeding our rival manufacturers cheaper than our own; which is a miſtake, for the expence of exportation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly equals the bounty. But ſuppoſing it true, will the evil be remedied by withdrawing the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? On the contrary, it will diſcourage manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by raiſing the price of wheat at home. It will beſide encourage French huſbandry, ſo as in all probability to reduce the price of their wheat below what we aſſord it to them. In France, labour is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0032300302:298"/>
cheaper than in England, the people are more fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, they poſſeſs a better ſoil and climate: what have we to balance theſe ſignal advantages but our bounty? and were that bounty withdrawn, I ſhould not be ſurpriſed to ſee French corn poured in upon us, at a lower price than it can be furniſhed at home; the very game that was played againſt us, during Sully's adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>The exportation of Britiſh manufactures to our American colonies ought to meet with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as to prevent them from rivalling us: it would be a groſs blunder to encourage their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, by impoſing a duty on what we export to them. We ought rather to give a bounty on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; which, by underſelling them in their own markets, would quaſh every attempt to rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>As the duty on foreign linen imported into Britain is drawn back when exported to America, our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature gave a bounty on our coarſe linen exported to that country, which enables us to cope with the Germans in the American markets. The ſtaining, or printing of linen cloth, has of late become a conſiderable article in the manufactures of Britain; and there is no ſort of linen more proper for that manufacture than our own. The duty of foreign linen is drawn back when exported to America, whether plain or ſtamped: and as we loſe the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on our coarſe linen when ſtamped, none but fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign linen is employed in the ſtamping manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is an overſight ſuch as our legiſlature is guilty of ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>It is not always true policy, to diſcourage the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of our own rude materials: liberty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation gives encouragement to produce them in greater plenty at home; which conſequently lowers the price to our manufacturers. Upon that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the exporting corn is permitted, and in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0032300302:299"/>
even encouraged with a bounty. But where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of a rude material will not encreaſe its quantity, the prohibition is good policy, For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the exporting of rags for paper may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; becauſe liberty of exporting will not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion one yard more of linen cloth to be conſumed.</p>
                  <p>Lyons is the city of Europe where the greateſt quantity of ſilk ſtuffs is made: it is at the ſame time the greateſt ſtaple of raw ſilk; the ſilk of Italy, of Spain, of the Levant, and of the ſouth of France, being there collected. The exportation of raw ſilk is prohibited in France, with a view to leſſen its price at home, and to obſtruct the ſilk-manufacture among foreigners. The firſt is a groſs error; the prohibition of exportation producing ſcarcity, not plenty: and with reſpect to the other view, it ſeems to have been overlooked, that the commerce of the ſilks of Italy, of Spain, and of the Levant, is not confined to France, but is open to all trading nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This prohibition is indeed ſo injudicious, that without any benefit to France, it has done irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſchief to the city of Lyons: while the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of raw ſilk, both buying and ſelling, was monopolized by the merchants of that city, they had it in their power to regulate the price; but to compel foreigners to go to the fountain-head, not only raiſes the price by concurrence of purchaſers, but deprives Lyons of a lucrative monopoly. The ſame blunder is repeated with reſpect to raw ſilk ſpun and dyed. In Lyons, ſilk is prepared for the loom with more art than any where elſe; and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſilk-manufacture, the exportation of ſpun ſilk is prohibited; which muſt rouſe foreigners to beſtow their utmoſt attention upon improving the ſpinning and dreſſing of ſilk: and who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reiterated trials by perſons of genius, may not, in England for example, bring theſe branches of the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0032300302:300"/>
manufacture to greater perfection, than they are even in Lyons?</p>
                  <p>Whether we have not committed a blunder of the ſame kind in prohibiting exportation of our wool, is a very ſerious queſtion, which I proceed to examine. A ſpirit for huſbandry, and for every ſort of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, is in France turning more and more general. In ſeveral provinces there are ſocieties, who have command of public money for promoting agriculture; and about no other article are theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties more ſolicitous, than about improving the ſtaple of their wool. A book lately publiſhed in Sweden, and tranſlated into French, has inſpired them with ſanguine hopes of ſucceſs; as it contains an account of the Swediſh wool being greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in quality, as well as in quantity, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Spaniſh and Engliſh ſheep for breed. Now as France is an extenſive country, ſituated between Spain and England, two excellent wool-countries, it would be ſtrange, if there ſhould not be found a ſingle corner in all France, where wool may be advanced to ſome degree of perfection. Britain may be juſtly apprehenfive of theſe attempts; for if France can cope with us under the diſadvantage of procuring our wool by ſmuggling, how far will they exceed us with good wool of their own? The wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len cloth of England has always been held its capital manufacture; and patriotiſm calls on every one to prevent if poſſible the loſs of that valuable branch. Till ſomething better be diſcovered, I venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what at firſt may be thought a ſtrange meaſure, and that is, to permit the exportation of our wool upon a moderate duty, ſuch as will raiſe the price to the French, but not ſuch as to encourage ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling. The opportunity of procuring wool in the neighbourhood at a moderate price, joined with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral unſucceſsful attempts to improve the ſtaple of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0032300302:301"/>
their own wool, would ſoon make the French aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thoughts of that improvement.</p>
                  <p>Experience has unfolded the advantages of liberty to export corn: it has greatly encouraged agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and, by increaſing the quantity of corn, has made it even cheaper at home than formerly. Have we not reaſon to expect a ſimilar conſequence, from the ſame meaſure with reſpect to wool? A new vent for that commodity would increaſe the number of our ſheep, meliorate the land by their dung, and probably bring down the price of our wool at home. It is proper indeed to prohibit the exportation of wool, as of corn, when the price riſes above a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſum; which would have the double effect of ſecuring plenty to ourſelves, and diſtreſſing our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals at critical times when the commodity is ſcarce.</p>
                  <p>There is one reaſon that ſhould influence our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to permit the exportation of wool, even ſuppoſing the foregoing arguments to be inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: Very long experience may teach us, if we can be taught by experience, that vain are our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent wool from being exported: it holds true with reſpect to all prohibitions, that ſmuggling will always prevail, where the profits riſe above the riſk. Why not then make a virtue of neceſſity, by permitting exportation under a duty? One other meaſure would reſtore the Engliſh wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len manufacture to its priſtine ſplendor, which is, to apply the ſum ariſing from the tax as a premium for exporting woollen goods. Were that meaſure adopted, the liberty of exporting wool would prove a ſingular bleſſing to England.</p>
                  <p>I cloſe this branch with a commercial leſſon, to which every other conſideration ought to yield. The trade of a nation depends for the moſt part on very delicate circumſtances, and requires to be carefully nurſed. Foreigners, in particular, ought to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and encouraged, that they may prefer us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0032300302:302"/>
others. Nor ought we ever to rely entirely on our natural advantages; for it is not eaſy to foreſee what may occur to overbalance them. As this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection is no leſs obvious than weighty, facts will be more effectual than argument for making a deep impreſſion. The Swiſs ſome years ago imported all their wines from the King of Sardinia's dominions. The King laid a high duty on theſe wines, knowing that the Swiſs had not ready acceſs to any other wine-country. He did not foreſee, that this high duty was equal to a premium for cultivating the vine at home. They ſucceeded; and now are provided with wine of their own growth. The city of Lyons, by making ſilver-thread in perfection, had maintained a monopoly of that article againſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, as well as natives. But a high duty on the exporting it, in order to monopolize alſo the manufacture of ſilver-lace, will probably excite fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to improve their own ſilver-thread and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-lace; and France will be deprived of both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies, by the very means employed for ſecuring both. Engliſh goods purchaſed by Spaniards for the American market, pay to the King of Spain on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation a duty equal to their value. This impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic meaſure opens a wide door to ſmuggling; as Engliſh goods can be furniſhed 50 per cent. cheaper from Jamaica. The Spaniſh governor of Mexico joins underhand in the ſmuggling; which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly carried on in the following manner. The governor, to whom early notice is given, iſſues a proclamation, bearing, that a foreign ſhip, with Engliſh goods on board, every article being ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is hovering on the coaſt; and prohibiting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſevere penalties, any perſon to be a purchaſer. That public proclamation, which is virtually a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic advertiſement, has the deſired effect. All flock to the ſhore, and purchaſe in perfect tranquillity.</p>

                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:0032300302:303"/>
Beſide heavy duties, commerce with foreigners has been diſtreſſed by many unwary regulations. The herring-fiſhery, which is now an immenſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of commerce, was engroſſed originally by the Scots. But graſping at all advantages, the royal boroughs of Scotland, in the reign of the ſecond James, prohibited their fiſhermen to ſell herrings at ſea to foreigners; ordering, that the herring ſhould be firſt landed, in order that they themſelves might be firſt ſerved. Such was the police of thoſe times. But behold the conſequence. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders, and people of the Hanſe towns, being prohibited to purchaſe as formerly, became fiſhers themſelves, and cut the Scots out of that profitable branch of trade. The tar-company of Sweden, taking it for granted, that the Engliſh could not otherwiſe be ſupplied, refuſed to let them have any pitch or tar, even for ready money, unleſs permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be imported into England in Swediſh bottoms; and conſequently in ſuch quantities only as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be pleaſed to furniſh. This hardſhip moved the parliament to give a bounty for pitch and tar made in our own colonies. And if we be not already, we ſhall ſoon be altogether independent of Sweden. The Dutch, excited by the profitable trade of Portugal with the Eaſt Indies, attempted a north-eaſt paſſage to China; and that proving abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, they ſet on foot a trade with Liſbon for Eaſt-India commodities. Portugal was at that time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King of Spain; and the Dutch, though at war with Spain, did not doubt of their being well received in Portugal, with which kingdom they had no cauſe to quarrel. But the King of Spain, overlooking not only the law of nations, but even his own intereſt as King of Portugal, confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated at ſhort-hand the Dutch ſhips and their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, in the harbour of Liſbon. That unjuſt and unpolitic treatment provoked the Dutch to attempt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0032300302:304"/>
an Eaſt-India trade, which probably they would not otherwiſe have thought of; and they were ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, as to ſupplant the Portugueſe in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thus the King of Spain, by a groſs error in politics, exalted his enemies to be a powerful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime ſtate. Had he encouraged the Dutch to trade with Liſbon, other nations muſt have reſorted to the ſame market. Portugal thereby would have been raiſed to ſuch a height of maritime power, as to be afraid of no rival. The Dutch would not have thought of coping with them, nor would any other nation.</p>
                  <p>We proceed to foreign commodities, and the meaſures laid down for regulating their importation, which have different views. One is, to keep down a rival power; in which view it is prudent to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit importation from one country, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it from another. It is judicious in the Britiſh legiſlature, to load French wines with a higher duty than thoſe of Portugal; and in France, it would be a proper meaſure, to prefer the beef of Holſtein, or of Ruſſia, before that of Ireland; and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco of the Ukraine, or of the Palatinate, before that of Virginia. But ſuch meaſures of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be ſparingly exerciſed, for fear of retaliation.</p>
                  <p>There is no cauſe more cogent for regulating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, than an unfavourable balance. By per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting French goods to be imported free of duty, the balance againſt England was computed to be a million Sterling yearly. In the year 1678, that importation was regulated; which, with a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wearing Eaſt-India manufactures, did in twenty years turn the balance of trade in favour of England.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the Britiſh regulations with regard to goods imported, are contrived for promoting our own manufactures, or thoſe of our colonies. A ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,

3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Edward IV. cap. 4. intitled, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Certain merchandiſes not lawful to be brought ready wrought into the kingdom,"</q> contains a large liſt of ſuch merchandiſes; ſhowing the good ſenſe of the Engliſh in an early period, intent on promoting their own manufactures. To favour a new manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of our own, it is proper to lay a duty on the ſame manufacture imported. To encourage the art of throwing ſilk, the duty on raw ſilk imported is reduced, and that on thrown ſilk is heightened. But ſuch a meaſure ought to be taken with great circumſpection, leſt it recoil againſt ourſelves. The Swedes, ſome years ago, intent on raiſing manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures at home, prohibited at once foreign manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, without due preparation. Smuggling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, for people muſt import what they cannot find at home; and the home manufactures were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited. But the conſequences were ſtill more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. Foreign manufactures were formerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with their copper, iron, timber, pitch, tar, &amp;c.: but now, as foreigners cannot procure theſe commodities but with ready money, they reſort to Ruſſia and Norway, where commodities of the ſame kind are procured by barter. The Swediſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perceiving their error, permit ſeveral foreign manufactures to be imported as formerly. But it is now too late; for the trade flows into another chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; and at preſent, the Swediſh copper and iron works are far from flouriſhing as they once did. In the year 1768, an ordinance was iſſued by the court of Spain, prohibiting printed or painted linen and cotton to be imported; intended for encouraging a manufacture of printed cottons projected in Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Aragon. The Spaniſh miniſtry have all along been ſingularly unlucky in their commercial regulations. It is eaſy to foreſee, that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition will have no effect, but to raiſe the price on the ſubjects of Spain; for the prohibited goods
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0032300302:306"/>
will be ſmuggled, diſcouraging as much as ever the intended manufacture. The prudent meaſure would have been, to lay a duty upon printed cottons and linens imported, ſo ſmall as not to encourage ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling; and to apply that duty for nurſing the infant manufacture. A foreign manufacture ought never to be totally prohibited, till that at home be in ſuch plenty, as nearly to ſupply the wants of the natives. During ignorance of political principles, a new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture was commonly encouraged with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive privilege for a certain number of years. Thus in Scotland, an excluſive privilege of export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woollen and linen manufactures, was given to ſome private ſocieties<note n="c" place="bottom">Act 42. parl. 1661.</note>. Such a monopoly is rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to a nation; and frequently to the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf<note n="d" place="bottom">See Elements du Commerce, tom. 1. p. 334.</note>. I know no monopoly that in ſound politics can be juſtified, except that given to authors of books for fourteen years by an act of Queen Anne<note n="*" place="bottom">That act is judiciouſly contrived, not only for the benefit of authors, but for that of learning in general. It encourages men of genius to write, and multiplies books both of inſtruction and amuſement; which, by concurrence of many editors after the monopoly is at an end, are ſold at the cheapeſt rate. Many well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perſons complain, that the excluſive privilege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by the ſtatute upon authors is too ſhort, and that it ought to be perpetual. Nay, it is aſſerted, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have a perpetual privilege by common law; and it was determined lately in the court of king's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bench, that by the common law of England the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is perpetual. Nothing more frequently happens, than by graſping at the ſhadow, to loſe the ſubſtance; for I have no difficulty to maintain that a perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of books would prove more deſtructive to learning, and even to authors, than a ſecond irruption of Goths and Vandals. It is the nature of monopoly to raiſe the price of commodities; and by a perpetual monopoly in the commerce of books, the price of good books would be raiſed far beyond the reach of moſt readers: they would be ſold like pictures of the great maſters. The works of Shakeſpeare, for example, or of Milton, would be ſeen in very few libraries. In ſhort, the ſale of good books would be confined to a few learned men, ſuch as have money to ſpare, and to a few rich men, who buy out of vanity, as they buy a diamond or a fine coat. Faſhions at the ſame time are variable; and books, even the moſt ſplendid, would wear out of faſhion with men of opulence, and be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed as antiquated furniture. And with reſpect to men of taſte, their number is ſo ſmall as not to afford encouragement even for the moſtfrugal edition. Thus bookſellers, by graſping too much, would put an end to their trade altogether; and men of genius would not write, when no price could be afforded for their works. At the ſame time, our preſent authors and bookſellers would not be much benefited by ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly. Not many books have ſo long a run as four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years; and the ſucceſs of a book on the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication is ſo uncertain, that a bookſeller will give lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more for a perpetuity, than for the temporary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the ſtatute. This was foreſeen by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature; and the privilege was wiſely conſined to fourteen years, equally beneficial to the public and to authors.</note>. Exemption from duty, premiums to the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0032300302:307"/>
beſt workmen, a bounty on exportation, joined with a duty on goods of the ſame kind imported, and at laſt a total prohibition, are the proper encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a new manufacture.</p>
                  <p>The importation of raw materials ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in every manufacturing country, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only a moderate duty for encouraging our own rude materials of the ſame kind. By a French edict 1654, for encouraging ſhip-building, ſhip-timber imported pays no duty. But perhaps a moderate
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0032300302:308"/>
duty would have been better policy, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch timber of the growth of France. Deal timber accordingly, and other timber, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Britain from any part of Europe, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land excepted, pays a moderate duty. And oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark imported pays a duty, which is an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to propagate oak at home. The importation of lean cattle from Ireland, which in effect are raw materials, is, by a ſtatute of Charles II. declared a public nuiſance. What groſs ignorance! Is it not evident, that to feed cattle, is more profitable than to breed them? The chief promoter of that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtatute, was Sir John Knight, infamous for an inſolent ſpeech in King William's reign againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalizing foreign Proteſtants, and propoſing to kick out of the kingdom thoſe already ſettled. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath proved the benefit of importing lean cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into England; witneſs the vaſt quantities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported yearly from Scotland. Diamonds, pearls, and jewels of every kind, paid formerly upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation a duty of ten per cent. ad valorem; which by act 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi> George II. cap. 7. was taken off, upon the following preamble: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That London is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great mart for diamonds and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, from whence moſt foreign countries are ſupplied; that great numbers of rough dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds are ſent here to be cut and poliſhed; and that a free importation would encreaſe the trade."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sorry am I to obſerve, that ſeveral of our duties on importation, are far from being conformable to the foregoing rule; many raw materials neceſſary for our manufactures being loaded with a duty on importation, and ſome with a heavy duty. Barilla, for example, is a raw material uſed in the glaſs-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture: the exportation from Spain is loaded with a very high duty: and to raiſe the price ſtill higher, we add another duty on importation; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0032300302:309"/>
having the pretext of encouraging a raw mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of our own growth, for barilla grows not in this iſland. Hair is a raw material employed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral manufactures; and yet every kind of it, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hair, horſe hair, goat's hair, &amp;c. pays a duty on importation; which conſequently raiſes the price of our own hair, as well as of what is imported. Nor has this duty, more than the former, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of being an encouragement to our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; for ſurely there will not on that account be reared one child more, or foal, or kid. The ſame objection lies againſt the duty on foreign kelp, which is very high. Rancid oil of olives, fit for ſoap and woollen manufactures, pays upon importation a high duty: were it free of duty, we ſhould be able to ſerve ourſelves with Caſtile ſoap of home manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture; and likewiſe our colonies, which are partly ſupplied by the French. Each of the following raw materials ought in ſound policy to be free of duty on importation; and yet they are loaded with a duty, ſome with a high duty; pot-aſhes, elephant's teeth, raw ſilk from the Eaſt Indies, lamp-black, briſtles dreſſed or undreſſed, horns of beeves. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed ſkins, though a rude material, pay a duty on importation; and French kid-ſkins are honoured above others with a high duty: to reject a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to ourſelves rather than afford a ſmall benefit to a rival nation, ſavours more of peeviſhneſs than of prudence.</p>
                  <p>For encouraging our colonies, coffee is permitted to be imported from the plantations free of duty, while other coffee pays ſix pence per pound. The heavy duty on whalebone and whale-oil imported, which was laid on for encouraging our own whale-fiſhing, is taken off with reſpect to the importation from our American colonies<note n="e" place="bottom">A George III. cap. 29.</note>. This may put an
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0032300302:310"/>
end to our own whale-fiſhery: but it will enable the Americans to cope with the Dutch; and who knows whether they may not at laſt prevail? For encouraging the culture of hemp and flax in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, there is a bounty given upon what is imported into Britain. One would imagine, that our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intended to enable the colonies to rival us in a ſtaple manufacture, contrary to the fundamental principle of colonization. But we did not ſee ſo far: we only foreſaw a benefit to Britain, in being ſupplied with hemp and flax from our colonies, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than from Ruſſia and the Low Countries. But even abſtracting from rivalſhip, was it not obvious, that a bounty for encouraging the culture of hemp and flax at home, would be more ſucceſsful, than for encouraging the culture in America, where the price of labour is exceſſively high, not to talk of the freight<note n="*" place="bottom">Between the mother-country and her colonies the following rule ought to be ſacred, That with reſpect to commodities wanted, each of them ſhould prefer the other before all other nations. Britain ſhould take from her colonies whatever they can furniſh for her uſe; and they ſhould take from Britain whatever ſhe can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for their uſe. In a word, every thing regarding commerce ought to be reciprocal, and equal between them. To bar a colony from acceſs to the fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head for commodities that cannot be furniſhed by the mother-country but at ſecond-hand, is oppreſſion: it is ſo far degrading the coloniſts from being free ſubjects to be ſlaves. What right, for example, has Britain to prohibit her colonies from purchaſing tea or porcelane at Canton, if they can procure it cheaper there than in London? No connection between two nations can be ſo intimate, as to make ſuch reſtraint an act of juſtice. Our legiſlature however have acted like a ſtep-mother to her American colonies. by prohibiting them to have any commerce but with Britain only. They muſt land firſt in Britain all their commodities, even what are not intended to be ſold there; and they muſt take from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not only its own product, but every foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity that is wanted. This regulation is not only unjuſt but impolitic; as by it the intereſt of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in general is ſacrificed to that of a few London merchants. Our legiſlature have at laſt ſo far opened their eyes, as to give a partial relief. Some articles are permitted to be carried directly to the place of deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without being firſt entered in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The encouragement given to foreign linen-yarn, by taking off the duty on importation, is a meaſure that greatly concerns Britain; and how far ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be ſtrictly examined, after ſtating ſome preliminary obſervations. The firſt is, That as the price of our own commodities can never riſe above that of foreign commodities ſold here, the price of imported linen muſt regulate the price of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made linen. The next is, That though the duty on importation is paid by the merchant at the firſt inſtance, he relieves himſelf of it, by raiſing the price on the purchaſer; which of courſe raiſes the price of the ſame ſort of goods made at home; and accordingly a duty on importation is in effect a bounty to our own manufacturers. A third obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That the price of our linen-cloth ought to be divided between the ſpinner and the weaver, in ſuch proportion as to afford bread to both. If the yarn be too high, the weaver is undone; and if too low, the ſpinner is undone. This was not attended to, when, for encouraging our ſpinners, a duty of three pence was laid on every pound of imported linen-yarn; which had the effect to raiſe the price of our own yarn beyond what the weaver could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. This myſtery being unveiled, the duty was firſt lowered to two pence, and then to a penny: our ſpinners had tolerable bread, and our weavers
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0032300302:312"/>
were not oppreſſed with paying too high a price for yarn.</p>
                  <p>Some patriotic gentlemen, who had more zeal than knowledge, finding the linen-manufacture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the ſeveral reductions of the duty, raſhly concluded, that it would be ſtill more benefited by a total abolition of the duty. The penny ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was taken off<note n="f" place="bottom">29 George II.</note>, and linen-yarn was permitted to be imported duty free; which, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had continued as at the date of the act, would have left us not a ſingle ſpinner by profeſſion; becauſe it would have reduced the price of our yarn below what could afford bread to the ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Lucky it has been for our linen-manufacture, that the German war, which ſoon followed, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended all their manufactures, and ſpinning in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; which proved a favourable opportunity for diffuſing widely the art of ſpinning, and for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſpinners more and more dexterous. And yet, now that the war is at an end, it is far from being certain, that our yarn can be afforded as cheap as what is imported from Sileſia. We have good authority for aſſerting, that the Engliſh ſpinners have ſuffered by that ſtatute: from the books of many pariſhes it appears, that ſoon after the ſtatute, a number of women, who had lived by ſpinning, became a burden upon the pariſh. One thing is evident, that as ſpinning is the occupation of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males who cannot otherwiſe be ſo uſefully employ'd, and as more hands are required for ſpinning than for weaving, the former is the more valuable branch of the manufacture. It ought then to be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar concern of our legiſlature, not to deſtroy that branch by impolitic regulations. And yet very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attention ſeems to have been given to the public
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0032300302:313"/>
intereſt, in paſſing the act under conſideration. Why was it not enquired into, whether the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reduction of the price of yarn would leave bread to the Britiſh ſpinner? The reſult of that enquiry would have been fatal to the intended act; for it would have been clearly ſeen, that the Scotch ſpinner could not make bread by her work, far leſs the Engliſh. Other particulars ought alſo to have been ſuggeſted to the legiſlature, that flax-ſpinning is of all occupations the fitteſt for women of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain claſs, confined within ſmall houſes; that a flax-wheel requires leſs ſpace than a wheel for wool; and that the toughneſs of Britiſh flax makes it excel for ſail-cloth, dowlas, ticking, and ſheeting. The Britiſh ſpinner might, in a Britiſh ſtatute, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the caſt of the ſcale, had it been but a half-penny per pound on importation.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, why ſhould there be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency in our commercial regulations, when the wiſeſt heads of the nation are employed about them? Flax, rough or undreſſed, being a rude ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, is imported duty-free, but dreſſed flax pays a high duty; both of them calculated for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging our own manufacturers. Behold now a flat inconſiſtency: though dreſſed flax, for the reaſon given, pays a high duty; yet when by additional labour it is converted into yarn, it pays no duty. How abſurd is this! Further, foreign yarn is not only made welcome duty-free, but even receives a bounty when converted into linen, and exported to our plantations. Have we no reaſon to be afraid, that ſuch indulgence to foreign yarn will deprive us of foreign rough flax? The difference of bulk and freight will determine the Germans to ſend us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their yarn, and equally determine our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters to commiſſion that commodity only.</p>
                  <p>Goods imported, if ſubjected to a duty, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of the beſt kind; becauſe the duty bears a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0032300302:314"/>
leſs proportion to ſuch than to meaner ſorts. The beſt French wines are imported into Britain, where the duty is higher than in any other country. For that reaſon, the beſt linen-yarn was imported while the duty ſubſiſted; but now the German yarn is ſorted into different kinds, of which the worſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Engliſh market.</p>
                  <p>Regulations concerning the exportation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities formerly imported, come next in order. And for encouraging ſuch exportation, one method practiſed with ſucceſs, is, to reſtore to the merchant the whole or part of the duty paid at importation; which is termed a drawback. This in particular is done with reſpect to tobacco; which by that means can be afforded to foreigners at two pence halfpenny per pound, when the price at home is eight pence halfpenny. But by an omiſſion in the act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a drawback is only given for raw tobacco; which bars the exportation of ſnuff or manufactured tobacco, as foreigners can underſell us five-and-thirty per cent. Tobacco being an article of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it was well judged in our legiſlature to lay a heavier duty on what is conſumed at home, than on what is exported. Upon the ſame principle, the duty that is paid on the importation of coffee and cocoa from our American plantations, is wholly drawn back when exported<note n="g" place="bottom">7 George III. cap. 46.</note>. But as China earthen ware is not intitled to any encouragement from us, and as it is an article of luxury, it gets no drawback, even when exported to America (7 George III. cap. 46.) The exporter of rice from Britain, firſt imported from America, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to draw back but half the duty paid on impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Rice imported duty-free might rival our wheat-crop. But the whole duty ought to be drawn back on exportation: it ought to be afforded to our
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0032300302:315"/>
neighbours at the loweſt rate, partly to rival their wheat-crop, and partly to encourage our rice-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</p>
                  <p>Tobacco is an article of luxury; and it is well ordered, that it ſhould come dearer to us than to foreigners. But every wiſe adminiſtration will take the oppoſite ſide with reſpect to articles that concern our manufactures. Quickſilver pays upon impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation a duty of about 8 d. per pound; 7 d. of which is drawn back upon exportation. The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the drawback was to encourage the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of quickſilver; without adverting, that to afford quickſilver to foreign manufacturers cheaper than to our own, is a groſs blunder in commercial politics. Again, when quickſilver is manufactured into vermilion or ſublimate, no drawback is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which effectually bars their exportation: we ought to be aſhamed of ſuch an abſurdity. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, dyers were prohibited to uſe logwood, which was ordered to be openly burnt. But the Engliſh dyers having acquired the art of fixing colours made of logwood, it was permitted to be imported<note n="h" place="bottom">Act 13 &amp; 14 Charles II. cap. 11. § 26, 27.</note>, every ton paying on importation L. 5; L. 4. of which was to be drawn back upon exportation. That law, made in the days of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, was intended to encourage the commerce of logwood; and had that effect: but the blunder of diſcouraging our own manufactures, by furniſhing logwood cheaper to our rivals, was overlooked. Both articles were put upon a better footing<note n="i" place="bottom">Act 8 George I. c. 14.</note>, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater encouragement to the commerce of logwood, by allowing it to be imported duty-free; and by giving an advantage to our own manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by laying a duty of 40 s. upon every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight exported. Laſtly, Still more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0032300302:316"/>
the commerce of logwood<note n="k" place="bottom">7 George III. cap. 47.</note>, the duty upon exportation is diſcontinued. It will have the effect propoſed: but will not that benefit be more than balanced by the encouragement it gives to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign manufactures? By the late peace, we have obtained the monopoly of gum-ſenega; and proper meaſures have been taken for turning it to the beſt account: the exportation from Africa is confined to Great Britain; and the duty on importation is only ſix pence per hundred weight: but the duty on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation from Britain is thirty ſhillings per hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight<note n="l" place="bottom">5 George III. cap. 37.</note>; which, with freight, commiſſion, and inſurance, makes it come dear to foreigners. Formerly, every beaver's ſkin paid upon importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeven pence of duty; and the exporter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a drawback of four pence; as if it had been the purpoſe of the legiſlature, to make our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pay more for that uſeful commodity than foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Upon obtaining a monopoly of beaver-ſkins by the late peace, that abſurd regulation was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: a penny per ſkin of duty is laid on importation, and ſeven pence on exportation<note n="m" place="bottom">4 George III. cap. 9.</note>. By that means beaver-ſkins are cheaper here than in any other country of Europe. A ſimilar regulation is eſtabliſhed with reſpect to gum-arabic. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight pays on importation ſix pence, and on exportation L. 1, 10 s.<note n="n" place="bottom">5 George III. cap. 37.</note>. As the foregoing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are uſed in various manufactures, their cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Britain, by means of theſe regulations, will probably balance the high price of labour, ſo as to keep open to us the foreign market.</p>
                  <p>James I. of England iſſued a proclamation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting gold and ſilver, whether in coin or plate,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0032300302:317"/>
goldſmith's work, or bullion, to be exported. Not to mention the unconſtitutional ſtep of an Engliſh King uſurping the legiſlative power, it was a glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſurity to prohibit manufactured work from being exported. Gold and ſilver, coined or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coined, are to this day prohibited from being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from France; a moſt abſurd prohibition, for a merchant will never willingly export gold and ſilver; but if the balance be againſt him, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation is unavoidable. The only effect of the prohibition is, to ſwell the merchant's debt; for he muſt have recourſe to a ſmuggler, who muſt be tempted with a high bribe to undertake the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</p>
                  <p>A French author remarks, that in no country are commercial regulations better contrived than in Britain; and inſtances the following particulars: 1ſt, Foreign commodities, ſuch as may rival their own, are prohibited, or burdened with duties. 2d, Their manufactures are encouraged by a free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation. 3d, Raw materials, which cannot be produced at home, cochineal, for example, indigo, &amp;c. are imported free of duty. 4th, Raw mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of their own growth, ſuch as wool, ſuller's-earth, &amp;c. are prohibited to be exported. 5th, Every commodity has a free courſe through the kingdom, without duty. And laſtly, Duties paid on importation, are repaid on exportation. This remark is for the moſt part well ſounded; and yet the facts above ſet forth will not permit us to ſay, that the Engliſh commercial laws have as yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at perfection.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus gone through the ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that enter into the preſent ſketch, I ſhall cloſe with ſome general reflections. The management of the finances is a moſt important branch of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0032300302:318"/>
and no leſs delicate than important. Taxes may be ſo contrived as to promote in a high degree the proſperity of a ſtate; and without much contrivance, they may do much miſchief. The latter, by rendering the ſovereign odious, and the people miſerable, effectually eradicate patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: no other cauſe is more fruitful of rebellion; and no other cauſe reduces a country to be a more eaſy prey to an invader. To that cauſe were the Mahomerans chiefly indebted for their conqueſt of the Greek empire. The people were glad to change their maſter; becauſe, inſtead of multiplied, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and vexatious duties, they found themſelves ſubjected to a ſimple tribute, eaſily collected, and eaſily paid. Had the art of oppreſſive taxes been known to the Romans, when they put in practice againſt the Carthaginians the utmoſt perfidy and cruelty, for making them abandon their city, they probably would have choſen the ſofter method of impoſing high duties on exportation and importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would have gratified their avarice, and at the ſame time have emaciated Carthage, and reduced it to beggary.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch taxes require not the aid of external force to ſubdue a nation: they alone will reduce it to the moſt contemptible weakneſs. From the union of the different Spaniſh kingdoms under one monarch, there was reaſon to expect an exertion of ſpirit, ſimilar to that of the Romans, when peace was reſtored under Auguſtus. Spain was at that period the moſt potent kingdom in Europe, or perhaps in the world; and yet, inſtead of flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that advantageous condition, it was, by noxious taxes, brought down to poverty and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. The political hiſtory of that kingdom, with reſpect to its finances, ought to be kept in perpetual remembrance, that kings and their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0032300302:319"/>
may ſhun the deſtructive rock upon which Spain hath been wrecked. The cortes of Spain had once as extenſive powers as ever were enjoyed by an Engliſh parliament; but at the time of their union, their power being ſunk to a ſhadow, the King and his miniſters governed without much control. Britain cannot be too thankful to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for her parliament. From the hiſtory of every modern European nation, an inſtructive leſſon may be gathered, that the three eſtates, or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in our language, are the only proper check againſt the ignorance and rapacity of miniſters. The fertility of the Spaniſh ſoil is well known. Notwithſtanding frequent droughts to which it is liable, it would produce greatly with diligent cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and in fact, during the time of the Roman domination, produced corn ſufficient for its nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inhabitants, and a great ſurplus, which was annually exported to Italy. During the domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moors, Arabian authors agree, that Spain was extremely populous. An author of that nation, who wrote in the tenth century, reports, that in his time there were in Spain 80 capital cities, 300 of the ſecond and third orders, beſide villages ſo frequent, that one could not walk a mile without meeting one or more of them. In Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dova alone, the capital of the Mooriſh empire, he reckons 200,000 houſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Dwelling-houſes, at that time, were not ſo large, nor ſo expenſive, as they came to be in later times.</note>, 600 moſques, and 900 public baths. In the eleventh century, another author mentions no fewer than 12,000 villages in the plain of Seville. Agriculture at that period muſt have been in the utmoſt perfection, when Spain could feed ſuch multitudes. What was the extent of their internal commerce is not recorded;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0032300302:320"/>
but all authors agree, that their foreign commerce was immenſe. Beſide many articles of ſmaller va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, they exported raw ſilk, oil, ſugar, a ſort of cochineal, quickſilver, iron, wrought and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought manufactures of ſilk, of wool, &amp;c. The annual revenue of Abdoulraham III. one of the Spaniſh Caliphs, was, in money, 12,145,000 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares, above five millions Sterling, beſide large quantities of corn, wine, oil, and other fruits. That prince's revenue muſt indeed have been immenſe, to ſupply the ſums expended by him. Beſide the annual charges of government, fleets, and armies, he laid out great ſums on his private pleaſures. Though engaged continually in war, he had money to ſpare for building a new town three miles from Cordova, named Zehra, after his favourite miſtreſs. In that town he erected a magnificent palace, ſufficiently capacious for his whole ſeraglio of ſix thouſand three hundred perſons. There were in it fourteen hundred columns of African and Spaniſh marble, nineteen of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian marble, and one hundred and forty of the fineſt kind, a preſent from the Greek Emperor. In the middle of the great ſaloon were many images of birds and beaſts in pure gold, adorned with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, pouring water into a large marble baſon. That prince muſt have had immenſe ſtables for horſes, when he entertained, for his conſtant guard, no fewer than twelve thouſand horſemen, having ſabres and belts enriched with gold. Upon the city of Zehra alone, including the palace and gardens, were expended annually three hundred thouſand dinares, which make above one hundred thouſand pounds Sterling; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired twenty-five years to complete theſe works<note n="*" place="bottom">A preſent made to Abdoulrahman by Abdoulme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik, when choſen prime vizir, is a ſpecimen of the riches of Spain in that period. 1ſt, 408 pounds of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin gold. 2d, The value of 420,000 ſequins in ſilver ingots. 3d, 400 pounds of the wood of aloes, one piece of which weighed 180 pounds. 4th, 500 ounces of ambergreaſe, of which there was one piece that weighed 100 ounces. 5th, 300 ounces of the fineſt camphire. 6th, 300 pieces of gold-ſtuff, ſuch as were prohibited to be worn but by the Caliph himſelf. 7th, A quantity of fine fur. 8th, Horſe-furniture of gold and ſilk, Bagdad fabric, for 48 horſes. 9th, 4000 pounds of raw ſilk. 10th, 30 pieces of Perſian tapeſtry of ſurpriſing beauty. 11th, Complete armour for 800 war-horſes. 12th, 1000 bucklers, and 100,000 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. 13th, Fifteen Arabian horſes, with moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous furniture; and one hundred other Arabian horſes for the King's attendants. 14th, Twenty mules, with ſuitable furniture. 15th, Forty young men, and twenty young women, complete beauties, all of them dreſſed in ſuperb habits.</note>.</p>

The great fertility of the ſoil, the induſtry of the Moors, and their advantageous ſituation for trade, carried on the proſperity of Spain down to the time that they were ſubdued by Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand of Arragon. Of this we have undoubted evidence, from the condition of Spain in the days of Charles V. and of his ſon Philip, being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that period the richeſt nation in the univerſe. We have the authority of Uſtariz, that the town of Seville, in the period mentioned, contained ſixty thouſand ſilk looms. During the ſixteenth century, the woollen cloth of Segovia was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fineſt in Europe; and that of Caralonia long maintained its preference in the Levant, in Italy, and in the adjacent iſlands. In a memorial addreſſed to the ſecond Philp, Louis Valle de la Cerda reports, that in the fair of Medina he had negotiated bills of exchange to the extent of one
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0032300302:322"/>
hundred and fifty-five millions of crowns; and in Spain, at that time, there were ſeveral other fairs no leſs frequented.</p>
                  <p>The expulſion of the Moors deprived Spain of ſix or ſeven hundred thouſand frugal and induſtrious inhabitants; a wound that touched its vitals, but not mortal: tender care, with proper remedies, would have reſtored Spain to its former vigour. But unhappily for that kingdom, its political phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians were not ſkilled in the method of cure: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of applying healing medicines, they inflamed the diſeaſe, and rendered it incurable. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, who, inſtigated by the clergy, had prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the King to baniſh the Moors, dreading loſs of favour if they ſhould ſuffer the King's revenues to ſink, were forced, in ſelf-defence, to double the taxes upon the remaining inhabitants. And what could be expected from that fatal meaſure, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruin; when the poor Chriſtians, who were too much of gentlemen to be induſtrious, had ſcarce been able to crawl under the load of former taxes?</p>
                  <p>But a matter that affords a leſſon ſo inſtructive merits a more particular detail. So late as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the laſt century, there were extenſive plantations of ſugar in the kingdom of Granada, which, upon the occaſion mentioned, were deeply taxed, ſo as that, with the former taxes, ſugar paid thirty-ſix per cent. This branch of huſbandry, which could not fail to languiſh under ſuch oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was in a deep conſumption when the firſt American ſugars were imported into Europe, and was totally extinguiſhed by the lower price of theſe ſugars. Spain once enjoyed a moſt extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of ſpirits manufactured at home, perhaps more extenſive than France does at preſent. But two cauſes concurred to ruin that manufacture; firſt, oppreſſive taxes; and next, a prohibition to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0032300302:323"/>
the manufacturer, of vending his ſpirits to any but to the farmers of the revenue; a ſlavery paſt all endurance. Spaniſh ſalt is ſuperior in quality to that of Portugal, and ſtill more to that of France: when refined in Holland, it produces 10 per cent. more than the former, and 20 per cent. more than the latter; and the making of ſalt requires in Spain leſs labour than in Portugal or in France. Thus Spaniſh ſalt may be afforded the cheapeſt, as requiring leſs labour; and yet may draw the higheſt price, as ſuperior in quality: notwithſtanding which ſhining advantages, ſcarce any ſalt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Spain; and no wonder, for an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant duty makes it come dearer to the purchaſer than any other ſalt. A more moderate duty would bring more profit to the government; beſide eaſing the labouring poor, and employing them in the manufacture. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uperior quality of Spaniſh raw ſilk makes it in great requeſt; but as the duty upon it exceeds 60 per cent. it can find no vent in a foreign market: nor is there almoſt any demand for it at home, as its high price has reduced the ſilk-manufacture in Spain to the loweſt ebb, But the greateſt oppreſſion of all, as it affects every ſort of manufacture, is the famous tax known by the name of alcavala, upon every thing bought and ſold, which was laid on in the fifteenth century by a cortes or parliament, limited expreſsly to eight years, and yet kept up, contrary to law, merely by the King's authority. This monſtrous tax, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally 10 per cent. ad valorem, was, by the two Philips III. and IV. augmented to 14 per cent.; ſufficient of itſelf to deſtroy all internal commerce, by the encouragement it gives to ſmuggling<note n="*" place="bottom">The following paſſage is from Uſtariz, ch. 96. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"After mature conſideration of the duties impoſed upon commodities, I have not diſcovered in France, England, or Holland, any duty laid upon the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale of their own manufactures, whether the firſt or any ſubſequent ſale. As Spain alone groans under the burden of 14 per cent. impoſed not only on the firſt ſale of every parcel, but on each ſale, I am jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that this ſtrange tax is the chief cauſe of the ruin of our manufactures."</q> As to the ruinous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this tax, ſee Bernardo de Ulloa upon the Manufactures and Commerce of Spain, Part 1. ch. 3. ch. 13. And yet ſo blind was Philip.II. of Spain, as to impoſe the alcavala upon the Netherlands, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try flouriſhing in commerce both internal and external. It muſt have given a violent ſhock to their manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.</note>. The
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0032300302:324"/>
difficulty of recovering payment of ſuch oppreſſive taxes heightened the brutality of the farmers; which haſtened the downfall of the manufactures: poverty and diſtreſs baniſhed ſuch workmen as could find bread elſewhere; and reduced the reſt to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary. The poor huſbandmen ſunk under the weight of taxes: and, as if this had not been ſufficient to ruin agriculture totally, the Spaniſh miniſtry ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added an abſolute prohibition againſt exporting corn. The moſt amazing article of all is, that it has been the practice, for more than three centuries, to ſet a price on corn; which ruins the farmer when the price is low, and yet refuſes him the relief of a high price. That agriculture in Spain ſhould be in a deep conſumption, is far from being a wonder: it is rather a wonder that it has not long ago died of that diſeaſe. Formerly there was plenty of corn for twenty millions of inhabitants, with a ſurplus for the great city of Rome; and yet at preſent, and for very many years back, there has not been corn for ſeven millions, its preſent inhabitants. Their only reſource for procuring even the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0032300302:325"/>
of life, were the treaſures of the new world, which could not laſt for ever; and Spain became ſo miſerably poor, that Philip IV. was neceſſitated to give a currency to his copper coin, almoſt equal to that of ſilver. Thus in Spain, the downfall of huſbandry, arts, and commerce, was not occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by expulſion of the Moors, and far leſs by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a new world<note n="*" place="bottom">Uſtariz in his Theory and Practice of Commerce, proves, from evident facts, that the depopulation of Spain is not occaſioned by the Weſt Indies. From Caſtile few go to America, and yet Caſtile is the worſt peopled country in Spain. The northern provinces, Gallicia, Aſturia, Biſcay, &amp;c. ſend more people to Mexico and Peru than all the other provinces; and yet of all are the moſt populous. He aſcribes the depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Spain to the ruin of the manufactures by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive taxes; and aſſerts, that the Weſt Indies tend rather to people Spain: many return home laden with riches; and of thoſe who do not return, many remit money to their relations, which enables them to marry, and to rear children.</note>, of which the gold and ſilver were favourable to huſbandry at leaſt; but by exorbitant taxes, a voracious monſter, which, after ſwallowing up the whole riches of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, has left nothing for itſelf to feed on. The following picture is drawn by a writer of that nation, who may be depended on for veracity as well as knowledge<note n="a" place="bottom">Don Gieronimo de Uſtariz.</note>. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Poverty and diſtreſs diſpeople a country, by baniſhing all thoughts of marriage. They even deſtroy ſucking children; for what nouriſhment can a woman afford to her infant, who herſelf is reduced to bread and water, and is overwhelmed with labour and deſpair? A greater proportion accordingly die here in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, than where the labouring poor are more at eaſe; and of thoſe who eſcape by ſtrength of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0032300302:326"/>
conſtitution, the ſcarcity of cloathing and of nouriſhment makes them commonly ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So blind however are the Spaniards in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of their finances, that the preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry are following out the ſame meaſures in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, that have brought their native country to the brink of ruin. Cochineal, cocoa, ſugar, &amp;c. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Spain duty-free, would be a vaſt fund of commerce with other nations: but a heavy duty on importation is an abſolute bar to that commerce, by forcing the other European nations to provide themſelves elſewhere. Spaniſh oil exported to America would be a great article of commerce, were it not barred by a heavy duty on exportation, equal almoſt to a prohibition: and the Spaniſh Americans, for want of oil, are reduced to uſe fat and butter, very improper for a hot climate. The prohibition of planting vines in Mexico, and the exceſſive duty on the importation of Spaniſh wines into that country, have introduced a ſpirit drawn from the ſugar-cane, which, being more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than a peſtilence, is prohibited under ſevere penalties. The prohibition, however, has no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but to give the governors of the provinces a monopoly of thoſe ſpirits, which, under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, are ſold publicly; a commerce no leſs ſhameful than deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>But this ſubject ſeems to be inexhauſtible. The ſilver and gold mines in the Spaniſh Weſt Indies are, by improper taxes, rendered leſs profitable, both to the King and to the proprietors, than they ought to be. The King's ſhare is the fifth part of the ſilver, and the tenth part of the gold, that the mines produce. There is beſide a duty of eighty piaſtres upon every quintal of mercury employed in theſe mines. Theſe heavy exactions, have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0032300302:327"/>
an abandon of all mines but what are of the richeſt ſort. The inhabitants pay 33 per cent. on the goods imported to them from Spain, and they are ſubjected beſide to the alcavala, which is 14 per cent. for every thing bought and ſold within the country. The moſt provoking tax of all is what is termed la cruciade, being a ſum paid for indulgence to eat eggs, butter, and cheeſe, during Lent, which is yielded by the Pope to the King of Spain. The government, it is true, obliges no perſon to take out ſuch an indulgence: but the prieſts refuſe every religious conſolation to thoſe who do not purchaſe; and there is not perhaps a ſingle perſon in Spaniſh America who is bold enough to ſtand out againſt ſuch oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>There is recorded in hiſtory another example of deſtructive taxes ſimilar to that now mentioned. Auguſtus, on his conqueſt of Egypt, having brought to Rome the treaſure of its kings, gold and ſilver overflowed in Italy; the bulk of which found its way to Conſtantinople, when it became the ſeat of empire. By theſe means, Italy was ſadly impoveriſhed: the whole ground had been covered with gardens and villas, now deſerted; and there was neither corn nor manufactures to exchange for money. Gold and ſilver became now as rare in Italy as they had been of old; and yet the ſame taxes that had been paid with eaſe during plenty of money, were rigidly exacted, which ruined all.</p>
