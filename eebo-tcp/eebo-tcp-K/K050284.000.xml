            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Certainly Men leſs converſant in Publick Affairs, who have a Zeal for your Government, would be of more Uſe and Service to you; Men who were perſecuted by King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> either in their own Perſons, or in the Perſons of their Friends, who were fin'd, impriſon'd, and ſome of their Relations hang'd in thoſe Reigns, are more likely to act in earneſt againſt King <hi>James,</hi> and in the ſupporting your Majeſty and your Government, than thoſe who had their Fortunes and their Families rais'd by King <hi>James</hi> and his Brother King <hi>Charles,</hi> and who hope to be rais'd yet more by his Return, or at leaſt to ſecure in his Government what they have got in this, by obliging him and his Friends, at the Price of ſacrificing you and your's.</p>
            <p>For Example: Is it reaſonable to believe the E. of <hi>N.</hi> whoſe Father and Family was rais'd by King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> for proſtituting the Law (and his nauſeous Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick) to the Deſigns of thoſe two Brothers, who himſelf was a Privy-Counſellor with Father <hi>Peters,</hi> and choſen by King <hi>James</hi> at the time of the Revolution to treat with your Majeſty at <hi>Hungerford,</hi> in order to delay your Progreſs to <hi>London</hi>; and laſtly, who ſo violently oppos'd your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's being crown'd King, as to lay an eternal Obligation upon King <hi>James</hi> by it: I ſay, Sir, is it reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Gentleman ſo proper a Secretary of State to your Majeſty, as the E. of <hi>S.</hi> who has ſo mortally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblig'd King <hi>James,</hi> in being ſo early, and ſo zealous in your Intereſts, who went at the Head of that Meſſage to King <hi>James</hi> wherein he was requir'd to retire from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>; who has ſince that been ſo inſtrumental to place and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0541201000:7"/>
preſerve the Crown upon your Head; and has, in a word, broken all Meaſures ſo with King <hi>James,</hi> as to leave no poſſibility of a Reconciliation to him, and conſequently has no Retreat from this Government, but is oblig'd in common Senſe to ſerve your Majeſty faithfully and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly?</p>
            <p>Or can your Majeſty think Mr. <hi>K.</hi> who (it is generally ſaid) believes himſelf the Son of King <hi>J.</hi> and it is known by all the World, owes his Fortune to him; who (if we may believe Report) at the time of the Revolution, agreed with Captain <hi>Toſyer,</hi> to carry the Ships he then commanded in the <hi>Straits</hi> to King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>France</hi> (had not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sailors very rudely oppos'd the Project) who after this acquitted himſelf ſo ill at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> in letting the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Squadron paſs by him in his ſight, without fighting them; and to conclude, has made ſo unaccountable a Campagn of it this Summer: Can your Majeſty (give me leave to ſay, Sir) think this Gentleman (after all this) fitter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Fleet of <hi>England,</hi> than Mr. <hi>R.</hi> whoſe Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to King <hi>James</hi> are never to be forgiven by him; who was one of the moſt inſtrumental Men in <hi>England</hi> in placing you upon the Throne; who laſt Year gave you the greateſt and moſt glorious Victory that ever was obtain'd by us at Sea; and whoſe Courage, Conduct and Fidelity the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England</hi> has unanimouſly atteſted?</p>
            <p>And now, Sir (if I may preſume ſo far) will your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty be pleas'd to examine what Honour, what Profit has accru'd to you, or the Nation, by your employing theſe Gentlemen who have of late been at the Head of the Miniſtry? For God's ſake, Sir, caſt up the Account of the laſt four Years Management, and ſee what you have gain'd by changing Whigs for Torys. Have not your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs gone backward both at home and abroad? Have not Miſmanagements been multiply'd? Have you not cool'd your Friends, and yet not gain'd your Enemies? Do not almoſt all the Tories you employ drink King <hi>James</hi>'s Health in your Wine, and ſerve him in your Offices? Do they not obſtruct all Buſineſs which ought to be diſpatch'd, and diſpatch all Buſineſs which ought to be obſtructed? brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat your Friends, and delay them in the moſt juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, but comply with your Enemies in their moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Demands; nay, connive at their Cabals and Conſpiracies, and ſnatch them out of the Hands of Juſtice, when the Law has ſentenc'd them to Death for their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Would not ſuch Miniſters and Friends as theſe be leſs dangerous to you, when profeſs'd Enemies, nay in Arms againſt you in the Field, than in your Council, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet and Offices? Undoubtedly they would.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0541201000:8"/>But I know the common Anſwer to all theſe kind of Complaints is, That it is more eaſy to find Faults than Remedies. If you pleaſe therefore, Sir, we will conſider of Remedys, and I think there may be ſome found out both eaſy and certain, and they are theſe: Firſt, Sir, be pleas'd to remove from your Perſon, Council and Offices of Truſt, Men bred up and confirm'd in Principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and hateful to your People; and to diſcountenance all State-Projecters, and Mountebank-Miniſters, who make Wounds in the State to recommend their Balſam: Throw out, Sir, theſe <hi>Achans</hi> to be ſton'd by the People, who will otherwiſe, I fear, prevent God's Favour to you; who blaſt your Succeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and rob you of the Affections of your Subjects at home, with their accurſed thing, I mean that Tinſel Power with which theſe Miſcreants dazle the Eyes of Princes, and lead them out of the right way. God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with it: For uncontroulable and unaccountable Power is the Right and Attribute of God alone; and (as the Scripture tells us) <hi>He will not give his Glory unto another; nor ſuffer thoſe to act like Gods, who are to die like Men.</hi> Your People alſo will be diſpleas'd with a Deſpotick Power; for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are bound by Laws, by mutual Compacts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as you your ſelf, Sir, have ſet forth moſt unanſwerably in your Declaration when you came over) and if theſe are broken, <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> who believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Subjects to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> (as by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd) and not Slaves to any particular Perſon<note n="*" place="margin">Otherwiſe King <hi>James</hi> would have a fairer Pretence, than I hope we ſhall ever allow him.</note>; they become impatient, angry, and at length perhaps unreaſonable. And whenever they ſee their King beſet with Miniſters of Lawleſs Principles (thoſe wholeſale Merchants of Arbitrary Power) they grow miſtruſtful and uneaſy, and are apt in ſuch Caſes to ſhut their Purſes, and open their Mouths. And give me leave to ſay, Sir, had not the People been made apprehenſive and jealous, by ſeeing theſe Men in the Miniſtry, whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Methods they were ſo well acquainted with, and did ſo much abhor; no general Exciſe, no Loans, no Powers would have been thought by the People of <hi>England,</hi> too much to have intruſted you with; ſo highly they eſteem'd your generous Relief of them, your unequal Courage, and the many other admirable Vertues they ſaw ſhine in you.

            <p>But, Sir, Purgatives will not alone perfect the Cure of your Government, and reſtore it to perfect Health; you muſt make uſe of Alteratives too, there muſt be a Change of Meaſures, as well as a Diſcharge of Men: And the Method I would humbly offer is this.</p>

If the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> think you have a favourable Opinion of them, they will endeavour to deſerve it; if not, they may perhaps deſerve your worſt Opinion too. This Humour of the Nation Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> found early, and apply'd her ſelf ſo happily to it, as by this ſingle Point to maſter all her Difficulties (the greateſt it may be that ever Prince had to ſtruggle with) whereas her Succeſſors, by contrary Meaſures, brought themſelves into very unfortunate Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Sir, let me deſire you to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your ſelf in Elections of Members in Parliament, or influencing them when choſen: the Parliament is a ſacred part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, and like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Ark of old, is not to be touch'd profanely, but with great Danger to thoſe who touch it ſo.

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had no pretending Rival to the Right of Stadtholder; but the King has here a Rival, a Father-in-Law, who pretends a Right to the Crown, who is ſupported by the greateſt Power that ever was known in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo as to make the Event appear doubtful, even to thoſe who are moſt zealous to this Government. And by this means the Friends of King <hi>James</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to be firm to his Intereſts, and Neutrals; nay, and even his fearful Enemies are frighted from acting with a Zeal againſt him. Is this a time then to be trying Experiments, to put our ſelves and our Affairs into the

No ſure, with my Lord <hi>N—</hi>'s leave, <hi>this is not the time.</hi> In this time of danger, thoſe who have been the antient and declar'd Enemies of King <hi>James,</hi> and who have moſt reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect being hang'd if he return, are moſt fit for the King to rely on. But when theſe Difficulties are maſter'd, as much Comprehenſion as you pleaſe. In the mean time your Education in <hi>Toryiſm,</hi> your Obligations to King <hi>James,</hi> and, which is more than both, your preſent Hopes from him, will make you ſo averſe to this Government, that no Favour, no Courtſhip can engage you heartily in its Intereſts; and it is nonſenſe to expect you ſhould fight for a Title you have always declar'd to diſapprove of.</p>
