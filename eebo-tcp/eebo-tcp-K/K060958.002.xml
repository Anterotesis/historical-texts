            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0201000402:4"/>
of the City. <hi>Calis,</hi> or <hi>Calais,</hi> is a very ſtrong Town in the Province of <hi>Picardy</hi>; tho' I think not ſtrong enough to be call'd, as it is, one of the Keys of <hi>France.</hi> It is, as near as I cou'd gueſs, a little bigger than <hi>Dover,</hi> but more populous. It wou'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, be a very poor Place, if it were not for the Reſort of Foreigners; and a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> told me, that when they were at War with <hi>England,</hi> their White Bread immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately turn'd to Brown; intimating, their Riches did not come from their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe of my Stay here, gave me no ſmall Joy; for a Letter came to my Hands from my dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which was left at the Poſt-Houſe of <hi>Dover,</hi> and brought me by the ſame Captain I came over with to <hi>Calais.</hi> This prov'd a Conſolation to me in all my Travels; for whenever I was melancholy, I had Recourſe to that. The Letter was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>WHAT ſhall I ſay? I have not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions enough to paint out my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thy Abſence, and the farther thou goeſt from me, increaſe my Love and Anxiety. I look on the all-ſeeing Sun, and bleſs his Beams,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0201000402:5"/>
becauſe it ſhines on thee. I worſhip the Winds, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do the Devil, for fear their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhou'd be prejudicial to thee; and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 'em, with their Names, almoſt equals the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Saints, yet I am oblig'd to revere 'em all in groſs, as they do. My Time is almoſt ſpent in reading the Accounts of Places where I ſuppoſe the Diſpoſer of my Heart is to viſit. I have found the Road to <hi>Dover,</hi> and din'd with you in Imagination, tho' Food is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a Stranger to me. I ſaw your Horſes brought out, and purſu'd the Way with you to <hi>Dover.</hi> I ſaw the Caſtle, the Pier, and view'd the fatal Veſſel deſign'd to waft from me all my Peace of Mind.</p>
                     <p>I follow'd it as far as my poor Eyes cou'd ſee, and waited on the Beach, ſighing to the Winds, till you arriv'd at <hi>Calais,</hi> as fatal to me for my Loſs, as the Loſs of That was to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Siſter to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who, when ſhe dy'd, told her Attendants, <hi>they might ſee</hi> Calais <hi>written on her Heart.</hi> If Death ſhou'd end my Days, thy Image wou'd be found on mine. To be a Day without ſeeing the Idol of my Soul, I have thought long; but Oh! to be abſent for three times three hundred and ſixty five Days, nay, perhaps for ever! what Heart, like mine, can bear the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0201000402:6"/>
But yet the Day will come; two tedious Days of the Time are gone already. If Heav'n will be pleas'd to ſend you back, I ſhall be grown, by that time, well vers'd in Geography, for that ſhall be now my only Study; and I ſhall think it ſome Satisfaction in all my Griefs, to know the Situation, Climate, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Places my Love intends to viſit.

            <p>When our Embargo was taken off, we took Poſt-Chaiſes, and arriv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> in three Days; from whence, in compliance to my Uncle, I ſent him the following ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Journey.</p>

                  <p>AFTER turning my Back to my Native Country (tho' my Mind was ſtill there) we arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Calais;</hi> from thence (after being detain'd four Days by a falſe Report of the King's Death) we made three hard Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to <hi>Paris.</hi> From whence I ſhall ſend you this ſhort Deſcription, to let you ſee I intend to follow your Precepts exactly. <hi>Paris,</hi> the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0201000402:7"/>
of <hi>France,</hi> is ſituated upon an Iſland in the River <hi>Seine,</hi> which gives Name to a County, call'd, the <hi>Iſle of France;</hi> tho' it is poſſible it may ſtand upon more Ground than <hi>London,</hi> yet I take the latter to be better inhabited than the former. Their publick Buildings far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ours in Number and Magnificence. The <hi>Louvre</hi> much ſurpaſſes that of <hi>St. James's</hi> or <hi>Whitehall</hi> before it was conſum'd by Fire. As to their Cathedral Church of <hi>Notre-Dame,</hi> I can't make any Compariſon with that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, till I ſee it finiſh'd; but I think this, a noble auguſt Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the Magnificence of the Inſide ſhews their Religion to be well dreſt, and gives a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre I am not able to deſcribe. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ſeems to be ſeated with more Grandeur than an Eaſtern King.</p>
                  <p>Here's Plenty of Wine, but no good Water that I cou'd meet with. In the Chapel call'd <hi>The Holy Chapel,</hi> which is a fine Building, I was ſhew'd Part of the Crown of Thorns the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Deriſon, honour'd our Saviour with; and two of the Nails that fixt him to the Croſs; but, I muſt own, my Faith was not quite ſtrong enough to believe it, tho' I thought it prudent to keep my Thoughts to myſelf. The Monaſteries are ſo numerous here, that one wou'd imagine the Laity were not the major Part; and moſt of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0201000402:8"/>
Holy Buildings are fit to be Palaces for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes.</p>
                  <p>The Earth, in one of their Churchyards, as I am told, will conſume the Interr'd in eight Days. The reverend Father <hi>Raimond,</hi> whom you commended me to, has been dead more than four Years: But his Brother, who has taken Orders ſince, who was alſo one of your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, has done me many Services upon your Account. Laſt Night he took me to the <hi>Jeſuits-College,</hi> where a Play was perform'd with the utmoſt Magnificence, and the Number of the Chorus Dancers ſurpris'd me. I counted forty-four in one Entry. In ſhort, Sir, <hi>Paris</hi> has many curious Objects to delight the Eye, and captivate the Senſes. I have ſent you the Book of the <hi>Carrouſels</hi> that were perform'd <hi>1612,</hi> when the double Marriages of the King and his Siſter, with the Prince and Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> were celebrated. In the ſame Place King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry II.</hi> in one of thoſe Tournaments, was kill'd by a Wound in the Eye. I am inform'd by Monſieur <hi>Coypel</hi> the Ingraver, the Figure of every Perſon is exactly like whom it is deſign'd for. I have alſo ſent you the Statue of <hi>Lewis the Thirteenth,</hi> of the ſame Compoſition, in every degree, that ſtands in the middle of the <hi>Palace-Royal,</hi> and, in my Judgment, it wants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0201000402:9"/>
nothing but Bulk, to be as fine as the Original. You will likewiſe find in the ſame Parcel all the <hi>Claſſics</hi> printed at the <hi>Louvre;</hi> tho' I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to Father <hi>Raimond</hi> for your Favourite <hi>Terence;</hi> the reſt I procur'd of a Bookſeller. To-morrow, the good Father is to introduce me to Monſieur and Madam <hi>D'Acier,</hi> where I promiſe to myſelf much Satisfaction, if my want of Years will not make 'em look coldly upon me. I gave Monſieur <hi>Audran</hi> the Preſent you ſent him; and, in return, he has ſent you a Set of his Battles, from <hi>Le Brun,</hi> of the firſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which, by the by, Uncle, ſeem'd as if you had ſent (as they ſay in <hi>Wales) Apple-Sauce to fetch a Pig;</hi> for they are hardly to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd.</p>
                  <p>After telling you, the Dirt of <hi>Paris,</hi> like an ill Reputation, is hard to be got off, I ſhall conclude my little Account of that City, with telling you, the Monaſtery of <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> is, I think, one of the fineſt Buildings in <hi>Paris,</hi> which one of their Poets has thought fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in the following Lines.</p>

                  <p>Nothing in the World can ſhew the Grandeur of the Monarch more, than this Palace and Gardens. And the Nobility, to imitate their Prince, have built handſome Palaces near <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles,</hi> ſo that this Place, that was, fifty Years ago, a barren Spot, is now become a great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0201000402:12"/>
I mean, for the Multiplicity of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; tho' every thing is exceſſive dear, from the great Concourſe of Nobility that ſurround their Prince. A <hi>French</hi> Gentleman that had been in <hi>England,</hi> told me, he wonder'd the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had not more magnificent Palaces, Gardens and Water-Works. I reply'd, we had finer Water-Works than any they cou'd boaſt of. Water-Works! return'd the <hi>Frenchman;</hi> where? I reply'd, in the City of <hi>London,</hi> where every Houſe had a Sufficiency of Water, convey'd from the Rivers by Pipes. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd indeed, that was a very great Work, and was certainly of more Uſe than theirs of <hi>Verſailles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> Father <hi>Raimond</hi> carry'd me to a little Village call'd <hi>Mont Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,</hi> or <hi>Mons Martyrum,</hi> where we din'd at the Abbey of Nuns of the Order of St. <hi>Bennet.</hi> This Hill and Village took its Name of <hi>Mons Martyrum,</hi> from St. <hi>Denis</hi> the Protector of <hi>France,</hi> who was beheaded before the Image of <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the <hi>Pagans</hi> Time. And the good People will have it, that the pious Saint walk'd three Mile with his Head under his Arm, and then let it drop; where ſince they have built a Town, after the Saint's Name. But I am apt to believe, their Heads that approve this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0201000402:13"/>
Story are no more a Burden to their Shoulders, than the good Saint's was when he had it under his Arm. Father <hi>Raimond,</hi> otherwiſe Bigot enough to his Religion, ſeems to laugh at ſuch Traditional Stories.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Afternoon we made a Tour to the Town of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where we view'd the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, which is very magnificent; tho' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory of their Kings, to me, ſeem'd the chiefeſt Ornament. The Inhabitants tell you, this Church was never ill us'd, either in the <hi>Norman</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wars; tho' moſt of the others in <hi>France,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Normans</hi> came, ſuffer'd much. The Abbot of this Place has more Power than many Archbiſhops, and owns no Superior but the King, being Suffragan to no Archbiſhop, And tho' the Monarchs of <hi>France</hi> are crown'd at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> the <hi>Regalia</hi> is kept at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> under the Care of the <hi>Abbot.</hi> They alſo Boaſt of more Relicks than any other Place in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; as, the Head of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> put in a ſilver Nightcap, with fine oriental Pearl round it; a Nail of our Saviour's Croſs; the Finger that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> put into our Saviour's Side; an Arm of St. <hi>Simon;</hi> the Head of St. <hi>Bennet;</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> that was with me the ſame time we ſaw theſe Rarities, told me St. <hi>Bennet</hi> muſt be a very monſtrous Saint, for he knew of one of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0201000402:14"/>
his Heads in <hi>Italy,</hi> and another in <hi>Spain;</hi> but his Companion ſalv'd that, by telling him, he ſhed his Heads, as Stags do their Horns. I hope you'll pardon this merry Account, ſince it is not my own. Then there is a Cup that King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> us'd to drink out of; but my merry <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi> affronted the Friar that ſhew'd us theſe Rarities, by asking him, if King <hi>Soloman</hi> drank it full always, for it was a very large one. A Pot that was at the Wedding of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> where our Saviour turn'd Water into Wine; <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Arc</hi>'s Sword, which I think is bigger than that of <hi>Edward the Third</hi>'s, in <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi>'s Chapel in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey; Judas</hi>'s Lanthorn, that he bore when he betray'd our Saviour with a Kiſs; and many more which we did not ſee; for when our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Companion ask'd the Friar, how often the Horns had been mended, he grew outrageous, and wou'd ſhew us no more; and Father <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was very much ſcandaliz'd in bringing ſuch a Parcel of <hi>Hereticks</hi> to profane their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, by looking on 'em.</p>
                  <p>I am much pleas'd with my Tutor; tho' he ſeems very reſerv'd in giving me any Account of his former Condition or Family. Tho' an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happen'd a few Days ago, that makes me imagine there's ſomething very extraordinary in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0201000402:15"/>
his Affairs. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> young Gentleman, a Traveller, did me the Honour to make me a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ſome few Days ago; and my Tutor coming in, ſeem'd in the utmoſt Confuſion at his Sight, and went out of the Room (unperceiv'd by my Viſitor) with a great deal of Precipitation. In a Day or two afterwards, when I inform'd him I was to dine with the ſame Perſon, he intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me very earneſtly to be excus'd; and told me, he had ſuch Reaſons for not ſeeing him, that if I was acquainted with 'em, I wou'd certainly pardon him in deſiring not to be in his Company. I fanſy, when we are a little more familiar, he will be more free, and let me into this Affair. I muſt confeſs, it puzzles me very much. I ſhall not give you any farther Trouble now, my dear Uncle; but be pleas'd to give my Reſpects to the amiable Family we laſt viſited; and give me Leave to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

                        <hi>I</hi> KNOW for certain your Life is in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, therefore wou'd adviſe you to quit the Place as ſoon and as ſecretly as you can. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance imagines the Coldneſs of his Miſtreſs proceeds from the Eſteem ſhe has for you. I have in vain endeavour'd to convince him of the contrary. Perhaps I ſhould not be in ſo much Fear for you, if he had Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity enough openly to reſent his ill-grounded Hatred to you; but I know him to he a Perſon as void of Honour, as of Courage, therefore every thing is to be fear'd from him. Take care of the Servant you have hir'd, for I have taken notice they are often together. It is poſſible there may be no Harm in their Intimacy; however, I think Caution is neceſſary. Therefore, if you pleaſe, I will borrow him for a few Days, and ſend him upon a Buſineſs that he may execute for me as well as an honeſt Man, if he ſhou'd prove a Villain. I wou'd not have you ſtir out to-day,

            <p>The receiving of this Letter very much ſurpriz'd me; for all the Time I remain'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> I had not made any Acquaintance with the Fair Sex; and, bating the Viſit I made to Monſieur and Madam <hi>D'Acier,</hi> I had not been in the Company of any Females. The Thoughts of leaving <hi>Paris</hi> very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joic'd my Tutor, who was never eaſy, upon the Account of that young Gentleman. I communicated the Letter to him, who was as much ſurpriz'd as I was. In the Evening Father <hi>Raimond</hi> came, and preſs'd me to be gone the next Day. He inform'd me his Acquaintance had courted a young Lady, and ſhew'd him a Letter from the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where ſhe herſelf inform'd him of all he knew, and was as preſſing for me to be gone, as the good Father. Therefore I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſet out for <hi>Marſeilles</hi> the next Day, in order to imbark for <hi>Italy,</hi> and my Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage was to follow me. I ſent my <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0201000402:18"/>
Servant to the good Father, who took him home that Night; and the next Morning I purſu'd my Journey with my Tutor, and my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Servant, who might very well paſs for a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> for he ſpoke that Language as well as <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I was very much ſurpriz'd and vex'd at this Accident, for having got acquainted with ſeveral Perſons of the <hi>Royal-Academy</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> I had the pleaſing Hope of cultivating my Underſtanding by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; for Study, and the Thoughts of my lovely <hi>Iſabella,</hi> fill'd up all my Time.</p>
            <p>In our third Day's Journey, near the Skirts of a Wood, we were attack'd by half a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Robbers, who wou'd have certainly got the better of us, if, while we were engag'd with them, two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, with their Servants, had not arriv'd ſeaſonably to our Reſcue. We left two dead upon the Place, and the other four made their Eſcape. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen the Thanks they deſerv'd for their Succour; for if they had not come to our Aſſiſtance, we muſt certainly have been murder'd; but, by the Providence of God, not one of us was wounded. The Gentlemen were bound for <hi>Toulon,</hi> therefore I reſolv'd to accompany them to that Place, which lay as convenient (they inform'd me)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0201000402:19"/>
to embark for <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> We thought it proper to puſh on, without taking any Notice of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> happen'd to us, becauſe it wou'd retard our Journey; tho' we might have receiv'd a Reward for the Death of the two Thieves. We all arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Toulon,</hi> without meeting any other Accident by the way; from whence I ſent Orders to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles</hi> for my Baggage to be brought from thence. But the <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen leaving me the next Day, I thought it proper to go to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> myſelf. <hi>Toulon,</hi> the <hi>Telo Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is a Biſhoprick, and has a very fine Port, and very ſtrongly fortify'd. The two great Moles, of 700 Paces each, that almoſt cover the whole Port, has not been many Years finiſh'd by the preſent King, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. tho' begun by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. When I arriv'd at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which lies about 40 Miles from <hi>Toulon,</hi> I receiv'd a Packet of Letters from <hi>England,</hi> which the good Father <hi>Raimond</hi> took care to ſend, with another from <hi>Paris</hi> from an unknown Lady, that unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd the Meaning of my ſo ſuddenly leaving that City, the Letter was as follows:

                        <hi>I</hi> AM in Love, and have long been belov'd by a Gentleman, that has taken it into his Head to be jealous of you, tho' I never had the Honour of converſing with you. I have ſeen you, I muſt confeſs, and had the Inadvertency to commend you before him, tho' without any farther Thought; for the Perſon I mention has laid ſuch Hold of my Heart, it can never get from him. 'Twas I that us'd that Method with Father <hi>Raimond,</hi> to make you abandon <hi>Paris,</hi> which I hope you will forgive, for I ſhou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have brought to Temper the Heart of him whom I love more than myſelf, if you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd here. The Deſign upon your Life was all Fiction, for the Man whom I adore has too much Honour to deal ſo treacherouſly with any Perſon. His only Fault is Jealouſy, but that's a Sign of his Paſſion for me. As you came to <hi>Paris</hi> as a Traveller, I hope your ſudden leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will not prove prejudicial to you.

            <p>I was compell'd to wait a Fortnight for want of a Veſſel to imbark in for <hi>Genoa,</hi> and therefore had Leiſure enough to view this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Marſeilles</hi> is a City of the greateſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in <hi>France.</hi> It was founded by the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> a Colony from <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells me. It is one of the fineſt Ports of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſafeſt, for it was never known any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ever periſh'd there by Storm. It was a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0201000402:22"/>
flouriſhing City in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who made Alliances with 'em, finding it not an eaſy Matter to overcome it. By the Means of its <hi>Levant</hi> Trade, it is eſteem'd the richeſt City in <hi>France</hi>; and its Situation upon the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> makes it ſo advantageous for Trade, that it will ever prove ſo. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was free, till the Year 1481, when it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the King of <hi>France,</hi> with the reſt of <hi>Provence.</hi> It is ſo well Peopled, that it is difficult to walk the Streets, for the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Paſſengers backwards and forwards. The publick Buildings are very magnificent. Here the Gallies of the Crown are kept in admirable Order, under command of a ſtrong Tier of Guns. The Churches and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are numerous, and beautiful, and the Clergy here ſeem more open and facetious, than in any other Place I have ſeen in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I embark'd for <hi>Genoa</hi> in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel bound for that Place; but in the Dusk of the Evening, which ſucceeded the firſt Day of our Voyage, we were purſu'd by a Corſair of <hi>Tunis.</hi> The Fright and Confuſion was very great, for our Veſſel carry'd but Eight Guns, and Sixteen Men, beſides Eight Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers. The Maſter made many falſe Tacks,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0201000402:23"/>
in hopes to loſe him in the Night; but at the Dawn of Day, we diſcover'd him about two Leagues to Leeward of us, and the Wind ceaſing with the Riſing of the Sun, we had no Hopes to eſcape, for they made up to us with their Oars, which we were without. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, both Sailors and Paſſengers reſolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Defence, and the rather, becauſe we obſerv'd a Veſſel under the <hi>French</hi> Shore, who, by her Working, ſeem'd to endeavour to come up to us; tho' ſome of the moſt timorous wou'd have it another Rover of <hi>Barbary.</hi> Notwithſtanding, we made ready to receive 'em. But the Wind freſhning a little, we choſe to make all the Sail we cou'd for the Port of <hi>Toulon,</hi> not above Seven Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from us. But our Endeavours prov'd fruitleſs, for before Eight a Clock ſhe came within Gun-ſhot of us, and ply'd us with her fore-chace Guns, tho' without any Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, for not one of the Shot enter'd our Ship; which they perceiving, left off firing, becauſe it retarded their Courſe, and row'd hard to come along ſide of us, which they did in an Hour from their firſt Firing. When they came within Haling, they bid us ſtrike that Moment, or every Man (when we were taken) ſhou'd be flung overboard. But we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0201000402:24"/>
gave 'em no other Anſwer, than with our great Guns, and ſmall Arms, which I believe they did not expect. But they return'd our Civility with Intereſt; and after plying it warmly on both Sides for half an Hour, they boarded us on our Forecaſtle; and thoſe that underſtood their Language, declar'd we ſhou'd all fall a Sacrifice to their Revenge. The Knowledge of that gave us freſh Reſolution to fell our Lives as dear as we cou'd; but an accidental Shot taking away our Colours, the Rovers thought we had ſtruck to 'em, which gave 'em ſome Pauſe. But when they found we continu'd the Fight, even to Deſperation, they fell on furiouſly again. But a lucky Shot from us, flew into their Powder-Room, and blew up their Quarter within two Foot of the Water. This gave us freſh Courage, and we clear'd the Deck of all that were alive on Board us. They cut off their Grapples, and fell a Stern, but ſtill ply'd us with their ſmall and great Shot. We made all the Sail we cou'd to get out of their way, and, by degrees, left 'em out of Gun-ſhot; but found our Ship ſhot thro' in ſeveral Places between Wind and Water, and we were forc'd to lie by to ſtop our Leaks. While we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to find 'em out, it was a great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0201000402:25"/>
to me to ſee the other Ship we ſaw under the Shore, get up with the <hi>Corſair,</hi> and engage her; they fought furiouſly about half an Hour, but at laſt overcame her; yet that Satisfaction was allay'd, by my being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd our Leaks cou'd not be found; and the Water gain'd upon us, notwithſtanding they labour'd hard at the Pump. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter immediately made a Signal of Diſtreſs, and the Ship and Prize came to our Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The Ship prov'd a <hi>Spaniſh Gard de Coſte.</hi> The Captain came on Board us, and very civilly offer'd me a Cabbin of his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's, who was kill'd in the Engagement with the <hi>Corſair.</hi> I was much pleas'd with the Offer, and got my Things remov'd on Board. The Captain's Name was <hi>Don Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an de Fonſeca</hi>; his Ship from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> of 30 Guns, where he was oblig'd to go to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for this was his ſecond Engagement. In the firſt, he had ſunk a Rover of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who went to the Bottom, without ſaving one Human Creature. Our Ship had made ſhift to ſtop her Leaks, but not ſo effectually as to purſue her Voyage; ſo, after a Conſultation, the Maſter determin'd to [put into <hi>Toulon</hi> to refit. Therefore I reſolv'd to accompany the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> having ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0201000402:26"/>
the <hi>Dutchman</hi> for my Paſſage. I had much ado to make him accept it, telling me I had done him more Service than that came to, in the Engagement. Tho' I, my Tutor, and Servant, had the good Fortune to eſcape without any Wound in our Bodies, yet ſeveral Shot had pierc'd our Cloaths. The Stock of my Carbine was ſhot away, as I was charging it, without doing me any Hurt; and the Hat of my Tutor had part of the Brim ſhot away. We loſt but three Sailors in the deſperate Engagement, and five wounded, two of which were Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Before Night, we parted with the <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and ſaw him, by the Help of a Teleſcope, enter the Harbour of <hi>Toulon,</hi> ere it was dark; and we purſu'd our Voyage for <hi>Barcelona,</hi> accompany'd with the <hi>Algerine</hi> Prize.</p>
            <p>The Captain of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> loſt nineteen Men in this laſt Engagement, and thirty-five in the former, beſides thirty wounded in both, ſo that his Complement was ſo very much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd, that if it had not been for the Help of the Galley-Slaves out of the <hi>Corſair</hi> (who were moſt <hi>Spaniards</hi>) he cou'd not have work'd his Ship. The Captain of the Prize was a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Renegade, who was intended
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0201000402:27"/>
to be executed as ſoon as we arriv'd in <hi>Spain</hi>; but a Wound he received in the Groin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, for he expir'd before we got into Harbour. The reſt were <hi>Moors,</hi> therefore intended for the Gallies of <hi>Spain</hi>; their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement was 280 Men, when they firſt ſet out a Roving, but they had loſt 27 in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with us, beſides 11 that were blown up with their Powder; and 59 with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard. Don Juan de Fonſeca</hi> made me a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a very fine <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Scimitar, adorn'd with wrought Gold, which very much pleas'd me; and in Return, I made him, with a great many Intreaties, accept of a Gold Watch of <hi>Tompion</hi>'s make; but I had almoſt affronted him, when I offer'd to ſatisfy him for my Paſſage to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd without any Impediment. He did me the Honour to introduce me to the Governor, and ſaid ſo many things in my Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that made me aſham'd to hear 'em. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are noted for Hyperboles. However, the Governor us'd me with a great deal of Civility, wondering a Perſon ſo young, ſhou'd begin his Travels ſo early; and order'd me an Apartment in the Caſtle; and in all the time I continu'd there, never preſs'd me to go to Maſs, or once ask'd me
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0201000402:28"/>
concerning my Religion, which I was very well pleas'd at; for he was aſſur'd I was a Proteſtant, by my Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Juan de Fonſeca</hi> was hardly ever from me; and the Civilities I receiv'd from him, I ſhall never forget. I found nothing of the ſtiff formal <hi>Spaniard</hi> in him, nor indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong any I had the Fortune to converſe with; ſo that I imagine the general Character of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> we receive in <hi>England,</hi> is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether true. They are certainly cautious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Women, yet not all out; ſo much as I expected, for I never was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into any Family, without ſeeing the Female Part of it; but they never ſtay long in Company; or indeed ſeldom look at any Strangers, but when they are ſpoke to, or juſt upon their Entrance into a Room, and when they take their Leave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barcelona</hi> (the <hi>Roman Barcino</hi>) is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of the Province of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> It was built by <hi>Barca</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> from whom it takes its Name. Though ſometimes it was call'd by the <hi>Romans, Faventia Colonia,</hi> and <hi>Julia Auguſta</hi> It was taken from the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Lewis the Pious,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> It has two Rivers that waſh the North and South Side, tho' neither of them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0201000402:29"/>
of any great Note. The Mole is a very fine one, tho' the Harbour being ſo full of Sand, will not permit large Veſſels Entrance. The Buildings are very handſome, tho' it does not exceed <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in any thing; and for Trade, it falls very ſhort. I was advis'd by every Body to Winter at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which I reſolv'd to do to perfect myſelf in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Nothing extraordinary happen'd to me while I was there; tho' Murders were committed almoſt every Night, which is reckon'd nothing there. One Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was murder'd by her Brother, as ſhe came from her Devotion at the Cathedral Church. This poor Lady, it ſeems, had an Intrigue with one of the Dons of the Place, and the Brother came as far as <hi>Toledo</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Stain of his Family, as he call'd it; and I never knew he was ſo much as impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd for it. Another Perſon of Note was ſhot thro' the Back, as he was making Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt a Wall: This Gentleman, it ſeems, had been too buſy with another Man's Wife, as the Rumour went, tho' the Adventure was forgot the next Day.</p>
            <p>The Death of one Gentleman gave me ſome Concern, having ſome Knowledge of him. He was a Perſon of good Extraction,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0201000402:30"/>
but his Family was fallen to Decay. He made his Addreſſes to a beautiful Lady, and gain'd her Affection; but the Parents of the Lady got him a Poſt to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> not out of Love, but to get him out of the way. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the enamour'd Couple correſponded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by Letter for two Years. In the mean time, her Parents reſolv'd to wed her, againſt her Will, to a rich <hi>Spaniard</hi> of Quality, that was in Love with her. The young Lady ſent Word to her Lover, of her unhappy Marriage that was approaching, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make her Eſcape, but was prevented by the Infidelity of her Confidant. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, underſtanding how Matters went, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd his Poſt in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Barcelona</hi> ten Days after the fatal Marriage was conſummated. The News almoſt broke his Heart; and his Paſſion was ſo violent, that he caſt many ways to get a Sight of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and at laſt obtain'd it. They had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Meetings at a Friend's Houſe of the Gentleman's; but I was inform'd by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that knew the Affair, that all their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were very innocent. At laſt, they were diſcover'd by the new Husband, who hir'd ſeveral Bravos, that did their Work ſo well, the poor Gentleman was murder'd as he was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0201000402:31"/>
juſt entring the Door where his Miſtreſs wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him. Some time after, the Husband met with the ſame Fate, as he came from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting a new Miſtreſs. Some ſuppos'd the Wife had a Hand in the Murder; but it was never found out; and the Lady went into a Monaſtery. Before I left <hi>Barcelona,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Letter from my dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with ſeveral from my Uncle and Father; that of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s was as follows:

            <p>This Letter was the only Joy I receiv'd, all the while I was at <hi>Barcelona</hi>; tho' I was diſturb'd at the Account of my Rival's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his Addreſſes. The Governor ask'd me if I had not gain'd a Miſtreſs, ſince my Arrival; and when I anſwer'd him in the Negative, he ſeem'd ſurpriz'd! Sure, ſaid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0201000402:33"/>
he, you muſt have a very inſenſible Heart, not to feel the Charms of Love in ſo warm a Climate, where it is almoſt the chief Buſineſs of the Nation. But alas! he knew little of my Soul, which felt the Pangs of Love in a much colder Climate than <hi>Spain.</hi> I receiv'd ſo many Civilities from this Gentleman, that very much perplex'd me, becauſe I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary to make him a Return; and, to add to the Obligations I had to him, when I left <hi>Barcelona,</hi> he gave me Leave to redeem a Slave from the Galleys, which is eſteem'd the greateſt Honour can be done to any Stranger: Tho' I did not take ſo much Time to examine the Demerits of the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, as a Nobleman did; who, having the ſame Honour done him, ask'd all the Slaves the Crimes that brought them into that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but every one of 'em, to the laſt Man, told him, they were either put in by Malice, or Miſtake: But the laſt Man told him frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He cou'd not ſay but he was put in very juſtly, for taking a Purſe in <hi>Tarragona,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the Owner. The Duke, upon this, gave him a Stroke with his Cane, You Rogue, ſaid he, what do you here, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch a Parcel of honeſt innocent Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? Get about your Buſineſs! The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0201000402:34"/>
I redeem'd, was both old, and unhealthy, and therefore I thought him the propereſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among 'em, that he might have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ending the Remainder of his Days in Freedom.</p>
            <p>I obſerv'd a gloomy Melancholy had ſeiz'd my Tutor, and tho' I ſtrove all I cou'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him, yet I found it to no Purpoſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cou'd I prevail upon him to know the Cauſe of his Sorrow; he only anſwer'd me, that it was his natural Diſpoſition. But I ſaw too much of him, not to know his Diſeaſe lay in the Mind; yet had Hope, Time, and the various Climates we ſhou'd viſit, wou'd cure him; but hitherto his Malady increas'd. One Day, when I was retir'd to my Cloſet, to write ſome Letters to <hi>England,</hi> he came into the Room, not knowing I was there, and for ſome time ſigh'd and wept bitterly; at laſt, he broke out into ſomething like the following Complaint. Sure never wretched Mortal ever felt the Pains and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I have undergone! They are too great to bear! All-ſeeing Heaven, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts theſe Puniſhments upon us, creeping Things, ſure will forgive us, if we ſeek a Remedy by Death, for nought but Death can cure my Misfortunes. As he was going
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0201000402:35"/>
on with his Complaints, I purpoſely made a Rumbling in my Cloſet, which he hearing, was going down Stairs; but I prevented him, by opening the Cloſet-Door, and call'd him back. Well, Governor, ſaid I, will you ſtill perſiſt in Grief, and yet tell me you have nothing troubles you? I am ſorry you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a want of Confidence in me, whom I would have you reckon among the Number of your Friends, and you may command every thing in my Power as ſuch. Sir, anſwer'd my Governor (in much Confuſion) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of your Goodneſs to me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have, in a ſhort Narrative, written the Account of my Misfortunes, which I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your Peruſal after my Death; and, when you have conſider'd 'em, I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd you will not blame me for cutting off my Cares with my Life. I ſhall blame you for nothing, I reply'd, but your perſiſting in that melancholy Thought. Conſider the Task you have undertaken, that of returning me ſafe to my Uncle: Alſo remember, Time works many ſtrange Cures of the Mind, as well as the Body. In common Calamities, I own, reply'd my Tutor, Time is a very good Phyſician; but when the Malady is lodg'd in the Soul, and no Balm to heal it on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0201000402:36"/>
this ſide the Grave, Time only makes the Burden too heavy to be born. However, I own there is a Duty incumbent upon me, on your Account, and I will lay aſide my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Dying, till you have perus'd this fatal Account of my unfortunate Life, and then, I doubt not, but you will, out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, diſmiſs me to the peaceful Grave. When he had done ſpeaking, he put into my Hands the following Relation.</p>

                        <p>MY Family is not of the meaneſt, tho' I was born to ſuffer unheard-of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, thro' an unhappy Paſſion. In my Youth, I was brought up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; but being left to the Care of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a Clergyman of the Proteſtant Religion,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0201000402:37"/>
he ſoon wip'd away the Notions I had receiv'd from my Infancy, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. But as it little concerns my wretched Life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late any thing farther of my Minority, I ſhall ſtep at once into my melancholy Story.</p>
                        <p>After leaving the Univerſity, my Uncle took me to dwell with him, intending, as ſoon as poſſible, I ſhou'd take my Degrees, in order to procure me a Living; but in the mean time, Fate was at work. Riding one Summer-Evening to take the Air, the Sun ſo powerfully ſhone upon me, that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to go to the Skirts of a Wood, for Shelter from his fiery Beams. The Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inviting, I got from my Horſe, and laid me down upon the Graſs, ſetting myſelf to read, and inſenſibly fell aſleep; but was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd with the Neighing of a Horſe in the neighbouring Wood, which I found was my own, that had ſlipt off his Bridle, and left me; taking the Bridle in my Hand, I went to catch him, but, being a Horſe of Spirit, he led me from Place to Place, not ſuffering me to come near him. I was ſo much fatigu'd in following him, that I was conſtrain'd once more to ſit down, and let him graze in my Sight. In a few Moments I heard the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another Horſe, in the adjacent Thicket,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0201000402:38"/>
which mine ſoon anſwer'd, and gallop'd that way the Noiſe proceeded from. I was oblig'd once more to riſe, and follow him, and at laſt came up with him, where I found him playing his Pranks with another Horſe, and a Gentleman whipping him, to get 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; but with the Buſtle, the other Horſe got looſe alſo, and away they ran together, kicking and biting each other, ſo that each of us fear'd the Loſs of his Horſe. As I was going to follow 'em once more, I heard a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Voice call to me, <hi>For Heaven's ſake, Sir</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>if you're a Man, ſuccour a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs'd Woman, who is in danger of loſing her Honour, and her Life.</hi> Tho' I did not ſet up for a Knight-Errant, Curioſity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity made me turn back, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Turning about, I ſaw him within ten Paces, with his Sword drawn, running upon me; I had no Weapon, therefore thought it adviſeable to deſiſt, and expoſtulate with him; but he wou'd not hear Reaſon, nor tell me
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0201000402:39"/>
the Meaning of this Adventure. I was in a very great Dilemma, between his Threats, and the perſuaſive Rhetoric of the ſuffering Lady; but at laſt reſolv'd, notwithſtanding the apparent Danger, to releaſe her, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but as ſoon as he perceiv'd my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ran at me with his Sword, crying, Nay then, take thy Death firſt. Having my Bridle in my Hand, I ſtruck at him with a good Force, and, by good Providence, ſtruck his Sword out of his Hand; and as he ſtoop'd to take it up, I repeated my Blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head, and the Bridle being a Curb, I ſtun'd him with the Stroke, ſo that he lay ſpeechleſs, grovelling on the Earth, and I run to free the Lady. But finding ſome Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hot regarding the Man, he was got up; and running once more upon me with his Sword (which I ſhou'd have ſecur'd) wou'd infallibly have diſpatch'd me, if the Lady had not cry'd out; yet I cou'd not avoid being run thro' the Side, tho' no more than a Fleſh Wound; he then ſeiz'd me, and we ſtruggled together a long time; but he being very ſtrong, and I weak with my Wound, he got me down, and with the Fall, the Sword flew out of my Side. I graſp'd him cloſe about the Neck, ſo that he cou'd hardly breathe;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0201000402:40"/>
but he muſt have made an End of me, if the Lady had not releas'd herſelf, with the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance I had given her before, who took up his Sword, and run him into the Leg, the Pain of which made him let go his Hold of me, and I got up again, ſnatch'd the Sword from him, which he had drawn out of his Leg, and ſtruck him ſo forcibly over his Head, that I once more ſent him breathleſs to the Ground. I was juſt going to run the Sword into his Body, in my Heat of Paſſion; but I conſider'd immediately, it wou'd look like an Action of Barbarity to ſtab a defenceleſs Man, therefore I deſiſted; and in a few Moments after, I fell ſpeechleſs by him, with Loſs of Blood; but was brought to my Senſes by a violent Pain in my Leg, that the barbarous Wretch had given me, in wounding me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times with his Penknife, as I lay unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Defence.</p>
                        <p>He did his utmoſt to reach my Breaſt, but he was ſo feeble with his Wounds, that he cou'd not get any farther. I roſe in a violent Paſſion, and wrench'd it from him, intending to put an End to his Life; but my feebler Strength cou'd not obey my Fury; therefore I ſeated myſelf as far from him as I cou'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting my laſt Moments, for the Lady was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0201000402:41"/>
fled, and little Hopes of Succour appear'd, we being in a Wood above a Mile from any Road. I had nothing now to do, but make my Peace with Heaven. While I was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, I perceiv'd five Men with the Wretch's Horſe, coming towards us. As ſoon as he perceiv'd 'em, he cry'd out, with all the Tranſport his Strength wou'd allow of, Now, Villain! thy wretched Fate approaches. Here, ſaid he, to one of the Fellows, take that Villain, that has in this manner baſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd your Maſter, and hew him to Pieces. Notwithſtanding I thought Death was near, without any farther Violence, yet I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to defend myſelf as well as I cou'd, therefore ſnatch'd up the Sword that lay near me, and put my Back againſt a Tree, for without that Support, I had not Strength to ſtand; the Villains, one and all, came furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly towards me, but I kept 'em ſome time from wounding me, by means of the Sword, thruſting the moſt eager of 'em into the Throat. But finding my Strength failing me, I made one Effort before I fainted, and thruſt my Sword into the Body of their Maſter, who was endeavouring to riſe, falling upon him at the ſame time, for want of Strength. That Moment, ſeveral Country Fellows came ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0201000402:42"/>
upon the Servants of the inhuman Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and drove 'em out of the Wood, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral of 'em; two of 'em came to me, and ſupported me, while another that was a Surgeon, examin'd my Wounds. Have Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſaid he, Sir, your Hurts are not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, tho' your Loſs of Blood makes you faint. I thank'd 'em for their ſeaſonable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which was ſurely ſent from Heaven, for one Moment longer muſt have brought me inevitable Death. Sir, ſaid the Surgeon, the Lady whom you reſcu'd, ſent us to your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, who will be here immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you the Acknowledgments due for ſuch a ſignal Service.</p>
                        <p>After my Wounds were dreſs'd, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon went to examine the Wretch that lay ſpeechleſs, with his Sword in his Body; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drawing it out, he gave two or three Groans, and open'd his Eyes, ſtaring wildly about him for ſome time: When he found how Matters went, What, ſaid he, does that Villain live ſtill? Yes, I reply'd, Heaven guards the Good; and the Title of Villain properly belongs to thee, who wou'd oppreſs Virtue, and wrong the Innocent; and thy Treatment of her and me has been ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that if thy Crimes do not draw the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0201000402:43"/>
Puniſhment of Heaven upon thee, I will ſeek thee out, and endeavour to chaſtiſe thee in a manner, that ſhall ſhew thee I have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got I'm a Gentleman; tho' thou art of the Brute Creation, and only beareſt the outward Form of Man. I'd give, reply'd the Brute, half my Eſtate, to have it in my Power to ſcourge thy Preſumption. He wou'd have ſaid more, but the Probing of his Wounds made him faint. Before they had made an end of Dreſſing him, the Lady arriv'd, attended with ſeveral Servants. Thank Heaven, ſaid ſhe, the Preſerver of my Life and Honour lives. How ſhall I ſhew my grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments? I reply'd, I had done nothing but what every honeſt Man wou'd have done, or ought to have done.</p>
                        <p>This Surgeon interrupted our Diſcourſe, by informing the Lady, it wou'd be dangerous for me to talk much. But I cou'd not avoid ſpeaking with my Eyes, for I found my Heart inſenſibly leaving me. The Charms of the Fair One were too powerful to be withſtood, tho' ruffled and diſorder'd by this unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. After the Surgeon had dreſs'd the Wretch, the Cauſe of this Diſaſter, he ask'd the Lady what muſt be done with him. Leave him, ſaid ſhe, to conſort with his Fellow-Creatures,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0201000402:44"/>
the Beaſts of the Field, for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society will diſown him. Immediately after, the Countrymen return'd, bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them three of the Servants they had taken, all of 'em very much wounded. There, ſaid the Lady, take your villainous Maſter, and ſhut him in ſome dark Cave, for 'tis not ſit he ſhou'd breathe common Air, with honeſt Men; and you (continu'd ſhe) muſt be Brutes like him, to ſerve ſuch a Monſter. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants made their Excuſe, as well as they cou'd, urging their Maſter's Commands, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, for the future, never to be Partners in his Crimes, if they continu'd with him. Well, reply'd the Lady, learn to be honeſt, and Heaven will forgive you: Take the Wretch, your Maſter, and bear him where I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him more; perhaps he may alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſince he finds his Puniſhment comes from Heaven. The ableſt of the Fellows got upon his Maſter's Horſe (which was brought along with mine by the Countrymen) and his Maſter was laid along before him, hardly ſenſible of what they did. But I was ſo weak and faint, they were oblig'd to cut Boughs and make a Hurdle, on which I was laid, and carry'd to a fair Houſe about two Miles from the Wood; yet, notwithſtanding my Weakneſs, I found
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0201000402:45"/>
a ſecret Pleaſure in being under the ſame Roof with a Woman, that had intirely robb'd me of my Heart.</p>
                        <p>My Wounds made me keep my Chamber ſeveral Weeks; tho' I had the Happineſs of ſeeing my Fair One twice a Day, during my Illneſs; and my Paſſion increas'd with my Strength. One Day, before I left my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I begg'd her to inform me how a Woman of her Condition, cou'd be brought into ſuch a dangerous Adventure? Sir, ſaid ſhe, by baſe Treachery, which I will inform you in as few Words as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>This Wretch (for I cannot call him Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho' blind Fortune has beſtow'd her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon him in a laviſh manner) long courted me in vain; tho' my Father, who is now abroad, preſt me very much to accept him for a Husband, blinded by his vaſt Riches, yet my Heart diſdain'd him. When my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went into <hi>Spain</hi> to ſettle his Affairs, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him the Houſe, and order'd the Servants, whenever he came to viſit me, to ſhut the Doors againſt him. This Treatment put him in ſuch a Paſſion, that he broke my Windows, and endeavour'd to come in by Force, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to murder all my Family. Such impudent Proceedings oblig'd me to have my Country
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0201000402:46"/>
Neighbours in my Houſe as a Guard from his inſolent Fury; this was not only trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but expenſive. However, tir'd with his Attempts to no Purpoſe, he left off his Perſecution, and I began to recover my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tranquillity. Near four Months paſt, without my once hearing of him; and when I did, I was inform'd he was making his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to a Lady on the other Side of the Country. The News was infinitely pleaſing to me, and I durſt once more venture abroad, as uſual.</p>
                        <p>One Day, my Woman that had been my Servant from my Infancy, begg'd I wou'd be Godmother to a Grandchild of hers, whoſe Parents liv'd in a Village about five Miles from my Dwelling. I cou'd not refuſe ſuch a trifling Requeſt, tho' it was an Office I did not take any great Delight in. When the Day came, I was oblig'd to go on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, attended with one Man-Servant, and my Woman; for my Coachman was ill of a Fever. When we came within a Quarter of a Mile of the Wood, where Heaven ſent you to my Aſſiſtance, my Woman call'd to mind ſhe had forgot ſome little Preſents I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Mother and the Child; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſent the Footman, in a Hurry, back
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0201000402:47"/>
for 'em, while we propos'd to ride on ſoftly, till he overtook us. As we came within a few Yards of the Wood, my Horſe gave a Start at ſomething, and looking towards the Wood, I perceiv'd, to my dreadful Surprize, the Villain that brought me to the Diſtreſs you reſcu'd me from. He flew out of the Wood, and, on the Inſtant, ſeiz'd my Horſe by the Bridle: Come, Madam, ſaid he, we may now converſe together, without ſcaling Walls to come at you. Fear had ſo ty'd my Tongue, that I cou'd not give him any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but when I found him leading my Horſe to the Wood, I jump'd off, and ran towards the Plain as faſt as my Fear wou'd permit; but to no Purpoſe, he ſoon overtook me, and bore me by Force into the Wood, maugre all my complaining Sighs.</p>
                        <p>When he had hurry'd me about a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, I perceiv'd five or ſix of the Villain's Servants; they immediately ſeiz'd me, and put me before him on Horſeback, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at the ſame time to catch my Horſe, and wait at a certain Place in the Wood, till he came to them. The Barbarian then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd me to a more unfrequented Part of the Wood, where he proceeded to fill my Ears with his nauſeous Courtſhip; but ſtill threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0201000402:48"/>
to uſe Force, if I did not immediately comply. I try'd by all the Perſuaſion I was Miſtreſs of to prevent his horrid Purpoſe, telling him, Time might produce ſtrange things; and if he wou'd forbear any Violence, I wou'd give him leave to viſit me as uſual. No, no, Madam, that's only a Wile (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Monſter) to get out of my Power; but I'll do the Deed, and then leave you to determine whether you will ſend for me, or no. When I found Intreaties wou'd not prevail, I call'd Heaven and Earth to my Aſſiſtance, but to no Purpoſe. He then proceeded to Violence, uſing the moſt horrid Imprecations that he would ſatiate his moſt abominable Luſt, and then murder me to conceal the Deed.</p>
                        <p>I reſiſted as long as my weak Strength wou'd permit; but he at laſt overpower'd me ſo far, as to bind me to the Root of the Tree where you found me; and, no doubt, had fulfill'd his damnable Purpoſe, if your time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aſſiſtance had not ſav'd me. When I found my Deliverer in ſuch imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (purſu'd the Lady) I took up his Sword with an Intention to have kill'd the Villain; but uſing the Weapon with fearful Aukward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wounded him only in the Leg; and,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0201000402:49"/>
perceiving you faint, ran out of the Wood to ſeek for Succour; by good Fortune, I met the Surgeon, and my Servant returning, who got together ſome of my Father's Tenants, that were Hay-making in the Meads near the Wood.</p>
                        <p>As we came to your Succour, I ſaw my Woman lie upon the Ground, bleeding; I ran to her Aſſiſtance; but ſhe cry'd, Good Madam, trouble not yourſelf with a Wretch that has baſely betray'd you; but Heaven has puniſh'd me for my Perfidy, and all I ask is Forgiveneſs from That and you. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me, that my intended Raviſher had given her 500 <hi>l.</hi> to betray me to him in the Manner I have related. I ask'd her, how ſhe came thus wounded? She anſwer'd me, by the Hand of Heaven; as ſhe was waiting till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he odious Deed was finiſh'd, a Horſe came galloping out of the Wood, and running fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon the Beaſt ſhe was on, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in a Fright, ran away with that Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe cou'd neither ſtop him, nor get from off his Back, till he threw her down; her Foot hanging in the Stirrup, ſhe was dragg'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ill the Stirrup broke, and left her in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flition I found her in. I was ſurpriz'd at this Treachery, becauſe I little ſuſpected it, tho'
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0201000402:50"/>
it was obvious enough; yet the Hurry of my Spirits never gave me Leiſure once to think upon any thing but your Safety.</p>
                        <p>The Surgeon, however, was about to dreſs her; but ſhe puſh'd him from her, telling him, his Art was vain, for ſhe was that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expiring; and accordingly, ſhe breath'd her laſt, begging Forgiveneſs of me and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Maugre the Reſentment I had againſt her, I cou'd not help ſhedding a few Tears for her Loſs.</p>
                        <p>The reſt of my Story you are ſufficiently acquainted with, ſince you hazarded your Life to ſave me from the Raviſher, who, as we are inform'd, is expired of his Wounds; and tho' I am a Creature ſo far from wiſhing the Death of any one, that I wou'd give all I am worth to ſave an innocent Perſon's Life; yet I can't help being pleas'd at his Death, ſince it frees me from the Apprehenſion of Suffering, from his Brutal Temper, which I am aſſur'd never will be chang'd.</p>
                        <p>To make my Tale as ſhort as poſſible, I will freely declare to you, dear Sir, that I gain'd her Heart; tho' ſhe proteſted, ſhe wou'd never wed till the Death of her Father, without his Conſent; but that I almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd of, conſidering the Diſparity of our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0201000402:51"/>
Fortunes. Beſides, he was accounted the moſt penurious Wretch on Earth. This gave a Damp to the Joy I receiv'd, when ſhe gave me an Aſſurance of her Heart, tho' ſhe vow'd ſhe would ſuffer a thouſand Deaths, rather than give her Hand to any one, but her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, as ſhe was pleas'd to call me.</p>
                        <p>During my Cure, no Man ever thought himſelf ſo happy as I did, belov'd, and ever in the Preſence of her I lov'd, tho' we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd our Paſſions from all the World. But my Wounds being heal'd, Decency requir'd I ſhou'd be gone, tho' our Separation was equal to the Pangs of Death. All our Conſolation was in our Intercourſe of Letters, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meeting as by Accident.</p>
                        <p>A few Days after our Parting, the Father to my Fair One arriv'd from <hi>Spain.</hi> She ſent me a Note, wherein ſhe advis'd me to make him a Viſit, and endeavour to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate myſelf into his Favour. I waited on him accordingly, but was very much ſurpris'd at my Reception; inſtead of giving me Thanks for the timely Aſſiſtance I gave his Daughter, he ſeem'd very much out of Humour with me; and in an odd, ſtiff, formal manner, told me, The World had been cenſorious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Daughter on my Account, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0201000402:52"/>
deſired I wou'd never enter his Doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I found, to my Grief, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done with him, in favour of my Love; therefore took my Leave, with a Heart full of the greateſt Sorrow. Yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Danger, we continu'd our Correſpondence tho' with a thouſand Fears.</p>
                        <p>I kept nothing a Secret from my good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, who perſuaded me to forget my Paſſion; but that was the only Thing I cou'd not obey him in. The Knowledge of it, gave him a great deal of Uneaſineſs; tho' he was ſo juſt, to pity me, and hop'd Time might work a Cure.</p>
                        <p>One Day, as I was going in Diſguiſe to the Place where I was to receive a Letter from my Love, I ſaw in the Road, a Country Fellow grovelling in the Duſt; when I came up to him, he inform'd me, with a great deal of Pain, that his Horſe had thrown him, and, with the Violence of his Fall, had broke his Leg. He intreated me to give him ſome Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Tho' my Time was ſhort for my own Affair, Compaſſion wou'd not ſuffer me to leave a Man in ſuch Diſtreſs and Anguiſh; therefore I caught his Horſe that was grazing near, and mounting him, led him to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Village, where I procur'd a skilful
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0201000402:53"/>
Surgeon to attend him; but before I took my Leave, he begg'd to ſpeak with me in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. When every body had left the Room, Friend, ſaid he (for I was dreſt in a Country Habit) I have one Favour more to beg of you, which is, to take that Letter; carry it as directed, and for your Pains there's half a Crown; but you muſt do it with all Secrecy. Tell the Perſon you give it to, of my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Condition, and, upon Return with the Anſwer, I ſhall reward you, by giving you another Half Crown, with many Thanks for the Favour. As a Crown was a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Reward, for one in my Habit, to go half a Mile, I durſt not, for fear of ſome Diſcovery, refuſe it; therefore took the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with Promiſe of a quick Return; neither was it out of my way, for it was directed to a Perſon that kept a Publick-Houſe, in the Road where I was to paſs.</p>
                        <p>As I purſuing my little Journey, I call'd to mind the Perſon to whom the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was directed, who had formerly been a Servant to the Father of my Miſtreſs; for ſhe once propos'd a Meeting at his Houſe, but better conſidering, we found a Place more convenient, and leſs to be ſuſpected. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to be jealous of ſome ill Deſign,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0201000402:54"/>
which poſſeſs'd my Fancy ſo ſtrong, that I reſolv'd to open the Seal in ſuch a manner, that the Arms (which further'd my Suſpicion) ſhou'd not be defac'd, if the Contents were innocent of any ill Intent. The firſt Public-Houſe I came at, I went in, and open'd my Letter, where I found to this Effect:

At laſt I reſolv'd to deliver the Letter as directed, to ſee what farther Inlet I cou'd receive in the dangerous Affair. I therefore made the beſt of my way to the Houſe, where I fortunately met the Man alone. He chang'd Colour in the reading of it, ſeveral times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the Seal very circumſpectly (but that he ſhou'd have done before he open'd it) tho' the niceſt Obſerver, even he that ſent it, cou'd not have diſcover'd the Letter had been open'd. However, I cou'd find by his odd Queſtions, he was not over-well ſatisfy'd with the Bearer, obſerving my Face, as if he wou'd look me thro'; I began to ſuſpect he might find me
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0201000402:56"/>
out in my Diſguiſe, not being well aſſur'd but he might have ſeen me when I was brought wounded from the Wood, ſenſeleſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at laſt, he began to be a little better compos'd. He took ſome pains to perſuade me to drink ſomething, but I inform'd him I had Buſineſs a little further, therefore was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to return immediately. He then made me promiſe to call as I came back; telling me, he would go along with me to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſent me, to which I agreed, and went on to meet my dear Miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>When I told her the Story of the Letter, ſhe cou'd hardly give Credit to it, believing her intended Raviſher had been in the Regions of Death: But at laſt, being convinc'd he was ſtill living, ſhe reſolv'd not to ſtir abroad, for fear he ſhou'd put his wicked Deſigns in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; deſiring I wou'd do the ſame, tho' I had not inform'd her of my Danger. The Grief we felt at Parting, almoſt overcame us, and it was with ſome Difficulty I cou'd bring my Countenance to diſſemble my Sorrow, when I call'd upon the Innkeeper.</p>
                        <p>After ſtaying ſome time, we ſet out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but I cou'd plainly perceive his Mind was very much diſturb'd. In croſſing a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, we obſerv'd a Kite had pounc'd a poor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0201000402:57"/>
Pidgeon, and flew up into a Tree in our way as we paſs'd. I ran as faſt as I cou'd, and with Stones frighted him from his Prey. The Pidgeon, not quite dead, flutter'd about the Tree, and at laſt fell at our Feet, which I took up. Thus it is, ſaid I, in the World, Power, Rapine, Violence, and Luſt, which ſtop at nothing to compaſs their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, tho' they prey upon Innocence and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet they often meet with their Reward in this World, as well as the next. That Kite that left the innocent Pidgeon in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has every one for its Enemy; while the poor Pidgeon is pity'd. But Birds are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Nature, to what they do; the Kite was compell'd by Hunger and Neceſſity to ſeek his Prey; but vicious Man preys upon his Fellow-Creature out of Wantonneſs or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Your Reflexion, reply'd the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, ſeems ſomething above your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I will freely declare, very much ſurpriſes me; therefore beg the Favour to be anſwer'd one Queſtion, ſincerely. I told him I wou'd. Why then, ſaid he, do you know any thing of the Perſon that gave you the Letter, or any thing relating to the Contents? Or do you know the Gentleman who ſent that Meſſenger? Tho', I muſt own, I abhor an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0201000402:58"/>
Untruth, yet I thought it wou'd not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to declare what I knew; therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd in the Negative. The Man was ſome time before he ſpoke, looking ſtedfaſtly upon me all the while. At laſt he broke Silence, to this Purpoſe: Friend, I know not your Condition, yet do verily believe you are not what you ſeem; but be that as it may, I have in this ſhort Acquaintance, ſuch a ſtrong Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your Wiſdom and Integrity, by your Countenance and Diſcourſe, that I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a very important Secret to you, upon this Condition, that you will never diſcloſe it, give me your Advice, and not endeavour to prejudice me. I reply'd, his Confidence in me, oblig'd me to be his Friend. Come then, ſaid he, let us go out of this Path, for Hedges and Ditches may have Ears, as well as Walls, as the Saying is.</p>
                        <p>When we came to a convenient Place, we ſat down, and he related to me all the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of what I knew before, concerning the Family of my Miſtreſs, and my own Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; how the Wretch who ſent him the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had prevail'd upon him to betray the young Lady, his former Miſtreſs, for 500 <hi>l.</hi> into his Hands, and fly with him into the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where he had a large Eſtate, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0201000402:59"/>
ſhou'd be ſhrouded from the Law. Now, I muſt own, the Money has a prevailing Power, and my Poverty pleads for the Gentleman; beſides, I have a Wife, that has of late giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me Proof how much ſhe ſtrives to ſend me to Heaven, by adorning my Brows. But yet I have a Conſcience for my Monitor, that every Moment tells me, I am about a wicked Deed. And this Letter I have receiv'd, which you was the Bearer of, has ſtagger'd my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; for I find, by the Contents, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Gentleman is to be murder'd, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a noble and a generous Action; therefore, the firſt thing I ſhall deſire of you, before you give me your Advice, is, to promiſe me you will go to ſuch a Place (naming my Uncle's Houſe) and inform the young Gentleman, his Nephew, of the Danger he is in; for tho' I have no Knowledge of him, yet I know his Uncle to be a Perſon who is an Honour to the Habit he wears, and has the Goodwill of every Body. When I had read the Letter, I affected to be very much aſtoniſh'd at ſuch a Deſign, in a Kingdom famous for the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Laws, where ſuch Crimes are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Death, and told him the Danger he run, in ſuch a vile Proceeding; the Uſage he muſt expect from ſuch a Villain, when he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0201000402:60"/>
had him once in his Power, and the Reward might be taken from him, nay, perhaps Death might be his Payment, from ſuch a barbarous Wretch, that he might have the fewer to maintain.</p>
                        <p>He allow'd all I ſaid for Oracles, yet he was ſtill hankering after the 500 <hi>l.</hi> It wou'd be a Piece of Juſtice, cry'd the Innkeeper, even to bite him of it. I cannot deny but it wou'd, I reply'd, but I think that impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. I wiſh we cou'd contrive, reply'd he, to let him run away with my Wife, I then ſhou'd get 500 <hi>l.</hi> and be rid of a baſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that has made me a Cuckold. The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeems to intimate (ſaid I) that you had ſome Scruples in parting with her. That's true, reply'd the Innkeeper, for when he firſt mov'd me about this wicked Buſineſs, I had only a Jealouſy of her Falſhood; but ſince I have prov'd it, I deſpiſe her as much as I lov'd her; yet I have even conceal'd my Knowledge of her Falſhood, tho' I was an Eye-witneſs of it. I began to inquire further into the Affair, and found he had Reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to get rid of his Wife; therefore we ſpent ſome Time in Conference about bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Affair to bear, but cou'd not think of any probable Means. Come, cry'd the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0201000402:61"/>
Innkeeper,, ſince we can't think to any Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, let me intreat you to go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the young Gentleman's Fate. The young Gentleman, ſaid I, is ſafe enough, for to let you into a Secret, in return of yours, I am the very Perſon, in this Diſguiſe.</p>
                        <p>The Innkeeper was Thunder-ſtruck, at what I told him, and ſeem'd willing to be rid of his Companion; but I brought him to himſelf by good Words, and ſome Money which I gave him, as I told him, for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſave my Life. I own, ſaid he, it ſeems a Mark of Providence, in my meeting with you, and therefore I abhor myſelf for my wicked Intention, and ſhall never ſet my Mind at reſt, till I have gain'd Forgiveneſs from Heaven and you. We were interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our farther Diſcourſe, by a Perſon that croſs'd the Meadow with a Fiſhing-Rod in his Hand; tho' he was ſo intent to get over the Hedge, to the River that ran near it, that he ſaw us not. That is, ſaid the Innkeeper, the Villain that has ſeduc'd my Wife! my Blood riſes at him; I have a good mind to run after him, and puſh him into the River. Hold, ſaid I, why did not you ſhew your Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when you caught him in the Act, and revenge yourſelf? Becauſe, ſaid he, my
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0201000402:62"/>
Blood was froze with Horror, and I had not the Power to ſtir. Well then, I reply'd, let him alone now, for I have ſomething in my Head that may be of Service to you, not only to get rid of your Wife, but to fecure the 500 <hi>l.</hi> too. Did your Wife ever receive any Letters from him, to your Knowledge? I believe not, reply'd the Innkeeper, for when he comes a Fiſhing, he generally lies at our Houſe; ſo that they have Opportunities e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, of Converſation, without writing to each other. Why then, ſaid I, contain your ſelf a little; go to the Angler, and tell him your Wife has betray'd herſelf to you, and forbid him your Houſe. Or if you don't like that Method, take any other to prevent his coming to your Habitation; but don't uſe any indirect Means. Well, reply'd my Hoſt, I'll take your Advice about the Calmneſs of my Mind; tho' I ſhan't proceed in the other Affair, quite according to your Direction, for I think, after owning myſelf a Cuckold to my Cuckold-maker, nothing ſhou'd follow but his Deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>I ſtaid about half an Hour, inly rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon my unhappy Condition, before he return'd. I have don't, cry'd my Hoſt, I believe he won't come to my Houſe in haſte.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0201000402:63"/>
I hope you have not murder'd him, ſaid I? No, no, I proceeded in another manner. By reading a Letter he careleſly dropt once, I found he ow'd a conſiderable Sum of Money to a certain Perſon in <hi>London,</hi> who threaten'd to trouble him. Remembring the Perſon's Name, I went up to him as he was Fiſhing, and told him, I was glad I had met with him, for there were Officers to arreſt him at our Houſe, at the Suit of ſuch-a-one. He ſeem'd ſurpris'd, as not doubting the Truth; and begg'd I wou'd ſtand his Friend in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment; therefore I have ſent him to a Couſin of mine, that keeps an Inn about Ten Miles off, with a Promiſe to come and inform him when the Officers are gone. You have done well, ſaid I; and now I'll inform you of my Deſign.</p>
                        <p>You ſhall write a Letter, in anſwer to that I brought you; where you ſhall mention, that you ſhall have the Lady in your Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ready for him to take her away to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The Letter I will indite for you, which you ſhall tranſcribe. And then I'll write another, as from the Angler to your Wife, to tell her that you have diſcover'd your Jealouſy to him, and forbid him your Houſe; but that, if ſhe conſent to fly with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0201000402:64"/>
him to-morrow Night, he will come, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome Friends, and bring her to a Place of Safety. Very well, reply'd my Companion, I underſtand you; and ſo put my Wife upon the Gentleman, inſtead of the Lady! a rare Contrivance, if it ſucceeds. Come, ſaid I, let us go to a Houſe, and write the Letters, that we may loſe no Time. I wrote to the Villain, that does not deſerve the Name of Man, in this manner:

                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0201000402:66"/>Right ſtill, cry'd my Hoſt. But who will be the Bearer? I told him, I wou'd carry it myſelf; while he went on to the maim'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that brought the Letter, and ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, hurt as he was, to his Maſter. We a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to part, but I promis'd him I would come after him, and conſult farther.</p>
                        <p>When I arriv'd at my Hoſt's, I found his Wife trick'd up like a Dutcheſs; and, to give her her Due, ſhe ſeem'd an agreeable Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. She took the Letter, with ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which ſomething alarm'd me, for fear ſhe might know his Hand. She went into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Room, and return'd immediately with a Bottle of Wine, and a cold Chicken, and put Half a Guinea into my Hand. Friend, ſaid ſhe, if my Husband ſhou'd come and catch you, and ſuſpect, there's Money to pay your Reckoning; if not, it is to pay you for your Trouble. I thank'd her as much like a Countryman, as I cou'd. Upon which ſhe went out, and ſtaid ſome time. When ſhe return'd, ſhe gave me a Letter. Give that, ſaid ſhe, with my humble Service to the Perſon that ſent you, and tell him, It's very well.</p>
                        <p>When I had got my Commiſſion, I made what Haſte I cou'd to my Landlord, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0201000402:67"/>
found him helping up the Countryman upon his Horſe, and the Surgeon curſing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Folly of the Fellow, to get on Horſeback in that Condition. However, go he muſt, the Fellow ſaid, if he dy'd by the Way. But the Man of the Houſe ſent one to attend him to his Maſter's, and we ſtaid till the Fellow return'd, which he did in three Hours, telling his Maſter, he had conducted him ſafe home. In the mean time we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Letter I brought from my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Landlay; which was to this Effect; <hi>That ſhe wou'd fly to the World's End with him, and live upon Roots and Water, to enjoy his ſweet Company, and leave that deſpicable Wretch her Husband, whom ſhe loath'd as much as ſhe lov'd him,</hi> &amp;c. A brave Wife, by my Troth! cry'd my Landlord.</p>
                        <p>When I gave him the Half-Guinea ſhe made me a Preſent of, he ſaid, it was well there were not real Bailiffs at his Houſe for Mr. Angler; for his Wife, by her extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bounty to the Letter-Carrier, wou'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly pay her Lover's Debts, if ſhe cou'd any way raiſe the Money. My Thoughts now began to return homeward; but my Companion told me, he wou'd not leave me, till he ſaw me ſafe at my Uncle's, for fear the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0201000402:68"/>
Wretches ſhou'd diſcover me. I thank'd him, and accepted of his Company, becauſe I was to ſhift my Diſguiſe by the way, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might be murder'd in going from thence to my Uncle's, for he knew not of my Transformation; neither ſhou'd I have gone home till our Deſigns had been accompliſh'd, if it had not been that my Uncle wou'd have been frighten'd at my Abſence. Therefore we agreed to go both together, and my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to lodge in the Neighbourhood of my Uncle, and both return the next Day to wait the Iſſue of our Project.</p>
                        <p>When we came to the Houſe where I was to dreſs, the Perſon told me, there were three Men had been with him, to know where my Uncle liv'd; and ask'd ſeveral Queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me; but, ſaid he, I did not like their Turn of Diſcourſe, therefore gave 'em no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, ſo they proceeded on their way. I told him, he had acted wiſely, for they were Wretches that had a Deſign upon my Life. If ſo, ſaid he, looking out, be upon your Guard, for here they come, up the Lane. I had not pull'd off my Diſguiſe, therefore ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd out of the Door, keeping my Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Brace of Pocket-Piſtols I always carry'd about me, ſince my Rencounter with that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0201000402:69"/>
Wretch; one of 'em rid up to me, and ask'd me, if I had ſeen Mr. Such-a-one? naming my Name. Mr. <hi>Clerimont!</hi> ſaid I, ſpeaking in a Country Manner, yes, he'll be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; I wait for him, by his own Order. I am glad on't, reply'd the Fellow, for I have ſome earneſt Buſineſs to communicate to him, and was inform'd at his Uncle's, that he had not been at home ſince Morning; therefore, with your Leave, we'll wait here till he comes. With all my Heart, ſaid I; if you pleaſe, you may alight, and put up your Horſes. No, reply'd the Fellow, our Horſes are hot, therefore we'll ride ſoftly up and down to cool 'em; and when he arrives, if you'll come and acquaint us, I'll give thee ſomething. Thank ye, Maſter, ſaid I; I'll be ſure to do it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they rode off. I watch'd 'em ſome time, and found they were very buſy in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation. In the mean time, I inſtructed the Man of the Houſe to go to the Conſtable, and bring a ſufficient Force along with him. But before he went out, they all three return'd, and alighting from their Horſes, they deſir'd I wou'd put 'em into the Stable, for they were now cool; telling me, they would accept of my Offer, and wait there till Mr. <hi>Clerimont</hi> came. Well, Gentlemen, ſaid I, for his ſake,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0201000402:70"/>
you ſhall be welcome to what the Houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. Come, ſit down. The Fellows ſeem'd a little ſhy; however, they ſat down at laſt, and began to be very free with the Liquor we gave 'em; and we ply'd 'em ſo cloſe, that in two Hours, we did not want the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's Aſſiſtance to ſecure 'em, for they were all three drunk to a Degree.</p>
                        <p>When the Conſtable came, I order'd him to keep out of Sight, till I ſent for him. I began then to examine the ſobereſt of 'em, asking him, what Buſineſs he had with Mr. <hi>Clerimont?</hi> Not, ſaid I, but if I look into your Hand, I need not ask the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for I am ſo skill'd in Palmiſtry, that I can tell things paſt, preſent, and to come; that is to ſay, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> reply'd the Man, you are a Conjuror. However, to try your Skill, there's my Hand, do your beſt, and ſpare not. This Hand, ſaid I, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in part, or will receive ſhortly, the Price of innocent Blood. The Man, drunk as he was, ſeem'd to be in the utmoſt Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet endeavour'd to hide it, by pulling back his Hand. It is in vain to conceal it from me, ſaid I; you, and your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, are hir'd to murder that <hi>Clerimont</hi> you ſo earneſtly enquire for, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0201000402:71"/>
is now in the Houſe to apprehend you.</p>
                        <p>This, ſpoke with a confident Air, made him turn pale; for his other two Companions were faſt aſleep. But ſtill, he put it off as a Jeſt, till I call'd in the Conſtable. Here, Conſtable, ſaid I, take theſe three Rogues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cuſtody, and ſee 'em well ſecur'd till to-morrow. They came here with an Intention to murder me, I having ſufficient Witneſſes to prove it againſt them. And are you that <hi>Clerimont?</hi> cry'd the Fellow I had been talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to. Yes, ſaid I. Now let me know what is your Buſineſs with me. Turn every body out of the Chamber, reply'd he, and I will convince you, we had no ſuch Intention. I told him, I thought it was impoſſible. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after ſearching 'em for Arms, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, I order'd the Room to be clear'd. Sir, ſaid the Man, how you got your Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, is a very great Myſtery to me; but we three were certainly ſent from ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to murder you, for the Reward of 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Man; and after we had made an end of you, we were to imbark with him for the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> We receiv'd 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Man, as Earneſt of the reſt, but reſolv'd not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo barbarous an Act upon the Innocent;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0201000402:72"/>
therefore we intended to acquaint you with the real Truth, hoping you would cauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be ſpread of your Murder, about your Neighbourhood, for a few Days, till we had receiv'd the Reward, and our Maſter had imbark'd. I own, you may hardly find Faith to believe me; but it is Truth, as I hope for Heaven. You may perceive we have no Arms about us; and if you pleaſe to examine our Piſtols, at our Holſters, you will find they are as empty as my Maſter's Heart is of Humanity.</p>
                        <p>I immediately ſent to examine their Piſtols, and found 'em uncharg'd, as he declar'd. This Proof gain'd on my Belief. Well, Sir, ſaid the Man, I hope you think what I have ſaid is Truth. But the more to ſtrengthen it, Pray awake my Companions, and examine them. Now what Diſcourſe we had together, was ſpoke ſo low, that if the other two Men had been awake, and ſober, they cou'd not have underſtood us. Therefore I caus'd 'em to be rous'd from their drouſy Humour, while I went and put on my own Cloaths. When I came in, I order'd the Perſon I had been talking with, to tell 'em he had ſeen me. Well, and have you broke the Matter to him? ſaid one of 'em. Yes, he reply'd, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0201000402:73"/>
I do intend to comply with his Requeſt. We are glad on't (return'd the other two) then our Fourſcore Pounds apiece is all ſnug. I found, upon a further Examination, the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows were honeſt: Nay, one of 'em told me, it was not altogether the Lucre of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that prevail'd upon him, but to ſave an innocent Gentleman's Life; for, ſaid he, if we had not undertaken it, ſome others might, that wou'd have gone through with their Work.</p>
                        <p>The Difficulty I now labour'd under, was which way to cauſe the Report of my Death, without alarming my Uncle; therefore took this Method, which was approv'd of by the three Men. I put on my Diſguiſe once more, and gave 'em the Cloaths I put off, which we mangled and blooded in ſeveral Places, and order'd 'em to tell the Wretch who ſent 'em, that they found me hunting in a Wood alone, and there murder'd me, and the Place being private, not likely for any one to find me immediately, they had ſtript me, and brought my Cloaths as a Proof that my Buſineſs was done effectually. They all three gave me many Thanks, and promis'd me, in a few Days, to let me know their Succeſs, for they were reſolv'd to leave their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0201000402:74"/>
Maſter ſecretly, as ſoon as ever they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their Reward, not caring to live any longer with ſuch a barbarous Wretch. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, we parted, and my Hoſt and I went to our Repoſe. The next Morning, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd mine Hoſt to regulate Matters with my hated Rival, and deſign'd to follow. I told my Uncle, I intended to go ſee a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about Twenty Miles off, and ſhou'd not return till the next Day; for I did not think it proper to acquaint him with the Motive of my Journey. I went in my uſual Diſguiſe, but durſt not go to the Landlord's Houſe, becauſe his Wife wou'd know me for the Letter-Carrier; therefore choſe to ride into a neighbouring Wood, till it was dark, where I entertain'd myſelf with a Book I brought along with me. But I was very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, an Hour before Night, to ſee the Wretch, and two more along with him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame Wood. I began to have ſome dreadful Apprehenſion, for fear they ſhou'd find me out, therefore leading my Horſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Wood, and tying him faſt, fetch'd a Round, and came almoſt at their Backs; yet tho' I was ſo near 'em, they cou'd not come to me immediately, by reaſon of the Interpoſition of a thick Copſe of Hazels,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0201000402:75"/>
which kept me from their Sight. Now my Revenge is ſatisfy'd (cry'd the Villain) my Heart feels lighter, and it looks like an Omen of future Contentment, in poſſeſſing that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Maid. I muſt own, I do love her, and wou'd wait a Year with Patience, if at the end ſhe wou'd reward my Love.</p>
                        <p>You were very patient (reply'd another) when, not long ſince, you attempted to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh her, and no doubt, had don't, if the Perſon who has paid his Life for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, had not prevented it. 'Tis true, reply'd the Barbarian, the firſt Fire of my Paſſion, I own, was the Flame of Luſt; but I now begin to fanſy, if I cou'd gain her Heart, I ſhou'd revel in Bliſs, for a whole Year at leaſt, without being cloy'd. But how tedious do the Moments paſs, continu'd the Villain! Oh, how I long for Night! How will the trembling Slut be bit, when, inſtead of flying to the Man ſhe loves, ſhe'll find herſelf in the Embraces of one ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts! This Wood will once more be the Bawd to my Deſigns. As ſoon as ever we have left the Shore, I'll proceed to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſcornful Dame.</p>
                        <p>I muſt own, this Declaration made me ſhudder; and I had once reſolv'd to draw my
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0201000402:76"/>
Piſtols, and ſhoot the Villain thro' the Head, if the Conſideration of our Project had not hinder'd me. I waited, with as much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience as my Rival did, till the Moment came of our Decampment. As ſoon as they were mounted, I took Horſe, and follow'd; but my Horſe hearing other Horſes before him, neigh'd ſeveral times, which caus'd my Leaders to ſtop; however, as there was but two, and I in my Diſguiſe, I reſolv'd to puſh on, and come up with 'em. As I came even with the Wretch and his Companion, they ask'd me where I was going? I told 'em, to ſuch an Inn; naming the Place where they were bound. This Fellow, ſaid the Ruffian, may hinder our Deſign, therefore we muſt prevent him; tho' this was ſpoke in a Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet I heard it plain, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of my Forwardneſs in following them; I therefore put Spurs to my Horſe to get out of their Reach.</p>
                        <p>Hold, hold! cry'd the Maſter, not ſo faſt, I want to ſpeak with you; I have a Job for you to do, which I'll pay you well for; 'tis only to go to the Harbour, which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three Miles off, and inquire for the <hi>Speedwell Galley,</hi> that lies moor'd to the Wharf; bid 'em immediately unmoor, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0201000402:77"/>
prepare for Sailing, and ſend the Boat aſhore to wait my Coming, which won't be above two Hours; if thou wilt do this, there's a Crown; and if you'll wait till I come, I'll give thee another. Thank you, Maſter, ſaid I, with all my Heart, if your Worſhip will beſpeak a Bed for me at the Inn, as you paſs by. Ay, that I will, reply'd the Wretch, and a good Supper beſide. I gave him Thanks, turn'd my Horſe's Head to go back again, and reſolv'd to do as he deſired; for then I ſhou'd ſee the End of our Project.</p>
                        <p>When I came to the Harbour, I found the Boat's Crew aſhore, waiting for their Maſter. When I had executed my Commiſſion, the Coxen cry'd, What, is the Devil in my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Does he think my Memory ſo ſhort, that I ſhou'd forget his Orders in five Hours? I fanſy ſo, ſaid I, for he paid me well for my Journey; and yet but in part, for I am to ſtay till he returns, for the reſt of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I think the open Air is a little too cold, to ſtay in't three or four Hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore, if you'll go with me to an Alehouſe, I'll ſpend part of my Wages upon you. A few Words ſtruck up the Bargain, and away we went.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0201000402:78"/>When the Company were pretty well warm'd with their Liquor, I began to ask 'em a few Queſtions concerning their Maſter, intimating, that we had been in Treaty about my entring into his Service. Why, reply'd the Coxen, you had better <hi>ſtand ſtill, and walk Horſes,</hi> as the Saying is. I own he's good at Promiſing, but the worſt at Performing, I believe, in the whole Dominions of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> How comes it to paſs then, ſaid I, that you'll ſerve ſuch a ſcurvy Maſter? Why you know, Maſter, reply'd the Coxen, we Sailors are very blunt honeſt Fellows, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I believe it is not in your Power to hurt me, I'll tell you the Truth. We are all marry'd, or have Settlements, upon his Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> therefore 'tis our Intereſts; and as he brought us out with him, we muſt wink at his Rogueries, that he may carry us to our own Plantations again; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I'd leave him this Inſtant; for I dare ſwear, he's upon ſome ill Deſign this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In return to your Confidence of me, I reply'd, I can aſſure you 'tis ſo; nay, and ſuch an Action, that not only may endanger his Life, but the Lives of thoſe that aſſiſt him in't. Upon this, all the Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look upon one another, with Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0201000402:79"/>
full of Fear. 'Sblood! if I thought that, cry'd one, the Devil might aſſiſt him, for me. Some baudy Buſineſs, cry'd another, I ſuppoſe; I don't care to hazard my Life for any Whore, but my own. I'd venture my Life, ſaid another, in an Engagement, in hopes of Plunder; but I'll ſee him d—'d before I'll have any thing to do with his dirty Work.</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, every Sailor had ſomething to ſay upon the Occaſion; and I found, by their Sentiments, they were all honeſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or ſeem'd ſo; and the more they drank, the more they ſeem'd reſolv'd to oppoſe him in any ill Deſign. I let 'em into ſome part of the Story, in order that they ſhou'd ſtand the poor Wretch's Friend, that by Miſtake might be brought among 'em; for I did not doubt, but when he found out the Trick that was put upon him, his Brutality and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment wou'd puſh him on to murder the Woman. This was the only Motive that induc'd me to enter into Converſation with 'em; therefore, I intended to take my Leave, but was prevented by a loud Knocking at the Door. Immediately after, enter'd the Wretch, ſwearing abominably at the Coxen, and Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, in not being at the Boat to wait his Coming.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0201000402:80"/>The Sailors began to grumble, and told him, they were not his Slaves, nor wou'd be us'd as ſuch. I don't know where this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute wou'd have ended, if the three Fellows that were hired to murder me, had not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their Maſter, and deſir'd to ſpeak with him in private. What is it you want with me, you troubleſome Vermin? cry'd the Brute. You know what we want, reply'd one of them; and therefore we expect to be ſatisfy'd before you go on Board: You know very well, we were to have the Reward when our Buſineſs was finiſh'd; and not keeping your Word with us, makes us imagine you intend to forget the reſt of the Money, if we don't put you in mind of it. You Villains, cry'd out their Maſter, if you mention one Word more of that Affair, look to yourſelves! you know, you good-for-nothing Raſcals, that it is in my Power to hang you all; therefore no more Words, or an Halter ſhall be your Reward; you have been too well paid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. A Halter our Reward! cry'd the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and what ſhou'd be his Reward, that put us upon ſuch an Action? Why, you Caitiffs, you know very well (cry'd their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) I only order'd you to Baſtinado the Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, not to murder him: And, you Clods!
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0201000402:81"/>
if I had Time to ſtay, I wou'd find out Means to help you to the Gallows. Come, Rogues (ſaid he to the Sailors) and fly to the Boat this Inſtant. Better Words, cry'd the Sailors, or you ſhall to Sea by your ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Zounds! we know you can't do without us, and therefore we'll be better treated; and tho' moſt of your Governors of Plantations are bad enough, yet there's one gone to take your Place, that we may expect Juſtice from, without paying for't. What the Devil! I ſuppoſe there's a Conſpiracy in my Abſence, reply'd the <hi>quondam</hi> Governor: Who has put Rebellion into your Heads? not you, my honeſt Friend, I hope? ſpeaking to me. The three Fellows not obſerving me before, ſeem'd very much ſurpriz'd at the Sight of me, and one of 'em cry'd out in a Tranſport, Good God! Mr. <hi>Clermont,</hi> what brought you here? Ha! <hi>Clermont,</hi> ſaid the Wretch, is the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain then living ſtill? I own I was very much ſurpris'd at this Diſcovery, but was brought out of it by his furious Approach, with his drawn Hanger in his Hand; however, I had Preſence of Mind to pull my Piſtols out of my Pocket, and aim'd one at his Breaſt, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, if he offer'd to come one Step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, I'd ſhoot him dead at my Feet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0201000402:82"/>The Sight of my Piſtols made him ſtop ſhort, and call to his Men to ſeize me; ſome of 'em, not thinking what they did, were going to obey his Orders. Gentlemen, ſaid I, hear me two Words, and I'll deliver my ſelf into your Hands: Upon ſaying this, they ſtopt, and I inform'd 'em, in ſhort, of their Maſter's implacable Hatred to me. When they had heard my Story, they one and all cry'd out, they wou'd ſtand by me with their Lives. Upon this, he ſullenly ſat down, and was ſome time before he open'd his Mouth. A general Silence follow'd; but our Eyes were buſy, looking at each other. At laſt he open'd in this manner: Sir, can you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me for my paſt black Deſigns againſt your Life? I own, this Contrition, at this Exigence, looks like Falſhood; but upon the Word of a Man of Honour, I repent from the Bottom of my Heart, of all my baſe Actions; when I look back on 'em, it is with Horror! How amiable a Figure do you make, cloath'd in Innocence and Virtue! And how like a Fiend of Hell do I look, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with ſuch hateful Crimes! but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I hope, may waſh my Stains away; and I ſhall think I am in the firſt Road to Virtue, if you'll vouchſafe me your Pardon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0201000402:83"/>
and Friendſhip: My Servants, that I find have ſav'd your innocent Life, ſhall receive the Reward they expected, for the Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that their Maſter wanted: My Seamen ſhall find me, for the future, ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander as they can wiſh for; and when we arrive in our own Country, their Reward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſhall exceed their Expectation.</p>
                        <p>Very well, reply'd the Coxen, half drunk, I have heard your Worſhip talk at this rate, before now. Ay, ay, cry'd another, we know his Tongue is well hung, he promiſes as well as e'er a Gentleman in the Univerſe, and performs as ill. I muſt confeſs (ſaid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Raviſher) the Character my own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants give me, is enough to ſtartle a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: But what other Motive, but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can make me declare myſelf in this manner? I find myſelf a new Man, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wonder at my former Self. All the while this Diſpute laſted, I was inly ruminating how I ſhou'd proceed. I was in very great doubt of his Sincerity; for I obſerv'd, in all his Diſcourſe, he turn'd his Eye very often upon the Door, as if he expected ſome of his Men from the Ship to take his Part; at leaſt I thought ſo. Beſide, I wanted very much to confer with my Landlord, who I knew
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0201000402:84"/>
wou'd accompany his Wife, tho' unknown to her: therefore I told him, I would go out to recompoſe my Spirits, and return immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again. Very well, he reply'd, you are at your own Liberty, and it will be my utmoſt Wiſh, that when you come back, you will forgive one that will ever think it his higheſt Happineſs to be eſteem'd your Friend. I made him no Reply, but went out, and found my Landlord, who was waiting at the Door, with four or five more, all in Diſguiſe, and mask'd, attending his good Wife, who ſeem'd very impatient. I told him what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd; and ask'd him Advice how I ſhould behave myſelf. Damn him (he reply'd) don't truſt him, for if you do, he'll certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you. But, however, conceal yourſelf ſomewhere about the Houſe, till I go in and feel his Pulſe; for I muſt get rid of Madam, ſome how.</p>
                        <p>I conſented to his going in, for I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was the only way to try his Sincerity; for if he really repented, he would reſtore his pretended Lady to her Liberty. Therefore I retired to wait the Event. However, upon ſecond Thoughts, I judg'd it the ſafeſt Courſe to get my Horſe ready, for fear of things. Juſt as I was leading him out of the Stable,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0201000402:85"/>
I perceiv'd my Landlord and the Gentleman coming towards me, and, I muſt confeſs, did not know what to think of it; but they ſtopt, as ſoon as they were got out of hearing of the People about the Door. Why it is a terrible Buſineſs, I own (ſaid my Landlord) to be diſappointed in your Revenge, for I'll engage he's two Miles off, by this time; for he mounted immediately, and flew away like Lightning. Damn him! reply'd my falſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, I wiſh his Horſe may break his Neck. Not impoſſible, cry'd my Landlord: But ſince he's gone, let's proceed to Buſineſs. Your Men, you may depend on't, will ſoon return to their Duty, now Mr. <hi>Clermont</hi> has left 'em. Therefore, give me my Reward, and I wiſh you Luck, and a boon Voyage. There it is (putting a Purſe in his Hand) all in Gold. I hope your Worſhip (reply'd my Landlord) has not put a Trick upon me? No, on my Word, return'd the Villain, you are the only one I intend not to deceive; and if you'll ſend me Word you have murder'd <hi>Clermont,</hi> I'll ſend thee the next Return after it, a hundred Hogſheads of the beſt Sugar in my Plantations. My Thoughts were very much confus'd before, but in hearing this, I forgot all Patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I drew a Piſtol from my
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0201000402:86"/>
Pocket, and running up, cry'd, No, Villain, Heaven has reſerv'd me to puniſh ſuch a mortal Devil as thou art. I diſcharg'd my Piſtol at his Head; and, ſeeing him fall, mounted my Horſe, and flew away like Lightning, in earneſt. I rid ſix or ſeven Miles before my troubled Thoughts return'd to Reaſon; and then, when I began to think, I condemn'd myſelf for being ſo raſh; and thought of the Crime I had committed, in killing a Wretch with all his Sins about him.</p>
                        <p>I did not go home that Night; neither ſhould I have thought of repoſing myſelf, if my Horſe had not put me in mind of it, by ſeeming jaded; but being far from any Houſe, I drove him into a Meadow, and ſat under a Hedge till Break of Day. When I got home, my good Uncle ſaw viſibly the Diſcontent was increas'd in my Countenance; but I wou'd not wound his Peace farther, by telling him what had befallen me; I only feign'd ſome ſlight Indiſpoſition, therefore ſtaid at home three or four Days, but under terrible Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and what increas'd my Apprehenſions, I heard nothing from my Miſtreſs for ſeveral Days beyond the uſual Time. The only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation was, that no Intelligence came con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0201000402:87"/>
the Death of the Wretch I ſuppos'd I had kill'd; for I was well aſſur'd, if I had been call'd to an Account for it, the fatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry wou'd have broke the Heart of my pious Uncle.</p>
                        <p>I was almoſt afraid to go to my Landlord's (as I call'd him) tho' I had no Reaſon to doubt his Honeſty; and wonder'd I had not ſeen him in ſo many Days. Therefore, after many Irreſolutions, I ventur'd to viſit him in my Diſguiſe as uſual. When I came to his Houſe, they told me he was ill of a Fever. I ask'd a Countryman that was drinking at the Door, concerning him. I don't know, ſays the Countryman, the Man's a Fool, I think; he takes it much in Dudgeon, that his Wife has made him a Cuckold; and you know, Sir, it's many an honeſt Man's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Now I think, he has Reaſon to be out of his Wits with Joy, that he has got rid of a deviliſh Wife. By this Fellow's Diſcourſe, I underſtood every thing had ſucceeded to his Wiſh; but I trembled to think in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I fear'd he might have murder'd her, to break his Marriage Bonds, and was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy to know the Truth. While the Fellow and I were talking, a Maid-Servant came to me, and ask'd me, if I was not the Perſon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0201000402:88"/>
that brought a Letter to her Maſter ſome time ago? I was ſomething ſurpris'd at the Queſtion, and did not readily give her an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. If you are the ſame Perſon, ſaid ſhe, (perceiving I ſaid nothing) you need not be afraid; my Maſter only order'd me to bring you up Stairs, if you ſhould come here at any time. I follow'd her to her Maſter's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without opening my Lips. I found him on his Bed, and ſeemingly very weak. When the Door was ſhut, he aroſe.</p>
                        <p>Well Sir, ſaid he, my Ends are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, tho' in ſuch a manner, that has given me very great Uneaſineſs; for, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had all the Reaſon in the World to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe my Wife, yet her deplorable End, tho' it ſhews the Judgment of the Almighty upon wicked Perſons, has caſt me into ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Melancholy, that I believe I ſhall never ſhake it off. When you, Sir, fired your Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol at the baſe Villain that deſerves the worſt of Deaths, the Report frighted the Horſe my Wife rode on, to ſuch a Degree, that he ran away with her, and plunging into the Sea, threw her off. We try'd all Means to ſave her, but ſhe ſunk to the Bottom, and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſaw her. It was ſuppos'd the Tide of Ebb carry'd her into the main Ocean.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0201000402:89"/>
Well, but Landlord, ſaid I, how did you proceed with the Men, after the Villain was kill'd? Alas, Sir! reply'd my Landlord, you was not ſo lucky to make an end of him; for one of the Balls only graz'd upon the Top of his Forehead; and it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but the other might wound the Horſe my Wife rode on, which made him ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous.</p>
                        <p>When the Wretch got up again, and found the Smallneſs of his Hurt, he was for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing you; but was prevented by the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Accident of my Wife. He mourn'd very much the Loſs of his Miſtreſs, as he thought; and I own it was ſome good Luck to me, that ſhe was not diſcover'd to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for he is of ſuch an implacable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I don't know how far his Revenge might have carry'd him; for after we had try'd in vain to find out the unfortunate Wretch, he was ſtill upon a Project of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an end of you; but I wrought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Belief that I wou'd certainly do it for him, that he gave me Twenty Guineas for the Job, as he call'd it. His Men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, grumbled much; but the three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that were hired to murder you, would not be prevail'd upon to go on Board, till he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0201000402:90"/>
had ſatisfy'd 'em according to his Promiſe. He made many Excuſes, telling 'em, he had not Money enough about him; at laſt, he gave 'em Twenty Guineas a-piece, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd 'em he would give 'em the reſt, when he had them on Board. But, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fair Promiſes, when their Horſes were embark'd, and every thing ready to go off with the Boat, the three Men were no where to be found. They ſearch'd in vain for ſome time, and were oblig'd to ſet Sail without them. I ſuppoſe his Uneaſineſs was, for fear they ſhou'd diſcover his damnable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the Ship was out of Harbour, I got upon my Horſe, and came home; but was very much ſurpris'd to find the Horſe, that run away with my Wife into the Sea, and ſuppos'd to be drown'd, at home before me. All this is what I wanted to declare to you, and wou'd have waited on you, but my Melancholy and Indiſpoſition prevented me.</p>
                        <p>I told him he ought to conſider, that a bad Wife was a good thing to get rid of; and, tho' I was as much concern'd for the Manner of it, as he cou'd be, yet it was very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when the Villain had found out the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0201000402:91"/>
Trick that was put upon him, but his Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would have drove him to give her the ſame Death, or an Uſage worſe than Death. I own it, reply'd my Landlord, and ſince it ſeems to be the Hand of Heaven, I ought to be ſatisfy'd; but even what I have gain'd by it, ſeems at preſent to give me very little Contentment; and I ſhould have been willing to have forgiven her, if I thought ſhe could have return'd to her Duty; but I hope Time will wipe off this Score of Melancholy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I can be of any Service to you in your Amour, you may freely command me.</p>
                        <p>I was very much rejoic'd at this kind Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and told him, it was the only thing he could oblige me in, ſince I knew he had the Liberty of going to the Houſe of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, unſuſpected; I therefore freely declar'd to him the whole Progreſs of my Love, and the Uneaſineſs I was in for not hearing from my Fair One. Well, ſaid he, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Weakneſs, if you'll give me a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Credence, I'll promiſe you an Anſwer to-morrow; and I ſhall think I am doing a good Work, in endeavouring to join two Bodies, whoſe Souls are united in Heaven. I was in ſuch a Tranſport at his Manner of Speaking, that I embrac'd him with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0201000402:92"/>
of a ſincere Friend, as indeed, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prov'd himſelf ſuch a one to me; and I think ſincerely, in ſuch low-born Souls, ſuch Honeſty is almoſt a Miracle. I ſat my ſelf down immediately to write to my dear <hi>Eliza.</hi>

He took my Letter, and aſſur'd me he would bring me ſome Anſwer, if he ventur'd his Life for it. I took my Leave of him, and reſolv'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the next Day, in hope of a favourable Anſwer. When I offer'd to reward him for the Trouble he was undertaking, he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refus'd it, and was almoſt angry with me for propoſing any ſuch thing. No, ſaid he, be aſſur'd I am no mercenary Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and tho' I have tranſacted an Affair with that Wretch, that looks like Guilt, I will never, while I live, harbour a mean Thought, but hope to convince you, that a Perſon without Birth or Education, can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Virtue, as well as thoſe who have that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of us.</p>

                        <p>The Reading of this Letter, I muſt own, very much alarm'd me. Now, ſaid my Landlord, I will relate the Hiſtory of my Journey. When I came to <hi>Eliza</hi>'s Father's Houſe, whoſe Servant I was, and whoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I am, I went with the Pretence of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his Rent, tho' not due this Week; but gueſs my Surprize, when, as ſoon as I enter'd, I ſaw that execrable Villain, the Captain, walking in the Garden with my old Maſter. I knew it was not my Buſineſs to be ſeen by him, tho' I was then ignorant of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0201000402:96"/>
the Affair related in the Letter from Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi>; therefore watching them, till they came into the Houſe, I went into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a back Way, to conſider, as well as my troubled Thoughts would let me, what I ſhould do. The Reſpect I had for you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my Returning without delivering your Letter, tho' I knew I ſtaid in the Mouth of Danger. While I was beating my Brains to no Purpoſe, I ſaw my young Miſtreſs <hi>Eliza</hi> come into the Garden, overwhelm'd with Sorrow. I took my Opportunity to ſpeak with her, and gave her your Letter, which ſhe receiv'd with the utmoſt Joy.</p>
                        <p>She inform'd me that the Wretch, the Captain, had been there three Days, and her Father was ſo much rejoic'd to find him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, that by report was thought dead, that he reſolv'd to force her to be his Wife, in a few Days; but ſhe bid me aſſure you, ſhe would ſooner lay violent Hands upon herſelf, than ever conſent to give her Hand to ſuch a Monſter of Mankind. We had not time for much Converſation, for that Moment her Father ſent for her in; ſhe only took the Opportunity of writing with my Pencil upon the blank Leaf of your Letter, that Line I brought you. Immediately after, I ſaw 'em
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0201000402:97"/>
all three come into the Garden, ſo thought it high time to make the beſt of my way.</p>

                        <p>This Letter we convey'd to him the ſame Evening, and follow'd the Meſſenger, as imagining he might take Horſe immediately. I let my Landlord into my manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and order'd him to retire, as ſoon as he ſhou'd ſee the Wretch appear, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction on him, if I ſhou'd be kill'd to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me as privately as poſſible, and let my Uncle have a Letter I had wrote to him, wherein I had inform'd him of every thing that happen'd to the preſent Moment.</p>
                        <p>Our Letter had the deſired Effect; for at the Dusk of the Evening, my Landlord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me the Groom was getting his Horſe ready, and he found he intended to go alone, according to the Purport of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore, full of the Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, I rid on about two Miles before,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0201000402:99"/>
where I waited for him upon an open Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that lay in his way. I never gave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Time to think, all this while, what might be the Conſequence of ſuch an Action. In a Quarter of an Hour, I ſaw him enter the Common. I rid up to him, and bid him ſtop. At my manner of Proceeding, he took me for a Highwayman, for he told me very calmly, he had nothing about him worth my venturing my Life for. No, Wretch, ſaid I, I come for thy Blood, who has often endeavour'd to ſpill that of the unhappy <hi>Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. Clerimont!</hi> cry'd he, in a Tranſport, the only Man I wiſh'd to have met with; and tho' I have an Affair of Conſequence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Hands, yet I will ſtay to put an end to thy deteſtable Life. I had no time to ask him what Arms he carry'd, not intending to take any Advantage of him; for as ſoon as he had done ſpeaking, he fir'd a Piſtol at me; it was ſo well aim'd, that I heard the Balls whiſtle thro' my Hair. I was not long behind him, but return'd him one in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, that ſhot his Horſe ſtone dead; the ſudden Fall of his Horſe, prevented his get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting clear of the Beaſt; therefore I alighted from mine, and diſengag'd him from him. Tho' ſuch impious Villains deſerve no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,

ſaid I, yet I can never forget I am a Gentleman. He made me no Reply, but drawing his Hanger, ran furiouſly upon me, aiming a Blow at my Head, that would have ended all my Misfortunes, if I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it on my left Arm. I found the Stroke had wounded me very much, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cou'd redouble his Blow, I ſhot him thro' the Head; he gave a Groan, fell down, and expir'd.</p>
                        <p>I had then loſt all my Reſentment, and ran to help him up; but I found the Top of his Skull ſhot away, and his Brains upon the Ground; for tho' it was Night, the Moon was up, and I cou'd not help ſtanding in a fixt Poſture, to view the horrid Act (as it was then repreſented to my Fancy) my Hand had done. But my friendly Landlord rous'd me from my Thoughts, that I might take care of my Safety, for he told me, he heard the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping of Horſes in the Lane that led to the Common, the way we came; therefore we mounted our Horſes, and rid away, he lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a full Speed, and I following, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Apprehenſions. We learnt afterwards, the Horſes we heard were the Father of my Miſtreſs, and ſeveral Servants, who follow'd the unfortunate Wretch, as imagining ſome extraordinary Buſineſs, by the Change of his Countenance, when he read the Letter I ſent him. They took up the Body, and bury'd him privately in the Chapel, that very Night. Searching him, they found the Letter that was the Cauſe of his ſudden Departure; and tho' I had diſguis'd my Hand, yet my dear <hi>Eliza</hi> gueſs'd the Letter came from me, and that Imagination gave her inſupportable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs.</p>
                        <p>The next Day her Father, with all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, rid to the Port, to examine concerning the Affair; and <hi>Eliza,</hi> knowing they could not return till the next Day, ſent to my Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to be inform'd concerning the Tragical Affair. Before he went to her, he ſent to give me Notice where he was going; tho' a dreadful Melancholy had ſeiz'd me, and the Pain of my Wound was troubleſome, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put on my Diſguiſe, and follow'd him to <hi>Eliza</hi>'s. I met him returning, but prevail'd on him to go back with me, and, if poſſible, to procure me a Meeting with my dear Miſtreſs. He comply'd with my
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0201000402:102"/>
Requeſt, and my Landlord having related every Circumſtance of my Affairs before, I receiv'd this Conſolation from my Miſtreſs, that ſhe cou'd but barely blame me for my Conduct, in the Danger I expos'd my ſelf to.</p>
                        <p>We parted with mutual Vows of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, but with ſad Preſages of what befel us afterwards.</p>
                        <p>It was about this time your noble Uncle fixt his Eyes upon me for your Tutor; tho' I muſt own I had no Inclinations that way; for I was yet fed with Hope, Fortune would ſtill befriend me in my Love.</p>
                        <p>A full Month paſt on, without hearing any thing from my dear <hi>Eliza.</hi> My Landlord was forbid ever entering the Doors of her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Father, and no Reaſon given for ſuch Treatment, tho' it was not hard to gueſs.

                        <p>This Letter made me ſhake Hands with Life again, which I had almoſt number'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my greateſt Enemies.

            <p>I muſt own, I was very much affected with the Story; and the more, becauſe it reſembled my own Fortune. The Reflexion gave me much Uneaſineſs. I ſent for him, and we mingled our Sighs and Tears together.</p>
            <p>Now, pray Sir, ſaid my Tutor, think, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Load of Grief which is fix'd upon me, whether Death is not the only Friend that can ſhake it off. I ſtrove to comfort him, with the little Eloquence I was Maſter of, but bid him have Recourſe to his Uncle's laſt Letter, and that wou'd teach him, Life was not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to diſpoſe of as we pleas'd, that was a Sin never to be repented of. And muſt I then bear this Load of Life (he reply'd) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps till grey Hairs appear upon my Head? No, no, Sorrow ſure will do its Office. Let <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> my dear Governor, ſaid I, ſupply the Place of <hi>Love,</hi> and that, from me, you may intirely depend on. He at laſt reſolv'd
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0201000402:108"/>
to ſuffer all, he told me, purely to oblige me.</p>
            <p>I now began to be in terrible Anxieties on my own Account, for in my laſt Letters from my Uncle, he mention'd nothing of my dear <hi>Iſabella.</hi> I remember'd, with Grief of Mind, I had left behind me a very powerful Rival, endow'd with Wealth and Title, the Pride of the Female Sex; but then, I thought <hi>Iſabella</hi> had none of her Sex's Frailties, and I wou'd ſooner believe the Legend of the wonderful Images of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> than think ſhe cou'd prove falſe <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <p>In the Church of <hi>Bouças</hi> (a Village near the City of <hi>Oporto,</hi> in the Capital of the Province <hi>Entre Douro e Minho,</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi>) is plac'd a Crucifix bigger than the Life, averr'd to be wrought by <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> It was caſt up by the Sea, and when it was firſt found, wanted an Arm. There were many curious Workmen employ'd to make the Image compleat; but as ſoon as the Arm was fix'd on, it immediately flew off again, to the Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Artiſts: In ſhort, there were as many Arms made, as would have ſerv'd another <hi>Briareus,</hi> or a <hi>Chineſe</hi> Idol, to no purpoſe. But at laſt (as the good Fathers are truly traditionally inform'd) one was found floating on the Sea, and being apply'd to the Image, ſtuck ſo faſt, without the Aſſiſtance of the Statuary, that it cou'd not be taken off again; and tho' the Body and Arm were found at ſome Years Diſtance, it prov'd to be the true Arm.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Santarem</hi> (a Town in the Province of <hi>Eſtremadura</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi>) is another wonderful Image of our bleſſed Saviour, an Infant, that has outgrown ſeveral Niches made purpoſely for it; and tho' firſt a Child, when erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they proteſt it now is full ſix Foot high, and has almoſt out-grown the laſt Nich; and if it ſhou'd proceed in thriving at this Rate, it is to be fear'd the Roof of the Church muſt be remov'd, to make room for it.</p>
               </note>. We imbark'd on Board of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0201000402:109"/>
one of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Gallies for <hi>Genoa,</hi> in order to view ſome Part of <hi>Italy</hi>; for I found it impracticable to go by Land, as my lovely <hi>Iſabella</hi> advis'd me in her Letter. But before I left <hi>Spain,</hi> I ſent my Uncle, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Miſtreſs, an Account of every thing that befell me, and where I was bound next.</p>
            <p>My poor Governor was ſtill inconſolable, tho' he ſtrove to appear chearful, in Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to me; but I found his Malady had ſtruck him to the Soul, and I fear'd Death would lay his Icy Hands upon him; yet I had hope, Variety of Objects might help him ſometimes to forget his Grief. And indeed, his Fortune having ſomething reſembling my own, made me doubly ſuffer with him. I had forgot to ask him who the Perſon was, we ſaw at <hi>Paris,</hi> that gave him ſo much Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and when it came into my Memory,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0201000402:110"/>
forbore to ask him, for fear I ſhould recall his Sufferings up afreſh; but when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Genoa,</hi> we found that young Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man there, where he avoided him as before. He then inform'd me, it was a diſtant Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Perſuaſion, that had often done him ill Offices upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his being a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>; and farther, to make him hate him, had begun to make his Addreſſes to his dear <hi>Eliza,</hi> purely in Contradiction to him. Upon that Account, I reſolv'd to make but a ſhort Stay there.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> no doubt, is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Some will have <hi>Janus</hi> the Founder; tho' I can't but think the Word <hi>Janua</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a <hi>Gate</hi>; and it was certainly, in the Time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> one of the Gates to <hi>Italy.</hi> It was undoubtedly a City of great Power, when <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſh'd; for <hi>Livy</hi> tells me, <hi>Liguria (Genoa</hi> being its Capital) revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt 'em, when <hi>Rome</hi> triumphed over <hi>Africa, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi>; their Armies preſt the <hi>Romans</hi> to that Degree, that they offer'd Vows to <hi>Jupiter Stator,</hi> to ſtop the Progreſs of the <hi>Ligurians</hi>; but at laſt, more by Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than Force, it was made a Province of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0201000402:111"/>Of all the Countries in the Univerſe, <hi>Genoa</hi> ſeems the moſt abandon'd by Nature; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt aſſiſted by Human Induſtry; for, notwithſtanding the Barrenneſs of the Situation, among high Cliffs, and fruitleſs Mountains, one of the proudeſt Cities of <hi>Europe</hi> raiſes her aſpiring Head. There's not one Foot of Earth in their noble Gardens, but ſtands 'em in as much as an Acre in <hi>Wales.</hi> This proud City ſuffer'd much in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. by a hoſtile Fleet ſent to puniſh the <hi>State</hi> for ſome Miſdemeanors, which forc'd them to a diſadvantageous Peace.

            <p>At this City I receiv'd a Packet from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> brought me by a young Gentleman of the ſweeteſt Countenance I ever ſaw; tho' the Letters he gave me, almoſt diſtracted me. That from my Uncle, was as follows:

following Account. That pernicious Woman, the Complication of all ill Women in one, has deceiv'd both thee and me. Laſt Week, my dear Brother (thy Father) ſent a Meſſenger to me, deſiring me to come to him without Delay. I found him almoſt expiring. When I enter'd the Room where he lay, the firſt Object I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, was the vile Woman's Son <hi>John,</hi> ſtretch'd dead upon the Ground. The Sight very much ſurpriſing me, thy Father, faintly, call'd me to come near: That, ſaid he, is the firſt Part of the Puniſhment due to my cruel Murdereſs. This Morning (continu'd your Father) that Wretch, my Wife, ſent me my Tea, as uſual, when ſhe wou'd not favour me with her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and the unfortunate Boy, bringing an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe from his Mother, that ſhe cou'd not Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with me, I detain'd him to keep me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. It was not long before the Mother fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, and inquired, in the utmoſt Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whether he had drank any of the Tea? The Boy reſolv'd her, he had drank two Diſhes. I found, by her extravagant Exclamations, there was ſomething extraordinary in the Affair, and ſoon found we were both poiſon'd. In my Rage, I drew my Sword, and made her partake of the ſame bitter Cup, more than once, then lock'd her in that Cloſet, where I have heard no Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0201000402:113"/>
theſe three Hours; perhaps the Period of her wicked Life is come, for I find my own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. Dear Brother, I have very little to ſay, the rugged Hand of Death has ſeiz'd me. Pray keep this Story ſecret, if 'tis poſſible; and be a Father to my dear Boy. He wou'd have ſaid more, but the Pangs of Death ſtop'd his Tongue, and his Eyes clos'd for ever. The mournful Sight drove me into ſuch a furious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that I drew my Sword in order to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the Author of our Misfortune; but when I open'd the Cloſet-Door, there was not any Body to be found. Searching about, I perceiv'd ſome Linnen ty'd to the Foot of your Father's <hi>Eſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi> which hung out of the Window; going to ſee how ſhe had made her Eſcape, I perceived her Body lie breathleſs under the Window, upon the Ground, with her Brains on a large Stone, the only one, I believe, in the whole Garden. The Linnen, I find, broke about a Foot below the Saſh ſhe went out at. She has ſuffer'd by the Hand of Heaven, 'tis true; but we have loſt a Brother and a Father by her Wickedneſs, who impos'd upon our eaſy Natures. Come, my dear Son (for I now muſt call you ſo) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me for this irreparable Loſs; nothing but your Sight can aſſuage my Grief.

            <p>This Letter put me out of Love with Life; and my good Governor gave me that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he had formerly receiv'd from me; but had it not been for the Conſideration of my Uncle, and my divine <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I believe I ſhould have call'd Death to my Aid. The Letter I receiv'd from her, gave me ſome Conſolation; it was wrote in ſuch a touching
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0201000402:115"/>
manner for my Loſs, with the Lamentation of her whole Family, and her Dependance on my Life and Love, that I reſolv'd to live, if it was but to thank her for her Tenderneſs; tho' I muſt own I felt the utmoſt Concern in the Loſs of that conſolative Epiſtle. It was three whole Days, before I inquired for the young Gentleman that brought me the Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. But what was my Surprize, when my Governor brought him to ſee me, and at the ſame time told me, in that young Gentleman I beheld his amiable <hi>Eliza!</hi> I forgot all my Sorrows at ſo unexpected a Rencounter, and my Heart overflow'd with an inexpreſſible Joy on the behalf of my Governor. I cou'd hardly believe my Senſes. What, cry'd I, dead, and reviv'd again! I muſt own, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the charming <hi>Eliza,</hi> my Story is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Romantic: But the Obligations my Lover has receiv'd from you, ſhall prevail upon me to relate that Part of it, which you are a Stranger to; and tho' I ought to bluſh at this Transformation, I am ſure you will forgive me, when you know it proceeds from Love.</p>
            <p>After our Ill-fortune had ſeparated us, a Gentleman of a great Eſtate, related to <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimont,</hi> renew'd his fulſome Addreſſes to me, and tho' of a different Religion, my Father
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0201000402:116"/>
gave his cruel Conſent, and the Day was fixt for our Nuptials: By the Advice of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Acquaintance, I drank a Sleeping. Draught, which depriv'd me, ſeemingly, of all the Faculties of Life. When the intended Bridegroom came, he was very eaſy under his Diſappointment, and ſaid to one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (loud enough to be heard by my Father) Pox on't! this had been lucky enough, <hi>Dick,</hi> if ſhe had ſtaid till the Day after our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Very true, reply'd the Servant, the Wedding-Sheets and the Shroud, are the beſt Linnen can be put on a Woman. And the ſooner ſhe changes, return'd the Maſter, the better. Then, with a Horſe-Laugh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any Leave, they rid away.</p>
            <p>My Father was very much incens'd at his brutal Behaviour, and, as I found afterwards, repented his Uſage of me. He prepared a magnificent Funeral, but I ſpar'd him the Trouble, in coming to Life again; and, I muſt own, never receiv'd any Teſtimony of his Tenderneſs before: He careſs'd me with all the Love expected from a Parent, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never more to force my Inclination; and ſpoke ſeveral favourable things of my dear <hi>Clerimont.</hi> But, alas! the Funeral he had taken ſuch Pains to furniſh out for me, prov'd
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0201000402:117"/>
in ſome fort for himſelf; for, two Days after my Revival, leaning over a Balcony, to give ſome Directions to the Workmen in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it gave way, and he fell, never to riſe again in this World.</p>
            <p>The fatal Accident (notwithſtanding I was a free Woman, and Miſtreſs of a plentiful Fortune) gave me unſpeakable Diſcontent; for by his Behaviour to me, I began to revive the Love and Duty which his former Severity had almoſt kill'd. After I had perform'd the Funeral Rites, I began to think of my dear <hi>Clerimont</hi>; and being inform'd by his good Uncle, he had wrote him an Account of my ſuppoſed Death, took a Reſolution of unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him myſelf; therefore embark'd for <hi>Barcelona</hi> in a Ship of my own (ſince my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Death) as a Paſſenger, unknown to any one, after ſettling my Affairs at home. I ſoon found you out, and had the Pleaſure of ſeeing the deep Melancholy growing in the Face of my Lover. I embark'd with you for <hi>Genoa,</hi> without diſcovering myſelf, or ever appearing before him, but in the Night, to obſerve his Sighs. Going to the Poſt-Houſe here, I found that fatal Packet direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for you, and took that Opportunity to wait on you; tho' had I underſtood the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0201000402:118"/>
of it, I ſhould not ſo readily have brought it. Laſt Night I reveal'd myſelf to <hi>Clerimont,</hi> for I cou'd no longer bear his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; and to-day he has brought me to pay you the Thanks ſuitable to your Goodneſs; but, as I have not Words ſufficient, I beg you would take even my Silence for the Force of Eloquence working in my Mind. That ſhou'd be my Task, reply'd my Governor; but I am as uncapable as you; for I find the Torrent of Joy pour'd ſo unexpectedly in upon me, has made ſuch a Revolution in my Soul, that my Body is not able to bear the Tranſport: Therefore, dear Sir, think your ſelf, what a grateful Heart wou'd ſay, and imagine my Thanks.</p>
            <p>The good Fortune of theſe happy Lovers, was the Balm to the extreme Sorrow I felt. I was reſolv'd to return for <hi>England</hi> with my Governor and his Miſtreſs, in the firſt Veſſel of our Country that was ready; but at laſt, it was agreed to travel by Land, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conveniency of <hi>Eliza.</hi>

            <p>While we were providing for our Journey, a Galley of <hi>Genoa</hi> arriv'd, with a Corſair of <hi>Barbary</hi> ſhe had taken, after a bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. There were ſix and Thirty Slaves redeem'd from a wretched Captivity they had
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0201000402:119"/>
undergone on Board the Corſair. Hearing there was one <hi>Engliſhman</hi> among 'em, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to relieve him, and carry him home along with me, after his hard Sufferings. My Governor went, according to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and brought him to me. At firſt Sight, I was ſtruck with a Tenderneſs I cou'd not give any Account for; but after a little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I found it was my Brother <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> who had been abſent above Eight Years. I never conſider'd, I had met with one that wou'd take ſome part of my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune from me; but the Joy I receiv'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving an only Brother from Miſery, gave me the utmoſt Satisfaction. He gave me his Hiſtory in the following manner.</p>

                        <p>YOU were ſo young, my dear Brother, when I left my Father's Houſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make a Campaign in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that I believe you can hardly remember it. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Richard,</hi> and I, were both Cadets at the Siege of <hi>Namur</hi>; and tho' we behav'd our ſelves, perhaps, with Courage enough, we gain'd nothing more than ſeveral dangerous Wounds, that confin'd us to our Quarters longer than we deſir'd; for our glorious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, King <hi>William,</hi> took that Place, held before as impregnable, while we had the Mortification of being under the Surgeon's Hands.</p>
                        <p>When we had Strength enough to go to the Field, the Campaign was ended; and our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0201000402:121"/>
Money falling ſhort, we cou'd not provide Neceſſaries to embark for <hi>England</hi> with the King, without making Figures below our Birth; we wrote to our Father, laying before him our Neceſſities, and had 50 <hi>l.</hi> paid us by a Banker of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> With this ſmall Pittance, we had the diſagreeable News of by Father's Second Marriage; and a ſcurvy Hint, that Money wou'd not be ſo ready for the future. This put us almoſt out of our Senſes, for 50 <hi>l.</hi> would not go far, with a couple of young Fellows juſt coming into the World, that were oblig'd to live like Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. However, to make the beſt on't, we diſcharg'd our Servants, ſold our Horſes, with ſome part of our unneceſſary Equipage, and rais'd our Bank to a Hundred Piſtoles; With this ſmall Stock we embark'd for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where we were inform'd our King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be at the Head of his Troops, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the following Spring; for it was ſtrongly reported, the Rebels had gather'd together a formidable Army there. But meeting an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Veſſel in the Channel, this News was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted. They gave us an Account of the Aſſaſſination-Plot, and that every thing was quiet in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This put an end to all our Hopes of getting Employment; therefore we
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0201000402:122"/>
intended to Land in <hi>England,</hi> and ſteer our Courſe homeward; but Providence intended otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Day after we put to Sea, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the <hi>Lizard,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Privateer at the ſame time.

By good Fortune, I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd the beſt part of our Money in the Waiſtband of my Breeches; and the Captain ſeeing my Grief for the Loſs of my dear Brother, prevented my being ſearch'd, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me all our little Equipage, and us'd me with a tender Friendſhip. When we landed,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0201000402:123"/>
I was not impriſon'd with the reſt of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Men, but was almoſt compell'd to live with the Captain. I freely own'd to him the Money I conceal'd, but he would not touch a Penny.</p>
                        <p>I wrote ſeveral Letters to my Father, wherein I acquainted him with my hard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Death of my poor Brother; begging him to relieve me from my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, by paying my Ranſom, which I had agreed with my Captain for Three Hundred Crowns: I cou'd have ſatisfy'd him with what little Money I had, but he refus'd it, telling me, he wou'd ſtay till it was ſent me by my Friends, that he might have more of my Company. I receiv'd but one Letter to the many I ſent, and that gave me Hopes I ſhou'd have the Money I wrote for, by the firſt Opportunity; but I waited in painful Expectation near a Twelvemonth, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and my little Stock was almoſt ſpent; beſides, my Cloaths were pretty well wore out, and I began to fear I ſhou'd want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Neceſſaries.</p>
                        <p>My Captain continu'd very kind to me, notwithſtanding the Reaſon he had to the contrary; nay, offer'd me my Freedom on my bare Word, but my Heart wou'd not let

me accept it. At laſt, he preſs'd me to go to Sea with him; but I told him, Whatever Obligations I had to him, I hop'd he wou'd excuſe me, if I refus'd to fight againſt my own King and Country. I might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the Service of a Nobleman, but my Spirit wou'd not permit me.

                              <hi>Tunis,</hi> is a City and Sea-Port upon the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> govern'd by a <hi>Bey,</hi> or <hi>Dey,</hi> tho' ſubſervient to the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> It is large, ſtrong, and very well Peopled.

                        <p>When we arriv'd at <hi>Tunis,</hi> we bombarded it for ſix Days, and almoſt reduc'd it to Aſhes. There were ſeveral Merchant-Ships
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0201000402:125"/>
within the Bar, that the Corſairs had taken from ſeveral Nations; one, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd was richly laden. With our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Conſent, I took fifteen Men, well arm'd; and in the middle of the Night we row'd into the Harbour, under the Mouths of their Cannon, cut her Cable, and brought her off. But the Ship's Sails being taken off the Yards, we were oblig'd to tow her away with our Long-Boat; the whole Bulwarks thunder'd upon us inceſſantly, and at laſt an unlucky Shot tore to pieces our Long-Boat. What became of the reſt of the Men, I know not, for never having learnt to ſwim, I ſoon loſt my Senſes.</p>
                        <p>By the Beams of the Morning-Sun, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open my Eyes, and perceiv'd I was caſt upon a Ridge of Sand, that the Tide of Ebb had left uncover'd, under a Rock at the Back of the Town, yet out of Sight, either of the Ships or Harbour, tho' I cou'd hear the <hi>Moors</hi> Voices above me. I was very faint, and found it difficult to riſe; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd ſome Strength, when I had diſgorg'd the vaſt Quantity of Sea-Water I had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. By good Fortune, I had a ſmall Brandy-Bottle in my Pocket, that was of great Service in reviving my Spirits.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0201000402:126"/>I began to walk, but, to my great Grief, found I had above two Miles to go, upon the Sand, before I cou'd come to an Opening of the Country; and, to add to my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Tide was flowing very faſt, ſo that if I did not make haſte, it wou'd overtake me before I cou'd get away. Judge then, my Diſtreſs; if I ſtaid where I was, I muſt have inevitably been drown'd; and if I went on, I had no Hopes but of being a miſerable Slave.</p>
                        <p>I walk'd as faſt as I cou'd, tho' Heaven knows, with a heavy Heart: Yet, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I thought as I was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> it might be of ſome Advantage to me; and therefore form'd a Story in my Mind, that I hop'd wou'd prevent my falling into Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                        <p>When I had got off the Sand, I perceiv'd the Country about me was chiefly Gardens; but being fatigu'd thro' Heat, and Weakneſs, I was oblig'd to ſit down under a high Wall of Reeds, deſign'd for a Fence to a Garden behind me. Under this Shade, my Sorrows and Reflexions brought Sleep upon me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I wou'd or no, for I ſtrove to reſiſt it; but was ſoon (I believe) awak'd by Dirt and Weeds that were thrown upon me out of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0201000402:127"/>
Garden behind. The Surprize made me cry out, upon the Inſtant I heard People call out to me, as I ſuppos'd, in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, tho' I cou'd not underſtand 'em. I got up, and walk'd on, and immediately was met by four <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Gardeners, as I imagin'd by their Implements. I went ſubmiſſively up to 'em, tho' I perceiv'd they were in ſome Conſternation, by their Faces. We talk'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, tho' we could not underſtand one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. At laſt, one of 'em went from the reſt, and return'd in a few Minutes with two more; one of 'em ſeem'd to be their Maſter, by his Habit; and the other was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Slave. I underſtood enough of that Language, by the help of my <hi>Latin,</hi> to let him into the Knowledge of my being an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi> When their Maſter found that, an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirteen or fourteen Years of Age, was ſent for. This Boy, as I was inform'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was taken in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel when he was about nine Years of Age, going to <hi>Maryland</hi> with his Parents, who both dy'd with Grief at their Misfortune, and the Lad was prevail'd upon to turn <hi>Mahometan.</hi> I told him I was an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> taken Priſoner by the <hi>French,</hi> and made my Eſcape from 'em in the Night, in one of their Boats, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0201000402:128"/>
but being unacquainted with the Coaſt, was thrown upon the Sand-Bank. The <hi>Moor</hi> order'd me to be ask'd, if I underſtood the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> or <hi>Navigation</hi>; or whether I had any Friends at <hi>Tunis?</hi> I reply'd, as to the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> I had no Knowledge of them, as being deſign'd for the Land-Service. But I hop'd every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> wou'd be a Friend to their wretched Countryman, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. I added, I did intend to apply to the Conſul at <hi>Tunis.</hi> But the <hi>Moor</hi> inform'd me, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul, and moſt of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, had abandon'd the City, on account of its being bombarded by the <hi>French.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſhort, I found by all his Diſcourſe, he intended me for one of his Slaves. It wou'd avail me nothing to reaſon with him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was forc'd, through a fatal Neceſſity, to accept of my Chains as chearfully as I could. I was taken into the Houſe through the Garden, with ſome ſeeming Civility, and had a comfortable Supper, if my Sorrows had not ſpoil'd my Stomach; tho' I eat and ſlept alone, upon a Bed made of Rice Straw. But alas! Reflexion brought ten thouſand Daggers to my Heart, and Reſt was almoſt a Stranger for many Days.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0201000402:129"/>My Maſter never troubled himſelf about the Siege. Yet I had the Curioſity to inquire of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lad, how things went, and had ſome Pleaſure to hear, that the Ship we got out of the Mole, was ſafe in the <hi>French</hi> Fleet.</p>
                        <p>My chief Buſineſs, at firſt, was to look after three <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſes, that belong'd to my Maſter; and I happen'd to do my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo well, that he gave me ſome Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; and his Son (about Seventeen) would be never out of my Company.</p>
                        <p>In three Months Time, I made a very good Progreſs in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Tongue, I could make ſhift to talk with my Maſter in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I begg'd the Favour of him to let me ſee the City of <hi>Tunis,</hi> but he would not let me ſtir out of his Houſe. The <hi>French</hi> Fleet did not ſtay long after my unfortunate Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but I learnt by the Boy, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the City almoſt to Ruins. The Reaſon of my Maſter's not permitting me to go into <hi>Tunis,</hi> was (as I ſuppos'd) for fear I ſhould meet with ſome Merchants that might procure me my Freedom.</p>
                        <p>Underſtanding I could play a little on the Flute, he procur'd me ſeveral very good ones, with which I had the Misfortune to pleaſe him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0201000402:130"/>
more than I deſired. But alas! What is Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to a Wretch that every Moment long'd for Liberty? or with what Fancy could I touch the Inſtrument, when my Thoughts were ever fixt upon my hard Fate? However, I was the more eſteem'd by him; and I muſt confeſs, if all their Slaves were us'd as I was, they could have nothing to trouble them, but their want of Liberty. But Liberty's the Salt of Life, and nothing can reliſh without it, or ſupply its Place.</p>
                        <p>My Maſter liv'd a luxurious, idle Life, as all the <hi>Moors</hi> do, that have not Employments. All his Time was ſpent in Eating, Drinking, Praying, Sleeping, performing the Ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="*" place="bottom">The Ablution, is a Waſhing which the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> perform, after they think themſelves polluted by the Converſation of Women, Sleeping, doing the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Nature, touching a Chriſtian, or a Drop of Wine ſpilt on their Garments; nay, ſome are ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, never more to wear thoſe Garments.</note>, or viſiting his Wives: They were five in Number; but I can't deſcribe their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never having an Opportunity to ſee their Faces; but their Shape and Air ſeem'd very inviting. I often ſaw ſome of 'em at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the Garden, with their Faces veil'd, for none of the Slaves are allow'd to ſpeak to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0201000402:131"/>
them; or even to come near enough to do it, would be an unpardonable Crime.</p>
                        <p>I began now to think, all Hopes of ſeeing my own Country were over with me; for I cou'd not find the Means of ſending a Letter to my Father in <hi>England.</hi> All the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had in my Miſery, was, that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter never importun'd me on the Account of my Religion. I ſpent four Years in my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Servitude, for I always thought it ſo, notwithſtanding my favourable Uſage. In the beginning of the fifth Year of my wretched Slavery, my Maſter dy'd, and his Son took Poſſeſſion of his Father's Fortune. I began now to feel the Hopes of Freedom revive in my Soul again, for the young <hi>Moor</hi> ſeem'd to have ſome Friendſhip for me. But alas! I found, to my terrible Conſternation, he was poſſeſs'd with the moſt hateful Paſſion Man can be guilty of. He ſoon alter'd his Uſage of me, when I let him know, I would rather ſuffer Death, than comply with his infamous Deſires. I can hardly mention it without Bluſhing. His ill Treatment, upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, plung'd me into Deſpair; for, to be reveng'd on me, he not only put me upon the moſt ſervile Offices, but I often ſuffer'd the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0201000402:132"/>
Baſtinado <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Baſtinado,</hi> is a Number of Blows, with a thick Cudgel, on the Soles of the Feet, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes the Sufferer incapable of walking many Days. The <hi>Moors</hi> not only puniſh Slaves that way, but <hi>Mahometans</hi> alſo, when they are guilty of Theft, and not able to return what they ſtole.</note>. I believe, if I could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd any Weapons, I ſhould have cut him in pieces, and put an end to my own Anguiſh by a voluntary Death.</p>
                        <p>The young <hi>Engliſh Mahometan</hi> often gave me ſome Conſolation, by mingling Tears with me; but alas! that Tenderneſs was all he could give me, and that very ſecretly. My Miſeries increas'd upon me, and I begg'd the Youth to procure me a Doſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> that I might ſink into an eternal Sleep, and loſe my Life and Miſery together; but I could not prevail upon him.</p>
                        <p>My new Beaſt of a Maſter, about a Month after the Death of his Father, was oblig'd to take a Journey to look after the Eſtate that was left him. I knew not how far he was to go, but I was inform'd, his Affairs would keep him in the Country Forty Days at leaſt; ſo I reſolv'd, in that Time, to make ſome Attempts to eſcape, tho' I loſt my Life.</p>

                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0201000402:133"/>When he was gone, I had little Buſineſs to do, and was well us'd; for even the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Servants were concern'd for my barbarous Treatment. When they had an Opportunity, they would come to hear me play on the Flute, and always bring ſomething to make merry with.</p>
                        <p>One Evening an old Woman came to me, before the reſt of the Servants, and gave me a Letter, which I open'd, and, to my Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, found the following Words in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:</hi>

                        <p>Imagine, dear Brother, the Pleaſure that fill'd my Mind at the Reading of this Letter; but I muſt own they proceeded from the Hopes of my Liberty, for Love had never yet laid hold of my Heart.</p>
                        <p>In the Evening, when the Servants came about me as uſual, they were amaz'd to find me ſo merry. I ſung ſeveral <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Love-Songs, that I had learnt among 'em, for their Language is very Poetical; and ſeveral <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
                           <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0201000402:136"/>
ones, that touch'd upon my own Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which very much delighted 'em. In ſhort, we ſpent the Evening in Pleaſure and Mirth.</p>
                        <p>I went to reſt with a Mind far more at Eaſe than uſual; but had not ſlept long, before I was awak'd with a gentle Rapping at my Cell Door. When I open'd it, I perceiv'd the old Matron that brought me the Letter. Come, ſaid ſhe (in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Language, very ſoftly) put on your Cloaths, and follow me from <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Hell, into Paradiſe; I'll be your Conductor, tho' a Chriſtian, as well as yourſelf. I dreſs'd myſelf, with a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Thought I had never felt before. I follow'd my Conductreſs, without well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I was about; and entred into a lower Room of a Summer-Houſe, at the bottom of the Garden, in the Dark, where I heard the ſweeteſt Voice I ever heard in my Life (the Sound went quite thro' my Soul, and ſet my Body in a Tremble) bid the She-Slave make faſt the Door, ſaid the Lady, and light up Tapers. She inſtantly obey'd, and ſhew'd me the moſt amiable young Creature, my Eyes ever beheld. I ſtood like one chang'd into a Statue with Admiration, and I was not able to utter a Word for ſome time. I kneel'd down
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0201000402:137"/>
before her, and kiſs'd her Sleeve <note n="*" place="bottom">The Sleeves of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> hang down ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low, and by Kneeling, and Kiſſing them, is expreſs'd the moſt profound Submiſſion, either to Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note>. But ſhe gently rais'd me up, with the moſt obliging Smile imaginable. What, Sir, ſaid ſhe, muſt I, againſt the Cuſtom of your Country, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my Paſſion for you, and not have a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Word in return? I reply'd, the Sight of ſuch an unexpected Angel, might well take all my Faculties away. Come, ſaid ſhe, ſit down, and partake of a ſmall Repaſt I have prepar'd for you, and chear your Spirits with a Cup of Wine; tho' I drink none myſelf (not out of any Reſpect to the Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> but that I never was accuſtom'd to it) I know you <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen make it your common Drink. I begg'd to be excus'd from either, neither could I indeed, for the Sight of her, fill'd my Soul with a Profuſion of Delight. [And, dear Brother, you muſt love, like me, before you can gueſs at the ſoft thrilling Pleaſure that ran thro' my Blood.] I won't detain you with the tender things we ſaid to each other. But ſure, Novels and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances can't produce you a Heroe that ever was ſo much ſtruck at the firſt Sight of his
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0201000402:138"/>
adorable Miſtreſs; 'twas then I wore the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chains, of Love and Bondage. In ſhort, we exchang'd our Hearts, and gave one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſurances of eternal Fidelity, that can never be ſhaken on my Part, or I believe on hers.</p>
                        <p>I muſt beg Leave to recover myſelf from this Tenderneſs, not altogether becoming a Man, before I can purſue the Thread of my uncomfortable Story.</p>
                        <p>Several Evenings were paſt thus delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, during the Abſence of her Brother. We had many Schemes to ſet us at Liberty; and at laſt agreed, I ſhould have a Sufficiency from her to pay my Ranſom, tho' it ſhou'd amount to ten thouſand Crowns; and when I had got my Liberty, ſhe wou'd find Means to make her Eſcape to me. I muſt own, tho' it was a Proof of the Sincerity of her Love, I made many Scruples of receiving Money from her; but ſhe aſſur'd me, ſhe wou'd make uſe of none but her own. She had prevail'd on her Father to ſettle a ſufficient Fortune upon her, tho' very uncuſtomary, that ſhe might ever live a ſingle Life; tho' her only Reaſon was, ſhe never wou'd join in Marriage with one contrary to her own Religion; and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being infinitely fond of her (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0201000402:139"/>
her true Motive) gave into her Poſſeſſion ſecretly, the Value of Twenty Thouſand Pounds, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, beſides ſeveral rich Jewels. The Thoughts of ſo much unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Happineſs, gave another Turn to my Looks, which I could not hide; but I made the Servants and Slaves believe, the Abſence of my Maſter occaſion'd the Alteration.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Jew</hi> was pitch'd upon to tranſact the Affair, who are a ſort of People in that Country, us'd to all manner of Buſineſs, and of the utmoſt Secrecy, when Money ties up their Tongues. This <hi>Jew</hi> was to bargain with my Maſter for my Freedom, as cheap as he cou'd, and to have two hundred and fifty Crowns, when the Affair was compleated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He knew nothing of <hi>Fatima</hi> (that is the Name of my divine Miſtreſs) for the Bargain was made by the old Woman.</p>
                        <p>One Day, when I was pleaſing myſelf with the Thoughts of my coming Happineſs, my Maſter arriv'd, even twenty Days before he was expected. The Moment he came in, I was order'd before him. Here, ſaid he, in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue (to a <hi>Moor</hi> that was with him) is the ſurly Slave I told you of, he's yours now, uſe him like a Dog, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves! and take him from my Sight this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0201000402:140"/>
Upon the Inſtant, I was loaden with Chains, and by ſeveral Slaves, forc'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my new Maſter. I was in ſuch a Surpriſe, that I had not open'd my Mouth, till we had got a good diſtance from the Houſe. I then deſir'd ſubmiſſively, to ſpeak to him. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him there was Money come from my Friends, and now in the Hands of <hi>Ben Addi</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> to pay for my Ranſom. He told me, he would talk with me about it when he came back from his Voyage. I was thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck at his Anſwer, and endeavour'd to ſoften him, but in vain, for we never ſtopt till we came on Board a Galley that lay in the Road of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and in two Hours afterwards put to Sea.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as I came on Board, I was chain'd to an Oar, and if I did not do as I ſhou'd do, I was taught with many unmerciful Blows. I endeavour'd to put an end to my miſerable Life, with my Irons, but was prevented with another Chaſtiſement. The Thoughts of my dear <hi>Fatima,</hi> made me more outragious, and I was reſolv'd to ſtarve myſelf to Death. I exclaim'd againſt Fortune, my old Maſter, and my new one, in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Language, in hope it might provoke the latter to put an end to my Life. But inſtead of that, he came
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0201000402:141"/>
to me, deſiring I wou'd have Patience; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I'll treat with you for your Ranſom now; and I ſwear by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when I come back, and you pay me what I agree with you for, you ſhall that Moment have your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Promiſe compos'd me a little, for the <hi>Moors</hi> never falſify their Words, when they ſwear by their Prophet. I begg'd his Pardon for the Rudeneſs of my Tongue, and promis'd to do my Duty quietly for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We agreed for Five Hundred Crowns, and I proffer'd him Fifty more if he wou'd releaſe me from my hard Labour. He told me he cou'd not do that, becauſe he ſhould want one to ſupply my Place: He farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if I cou'd ſtrike up a Bargain with any of the Sailors, and do what I could in the Room of the Perſon that wou'd undertake it, he wou'd freely give his Conſent; but not one of the <hi>Moors</hi> would liſten to the Propoſal; at laſt, the Gunner's Mate agreed with me for Twenty Crowns, provided I wou'd reaſſume my Oar when we came to any Engagement. The Bargain being ſtruck, my Chains were taken off, and I agreed with the Captain, my Maſter (who was a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Renagado) to eat at his Table for the other Thirty Crowns. This wou'd not have been comply'd with, had
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0201000402:142"/>
he been a natural <hi>Moor,</hi> for they never eat with the Chriſtians; but Renegadoes are not ſo ſcrupulous.</p>
                        <p>We were out two Months, before we met with any Ship of <hi>Europe</hi>; but near the Coaſt of <hi>Alicant,</hi> we encounter'd an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant-Ship, that prov'd too hard for us, diſabling our Galley, and killing and wounding above Fifty of our Men; ſo that at laſt, our Captain thought fit to give over the Attempt. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go back to <hi>Tunis,</hi> to refit. But the next Day, a violent Storm took us, which, laſting eight Days, we were drove out of our Courſe; and when it abated, we found our ſelves near the Iſland of <hi>Corſica.</hi> Several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes advis'd the Captain to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, and ſeize ſome of the Inhabitants, in order to better their Voyage, which he comply'd with; tho' much to my Sorrow, to be ſo long abſent from <hi>Tunis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Turning a Point of Land, we diſcover'd a Galley of <hi>Genoa,</hi> preparing, in a great Hurry, to attack us; we endeavour'd to get away, but to no Purpoſe, for they came up with us, and after a deſperate Engagement, took us, tho' with great Loſs on both Sides; neither do I believe we had ſubmitted, if our Captain had not been kill'd; for, I think, I never ſaw a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0201000402:143"/>
Man behave himſelf with more Courage and Conduct, when he found there was no avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engagement.</p>

            <p>Thus, my dear Brother, I have gain'd my Freedom from the Chains of Bondage. And ſure, never any Priſoner rejoic'd leſs at his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than I do; and if I had not met with you, that gives me all the Joy I am capable of feeling, without my dear <hi>Fatima,</hi> I believe my Sorrows wou'd have made an end of my miſerable Life. Nay, as it is, I can never be happy without her. We condol'd with my Brother ſome time, at his melancholy Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I muſt confeſs, I felt ſo much, that my Heart prompted me to think of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring off the Object of his Deſires. When I communicated my Thoughts to my Brother, he was tranſported. We were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days, before we cou'd light upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ſeem'd reaſonable. At laſt, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to hire a <hi>Tartane,</hi> and engage about a Dozen reſolute Men, who ſhou'd be all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd in <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Habits. We got a broad flat-bottom'd Boat built on purpoſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like our Ferry-Boats in <hi>England,</hi> only with higher Sides, and not ſo heavy. With theſe, we intended to ſail for <hi>Tunis,</hi> anchor
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0201000402:144"/>
as near as we cou'd to the long Sand-Bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Rocks, my Brother mention'd, where he was thrown out of the Long-Boat; then with our flat-bottom Boat, land as near the Houſe of <hi>Fatima</hi>'s Brother, as we cou'd, and bring her away by Force.</p>
            <p>My Brother and Governor lik'd the Deſign very well, and wou'd make one in it, even with the Conſent of the fair <hi>Eliza,</hi> who was reſolv'd her dear <hi>Clerimont</hi> ſhou'd partake of whatever Fortune befell us; nay, it was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Power to prevent her going along with us. We hir'd a Veſſel, and got our Boat ready, but we had much Difficulty to get Men; ſome of the Slaves were ſolicited (I mean, thoſe that were ſet at Liberty with my Brother) but none wou'd venture near the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> Coaſt again, willingly. At laſt, by great Rewards, I pickt out Seven <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and Four <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> that promis'd to ſacrifice their Lives for us.</p>
            <p>We embark'd with a favourable Wind, and arriv'd in the Latitude of <hi>Tunis</hi> in twelve Days; but we did not think it proper to come too near till it was dark. When Night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, we made for the Shore, and anchor'd within half a Mile of the Sand; then getting our flat-bottom'd Boat out, my Brother, my
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0201000402:145"/>
Governor, myſelf, and Nine of our Men, got into it, every one arm'd with two Brace of Piſtols, a Cutlaſs, and a ſhort Dagger; but we were not got above half a Mile from the Ship, ere we ſtruck on the Sands; tho' we ſuffer'd no Damage, becauſe the Sea was very calm. But the Tide flowing, our Boat float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again in half an Hour. When we came near the Shore, we left off Rowing, and ſet her forward with Poles got for that Purpoſe, that we might not be diſcover'd by the Noiſe of our Oars. We ſoon landed at the Place my Brother purpos'd; two of our Men we left to ſecure the Boat, and keep her even with the Water, as the Tide ebb'd away. We then ſet forward, led by my Brother. When we came near the Place, a great Maſtiff Dog open'd ſo loud, that he might be heard even to the City of <hi>Tunis.</hi> But my Brother being foremoſt, and knowing him, call'd him by his Name; but the poor Creature's Joy to ſee him, was almoſt as loud as his Barking.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Houſe was alarm'd, for we cou'd ſee Torches waving too and fro in the Garden. However, we encourag'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and went boldly on to the Gate. Juſt as we came to it, it flew open, and a young <hi>Moor</hi> flew from us like Lightning. We did
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0201000402:146"/>
not care to loſe time in purſuing him, but preſs'd in, ſtill following my Brother, who led us into the very Court-yard. The firſt he met ſeem'd to be a Perſon of Diſtinction, by the Richneſs of his Dreſs. He was follow'd by ſeven or eight Servants. When he came up to my Brother, he made a Stop, and ſome Words paſſing between 'em, in the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Tongue, the <hi>Moor</hi> immediately fir'd a Piſtol at him. We thought we had no Time to loſe, but fell upon 'em like ſo many Furies, kill'd two or three of 'em, and immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd the reſt. But as we were following my Brother into the Houſe, we perceiv'd him faint, and fall Speechleſs upon the Ground. While we were examining his Wound, a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly young Creature came running to us, all in Diſorder, crying in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> If you are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, protect me. I did not doubt but this was the fair <hi>Fatima,</hi> by her extraordinary Beauty, and ſpeaking <hi>Engliſh</hi>; therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd my Brother, who was ſhot quite thro' the Thigh, to be put in a Wheel-barrow, and immediately carry'd to the Boat. We had put our Handkerchiefs into the Wound, and ſtopt the Bleeding, but he had not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his Senſes. We immediately follow'd, with the amiable Chriſtian <hi>Moor,</hi> but were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0201000402:147"/>
forc'd to turn about to defend ourſelves againſt the Perſon that fir'd at my Brother, and his Slaves that he had once more rally'd. He call'd to us in a prodigious Fury, but we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him not. He made a Stroke at my Head with his Scimitar, that wou'd have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ended my Days, if I had not receiv'd it on the Hilt of my Sabre; but I ended his Fury, by ſhooting him dead at my Feet.</p>
            <p>The Slaves, ſeeing their Maſter fall, ran yelling back again into the Garden. I took up his Scimitar, and made the beſt of my way after our People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When we came to our Boat, we puſh'd away, as faſt as ever we cou'd, for there was no Time to be loſt; we cou'd eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive the City was alarm'd, by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſeveral Guns, and the Lights that gleam'd over the Points of the Rocks. We imagin'd the young <hi>Turk</hi> that ruſh'd out of the Garden, when we were going in, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Notice to the City, which we ſuppos'd to be the young <hi>Engliſh Mahometan,</hi> my Brother mention'd in his Relation.</p>
            <p>One of the Two, we left to look after the Boat, was a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Surgeon, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately dreſs'd my Brother's Wound, as well as he cou'd in the Dark, but he cou'd not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me, whether there was any Danger or no,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0201000402:148"/>
till he came to have Light enough to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it more circumſpectly.</p>
            <p>The Confuſion we were all in, did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to take Notice of a young <hi>Moor</hi> that was in the Boat with us. I ask'd the Surgeon, and the other <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> that were left to look after the Boat, how the Youth came there? He told me, not long after we landed, he walk'd after us, to liſten if he cou'd hear any thing, and perceiving this young Spark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards him, with a great deal of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, he thought it was his beſt way to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him, for fear he might alarm the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I was loth, continu'd the Surgeon, to fire upon him, not knowing but there might be People near us, therefore reſolv'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him with my Cutlaſs; but as I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſault him, he fell upon his Knees, and ſpoke in ſuch a beſeeching Accent (tho' I did not underſtand a Word of his Diſcourſe) that I cou'd not have the Heart to hurt him; therefore ſecur'd him in the Boat, and in the Hurly-burly quite forgot him; for, I think, his ſeeming Innocency, and his Tears, which have never ceas'd ſince he has been with us, wou'd have prevail'd upon me to have ſet him at Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0201000402:149"/>I ſpoke to him in <hi>Lingua Franca</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> is a compound Speech, generally underſtood by the <hi>Moors</hi> on the Sea Coaſts, as well as thoſe on the Sea Coaſts of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> moſt Parts of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Iſlands.</note>, and <hi>Italian,</hi> all the Tongues I am Maſter of, but he did not underſtand me.</p>
            <p>All this time my Brother lay Senſeleſs, and his Condition almoſt brought me to Deſpair; but the Surgeon comforted me, by telling us, as ſoon as we came on Board, he had Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials that wou'd reſtore him, for he aſſur'd me he was not dead. I comforted the Fair <hi>Fatima</hi> (as I thought her to be) as well as I could; but judge my Surprize, when ſhe gave me ſuch Anſwers, that aſſur'd me ſhe was not her we had ventur'd our Lives for: The Knowledge of this, almoſt made me loſe my Senſes. I rav'd, and tore my Hair, and wou'd have thrown myſelf into the Sea, in order to ſwim back to the Shore, and recover her, or loſe my Life: But it cou'd not be; for juſt as we got on Board our Veſſel, we perceiv'd a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Galley coming out of the Port; we cut our Anchor, and made all the Sail we cou'd to get from 'em; and, as if Heaven took our Parts, a brisk Gale aroſe,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0201000402:150"/>
that was fair for our Purpoſe, ſo that when the Morning dawn'd, we loſt Sight of her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, my Brother came to his Senſes; but when he learn'd that we had fail'd of our Purpoſe, he ſwoon'd again, and every body thought he wou'd have expir'd; it was a full Hour before he open'd his Eyes, but then utter'd ſuch Complaints, as melted us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pity, that underſtood him. The Surgeon, my Governor, and I, were all ſtanding about him, perſuading him to be dreſs'd; but he utterly refus'd it: No, ſaid he, ſince my dear <hi>Fatima</hi> is loſt for ever, 'tis in vain to think of perſuading me to live. Immediately after this, we were ſurpris'd to ſee the young <hi>Moor</hi> ruſh into the Cabbin, and looking ſtedfaſtly on my Brother, give a great Shriek, and fall ſenſeleſs at my Feet. My Brother, turning his heavy Eyes that way, cry'd out, Oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! what do I ſee? Why wou'd you uſe me thus cruelly? We ſoon underſtood, by his Tranſports, that the diſguis'd Youth was his lovely <hi>Fatima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Joys were now as extravagant as our Sorrows were before. She ſoon came to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and running to the Bed where my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay, fainted away again. No Words, I am ſure, cou'd have the Force to diſcover ſo
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0201000402:151"/>
ſincere a Paſſion; and we all wept for Joy, to ſee ſuch Tenderneſs. It was ſome time before their Tranſports had Leiſure to mind thoſe about 'em; and it wou'd have continu'd longer, if the Surgeon had not let us know, it might endanger my Brother's Life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prevail'd upon her to withdraw, while his Wound was dreſs'd. I then went to make my Compliments to the other Lady, who was ſtill upon Deck in the utmoſt Confuſion; for I muſt own, the Diſappointment we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd ſhe had occaſion'd, made me entirely neglect her. I ſoon made her eaſy, and let her into ſome Part of our Story; and began to inquire, what ſtrange Fortune had brought her to thoſe Circumſtances we found her in. She related to us her ſhort Story, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I am Daughter to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, that has reſided upwards of Ten Years at <hi>Leghorn.</hi> My Father had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to one of his Countrymen that liv'd at <hi>Naples:</hi> He came to <hi>Leghorn</hi> to ſee me, we lik'd each other, and were marry'd. My Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being oblig'd to go to <hi>Venice</hi> by Land, I was embark'd in a <hi>Felucca</hi> for <hi>Naples</hi>; but a Storm came upon us, that drove us from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0201000402:152"/>
our Courſe. We were taken by a <hi>Corſair</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> where I was ſold to a young <hi>Moor,</hi> who intended me for his <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But I was reſolv'd ſooner to ſuffer Death, than yield to his Embraces. Laſt Night, he was reſolv'd to force me, if I wou'd not comply willingly to his baſe Deſires, and was going to execute his horrible Purpoſe, the Moment you enter'd the Garden; but the Cries of his Slaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming him, he ran to his Arms, and left me. I hearing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue ſpoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, hop'd you might be Chriſtians diſguis'd (as it prov'd) therefore reſolv'd to put myſelf in your Hands, not knowing any thing of the Miſtake, which Heaven has, I hope, brought to a joyful End. I ſhall ever acknowledge the Bleſſing I have receiv'd from you; and I am aſſur'd, both my Father and Husband will return you ſuitable Thanks for redeeming me from Infamy and Slavery; and if you think fit to put my Ranſom at Ten Thouſand Crowns, I'll engage it ſhall be paid, either at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> or <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I let her know we were Gentlemen, above ſuch mercenary Ends; and I ſhou'd think the Obligation ſufficiently paid, by ſending her to her Father, or Husband, which ſhe thought
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0201000402:153"/>
fit, when we arriv'd at <hi>Genoa.</hi> I might have known indeed, reply'd the Lady, by your Countenances and Actions, you are not of the vulgar Strain; however, I hope you'll be ſo good to acquaint me who are my Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that I may ever remember you in my Prayers, and wiſh you eternal Felicity in this World, and the next. I let her know, I wou'd take an Opportunity to ſatisfy her, when my Brother was out of Danger. His Hurt mended every Hour, and before we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Genoa,</hi> he cou'd, with the help of a Cane, walk upon Deck in calm Weather. As we ſet out ſecretly from thence, we took care to be as ſecret in our returning back.</p>
            <p>I rewarded our Men above their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' not more than I thought they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; for it muſt be own'd, our Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was very hazardous, and the Succeſs was far beyond, even my Hopes, neither had we any one that receiv'd the leaſt Hurt, but my Brother. When I ſhew'd him the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar of the <hi>Moor</hi> I had ſlain, he ſoon knew it to be that of his barbarous Maſter's, as he call'd him; and the fair <hi>Fatima</hi> cou'd not hear the Death of her cruel Brother (tho' born of different Mothers) without ſhedding Tears, which only ſhew'd the Excellency of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0201000402:154"/>
for ſure, ſhe had Reaſon enough to wiſh his Death.</p>
            <p>She told us, when ſhe heard he had ſold my Brother to the Captain of the Corſair, it gave her an infinite Satisfaction, for ſhe knew thoſe ſort of Perſons underſtood the Value of Money ſo well, they wou'd be eaſily prevail'd upon to part with any thing, for that ſhining Droſs. I ſent that very Night (ſaid <hi>Fatima,</hi> relating her Story) to the <hi>Jew,</hi> an Account of what had befell the Slave he was to redeem, with a ſtrict Charge to finiſh the Affair the next Day. The next Morning, as I was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alone, with all my Thoughts employ'd about my Love, and caſting about my Eſcape, for I was aſſur'd of my dear <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, my old Slave interrupted my Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with the fatal News of his being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd away the Night before. The Terrors I felt, took away my Senſes, and I continu'd ſeveral Hours in a Swoon. When I reviv'd, my Tears flow'd inceſſantly, and my faithful Slave, with all her Good-nature, cou'd not give me any Conſolation. It was two Days before I cou'd be prevail'd upon to take any Nouriſhment. But the <hi>Jew</hi> inform'd my old Slave, that the Corſair did not intend to make more than a Four Months Voyage; therefore
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0201000402:155"/>
having ſome faint Hopes of ſeeing my Love again, I reſolv'd to live till the Time was expir'd.</p>
            <p>During that tedious Time, my Life was made more uneaſy, by the barbarous Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Brother, who was reſolv'd to wed me to one of his Acquaintance, that, as he often ſaid, he might get rid of one he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He brought him to ſee me, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cuſtom of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and I had the Ill-fortune to pleaſe him too well. I need not tell you, that Brothers, among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> have an abſolute Command over their Siſters, and the Wives of their deceas'd Father. Therefore the Day was fix'd for our Nuptials, which was to have been three Days after I had made my Eſcape. After that barbarous Decree, my Brother gave me more Liberty than uſual; therefore I had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of conveying a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit into the little Summer-Houſe, where I had often convers'd with the Charmer of my Soul, the Key of which I had kept ever ſince the Death of my Father. By degrees, I carry'd all my Gold and Jewels there; and that very Night you came to relieve me, was the Night I had fix'd upon for my Eſcape, (firſt giving my old faithful Slave her Liberty, with a Sum
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0201000402:156"/>
of Money, to make her meanly happy for the reſt of her Life, even with my Brother's Conſent.) I had but juſt dreſs'd myſelf, and ſecur'd my little Fortune, when I was alarm'd with a confus'd Noiſe of People in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and imagining they were coming to ſeize me, ruſh'd out of the Gate, and flew, as faſt as my weak Limbs wou'd permit me; yet, in the Terrors of my Apprehenſions, I knew not where I was going. I muſt own, I was very much frighted at meeting a Stranger, yet I thought it was better than falling into the Hands of any of the People of <hi>Tunis.</hi> I ſoon knew you were upon ſome clandeſtine Deſign; tho' every Body ſpeaking <hi>Italian,</hi> I cou'd not underſtand what was ſpoke; and the Thoughts of what Fortune might attend me, gave me many terrible and uneaſy Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
            <p>The Appearance of a wounded Perſon, and the Sight of a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Lady (as I took her to be, you brought along with you) ſoon convinc'd me you had ſucceeded in your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. I did intend to diſcover myſelf to her, hoping ſhe wou'd give me her Protection. I ſpoke to her in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language, but was ſurpriz'd to find I was not underſtood. And immediately after, perceiving the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0201000402:157"/>
that ſpread itſelf over all your Faces, I cou'd not help endeavouring to find it out; imagining I heard <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſpoke among you, doubled my Curioſity. I need not tell you my Surprize, when I heard the Voice of my dear <hi>Vaughan</hi> repeat my Name, whoſe lov'd Accents were ever in my Ears. You ſaw the violent Working of my Soul, and brought me from Death to Life, a Life of Joy and Tranſport.</p>
            <p>The unlook'd-for Happineſs of theſe four Lovers, made me once more think of my own uncertain Fate, and of my dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who was never from my Thoughts.</p>
            <p>My Uncle's Intention, at firſt, was, that I ſhou'd make the whole Tour of <hi>Italy</hi>; but the unfortunate End of my dear Father, was the Cauſe of his deſiring my immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as he mention'd in my laſt Letter; and I can't but own, maugre my Curioſity, which was very prevalent, I was pleas'd to think I ſhou'd ſee my dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> before the tedious Time prefix'd for my Return.</p>
            <p>Finding no Veſſel ready to carry us to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> where we had agreed to go by Sea, we embark'd for <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and the rather, that we might return the Lady we had brought
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0201000402:158"/>
from <hi>Tunis,</hi> ſafe among her Friends. We embark'd on Board a <hi>Felucca,</hi> but had the Mortification to find the young Nobleman in the Veſſel, bound for <hi>Leghorn</hi> (the Relation of my Governor's, mention'd before.) Our Uneaſineſs was the more on the Account of the Fair <hi>Eliza,</hi> who never durſt appear upon Deck, notwithſtanding her Diſguiſe, for fear of being known by him; neither wou'd my Governor once come in his Sight. And, to add to my Misfortune, I was oblig'd to ſhare Cabbins with him, or lie upon Deck.</p>
            <p>During our ſhort Voyage, he ſeem'd good-natur'd, to a Degree; but was ſo officiouſly Talkative and Troubleſome, he was hardly to be bore, ever plaguing me with Stories of his ſucceſsful Amours.</p>
            <p>I was (ſaid he) deſperately in Love with a Lady at <hi>Genoa,</hi> who, ſuſpecting I had a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for another Woman, whom, I muſt own, I had an Affair with when firſt I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, wou'd not let me alone before I had wrote her a Letter, to convince her of my Coolneſs. But not underſtanding the <hi>Italian</hi> Language well enough to write my ſelf, I was oblig'd to employ a Countryman of ours to write it for me, which I tranſcrib'd; and by the Conſequence that follow'd (for I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0201000402:159"/>
ſhou'd have been murder'd, if I had ſtaid any longer at <hi>Genoa</hi>) I believe I had not fair Play from my Friend, in the Tranſlation. I know you are a Maſter of that Language, and I ſhou'd take it for a ſingular Favour, if you wou'd once more render it into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that I may be a better Judge of my Countryman's Sincerity. I muſt own, I took it from him to tranſlate, that I might be rid of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for ſome time. The Contents of this fine Letter were as follows:

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0201000402:160"/>

            <p>The Senſe of this Letter, gave me a more deſpicable Opinion of the Fool that wrote it; and I muſt own, the Trouble I was forc'd to endure, in having his impertinent Company, gave me very much Uneaſineſs; for, during our Voyage, I was oblig'd to appear as a Stranger to my Brother, my Governor, and the Ladies, for fear he ſhou'd come to know 'em. But our Arrival at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> after a Voyage of Five Days, gave me ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for as ſoon as he landed, he took a Poſt-Chaiſe for <hi>Florence,</hi> and rid us of his moſt troubleſome Company: Tho' he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0201000402:161"/>
in a Week, and went back in the ſame Veſſel for <hi>Genoa</hi> again. I muſt own, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners may juſtly have a Contempt for our Nation, when too many that travel, have the ſame Sentiments with this young Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we landed, we conducted the Lady to her Father's Houſe, where we found the whole Family in Mourning. We did not immediately diſcover her to him, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended our Buſineſs with him, was only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to a Houſe, where we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, during our Stay in <hi>Leghorn.</hi> He told us, if we cou'd be contented with a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Family, we might make uſe of his Houſe, as if it were our own. We thank'd him for the Favour, and, by degrees, got out of him the Reaſon of his Mourning. My Brother, being a Man of ſome Mirth, told him, he believ'd, by the Art of Divination, he cou'd, in leſs than Five Minutes, inform him whether he ſhou'd ever ſee his Daughter again, and the Day and the Hour of their Meeting: But the Merchant expreſs'd ſome Uneaſineſs, as imagining my Brother made a Jeſt of his Sorrows: Nay, Sir (ſaid my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor) don't look grave at what the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man propoſes to you, for I can aſſure you he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0201000402:162"/>
has an admirable Knowledge that way. What my Governor ſaid, ſeem'd only to add to his Confuſion. Pray, Sir, ſaid I, tell me one Thing, is your Son-in-law here, or at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?</hi> Gentlemen (return'd our kind Hoſt) I muſt own, you look like ſuch, pray don't laugh at the Misfortunes of a mourning Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whoſe Diſtreſs is never to be forgot; my unfortunate Son-in-law is now in the Houſe with me, but ſuch a Picture of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, that cannot be look'd on without Compaſſion; and I fear his Death, in a very ſhort time, will add to our Mourning. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think, the unexpected Sight of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might be as prejudicial as their Sorrow; therefore told him, in a few Words, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the Adventure of the Lady, and fetch'd her out of a Room where ſhe was conceal'd, and had heard all, to throw herſelf at his Feet. When ſhe appear'd, he ſtood fix'd in Aſtoniſhment for ſome time; but when he was convinc'd it was his Daughter that knelt before him, the Tears of Joy guſh'd out ſo faſt, that ſtopt the Utterance of his Tongue. When his extravagant Tranſport was a little abated, he went up to his Son-in-law, and after ſtaying ſome time, brought him down with him; he appear'd the very Shadow of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0201000402:163"/>
Form; and notwithſtanding he had been prepar'd for the tender Interview, as ſoon as he enter'd the Room, he ſunk, ſpeechleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father-in-law's Arms. We thought it proper to retire into another Apartment, during this dumb Scene. It was ſome time before they came to us, but the Redundancy of their Gratitude had almoſt overwhelm'd us. We intended to ſtay but three or four Days at <hi>Leghorn</hi>

Sir, ſaid the <hi>Italian,</hi> I found they were in a Language I did not underſtand, and, not knowing the Conſequence, I ſeal'd 'em up, and left 'em at my Lodgings, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for you, or the young Gentleman that ſhar'd my Cabbin with you, imagining one of you wou'd ſearch after 'em, before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Genoa,</hi> where I have been twice ſince I brought you to <hi>Leghorn</hi>; and if I had not met you accidentally Yeſterday, I ſhou'd have committed them to the Flames, before I went back to <hi>Genoa.</hi> I thank'd him for his Civility; and opening the Packet, found they were directed for my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companion, I had in the <hi>Felucca,</hi> againſt my Will. I laid 'em among my other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, not having any Curioſity to peruſe 'em, with an Intention to give 'em the right Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if ever I ſhould have the Misfortune to ſee him again. But when I told my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Brother, at Dinner, of my Packet, they ſeem'd willing to know the Contents, that they might have a farther Occaſion to deſpiſe the Gentleman, or at leaſt to make themſelves merry with his fine Epiſtles. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, we went to my Apartment, and

and I know not what Stuff. Dinning ever in my Ears, that Nobility, without Virtue, was like an eminent barren Mountain, ſeen, and ſlighted.</p>
                     <p>I have, once more, made my Addreſſes to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with all the glaring Equipage of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Fortune, but ſhe's as cold as a Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But I have found out the Reaſon of that Coldneſs. It ſeems ſhe's damnably in Love with that young learned Blockhead, <hi>Vaughan.</hi> I'll tell you how I came by that Knowledge. In one of my Viſits at her Mother's Houſe, I was told the young Lady had been ſome time in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; I made no Scruple of following her. But, you muſt think, I was ſomething ſurpriz'd to find her aſleep in a retir'd Arbor, with a Letter in her Hand, from that wretched Coxcomb you and I have ſo often laugh'd at, who ſhou'd have been well whip'd by me for his Impudence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went from <hi>England,</hi> but that I thought it was beneath me to chaſtiſe a School-Boy.</p>
                     <p>I took away the Letter, without any manner of Ceremony, and ſhew'd it to her Mother and Aunt; but was very much ſurpriz'd, to find they had no Reſentment againſt <hi>Vaughan,</hi> nor the Girl, for ſuch a Diſcovery; tho' I found it was new to them. They both coolty told me,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0201000402:169"/>
                        <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Inclinations ſhou'd never be forc'd; yet if I cou'd gain her Conſent, theirs would ſoon follow. In ſhort, there's nothing to be done with the young Girl; and I own, I think I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Reading of this Letter, gave me the moſt horrid Apprehenſions my Soul ever knew. I call'd to mind the Letter I tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Italian,</hi> at the Deſire of that Wretch, not doubting, in the leaſt, but that was the Engine, made to deſtroy all my Peace. In the firſt Tranſports of my Fury, I ſaid, and did the moſt extravagant things imaginable, to the Surprize of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>The firſt Letter was directed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the ſecond to <hi>Genoa.</hi> My Brother caſting his Eyes curſorily over the ſecond, I perceiv'd his Colour change, ſeeming very unwilling to read it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Receiv'd your laſt Packet with more Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, than I ever felt from the ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Embraces of a Miſtreſs. I think your Policy in over-reaching that contemptible Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, <hi>Vaughan,</hi> exceeds even <hi>Machiavel,</hi> for Cunning; and I don't doubt but breathing the ſame Air, and being in the ſame Climate where that Prince of Politicians was born, inſpir'd you. But I muſt tell you, how Fortune aſſiſted me in carrying on the Deceit.</p>
                  <p>You know the Letter <hi>Vaughan</hi> tranſlated, by your Inſtigation, was not ſeal'd. I, by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was at <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Mother's, where I met the Uncle of <hi>Vaughan:</hi> I took an Occaſion to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his Seal, and with it ſeal'd that Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>Iſabella;</hi> their Arms being the ſame, you may be aſſur'd, it help'd my Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Two Days after this, I got truſty <hi>Roger,</hi> my cunning Dog of a Footman, to put on a Sailor's Dreſs, and deliver the Letter to <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> when I was preſent. I had order'd him to tell her, he receiv'd that Letter, with many others, from ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa.</hi> The young Lady bluſh'd, and trembled, when ſhe receiv'd it, viewing the Seal very circumſpectly; but the Hand of the Direction
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0201000402:172"/>
not being the ſame that was expected from the Seal, ſhe ſeem'd to be in the utmoſt Conſternation: However, there was no one to make Obſervations upon her Looks, but myſelf, her Mother and Aunt being gone, ſome Moments before <hi>Roger</hi> came with the Letter, to dreſs themſelves, in order to make a Viſit, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> was to go along with them. The young Lady went into the Garden, in order to read the dear Epiſtle with more Freedom, and ſtaid ſo long there, that the Mother, with the Aunt, came down dreſt, order'd the Coach to the Door, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd after her. I told 'em, a Sailor had brought the young Lady a Letter from <hi>Genoa,</hi> from one, I ſuppos'd, ſhe was very glad to hear from, for ſhe chang'd Countenance ſeveral times, then went to the Garden to enjoy the Contents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The Mother and Aunt ſeem'd very much diſturb'd at my ſhort Story, and follow'd <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> into the Garden, without giving me one Word in return. Some Moments after, I was a little ſurpriz'd, I own, to ſee the Aunt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in great Haſte, calling to the Servants for Water. The Houſe was all in an Uproar, and I ſoon underſtood <hi>Iſabella</hi> was in a fainting Fit. This gave me ſome little Uneaſineſs, to think ſhe lov'd another ſo well; yet I bury'd it ſoon, knowing violent Paſſions never laſt long.</p>

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0201000402:173"/>
                     <hi>Iſabella</hi> was brought in by the Servants, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Appearance, void of Life, with the Mother and Aunt weeping over her. They put her to Bed; but as faſt as ſhe recover'd out of one fainting Fit, ſhe fell into another. In ſhort, the Family was in ſo much Diſtraction, for ſeveral Hours, that I thought it proper to retire without Ceremony, feeding on the Hopes this Diſturbance would produce.</p>
                  <p>I ſent, the next Morning, to inquire of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s Health, and was inform'd, ſhe was in a violent Fever. The Meſſenger brought me a Note from the Aunt, that told me, <hi>her Niece was often troubled with a bad Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and thoſe fainting Fits were too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with her, yet that was the worſt ſhe ever had,</hi> &amp;c. I own, my dear <hi>Ned,</hi> I cou'd not help ſmiling at the Note; but however, I found by it, they intended the true Reaſon ſhould be a Secret, and, you know, it was my Intereſt, not to divulge it.</p>
                  <p>In about ten Days after this Affair, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to make 'em another Viſit, where I found <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſo much alter'd, that, in reality, I pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd her. She look'd as if ſhe was going to her Grave; but, notwithſtanding her Paleneſs, her Charms were as powerful as ever; and I own, I love her more and more, every time I ſee her.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0201000402:174"/>
One thing gave me infinite Pleaſure at this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit; I obſerv'd her Looks were not ſo full of Scorn, when ſhe caſt her Eyes upon me. I did not mention my Paſſion for ſeveral Days; but the Reſpect I treated her with, and the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I expreſs'd for her melancholy Indiſpoſition, ſeem'd grateful to all the Family.</p>
                  <p>When I once more mention'd my Love, <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> only ſigh'd, and ſhed Tears, but did not rally me, as ſhe was wont to do. In ſhort, I follow'd my Buſineſs ſo cloſe, that the whole Family gave me their Conſent, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> now treats me as her future Husband. She has freely declar'd to me, the Paſſion ſhe once had for <hi>Vaughan;</hi> and only begs our Nuptials may be delay'd, till ſhe can wholly give me that Heart, the other ſo little deſerv'd. This Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is no Secret, tho' the Cauſe is not known out of the Family. <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Uncle has been very much buſy'd about ſome Concerns of his Brother's Family, who is lately dead, together with his Wife, and a Son of hers. And it is whiſper'd in the Neighbourhood, as if ſome poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning Work had been done in the Family by the Wife, tho' ſhe has ſuffer'd herſelf. I only wiſh the Knowledge of it, when it reaches your raw Traveller, may prove a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to convey him into another World, for fear our Plot
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0201000402:175"/>
ſhould be diſcover'd. However, when I have wedded <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I ſhall take care to put Bounds to her Liberty, I mean, if my Love ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue after Wedlock, which I begin to think no impoſſible thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Uncle, this Morning, came to pay his Reſpects to the Family, as uſual; but the Mother, the Aunt, and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> order'd the Servants to ſay they were abroad. The old Gentleman return'd home, ſomething chagrin'd. I ſuppoſe his Viſits there, for the future, will be thought only a Trouble to the Family. My dear <hi>Ned,</hi> I ſhan't write to you any more, till our Nuptials are over, which I hope will be in two Months at the fartheſt. However, let me know where you intend to be, that I may be ſure where my Epiſtle may find you. And I wiſh thee as happy with thy <hi>Italian</hi> Dames, as I hope to be in two Months in the Embraces of the charming <hi>Iſabella:</hi> And, next to her, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd to ſhare the Heart of</p>

            <p>At the Reading of this villainous Letter, all my Fortitude, Reſolution, and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy left me; my diſorder'd Soul whiſper'd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0201000402:176"/>
my Heart to put an end to my wretched Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I had certainly done, if the Thoughts of Revenge had not bid me live. I immediately gave Orders for my Journey to <hi>England,</hi> but my impatient Fancy outrun all Expedition; Yet the Tumult of my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, threw me into another violent Fever; and tho' every one thought it would be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death, to remove from the Place where I was, yet I order'd a Litter; and the next Morning purſu'd my Journey, attended with my Governor, <hi>Eliza,</hi> my Brother, the fair <hi>Fatima,</hi> and Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eliza,</hi> in our firſt Day's Journey, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a ſudden Indiſpoſition, that prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our going any further that Day. We were far from any Town, and it was with great Difficulty we found Accommodation at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Village, a Mile from the main Road. I was agitated with ſo much impatient Paſſion, that my Friends found it a hard Task to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me from leaving them behind, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing my Journey with my two Servants. The next Morning, <hi>Eliza</hi> was much better; but, to my great Mortification, I was ſo weak, that I had not Strength enough to riſe without Help; yet, notwithſtanding my Condition, I order'd my Litter to be got
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0201000402:177"/>
ready, but was inform'd, the Men went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with it back to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> early in the Morning. I loſt all Patience at the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and fell out with my Friends; not doubting (tho' they deny'd it) but it was their Contrivance, to prevent my Journey during my Weakneſs. In ſhort, my Illneſs redoubled its Attacks, and took ſuch ſtrong Poſſeſſion of the Outworks, that it was the Opinion of every one about me, my Life could not hold out much longer. My Senſes left me, and a ſtrong Diſtraction ſeiz'd my Soul. But even in thoſe Fits of Madneſs, Revenge was uppermoſt; for they inform'd me, when I came out of thoſe Poſſeſſions, all my Ravings were upon <hi>Iſabella</hi> and my Rival, threatning Death to Both.</p>
            <p>The Place where we were, had but little Accommodation for us, even in Health, and much leſs for a Perſon in my Condition; therefore my Brother, unknown to me, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to a neighbouring Gentleman, who freely granted us the Uſe of his Houſe. I was remov'd there; and having the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the beſt Phyſicians from <hi>Florence,</hi> my Diſtemper, by degrees, left me; but I ſtill continu'd in ſuch a weak Condition, it was impoſſible for me to remove, ſo ſoon as my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0201000402:178"/>
Impatience wou'd have me. I was well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, the Time affix'd for the fatal Nuptials was elaps'd, therefore my Heart began to feel ſome Eaſe in the Reſolution I had taken in the Revenging the Loſs of my Love, by the Death of my hated Rival, or falling a Victim to my Misfortunes. This Hope gave me room to gather ſome Strength, which in a few Days increas'd ſo much, that I cou'd walk in the Garden, which was one of thoſe noble ones in <hi>Italy,</hi> that ſurpaſs even many Princes in other Countries. But what was my Surprize! when, in a neighbouring Arbor, I heard the Voice of that Wretch, ſinging an <hi>Italian</hi> Air, who by his damnable Wiles, had prevail'd upon me to tranſlate that Letter, which was the ſole Cauſe of all my Misfortunes. My Fury gave me Strength enough to fly to the Place from whence I heard his deteſted Voice. As ſoon as I came near him, I could not help crying out, with the utmoſt Tranſport of Fury, Villain! thy laſt Moment is approaching! I never once conſider'd I had no other Weapon than a Cane, to aſſiſt me in walking, which I thruſt againſt his Breaſt with ſuch Violence, that he fell backwards in a mighty Fright. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, finding it was no offenſive Weapon I
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0201000402:179"/>
had in my Hand, he drew his Sword, and made ſeveral Thruſts at me, which I parry'd with my Cane for ſome time; and at laſt, with much Difficulty, diſarm'd him. But the Violence of the Exerciſe being too ſtrong for my weak Condition, I fell to the Ground almoſt Senſeleſs. The Wretch ſeeing that, recover'd his Sword, and, with all his Strength, ſtabb'd me thro' the Shoulder; the Sword enter'd ſo far into the Earth, that he made ſeveral fruitleſs Attempts to pull it out again. I had juſt Senſe enough to know what he was doing, without any Power to prevent him. But my Brother <hi>Jonathan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Inſtant, put an end to his vain Efforts, by laying him breathleſs at my Feet, with a Blow of his Sword. He then came to my Aſſiſtance, leaving the Wretch wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in his Blood. The Family, and my Friends, were ſoon alarm'd; tho 'no one cou'd come to the true Knowledge of this Quarrel for the preſent; but the Appearances ſeem'd ſtrong againſt the other, becauſe I had no Sword. However, the Gentleman of the Houſe took care of him, as having ſome ſmall Acquaintance with him. He inform'd us, that the villainous Wretch waited for a Servant that he had ſent to <hi>Leghorn</hi> for a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0201000402:180"/>
Packet of Letters, which I too well knew were thoſe the Captain deliver'd to me. When my Wound was dreſt, I inform'd the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of all that befell me. When he heard his barbarous Policy to undo my Peace, he exclaim'd againſt his Conduct, vowing never to give him any Countenance for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>My Wound was not dangerous, tho' the Loſs of Blood contributed to my Weakneſs; but the Wretch that gave it me, ſeem'd in a very dangerous Condition; for the Blow my Brother gave him, had fractur'd his Skull, and the Violence of the Pain often took away his Senſes. Yet, in his Intervals, he talk'd of nothing but Revenge, declaring to every one that came to viſit him, my Brother's Blood ſhould make Atonement for the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſuffer'd. As for myſelf, he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently puniſh'd me, in being the Inſtrument of robbing me of all that cou'd make me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this World. I muſt own, I was in ſome Fear for my Brother; therefore was for leaving the Place as ſoon as poſſible. But the <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman, in whoſe Houſe we were, advis'd us not to purſue our Journey by Land. He laid before me the many Difficulties we ſhou'd meet with, and convinc'd me we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0201000402:181"/>
ſhou'd make our Voyage ſooner, by imbark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and travelling thro <hi>France</hi> by Land. The <hi>Alps,</hi> at this Time of the Year, he aſſur'd us, were cover'd with Snow, and many had periſh'd by miſtaking the Road. The Conſideration of the two Ladies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon me more than any Danger I fear'd; therefore we were determin'd, as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to return to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and procure a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to carry us to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>

            <p>My Wound was ſo well heal'd in ſix Days after I receiv'd it, that the ſeventh, I reſolv'd with my Companions to venture on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, in order to return to <hi>Leghorn.</hi> But when the Time came, my Brother was not to be found. We made all the Enquiry imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to no purpoſe; but what gave me ſome ſmall Satisfaction, was, that <hi>Fatima</hi> aſſur'd me he was gone to <hi>Leghorn,</hi> to provide a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for our Voyage. I own, I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd he had not inform'd us of his Deſign; but as the fair <hi>Fatima</hi> ſeem'd very eaſy, I thought I had no Reaſon to be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>We took Leave of our friendly <hi>Italian</hi>; tho', I muſt own, I parted with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret from that infamous Wretch, who was the Cauſe of all my Sorrows, without giving him the Puniſhment due to his Crimes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0201000402:182"/>
I did not doubt but the Juſtiee of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would overtake him; and I found ſome Conſolation in overcoming my juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We purſu'd our Journey for <hi>Leghorn,</hi> where we arriv'd the next Day, without any Accident; but, upon Enquiry after my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we cou'd learn no News of him. I began then to be very uneaſy; and obſerv'd a Gloom on <hi>Fatima</hi>'s Countenance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all her Endeavours to conceal it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days paſt in this Uncertainty, till <hi>Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s Fears began to be too powerful for her Prudence; yet all my Perſuaſions cou'd not get the Reaſon of my Brother's Abſence from her, tho' ſhe confeſs'd to me, ſhe knew it. My Governor, <hi>Eliza,</hi> and I, had many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, but none could give us any Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially ſince we obſerv'd <hi>Fatima</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be inconſolable, and confeſs'd, his Stay was beyond the Time prefix'd. We preſs'd her on all ſides, to declare to us the Reaſon of his unexpected Abſence, with this Perſuaſion, that it was poſſible the Knowledge of it might be of Service to him; but all our Intreaties prov'd ineffectual: Yet ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, if we had no Tidings of him in two Day, ſhe wou'd confeſs to us the Secret.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0201000402:183"/>We went to Bed, full of Terrors, and for my own Part, Sleep was a Stranger to me. But, in the middle of the Night, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd with a violent Knocking at the Gate; the Servants of the Houſe not riſing at the ſecond Alarm, I ſlipt on my Gown, and with my Sword in my Hand, went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Court-Yard; but gueſs my Surprize, when, asking, <hi>Who was there?</hi> I heard my Brother's Voice. I open'd the Gate, and my Surprize was doubled, when I found my Brother on Horſeback, at the Head of a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a ſick Man in it, attended by four Servants: But, when I found the Perſon within it, was the Wretch that had wounded me in the Garden of the <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman, my Wonder ty'd up my Tongue, and my Company (who by this time were come to us) ſtood like ſo many Statues ſtruck with the Sight of <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head. At laſt, obſerving my Brother's Diligence in helping him out of the Litter, in a ſeeming Trance, we all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily, gave him our Aſſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what we were doing. We put him into Bed, and then follow'd my Brother out of the Room (leaving his Servants and a Surgeon with him, that came in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0201000402:184"/>
without ſpeaking a Word, ſo full of Wonder, that our Tongues ſeem'd of no Uſe to us.</p>
            <p>When we came down into the Hall, my Brother tenderly embrac'd us all; tho' his dear <hi>Fatima</hi> could not ſpeak, yet the Tears of Joy that fell from her fair Eyes, convinc'd us all of the tender Love ſhe bore him. When we were ſeated ſome time, gazing ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently at one another, my Brother began his Story as follows.</p>
            <p>My dear Brother, I muſt firſt beg your Pardon for concealing from you what I am going to relate; but my Reaſon for it was, that you wou'd not have given your Conſent to what I deſign'd to do. Two Days before we intended to leave our friendly <hi>Italian,</hi> I receiv'd that Letter, (which he gave me to read,)

All I fear is, that this Notice will make you fly from my juſt Reſentment; but no Place on Earth ſhall hide you from my Chaſtiſement. My Rage ſhou'd correct your Brother for his Ill-manners, in reading thoſe Letters, you were all well aſſur'd belong'd to me. But I know his Curioſity carry'd his Puniſhment along with it. Yet when I have, with my Sword, let out your Treachery and Baſeneſs, I may think it worth my while to ſcourge him for that Folly, that can have no other Excuſe than the childiſh Curioſity of a Boy, who left his School before he had been well whipp'd for his Impertinence.</p>

            <p>This Letter was given me (continu'd my Brother) by a Servant, who told me he was order'd by his Maſter, to wait the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame Place, for an Anſwer. The Letter, I own, gave me much Concern. I advis'd with my dear <hi>Fatima,</hi> and with much Difficulty, got her Conſent to ſend an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in which I promis'd to meet him at the Time and Place appointed. I aſſur'd <hi>Fatima</hi> I would be with you in eight Days, at the fartheſt; and for that time, ſhe gave me her Word to keep the Affair a Secret from every one. The Morning I parted from her, was with the utmoſt Sorrow. She took her Leave of me, as if ſhe was never to ſee me more. I retir'd, with my Servant, full of Grief, to the little Cottage upon the Skirts of the Mead,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0201000402:187"/>
where I gave myſelf up to examine my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and endeavour'd to make my Peace with Heaven; tho' I own to you, I thought I was going to do a Deed, not in the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. As ſoon as the appointed Morning came, I aroſe, giving my Servant Orders to obſerve the Combat; and if it was my Fate to fall, he ſhou'd immediately repair to you (after laying me in the Earth) and give you an Account of my End.</p>
            <p>About Six o' Clock, I perceiv'd my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, coming ſlow and penſive along the Skirts of the Meadow. When he came near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to me, I obſerv'd he had been weeping. Tears, ſaid I, can make but poor Atonement for the many Injuries thou haſt heap'd upon my poor Brother and Me; therefore, betake thee to thy Sword, that I may chaſtiſe thy Perfidy. He made me no Anſwer, but draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword, I made a full Paſs at him, which he, opening his Arms, receiv'd into his Breaſt, and fell towards me, upon his Face, with the Point of my Sword out at his Back. I was very much ſurpriz'd at his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Proceeding; and calling my Servant, who waited at ſome Diſtance, we both rais'd him up. Forbear, ſaid he, and think not of giving Aſſiſtance to a Wretch, that rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0201000402:188"/>
Death from your Hands, and who came on purpoſe to be puniſh'd for all thoſe Crimes, the Heat of Youth, and want of Thought, have made me commit. I had no other way to recompenſe all thoſe Ills I have done your worthy Brother, but to receive Death from your Hands. The Wound you formerly gave me, prob'd me to the Soul; my Illneſs gave me Leiſure to think, and Thought was my Monitor. I knew what I had done, inſtigated by One, whoſe Nobility is a Stain to Virtue, was the baſeſt Act I could have committed. I had no other Method to meet with the Death I deſired, but by writing that Letter to you. I had not the Aſſurance to look your injur'd Brother in the Face. But I beg, by Honour, Virtue, and all the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Train of Goodneſs, to plead for me to your noble Brother, whoſe Virtues rank him above Nobility. I conſider'd my Crime no more than a little Artifice, which would be approv'd by all the laughing Part of the World. But when I weigh'd it fully in my Illneſs, I found it the baſeſt, blackeſt, and moſt inhuman Policy, that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by mortal Man. I often us'd to whiſper to myſelf, What Anxiety have I felt, even for a Diſappointment of a Day! But
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0201000402:189"/>
what muſt theſe two poor, virtuous, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, abus'd Souls ſuffer, even to the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Mortality! My Wound was never ſo dangerous as reported. But the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my troubled Conſcience, perſuaded even the Surgeon, that I was often delirious, when alas! all my Madneſs was in my Mind, and not in the Brain. I purpoſely, when I was calm, threaten'd Revenge upon you; but it was only that you might be inform'd of my falſe Reſentment againſt you, I well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your Spirit would find ſome Means to ſeek me out, and puniſh me for my Crime as I deſerv'd. Even the Letter I wrote to you, went to my Soul, becauſe what I wrote was againſt my Conſcience. All I deſire of you, is, to bury me obſcurely, and let my Faults be forgotten in the Grave. He endeavour'd to ſay more, but his Tongue falter'd, his Eyes clos'd, and, grafping me faintly by the Hand, he ſunk to the Earth, in all Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance never to riſe again. We took him in our Arms, and, with the Sword in his Breaſt, carry'd him to the Cottage, and then ſent my Servant for the Surgeon, that attended you both in your Illneſs. While he was gone, there ſeem'd no ſign of Life in him. I muſt confeſs, his unhappy Condition had wip'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0201000402:190"/>
all Reſentment in me, and I felt for him all the Tenderneſs of a Brother and Friend, waſhing his Face with my repentant Tears, often curſing myſelf for the raſh Act.</p>
            <p>When the Surgeon came, he drew the Sword out of his Body, upon which he open'd his Eyes, fetching a deep Sigh, but clos'd 'em immediately again. However, the Surgeon prob'd his Wound, and gave me ſome Hopes it might not prove mortal. We undreſs'd him, and put him to Bed; but the Surgeon deſir'd we might leave the Room, till the Evening he came again; for he confidently aſſur'd us, by that Time, he would either be paſt Cure, or out of Danger. I own I cou'd not obey his Orders, but ſat by his Bedſide till the Evening the Surgeon return'd; and all that time, I cou'd not perceive him to breathe; therefore, I was aſſur'd in myſelf, the Soul had taken her Flight for ever. The Surgeon, by his Countenance, ſeem'd to think as I did; but when he took off his Plaiſters from his Wounds, he cry'd, Courage! Sir; we have Hopes, and great ones too. I own, thoſe Words very much chear'd my drooping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. When he had once more dreſs'd him, he forc'd open his Mouth, and pour'd in ſome Cordial, which upon the Inſtant caus'd him
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0201000402:191"/>
to groan, and ſome Moments after he open'd his Eyes, faintly looking upon us, but did not ſeem to know us. In ſhort, it was four Days ere he came to his Senſes; and then the Surgeon declar'd he was out of Danger, ſince in that time he had eſcap'd a Fever.</p>
            <p>I was ſo much concern'd for his Welfare, that I had even forgot the Time I propos'd to meet you at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> was elaps'd; therefore I ſent my Servant to acquaint you with the Reaſon of my Delay, intending to follow the next Day. But we were very much ſurpriz'd laſt Night, to find the poor Fellow ty'd to a Tree in the Road, having been robb'd of his Horſe, his Cloaths and Money, as alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely beaten into the Bargain.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Gentleman's Wounds were almoſt heal'd, yet he continu'd ſo weak, that he could not get out of his Bed without Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; yet, knowing the Neceſſity of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you, he would accompany me in the Litter that carry'd you a Day's Journey into the Country (that I had order'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in the Village, to prevent, my dear Brother, your purſuing a raſh Deſign, that muſt have ended with your Life, conſidering the Weakneſs of your Condition.) I'll wait on you, ſaid he, to your worthy Brother, to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0201000402:192"/>
obtain his Pardon, or die at his Feet. When he was inform'd we were near the Houſe where you reſided, the Thoughts of ſeeing the Face of the Perſon he had ſo heinouſly injur'd, took away his Senſes, and he faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away. But the Surgeon aſſur'd us, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reſt and Quietneſs would ſoon reſtore him; therefore deſired he might not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd for ſome Hours.</p>
            <p>When my Brother had ended his Relation, Revenge, Hate, Fury, with all the Train of violent Paſſions, left my Breaſt; and in their room, ſoft Compaſſion, Tenderneſs, with Friendſhip, took their Place. Tho' I was undone thro' his Means, yet a gloomy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment took Poſſeſſion of my Soul, ſo that I could freely pardon the Man who was the Cauſe of all my Misfortunes. I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with an ardent Longing to embrace him. All the Company felt the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with me; neither cou'd we prevent the Tears guſhing from our Eyes, at my Brother's ſhort Story.</p>
            <p>We all return'd to Reſt; and I muſt own, I had not felt the balmy Effects of Slumber ſo ſweet, for many Days. Tho' the latter Part of it was diſturb'd with a Dream of my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi>; I thought ſhe appear'd before
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0201000402:193"/>
me with thoſe piercing Rays of Beauty, with which ſhe firſt wounded my Soul. <hi>Canſt thou then forſake me</hi> (ſhe cry'd) <hi>ungrateful Wretch? What have I done to merit ſuch bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Uſage? Are theſe the Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thou madeſt me at our cruel Separation? Why didſt thou betray my eaſy Heart, to feel the Torture of Deſpair for ever? But know, thou Wretch! tho' Death will ſoon overtake me, yet I will die another's, to puniſh thee.</hi> When ſhe had (as I thought) pronounc'd theſe fatal Words, ſhe flew from me in a violent Rage, and the Agony I felt in my Dream, awak'd me in a cold Sweat, all o'er my Limbs. Tho' this was but a Dream, yet my Mind felt all the Tortures imaginable, at the Thoughts of my miſerable Fortune.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, my Brother inform'd us the Gentleman was better, and expreſs'd a great Deſire to ſee me. After Breakfaſt, we all went up together. At Sight of me, the Tears ran down his Cheeks, which choak'd the Paſſage of his Words for ſome time. For Heaven's ſake, Sir, ſaid I, do not add to my Sorrows, by making me bear yours. I know your Penitence, and it is with the utmoſt Candour I now declare, I heartily forgive what is paſt, and beg to be rank'd in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0201000402:194"/>
Number of your virtuous Friends. This Goodneſs, he faintly reply'd, had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd his Soul with ſo much Confuſion, that it was more than his feeble Spirits cou'd ſtand under; and, upon ſaying that, his Speech fail'd him, and a deadly Paleneſs overſpread his Face. It was a full Hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cou'd bring him to Life again, and I began to taſte all the Bitterneſs of Grief for his Condition. When he cou'd uſe his Tongue, he ſaid ſo many humane tender things, as plung'd all the Hearers in Floods of Sorrow, inſomuch, that the Surgeon turn'd us all out of the Chamber, declaring he would, upon the Inſtant, leave him, if we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to ſee him again, till he thought fit.</p>
            <p>Juſt as we left him, a Packet was given me from <hi>England,</hi> which I knew to be my Uncle's Hand. I had not wrote him any Letter for near four Months, having indeed almoſt forgot (thro' my Brother's Affairs, my Sickneſs, and my own unhappy Love) I had any ſuch Perſon in the World; and when I did call him to mind, the Intention of my Journey to <hi>England,</hi> made it of no Signification to write. I ſound, by the Date of the Letter, it was full ten Weeks ſince it was wrote.</p>

Uncle a Letter, for fear ſome Accident might retard our Voyage.

            <p>The wounded Gentleman, hearing we were to imbark for <hi>Marſeilles</hi> the next Morning, was reſolv'd to go with us, notwithſtanding his weak Condition, and all our Perſuaſions to the contrary, cou'd not avail.

All my Days to come, ſhall be ſpent in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Forgiveneſs from Heaven and you. Sure there muſt be the Seeds of ſome Goodneſs, even in the moſt profligate Heart, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Tears may make them flouriſh, and kill thoſe Weeds of Baſeneſs, that ſhadow'd o'er our vicious Inclinations. I wou'd not be the Wretch I was ſome few Days ago, for all the gaudy Titles of State and Grandeur.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there was ſuch a virtuous Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought upon him, I cou'd not help eſteeming him equal to my Brother. His Friendſhip was, in ſome ſort, a Cordial for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0201000402:199"/>
my diſappointed Love; for I had made a firm Reſolve, after the Loſs of my dear <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> to forget all the fatal Charms of the Sex, which, at beſt, enervate the Soul of Man, unbend his Mind, and render him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for noble Actions. I intended to dedicate my future Life to my King and Country: My new Friend ſtrengthen'd me in that Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Our Deſign was, as ſoon as we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in <hi>England,</hi> to buy us Poſts in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and make, for the future, War our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. Theſe Thoughts almoſt engroſs'd my whole Soul; but the Idea of the charming <hi>Iſabella,</hi> wou'd too often intrude, and fill my Heart with a Medley of Love and Arms.</p>
            <p>We ſet out from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in Poſt-Chaiſes, for <hi>Paris,</hi> where we all ſafely arriv'd, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Body; tho', for my own Part, with a Mind full of cruel Diſturbances. We were oblig'd to ſtay ſome time here, to diſpoſe of a Casket of valuable Jewels that <hi>Fatima</hi> brought from <hi>Tunis,</hi> and procure Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for our Money, for fear of Accidents. But as ſoon as we arriv'd there, I diſpatch'd one of my Servants for <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint my Uncle of my coming. Here my Fever attack'd me again; but I was ſo impatient to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0201000402:200"/>
come to my Journey's End, that as ſoon as our Affairs were ended, we hir'd Poſt-Chaiſes for <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> where we ſafely arriv'd, tho' late at Night, but found the Gates ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. But having Recommendations to Mr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> a Wine-Merchant, a Gentleman juſt ſettled at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> he prevail'd upon the Captain of the Guard to give us Entrance; and, thro' his accuſtom'd Good-nature, he wou'd accommodate us at his own Houſe, where we were nobly entertain'd. He preſt us ſo oblingly to ſtay ſome time, that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd almoſt guilty of Ill-manners; but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and Love, ſeldom regard Forms.</p>
            <p>He, finding our Affairs preſt us to be gone, procur'd us a Veſſel to carry us to <hi>Dover,</hi> and we embark'd the next Morning, at break of Day; but before the Sun was two Hours old, a general Darkneſs o'erſpread the Hemiſphere, follow'd by a moſt violent Tempeſt, mix'd with Thunder and Lightning, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Veſſel declar'd, he had never ſeen the like. The Helm was of no Uſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were oblig'd, under a reef'd Foreſail, to run before the Wind, truſting to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Providence for three Nights and Days. Upon the fourth, the Storm retir'd, and gave us Leave to make an Obſervation; we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0201000402:201"/>
were greatly ſurpriz'd to find we had paſs'd the <hi>Lizard.</hi> Upon this, we conſulted what Courſe we ſhould ſteer; but finding the Wind favourable for <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, the Captain was prevail'd upon, for a Sum of Money, to ſteer for that Harbour. The Night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the Tempeſt (as if it abated only to fetch Breath) came on more violently than before, and all the Hopes we had of Life, was, to ſteer our Courſe for the open Sea. Our Veſſel bore up againſt the Storm very well, for two Days; but on the third, the Maſter came into the Cabbin, with Looks that told us our Misfortune; he inform'd us, the Veſſel had ſprung a Leak, and, ſhould the Storm continue a Day longer, we muſt inevitably ſink to the Bottom.</p>
            <p>The Tears of my Friends, I muſt own, ſhock'd me very much; yet, for my own Part, I ſat in expectation of the laſt Moment, with the utmoſt Tranquillity. But in a few Hours, the Storm very much abated; yet, with all our Aſſiſtance, the Water gain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and no Land appearing, we had no Hope of ſaving our Lives.</p>
            <p>The Veſſel was, once more, left to the Mercy of the Waves, whoſe frightful Swell, tho' the Wind was laid, ran Mountains high.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0201000402:202"/>
The Maſter order'd the Long-boat out, that we might endeavour all we cou'd to ſave our Lives: But the Mariners, as ſoon as it was in the Water, crowded ſo faſt upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Rope which held it to the Ship's Side, broke, and in a Moment after, the Boat was ſwallow'd by the Billows: Three out of thirteen of the Sailors, that were in it, ſunk to the Bottom, never to be ſeen more alive. It was with the utmoſt Difficulty the reſt were ſav'd. The Sailors finding no Hope of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that way, began to throw overboard their Guns, Water-Casks, and Proviſion, and, by the Divine Providence, found out one of the Leaks, which they, with much Difficulty, ſtopt; and by continual plying the Pump, clear'd her of ſome Water: But the inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Labour fatigu'd us all ſo much, that we began to deſpair again. Yet Life being ſweet, every Perſon in the Veſſel put forth their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Strength, and labour'd hard all Night. In the Break of the Morning, we diſcover'd Land, to the inexpreſſible Joy of the Sailors, and what Wind we had, pointed fair for the Place. But our Joy had like to have been more fatal than the Storm; for upon the firſt Notice of diſcovering Land, every Perſon ran upon Deck, like Madmen, to be confirm'd
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0201000402:203"/>
in the pleaſing News, never regarding the Pumps, till we found the Veſſel almoſt ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under us: Yet the Hope of Life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd us with new Strength. We work'd as hard, as if the Sight of Shore had been a Day's Reſt from Labour. We had no Boat to land with, therefore the Captain made a Signal of Diſtreſs, and in leſs than an Hour, we ſaw ſeveral Boats rowing towards us. The Captain wiſely conſider'd, if theſe Boats ſhould come on Board, every one would be for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into them, and leave the Veſſel to ſink for want of Working; therefore he order'd Tow-Ropes out, that the approaching Boats might lend their Aſſiſtance that way. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he acquainted the Sailors with his Intention, and they, with the Paſſengers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of it. The Boats, when they came near us, obey'd the Captain's Order, and in two Hours we arriv'd ſafe in St. <hi>Aubin</hi>'s Bay, a Harbour in the Iſland of <hi>Jerſey</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Iſland of <hi>Jerſey</hi> (in <hi>Latin, Caeſarea,</hi> from <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who gave it his own Name.) This Iſland, and <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> are all that's left to <hi>England,</hi> of their mighty <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts. It appertains to <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> having for its Church-Government, a Dean and Twelve Miniſters of the Goſpel; and for its Civil, a Bailiff, with Twelve of the chief Gentlemen of the Iſland, call'd <hi>Jurors,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Juſtice.

                  <p>This Iſland is famous for Cider and Perry: But its Staple Commodity is the famous <hi>Jerſey</hi> Stockings, ſo well known in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Air is mild, pleaſant, and not unwholſome. The Soil rich and fruitful. The very Hedges produce Apples and Pears, without planting; and the meaneſt Cottage can accommodate you with a Cup of Cider or Perry. Their <hi>French</hi> Wheat is equal to any in <hi>France</hi>; and their other Grain as good as any in <hi>England.</hi> The Sea yields them Plenty of Fiſh; and Wild-Fowl innumerable.</p>
                  <p>This Iſland, by a ſtrict Calculation, contains 23000 Inhabitants; and can raiſe in Defence of their Country (not including their Garriſons) upwards of 6000 Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, It is above 30 Miles round, 10 in Length, and 5 in Breadth. The Inhabitants have, to the laſt, been in the Intereſt of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and more than once the Retreat of their diſtreſt Princes. The Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> (afterwards <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi>) firſt took Shelter here, and from hence went over to <hi>Britany,</hi> where he rais'd Forces ſufficient to gain the Crown, and puniſh <hi>Richard the Third</hi> for his bloody Reign.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> II. made this Place the firſt Stage of his Exile, during <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Uſurpation. This Iſland was the laſt Place that ſurrender'd to the Parliament-Forces. Nor would the then Heroick Governor ſurrender <hi>Elizabeth's Caſtle,</hi> till he receiv'd an Order for that Purpoſe from Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> then reſiding at the <hi>French</hi> Court; and, in conſideration of their many Services, and unſhaken Loyalty, it has had many Privileges and Immunities granted by the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; among the reſt, a Silver Mace, ſent 'em by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. in the Year 1663.</p>
                  <p>Thro' their watchful Courage, they have often repuls'd the <hi>French,</hi> who have made many vain Attempts to graft this Scien to its ancient Stock. The greateſt Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency is, its want of Wood for Fuel; inſtead of that, they make uſe of a Sea Weed, by the Inhabitants call'd <hi>Vraù.</hi> The chief Town of the Iſland is call <hi>St. Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> But the ſtrongeſt Caſtle, perhaps, in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Dominion, is call'd <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> compleated in that Queen's Reign, built upon a Rock, in the middle of the Ocean, in the Mouth of Bay <hi>St. Aubin</hi>'s. There is no Paſſage from the Iſland on Foot, but at low Water, nor then, for above ten Men in Front. Oppoſite, near the Town of <hi>St. Aubin</hi>'s, is another ſtrong Tower, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sea, call'd <hi>La Tour,</hi> or, <hi>The Tower.</hi> The Natives, in general, ſpeak <hi>French,</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and ſeem to be a courteous, good-natur'd, affable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, never better pleas'd than when conferring Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0201000402:208"/>Inquiring for the Captain of the Ship in the Harbour, we found him at a Tavern; but I was agreeably ſurpriz'd to find it Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> and his Ship the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which he worthily ſav'd for his Couſin, Mr. <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that marry'd the Widow by a Wile. He hardly knew me at firſt; but when I came to his Remembrance, he ſeem'd as much tranſported, as if I had been his own Son. He was confounded to find me with ſuch Company, in a Place ſo little expected; but I ſoon let him into as much of my Story, as I thought proper. I muſt own, ſaid he, when I receiv'd a Letter from the Governor yeſterday, deſiring it as a Favour, to give Paſſage to <hi>England</hi> to ſome Gentlemen, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their Servants, I did not intend to comply with it, through the Inconveniency
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0201000402:209"/>
it would put me to; therefore gave Orders to ſet Sail early in the Morning, knowing there was another Veſſel now in the Harbour, that ſails for <hi>England</hi> in a few Days: Neither could the Governor take it ill, as he only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Letter to any Captain that ſhou'd chance to be in the Bay. But if I had known my Paſſengers, I wou'd have ſtaid a Fort-night, to oblige them, and myſelf too. I return'd him Thanks for his Civility, and begg'd him to ſet Sail with the ſooneſt. Why then, this Moment, if you pleaſe, anſwer'd the Captain.</p>
            <p>Upon the Inſtant, he took Leave of his Company at the Tavern, and (tho' we were all very much fatigu'd) went on Board his Ship, where he gave immediate Orders for weighing Anchor; and we were under Sail before Break of Day. The Captain reſign'd the great Cabbin to the two Ladies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated every Body as well as he cou'd.</p>
            <p>I retir'd to mine, hoping I ſhou'd meet with a little Repoſe, being ſomething calmer in my Mind, knowing a few Days wou'd put a Period to my Misfortunes, by Death; for I had made a firm Reſolution to puniſh the Perfidy of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Husband, or fall by his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0201000402:210"/>
Hand; or if I ſurviv'd, to find a way to die beneath her Feet.</p>
            <p>Theſe Thoughts lull'd me to taſte the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of refreſhing Sleep. But my Senſes were hardly lock'd up, before I was awak'd with the Groans of a Perſon, not far off, in one of the Cabbins. I aroſe up in my Bed, and liſten'd; when I heard a Man cry, For Heaven's ſake! take off my Irons, that I may die at Liberty! Another anſwer'd, You know I dare not do it, without the Captain's Order, and he is now gone to ſleep; as ſoon as he is up, I'll go and acquaint him. Dear <hi>Tom,</hi> reply'd the other, take Pity on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries I feel, and ſtep to him now; I know he does not want Humanity, or Good-nature; and tho' I deſerve not the leaſt Favour from him, yet, when I am going to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to Heaven for all my Crimes, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd he will releaſe me from theſe heavy Irons, that even a Man in Health can hardly bear.</p>
            <p>I own, I was touch'd with the Perſon's deep Sighs, therefore call'd for my Servant, put on my Gown, and went to enquire into the melancholy Affair. When I came to the Cabbin where the Wretch lay, I was ſhock'd
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0201000402:211"/>
to ſee a Man ſtretch'd at his Length, upon a poor Flock-Bed on the Ground, without any Covering, meagre and pale, with at leaſt a hundred Pounds Weight of Irons about his Body; to me, he ſeem'd as if his laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were approaching. Compaſſion took Poſſeſſion of my Soul, tho' I was convinc'd, by his own Diſcourſe, he deſerv'd but little.</p>
            <p>A Sailor that was walking upon Deck, came up to me, and judging, by my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that I ſeem'd to pity the unfortunate Wretch, cry'd out, What, is he going? let him go, and be d—n'd! Friend (ſaid I) let this poor Creature's Crimes be what they will, I muſt own, I think his Condition deſerves Compaſſion; therefore, I ſhall be very much oblig'd to you, if you will free him from his Irons, that his Soul may take its Flight with the more Tranquillity. Sir (reply'd the Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor) if you were acquainted with that Rogue's wicked Heart, you would believe no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this, or the next World, could be bad enough for him. O Sir! cry'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Wretch, I deſerve every thing that Man ſays; but I have heartily repented of all the ill Actions I have committed, and only beg to die without this Load upon my Body. Some of theſe Irons have eat my Fleſh from
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0201000402:212"/>
the Bones; and, as I wear the Form of a Man, don't let me be treated in my Dying Moments, worſe than a mad Beaſt ty'd to the Stake.</p>
            <p>I us'd ſo many Perſuaſions, with the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick of a Guinea, to the Perſon that ſeem'd to have the Guard of him, that he was going to awake the Captain, and acquaint him with the poor Wretch's Condition, and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to have him releas'd from his Fetters; but the Captain that Moment came out of his Cabbin, being diſturb'd with our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, at my Intreaty, order'd his Irons to be taken off. As ſoon as he was freed from them, he gave me Thanks for the Service I had done him, and riſing ſlowly from his Bed whereon he lay, ſeiz'd upon ſome of the Irons he was releas'd from, and ſtruck the Sailor (that was talking to me before the Captain came out of his Cabbin) with ſuch Violence, that we all believ'd he was kill'd; then made a Blow at the Captain, which he happily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, by ſtarting aſide; but perceiving the Sailors running from all Parts of the Ship to ſeize him, he threw himſelf overboard mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all they could do to prevent him, crying, he had in ſome meaſure ſatisfy'd his Revenge, and was never ſeen more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:0201000402:213"/>All this was done ſo ſuddenly, that I ſtood quite confounded, imagining I was in a Dream. But when we began to recollect ourſelves, we went to ſee if the Sailor was alive or dead. We took him up, and I muſt own, I was very well pleas'd to find he was only ſtunn'd with the Blow. In a little time he came to his Senſes; and the firſt Words he ſpoke were, G—d D—n him, for a Son of a B—h! who wou'd have thought he had ſo much Strength left? But I'll prevent him giving another Blow! Upon ſaying this, he ran up and down the Deck, with his Cutlaſs drawn (he being one of the Centries at the great Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin Door) to ſeek for him, to make an end of him, but when he was inform'd of his raſh Cataſtrophe, he ſeem'd to be uneaſy that he had not the killing of him with his own Hand.</p>
            <p>By this time, my Brother, <hi>Clerimont,</hi> and the Ladies, were alarm'd, and came about us, to know the Cauſe of the Diſturbance. I told 'em, 'twas the firſt time I ever found Compaſſion a dangerous Virtue. We begg'd of the Captain to let us into the Affair. He told us, at Dinner it ſhou'd be our Deſert, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Fruit. While this Combuſtion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, the Man at the Helm had diſregarded
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0201000402:214"/>
the Steerage, ſo that the Sails clap'd to the Maſts, and the Ship ſtaid ſome time; but even this ſeem'd the Providence of Heaven, for, had we continu'd our Courſe, it being a very hazy Morning, we ſhou'd have run upon the Shallows of the <hi>Great Sark</hi>

            <p>When the Ship had her true Way again, the Captain order'd the Wretches Bedding and Cloaths to be examin'd, and thrown over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board: In ſearching the Pockets of an old pair of Breeches, they found a written Paper, with a Pencil, which he read to the Company, as follows:
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>IF Heaven forſakes me, Hell will receive me with open Arms. I have endeavour'd to repent, but ſtill find my Mind bent on Revenge, and I will hazard my Body and Soul to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it.

I write this to leave behind, that if I ſhould die in my Confinement, thoſe Villains may know what I intended to do.

            <p>This terrible Declaration, made me very much repent my Good-nature. I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think there had been ſuch a wicked Villain in the World.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, we begg'd Captain <hi>Brooks</hi> to relate the Hiſtory of this Wretch; which he did in the following manner:</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid he (directing his Diſcourſe to me, having ſome ſmall Knowledge of him) you know my Couſin <hi>Bridgford,</hi> the old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of your good Uncle, made me Captain of the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in conſideration of ſome
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0201000402:216"/>
Services he was pleas'd to own I did him. This Wretch, who is gone to the other World, to anſwer for his Crimes in this, through my Intreaty, was made chief Mate; and behav'd honeſtly as ſuch, during our Trading-Voyage to the <hi>Indies.</hi> In our Return, near the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>St. Helena,</hi> where we were bound for ſome Refreſhment, in the middle of a dark Night, we heard ſome Guns fir'd, that ſeem'd to us as if ſome Veſſel was in Diſtreſs; I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd our Ship to ſteer the Courſe from whence the Fire came; but in an Hour afterwards, we heard ſuch a terrible Report, that we all concluded the unfortunate Veſſel was blown into the Air. However, I kept on my Courſe, to ſee if I cou'd aſſiſt any of the unfortunate Wretches, that (no doubt) had either got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Boat, or had thrown themſelves into the Water, to avoid the Flames, hanging out Lights about ſeveral Parts of my Ship, that they might ſee where to come for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
            <p>In leſs than an Hour more, ſome of our Crew cou'd perceive a Boat rowing towards us, full of Men. As ſoon as they came up with us, they begg'd for Heaven's ſake, to be taken on Board. I, who had no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, mov'd by Compaſſion, conſidering
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0201000402:217"/>
it might have been our own Caſe, invited 'em kindly on Board. When they were a little recover'd from their Fright, they inform'd me, they belong'd to a Ship bound for <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and had, by a violent Storm, been drove out of their Courſe; that in the beginning of the Night, a Fire broke out in the Gun-Room, burning with ſuch Fury, that all their Endeavours to extinguiſh it prov'd fruitleſs; therefore they hoiſted out their Long-Boat, and with one Barrel of Water, and two Casks of Bisket, abandon'd their Ship; and in half an Hour after they left it, they ſaw it blow up, ſeveral Pieces of the Veſſel falling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty Yards of 'em.</p>
            <p>There were ſeventeen Men in the Boat, their Maſter being one of them, whoſe Name was <hi>Cox</hi>; but obſerving he was very much wounded in the Head, I order'd our Surgeon to dreſs him immediately, who inform'd me his Skull was fractur'd, and he thought it ſeem'd to be a Blow with a Cutlaſs: But the Sailors that came with him in the Boat, told us he aroſe up haſtily, at the firſt Noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Fire, and hurrying down the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that goes under Deck, fell with his Head on the Edge of a Bucket. When he came
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0201000402:218"/>
to his Senſes (for the Pain of Dreſſing had flung him into a Swoon) he told us the ſame Story. Yet ſtill, the Surgeon inſiſted it cou'd be no ſuch thing, and began to inſtil, I know not what Notions, into my Mind, that theſe Men might be Villains. I own, he a little ſtagger'd my Faith at firſt; but when I conſider'd their Condition, I thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. However, I determin'd to leave 'em all at <hi>St. Helena,</hi> becauſe, indeed, there were too many Mouths for me to maintain in our Voyage for <hi>England.</hi> I gave 'em all the Refreſhment my Ship cou'd afford, and they return'd me Thanks in ſo ſincere a manner, that quite obliterated thoſe Notions the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon had of them. The Captain I put in my own Cabbin, uſing him, as I thought an honeſt unfortunate Man, in his Condition, deſerv'd, and ſuch as I ſhould have been pleas'd to meet with, upon the like unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Accident.</p>
            <p>In two Days after this, we arriv'd ſafe at <hi>St. Helena</hi>

It is very well inhabited, but they dwell in the Vallies; except when the Ships arrive, when they repair to the Fort with their Proviſions for the Ships, every Trader having a Warehouſe in the Town, where they barter with the Sailors for Neceſſaries, ſeldom any Money paſſing between them. When the Ships are gone, the Planters retire to their Houſes in the Vallies, that are delightfully ſituated, breathing a healthful Air, and ſubjected to few Diſeaſes. They are govern'd by the ſame Laws as in <hi>England.</hi>

Sailors on Shore, with this Reaſon, that my Ship was too deep laden to be incumber'd with ſo many ſuperfluous Men.</p>
            <p>I went to wait on the Governor on Shore, and contracted with him for what freſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions I wanted, intending to ſet Sail in eight Days; but the Governor advis'd me to ſtay longer, aſſuring me, that ſeveral Ships would arrive before that Time, that would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me in our Voyage home.

Fortnight, to enjoy the Air of the Country. But my Surgeon being inform'd of my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, came with my Servant in the Boat, with the Things I had ſent for, importuning me ſo ſtrongly not to lie out of the Ship, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I return'd on Board with him, purely to make him eaſy; for, I muſt own, his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did not give me the leaſt Inquietude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homes</hi> (the Name of the Wretch that is ſo lately gone to Perdition) complain'd he was very much troubled with the Scurvy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intreated the Favour of going on Shore for a few Days. I cou'd not refuſe him; neither had I any Apprehenſion of an ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign from him, having ever behav'd in the Voyage, like a downright honeſt Man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in our Owner's Intereſt. We ſtaid twenty Days in the Harbour, without the Appearance of any Ship from the Eaſt, therefore I made a Reſolution of purſuing our intended Voyage, if no Veſſel arriv'd to bear us company, in four Days: Accordingly, I gave Notice to the Governor of my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as uſual, that the Inhabitants, if they had any Demands, might be ſatisfy'd before we ſet Sail.</p>
            <p>I went to reſt that Night with a Tremor upon my Spirits, and an unaccountable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0201000402:221"/>
that ſeem'd a foreboding ill Omen. About Midnight, the Surgeon came into my Cabbin, and awak'd me, with a very great Surprize in his Countenance. His Looks, I own, very much alarm'd me. What's the matter with you, Mr. <hi>Weſtwood?</hi> ſaid I (that's the Name of my Surgeon) you ſeem in ſome Diſorder! Sir (reply'd Mr. <hi>Weſtwood</hi>) here's a Man has ſwam from Shore, in the middle of a ſtormy Night, to give you Notice of approaching Danger; and, I muſt own, I have been in ſuch a continual Lowneſs of Spirits, that I am well aſſur'd ſome ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are hatching againſt our Welfare; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray riſe, and hear what the Perſon has to ſay, for he will not communicate it to any one but yourſelf. I aroſe upon the Inſtant, and deſired him to bring in the Man. He brought him into the Cabbin, naked as he was. As ſoon as I ſaw him, I knew him for one of the Perſons that came to us in the Boat. Sir, ſaid he, I have ſomething to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of, that requires your private Ear. My Friend (I reply'd) this Gentleman is one whom I can entirely truſt, therefore what you have to communicate to me, he may hear. If ſo, Sir, reply'd the Man, I ſhall proceed. However, Sir, ſaid I, I beg the Favour
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0201000402:222"/>
(ſince you came naked for my Service, as I ſuppoſe) that you will put on this Nightgown. Sir, return'd the Man, I'll accept of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; tho' I feel nothing of the Inclemency of the Weather, becauſe my Concern for you has fill'd up all my Thoughts: I therefore will proceed to tell you what I know, that you may be prepar'd for the Event. Mr. <hi>Homes,</hi> your chief Mate, has form'd the blackeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that cou'd ever enter into the Soul of the moſt Profligate. In leſs than two Hours, he will ſeize your Ship, and put to Death You, and Mr. <hi>Weſtwood,</hi> with every Sailor that will not come into his black Deſign. I own myſelf one of the Confederates, but with no other Motive, than to uſe my utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prevent it, if Heaven will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Therefore acquaint your Men with the Danger approaching, arm 'em immediately, and prevent 'em, if poſſible; at leaſt, ſell your Lives like Men that have deſerv'd a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fate. I was eager to enquire about this Affair; but the Man told me, I had no Time to loſe; firſt arm your Men, ſaid he, and when you are in Readineſs to receive them, I'll acquaint you with the Conſpiracy againſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0201000402:223"/>I then order'd the Watch to awake thoſe that were gone to Reſt; and when they were all upon Deck, with their Arms in their Hands, I call'd the Man, and deſired he would communicate the Story to the whole Crew, which conſiſted of Fifty-four Men. We made a Circle round him upon the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Deck, and he began as follows:</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you all know me (I believe) to be one of thoſe Men, whom the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of your Captain ſav'd from imminent Death, therefore I think he has a Right to my Life and Fortune. Every Perſon, beſide myſelf, that his Compaſſion gave Means of Life to, have deſerv'd the Halter more than once. Their Number was much greater, their Crew conſiſting of 120 Men, when they ſet out from the Coaſt of <hi>Guiney</hi>; but the Day before the Night you ſav'd us from the devouring Waves, we had a terrible Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War, in which we loſt above half our Men, <hi>Homes,</hi> the Captain, miſtaking her for an <hi>Indian</hi> Trader, that we had Advice of from the <hi>Guiney</hi> Coaſt. Our Ship taking Fire, by what Accident, I know not, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War's Men that had boarded us, and wou'd have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0201000402:224"/>
taken us, left us; fearing, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, they might ſuffer by us, if we blew up; and ſail'd away: The Fire was ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that we had but a ſmall time to hoiſt out our Long-boat. The Captain, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of us got into it; but many other of the Wretches endeavouring to get in, were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murder'd by the other Sailors. We row'd as faſt as we cou'd from the burning Ship; but the Cries of the Wretches we left behind, methinks, are ſtill in my Ears. It was no ſmall Joy to us, when we perceiv'd your Lights hung out. But the Wretch, the Captain, tho' ſo dangerouſly wounded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, if he thought he ſhou'd have met with a Ship ſo ſoon, he wou'd have taken all the Men he cou'd, that he might have been able to have taken the Ship that was coming to his Reſcue. But ſince it is as it is, ſaid he, we muſt make the beſt of a bad Market, and wait for ſome Opportunity to get another Ship. Then we conſulted how to impoſe on you with a falſe Story, and trump'd up That they told you; for the Wound the Captain has upon his Head, was given by a <hi>Dutchman</hi> in the Fight. Pray, ſaid the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, how came you among ſuch a Crew of Villains? Why, Sir, I'll tell you, reply'd
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0201000402:225"/>
the Man; I belong'd to a Coaſt Sloop in the River of <hi>Gambo,</hi> where all my Crew were murder'd, but one, by the Negroes, who had inviegled them up into the Country. The poor Man that made his Eſcape, had but juſt time to tell me the fatal News, ere Death overtook him, from the Wounds he had receiv'd. I had ſcarce time to cut my Cable, and drive out to Sea, favour'd by the Wind and Tide of Ebb, when I perceiv'd about twenty Boats coming down the River, in order to ſeize my Sloop, and, no doubt, to make me partake of the ſame Fate with my unfortunate Men; which I certainly ſhould have done, for they would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken me in a couple of Hours, if both they and I had not perceiv'd a Ship in the <hi>Offin,</hi> which prov'd to be this Wretch and his Crew. I made them a Signal of my Diſtreſs, which they perceiving, made up to me, and took me on Board; but the Negroes left their Purſuit, as ſoon as ever they diſcover'd the Ship.</p>
            <p>I ſoon found, to my Sorrow, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I was got into; but it was to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to complain, for the Captain ſeiz'd my Veſſel, took out every thing that ſeem'd uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſunk her, with this Pretence, He
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0201000402:226"/>
fear'd his Men might take it into their Heads to leave him, and ſet up for themſelves; tho', I muſt own, he promis'd to pay me for my Cargo, and give me my Liberty the firſt Opportunity; but thoſe were but Words, and what I verily believe he never intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>I often obſerv'd your Mate, during the time we were ſailing to this Iſland (after you kindly took us in) caballing privately with our Captain, and ſeveral of our Men; but had no Notion of their wicked Intention to ſeize your Ship, till Yeſterday Morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a Planter's in the <hi>South Valley,</hi> where I was treated with ſome Palm Wine, and not being us'd to drink in a Morning, it got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Head; finding myſelf inclin'd to ſleep, I laid myſelf down under a Hedge, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had clos'd my Eyes, I was interrupted by the Voices of our Captain, and your Mate. By their Diſcourſe, I found out their black Deſign; and their Buſineſs to that Plantation was, to communicate the Affair to me; but I underſtood, if I did not come into it, it was their Intention to murder me. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately aroſe from the Place, full of unquiet Thoughts, which brought me out of my drunken Fit. I took care to get as far from
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0201000402:227"/>
the Hedge as I cou'd, that they might not ſuſpect I had overheard 'em. It was a full Quarter of an Hour before they found me out, and in that time I had compos'd my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as I cou'd. When they came up with me, they ask'd me, if I wou'd take a Walk to the next Plantation, where two of them lodg'd. I anſwer'd, very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Yes.</p>
            <p>When we came to the Bridge that was built over the River, they ſtop'd, and open'd the whole Affair to me. I made no Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but enter'd into their Deſign with a ſeeming Joy; for if I had not, I don't doubt but it was their Intention to throw me into the River. Nay, their very Looks declar'd as much.</p>
            <p>At Three o' Clock this Morning, your Mate, with the reſt, are to board you, arm'd every Man with a Cutlaſs, and two Brace of Piſtols, ſecure the Watch, and kill every one that will not take part in their villainous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; then weigh Anchor, and ſail for the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> where they will diſpoſe of the Cargo, and then ſet out upon the Pirating account.</p>
            <p>When he had finiſh'd his ſhort, but terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relation, the Sailors cry'd out, they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0201000402:228"/>
wou'd have the Long-boat, and meet them with ſuch a Reception, that ſhou'd make 'em repent their Undertaking: But the Surgeon and I perſuaded them, it would be better, and ſafer, to counterwork them. We therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to charge all our Guns with Musket-Ball, and if they offer'd to come on, when we order'd them to return, the Sailors ſhou'd fire upon 'em. However, eight of my Men prevail'd upon me to have the Long-boat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to purſue them, and bring 'em Priſoners, in order to be puniſh'd for their treacherous Intention.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we provided againſt every thing, and in half an Hour after we were prepar'd to receive 'em, we heard their Oars in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We let 'em come within three Ships Length of us, and then call'd to 'em to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther. As they (I believe) did not expect to be hinder'd in their Boarding us, they lay upon their Oars, and ask'd me what I was afraid of. <hi>Homes</hi> was the chief Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who I ſoon gave to underſtand, I knew his vile Intention. If it be ſo (he cry'd out) we have no Time to dally. Come, my Lads, we'll ſoon ſee who are to be Maſters, they, or we. Upon that, they row'd towards us with all their Strength, with their Cutlaſſes drawn,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0201000402:229"/>
and Piſtols in their Hands. But before they reach'd us, we fir'd upon 'em with our Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Round, which kill'd four of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wounded ſeveral. Their Confuſion was ſo great, at this unexpected Reception, that they row'd a-head of us, where our Guns cou'd not bear upon them. While I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my Men upon the Forecaſtle to fire upon them, I perceiv'd the Ship driving, for that Wretch, <hi>Homes,</hi> had cut my Cable.</p>
            <p>The Tide, by good Fortune, was ebbing; for had it been Tide of Flood, we muſt have drove upon the Rocks, before we cou'd have caſt another Anchor. In the Confuſion, the Boat row'd to board us; but my Men fir'd upon them once more, in the ſame manner as at firſt, which put 'em in much Diſorder. Our Ship ſtill driving, I order'd 'em to caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. However, they took ſo much Time in doing it, that we were a Quarter of a League from the Pirates, before the Anchor fell. In the mean time, our Long-boat, with the eight Men, got up to the Pirates, and a deſperate Engagement follow'd. What trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me was, that I cou'd not aſſiſt 'em, for if I had fir'd my Guns with Ball, which cou'd eaſily reach 'em, I might have deſtroy'd my Friends with my Enemies. My Men
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0201000402:230"/>
were ſwearing, curſing, and banning at this unforeſeen Accident; nay, ſome of 'em were for ſtripping, with an Intention to ſwim na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to help 'em, never once conſidering the Tide of Ebb wou'd prevent 'em. But what was the more extraordinary in this Confuſion, not one of us, for ſome time, thought of our Yawl upon the Booms. But as ſoon as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd it, they got it into the Water in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, threw themſelves into it with ſo much Precipitation, that their Haſte had almoſt overſet it, and row'd away with ſo much Strength, that they ſoon got up to the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Comrades in good time, for two of 'em were kill'd, and the other ſix very much wounded. Their Firing (we obſerv'd) had ceas'd ſome time, having diſcharg'd all their Fire-Arms; and if the Yawl had not arriv'd as it did, the other ſix of my Men had certainly been cut to pieces; but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement ſoon put an end to the Fight, by the Death of all the Pirates but two, and <hi>Homes,</hi> who were very much wounded.</p>
            <p>When they were brought on Board, my Men were for tearing them to pieces, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Homes</hi>; but I pacify'd them a little, by telling 'em they ſhou'd be reſerv'd for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to their Crimes, when we arriv'd in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0201000402:231"/>My Surgeon dreſs'd their Wounds, and, by good Fortune, all my own Men recover'd; but the two Pirates dy'd in our Voyage home. The vile Wretch, <hi>Homes,</hi> while his Hurts were healing, us'd to utter ſuch blaſphemous Imprecations, that ſhock'd all the Crew. When he was fully recover'd, I order'd him to be manacled, leaving his Legs at Liberty, with two Men to guard him. He often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to throw himſelf overboard, and was as often prevented.</p>
            <p>About a Month ago, as he was walking upon Deck, with his two Guards, he obſerv'd Mr. <hi>Mullart,</hi> (the Perſon that ſwam on Board to give us Notice of their Deſign) ſtanding upon the Gunnel of the Ship, to look at a dead Whale that was floating near us. He goes up to him, unobſerv'd, and puſh'd him into the Sea. As it fell out, the Sea was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calm, tho' we had Wind enough to fill our Sails; otherwiſe, tho' a good Swimmer, he might have periſh'd. We brought to, with all the Celerity imaginable, and not without ſome Difficulty, ſav'd him.</p>
            <p>One of the Sailors upbraiding him for the Cruelty of the Action, he ſtruck him in the Face, broke his Jaw, and beat out three of his Teeth, with his Hand-Cuffs. I ſeeing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0201000402:232"/>
this vile Proceeding, order'd him to be ſeiz'd and fetter'd; but it was with much Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for he laid about him with ſuch Agility and Vigor, that a Carpenter was oblig'd to knock him down with a Hand-Spike. When he came to himſelf (for the Blow had ſtunn'd him for ſome time) he ſwore he was ſorry for nothing, but that <hi>Mullart</hi> was not gone to Hell by Water.</p>
            <p>As I was giving Orders how he ſhou'd be us'd for the future, he grinn'd at me, gave me ſeveral hearty Curſes, and ſpit in my Face, which, I own, provok'd me to ſtrike him. He was then laid in the manner you ſaw him this Morning.</p>
            <p>About a Week ago, he began to think of his Crimes, and ſeem'd ſo penitent, that I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Irons to be taken off, had him bath'd, ſhifted, and clean'd. When his Cloaths were on again, Mr. <hi>Mullart</hi> being upon Deck, he very ſubmiſſively approach'd him, telling him, he was very ſorry for what he had done to him; but as ſoon as ever he got within his Reach, he flew upon him, got him down, and in his Fury wou'd have ſtrangled him, if if he had not been taken away by main Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0201000402:233"/>We all thought it high time to make him as ſecure as poſſible, for ſuch an infernal Wretch never more cou'd deſerve Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For theſe laſt three Days, his Centries have thought him near his Death; but it was only his Artifice, to get clear once more, that he might do more Miſchief in his laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> had ended his Story, we all thought it impoſſible Nature ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out ſuch a Villain. And yet, ſaid the Captain, this Wretch has made more than one Voyage with me, and ever ſeem'd a Man of Integrity; an open and free Countenance, that diſcover'd no Rancour or Baſeneſs in it. But, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> ſays, <hi>There's no Art to find the Mind's Conſtruction in the Face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſail'd on with a favourable Gale, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Courſe for the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Channel, where Captain <hi>Brooks</hi> was bound. On the fourth Day after our leaving <hi>Guernſey,</hi> we diſcover'd the chalky Cliffs of our Native Country, which gave a ſudden Alteration to the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of every one of the Company; all but myſelf, wore a pleaſing Contentment on their Countenances; but, for my own part, my Mind felt ſo many Viciſſitudes, that the wiſeſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0201000402:234"/>
Phyſiognomiſt, I believe, wou'd have been puzzled to have known my Thoughts; but no Wonder, for I knew 'em not myſelf. All the Paſſions of Love, Duty, Hatred, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, Revenge, and Death, mix'd in ſuch a general Tumult, that all within was wild A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and Uproar. The Thoughts of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Native Country, which fill'd every one elſe with the utmoſt Tranſports, gave me no other Satisfaction, than the Hopes of Death, to put an end to Thought, and all my devouring Sorrows.</p>
            <p>In two Days more, we came to an Anchor near the Landing-Place of the Iſland of <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Iſland of <hi>Lundy</hi> is an Iſland five Miles long, and two broad, ſurrounded with Rocks, in the middle of the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea, near the Coaſt of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> thinly inhabited; and altho' ſeated in the Salt Ocean, yet there are many Springs of excellent Freſh-Water, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly ſtock'd with Wild-Fowl.</note>, where we found a ſmall Veſſel bound for <hi>Monmouth.</hi> As that Place was but a Day's Journey from moſt of our Dwellings, we took Leave of Captain <hi>Brooks,</hi> and embark'd in that Veſſel for <hi>Monmouth.</hi> The Captain parted from us with very great Regret, but with a Promiſe to ſee us in a few Days after
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0201000402:235"/>
his Arrival at <hi>Briſtol.</hi> We weigh'd Anchor together, and kept Company, till we arriv'd at the Mouth of the <hi>Avon,</hi> that leads to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> and then parted, after receiving ſeveral Guns from the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by way of Salute. We arriv'd that Night at <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> upon the River <hi>Wye,</hi> where all the Company deſir'd to be ſet on Shore, for they were very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd, particularly the Ladies.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever we landed, I ſent one of my Servants to acquaint my Uncle with my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, and of my Intentions to wait on him in three Days, at the fartheſt; with Orders to my Servant to meet me at <hi>Monmouth</hi> the next Day, where we arriv'd by Noon. I found my Servant waiting for me, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me, that my Uncle and Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> had been gone to <hi>London</hi> four Days before, to wait my Arrival there. I own, I was both griev'd, and pleas'd; griev'd, that I ſhould not ſee my dear Uncle ſo ſoon as I expected; and pleas'd, to know that he had receiv'd my Letters, and had Strength and Health enough to travel.</p>
            <p>Now Deſpair, with all its black Train of Horrors, fully poſſeſs'd my Soul; yet gave me Light enough to ſee, I ſhou'd never poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs my dear <hi>Iſabella!</hi> All Hopes were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0201000402:236"/>
and the nearer I drew to the Reſidence of my adorable Fair One, the farther I drew from all Thoughts of Happineſs. What Pains, what Miſeries, what Anxieties, and what inexpreſſible Tortures, was my broken Heart torn with! Treading upon the ſame Earth, and breathing the ſame Air with my dear Love, for ever debarr'd my Arms, only added to my various Torments.</p>
            <p>I went to Reſt, but alas! the Fatigues of the Sea, the Weakneſs of my Body, and the want of Sleep, were over-balanc'd by the Tortures of my Mind.</p>
            <p>I aroſe in the Morning, without ever clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my Eyes, which had made ſuch an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in my Countenance, that I was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by my Friends: They were too well acquainted with the Cauſe, yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, endeavour'd to comfort me. But alas! they might as well have ſtopt the Fury of a Tempeſt, or the ſwifteſt Current in its rapid Courſe, as give Advice to heal my wounded Soul.</p>
            <p>My Friend was inconſolable, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Ruin was the Work of his unlucky forming; and maugre my ill Fate, I was compell'd to ſmother my Heart-breaking Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, in order to comfort him, who now
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0201000402:237"/>
was dearer to me than any thing on Earth, ſince I had loſt all Hopes of my Divine <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tortures of my Mind prey'd ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently on my Body, that I was once more hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to the dark Confines of Death. A ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Meſſenger was ſent to my Uncle at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to inform him of my unhappy State, and my new-converted dear Friend wou'd accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him, maugre all my Intreaties to the contrary. I was ſo very weak, it was danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to remove me to my Uncle's, tho' but a ſhort Day's Journey from <hi>Monmouth.</hi> As I thought my laſt Moments approaching, I took a Reſolution of writing the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Iſabella.</hi>

Oh, how happy ſhou'd I have been, if I had never imbark'd from my Native Country! But 'tis Heaven's high Will it ſhou'd be ſo; and I wiſh I cou'd not complain; it wou'd have been too great a Happineſs, to have been bleſs'd with thee.

            <p>My Spirits, with my Tears and Sighs, had left me, and it was ſome time ere I had Strength enough to fold the Letter, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it <hi>To the Divine</hi> Iſabella.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0201000402:239"/>I order'd my Servant that had accompany'd me in my Travels, to find her out, and if it was poſſible, to give it into her own Hands. Obſerve (ſaid I) her Countenance; tell her the unhappy Condition of thy Maſter. I will, if it be poſſible, keep Life till thy Return, that I may have the Pleaſure in Dying, to hear ſhe has dropt a Tear for all my Misfortunes. He promis'd to execute his Commiſſion with the utmoſt Diligence.</p>
            <p>The next Day he return'd, with a dejected Countenance, and inform'd me that <hi>Iſabella,</hi> her Mother, and Aunt, had been gone ſome Days from their Houſe, but none of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cou'd inform him whither. He alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of the Neighbourhood, but to as little Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This ſtruck me into the laſt Depth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, inſomuch, that I reſolv'd to put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to my Life. I refus'd all Phyſic, Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and Reſt, and deſpis'd the Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Brother and his Friends. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd 'em, no one upon Earth, not my dear Uncle, ſhou'd deſtroy my Reſolution of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he arriv'd before I expir'd. They preſs'd me with their Tears and Sighs, but all in vain: Till at laſt, they prevail'd upon me to hear the Prayers of a worthy Clergyman,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0201000402:240"/>
who ſo effectually cur'd me of Deſpair, by laying before me the never-forgiven Sin of Self-Murder, that I ſubmitted to all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. The Phyſicians preſcrib'd, I took their Medicines, receiv'd what they intended for Nouriſhment, and addreſs'd myſelf to Sleep; yet all to no purpoſe. Death glar'd me full in the Face, tho' all his Terrors cou'd not fright me. I look'd upon him as the only Cure for a broken Heart. The Converſation with my good Prieſt, had, I thank Heaven, ſettled my Conſcience. I expected Death's Approach, as that of my beſt Friend, and hop'd to ſee him before my Uncle, that I might not be a living Witneſs to all his Heart-rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Griefs. They gave me Medicines to make me ſleep; but, alas! the Agonies I felt, in what the Apothecaries call <hi>Compoſing Draughts,</hi> and that ſeem to lock up the Senſes to ſoft Slumber, are hardly to be expreſs'd. The Mind was ſtill awake, tho' my Body ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was at reſt; and Fancy repreſented to me my hard Fortune, with redoubled Terrors.</p>
            <p>I was ten Days in this languiſhing deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition, fluctuating between Death and Life, when News was brought me of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's Arrival. Tho' I wiſh'd to ſink to the ſilent Grave, for the Reaſon I juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0201000402:241"/>
yet my Heart felt ſome Gleam of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he was come to cloſe my Eyes, and bleſs me ere I died. When my Uncle enter'd the Room where I lay, he ran to me, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrac'd me, and wept over me. O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaid he, is this the Joy I propos'd to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in thy precious Converſation? No, my dear Boy, thou ſhalt not leave me. Forget <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and turn thy Eyes to another Beauty I have brought with me, that loves thee for thy Virtue and thy Merit; and, if that can have any effect upon thee, ſhe is the very Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thy loſt <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Since ſhe is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's, turn thy Eyes upon this Lady, and let her Charms cure thoſe Wounds the other gave. Alas! Sir, ſaid I, Fate is not to be controll'd, and my Paſſion is as irrevocable. Wilt thou not live (reply'd my Uncle) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my feeble Age, who have no other Joy in Life, but thee? I have been induſtrious to provide this Match for thee; and, contrary to the Rules of the Sex, have prevail'd upon her to accompany me. Do not let thy hopeleſs Paſſion make thee forget good Manners. Thy Slights will break her Heart. Never poor Wretch had ſuch a Conflict in his Soul. I thought it wou'd be the higheſt Ingratitude, not to ſee a poor young Lady, that had given
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0201000402:242"/>
me her Heart, without ſeeing me. After much Argument, I told my Uncle, if he pleas'd, he might bring the Lady to ſee what a Wretch ſhe had plac'd her unhappy Love upon, and all the Satisfaction I cou'd give her was, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire before her; for I told my Uncle, I found Death approaching.</p>
            <p>He immediately went out, and return'd with my Friend, who led a Lady by the Hand. I then call'd to mind (weak as I was) he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told me of a beautiful Siſter of his, that he wiſh'd I cou'd love, that he might make me ſome Recompence for the Loſs he caus'd of my <hi>Iſabella.</hi> And I, out of good Manners, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaid any thing againſt it.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid I, your good Brother has brought you to ſee a Wretch, tho' young, old in Misfortunes; one who is flying to the Grave, to ſeek a Refuge from 'em; one, who — What! interrupted the Lady, and has my dear <hi>Vaughan,</hi> in reality, forgot his <hi>Iſabella?</hi> The Chamber having but little Light in it, I could not diſtinguiſh the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my <hi>Iſabella</hi>; but I knew, full well, that ſoft Voice, whoſe Tone was ever in my Ears. It had ſuch an Effect upon me, that I cou'd only pronounce her dear Name, then ſunk down ſpeechleſs in my Bed. It was a full
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0201000402:243"/>
half Hour, ere they cou'd reſtore me to Senſe. But when I ſaw the dear Image tenderly weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over me, that I ever carry'd in my Heart, I cou'd not help crying out, Am I awake, or do I dream of ſuch imaginary Bliſs? Art thou indeed my <hi>Iſabella?</hi> Mine! really mine! and not wedded to that Wretch, who wou'd rob me of all my Soul can love in this World! I am thine (reply'd the charming <hi>Iſabella</hi>) ever will be thine, nor ever was, or ever will be any others'. I have my Mother's, my Aunt's and thy good Uncle's Conſent, to join our Hands, as well as Hearts together; and they are here to ratify what I ſay. Upon this, the Mother and Aunt enter'd, who tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd me, calling me their dear Son, and Nephew.</p>
            <p>Theſe tender Tranſports were too ſtrong for my weak Frame, and Joy was near doing what my Griefs wou'd ſoon have done. My Speech forſook me, and every one about me thought I was gone for ever. It was many Hours before I was brought to Life; and when I recover'd, I found my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame Condition. But kind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is watchful over thoſe that tread in the Paths of Goodneſs, in a few Days, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd us to taſte the Bliſs of happy, virtuous
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0201000402:244"/>
Love in our chaſte Converſation. It was ſome time before I had Leiſure to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my unbounded Joy; when my Friend inform'd me of it in this manner.</p>
            <p>When I ſaw you, my dear <hi>Vaughan,</hi> plung'd in Sorrow by my means, I had often Thoughts of putting an end to my wretched Life. But reflecting it wou'd be a nobler piece of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh the Villain that was the Cauſe of all our Misfortunes, I was reſolv'd to ſeek him out, to take away his Life; or give up mine, to pay for the Injuſtice I had done you thro' his Wiles. I found a fitting Pretence to leave you, when you ſuppos'd I was going with your Servant to <hi>London,</hi> in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your good Uncle with our miſerable State. But I parted with the Meſſenger the Morning we ſet out, giving him Directions to call upon me in his Return with your Uncle, to receive Advice from me, if Fate had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd I ſhou'd not fall in the Attempt; or, if they heard no News of me, to conclude I was no longer in this World. When I came within a few Miles of the Reſidence of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> a violent Storm aroſe, which made me take Shelter in a neighbouring Village. But gueſs my Surprize, when I ſaw a Coach and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0201000402:245"/>
Six ſtop at the Church Door, which, by the Liveries, I knew belong'd to that vile Man, Sir <hi>Euſtace,</hi> I formerly call'd Friend. The Sight, at firſt, almoſt took away my Senſes; but recollecting my ſcatter'd Reaſon, I ſet my ſelf to obſerve all Paſſages. The Wretch came out, dreſs'd like a foppiſh Bridegroom, leading the lovely <hi>Iſabella,</hi> trembling, pale, and wan, follow'd by the Mother and Aunt. I enquir'd of a Stander-by, if he knew that Gentleman and the Ladies? He anſwer'd, No; but that they came to be marry'd at their Town for more Privacy. Hope then began to revive in my Soul; for I was reſolv'd to put a Stop to the Wedding, or loſe my Life.</p>
            <p>I follow'd 'em into the Church, where, as ſoon as Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> ſaw me, he cry'd out, in a Tranſport of Joy, Fortune, I thank thee! thou haſt ſent the only Friend I have in the World, to be Witneſs of my Joy. Upon that, he come forward with open Arms to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me. Hold, ſaid I, puſhing him from me, I abhor all Friendſhip with a Villain; and kind Heaven has ſent me at this happy Moment, to prevent thy impoſing upon this betray'd young Lady, and her Relations, thro' thy Villainy. and my miſtaken Folly:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0201000402:246"/>
But know, the Hand of Heaven, by me, ſhall puniſh thee for all thy Villainies. He ſtood like one aghaſt; while I had time to go up to the young Lady: Madam, ſaid I, if you ever did love the unhappy <hi>Vaughan,</hi> love him ſtill, for he is innocent, and ever was ſo, but betray'd by that Wretch, who is more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Vice than Title.</p>
            <p>The lovely <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I thought, ſeem'd to liſten with an eager Tranſport in her Eyes, at what I declar'd. I gave her my Hand, and led her out of the Church, follow'd by the Parſon, who ſeem'd in the utmoſt Amazement at this wonderful Proceeding! But I told him his Diſappointment ſhou'd be no Loſs to him, for I wou'd pay him as well, as if he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the Marriage. For Heaven's ſake! Sir, reply'd the Parſon, don't imagine I am ſuch a mercenary Wretch, to think of the Loſs of what I might expect, for doing the holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I am ordain'd to by Heaven, and my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors? No, I am, I own, very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at ſuch an Adventure, that never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to me before, or any one of my holy Function, that I ever heard of. Yet I am convinc'd there is ſomething very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in your Proceeding; and I own, I think by your Appearance, and the Confuſion of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0201000402:247"/>
the other Gentleman, you are in the Right. I took a Diſtaſte againſt him the firſt time I ſaw him, when he came to me about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. What a brave Trade you would have, Doctor (ſaid he) if you cou'd grant a Licence to undo, what you have done this way, in your Time! Ah, how happy ſhould we young Fellows think ourſelves, if ſuch a Thing cou'd be brought about! But when I repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him for his ludicrous manner of ſpeaking, he cry'd, Pr'ythee, old <hi>Tackum,</hi> don't be ſo muſty; I warrant you have had many a Wench in your Time. I own, I was ſo very much offended with his ridiculous Jeſts, that I told him, the Lady he was going to marry, I fear'd, wou'd have but an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Time with him, and if I had the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of her Acquaintance, I ſhou'd think it my Duty to inform her of the Poorneſs of his Imaginations. When he found I was a little ſcandaliz'd with his mean Notions of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, he began to excuſe himſelf, and beg my Pardon.</p>
            <p>I forgot to tell you, as I led <hi>Iſabella</hi> out of the Church, my falſe Friend ſtood like one thunderſtruck in his Amazement. Villain! ſaid I, as I paſs'd him, if thou think'ſt I have injur'd thee, in the Diſcovery I ſhall make to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0201000402:248"/>
this Lady and her Relations, thou know'ſt where I may be found in a few Days, where I will be ready to chaſtiſe thy Perſidy to this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Infamy thou haſt thrown on me. He gave me no manner of Anſwer, but let me paſs on without Interruption.</p>
            <p>When we came to the Parſon's Houſe, I related (not without bluſhing) the baſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Contrivance between Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> and me, my Repentance, and the terrible Effects it had on you; alſo the Hiſtory of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the fair <hi>Fatima,</hi> with <hi>Clerimont</hi> and his Lady, as I had learnt 'em from your own Relations. The charming <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhed a Torrent of Tears at the Repetition of all your Sufferings: It was eaſily ſeen, ſhe lov'd you with an unbounded Paſſion. The Mother and Aunt ſeem'd as much tranſported with Joy, as the fair <hi>Iſabella.</hi> How ſhall I puniſh myſelf, (cry'd the Fair One) for ſo eaſily believing my dear <hi>Vaughan</hi> falſe! His good Uncle too, what ſhall we ſay to him to excuſe our ill Treatment. I comforted 'em, by telling 'em, the Proofs were too artful and plain to be doubted for Truths. In ſhort, never were any Perſons elevated from diſmal Sorrow, to the extremeſt Pitch of Pleaſure, as theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and myſelf were rais'd to. But that Joy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0201000402:249"/>
was temper'd with Fears, when I inform'd 'em of your cruel Indiſpoſition and Sorrows. We reſolv'd to ſet out as ſoon as poſſible to the Place appointed, to meet your Uncle; and if we found him not there, immediately to repair to <hi>Monmouth</hi>; but upon Enquiry, we cou'd get no Coach to carry the Ladies; therefore a Servant was order'd to <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Mother's for hers.</p>
            <p>While we were mingling our Tears, Hopes, Sorrows, and Joys, together, the Clark came to inform me, the Gentleman beg'd the Favour of ſpeaking one Word with me in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. I did not doubt, but he had muſter'd up Courage enough to call for Satisfaction for his ſuppos'd Injury. I therefore took my Sword, and maugre the Intreaties of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> her Mother, and Aunt, went to meet him. When I came near enough to him to be heard, I told him I was ready to repair the Injuries I had done him, with my Sword, if he had Spirit enough to require it. No, Sir, ſaid he, I have had time enough to recollect myſelf, and find I have been to blame in my Conduct; but notwithſtanding, I find Love, like Fate, is not to be controll'd; therefore I conjure you, by our former Friendſhip, to forget what is paſt, and aſſiſt me honeſtly to gain the fair
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0201000402:250"/>
               <hi>Iſabella.</hi> I love her more than Life, and wou'd even part with it to gain her Heart, and your Forgiveneſs, Hearing him talk ſo reaſonably, I began to loſe ſome part of my Reſentment, but yet laid before him the Impoſſibility of his ever gaining his Deſires. We argued ſome time, and our Diſcourſe had inſenſibly led us out of the Churchyard, along a narrow Lane that led to a Gate in the Fields, which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, was for turning back. Hold (ſaid he) you are not to return ſo ſoon as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Upon ſaying this, he whiſtled thro' his Fingers, and I was upon the Inſtant ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by ſix of his Footmen, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diateiy ſeiz'd and bound me. Now take that Hypocrite, and do as I order'd you. Know, thou Fool (cry'd he, looking me full in the Face) I have taken all the Time I had, before I ſent to thee, to think how I ſhou'd puniſh thee for thy Breach of Friendſhip, and the Loſs of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> With that, taking a Whip from one of his Servants, he gave me ſeveral ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Laſhes; then ſpitting in my Face, order'd his Footmen to tie me to the Gate, and leave me. Fury and Shame had ty'd up my Tongue, at this indignant Uſage; therefore I cou'd not utter a Word; and if the Tears had not guſh'd from my Eyes, I believe my Heart
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0201000402:251"/>
wou'd have burſt with Paſſion. My Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles to get looſe were to no purpoſe, and my Strength fail'd me with my fruitleſs Efforts. Which the Villain perceiving, repeated his Indignities. I know you will endeavour (cry'd he) to ſeek me out, in hopes to revenge this Affront; but be aſſur'd, Fool, whenever thou com'ſt in my way, expect to meet with the ſame Chaſtiſement. Upon this, he and his Fellows left me, almoſt dead with boiling Rage. It was not long, however, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd in this Condition; for <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſent the Clark after me, to obſerve our Motions, who on the other ſide of the Hedge, heard how I was us'd, but durſt not appear till the Villain was gone, for fear of taſting the ſame bitter Cup.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I was at Liberty, I ran, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a Word, got upon my Horſe, and flew after the Villain; but my Rage had ſo blinded me, I had not put the Tongue of the Buckle of the Girt, as I ſuppoſe, firm in its Place (for I got ready my Horſe myſelf, not having Patience to wait for any one) ſo that I came, with the Saddle between my Legs, upon the Ground, over the Crupper of my Horſe, tho' without any Hurt. But it was ſo late ere I cou'd catch him again, that I was
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0201000402:252"/>
well aſſur'd the Wretch had reach'd his Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, tho' thirty Mile from the Village where I had left <hi>Iſabella.</hi> However, I went on with my Purſuit, not conſidering the poor Beaſt, till he was ſo tir'd, I cou'd hardly get him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; therefore I went into a little by Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, reſolving to ſtay till the Morning. I never went to Bed, for my furious Paſſion was too violent for Reſt. My Time was ſpent in caſting about how to be reveng'd on the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Villain. At laſt I fix'd on this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: I procur'd a Diſguiſe, ombred my Face, and appear'd as a Gypſy. I got, the next Day, to the Villain's Caſtle, which is ſeated upon an Eminence that overlooks a Plain of two Miles round, and not one Houſe but his own in that Circuit. It was a good while ere I cou'd ſee any of the Family; but at laſt a little black Boy came out, with a Bow and Arrow, to ſhoot at a Mark he put up againſt a Tree; but as ſoon as he perceiv'd me, he ran back as if in a Fright. While I was looking after him, I ſaw the Villain meet him, who took him by the Hand, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd him to come towards me (firſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſpectly about him.) When he came to me, he cry'd, Here, you Gypſy, tell this black young Devil his Fortune. No, Villain,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0201000402:253"/>
I reply'd, I am come to tell thee thy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; behold this injur'd Face, diſguis'd as it is. He knew my Voice, and was for running back, but I got between him and the Houſe, drew my Sword that I had conceal'd under my Great-coat, and intercepted his Paſſage. He ſeeing no Hopes of eſcaping, drew his, and, as Deſpair makes Cowards valiant, he made ſeveral violent Thruſts at me, but to no purpoſe, for at laſt I ſent him breathleſs to the Ground, with my Sword thro' his Body. As ſoon as he fell, I flew over the Plain without being purſu'd, took off my Diſguiſe, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſome Stones in it, and ſunk it in a Pond on the Skirts of a Wood as I paſs'd along, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiv'd by any one. I got to the Alehouſe in my own Perſon, and that Night came back to <hi>Iſabella</hi> and her Relations, who ſpent the time of my Abſence in great Inquietudes. I have not let them yet into the whole Affair. Neither have I conſider'd with myſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to own the Deed or not. Purſuit, I know, has been made after the Gypſy, but no Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after me. If I ſurrender myſelf to the Law, I do not fear a Pardon, for the flagrant Uſage I receiv'd from that bad Man, will plead for me. The Clark, nay, even his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will be ſufficient Witneſſes of it. How
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0201000402:254"/>
wou'd you adviſe me to proceed, my dear <hi>Vaughan?</hi> I told him, I thought it wou'd be time enough to ward againſt it, when he was call'd upon to anſwer; but it was my Opinion, he wou'd not have any farther Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about it, ſince he was not ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>We had ſcarce ended our Diſcourſe, when a Servant came in, very much ſurpriz'd, and told us, there were ſeveral Officers of Juſtice, with a great Crowd of People with 'em, arm'd, enquiring for my Friend, crying, they had a Warrant to apprehend him for Murder. I own, I was raſh enough to adviſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing 'em. But he declar'd he wou'd ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render without Reſiſtance, and rely upon his Innocence and Provocation. While I was arguing the Affair with my Friend, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came into the Room where we were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by my Uncle, my Brother, and <hi>Clerimont.</hi> My Friend ſurrendred, without the leaſt Shew of Reſiſtance. As I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Stairs, to accompany him to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he ſtop'd me, begging it as a Favour I wou'd not go with him: Conſider, ſaid he, you have not recover'd your Strength, and I know your Friendſhip ſo well, that it will but diſorder you to ſee the Place where I am going. My Uncle join'd with him, Come,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0201000402:255"/>
come, <hi>Billy,</hi> ſaid my Uncle, the Sick muſt be us'd like Old Age; you and I will ſtay behind, and fear nothing. I have Intereſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this Country to have your Friend well us'd; and I have not the leaſt Fear he will ſuffer, for an Action no Man of Honour cou'd avoid. Think of the happy Moment that is now approaching. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> my Boy, the charming <hi>Iſabella,</hi> will be your own in a few Days. My dear Uncle, I reply'd, tho' I think every Minute an Age, till my Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Iſabella</hi> is mine; yet, I can't think of that Happineſs, while my dear Friend is in Miſery. Thy Friend (reply'd my Uncle) will be free from Trouble before the Marriage-Ceremony can be finiſh'd. There are Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to be drawn, Settlements made, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things to be in Order, before we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon that Affair. Beſides, I wou'd not come too abruptly into a Buſineſs that muſt laſt for Life. You muſt approach your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by degrees.</p>
            <p>My dear Uncle, I reply'd, the Thought of my coming Bliſs is ſo great, that was it not qualify'd by ſome Fear, I cou'd not bear my Tranſport. I have felt the Malevolence of that blind Diſpoſer, Chance, ſo often, I muſt own, I am ſtill in doubt; even when I am in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0201000402:256"/>
full Poſſeſſion of all my Joy, I ſhall tremble for fear of loſing her. Sickneſs and Death viſit the Youthful, as well as thoſe ſunk in the Vale of Life; and if that grim Tyrant, who rudely thruſts even to the Beds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, ſhou'd intrude with his Icy Dart to that of my divine <hi>Iſabella,</hi> alas! with what Terrors muſt I bear the remaining Hours of Life, ſince my Religion will not ſuffer me to put an end to it!</p>
            <p>Theſe imaginary Ills, reply'd my Uncle, wrong thy Underſtanding. Wou'd you think of Shipwrack in the Port; or refuſe refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sleep for fear of melancholy Dreams? No, no, the World of Happineſs is in thy View; the lovely Proſpect ſtands before thee, free from the Storms of Fortune.</p>
            <p>Whatever my good Uncle cou'd ſay to me on the joyful Subject, gave me but a gloomy Satisfaction. My dear Uncle did all in his Power to ſettle my Thoughts in Joy, and by degrees my Heart was ſo full of it, that my Eyes o'erflow'd with Tranſports, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd all Air and Spirits.</p>
            <p>My dear Uncle, ſaid I, be ſo good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome Paſſages of the unfortunate End of my good Father, and wicked Mother-in-law, that the Sorrow may alleviate this mighty Joy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0201000402:257"/>My Letter, reply'd my Uncle, inform'd thee of every thing concerning that never-to-be-forgotten Cataſtrophe. But ſearching that evil Woman's Cabinet, I found this Copy of a Letter ſhe ſent to <hi>Wigmore,</hi> with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, which convinces me that he was not that Penitent he pretended to be. Upon this, my Uncle took a couple of Letters out of his Pocket, and gave 'em me to read. The firſt was that of my vile Mother-in-law's, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:

                        <hi>I</hi> HAD counterfeited Repentance ſo well, for our paſt Loves, that I almoſt believ'd I cou'd forget thee: But alas! that is not in my Power. Why ſhould we not love on? Am I the only Woman in <hi>England,</hi> falſe to her Husband? The Court, and the City; ay, every Town, Village, and Hamlet, in this wealthy Iſland, have ſufficient Numbers to keep me in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>Nay, my Love is a Virtue, if Conſtancy's a Virtue; for I can love none but thee. You ever reign triumphant in my Heart, and ever ſhall. What are theſe Bonds of Matrimony, that tie two People together againſt their Inclination, but the imaginary Line that croſſes the Globe! 'Tis

true, we are coupled together by Law, like two Hounds in a Slip, often tugging different ways; but their Joys are unbounded when thoſe Couples are unbuckled that keep 'em together. But what Law does Love obey?</p>
                     <p>I have read ſomewhere, it is a Law, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom ſtronger than a Law, even in many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at this Day, That when a Man, even a Stranger, comes to ſtay all Night in a Place, the good-natur'd Husband civilly abandons his Houſe for that Night, leaving his new Gueſt in full Poſſeſſion of his Houſe and Wife, as the greateſt Compliment he can pay him. Oh! if that Cuſtom was but in uſe here, I ſhou'd wiſh my Husband abroad for ever, and my dear <hi>Wigmore,</hi> my amiable Traveller, every Night in the Year in my Arms.</p>

However, I have ſome Hopes my Houſhold-Plague is upon his Journey to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for he has been long ling'ring with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Illneſs.

            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0201000402:263"/>I thought it Wiſdom to conceal this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Story from the World; therefore gave it out, thy worthy Father dy'd a natural Death, his long Indiſpoſition giving it Credit. But there was no concealing the End of that miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Woman; therefore, to ſcreen her Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, we reported ſhe had given her Son <hi>Johnny,</hi> by miſtake, Phyſic ſo ſtrong, that had purg'd him into another World. This, with the Loſs of her Husband, we gave out, had turn'd her Brain, ſo that ſhe was forc'd to be ſecur'd in her Cloſet; but in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get out of the Window, met her Fate. Tho' many, I fear, judg'd the true Cauſe of her Death.</p>
            <p>But now, my dear Child, turn thy Thoughts from every melancholy Subject, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lovely <hi>Iſabella</hi> (who was then entring the Chamber) who ſhortly ſhall be thine. I was ever his, reply'd the Charmer of my Soul; and if I had wedded that ridiculous Wretch, whoſe End has brought us into ſome Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it was only out of an obſtinate Revenge for your ſuppos'd Falſhood; but that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge wou'd have fallen upon myſelf, for Death wou'd in a few Days have ended my Miſeries.</p>

            <p>I diſcover'd to my Mother and Aunt the Progreſs of our young Amours, whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs never rebuk'd me for my Weakneſs, but thought as I did, that you were falſe.

            <p>With much Perſuaſion of your Rival, and my Friends, I fix'd the Day of our Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials; and, to ſay the Truth, his Behaviour
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0201000402:265"/>
was much mended, he ſeem'd to wear a more ſolid Air, and expreſs'd his Love with ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere a Freedom, that I often wiſh'd I cou'd give him that Heart you held ſo faſt.</p>
            <p>The Night before the Morning intended for my Nuptials, was ſpent in the utmoſt Grief of Heart; and when my Mother and Aunt came in the Morning, to dreſs me for the Solemnity, I had not Strength to riſe without Help. I was ſeiz'd with a violent Fever, which confin'd me to my Bed for near three Months. The intended Bridegroom ſpent his whole Time at my Chamber-Door, and appear'd inconſolable. I muſt own to you, I began (from his Behaviour) to give him ſome part of my Eſteem; but my Heart was not in my Power to give him, tho' I often wiſh'd it had. I thought it was a moſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Weakneſs, to lament one who paid my Sufferings with Diſdain. Therefore, once more the Day was fix'd; and if all-judging Heaven had not ſent your Friend that very Moment, what but my Death muſt have follow'd, when I had underſtood that my dear <hi>Vaughan</hi> was innocent?</p>
            <p>O Heavens! I reply'd, the very Thought fills me with the utmoſt Agony. Well, well, reply'd my Uncle, when you are once wedded,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0201000402:266"/>
you'll begin to talk like your reaſonable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; at preſent, your Senſes are in a Hurry, and every Faculty bewilder'd in a Maze of I don't know what. But Time and Marriage will reſtore you to your Underſtandings.</p>
            <p>We were interrupted by my Man's telling me Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> was arriv'd, and beg'd to ſee me. When ſhe came in, ſhe look'd wiſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon me, and burſt into Tears. What, <hi>Betty,</hi> ſaid I, are you griev'd to ſee me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? She cou'd not utter one Word, but ran up to me, took me about the Neck, and almoſt drowned me with Weeping. The poor Creature's Love fill'd my Heart with a grateful Tenderneſs. When ſhe had found the Uſe of her Tongue, ſhe cry'd, O my dear Maſter, the Sight of you gives me more Pleaſure than ever I did feel, or can feel. I have not known one Moment's Joy ſince your Abſence. She ſaid ſo many kind things, that I cou'd not refrain kiſſing her tenderly.</p>
            <p>My dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſaid I, you muſt allow Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> ſome ſmall Share in my Heart with you, whoſe faithful Friendſhip, tho' a Servant, I ſhall never forget, and will make it my future Study to recompenſe her uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fidelity. That, Sir, reply'd my Uncle, ſhall be my Care; one Woman is enough
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0201000402:267"/>
for one Man to take care of. You are in the right, reply'd the divine <hi>Iſabella.</hi> But, now I think on't, I have left <hi>Fatima,</hi> and <hi>Eliza,</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to follow your Brother and <hi>Clerimont</hi> to the Priſon, and I came to you, my dear <hi>Vaughan,</hi> to lay my Commands upon you to ſtay with your Uncle till our Return. My Uncle, myſelf, and <hi>Betty,</hi> were uttering the Fulneſs of our Hearts, with the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; when a Perſon that belong'd to the Inn, came running up Stairs in the utmoſt Confuſion, For Heaven's ſake, Sir, ſaid he, run into the Garden, and lend your Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to a Lady that ſome Villains are hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away into a Boat, againſt her Will.</p>
            <p>My Uncle and I ran down upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, with our Swords in our Hands; but, O Heavens! what was my Terror and Sur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prize, when I diſcover'd my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi> in a Boat, held by Force in the Arms of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Stranger to me, and ſix Men rowing down the Stream with their utmoſt Force. The unexpected Sight took away my Senſes, and had I not lean'd my Back againſt a Tree, I muſt have fallen to the Ground.</p>
            <p>There was a ſmall Boat, at the Landing-place in the Garden, which (when I could recover my Strength) I got into ſo ſuddenly,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0201000402:268"/>
that my Uncle cou'd not prevent me. When I had puſh'd it off with my Foot, I found, too late, I had neither Oar nor Pole to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage her, ſo that ſhe drove down the Stream, without my being able to ſtop her.</p>
            <p>My Fury and Impatience almoſt took away my Senſes. The Boat drove for two Hours before it ſtopt againſt a Bank, and then it was ſo dark, when I got out of it, I cou'd not ſee my way. I thought it to no purpoſe to put off the Boat again; and, notwithſtanding my Impatience, I was forc'd to grope about to find ſome Path, but all to no purpoſe; therefore I was wandering about till Day-light, and then had the Misfortune to find I was got upon a little Iſland in the River <hi>Wye.</hi> I then endeavour'd to find the Boat again, but all to no Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I was now plung'd into the utmoſt Deſpair. A thouſand times I form'd Reſolutions fatal to my Life. I accus'd Heaven, Fortune, and unlucky Stars. I cou'd not help ſaying to my ſelf, What Sins have I committed, that my Puniſhment in this World muſt be beyond Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature to bear! How happy did I think myſelf (after all my Misfortunes) but twelve Hours ago! Cou'd mortal Man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, after running thro' ſo many various
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0201000402:269"/>
Scenes of unfortunate Incidents, and then to have the Cure of all my Sorrows within my reach, to have her ſnatch'd from me in my own native Soil, a Country fam'd for her wholſome Laws, by a Stranger? for I own, I cou'd not remember I had ever obſerv'd the Face of the villainous Raviſher. I ſometimes imagin'd it was all a Dream; but, to my cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Grief, I was too well aſſur'd I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.</p>
            <p>I waited till the Sun had made a full three Hours Courſe, upon the Iſland, in hope my Uncle, and my Friends, wou'd find ſome means of following me, but to no purpoſe. I cou'd hear People talk upon the Shore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Willows, but when I call'd to 'em for their Aſſiſtance, cou'd get no Anſwer. My Mind was ſo diſturb'd, that my Reaſon ſeem'd to fly me; and my Spirits were ſo low and faint, that I had not Strength to walk. However, I took the Reſolution of plunging into the Water, to ſwim to the oppoſite Shore; but the Weight of my Cloaths, the Rapidity of the Stream, and my Weakneſs, hurry'd me to the Bottom; and if I had not been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by two Fiſhermen, who were mending their Nets on the Shore, and ſaw me throw myſelf into the Water, I muſt have inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0201000402:270"/>
periſh'd. They drew me into their Boat (depriv'd of Senſe for ſome time) and carry'd me to their Cottage, ſtrip'd me of my wet Cloaths, and put me to Bed. When I came to myſelf, I bewail'd my Misfortunes in ſuch a manner, that the Fiſhermen imagin'd I had thrown myſelf into the River, to put an end to 'em. Upon that Suppoſition, they began to comfort me, and inquir'd into the Cauſe of my Sorrows. But when I had inform'd 'em, one of 'em cry'd out to the other, As ſure as can be, the Woman we heard laſt Night cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Help! was the very Perſon this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is in queſt of.</p>
            <p>They told me, about an Hour after Day was ſhut in, laſt Night, they heard a Lady cry violently, and a Man comforting her; but the Boatmen row'd ſo faſt down the Stream, they were ſoon out of Hearing. This Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge rous'd up my Spirits, and the Thoughts of Vengeance gave me new Strength. I got my Cloaths dry'd with the utmoſt Expedition, and dreſs'd myſelf; but inquiring after my Hat and Sword, they reply'd, they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them. I did not doubt, but I had loſt 'em when I was in the Water, yet was diſtreſs'd how to get more. The Fiſhermen offer'd to carry me in their Boat to <hi>Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0201000402:271"/>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chepſtow</hi> in <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> a Market-Town, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the River <hi>Wye,</hi> very near where that River falls into the <hi>Severn,</hi> with a large wooden Bridge over it. There is a natural Fortification of Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, tho' it has been formerly fortify'd. There is ſtill the Remains of an old Caſtle, built by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> (as the Inhabitants will have it.) The Tide flows here fourteen Yards high.</note>, where I might accommodate myſelf. I accepted of their Offer, and we got into their Boat upon the Inſtant. However, I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd a Hat of one of 'em, and an old Pair of Horſe-Piſtols, the only Arms that belong'd to them. The Boat was a very old ſluggiſh one, that did not anſwer my impatient Deſire of getting to the Town, and it was with much Perſuaſion I did not go on Shore to walk. They told me, about a Mile farther, there was a little Creek, where I might land, and walk to <hi>Chepſtow</hi> ſooner than the Boat cou'd get there. When we came into the Creek, we perceiv'd a Boat, with a Man aſleep in't, and I ſtrongly imagin'd it was the very Boat that the Raviſher had row'd away in, with my dear <hi>Iſabella.</hi> My Blood, at that Thought, thrill'd thro' my Veins, and I was juſt ready to ſhoot the poor Wretch, as he lay aſleep in the Boat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0201000402:272"/>I order'd my two Fiſhermen to row up cloſe to the other Boat; but the Noiſe of our Oars awak'd the Man, who ſtarted up to look at us. As ſoon as I came near enough to lay hold of the Fellow, I ſeiz'd him by the Throat, and clap'd a Piſtol to his Head. The Man was ſo ſcar'd at my manner of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was ready to die with Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Villain! ſaid I, if thou doſt not this Moment declare where thy vile Maſter has carry'd the young Lady he took away by Force Yeſterday, this Moment is thy laſt. For Heaven's ſake, reply'd the Fellow, don't murder an innocent Man, that has done nothing but by the Command of his Maſter, whom he is oblig'd to obey. As for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you mention, I know no more where ſhe is gone, than you do. All that I do know, I'll tell you with all my Heart.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> landed at this Place, late laſt Night, with the Lady and his Servants. My Maſter, the Owner of this Boat, attended him, telling me he wou'd return by Break of Day this Morning, and ordering me to take care of the Boat in the mean time. I own, I am very much in fear ſome Accident has befallen him. I do ſuppoſe he went laſt Night to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> with Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> and his Lady,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0201000402:273"/>
whom he ſeiz'd at <hi>Monmouth</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> ſeated upon the River <hi>Wye,</hi> is an old Town of great Antiquity, as appears by the Ruins of its Walls and Caſtle. It is ſurrounded with Hills. This Place is famous for the Birth of our <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, who conquer'd a great Part of <hi>France</hi>; as alſo for our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtorian, <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey of Monmouth,</hi> tho' a Writer full of the Monkiſh Tales of thoſe Times.</note>. He inform'd my Maſter, that the Day he marry'd her, ſhe ran away with a young Gentleman, which I ſuppoſe to be yourſelf. But, dear Sir, blame not me, I am, as I told you before, but a Servant to the Owner of the Boat. Sir <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtace!</hi> I cry'd, is that Villain ſtill living? or do you abuſe me? Really, reply'd the Man, I know no more than that my Maſter call'd him ſo; and if it is the ſame that you mean, he is lately recover'd of a dangerous Wound he receiv'd about a Month ago, by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>I cou'd not help crying out, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Tranſport of Fury, Yes, it is the ſame, and Heaven has permitted the Wretch to live, that I, with my own Hand, may take ſure Vengeance on ſuch a Villain, for all the Miſery he has heap'd upon my Head. I then inform'd the Man (in ſhort) of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0201000402:274"/>
of that infamous Traitor, Sir <hi>Euſtace.</hi> My two Fiſhermen, and he, ſeem'd thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck at the Relation. My Fiſhermen were afraid to aſſiſt me any further; they did not doubt, they ſaid, if ſuch a baſe Man ſhould hear of it, he wou'd not ſtick to have them murder'd; for they had often heard of his vile Actions in the Country. But when I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd 'em my Uncle (naming his Name) had as many powerful Friends in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as he had; one of the Men cry'd, What, Sir, are you the Nephew to that worthy Gentleman? When I anſwer'd in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, he told me, he wou'd run the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his Life to ſerve me, upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; nay, and anſwer for his Companion: We owe both our Lives to him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my own unhappy Condition, I cou'd not refrain asking the Man, which way my Uncle had been ſo ſerviceable to them?</p>
            <p>Sir, reply'd the Man, my Companion and I were taken up for a Murder and Robbery, and tho' innocent as yourſelf, yet the Jury found us Guilty: Nay, we muſt own, the Appearances were ſtrong againſt us. I'll give your Honour the Story in as few Words as poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0201000402:275"/>About three Quarters of a Year ago, as my Partner and I were fiſhing in this River, we perceiv'd a Hat floating down the Stream, which we took up. We waited ſome Hours, imagining ſome Body wou'd come to claim it; but no one appearing, my Partner gave me half a Crown for my Share, being in more want of a Hat than myſelf. He wore it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Sundays and Holidays, without any one claiming it. About the Time we found the Hat, a young Fellow frequented a by Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in the Neighbourhood, for two or three Days, where my Companion and I us'd often to drink. One Day, while we were there, he offer'd to pawn a gold Medal to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord of the Houſe; he not having Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſpare, came to me, and deſired I wou'd lend him three Guineas upon it, the Medal weighing, at leaſt, five Guineas: I made no Scruple, but let the young Man have the Money, with this Agreement, that if he did not redeem it in a Fortnight, I wou'd diſpoſe of it, for I told him, I cou'd not be out of my Money for a longer Time. He conſented, and the next Evening diſappear'd of a ſudden.</p>
            <p>The following Day, as we were drawing our Nets, we perceiv'd ſomething very heavy;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0201000402:276"/>
but we were very much ſurpris'd, when drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it aſhore, to find a murder'd Body in it, with ſeveral Wounds upon the Head, in a light-colour'd Suit of Cloaths, trim'd with a ſmall Silver Edging. We acquainted the Country with it, and the next Day it was own'd to be an old Lady's Son, who had been miſſing ſome time. The Corps was bury'd by the ſorrowful Mother, and no Enquiry cou'd find out the Murderer.</p>
            <p>A few Days after this, the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holidays came on, and my Partner and I went to ſee ſome Friends at <hi>Monmouth</hi>; but my chief Reaſon of going, was to diſpoſe of my gold Medal. My Companion went to have his Hat done ſomething to; while I went to a Goldſmith's to diſpoſe of my Medal. When I offer'd it to the Man of the Shop, he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it very narrowly, then looking me wiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Face, ask'd me, how I came by it? When I had inform'd him, he reply'd, Very well, I'll carry it to a Perſon in the Neighbourhood, that perhaps will give more than the Weight of it. I ſeem'd very well ſatisfy'd.</p>
            <p>The Goldſmith went out, but return'd in a Quarter of an Hour, with the Conſtable and ſeveral Aſſiſtants, and, in ſhort, charg'd
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0201000402:277"/>
me with the Murder and Robbery of the Widow's Son. I was inſtantly carry'd before a Juſtice, and examin'd; and before my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination was over, my Partner was brought in by the Hatter, who ſwore, the Hat he brought to him, he ſold to the young unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Gentleman that was murder'd. Theſe Circumſtances meeting thus together, it was agreed on all Hands, that we were guilty of the Murder; and what confirm'd People's Opinion was, that the Landlord of the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where I had the Medal, deny'd the Fact.</p>
            <p>Upon this, we gave up ourſelves for loſt. I having ſome ſmall Share of Education, drew up our Caſe, to be preſented to the Judges, but it did us no good, for we were condemn'd to die, for the Guilt of another Perſon.</p>
            <p>Your good Uncle was at the Trial by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and whether by our Countenance, or ſome Proceedings in our Trial, I can't tell, but he ſeem'd to think us innocent. He exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd us ſtrictly about the young Man I had the Medal from, as to his Age, Shape, Size, and what Dreſs he wore. When he had done that, he left us, deſiring us to recommend our ſelves to Heaven, tho' he own'd, he thought
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0201000402:278"/>
we dy'd for an Act we had never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>We prepar'd ourſelves for Death, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt Hopes of Life. The Morning that was intended for our Execution, your good Uncle enter'd our Room in the Priſon, firſt preparing, by degrees, our Spirits, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the unlook'd-for Change in our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He inform'd us, we were at our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and brought a Surgeon with him, whom he order'd to let us both Blood.</p>
            <p>I was (ſaid your Uncle) convinc'd of your Innocency; but what made me more aſſur'd of it, was, that I had ſeen a young Fellow taken up at <hi>Hereford,</hi> where I had ſome Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for offering to ſell a gold Watch, that he cou'd give but a ſlender Account how he came by it. I came into the Court at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> juſt as your Trial came on. After you were found Guilty, I inform'd the Judges of my Suſpicions, and I thought it the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every Gentleman to uſe his Endeavour to clear the Innocent. I immediately return'd to <hi>Hereford</hi> (after enquiring of you all the Circumſtances of your Defence) and dealt with the Priſoner ſo effectually, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd every thing. He inform'd me, that he had been long a Companion to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0201000402:279"/>
Son, and both living a diſorderly Life, he prevail'd upon him to rob his Mother of a Sum of Money, and imbark for the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>; but the Devil put it into his Mind to murder him, which he did, by firſt ſtabbing him with a pointed Hanger; and after cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him over the Head with the ſame Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, for fear his Groans might be overheard by ſomebody by Accident, he took from him a Purſe of ſixty-four Guineas, the fatal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, a Diamond Ring, and the gold Watch he was taken up for, in endeavouring to ſell it at <hi>Hereford.</hi> The poor Wretch was aſſur'd that Heaven wou'd not let Murder be hid; for, as he intended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might have diſpos'd of both Medal and Watch with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there. But he knew the Devil infatuated his Mind.</p>
            <p>Your good Uncle (continu'd the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) made him ſign his Confeſſion; and he took ſuch farther Meaſures with the Judges, that he procur'd our Liberty; and not only that, but made a Gathering for us among the Gentlemen of the Country, that amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (with his own Bounty) to an hundred and thirty five Pounds.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, ſince you are Nephew to that noble Gentleman to whom we owe our Lives
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0201000402:280"/>
and Fortunes, command us what you pleaſe, as far as Honeſty and our Power may carry us, and we will inſtantly obey you.</p>
            <p>While the Fiſherman was relating this ſhort Story, his Companion ſpy'd a Hat floating againſt the Bank of the Creek, which I knew to be my own, but both the Men were ſo very much ſtartled at the Sight of it, that neither of 'em wou'd take it up. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I got the young Fellow in the other Boat, who was not ſo ſcrupulous, to get it for me, who, underſtanding the villainous Treatment I had receiv'd from the Wretch that hir'd the Boat of his Maſter, was reſolv'd to join with the other two.</p>
            <p>While we were conſulting how to proceed, the Owner of the Boat came down to the Creek. My Blood roſe at the Man, tho' I knew he had been impos'd upon by that baſe Villain, Sir <hi>Euſtace.</hi> However, I reſolv'd to be ſilent, in hope I ſhou'd learn ſomething from him. As ſoon as he came near enough, his Man ask'd him, how he could leave him all Night in ſuch a Place, without Victuals, Drink, or Reſt? Z—ds! reply'd the Man, you have had more Reſt than I, I dare ſwear. Never was poor Wretch ſo ill us'd, as I have been. When I came within a Quarter of a
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0201000402:281"/>
Mile of <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> the Villain order'd his Servants to bind my Hands and Feet, and throw me into a Ditch, which, by good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, prov'd a dry one. The Reaſon why, my Friend (cry'd the Brute) I part with your good Company, is, becauſe I wou'd not have you know where I intend to lie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; perhaps, in a little Time, I ſhall find ſome Method of ſatisfying you for the Trouble you have been at, upon my account. And ſo, Friend, I wiſh you a good Night's Reſt!</p>
            <p>Upon ſaying this, he, and his wicked Crew, walk'd away, although I begg'd to be releas'd, promiſing I would return to my Boat, without following them. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, No, no! that is one Reaſon why I would have you lie there all Night.</p>
            <p>Pray Friend, ſaid I, in what Condition was the poor young Lady, that he forcibly carry'd away? Why truly, Sir, reply'd the Man, I can't well tell, for ſhe had mourn'd ſo much in the Boat, that when we landed, ſhe did not utter a Word, but ſuffer'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be led by her Husband, without any Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I ſoon undeceiv'd him in that Particular, by acquainting him with the Truth of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0201000402:282"/>
ſorrowful Affair. And is it ſo? reply'd the Maſter of the Boat. If I had known that, no Recompence, or Threats, ſhould have prevail'd upon me to have lent him any Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſuch a baſe Action.</p>
            <p>After a ſhort Conſultation, I reſolv'd with the Maſter of the Boat, to go by Land to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> while the two Fiſhermen, and the other Man, carry'd the Boats there.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we parted: But as ſoon as we enter'd the Town, the firſt Perſons I ſaw were, my dear Uncle, my Brother, my Friend, and <hi>Clerimont,</hi> with four Servants, all well arm'd, in ſearch after the Raviſher and me. They hir'd a Boat at <hi>Monmouth,</hi> with all the Expedition imaginable, thinking to overtake me at leaſt, and, as we all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, miſt me when the Boat I was in, fell in with the little Iſland, where I remain'd all Night. They were going, when we met 'em, down to the Creek, to endeavour the finding the Man that was bound, and thrown into the Ditch, being inform'd of it by the very Perſon that had releas'd him in the Morning.</p>
            <p>We came to a Reſolution of ſeparating: My Brother and I, with two Servants, to get Horſes and go into <hi>Wales,</hi> in purſuit of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0201000402:283"/>
them; my Uncle, my Friend, and the other two Servants, to follow by Water; my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to ſtay at <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> or <hi>Monmouth,</hi> juſt as he thought convenient.</p>
            <p>My Brother and I, with two Servants, ſet out well arm'd for our Purpoſe, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any formal Leave of my Uncle and the reſt; for I was too much concern'd, to mind Ceremony. As we paſs'd the Mountains that environ <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> the Horſe of one of my Uncle's Servants fell down-right lame, which gave me ſome little Uneaſineſs. But the Fellow being Running-Footman to the laſt Maſter he ſerv'd, told us, he would be at the next Town before us, and provide himſelf another Horſe. Accordingly he left the lame one at a Cottage in the Road, and flew away as ſwift as a Greyhound. The Roads were ſo bad for our Horſes, that he was ſoon out of Sight. After riding about four Miles, we came to a ſmall Inn, where I was ſurpriz'd to find him drinking with a Footman at the Door. As ſoon as we came near enough for him to be heard, he call'd out to me, Sir, for a ſmall matter, I can have a Horſe of this Man, who is a Servant to Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi>; and as we are to go within a Mile of his Maſter's Houſe, I am to leave
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0201000402:284"/>
the Horſe at a Place where he has appointed, his Buſineſs not being urgent, he ſays he will walk the reſt of the Way.</p>
            <p>The Name of that Villain, Sir <hi>Euſtace,</hi> and the manner of the Servant's ſpeaking to me, convinc'd me there was ſomething to be underſtood by it. I therefore endeavour'd to compoſe myſelf from the Ruffle the Villain's Name had caus'd in my Soul. I ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the Fellow was very much gone in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, therefore was in ſome Hope of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi> was forc'd. He did not ſeem to have any Notion of us, or our Buſineſs, therefore I told him, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make a Viſit to his Maſter at my Return. Hark ye, Sir, reply'd the Fellow, to tell you the Truth, if you do, you'll loſe your Labour, for my Maſter is not at home at preſent, neither can I tell you when he will be at home. Nor does he much care, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted my Uncle's Man, for I find his Maſter and he don't ſet their Horſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I muſt own I did tell you ſo, return'd the Man, but you are to blame to let all the World know it. There's no Harm done, I reply'd; he knows I want a Servant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you intend to leave Sir <hi>Euſtace,</hi> and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0201000402:285"/>
he'll give you a Character, I'll take you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Service. A Character, Sir! (cry'd the Man, haſtily) I am afraid his Character will be but ſmall Encouragement for me to get another Maſter. I muſt conceal, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, my ever living with him. Sir, I muſt beg your Pardon, when I tell you (as one of my Maſters Acquaintance) he is ſo wicked a Man, that I think no one, that is not as wicked as himſelf, would live with him.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I ſoon found the Fellow was too honeſt in his Principles, for ſo impious a Maſter. And yet, one wou'd think (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd the Servant) he ſhou'd take Warning. It is not above ſix Weeks ago, when a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman he had ill us'd, in Diſguiſe, run him through the Body. We all thought he wou'd have breath'd his laſt; but he recover'd in leſs than a Month, the Wound not being through any Mortal Part. He order'd his Servants and the Surgeon to conceal his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from the Country: But we were ſoon let into the Meaning of it; for he went diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd, two Days ago, to <hi>Monmouth,</hi> under Pretence to take up the Gentleman for his ſuppoſed Murder; but it was only to take his Opportunity of running away with a young Lady, whom he ſays he's contracted
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0201000402:286"/>
to; which he did, and is now gone to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> for more Secrecy and Security, where he intends to force the Lady to marry him, or perhaps worſe.</p>
            <p>I was ſo much diſorder'd with what the Man ſaid to me, my Paſſion overcoming my Reaſon, that I declar'd aloud, I wou'd be the Death of him. The poor Fellow began to ſuſpect ſomething; and the Apprehenſion of ſome Ill Uſage threw him into ſuch a Fit of Trembling, that he ſoon became ſober. He begg'd for Heaven's ſake, he might not ſuffer for the Evil Deeds of his Maſter.</p>
            <p>No, my Friend, ſaid I, I have ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for thee, for thy Honeſty, becauſe I think, by thy Diſcourſe, thou doſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the wicked Deſigns of that baſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. Therefore, if thou wilt receive me for thy Maſter, be aſſur'd it is in my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to uſe every one well, that has any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon me.</p>
            <p>Sir, reply'd the young Fellow, you ſeem ſo far different in your Behaviour from my preſent Maſter, that I ſhall think myſelf got out of Purgatory into Paradiſe. We ſoon made an Agreement, to the Satisfaction of us both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0201000402:287"/>He then inform'd me, his Maſter had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd him to his Caſtle in <hi>Wales,</hi> for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Neceſſaries for himſelf, and the Servants that were gone with him to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which were privately to be brought in a Waggon; for he apprehended it was not ſafe to bring the Lady home immediately, not doubting, in the leaſt, but the Gentleman that wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him before, wou'd purſue him, with the Company he had ſo much exaſperated by his villainous Proceeding.</p>
            <p>Upon the Knowledge of this, we return'd back to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> in order to get to <hi>Briſtol</hi> with the utmoſt Expedition. When we came back to <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> we were inform'd, my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, with his Party, had hir'd a Veſſel to go for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which made us imagine he had gain'd ſome Knowledge of the Place where they were gone.</p>
            <p>We only ſtaid to give our Horſes ſome ſmall Refreſhment, and ſet forward by Land for <hi>Briſtol</hi>; tho' we were two Hours ferry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over.</p>
            <p>When we arriv'd at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> my new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant told me, his old Maſter was at Captain — in <hi>Radcliff</hi> Street, over-againſt the Church. My Brother and I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd ourſelves in our Servants Cloaths, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0201000402:288"/>
went to the Houſe where we were inform'd Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> and my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi> were. The Door was ſhut ſome time; but after half an Hour's waiting, we ſaw the Villain coming out with a Gentleman, that we ſuppos'd to be the Maſter of the Houſe. My Blood flew with ſuch Violence thro' my Veins, that it was with much Perſuaſion of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I had not ſhot the Villain through the Head. But he advis'd me to uſe Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.</p>
            <p>Let us, ſaid he, ſend for your new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and by the time he comes, we'll think of ſomething to compaſs our Ends, without Bloodſhed. When the Servant came, we inſtructed him to go to the Lady, as from his Maſter, and with a Ring as a Token for his Paſſport, which I gave him, which was my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s, I did not doubt but ſhe would know it again, and come more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p>My new Man did his Buſineſs dexterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He found the Chamber of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> guarded by two of his old Fellow-Servants, who made no Scruple of letting him paſs, when he acquainted them he had Orders to conduct the Lady to his Maſter, in order to be marry'd that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0201000402:289"/>When he came into the Room, where the divine <hi>Iſabella</hi> was lamenting her Condition in Tears and Sighs, upon the Floor, he, without Ceremony, gave her the Ring, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her, the Owner of it waited for her in the Street; if ſhe cou'd give Credit to that Paſſport, ſhe might be in the Arms of her devoted Husband in a few Minutes. She look'd upon the Ring ſome time, with the utmoſt Tranſport of Joy (as the Man told us afterwards) and at laſt ſaid, Though my terrible Misfortunes make me ſuſpect every thing, and every Perſon, yet, whatever Hands I fall into, I can't fear worſe Uſage than from thoſe I have the Misfortune to be in at preſent.</p>
            <p>She then gave my new Servant her Hand, who led her down Stairs, telling the two Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at the Door, to order a handſome Supper, for their Maſter wou'd be back in leſs than an Hour.</p>
            <p>When we perceiv'd him coming with the divine <hi>Iſabella,</hi> I trembled ſo much, I had not Power to ſtand; but my Brother, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Tranſports might diſcover us, led me ſome diſtance from the Houſe. But when my lovely <hi>Iſabella</hi> came up to me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us cou'd utter a Word. My Brother
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0201000402:290"/>
wou'd not let us ſtay to open our Hearts, but took hold of my dear <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and hurry'd her along, while I follow'd, not knowing what I was doing.</p>
            <p>As we were croſſing the Bridge, we met my Uncle and his Party, they not expecting to meet us. By the Light of the Shops upon the Bridge, knowing <hi>Iſabella,</hi> they drew their Swords; and had not my Brother diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd himſelf that Inſtant, ſome of my Friends had probably loſt their Lives; for, in the Heat of my Fury, I miſtook them, as they did us, and drew my Piſtols; but the firſt flaſhing in the Pan, prevented my doing an Action that I ſhould have for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>
            <p>We had not time to congratulate each other, upon our unexpected meeting; but my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Friends, finding we had regain'd <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> led us back to the Boat they came in, and, notwithſtanding the Darkneſs of the Night, we ſet out from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſo eagerly, that we forgot my Uncle's two Servants at the Inn, who were found watching about the Houſe where <hi>Iſabella</hi> was confin'd by Sir <hi>Euſtace,</hi> who, by Threats, got out of them, who they belong'd to. A Fellow that ſaw our Rencounter upon the Bridge, had follow'd
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0201000402:291"/>
us to the Boat, and hearing Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my Uncle's Servants, declar'd what he knew concerning us.</p>
            <p>Upon this, he got his Men together, took a Boat, and follow'd us with ſuch Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the two Servants of my Uncle's were ſo frighted for my Safety, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maſter was with me, that they got a Guide to conduct them along the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to give us Notice of our approaching Danger, as they told us afterwards.</p>
            <p>While we were in the Boat, my dear <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> and I, mingled our Tears of Joy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She told me when the hated Villain firſt ſeiz'd her, ſhe had Recourſe to Tears, Sighs, and Reproaches, which drew nothing but Threats from the worthleſs Wretch: But at laſt, ſhe thought it wou'd be more to her purpoſe to diſſemble her Sorrows; therefore ſhe ſeem'd, by degrees, to dry up her Tears, and liſten more favourably to his odious Love.</p>
            <p>This Method deceiv'd him ſo effectually, that he did not doubt but ſhe wou'd give her Conſent to the Marriage in a few Days. She had prevail'd upon one of his Men to bring a Letter to me, and he was to ſet out on the following Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0201000402:292"/>We landed at <hi>Weſton,</hi> and order'd our Boat to meet us at <hi>Thornbury</hi> the next Day, where we were oblig'd to go altogether, in a Waggon, not meeting with any better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency. But having the Company of my lovely <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with my Uncle and Friends, I was in as much Joy, as if we were riding in our Coach and Six.</p>
            <p>When we came within half a Mile of <hi>Thornbury,</hi> the Fields being pleaſant, we all got out to walk. I, with my charming <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> led the Way, full of the delightful Hope of poſſeſſing for ever that Beauty, who was the Treaſure of my Soul.</p>
            <p>Juſt as we croſs'd a Stile that led into the Horſe Road, I obſerv'd four or five Men run into a Thicket, that led into the Fields, on the other Side of the Road. This alarm'd me very much, and I made a full Stop till my Company came up.</p>
            <p>By ill Fortune (expecting no Danger) we had left our Piſtols in the Waggon, and the ſhorter Cut being over the Fields, the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was a Quarter of a Mile behind us. While we were diſputing what to do, the five Men came running croſs the Road, with that infamous Villain, Sir <hi>Euſtace,</hi> at the Head of them. My Friend knowing him,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0201000402:293"/>
ran to oppoſe him, unarm'd as he was. The Villain fir'd a Piſtol at him, which brought my Friend to the Ground. The Sight rais'd ſuch a Rage in my Soul, that I ruſh'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, juſt as he preſented a Piſtol to my Breaſt, and ſo opportunely, that I clapt my Hand between the Flint and the Lock, juſt as he drew the Trigger, and, with ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to wrench it from him, the Flint cut the Back of my Hand very much. I at laſt, with much Difficulty, wrung it from him, and ſhot him through the Head with his own Piſtol.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he fell, his Companions in Villainy ran away, without once looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them; and I flew to my Friend, who, thank Heaven, was only wounded ſlightly on the Temple.</p>
            <p>This was all done ſo ſuddenly, that it look'd like a Dream. When the Confuſion was over, we went to examine that impious Wretch, who, notwithſtanding his Villainy, I wiſh'd in my Soul he had Life enough left to repent. But alas! he was gone for ever, with all his Sins about him.</p>
            <p>When we came to <hi>Thornbury,</hi> our Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men met us, with a Croud of People, arm'd with ſeveral Weapons, coming to our Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0201000402:294"/>
The unfortunate Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took them in their ſhort Voyage to <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and by Threats made them (though unwillingly) confeſs where they were to take us up. As ſoon as Sir <hi>Euſtace</hi> parted from them, to put his wicked Intentions in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the Boatmen alarm'd the Town, which we met coming to our Aſſiſtance, tho' too late.</p>
            <p>I went to a neighbouring Juſtice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd what had happen'd, who took Bail of my Uncle for my Appearance at the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: But I was never troubled about it. His Servants were found, who took up the Body, which was interr'd privately by his younger Brother, a worthy Gentleman, that prov'd as much an Honour to the Family he ſprung from, as the other ſtrove to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it.</p>
            <p>The next Day we embark'd for <hi>Chepſtow,</hi> and the ſame Evening arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> to the Comfort of my Governor, <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira,</hi> and the amiable <hi>Fatima.</hi> From thence we ſet out for my Uncle's.</p>
            <p>In a few Days after, my Brother with the fair <hi>Fatima</hi> (after receiving at the Font the Chriſtian Name of <hi>Maria,</hi> at my Uncle's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt) <hi>Clerimont</hi> and his <hi>Eliza,</hi> and my dear <hi>Iſabella</hi> and I, join'd thoſe Hands, with the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0201000402:295"/>
Aſſiſtance of the Prieſt, whoſe Hearts were united long before. And that we might be witneſs to each others Happineſs, all dwelt in the ſame Houſe with my Uncle.</p>
            <p>Thus, after ſo many Storms of Fortune, we arriv'd ſafe in the Harbour of Delight, and [taſted Joys beyond Expreſſion. Long may our Years continue, in all the Harmony of connubial Love! All our Wiſhes are, to go Step by Step together; and when the hoary Winter of our Age approaches, to ſink Hand in Hand into the Grave, and reſt in Peace.</p>
