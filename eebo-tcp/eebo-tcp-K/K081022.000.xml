            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>OUR deſp'rate Bard a bold Excurſion tries,</l>
                  <l>Tho' Danger damp'd his Wing, he dar'd to riſe;</l>
                  <l>From Hope, high rais'd, all glorious Actions ſpring;</l>
                  <l>'Tis hence that Heroes conquer, Poets ſing.</l>
                  <l>Even he may feel the ſoul-exalting Fire,</l>
                  <l>Fame prompts the humbleſt Boſom to aſpire.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Without a Guide this raſh Attempt he made,</l>
                  <l>Without a Clue from Art, or Learning's Aid.</l>
                  <l>He takes a Theme where tend'reſt Paſſions glow,</l>
                  <l>A Theme, your Grandſires felt with pleaſing Woe,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>ESSEX'</hi> ſad Tale he ſtrives to cloath anew,</l>
                  <l>And hopes to place it in a ſtronger View.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Poets, like Painters, may, by equal Law,</l>
                  <l>The labour'd Piece from different Maſters draw,</l>
                  <l>Perhaps improve the Plan, add Fire and Grace,</l>
                  <l>And ſtrike th' impaſſion'd Soul through all the Face.</l>
                  <l>How far our Author has ſecur'd a Claim</l>
                  <l>To this exalted Palm, this wiſh'd-for Fame,</l>
                  <l>Your generous Sentiments will ſoon declare:</l>
                  <l>Humanity is ever prone to ſpare.</l>
                  <l>'Twere Baſeneſs then your Candour to diſtruſt;</l>
                  <l>A <hi>BRITISH</hi> Audience will, at leaſt, be juſt.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A flattering Truth he fearful muſt confeſs,</l>
                  <l>His ſanguine Friends made Promiſe of Succeſs;</l>
                  <l>But that, he fears, their ardent Wiſhes wrought,</l>
                  <l>Since partial Favour ſeldom ſees a Fault.</l>
                  <l>Then bear, like patient Friends, this firſt Eſſay,</l>
                  <l>His next ſhall thank you in a nobler Way.</l>

            <byline>By an Unknown Hand. Spoken by Mrs. CIBBER.</byline>
            <sp>
               <l>NEWS! News! good Folks, rare News, and you ſhall know it—</l>
               <l>I've got Intelligence about our Poet!</l>
               <l>Who do you think be is?—You'll never gueſs;</l>
               <l>An <hi>IRISH BRICKLAYER,</hi> neither more or leſs.</l>
               <l>And now the Secret's out, you cannot wonder,</l>
               <l>That in commencing Bard he made a Blunder.</l>
               <l>Has be not left the Better for the Worſe,</l>
               <l>In quitting Solid Brick for empty Verſe?</l>
               <l>Can he believe th' Example of <hi>Old Ben,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who chang'd (like him) the Trowel for the Pen,</l>
               <l>Will in his Favour move your Critic Bowels?</l>
               <l>You rather wiſh, moſt Poct's Pons were Trowels,</l>
               <l>Our Man is honeſt, ſenſible, and plain,</l>
               <l>Nor has the Poet made him pert, or vain:</l>
               <l>No Beau, no Courtier, nor conceited Youth;</l>
               <l>But then ſo rude, <hi>he always ſpeaks the Truth:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I told him he muſt flatter, learn Addreſs,</l>
               <l>And gain the Heart of ſome rich Patroneſs:</l>
               <l>'Tis ſhe, ſaid I, your Labours will reward,</l>
               <l>If you but join the Bricklay'r with the Bard;</l>
               <l>As thus—Should ſhe be old and worſe for Wear,</l>
               <l>You muſt new-<hi>caſe</hi> her, <hi>front</hi> her and <hi>repair;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If crack'd in Fame, as ſcarce to bear a Touch,</l>
               <l>You cannot uſe your <hi>Trowel</hi> then too much;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0695500200:70"/>
In ſhort, whate'er her Morals, Age or Station,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Plaiſter</hi> and <hi>white-waſh</hi> in your Dedication.</l>
               <l>Thus I advis'd—but he deteſts the Plan:</l>
               <l>What can be done with ſuch a ſimple Man?</l>
               <l>A Poet's nothing worth and nought availing,</l>
               <l>Unleſs he'll furniſh, where there is a Failing.</l>
               <l>Authors in theſe good Times are made and us'd,</l>
               <l>To grant thoſe Favours Nature has refus'd.</l>
               <l>If he won't <hi>fib,</hi> what Bounty can be crave?</l>
               <l>We pay for what we want, not what we have.—</l>
               <l>Nay tho' of every <hi>Bleſſing</hi> we have ſtore,</l>
               <l>Our Sex will always wiſh—a little more.—</l>
               <l>If he'll not bend his Heart to this his Duty,</l>
               <l>And ſell (to who will buy) Wit, Honour, Beauty;</l>
               <l>The Bricklay'r ſtill for him the proper Trade is,</l>
               <l>Too rough to deal with Gentlemen and Ladies.—</l>
               <l>In ſhort—they'll all avoid him and neglect him,</l>
               <l>Unleſs that you his <hi>Patrons</hi> will protect him.</l>
