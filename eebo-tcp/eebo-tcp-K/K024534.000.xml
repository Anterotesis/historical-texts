            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE, CAUSE, and CURE OF THE CROUP.</head>
            <p>THE Science of Medicine has been, gradually, advancing for theſe two thouſand years by paſt; and is now brought to a great degree of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; perhaps to as great a degree, every circumſtance conſidered, as the difficulty of the art, the limitation of the human facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the continual attempts to further refinement, too often conducted merely by fancy, will admit of.</p>
            <p>ONE uſed to conſider the progreſs of the different arts, their gradual advancement to perfection, and their ſubſequent decay, may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0218202600:3"/>be apt to contemplate, with ſome alarm, the preſent ſituation of phyſic. More attention is paid to the claſſing of diſeaſes, as if they were natural and permanent entities, than to the complete hiſtory of each particular one; more to the ſub-diviſion and ſplitting of them into ſeparate ſpecies, from ſome ſlight difference in the ſymptoms, than to the general turn and complexion of the whole diſeaſe; more to the novelty and change of application, than to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is already diſcovered and in uſe. Theſe, a ſpeculative mind will be apt to conſider as proofs of too great refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſtant marks of a future change.</p>
            <p>IT is by a cloſe attention to the hiſtory of particular diſeaſes, that the ſcience has made ſuch great advances. The accuracy of ancient and modern authors hath left few diſeaſes untouched. By deſcribing every circumſtance belonging to them, and the appearances, which occurred, on inſpecting the bodies after death, they have aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt diſeaſes, and laid a foundation for arriving at as certain a knowledge of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0218202600:4"/>reſt, as the narrow limits of our powers will allow. For caſes in medicine are the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of this branch of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p>THERE is one diſeaſe, however, which had entirely eſcaped all regular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and concerning which, there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be learned by inquiry, and ſtill leſs from books; I mean the CROUP. I never have ſeen any thing written on this ſubject, except a Theſis, where the author gives us no facts; and claſſes it amongſt the ſpaſmodic diſtempers, to which it has no reſemblance, either in its progreſs or cure. The <hi>Catarrhus ſuffocativus</hi> of <hi>Etmuller,</hi> tho' it reſembles the Croup in many particulars, yet appears to be a very different diſeaſe in ſome ſymptoms, in the cure, and appearances after deaths.</p>
            <p>DR <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> in his Oeconomy of Nature, deſcribes, in a few lines, a diſeaſe very ſimilar to this, in moſt of its ſymptoms: But it ſeems not exactly the ſame, as it was attended with ulcers about the larynx, and terminated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a ſphacelus of the lungs. Beſides,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0218202600:5"/>had it been the ſame diſeaſe with our Croup, the ſame appearances muſt have occurred, upon diſſection, to him as to us.</p>
            <p>I SHALL, therefore, treat this diſeaſe as entirely unknown as to its nature, cauſe, effects, and cure; and try how far our facts will carry us towards a diſcovery of theſe.</p>
            <p>How ſo ſingular and dangerous a diſeaſe has been totally neglected, while ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been paid to moſt others, is not the leaſt ſurpriſing circumſtance belonging to it. Its external features ought to have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have rouſed an inquiſitive ſearcher into diſeaſes; its internal appearances, if but once ſeen, muſt have raiſed, from their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, the ſtrongeſt deſire to investigate its nature. But theſe ſeem to have been more than counterbalanced by its local ſituation; the unfrequency of its appearance; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which it attacked, theſe being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, and unable to give a diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their complaints; the rapidity of its courſe; the apparent eaſineſs of its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; and their ſimilitude to other catarrhal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0218202600:6"/>or peripneumoniac diſtempers. Theſe ſeem to be ſufficient reaſons for its being ſo long undiſtinguiſhed and undeſcribed, without laying us under any neceſſity of looking on it as a new diſeaſe. Probably it has exiſted more or leſs in all ages; for the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive cauſes muſt have operated formerly, as they do at preſent.</p>
            <p>THIS diſeaſe happens, or at leaſt is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo ſeldom in this city, that very few caſes muſt occur to any particular perſon, during the courſe of a whole lifetime. To have the power of ſeeing more, one muſt put himſelf in the way of intelligence, eſpecially at places ſituated on the coaſt. By that means, I have had an opportunity of attending more caſes, than otherwiſe would have fallen to the ſhare of any one. The danger of the ſymptoms under ſuch apparent eaſe, and the ſingularity of its appearances after death, in the firſt examination, excited my curioſity. The ſubſequent caſes were ſufficient to ſhow me its nature, tho' perhaps not to point out a certain cure. That is not always allowed to mortals. To be able, however, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0218202600:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>it from other diſeaſes; to diſcover the nature of it; to point out when it is cureable, and when not; perhaps to lay a foundation for improvement in its moſt deſperate ſtate; that is the deſign of the following pages.</p>
            <p>To be the firſt author in treating a diſeaſe; to have no aſſiſtance from preceding experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is a ſituation a little uncommon in theſe modern times. To this cauſe, and to the rarity of the diſeaſe, muſt be imputed my not bringing it to that degree of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I could wiſh; and that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in other diſeaſes. If this can ſerve for a foundation to excite others to inquire, to preſerve, and to communicate facts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by them, my labour will be well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
            <p>THIS diſeaſe appears to belong peculiarly to children; and the younger they are, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are weaned, the more liable they ſeem to it. On the breaſt, they appear leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it; or, which is as probable, as they cannot tell their complaints, it is taken for ſome other diſeaſe. I never ſaw, or heard of one, above twelve years of age, affected by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0218202600:8"/>it. After this the body gains a ſtrength capable of reſiſting the cauſe, or of expelling it when received. About this time, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, very great changes happen in the human frame.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, likewiſe, in a great meaſure, to have a local ſituation; and to be very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found at any great diſtance from the ſea-ſhore. It appears much leſs in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> than in <hi>Leith,</hi> or <hi>Muſſelburgh.</hi> It is often ſeen along the coaſt of <hi>Fife;</hi> and is very common, I am told, along the coaſt of <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Galloway.</hi> Tho' I never heard of it in the neighbouring coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> yet probably it is to be found there too. The ſame cauſes, that kept it from being ſo long attended to here, may ſtill make it neglected there. Very wet and marſhy ſituations, ſometimes, produce it.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt hiſtory of a diſeaſe, it becomes abſolutely neceſſary, to ſet down the caſes and the facts, as they really happened. In diſeaſes, that have already been deſcribed, it is ſufficient to enumerate the ſymptoms, as they generally appeared, by which the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt that ſpecies, and any of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0218202600:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>former, may be obſerved. But in a new diſeaſe, as little ought to be left to the fancy or judgment of the hiſtorian as poſſible; for, from the natural appearance of the ſymptoms, all our reaſoning and concluſions muſt take their riſe. As caſes are analogous to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of Natural Philoſophy, they ought to be deſcribed as circumſtantially. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi> that great hiſtorian of diſeaſes, treats his epidemics, as they were new diſtempers, in this way.</p>

               <head>CASE I.</head>
               <p>MARCH 15th. Was called to Miſs****, aged fifteen months, of an inflammatory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and living within a quarter of a mile of the ſea-ſhore. The day before, ſhe had appeared duller and hotter than uſual. This morning ſhe was attacked with a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing. Her pulſe was ſtrong, and about 135 in a minute; five ounces of blood was immediately taken from her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, ſhe was ſeized with the ſharp ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolous voice, which I can reſemble to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more nearly than the crowing of a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0218202600:10"/>cock; and which is the true diagnoſtic ſign of this diſeaſe. She had a quick and high breathing, and unuſual heat in her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and palms of her hands. Her feet and hands were ſwelled, and had an aedematous appearance. As her pulſe was ſtill ſtrong, five ounces of blood was again taken from her, which ſeemed to eaſe her greatly. The ſteams of warm water and vinegar made her ſpit up, and did her ſervice. Her belly was kept conſtantly looſe with <hi>magneſia alba;</hi> and that night a bliſter was applied round her neck. On the third day, ſhe was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſier; but the voice ſtill remained ſhrill, the breathing high, and pulſe ſtrong. At night four leeches were applied to her throat; and the orifices, conſtantly fomented with warm water, continued blooding for four hours. Next morning all the ſymptoms went off. In this caſe, the repeated blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, eſpecially the local one, with internal and external fomentation, did moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice. I was not ſo certain about the effects of the bliſter.</p>

               <p>MISS ******, aged eighteen months, healthful, living near a great loch, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile diſtant from the ſea, was ſeized, <hi>March</hi> 30th, with the Croup. She had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately loſt five ounces of blood by leeches, and had got a vomit. Next morning, ſhe had taken a ſecond vomit, after which I firſt ſaw her. Her voice had the characteriſtical ſhrillneſs, only, when ſhe raiſed it, or cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Her breathing was quick. Pulſe about 130. and rather weak. Dry, rough, ſhort cough. She had no pain in ſwallowing, but ſhowed uneaſineſs when ſhe turned about her head. Urine clear, and without ſediment. The ſteams of warm water and vinegar, and a bliſter round the neck, were ordered. In the evening ſhe was better, and her lungs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſomewhat moiſter. That night ſhe reſted pretty well; and on the third day her voice was natural, except when ſhe coughed. She had a running at the noſe, and there was a cloud in the urine. The vomit repeated. On the fourth day, the voice was ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0218202600:12"/>unnatural. The urine now depoſited a light ſediment, which laſted for three or four days, during which ſhe gradually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. She had the ſame diſeaſe again ſix months after, but in a ſlighter manner.</p>

               <head>CASE III.</head>
               <p>A CHILD two years old, who had had the ſmall pox ſix weeks before, had been ſeized, Auguſt 8th, with the croupy voice. Leeches had been applied, and bliſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ears, and to the throat: On the 12th, I ſaw him, and ſound his breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad, great ſtuffing, ſhrill voice, and a ſwelling externally on the ſuperior part of the <hi>trachea.</hi> Pulſe 140. Every thing look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ill. Steams, external fomentation, poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and ſeveral leeches were applied to the throat. 13th, the child greatly relieved, more chearful, and voice more natural. 14th, pulſe much better, and the peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of voice and the ſwelling almoſt gone.</p>
               <p>I NEED not relate more caſes of this kind, as ſuch like commonly occur, and as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0218202600:13"/>they are ſufficient to prove its nature in this ſituation. The only remark that I ſhall make is, that the ſymptoms of theſe three patients, and their cure, ſhow plainly the Croup, in this ſtate, to be a diſeaſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory nature, attacking the organs of voice and reſpiration, particularly the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior parts of the <hi>trachea,</hi> and that the local inflammation often ends by reſolution. This diſeaſe appears to be confined chiefly to the <hi>trachea,</hi> as the patients have no pain in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition; as they generally complain, when they are of an age to ſpeak, of a dull pain in the upper part of it; as ſometimes an external ſwelling is ſeen there; and as the <hi>fauces</hi> are at moſt but a little redder.</p>
               <p>LET us now ſee what light other ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the diſeaſe, and inſpection into the morbid body, will give us.</p>

               <head>CASE IV.</head>
               <p>SEPTEMBER 29th, 1760, was called to a boy of ſeven years of age, who had been ſome days ſick. He lived on <hi>Leith</hi> bridge, had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0218202600:14"/>been ill of the chin-cough the preceeding winter, and had recovered of the meaſles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix weeks before this.

When I ſaw him, his pulſe was quick, with a little degree of hardneſs, but not ſtrong. He ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed eaſily; but complained of a pain in the <hi>trachea,</hi> when he ſpoke, or when I preſſed it with my fingers.

He ſometimes expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and had often frothy <hi>ſaliva</hi> upon his lips. The urine had a white ouzy ſediment. His ſenſes and his head were quite clear and diſtinct. He was immediately blooded, and at night had leeches applied to his throat, and a bliſter round it. The next day his pulſe was weaker, and beat 175 in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.

               <p>ON laying open the parts, there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any inflammation on the <hi>fauces.</hi> But, to my great ſurpriſe, the whole ſuperior internal ſurface of the <hi>trachea</hi> was covered with a white ſoft thick preternatural coat or membrane, eaſily ſeparable from it, and generally lying looſe upon it, and purulent matter lodged below, and around it. The ſubjacent parts were red; but no great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of inflammation. As we ſearched downwards, the ſame appearances continued thro' the ramifications of the <hi>aſpera arteria,</hi> tho' the membrane ſeemed here ſofter, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to become of a more purulent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. All the branches of the windpipe and <hi>bronchiae</hi> were filled with purulent matter; and we could eaſily ſqueeze it out, in great plenty, from all theſe pipes. The ſubſtance of the lungs was quite ſound, and in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate.</p>
               <p>THESE circumſtances appeared, at that time, ſo new and ſurpriſing to me, that I looked on them as accidental, and not the natural effects of the diſeaſe. But I was ſoon convinced of the contrary.</p>

               <p>OCTOBER 5th. I WAS called-to the laſt boy's ſiſter, aged five years, who had been obſerved, only the day before, to complain of a dull pain in the throat. She had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately blooded, and had got a mixture of <hi>ſpt. minder.</hi> and <hi>theriac,</hi> with a bliſter to the neck. She had been in a conſtant ſweat ſince ſhe began to take the mixture. When I ſaw her ſhe had the dry ſhrill voice, and difficult breathing, with great motion of the ribs and <hi>ſcapulae.</hi> Her face was a little ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and red; deglutition eaſy. Her pulſe was quick, and of a proper degree of ſtrength. What ſhe expectorated ſeemed to be of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent nature. Her ſenſes were all in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate. Leeches were immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to her neck, and afterwards a warm fomentation, and the ſteams of warm water and vinegar: theſe appeared to give her ſome eaſe. At night ſhe ſeemed worſe, and could not ly long in one poſture. She was vomited with the <hi>ſyr. ſcillit.</hi> and threw up a great deal of groſs ropy defluxion. I tryed her with a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0218202600:17"/>mixture of camphire and nitre. The next day her pulſe was 152, and weaker. The <hi>amygdalae</hi> appeared a little ſwelled, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>mucus.</hi> She had a little difficulty of deglutition. Frequent reachings. She called often for drink, but drunk little at a time. Tongue white and furred. Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather quicker to-day, and often altered. Eat ſome ſpoonfuls of panada and wine. She was ordered an emollient injection, and garlick cataplaſms to her feet. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, all the ſymptoms were worſe. The injection had operated thrice. Breathing difficult and quicker. Great reſtleſsneſs and anxiety. Pulſe weaker and intermitted. She died in the evening, all her ſenſes being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, and having eat ſomewhat juſt before. What ſhe ſpit up appeared thin; but what came up, with the ſhort ſtiffled cough, was always thick and yellow, like matter.</p>
               <p>WHEN ſhe was opened by Mr <hi>Gibſon</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, we perceived the glands at the root of the tongue turgid, covered with <hi>mucus,</hi> and their excretories open. The <hi>amygdalae</hi> were larger than uſual; but neither they,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0218202600:18"/>nor the neighbouring parts, were inflamed. All about the <hi>glottis</hi> was covered with a tough viſcid <hi>mucus.</hi> When the <hi>trachea</hi> was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no inflammation appeared; but all its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior internal ſurface, particularly the back part, next the <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> was covered with a ſoft half-diſſolved-like-membrahe, detached from the ſubjacent parts, lying looſe like the blankets of a bed that has been lain in, and matter like <hi>pus</hi> on each ſide of it, and betwixt it and the membrane of the <hi>trachea.</hi> Some of the ſmall glands about the <hi>glottis</hi> were turgid. The farther down we ſearched, the more purulent matter we found; but no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane appeared here. When we came to where the <hi>trachea</hi> enters the lungs, by ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, we could force out thro' it a great deal of whitiſh glutinous liquid. The ſame matter appeared in all the ramifications of the lungs, and they ſeemed to be intirely full of it, as we could ſqueeze it our, mixed with a little blood, from the ſmalleſt diviſions of that canal. The ſubſtance of the lungs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared quite ſound. The internal coat of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0218202600:19"/>the ſtomach ſeemed, likewiſe, very ſoft, and covered with a great quantity of <hi>mucus.</hi>

               <p>JUANUARY 3d. I was called to a boy of ſeven years of age, at <hi>Muſſelburgh,</hi> who had gone about till this morning, but had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained for four days of a great difficulty in his breathing, and of a conſtant dull pain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head of the <hi>trachea,</hi> attended with a ſhrill voice. As his pulſe was quick, and his breathing difficult, the Surgeon had that morning taken twelve ounces of blood from him, and given him <hi>Gum. Ammon. Sal. C. C. gr.</hi> iv. When I ſaw him, at night, his pulſe was very frequent and weak, his breathing quick; ſtill a little pain about the head of the <hi>trachea;</hi> no inflammation to be ſeen in the <hi>fauces,</hi> and his urine depoſited an ouzy ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His voice was feeble, and the ſhrill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had gone off.

This, however, muſt certainly have been the caſe, as matter was actually found in the ſuperior parts of the <hi>trachea,</hi> as his lungs appeared otherwiſe ſound, and could not be the cauſe of his death; and as he had the ſame purulent ſediment in his urine, which I had obſerved in the former caſes, and which attends all collections of matter, in whatever part of the body they are contained. To our purpoſe, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that matter of a purulent kind, was found in the <hi>trachea.</hi>

               <p>A BOOKBINDER'S child, four years old, in this town, was ſeized with a cough and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0218202600:21"/>quick breathing, Saturday October 5th, 1763. As it appeared of the croupy kind, he was blooded with leeches that day, and bliſtered next day. After this he ſeemed better, and went coughing thro' the houſe that week. Sunday 13th, I firſt ſaw the child. The voice was rather more hoarſe than uſual in the croup; the pulſe very quick, and the breathing very laborious, with a little pain in the throat in ſwallowing. Dry ſhort cough. I ſuſpected that there was a conſiderable mixture of the <hi>angina</hi> with the croup here. Leeches were applied to the neck, with fomentation and ſteams. 14th, Breathing much better, and all the ſymptoms eaſier. 15th, All the ſymptoms worſe. Pulſe and breathing very quick.

               <p>OCTOBER 20th, 1763. A girl, aged four years, coughed a little, was out the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and, at night, the cough increaſed with hoarſeneſs. On the 22d, Mr <hi>Wood,</hi> the family-ſurgeon, by accident, ſaw her play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and obſerving her breathing laborious, and her pulſe quick, tho' ſhe was otherwiſe well, he blooded her. 23d, She was worſe, and had a bliſter applied to her throat and back, and got an injection. 24th, I ſaw her firſt; her breathing quick, and hoarſe; pulſe 180; urine with an ouzy ſediment; and was told, that ſhe had coughed up, what ſeemed to the family, pure matter. By her breathing, more of the ſame kind ſtill ſeemed to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. She eat and drank without any pain. To expel the matter, if poſſible, ſhe got a vomit of ſquills; but nothing came away. 25th, She was much in the ſame way; and I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome matter mixed with the <hi>ſaliva,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0218202600:23"/>that ſhe had coughed up. Breathing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding quick, and laborious. Ordered the ſteams of warm vinegar to be drawn into the lungs, on purpoſe to produce a fit of cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but it had no ſuch effect, and ſhe died in the evening.</p>
               <p>WHEN the <hi>trachea</hi> was opened, by Mr <hi>Wood,</hi> the whole internal ſurface was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a membrane for three inches down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from the <hi>glottis.</hi> This membrane was compleat all around, did not adhere to the <hi>trachea,</hi> and came off in the ſhape of a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tube. The natural coats of the <hi>trachea</hi> ſeemed entire, and not ulcered. The ſubſtance of the lungs was quite ſound; but the veſicles of the left lobe were filled with yellow thick <hi>pus,</hi> which ſunk in water. The new formed membrane had ſome degree of tenacity; and, when ſteeped in milk-warm water for two days, did not diſſolve, but preſerved ſome degree of coheſion. Mo fibres could be obſerved in it.</p>
               <p>THE preceeding facts excited the curioſity of ſome gentlemen, and have been confirmed

               <p>MR <hi>Wardrobe</hi> Surgeon related to me the the following caſe. A boy, eight years of age, and healthful, had been ill two days. His breathing was difficult; his voice was croupy; he was feveriſh, and had all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. He was blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bliſtered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all to no purpoſe; and died the fourth day.</p>
               <p>THE whole <hi>trachea,</hi> externally, appeared ſwelled, and rather oedematous than inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory. When he opened it, the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide was covered with a ſoft, thick, pale-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured membrane, which eaſily ſeparated from the parts below; thoſe had a ſlight degree of inflammation. When he purſued the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifications of the <hi>trachea</hi> thro' the lungs, there was found, there, a conſiderable quantity of real <hi>pus,</hi> which ſeemed to fill all thoſe pipes. The lungs themſelves were ſound. Nothing can be liker the former caſes than

               <head>CASE X.</head>
               <p>THE following caſe, in confirmation of the preceeding, was communicated to me by Mr <hi>Balfour</hi> Surgeon, and which I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in his own words. <hi>November</hi> 1ſt 1763, I was deſired to viſit a child, between two and three years old, living at the <hi>Canonmills.</hi> His face was fluſhed; his breathing laborious; his cough of the hard croupy kind; his pulſe was frequent; his tongue clean; with little drought, and no pain. I was informed by the parents, that the child had been very healthful; but for eight days paſt had been troubled with a cough, which did not put on the preſent appearance till the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was called; and that the child had, till that time, gone about, and eat his meat heartily. They had then applied leeches to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0218202600:26"/>his neck, which bled a great deal, and had with difficulty been ſtopt. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took away, from the jugular vein, two cupfulls of blood more, which was ſizy; and being informed, that he ſometimes reached, I ordered a vomit of <hi>tinct. ipecacuanh.</hi> with an addition of <hi>acet. ſcillit.</hi> which was given about an hour after he was blooded, and brought up a great deal of tenacious <hi>mucus.</hi> That night, he got a bliſter to his back, and the ſaline mixture every two hours. <hi>Nov.</hi> 2d, His Pulſe was as frequent, but not ſo firm. All the other ſymptoms rather worſe. He was ordered a decoction of the bark; the oily ſaline mixture, to be taken internally; and the camphorated volatile oil, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied externally. The child took two or three doſes of the decoction and mixture; but towards the evening, the ſymptoms grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe, the medicines were diſcontinued. The child died next morning.</p>
               <p>WHEN the <hi>trachea</hi> was laid open, I thought that a ſuppuration had happened; but, upon nearer inſpection, found, that it was only the <hi>mucus</hi> which had acquired a pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rulent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0218202600:27"/>colour; and that it was formed into a membranous cruſt, which every where lined the internal membrane of the <hi>trachea,</hi> from the <hi>larynx,</hi> to its entrance into the <hi>thorax.</hi> This preternatural membrane appeared thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt about the middle of the <hi>trachea;</hi> and, there, ſeemed almoſt to fill up the paſſage. It was ſo firm, that a conſiderable portion ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at once, leaving the natural membrane of the <hi>trachea</hi> bare and ſound, and with the appearance of a ſlight inflammation. I put a conſiderable portion of the preternatural membrane into water; and, after that, it ſtill retained a degree of tenacity, but had too little firmneſs to be preſerved.</p>

               <p>THE following caſe, which was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me by—, I think worth relating; as it ſhows the diſeaſe in a different ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from all the preceeding; indeed, under ſuch circumſtances, as I never had an opportunity to ſee, and muſt appear very ſeldom in, for it is the only one of its kind that I have heard of.</p>
               <p>MISS ******, about nine years old, was ſeized with a ſlight cough, on the 25th of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0218202600:29"/>
                  <hi>October,</hi> owing to rainy weather, and wet feet. On the 26th, when I ſaw her firſt, the ſcarcely had any heat, thirſt, or ſickneſs, and no pain of any kind, except when ſhe cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or was fretted, which bringing on a quick inſpiration, ſhe then felt ſome ſlight pain in the windpipe, a little below the <hi>rima glottidis.</hi> Her voice was ſhrill, like that of a young cock. She was blooded; got a gentle vomit; emolient cataplaſms to her feet; and a bliſter to her back. 27th, Symptoms no better. No difficulty of deglutition, and no redneſs to be ſeen in the throat. She never expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torated any thing like <hi>pus</hi> or phlegm, during the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. Steams of warm water were tried. 28th, Her cough was inceſſant for ſome hours, during which, ſhe coughed up a piece of a membrane. This I believed to be a part of what lines the <hi>trachea,</hi> as it had a mortified appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and was like black ſhagg ſilk. She died ſoon after this.</p>
               <p>UPON opening the body, the diſeaſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeated, ſolely, in the head of the <hi>trachea,</hi> as its membrane appeared to me mortified
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0218202600:30"/>two inches downwards. Below that, the <hi>trachea,</hi> and its branches, ſeemed quite ſound.</p>
               <p>IT was very natural for one, who had never any opportunity of ſeeing this diſeaſe in its natural ſituation, to think, that a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification had ſeized on the coats of the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea.</hi> But to one who has been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſpect bodies, in this diſeaſe, it muſt appear probable, that it was only the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and morbid membrane become black, which gave the <hi>trachea</hi> the appearance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortified. No wonder that the coats of the <hi>trachea</hi> were thought to be in a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſtate, when I imagined they had ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the firſt caſe, that I met with. The coughing up a piece of the membrane, ſhows that it was this looſely adhering one, and none of the natural ones, which are ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attached; and which, having no fleſhy parts below, could not have been ſo eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. This, then, appears to differ in no other point from the others, but only that here the morbid membrane had dryed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0218202600:31"/>and turned black; whereas, in all the former, it was moiſt and white.</p>
               <p>THESE are all the caſes, that I have kept an account of, or received from others. Tho' few, they are leading ones, and ſufficient to eſtabliſh many material facts and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that have hitherto been unknown, with regard to this diſeaſe. We will now draw, from them, ſome concluſions; which, as we have proceeded ſo cautiouſly, will be the more certain. If we add any reaſoning, to ſet theſe concluſions in a clearer light, we ſhall keep as cloſe as poſſible to ſettled experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſhall give it only as probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, finding fault with no perſon who may reaſon differently.</p>
               <p>COROLLARY I. It ſeems eaſy, in general, to diſtinguiſh the Croup from all other diſeaſes hitherto deſcribed. A peculiar ſharp ſhrill voice, not eaſily deſcribed; a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able freedom from all complaints, when in imminent danger, ſo that they will eat a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute before they expire; a quick laborious breathing; a frequent pulſe, ſometimes ſtrong at firſt, but always ſoft and weak to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0218202600:32"/>the end; ſcarce any difficulty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition, or remarkable inflammation in the <hi>fauces;</hi> a dull pain, often, and ſometimes an external ſwelling in the upper part of the <hi>trachea;</hi> ſenſes quite diſtinct to the laſt; and all the ſymptoms moſt rapid in their progreſs, characteriſe ſufficiently this diſeaſe. I have not mentioned a cough, as that ſymptom is ſometimes abſent; and when it attends the Croup, it is not of the common kind, but more ſhort and ſtiffled, and leſs convulſive, with little or no expectoration.</p>
               <p>THE other ſymptoms, that often attend it, ſuch as a red ſwelled face, oedematous feet, drought, urine ſometimes with, and, at other times, without a ſediment, reachings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not ſo conſtant as the former; and therefore, are not ſo characteriſtical.</p>
               <p>THOSE not converſant in this diſeaſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten miſtake peripneumoniacal complaints, and ſevere colds, for it; and, as they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure theſe, they are apt to look on it as not ſo dangerous. But we have ſeen, that the lungs are totally free from any inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and are not the ſeat of the diſeaſe.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0218202600:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>The <hi>Catarrhus ſuffocativus</hi> of <hi>Etmuller</hi> ſeems, likewiſe, to have been a peripneumony. And, as he deſcribes no peculiarity in the voice; as the ſymptoms ſeem to have been, apparently, ſeverer; and as it returned, at ſtated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular periods, we muſt conſider them as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſeaſes, tho' ſimilar in many points.</p>
               <p>As this diſeaſe has different vulgar names, for I am told, that on the weſt coaſt, they call it the <hi>Chock,</hi> or <hi>Stuffing,</hi> a technical one becomes abſolutely neceſſary. A name is beſt given from the apparent ſymptoms, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſpicuous, while the cauſe is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hidden, and often doubtful. The lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptoms here, are, the ſhrill voice, and difficult breathing.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0218202600:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſmall-pox; for long catarrhs from the ſmall pox, meaſles, or chin-cough, are ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſponent cauſes to this diſeaſe. The moiſt and cold weather in winter, ſeems to have great power in producing this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>COROL. III. Very different have been the opinions, with regard to the ſeat of the <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focatio ſtridula.</hi> Some placing it in the <hi>glot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> and its muſcles; ſome in the coats of the <hi>trachea;</hi> while others have fixt its ſeat in the lungs themſelves. None of all theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appear to be true. The <hi>glottis</hi> is never found contracted or inflamed; the lungs are quite ſound; and the coats of the <hi>tracked</hi> ſeem to ſuffer only by ſecond hand.</p>
               <p>THE ſeat of this diſtemper appears to be the cavity of the wind-pipe. The place firſt, and moſt particularly, affected, is the upper part of the <hi>trachea,</hi> about an inch below the <hi>glottis;</hi> for in that part they complain of a dull pain; the external ſwelling has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved there; and the morbid membrane we have found ſtretching from that place down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The back part of the <hi>trachea,</hi> where there are no cartilages, ſeems, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0218202600:37"/>ſpection of thoſe that die of this diſeaſe, to be its firſt and principal ſeat, as this morbid membrane is often found there, when it is in no other part.</p>
               <p>No wonder that the morbid appearances are chiefly found there; for, there, are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt number of glands, deſigned for the ſecretion of <hi>mucus.</hi> This fluid is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from glandular bodies, depoſited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the different membranes, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated by an infinite number of almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible ſmall holes, that give a paſſage to the excretory ducts of theſe glands. The largeſt of theſe lye on the outer, and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſurface of that membrane, which ſerves, on the back part, to make up the deficiency of the cartilages, as they are not compleat circles.</p>
               <p>IN ſome of the former caſes, the whole glands, at the root of the tongue, and the <hi>amygdalae</hi> were turgid, and the parts covered with <hi>mucus.</hi> In the mucous glands, in general, this diſtemper ought to be conſidered, as ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally ſeated; but, from particular cauſes, more directed to thoſe of the <hi>trachea;</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0218202600:38"/>where, from the nature of the part, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes viſible in a different ſhape.</p>
               <p>COROL. IV. Various have been the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oretical opinions of people, who never had the opportunity, or gave themſelves the trouble, to ſearch into the real cauſe of this diſtemper. Some have attributed it to ſpaſms of the muſcles, that contract the <hi>glottis.</hi> That it was not occaſioned by ſpaſms of the muſcles, that contract the <hi>larynx,</hi> might have appeared from the ſymptoms them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Had this been of the claſs of ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic nervous diſeaſes, it would have come in paroxyſms, with remiſſion and exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the urine would always have been pale; convulſions would have come on before death; and antiſpaſmodics, inſtead of evacuants, would have been the remedies.</p>
               <p>HAD theſe muſcles, or any of the coats of the <hi>trachea,</hi> been inflamed or mortified, as others have thought, the pain would have been greater than it is, before the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the pulſe would have been ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than it generally is, as the parts are membranous.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0218202600:39"/>
               <p>IF, according to the opinion of many, the lungs had been inflamed and ſuppurated; the cough would have been more inceſſant and violent; the pulſe full and ſoft; with a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of weight in the breaſt, ſizy blood, dry tongue, and delirium.</p>
               <p>BUT all theſe fanciful erroneous opinions fall to the ground, when we once inſpect the morbid body. From that true ſource of knowledge, we learn, that the cauſe of this diſeaſe is a preternatural white, tough, thick membranous cruſt, covering, often for many inches, the inſide of the <hi>trachea.</hi> This mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is of ſo tenacious a conſiſtence, that it can remain ſoaking in warm water, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days, without diſſolving. It is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the parts below, but is eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from them, as there is always mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behind it. When it ends, the <hi>trachea</hi> is covered with good <hi>pus,</hi> or purulent <hi>mucus;</hi> as are, generally, the ramifications of the <hi>bronchiae</hi> and veſicles, which, in ſome caſes, were quite filled with it. To account how this matter, as there is no ulceration; and how this membrane are formed, we muſt trace things from their ſource.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0218202600:40"/>
               <p>THE blood conſiſts of three principal parts, the <hi>craſſamentum, ſerum,</hi> and <hi>lymph;</hi> the laſt of which is a diaphanous liquor, full of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinous and nutritious particles. This liquor very ſimilar to the white of an egg, is coagulable by heat, alkohol, acids, and by every method which attracts or evaporates the watery particles. This coagulable part, probably, is the nutritious part of our blood.</p>
               <p>THIS gelatinous lymph abounds more in young animals, than in thoſe come to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Geoffroy le Cadet,</hi> in the <hi>Mem. Acad. des Sciences,</hi> for the year 1730, by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments ſhows us this fact; and makes it appear, that there is twice as much nutritive jelly in veal, as in beef. The final reaſon for this is ſelf-evident; for young creatures, on account of their growing, require a greater ſupply of nouriſhment. Children muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, abound more with it than men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>mucus</hi> ſeparated from glands, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of the body, <hi>viz.</hi> noſe, <hi>fauces, oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus,</hi> ſtomach, guts, <hi>trachea,</hi> and <hi>bronchiae,</hi> appears to be very analogous to this lymph.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0218202600:41"/>The former differs from the latter, only, in its greater ſpiſſitude; and this alteration is brought about after its ſecretion, the more watery parts being volatilized and diſſipated, while the more heavy and viſcous remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. This <hi>mucus</hi> is extremely diſpoſed to inſpiſſation, as appears from experiments. Even the admiſſion of cold air into the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea</hi> thickens this <hi>mucus,</hi> often, to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it ſtagnates in the glands, and all ſecretion is entirely ſtopt.</p>
               <p>IN children, as well as in old people, this ſecretion is plentiful, owing to the great quantity of it they contain, and to the laxity of their veſſels. This evacuation is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly increaſed during the cold and moiſt weather of winter, when the perſpiration is diminiſhed, and the glandular ſecretions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>THIS evacuation is promoted by all ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulants, operating on the <hi>trachea</hi> and lungs, as we obſerve from the effects of ſnuff, and the ſmoak of tobacco. The maritime air ſupplies a <hi>ſtimulus,</hi> calculated to increaſe the ſecretion from the <hi>mucus</hi> glands of the <hi>trachea</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0218202600:42"/>and lungs. Along with the moiſture, ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſea by the winds, is carried likewiſe, a great quantity of ſea-ſalt; as every thing, at ſome diſtance from the ſhore, taſtes ſalt. This inſpired into the lungs, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the orifices of the tracheal glands, and increaſes the mucous ſecretion. This effect will happen more particularly in children, as their nerves are more irritable, than thoſe of people advanced in years. Hence we find, that, in moiſt winter weather, particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſea-ſhore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> children ſhould have an unuſual ſecretion of <hi>mucus,</hi> from the glands of the wind-pipe. Diſeaſes, ſuch as the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, meaſles, chin-cough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes, have the ſame effect in increaſing this diſcharge. When theſe are combined, there exiſts the greateſt prediſpoſition to this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>WHEN there happens a very great ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this coagulate fluid from the glands of the <hi>trachea</hi> in children, they are either not ſufficiently attentive, or often too young, to ſpit it up. The thinner parts are carried off during expiration, while the remainder is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0218202600:43"/>thickened and compreſſed, by the obſtruction, that the narrowneſs of the <hi>glottis</hi> muſt make to the exit of the air from a larger canal. Every circumſtance encourages its concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a ſolid firm membrane, while the more internal parts of the <hi>mucus,</hi> continuing ſtill fluid, and the continual ſecretion of more, keep it ſeparated from the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>BUT how happens it that we find pure matter, which ſinks in water, behind the membrane, and in the different ramifications of the <hi>trachea,</hi> when there is no ulceration? Matter does not seem to be formed, as was generally thought, by the veſſels of the ulcer; but to exiſt in the blood, particularly in the ſerous and lymphatic liquors, nearly in the fame ſtate; and to be, probably, the true nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trititious, nay, perhaps, the coagulable part of our fluids. Dr <hi>Pringle,</hi> in his ingenious, uſeful, and accurate experiments, upon ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and antiſeptic ſubſtances, found, that the <hi>ſerum,</hi> when ſtagnating, and expoſed to heat, let fall a white ſubstance like <hi>pus;</hi> and, from thence, juſtly, concludes, that the <hi>pus</hi> of ulcers is formed, in the ſame way, by the evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0218202600:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the more watery particles, and the ſubſiding and inſpiſſation of this part. This fluid ſhows a great tendency to become ſolid, by reſtoring quickly all loſs of ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>THERE cannot be a fitter ſituation, for the formation of <hi>pus</hi> from the mucous ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the <hi>trachea</hi> and lungs. There the ſame ſecretion, evaporation, ſtagnation, and heat exiſts, as in an ulcer; and, therefore, the ſame conſequence ſhould, and does, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. We often ſee real <hi>pus</hi> ſpit up in the end of a cold. Perhaps this change from <hi>mucus</hi> to <hi>pus,</hi> happens before the membrane is formed, as <hi>pus</hi> ſhows ſuch a tendency to aſſume a ſolid form, and is deſigned by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to repair all deficiencies in the ſolids.</p>
               <p>THIS diſeaſe now appears of a very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature, and unlike any other that we know. <hi>Du Haen</hi> has, indeed, lately told us, that he has ſometimes found, in diſſection, the <hi>viſcera</hi> covered, externally, with a white tough cruſt. I wiſh he had given us the hiſtory of ſome of theſe patients. He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that it was formed from the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory cruſt in the blood; but, here, these never is found any.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0218202600:45"/>
               <p>I HAVE lately met with a deſcription in the Philoſophical Tranſactions abridged, Vol. 3d, page 68th, of a membrane formed in the inſide of the <hi>trachea.</hi>" <q rend="margDblQuotes">"A boy five years old, died of a consumption. A year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, he was troubled with a dry cough, which continued ever after, ſpitting, now and then, a little quantity of blood. Ten or twelve days before he died, his nurse took notice of ſome thick ſkins he ſpit up. His Phyſcian, having exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one of them, ſound, it had the ſhape and conſiſtence of a veſſel, which made him think it might perhaps be ſome veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the lungs. The child being dead, I opened the body. In the left ſide of the lungs, I found a little purulent <hi>ſanies.</hi> The inſide of the <hi>trachea</hi> was incruſtated with a ſlimy membrane, which I took off from the <hi>trachea,</hi> and the branches in the lungs, inſomuch that that <hi>pellicula</hi> made a perfect veſſel, from the <hi>larynx</hi> to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extremities of the <hi>bronchiae,</hi> from which it came off very eaſily, without breaking ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the trunk, or the branches. It adhered
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0218202600:46"/>to the inward coat of the <hi>trachea,</hi> only by ſome ſmall filaments, which were ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they broke off easily; and made me think, the production of that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary veſſel was nothing but the mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous humour, continually diſcharged by the glands of the <hi>trachea,</hi> grown more clammy by the diſtemper, and ſo dry that it could not be ſpit out; this incruſting the inſide of the <hi>trachea</hi> and <hi>bronchiae,</hi> and growing thicker, was at laſt ſhaven off by the violent fit of coughing the child was ſometimes taken with, and then was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again by the ſucceeding <hi>mucus.</hi> This new veſſel would not diſſolve in hot water. The veſſels of the lungs, that is the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea</hi> and <hi>bronchiae,</hi> the pulmonary arteries and veins, were as whole as could be."</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT appears, by the diſſection, that there was no impoſthume formed in the lungs; and that the child died from this preternatural membrane. Perhaps, many of the <hi>polypus</hi>'s, thrown up from the bronchial veſſels of grown up people, might have the ſame origin.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0218202600:47"/>Theſe caſes ſhow, how apt the <hi>mucus</hi> is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſolid form.</p>
               <p>WE have an account, in the Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tranſactions abridged, vol. 2d, of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> called the <hi>morbus ſtrangula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> which, from the puſtles, <hi>petechiae;</hi> and putrid diſpoſition of the fluids, appears more nearly allied to the malignant ſore throat, altho' it ſometimes attacked the <hi>aſpera arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> A case is, there, related, where a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low membranous coat, of the ſhape of the <hi>trachea</hi> and its branches, was coughed up, and ſuppoſed to be the natural membrane of theſe parts. Another ſimilar to the former came up afterwards. The patient lived about a day after this.</p>
               <p>COROL. V. There appears, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding facts, two very different ſituations of the <hi>Suffocatio ſtridula;</hi> the former more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory, and leſs dangerous; the latter leſs inflammatory, and highly dangerous. In the former, the pulſe is generally ſtrong; the face red; drought great; and they agree with evacuations: In the latter, the pulſe is very quick, and ſoft; great weakneſs; tongue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0218202600:48"/>moiſt; leſs drought; great anxiety; and evacuations haſten death. The former may be called the inflammatory; and the latter, the purulent ſtate.</p>
               <p>THESE are two very different ſtages of the diſtemper, and muſt be carefully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the practitioner, that he may know how to direct his applications; or, at leaſt, how to form a juſt <hi>prognoſis;</hi> as he is, generally, not called till the patient is in the latter ſtage. If this diſeaſe comes on with an old habitual cough, or by ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the inflammatory ſtage will ſcarcely be perceivable.</p>
               <p>IF the pulſe is very ſoft and feeble, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after being ſtrong; or any purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes up with ſpitting, vomiting, or coughing, which happened in ſome of the former caſes, we have a proof that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent ſtate is, already, formed. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught me another mark, by which I can diſtinguiſh these different ſtates. I have obſerved, that the urine, which, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inflammatory ſtate, is thin, had always, after the purulent ſtate came on, a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0218202600:49"/>light ouzy purulent ſediment, ſuch as people have from matter collected any where, that has no vent outwards.</p>
               <p>NO wonder, that the matter is ſpeedily abſorbed, in this ſituation, as it is contained in the <hi>bronchiae</hi> and veſicles, and of courſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by the whole internal ſurface of the lungs and <hi>trachea;</hi> a ſurface infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any impoſthume can have. Hence the blood will be ſuddenly filled with it; and the urine have that white purulent ſediment, which ariſes from abſorption of matter.</p>
               <p>IN the latter ſtage, we find the membrane compleatly formed. Is it ſo in the former? I ſuſpect that it has not yet got a firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency; otherwiſe evacuations would not have ſo ſudden and ſalutary an effect, as they produce in this ſtage. Perhaps, the turgid and inflamed glands are but yet expelling the thick <hi>mucus,</hi> which is circulating thro' the veſſels in too great a quantity, and in too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſſated a ſtate. This is ſtrongly confirmed by the great quantity of <hi>mucus,</hi> ſound in the ſtomach, and the ſwelling of the mucous glands at the root of the tongue. Even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0218202600:50"/>death we perceive ſome degree of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the coais of the <hi>trachea,</hi> which probably has been greater at the beginning, when the flux of humour commeneed, and the irritation was ſtronger.</p>
               <p>COROL. VI. It seems to be no very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter to account, from the cauſe, for all the ſymptoms of this diſeaſe. A ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the <hi>trachea,</hi> and dryneſs of the parts, will mechanically alter the voice, and make it more ſhrill; for we find in all wind inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the notes are acute in proportion to the smallneſs of the bore. Mr <hi>Balfour</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon told me, that he attended a child in a disease, which, from the ſimilarity of voice, appeared to him the Croup. The child died. When opened, a piece of ſhell, which the child had ſucked in with it's breath, was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acroſs the <hi>trachea,</hi> about an inch below the <hi>glottis,</hi> and the membrane was infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and dry. Here was an artificial Croup raiſed, from which we may evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the voice is altered in the natural diſeaſe.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0218202600:51"/>
               <p>WHEN there appears to be a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>mucus</hi> circulating in the veſſels; when there is, often, ſo much <hi>mucus</hi> or <hi>pus</hi> in all the pipes of the lungs; when there is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural membrane formed in the <hi>trachea;</hi> no wonder that Nature excites a fever, her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and conſtant reſource, when ſhe is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently attacked and in danger.</p>
               <p>CONSIDERING the acuteneſs of the fever; conſidering the obſtruction in the <hi>trachea, bronchiae,</hi> and veſicles; with what difficulty the air muſt gain admiſſion to diſtend them; and what hindrance that muſt give the blood circulating through the lungs; a laborious breathing muſt, neceſſarily, attend the other ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>AS the blood paſſes with ſome difficulty thro' the lungs, an unuſual weakneſs muſt certainly come on, the face become ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the extremities appear oedematous.</p>
               <p>TO account for that total want of pain, or ſo ſlight a one that they don't attend to it, unleſs when aſked, is a matter of ſome difficulty. That the membrane of the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, in general ſo very irritable from every
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0218202600:52"/>ſlight cauſe, ſhould calmly bear the preſence of ſuch a quantity of matter, and of ſo thick a membrane, is not the leaſt ſurprizing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of this uncommon diſtemper. The <hi>mucus</hi> being a humour natural to theſe parts; its ſlow and gradual collection and inſpiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; freſh <hi>mucus</hi> conſtantly ſeparated, which hinder the membrane from hurting the <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi> unleſs in motions of the neck; theſe reaſons may account, in part, for the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of that natural irritability, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in theſe places. But they do not ſatisfy me altogether. We cannot expect to have all our doubts removed.</p>
               <p>COROL. VII. This diſeaſe appears, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to be a very dangerous one, and the more ſo, as it is ſilent in its progreſs, and gives no viſible alarm, till death is near at hand. The firſt ſtage of this diſtemper, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, paſſes unobſerved; and, before we ſee it, is beyond all remedy. As it happens, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to young children, who are unable to ſpeak or deſcribe their feelings, we have double reaſon to be afraid.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0218202600:53"/>
               <p>IF we be not called till the third or fourth day; if the breathing appears much affected, the pulſe quick and weak, the face red, great anx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ety, and frequent toſſing, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is great and preſſing. But if we ſee the patient the firſt or ſecond day of the attack; if the breathing is not very bad; the pulſe, though frequent, ſtrong, and firm; and more eſpecially, if the voice is only altered, in its ſtronger exertions of crying or cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but more natural in its common ſtate, we may entertain hopes of a recovery. The firſt ſign commonly of ſafety, is the cough becoming ſtronger and leſs dry, with that peculiar ſound which attends moiſtened lungs; for this ſhows that the membrane is not formed, or is already diſſolved, and that the inflammatory ſtate is abated.</p>
               <p>THE caſe ſeems very deſperate, when the membrane is once formed, and the lungs filled with matter. In the latter caſe, the patient is ſoon ſuffocated, as effectually, tho' more ſlowly, as if he was immerſed over the head in it.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0218202600:54"/>
               <p>IT appears, from the preceeding caſes, that the membrane, alone, is ſufficient to kill, as there was but little matter found in the lungs of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>DESPERATE as the caſe is, the patient's recovery is, perhaps, not altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Nature, by the means of a critical cough, may eject the membrane and matter; though, indeed, the ſenſation of theſe parts, by which it muſt effectuate this, ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt altogether deſtroyed. If that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the patient would recover, as the lungs are quite ſound.</p>
               <p>IN one of the former caſes, part of the membrane was thrown up, but the patient died. I was told by Mr <hi>Gibſon</hi> ſurgeon, that a patient of his eſcaped, after throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a great quantity of matter, and coughing up large pieces of a membrane.</p>
               <p>THE following curious caſe was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me, lately, by Mr <hi>Rae</hi> ſurgeon. A boy betwixt five and ſix years of age, was ſeized, Auguſt 5th, 1764, with a ſlight cold and hoarſeneſs. On the 8th, had a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing, the ſhrill voice, and a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0218202600:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>little fever. As the boy was in a natural ſweat, he ordered a mixture with <hi>Spt. Minder.</hi> 9th, Pulſe quicker, and no expectoration. Was blooded, got an injection, and had a bliſter applied to his throat. 11th, This morning he was told, that, after a ſevere fit of cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a membrane-like ſubſtance, about two inches long, pretty tough, and reſembling a piece of thin white leather, had been thrown out. In the evening, ſome <hi>pus</hi> was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the phlegm expectorated up, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſhable from it. The boy did not recover his voice for three months.</p>
               <p>ART, though not in the way of internal medicine, may attempt effectuating the ſame end.</p>
               <p>COROL. VIII. We have had occaſion to ſee, in the preceeding caſes, great variety of different applications, and their good or bad ſucceſs. Let us deduce ſome general rules with regard to practice. In the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſtate, bleeding appears to have been attended with immediate good effects, and to be a powerful remedy in this ſituation. This ought to be done expeditiouſly and plentifully, while the pulſe will allow it. It
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0218202600:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>is beſt to take blood at firſt, with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, ſo that a ſufficient quantity may ſoon b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> drawn off; and, afterwards, by leeches, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the upper and fore part of the throat. Their orifices, when kept open by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of warm wet-cloths, will allow the blood to onze from them for many hours.</p>
               <p>IT ſeems neceſſary to keep the patient's belly conſtantly looſe, by ſuch medicines as children will take; for we ought to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentive not to ſet them a-crying, as that may ſuddenly ſuffocate the child. For this purpoſe, I generally uſe tablets of <hi>magneſia alba,</hi> made palatable with ſugar. Some of the cooling reſolvent ſalts, ſuch as the chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaliſed <hi>ſal polychreſt,</hi> diſſolved in whey, will be of ſervice, provided the patient will peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably take them.</p>
               <p>BLISTERS; applied round the neck, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the veſſels are well emptied, do great ſervice. They ſeem to do none, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied before this time; nay, if the ſtate is very inflammatory, muſt do much hurt, from their violent <hi>ſtimulus</hi> on the veſſels. Emollient fomentations and cataplaſms, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0218202600:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>round the neck, are of conſiderable uſe, and keep up a local evacuation.</p>
               <p>THESE evacuations operate in ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways, <hi>viz.</hi> by thinning the denſe <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> while yet circulating in the blood; by diverting its flux from the parts affected, as there is a great communication and conſent betwixt the different <hi>mucous</hi> glands thro' the body; but, particularly, by increaſing the abſorbent power of the veſſels on emptying them; by which means the purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be ſucked in from the lungs. It was found in the urine of one of the foregoing convaleſcent patients.</p>
               <p>THE reſolvent and gently ſtimulating ſteams of warm water and vinegar, drawn in with the breath, ſeemed always to have an immediate good effect. Is it from diſſolving the thick <hi>mucus,</hi> and ſo oppoſing its concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? That is probably the caſe, as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient always ſpits a great deal after it, and the lungs appear moiſter.</p>
               <p>VOMITS are, frequently, given in this ſtage of the diſeaſe. They are, generally, thought to be of uſe; but I never ſaw any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0218202600:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>advantage ariſing from them. I rather ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that they muſt be often pernicious, as they increaſe the ſecretion of <hi>mucus</hi> in the lungs, without expelling it, which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſtance that, if poſſible, we ought, to guard againſt. The evacuation that they make otherways is but ſmall.</p>
               <p>GENTLE ſudorifics may be of ſervice, as they divert the flux from the more internal parts to the external. Others think that theſe are of uſe; and preſcribe the <hi>Vin. emet.</hi> in ſmall quantities. I cannot ſay that I ever ſaw any great advantage from them.</p>
               <p>BUT when the membrane is once form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the purulent matter, in great quantity, collected in the lungs, evacuations can be no longer of any uſe; they rather hurt, as the pulſe is then weak. Hence the reaſon, why people differ about the effects of evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in this diſeaſe; ſome deeming them the only certain remedy, while others hold them to be deſtructive. Both have built their opinion on fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts and obſervation. But as their applications were made in different ſtages of the diſtemper, the effects behoved
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0218202600:59"/>to be different. What was the only remedy in the inflammatory ſtate, muſt appear hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the purulent.</p>
               <p>IN this ſtate of purulency we plainly ſee, that nothing can do ſervice, but what brings up the matter from the lungs, and that ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily too. And pray what medicines can do this? Vomits only evacuate, immediately, the ſtomach; but by means of the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the nerves, they often bring on a coughing, during their action. They might be of ſervice, if they had this ſalutary effect; but I never ſaw them anſwer this purpoſe, though often given with that deſign. The nerves are, indeed, ſo unactive, that we can entertain no reaſonable hopes from this quarter.</p>
               <p>SHALL we endeavour to excite a cough, by the means of effluvia, or ſteams inſpired into the lungs? That has been tried, to no purpoſe; for the membrane which covers the <hi>trachea,</hi> and the <hi>mucus</hi> or matter which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the lungs, render theſe parts inſenſible to any external irritation.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0218202600:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>To effectuate a ſolution of the morbid membrane, after it is once completely formed and conſolidated, ſeems to me impoſſible by any internal or external medicine that I know. To effectuate its expulſion appears equally impoſſible. We have, then, no method re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to ſave the patient's life, but that of extraction. That cannot be done thro' the <hi>glottis.</hi> When the caſe is deſperate, may we not try <hi>bronchotomy?</hi> I can ſee no weighty objection to that operation, as the membrane can be ſo eaſily got at, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry looſe. Many a more hazardous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is daily performed. I would propoſe, however, that it ſhould be firſt tried on a dead ſubject, that we may proceed with all manner of caution and aſſiſtance. But ſomething ought to be tried in this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſituation.</p>
               <p>WE have now brought our Inquiry to a concluſion. The facts, we hope, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear curious, exact, and ſufficiently nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for our purpoſe; the method ſuch as as is uſed in mathematics and natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, for diſcovering unknown truths; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0218202600:61"/>the concluſions new, ſurpriſing, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſing from the facts. If we have not brought this Inquiry to that degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in every point, that we could have wiſhed, we have the ſatisfaction, at leaſt, to think, that, ſo far as we go, our diſcoveries are certain, as they are built on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Nature. Shunning, with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable care, fruitleſs and deceitful ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, however entertaining, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept our facts and experiments in view, as the only road to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of medicine, and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
