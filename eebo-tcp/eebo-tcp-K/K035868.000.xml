            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My Queſtions may be blunt, but you are not bound to Anſwer them, but let that be as you like 'em.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Pray who do you reckon is the Author of this Deviliſh Book, call'd, <hi>The Shorteſt Way?</hi>

               <p>Do you think my Name is Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> that you take me for <hi>an Informer?</hi> read the <hi>Gazett,</hi> there you have the Man with the <hi>Sharp Chin,</hi> and a <hi>Dutch Noſe.</hi>

               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but Sir, we begin to doubt that is not the true Author, that he has been only made the Tool of ſome other party, who now they find the World Exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at it, have ſlipt out of the Nooſe, and left him in it; we begin to be afraid the thing is a Reality, and there is ſuch a deſign on foot.</p>

               <p n="1">1. If you are not ſure he is the Author, you <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> have done him a great deal of wrong, for you have rail'd at him more than all the reſt of the World, and charg'd him with more Crimes than 'tis well poſſible for one Man to be Guilty of.</p>

               <p>Sir your Humble Servant; no <hi>Bellamy, I</hi> tell you not <hi>I</hi> Sir; If I were in a Plot with the Devil, I'le never turn Evidence, beſides Sir, <hi>I</hi> have no mind to have my Noſe and Chin deſcrib'd, but if you pleaſe I'le Anſwer you Negatively, who I believe are not concern'd in it.</p>

               <p>No Sir, nor for Poſitives neither, if I can help it; but you have had your will at Catechiſing, and I ought to have my turn, let me ask you a few Queſtions too.</p>

               <p>If he expos'd you for <hi>Occaſional Conformity,</hi> 'tis what you ought to have rectifi'd your ſelves, that you need not have been expos'd for it; and in that he was your Friend; for had you took the hint and exploded the Practice, there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it.</p>

if that were ſo, 'twould make their Enemies at Peace with them, they'd never be Perſecuted; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would Cheriſh them, and be as tender of them as they would deſire.

               <p>There are a ſort of People among the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> who can either Diſſent or Conform, as they find their Inclinations or Intereſt rather directs them, theſe by their Wealth and Intereſt have always put themſelves into good places, and qualifi'd themſelves for that purpoſe, by taking the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: of theſe People, even the moſt moderate <hi>Church Men</hi> have an ill Opinion, and truly ſo have Two Thirds of your own Friends, for it looks as if they were Men of no Principles at all.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe Men the Act againſt <hi>Occaſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> is principally deſign'd, and if there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the Bill, I believe no good Man would be againſt it.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe things, Two ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been very groſly miſtaken, and upon their Miſtakes have proceeded to Act very Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly.</p>

               <p>You are the next ſort of People, who are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for being Naturally a little Hypiſh, as the Beaus call it, troubled with the Spleen, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack Vapours, this Cloud of Raillery ſo dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd your Underſtanding, that you preſently take

theſe People and the QUEEN, theſe People and the Government, theſe People and the Parliament, to be all of a mind; and the QUEEN having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac't all your Friends, as 'tis but juſt, <hi>That all Princes ſhould employ who they pleaſe:</hi> And the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment falling on your <hi>Occaſional Conformers,</hi> and this Book of <hi>the Shortest way</hi> coming out, altogether the high Church Party Thundred at you from the Preſs and the Pulpit: Away you run with the Notion that you are all to be blown up, that all theſe Things aim'd at your Deſtruction, and that Fire and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got was at the door.</p>
               <p>But the Government is ſteady, and the QUEEN ſtill has maintained her Motto, the Parliament ſteers in the middle way, going about to reſtrain, but not to deſtroy you; and taking no notice either of the heat of one party, or Folly of the other, they hold the Ballance of your Liberty between your own exorbitant Licenſe, and the other party's unchriſtian Fury; and in my opinion, thus far are you ſafe.</p>

               <p>The Author of <hi>the Shortest way</hi> comes with a Lanthorn for you, and he ſumms up all the black Things this high Party had publiſh'd, into one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and if you had any Eyes, you might learn two Things from him, <hi>where he is like topay dear enough for teaching you.</hi>
