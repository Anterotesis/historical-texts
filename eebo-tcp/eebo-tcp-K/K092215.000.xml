            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following pages are the firſt efforts of a youthful mind, and was wrote purely for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's amuſement, and now firſt collected and reviſed, (with ſuch alterations, additions, and improvements, as he thought
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0587800400:5"/>
neceſſary to make,) at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular requeſt of the young Lady, to whom the book is addreſſed; though he thinks it but juſtice to inform the readers, that many of the articles contained in this work, he has at different times inſerted in Magazines and other periodical publications; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly what he then called, Remarks on the Principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers; but as they were too precipitately written, he has wrote the following Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on a more judicious and extenſive plan, by ſelecting what uſeful matter he thought neceſſary from the former, and having interſperſed it with what he has now written, by which,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0587800400:6"/>
he flatters himſelf, this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, (trifling as he is ſenſible it muſt appear) wlll be thought far ſuperior to the former; as he has given an account of all the Principal Performers that have appeared at either of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres from the time he formerly ſet out to the preſent Period. He has likewiſe added a CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLUSION, wherein the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Demerits of moſt of the inferior Performers are ſet forth. Therefore, after ſaying thus much, he has nothing more to plead to his courteous Readers, (nor to judge Criticiſm, and his critical Court of Inqueſt) than by declaring his ſole Motive for giving Birth to this Production,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0587800400:7"/>
was entirely to oblige the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid young Lady; with that View he humbly ſubmits it to Peruſal of the indulgent Public; at the ſame time hoping, the ſew auxiliary Forces he has been obliged to call in from other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, will be deemed Venial, and with humble Dependence on Candour and generous Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, he launches his little Pinnance, trembling from the Shore.</p>

So many pens of almoſt all ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations in literature, for theſe thirty years paſt, have been employed in treating of Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> both as an actor and a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that I muſt confeſs I find it a difficult taſk to collect untouched materials; as ſuch I ſhall not at this time preſume to enter into the merit, or demerit, of this firſt-rate ornament of the Britiſh Stage, for fear I ſhould become a vile encroacher, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently make uſe of another man's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty as my own: therefore, in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void as much as poſſible this obſervation, I ſhall only give my courteous readers a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his perſon; though at the ſame time, I muſt beg leave to interſperſe a little borowed matter, in order to ſpeak of him with more preciſion than I probably might without theſe materials. But to his perſon, Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> though low in ſtature, is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly made, and well proportioned; his face is ſtrongly and finely featured, but on the whole not handſome; and yet, much leſs cannot be ſaid to the contrary. His eyes have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0587800400:26"/>
been ever and univerſally admired; their cut is what a painter would call bold and perfect, their ſize is big, the pupil large, ſtrong, lively, active, and variable; their colour dark, ſurrounded and ſet off with a due proportion of white, that gives to their every motion, a brilliancy, a diſtinctneſs, a life that ſpeaks in every glance. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion is dark; and laſtly his voice, which, from its harmony, ſweetneſs, and moreover from it's pliancy, and extenſive variety, has ever been admired. Having given a brief and juſt account of Mr. <hi>Garrick's</hi> perſon, I ſhall proceed to relate the names of ſome of the moſt celebrated characters this great actor ſhines in; without attempting to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his excellence in any particular, for fear I ſhould ſuffer for my preſumption, and run my account of this gentleman into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity of uſeleſs and unmeaning matter; as ſuch my intention is to touch upon Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> (as well as the following performers in general) in as true and conciſe manner as poſſible. But I ſhall proceed to relate a few
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0587800400:27"/>
of the various parts he is moſt eminent in; which in tragedy are Macbeth, Lear, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, Hamlet, Luſignan, Dorilas, &amp;c. &amp;c.

Were I capable of communicating to the reader, the names of all the various charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> excels in, and likewiſe to point out his excellence in each particular part, it problably might ſwell to the ſize of a large volume; they are indeed ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to leave ſufficient room for me to make this remark; that in ſhort, the moſt explicit and accurate manner I can find in ſumming up this gentleman's character as an actor, is by the following lines.</p>

                  <p>Mr. SMITH is a very pleaſing and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious actor; and in the parts of the unaffected well-bred gentleman, he irreproachably claims the foremoſt rank on the ſtage, for uniform elegance, eaſe, and ſuitable viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. His perſon is likewiſe one of the genteeleſt that I know; and his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment admirably polite and affable. What a pity it is, that this actor ſhould ſo often miſtake his abilities, by ſtraying out of that road which nature has ſo happily placed him in; did he retain leſs thoughts of his unfavourable muſe Melpomene, and confine himſelf more to his beſt friend Thalia, I would inſure his ſucceſs to be much greater than it is, as not one upon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0587800400:29"/>
the ſtage would have a chance to equal him in his walk: not but I muſt allow Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> to have many capital requiſites for a trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, but he is apt to wade out of his depth; and were it not for his agility and good ſenſe, I am perſuaded he would ſometimes be in danger of drowning: wherefore I greatly prefer in him the comedian to the tragedian; he is more ſelf-bred, and has a greater variety in the former than in the latter; in tragedy he has too much levity, and wants expreſſion, and his voice though clear and ſonorous, wants variation; as he ſcarce ever ſpeaks but in one continual tone: yet he poſſeſſes great fervour and manly ſpirit; particularly in his Richard, his Alexander, and the like; his Jachimo, his Phocyas in the ſiege of Damaſcus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are inimitable; and his late attempt in Oreſtes in the Diſtreſſ'd Mother, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly gained him no ſmall ſhare of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, being chaſte and reſpectable through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole. And were there not quite ſuch a repeated ſameneſs in Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s

under the banners of Mr. Sheridan in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; it being here where he broke out a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median of the firſt rank.

                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0587800400:56"/>
Mr. BARRY's firſt outſet in this ſphere of life was in the part of Othello, to the ſurprizing ſatisfaction and amazement of the general audience; for ſure never did young actor ſhew ſuch judgment in the choice of his firſt part; he ſeemed a finiſhed Othello (as Chetwood terms it) dropt from the clouds, which has ever ſince continued to be his favourite character; and if we take a ſlight ſurvey of Mr. <hi>Barry</hi>'s features, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we need not wonder at his ſucceſs in this part. Firſt, the graces of manly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which are ſo favourably blended in his perſon; ſecondly, the prodigious flexibility and harmony of his voice, which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently adapted for the exhibition of Othello; in ſhort, in this part and others I ſhall mention, he is beyond critical excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For example, where is his equal in Jaffier, Romeo, and Caſtalio, he is not even ſurpaſſed by the mighty chief Mr. <hi>Garrick;</hi> though I am extremely partial to that gentleman's abilities, yet juſtice obliges me to make this obſervation, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0587800400:57"/>
there are many ſcenes in the two firſt parts, in which Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> eminently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: but upon critical examination, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be generally allowed, through the whole courſe of thoſe characters, Mr. <hi>Barry</hi> takes the lead: though to draw any ſort of parallel between thoſe two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be beyond my judgment, and conſequently preſumptive, therefore I ſhall content myſelf with only making mention of a circumſtance of this ſort, and leave the reſt for ſome more able critic to purſue. As to Caſtalio, I don't at this time recollect an inſtance of Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi>'s performing it; Mr. <hi>Barry</hi>'s ſuperiority over any other actor in the lover's part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt undoubtedly render him in this character matchleſs, from his amorous harmony of features, melting eyes, and unequalled plaintiveneſs of voice, which are requiſites ſo peculiarly happy for forming the lover, that it is no wonder Mr. <hi>Barry</hi> ſhould excell ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any other performer in this province.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0587800400:58"/>
I remember once to have ſeen this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Romeo, particularly in the garden ſcene of this favourite play, (where Juliet appears at the window) I thought he ſpoke the following lines incomparably fine, with a ſyrenic ſweetneſs of voice.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>See how ſhe leans her cheek upon her hand.</l>
                     <l>Oh! that I were a glove upon that hand,</l>
                     <l>That I might touch that cheek.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And afterwards when Juliet replies, "Ah! me," then with what extacy he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoke theſe words:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—She ſpeaks! ſhe ſpeaks!</l>
                     <l>Oh! ſpeak again, bright angel, for thou art</l>
                     <l>As glorious to this ſight, being o'er my head,</l>
                     <l>As is a winged meſſenger from Heaven.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the parting ſcene in the third act of this play, I likewiſe thought him exceeding pictureſque and affecting, where he takes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0587800400:59"/>
leave of Juliet in a ſhort ſentence, ending as follows:</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>He ſeemed to penetrate the foregoing line into the hearts of the moſt diſtant ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators: but what I moſtly admired in Mr. <hi>Barry</hi>'s performance of this part, was the beginning of the tomb ſcene, where Juliet wakes; here a tranſport of joy, love, and tenderneſs flows within him; with what acclamation and rapture he delivered this ſentence:</p>

England, but in what character, or where for a certainty, I will not preſume to ſay; however, be this as it will, it is now two ſeaſons ſince ſhe firſt appeared at Covent-Garden theatre, in the character of Jane Shore, in which ſhe was received with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable marks of applauſe by a very bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant audience.—This Lady is an exceeding good ſigure; in her perſon ſhe is tall and elegant, her face is likewiſe remarkably handſome, and her whole deportment gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel and eaſy; in ſhort, ſhe is the fineſt figure on the London ſtage: therefore it is not to be wondered, a lady endued with ſuch requiſites for this profeſſion ſhould gain great applauſe, had ſhe abſolutely little or no merit.

               <p>Having given an account of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal actors and actreſſes, that have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſtage for upwards of two years back, I ſhall now favour the reader with ſome remarks on the inferior performers,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0587800400:87"/>
ſuch as are not deſtitute of merit, although annot be deemed as capitals; the firſt of thoſe gentry ſtands Mr. Lee Lewes, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a thriving and pleaſing comedian; there is a ſmartneſs in his manner that muſt one time render him conſiderable. The next are Mr. J. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ckin and Mr Wroughton, two reſpectable performers where nothing great is wanting; the firſt much ſuperior to the latter in critical eſtimation, being a juſt and decent performer; the other is too much guilty of mouthing, as Shakeſpeare terms it, and is not totally engaging in his manner, and wants expreſſion, &amp;c. Mr. Dunſtall is a good low comedian, but like the preceding gentleman, too much of a mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: notwithſtanding, his Hodge, and Sir Jealous Traffick, are inimitable, ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters being happily ſuited to his manner. Mr. Jefferſon and Mr. Packer are uſeful men, the firſt conſiderably the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and pretty equal in comedy, though both bordering on the palm of inſipidity.—Mr. Hull is a gentleman who underſtands
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0587800400:88"/>
his author, and the drama, exceeding well, is very capable of ſupporting paternal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but for want of powers in other views, he is no ways important as an actor, though a very chaſte and reſpectable dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic writer. Mr Clinch and Mr Diamond, theſe two gentlemen ſtarted the ſame ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at Drury-lane theatre, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in October 1772, the one in Alexander the Great, the other in Romeo; Mr. Clinch has ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a Clinch, for he clinches ſo voci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferouſly, that if he is not leſs violent, he will inevitably tear himſelf, and his parts to rags; therefore I would adviſe him not to be ſo laviſh with his ſuperfluous fire and action, as by obſerving this obſervation, he would buſtle through his caſt of characters with much more decency and applauſe than he uſually does. Mr Diamond diſplayed on his firſt appearance, very conſpicuous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſome ſcenes of Romeo; in others, he was totally inſufficient, in judgment, voice, and expreſſion, particularly in the frantic ſcenes; but on the whole, he ſupported
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0587800400:89"/>
that character (conſidering his age, which was then but nineteen,) with tolerable eaſe and propriety: Mr. Diamond has left Drury-lane, but in what quarter of the globe he is at preſent, I will not preſume to fay. Mr Lacy; this gentleman made his appearance laſt winter in Alexander, but not meeting (in his attempt) with ſo much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic indulgence as was literally expected, he has, I believe, cordially relinquiſhed all thoughts of any future trial on the ſtage. Mr. Melmoth; this ingenious perſon came out laſt benefit time, in the part of Cyrus, which character he went through with candid applauſe; he has ſince played Hamlet, and is far from being contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it, having a very good knowledge of his author, and a juſt conception of the part, and with a little cultivation of his talents, he may be enabled to make no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtand as a tragedian. Meſſ. Banniſter, Reinhold, and Du-Bellamy; nothing of ſpeakers, but well eſteemed ſingers; the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0587800400:90"/>
two firſt have excellent baſe voices, the laſt an inimitable counter, though greatly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a defective ear to muſic. There are many more I could thruſt into my account, ſuch as Mr. Waldron, Mr. Young, Mr. Booth, Mr. Brereton, &amp;c. &amp;c. but are not worthy our attention; as ſuch I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ladies in this circle of action; among which ſtands foremoſt, Mrs. Pitt; this is a truly great actreſs in her walk, which is in the parts of ſuperannuated old maids, without her equal on the ſtage. The next ſtands Mrs. Leſſingham and Mrs. Melmoth, the former is very agreeable in ſome parts of comedy, but wretchedly hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in tragedy; being deſtitute of voice, manner, expreſſion, and in ſhort, almoſt every requiſite; the latter has not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted comedy, but has continued (ſince her firſt appearance in Caliſta, in the Fair Penitent) to be very reſpectable in ſeveral parts of tragedy, and ſeems to be a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lady. Mrs. Greville and Miſs Jarratt; two very pretty women, and thriving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0587800400:91"/>

            <head>In a LETTER to a Young LADY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Miſs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I TAKE this opportunity to fulfil your requeſt, as it is unbounded happineſs to me at all times to devote myſelf to your ſervice, but I am exceſſive bad at compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I therefore ſhall leave theſe to nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, &amp;c. and proceed to the ſubject of the play; which is a very affecting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The ſtory on which this tragedy is founded, is that of Iphigenia, which is wrought up with ſuch maſterly elocution by Mr. Otway the author, that thoſe audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who are not excited at the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0587800400:93"/>
of this play, muſt be void of common feeling; and more eſpecially when a Barry appears in Caſtalio, or a Mrs. Barry in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimia, or the excellent performance of a Garrick in Chamont, which I remember to have ſeen; and when thus ſupported by three ſuch inimitable ornaments, together with the enraptured ſtile of the author, who then I ſay, but the dulleſt, unfeeling auditor, but what muſt be excited at ſuch an exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for who can behold the diſtreſsful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations of Caſtalio, and the injured Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, without ſharing in their affliction.—The firſt ſcene in this play that ſhould raiſe our paſſions, is in the ſecond act, where Monimia upbraids Caſtalio for his leaving her alone to the intreaties of his brother Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidore; which he, like an equivocating friend, does, in order to calm his brother's rage; ſeeing the ardour of his paſſion for her, and not willing to offend him, imagining at the ſame time, all Polidore's ſolicitations to Monimia would be in vain, being ſenſible Monimia's affections were entirely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0587800400:94"/>
Therefore what auditor would not be affected at Caſtalio's griefs, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his heart upbraids him, and vows ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to liſten to him more. What diſtreſs the poor crying Caſtalio appears to be in, when he ſpeaks the following ſentence to her.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Who can hear this, and bear an equal mind,</l>
               <l>Since you will drive me from you, I muſt go;</l>
               <l>But Oh! Monimia, when thou haſt baniſhed me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>No creeping ſlave, though tractable and dull</l>
               <l>As artful woman, for her end would chuſe,</l>
               <l>Shall ever dote as I have done, for Oh!</l>
               <l>No tongue my pleaſure nor my pains, can tell,</l>
               <l>Tis Heav'n to have thee, and without thee Hell.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Then after he has ſpoken the foregoing ſentence, when his beloved Monimia is ſo charmed with the muſic of his tongue, that ſhe forgives and pities him. Then what extatic joy flows immediate within him; with what rapture does the following ſpeech come from his mouth. But never
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0587800400:95"/>
more ſo, than when it is delivered by the ſweet, melodious, and expreſſive voice, and manner of a Barry.</p>

            <p>The next and moſt affecting circumſtance in this play is in the third act, after Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's marriage with Monimia, when they confer together concerning enjoying at night their nuptial happineſs; <q>which, after ſome intreaty, Monimia condeſcends, when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0587800400:96"/>
all the family are at reſt, to let him into her chamber, when he, Caſtalio, by order of Monimia is to make a certain ſignal, (<q>which is three ſoft taps at the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door</q>)</q> at which he is to gain admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but, alas! unhappily his brother Polidore liſtens, and over-hears the whole tenor of their appointment; therefore, not knowing of their marriage, Polidore is much chagrined at the thoughts of Caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's happineſs, he was going to reap with the fair Monimia. In conſequence, he contrives a plot to enjoy her if poſſible him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: accordingly he gets his little page Cordelia to go and trifle with Caſtalio in order to delay the time; in the mean while, he counterfeits his brother, and with the aforeſaid ſignal gains entrance, and enjoys Monimia; ſhe at the ſame time miſtaking him for her lord Caſtalio.—Unfortunately, the poor fond adorer comes, according to his appointment made, glowing with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the thoughts of his bliſsful night to come with his dear Monimia; but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0587800400:97"/>
he is refuſed admittance by the maid ſervant, being conſcious (as ſhe thought) ſhe let Caſtalio in before, and imagining the real huſband to be the counterfeit Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidore. Who can behold ſuch a ſcene as this, without ſharing in the diſtreſſes of Caſtalio? and more eſpecially, when he lay down at the door almoſt diſtracted, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is Monimia's cruelty that has uſed him thus.</p>
            <p>In the fourth act, we ſee Caſtalio up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid Monimia in the moſt fervent manner poſſible, for her ſevere treatment, as he ſuppoſed, which ſhe is greatly ſurpriſed at, and well ſhe may be, when at the ſight of him ſhe flies with energy to his arms, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining how happy ſhe was in his embraces the preceding night; at the ſame time, as I have obſerved, it was the profligate Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore. What ſhould moſt excite our feeling in this act, is to ſee the injured Monimia dragged like a dog by her beloved Caſtalio to the door, when he cruelly breaks from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0587800400:98"/>
her with all the fierceneſs of a fiend; and afterwards when ſhe acquaints her brother Chamont, of the ſevere and unexpected treatment which ſhe has received from her lord; at which, how chagrined and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated is Chamont for the injury done to his ſiſter, and vows vengeance on Caſtalio: with what exclamation he ſpeaks the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines to old Acaſto Caſtalio's father.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—I ſay my ſiſter's wrong'd,</l>
               <l>Monimia my ſiſter, born as high,</l>
               <l>And noble as Caſtalio,—do her juſtice,</l>
               <l>Or, by the Gods, I'll lay a ſcene of blood,</l>
               <l>Shall make this dwelling horrible to nature;</l>
               <l>I'll do't—hark you, my lord, your ſon Caſtalio,</l>
               <l>Take him to your cloſet, and there teach him manners.</l>
            </q>
            <p>With what unbounded excellence Mr. Garrick ſpeaks the above ſentence; what contempt he ſhews when he utters the laſt two lines, that ſo elegantly diſcovers how much he is diſpleaſed at the cruel uſage done
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0587800400:99"/>
to Monimia; that in ſhort, this laſt ſcene is exceeding natural and affecting.—The laſt act, at the riſing of the curtain, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the unhappy Caſtalio lying on the ground in a ſtate of lunacy, curſing Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and all the inconſtant ſex of women, till a ſervant enters, and acquaints him, how wild and intemperate Monimia is for to behold her lord; at which he relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es all of a ſudden into love and tenderneſs for her. <q>Soon after, Monimia enters, and after ſome conference together, ſhe tells him, <q>She is reſolved from that day never more to ſee his face again</q>:</q> in what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsful accents he immediately after ſpeaks this ſentence:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Where am I! ſure I wander 'midſt enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</l>
               <l>And never more ſhall find the way to reſt;</l>
               <l>But, Oh! Monimia, art thou indeed reſolv'd</l>
               <l>To puniſh me with everlaſting abſence;</l>
               <l>Why turn'ſt thou from me, I am alone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;</l>

               <l>And pleaſe myſelf withal, whilſt my heart's breaking.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Mrs. Barry, the original Monimia, I am told, always ſhed tears at this beautiful, or rather bewitching paſſage, as it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſo called; and afterwards when ſhe replied and exits, "Ah! poor Caſtalio," I have heard, in ſpeaking theſe three words ſhe has been ſo much affected, ſeeing at that inſtant the diſtreſſed ſituation Caſtalio appeared to be in, that it was always ſome
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0587800400:101"/>
time before ſhe rightly could recover her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and dull muſt be the apprehenſion of the auditor that is not affected with ſuch a ſcene: notwithſtanding what we ſee is only feigned to us; yet, in all probability, the ſtory from whence the origin of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy was founded was true, wherefore, ſuch an inſtance repreſented ſhould moſt certainly excite our feelings. But, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the cataſtrophe of this play is very judiciouſly wound up by the author, and abounds with a variety of incidents; for here we ſee the fall of Monimia, Caſtalio, and Polidore, and Chamont vowing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on Acaſto and all his houſe, for the injury done his ſiſter. The concluſion is prodigiouſly affecting, though our pity ſhould only be reſerved for the good old father Acaſto, the injured Monimia, and the poor unfortunate ſon Caſtalio; as the fall of Polidore ſhould not in the leaſt affect us, he being nothing more than a mere proſelyte of vice.—The author of this play (I believe it will be generally allowed by all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0587800400:102"/>
impartial judges) wrote more immediately to the heart in painting the tender paſſions than any of his predeceſſors; or, in ſhort, any of his cotemporaries, excepting Rowe' who in his productions comes the neareſt to Otway of any other dramatic author, either ancient or modern, particularly in his favourite tragedy of the Fair Penitent; where all the characters in this play are ſupported with ſo much judgment, and the language ſo extremely elegant, as is the Orphan, that by the great reſemblance there is in the ſtyle of theſe two plays, we might almoſt imagine them to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of one man: though it muſt be confeſſed, Rowe in his dialogues is more chaſte and praiſe worthy than Otway; for the latter is in many inſtances indecent, and deficient of moral tendency, which the former ſtrictly confined himſelf to; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the Orphan, Polidore's alluſion of the bull is contemptible and abſurd in the higheſt degree; and in the little page's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter there are many indecencies, eſpecially
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0587800400:103"/>
for a child to ſpeak, (it being moſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one) but we muſt impute them to the licentiouſneſs of the age he wrote in.

               <salute>Dear Mifs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEING ever (as I told you in my laſt) devoted to your ſervice; I therefore, in compliance with your requeſt, a ſecond time, and in order to fulfil my promiſe, have ſent you a few thoughts on the <hi>Fair Penitent</hi> accordingly.—The ſubject of this play is an excellent moral; it ſhews in an eminent degree, the dangerous conſequence of parents forcing their children into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage againſt their own inclinations; and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0587800400:105"/>
paints nature in a very conſpicuous manner. Mr. Wilkes in his general review of the ſtage, remarks on this tragedy, that there is not one character in the whole play de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves compaſſion; yet, I muſt confeſs, I am of a different opinion: and he further obſerves, the heroine of this play has no manner of right to the above title; <q>that gentleman ſays, <q>her grief does not ſpring from compunction, but from a variety of paſſions which ſhe is prevented from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying:</q>
               </q> probably he would have the play termed "The Penitent Proſtitute," which I think is far too groſs a title, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe yields to Lothario before her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Altamont. In my poor opinion, I think her rather to be pitied, as many of her ſex, that would be ſtrictly virtuous, are liable to the ſame failing in the heat of blood, (as I pleaſe thus vulgarly to term it) and eſpecially with a man ſhe ſincerely loved. Is not Sciolto her father in the wrong, when he knows ſhe loves Lothario, to force her into marriage with another
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0587800400:106"/>
man whom ſhe has not the leaſt veneration for: though her huſband is paſſionately doating of her, what is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the purpoſe, when it is quite the reverſe with Caliſta; for if both hearts do not mutually agree in the conjugal ſtate, how is it poſſible the parties can be happy? How many, like Caliſta, have been deluded by the ſoothing tales of the male ſex, and by their proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marriage, as Lothario did to Caliſta, and afterwards deceived them. To be ſure, Lothario is a rakiſh young gentleman, and like many more of the preſent age, when he has gained his ends, in enjoying the fair flame, he afterwards has no further regard; as Foote ſays, "When they are gratified, then they are ſatisfied."</p>
            <p>Therefore, dear Miſs, (though my own ſex) be cautious how you liſten to their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring enticements, for it is exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earious truſting men, there being ſo many ſeducers, that your ſex cannot have too great a guard over themſelves; and they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0587800400:107"/>
have ſo many wheedling and trepanning ways to decoy poor harmleſs and unthinking maids, by telling them (as Mackheath ſays) a hundred things which they never mean to perform, things that your ſex are apt to put too much confidence in: through which means, they ſometimes render themſelves a common prey to their lewd and abandoned deſires, and then inevitable ruin conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enſues: and at the ſame time, they not only reflect diſhonour upon themſelves, but likewiſe bring much trouble and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their aged parents, that have taken great care and diligence in bringing them up to an age of diſcretion, and in hopes of ſeeing them tread in the paths of virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, they too, too often fall a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their ſpotleſs virginity, (like the heroine of the foregoing play) by building their hopes on ſuch a ſandy foundation as perfidious men; as ſuch they become the ſcoff and ridicule of all their former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and are deſpiſed by thoſe who before were their moſt ardent friends, I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0587800400:108"/>
could dwell with energy much longer on this ſubject, but being rather obliged to proceed with the few remarks I have to make on the play, it will be inconſiſtent and intruding on your patience: but before I proceed, I muſt beg to be excuſed for the little I have ſaid on the above topic, as my motive for interſperſing this matter, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely for the love of your future welfare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſuch, and for no other reaſon, was it wrote. But to the play. Though, does not Caliſta after her marriage with Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont reject all Lothario's offers with the utmoſt contempt, when he wants to enjoy her a ſecond time, with thoſe words:</p>
            <q>
               <l>How didſt thou dare to think that I would live,</l>
               <l>A ſlave to baſe deſires, and brutal pleaſures;</l>
               <l>To be a wretched wanton for thy leiſures,</l>
               <l>To toy, and waſte an hour of idle time with,</l>
               <l>My ſoul diſdains thee for ſo mean a thought.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0587800400:109"/>
In ſhort, I think her all through the play, an object fully deſerving pity. As for the poor fond and gentle Altamont, I likewiſe pity his caſe much, although the ill uſage he treats his friend Horatio with; for it is naturally to be ſuppoſed, he would put more confidence in the ſtory the object of his heart related, than that which his friend told him, and eſpecially at a time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves her ſpotleſs. How often do we ſee a circumſtance of this kind among the lower claſs of people, a man and his wife ſhall quarrel, or what not, a friend comes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terferes in behalf of the parties: then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gets moſt infamouſly abuſed for his civility. As for Sciolto the father, claims ſcarce any compaſſion; as he may partly thank himſelf for all the ſorrow and ſhame he has brought on his old age; and I ſincerely wiſh that every parent whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has endued with a family of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, would take warning by Sciolto's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0587800400:110"/>
and not force them into marriage againſt their own conſent; but as ſir Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Traffic, in the Buſy Body ſays,</p>
            <q>
               <l>By my example let all parents move,</l>
               <l>And never ſtrive to croſs their children's love;</l>
               <l>They ſhould ſubmit that care to providence above.</l>

By which he hopes to draw a tender tear</l>

               <l>On theſe imagin'd things the youth relies,</l>
