            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
DESIGN.</head>
            <p>HAVING propoſed to write ſome Pieces on Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Life and Manners, ſuch as (to uſe my Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi>'s expreſſion) <hi>come home to Men's Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Boſoms,</hi> I thought it more ſatisfactory to begin
with conſidering <hi>Man</hi> in the Abſtract, his <hi>Nature</hi> and
his <hi>State</hi>: ſince to prove any moral Duty, to inforce any
moral Precept, or to examine the Perfection or Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any Creature whatſoever, it is neceſſary firſt to
know what <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> it is placed in, and
what is the proper <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of its <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Science of Human Nature is, like all other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
reduced to a <hi>few, clear Points</hi>: There are not many
<hi>certain Truths</hi> in this World. It is therefore in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
of the Mind as in that of the Body; more Good will
accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and
perceptible parts, than by ſtudying too much ſuch finer
nerves and veſſels as will for ever eſcape our obſervation.
The <hi>Diſputes</hi> are all upon theſe laſt, and I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:0811000300:5"/>
to ſay, they have leſs ſharpen'd the <hi>Wits</hi> than the
<hi>Hearts</hi> of Men againſt each other, and have diminiſhed
the Practiſe, more than advanced the Theory, of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
If I could flatter my ſelf that this Eſſay has any
Merit, it is in ſteering betwixt Doctrines ſeemingly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite,
in paſſing over Terms utterly un-intelligible, and
in forming out of all a <hi>temperate</hi> yet not <hi>inconſiſtent,</hi>
and a <hi>ſhort</hi> yet not <hi>imperfect</hi> Syſtem of Ethics.</p>
            <p>This I might have done in Proſe; but I choſe Verſe,
and even Rhyme, for two reaſons. The one will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
obvious; that Principles, Maxims, or Precepts
ſo written, both ſtrike the reader more ſtrongly at firſt,
and are more eaſily retained by him afterwards. The
other may ſeem odd but is true; I found I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
them more <hi>ſhortly</hi> this way than in Proſe itſelf,
and nothing is more certain than that much of the <hi>Force</hi>
as well as <hi>Grace</hi> of Arguments or Inſtructions depends
on their Conciſeneſs. I was unable to treat this part
of my ſubject more in <hi>detail,</hi> without becoming dry and
tedious; or more <hi>poetically,</hi> without ſacrificing Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
to Ornament, without wandring from the Preciſion,
or breaking the Chain of Reaſoning. If any man can unite
all theſe, without diminution of any of them, I freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
he will compaſs a thing above my capacity.</p>
            <p>What is now publiſhed, is only to be conſidered as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Map</hi> of <hi>MAN,</hi> marking out no more than the <hi>Greater</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:0811000300:6"/>
               <hi>Parts,</hi> their <hi>Extent,</hi> their <hi>Limits,</hi> and their <hi>Connection,</hi>
but leaving the Particular to be more fully delineated in
the Charts which are to follow. Conſequently, theſe Epiſtles
in their progreſs will become leſs dry, and more ſuſceptible
of Poetical Ornament. I am here only opening the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and clearing the paſſage; To deduce the <hi>Rivers,</hi> to
follow them in their Courſe, and to obſerve their Effects,
will be a task more agreeable.</p>

                  <p>OF <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Abſtract.</hi> We can judge only with regard
to our <hi>own Syſtem,</hi> being ignorant of the <hi>Relations</hi> of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems
and Things, VER. 17, &amp;c. to 68. Man is not
therefore to be deem'd <hi>Imperfect,</hi> but a Being ſuited to his <hi>Place</hi>
and <hi>Rank</hi> in the Creation, agreeable to the <hi>General Order</hi> of
Things, and conformable to <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> to him unknown.
69, &amp;c. It is partly upon this <hi>Ignorance</hi> of future Events, and
partly upon the <hi>Hope</hi> of a Future State, that all his Happineſs in
the preſent depends, 73, &amp;c. His <hi>Pride,</hi> in aiming at more <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
and pretending to more <hi>Perfection,</hi> the cauſe of his Error
and Miſery, 109. 119. The <hi>Impiety</hi> of putting himſelf in the
<pb facs="tcp:0811000300:8"/>
place of <hi>God,</hi> and judging of the fitneſs or unfitneſs, perfection
or imperfection, juſtice or injuſtice of his diſpenſations, 109 <hi>to</hi>
120. The <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of conceiting himſelf the <hi>final cauſe</hi> of the
creation, or expecting that Perfection in the <hi>moral</hi> world which
is not in the <hi>natural,</hi> 127 <hi>to</hi> 164. The <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of his
complaints againſt Providence, while on the one hand he demands
the perfections of the Angels, on the other the bodily qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Brutes, 165. That the gift of <hi>Reaſon alone</hi> counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
all the latter, and that to poſſeſs any of the <hi>ſenſitive faculties</hi> in
a higher degree, would render him miſerable, 181 <hi>to</hi> 198. That
throughout the whole viſible world, an univerſal <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
in theſe is obſerv'd, which cauſes a <hi>ſubordination</hi> of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to creature, and of all creatures of man. The gradations of
<hi>ſenſe, inſtinct, thought, reflection, reaſon,</hi> 199 <hi>to</hi> 224. How
much <hi>farther</hi> this order and ſubordination of living creatures may
extend, above and below us? 225. Were any <hi>part</hi> of this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
not that part only, but the <hi>whole</hi> connected <hi>Creation</hi> muſt be
deſtroyed. The extravagance, madneſs, and pride of ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,

                     <hi>HAppineſs</hi> ill defin'd by the Philoſophers, VER. 19. That it
is the <hi>End</hi> of all men, and attainable by all, 28. God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
by <hi>general,</hi> not <hi>particular</hi> laws: intends Happineſs to be <hi>equal</hi>;
and to be ſo it muſt be <hi>ſocial,</hi> ſince all particular happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on general, 35. As it is neceſſary for <hi>Order,</hi> and the peace
and welfare of <hi>Society,</hi> that <hi>External goods</hi> ſhould be <hi>unequal,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
is not made to conſiſt in theſe, 47. But, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that inequality, the Balance of Happineſs among mankind is
kept even by Providence, by the two Paſſions of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> 66.
What the happineſs of Individuals is? as far as is conſiſtent with
the conſtitution of this world, 76. That the <hi>good man</hi> has here
the advantage, 80. The error of imputing to <hi>Virtue</hi> what are
only the calamities of <hi>Nature,</hi> or of <hi>Fortune,</hi> 92. The folly of
expecting that God ſhould alter his General Laws in favour of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
118. That we are not judges <hi>who are good?</hi> but that
whoever they are, they muſt be <hi>happieſt,</hi> 130, &amp;c. That <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:0811000300:11"/>
