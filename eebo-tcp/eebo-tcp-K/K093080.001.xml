            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <figure/>ON THE PROSPECT OF PEACE, A POEM. By THOMAS TICKELL, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. Tickell was born in the year 1686, at Bridekirk in Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where his father, a clergyman, then lived. He became a member of Queen's College, Oxford, in April 1701. On the 22d of February, 1708, he took the degree of M. A. and two years afterwards was choſen Fellow of his College. During his reſidence at the Univerſity, the Opera of Roſamond was performed, and on its appearance, Mr. Tickell addreſſed a Poem to Mr. Addiſon, the Author, which was ſo well received, that it laid the foundation of an intimacy between the two friends, and proved of the greateſt advantage to Mr. Tickell's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fortune. When Mr. Addiſon went to Ireland as Secretary to Lord Sunderland, Mr. Tickell accompanied him, and was employed in public buſineſs. In 1717, he became Under Secretary of State, and about 1725, was appointed Secretary to the Lords Juſtices of Ireland, a place of great honour, in the enjoyment whereof he continued until his death, which happened at Bath, on the 23d of April 1740.</note> To the LORD PRIVY-SEAL.<note n="b" place="bottom">This was Dr. John Robinſon, then Biſhop of Briſtol, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of London. He was born near Richmond in Yorkſhire, and reſided ſome years at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M. A. March 5, 1683, and of D. D. by diploma, 7th of Auguſt 1710. He had lived many years in Sweden, firſt as Chaplain to the Ambaſſador, and afterwards in the quality of Ambaſſador himſelf. In both theſe ſtations he conducted himſelf with great credit and advantage to the government. On his return home, he was preferred to a Prebend at Canterbury, then to the Deanry of Windſor, and afterwards to the Biſhoprick of Briſtol. In 1711, the cuſtody of the Privy Seal was given to him, and he was nominated one of the Plenipotentiaries to negotiate the treaty of Utrecht. On the 13th March, 1713, he was tranſlated to the See of London, and died 11th of April 1723.</note>

It has always been eſteemed a very ingenious defence of the principles of Quakeriſm, even by thoſe who deny the doctrines which it endeavours to eſtabliſh. The Author was born at Edinburgh in 1648, and received part of his education at the Scots College in Paris, where his uncle was Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. His father became one of the earlieſt converts to the new Sect, and from his example, the ſon ſeems to have been induced to tread in his ſteps.

By JOHN ARBUTHNOT<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Arbuthnot was deſcended from a noble family in Scotland, and was the ſon of a clergyman of the Epiſcopal Church in that kingdom. He was born at Arbuthnot in Kincardinſhire, not long after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration; and received his education at Aberdeen, where he took his Doctor's degree. He ſoon afterwards removed to London, and was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometime in teaching the mathematics. On St. Andrew's day 1704, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; and on the 30th October following, was ſworn Phyſician extraordinary to Queen Anne; upon the indiſpoſition of Dr. Hannes, he was appointed fourth Phyſician in ordinary to the Queen; and on 27th April 1710, was admitted a Fellow of the College of Phyſicians. The death of Queen Anne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his place and reſidence at Court. On 30th September 1723, he was named ſecond Cenſor of the College of Phyſicians; and on the 5th October 1727, became an Elect of the ſame Society.

               <lg>
                  <l>Then JONSON came, inſtructed from the ſchool,</l>

                  <l>His ſtudious patience, and laborious art,</l>
                  <l>By regular approach aſſail'd the heart;</l>

                  <l>A mortal born, he met the general doom,</l>

                  <l>The wits of Charles found eaſier ways to fame,</l>
                  <l>Nor wiſh'd for JONSON'S art, or SHAKSPEARE'S flames:</l>
                  <l>Themſelves they ſtudied, as they felt their writ;</l>
                  <l>Intrigue was plot, obſcenity was wit.</l>
                  <l>Vice always found a ſympathetic friend,</l>
                  <l>They pleas'd their age, and did not aim to mend.</l>
                  <l>Yet bards like theſe aſpir'd to laſting praiſe,</l>
                  <l>And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days.</l>
                  <l>Their cauſe was gen'ral, their ſupports were ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>Their ſlaves were willing, and their reign was long;</l>
                  <l>'Till ſhame regain'd the poſt that ſenſe betray'd,</l>
                  <l>And Virtue call'd Oblivion to her aid.</l>

                  <l>Then cruſh'd by rules, and weaken'd as refin'd,</l>
                  <l>For years the power of tragedy declin'd;</l>
                  <l>From bard to bard the frigid caution crept,</l>
                  <l>'Till declamation roar'd, while paſſion ſlept.</l>
                  <l>Yet ſtill did Virtue deign the ſtage to tread,</l>
                  <l>Philoſophy remain'd, though Nature fled.</l>
                  <l>But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit,</l>

                  <l>Exulting Folly hail'd the joyful day,</l>

                  <l>Perhaps if ſkill could diſtant times explore,</l>

                  <l>The ſtage but echoes back the public voice,</l>
                  <l>The drama's laws the drama's patrons give,</l>
                  <l>For we that live to pleaſe, muſt pleaſe, to live.</l>

                  <l>As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die;</l>

               <head>GRONGAR HILL. Near CAERMARTHEN, South Wales. By Mr. DYER<note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. John Dyer was the ſecond ſon of Robert Dyer of Aberglaſney, in Caermarthenſhire, a ſolicitor of great capacity and note. He was born in the year 1700, and received his education at Weſtminſter-ſchool, from whence he returned home, being deſigned for his father's profeſſion. Diſliking the ſtudy of the law, he relinquiſhed it on the death of his parent, and having an inclination for painting, became a pupil to Mr. Richardſon. He then travelled into Italy, continued ſome time at Rome, and came back to England in 1740. His proficiency at an artiſt ſeems to have been but inconſiderable; and this circumſtance, joined to an ill ſtate of health, and the love of ſtudy, determined him to the church. He therefore entered into holy orders, and in 1741 ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the living of Calthorp, in Leiceſterſhire, on which he lived ten years, and then exchanged it for Belchford, in Lincolnſhire. In 1752 he was preſented to the rectory of Coningſby, and ſoon after had that of Kirkby given him in addition. On the two latter he remained during the reſt of his life, which ended in July 1758, of a conſumptive diſorder, which he had ſtruggled with many years.</note>.</head>

Ficaroni ſays, he ſaw an architect of Verona uncover ſome of the buried part, and found there was an aſcent of three ſteps to it. All the arches within were covered with ornaments of ſtucco, of which there are ſome ſtill remaining. This noble fabric had ſeats ſufficient to contain eighty-five thouſand ſpectators. The ſeats are all gone, but the ſlope ſtill remains on which they were placed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt round the arena. It is built of Tiburtine ſtone, which has not a fine grain, but is very durable. The outſide of about one half is all ſtanding yet, quite up to the top. The body of the amphitheatre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſeats, conſiſted of double galleries, that is, galleries di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with pillars all along the middle of them; each gallery going quite round and incloſing the ſeats, as they did the arena. There were four ſtories of theſe galleries; three of them were properly porticoes of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. The uppermoſt is adorned with pilaſters of the Corinthian or Compoſite order, and is lighted by windows in the wall between the pilaſters, and not laid open as the other three are. Some parts of all the galleries are yet intire, for a conſiderable extent together, with the ſeveral communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations between them, and the ſeats by the vomitoria (as they called the mouths of the paſſages, through which the crowds of people were poured into the amphitheatre to ſee the ſhews;) and ſuch parts as ſtill remain, give us a ſufficient idea of what the whole was when the circle was compleat. Several of the fornices too, below, under the ſeats, where the ſlaves and wild beaſts were kept, that were let out for combat into the arena, remain pretty entire to this day.</q>

               <head>THE SCHOOL-MISTRESS. A POEM, In IMITATION of SPENSER. By WILLIAM SHENSTONE, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">William Shenſtone, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was born at the Leaſowes, in the pariſh of Hales Owen, and county of Salop, Nov. 1714. He was taught to read by the old dame whom he has delivered to poſterity in the preſent poem, after which, he went ſome time to the grammar-ſchool in Hales Owen, then to Mr. Crompton, an eminent ſchoolmaſter at Solihul, and in 1732 was entered a commoner of Pembroke College, Oxford. He continued his name at the Univerſity ten years, but took no degree, nor made the ſlighteſt effort to engage in any profeſſion. After ſpending a few years with great inattention to his fortune, and much to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of it, he, about the year 1745, went to reſide upon his eſtate, which he ornamented with ſo much taſte, that it became one of the chief objects of curioſity, to thoſe whom buſineſs or pleaſure called to that part of the kingdom. Unfortunately for Mr. Shenſtone, his income was not equal to the expence which his improvements demanded. He embarraſſed his circumſtances, and dragged out the latter part of his life diſcontentedly, and in diſtreſs. It is ſaid, that if he had lived a little longer, he would have been aſſiſted by a penſion, which death prevented him from enjoying. He died at the Leaſowes, of a putrid fever, about five on Friday morning, Feb. 11, 1763, and was buried in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of Hales Owen.</note>

               <head>AN ESSAY ON CONVERSATION. By BENJAMIN STILLINGFLEET<note n="a" place="bottom">Benjamin Stillingfleet, was the only ſon of Edward Stillingfleet, a clergyman in the county of Norfolk, and grandſon to Dr. Stillingfleet, Biſhop of Worceſter. He was educated at Norwich ſchool, which he left in 1720, and went to Trinity College Cambridge, where Dr. Bentley, who had been private tutor to his father, was then Maſter. He became a candidate while there for a fellowſhip, but through the influence of Dr. Bentley, was rejected. On this diſappointment, he quitted the Univerſity, and travelled with Mr. Wyndham of Felbrig, in Norfolk, to whom this Poem is addreſſed, and with whom he lived in the moſt intimate and unreſerved friendſhip. By the favour of the late Lord Barrington, he was appointed maſter of the barracks at Kenſington, a place which enabled him to purſue his ſtudies, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly his favourite one of Natural Hiſtory, with ſucceſs. He was the author of ſeveral valuable works which have been publiſhed, and of others which have not hitherto appeared. He died a batchelor, in the year 1771, at the age of upwards of ſeventy years, and was buried in Saint James's church.</note>.</head>

               <head>ODE, to a LADY. On the Death of Col. CHARLES ROSS, in the Action at Fontenoy. Written May 1745. By Mr. W. COLLINS<note n="a" place="bottom">William Collins was born at Chicheſter on the 25th day of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, about 1720. His father was a hatter. In 1733 he was admitted a ſcholar of Wincheſter college, and in 1740 ſtood firſt in the liſt of the ſcholars in ſucceſſion at New College; but there being no vacancy at that time, he became a commoner of Queen's College, and in about half a year after was elected a Demy of Magdalen College, where he continued until he had taken a Batchelor's degree, and then ſuddenly left the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. This event happened about the year 1744. He immediately came to London, and commenced a literary adventurer; in which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city he was not diligent enough to keep himſelf from want. In a ſhort time he was relieved from his diſtreſſes by the death of his uncle, Mr. Martin, a lieutenant colonel, who left him about £. 2,000. From this period his health began to decline, and he gradually fell into that ſtate of depreſſion of mind which enchains the faculties without deſtroying them, and leaves reaſon the knowledge of right without the power of purſuing it. Theſe clouds which he perceived gathering on his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, he endeavoured to diſperſe by travel, and paſſed into France; but found himſelf conſtrained to yield to his malady, and returned. He was for ſome time confined in a houſe of lunatics, and afterwards retired to the care of his ſiſter at Chicheſter, where death, in 1756, came to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note>.</head>
