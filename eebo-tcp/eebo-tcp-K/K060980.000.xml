            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Explanatory Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is not that I ſee any Reaſon to alter my Opinion in any thing I have Writ, which occaſions this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; but I find it neceſſary for the ſatisfaction of ſome Perſons of Honour, as well as Wit, to paſs a ſhort Explication upon it, and tell the World what I mean, or rather, what I do not mean, in ſome things wherein I find I am liable to be miſ-underſtood.</p>
            <p>I confeſs my ſelf ſomething ſurpriz'd to hear that I am tax'd with Bewraying my Own Neſt, and Abuſing our Nation, by Diſcovering the Meanneſs of our Original, in order to make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> contemptible abroad and at home; in which, I think, they are miſtaken: For why ſhould not our Neighbours be as good as We to Derive from? And I muſt add, That had we been an Unmix'd Nation, I am of Opinion it had been to our Diſadvantage: For to go on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have three Nations about us as clear from Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Blood as any in the World, and I know not which of them I could wiſh our ſelves to be like; I mean the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and if I were to write a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to the <hi>Satyr,</hi> I would examine all the Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and prove, That thoſe Nations which are moſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the beſt, and have leaſt of Barbariſm and Brutality among them; and abundance of Reaſons might be given for it, too long to bring into a <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I give this Hint, to let the World know, that I am far from thinking, 'tis a <hi>Satyr,</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to tell them, They are Deriv'd from all the Nations under Heaven; that is, <hi>from ſeveral Nations</hi> Nor is it meant to undervalue the Original of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for we ſee no Reaſon to like them the worſe, being the Relicks of <hi>Romans, Danes, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> than we ſhoul'd ha' done, if they had remain'd <hi>Britains,</hi> that is, <hi>than if they had been all</hi> Welſhmen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0454100800:3"/>
But the Intent of the <hi>Satyr</hi> is pointed at the Vanity of thoſe who talk of their Antiquity, and value themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Pedigree, their Ancient Families, and being <hi>True Born;</hi> whereas 'tis impoſſible we ſhou'd be <hi>True Born;</hi> and if we could, ſhou'd have loſt by the Bargain.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſort of People, who Call themſelves <hi>True Born,</hi> and tell long Stories of their Families, and like a Nobleman of <hi>Venice, Think a Foreigner ought not to walk on the ſame ſide of the Street with them,</hi> are own'd to be meant in this <hi>Satyr.</hi> What they would infer from their own Original, I know not, nor is it eaſie to make out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are the better, or the worſe for their Anceſtors: Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation may Value themſelves for their <hi>Wit, Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> and I believe few will diſpute it with them; but for long Originals, and Ancient <hi>True Born</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I wou'd adviſe them to wave the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. A <hi>True Engliſh</hi> Man is one that deſerves a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and I have no where leſſened him, that I know of; but as for a <hi>True Born</hi> Engliſh Man, I confeſs I do not underſtand him.</p>
            <p>From hence I only infer, That an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, of all Men ought not to deſpiſe Foreigners <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and I think the Inference is juſt, ſince <hi>what they are to day, we were yeſterday, and to morrow they will be like us.</hi> If Foreigners misbehave in their ſeveral Stations and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>I have nothing to do with that;</hi> the Laws are open to Puniſh them equally with Natives, and let them have no Favour.</p>
            <p>But when I ſee the Town full of Lampoons and Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt <hi>Dutchmen, only becauſe they are Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and the King Reproached and Inſulted by Inſolent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and Ballad-making Poets, for employing Foreigners; and for being a Foreigner himſelf, I confeſs my ſelf mov'd by it to remind our Nation of their own Original, thereby to let them ſee what a Banter is put upon our ſelves in it; ſince ſpeaking of <hi>Engliſhmen ab Origine,</hi> we are really Foreigners our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0454100800:4"/>
I could go on to prove 'tis alſo Impolitick in us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Foreigners; ſince 'tis eaſie to make it appear that the multitudes of Foreign Nations who have took Sanctuary here, have been the greateſt Additions to the Wealth and Strength of the Nation; the great Eſſential whereof is the Number of its Inhabitants: Nor would this Nation have ever arriv'd to the Degree of Wealth and Glory, it now boaſts of, if the addition of Foreign Nations, both as to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and Arms, had not been helpful to it. This is ſo plain, that he who is ignorant of it, is too dull to be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Satyr</hi> therefore I muſt allow to be juſt, till I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe convinc'd; becauſe nothing can be more ridiculous, than to hear our People boaſt of that Antiquity, which if it had been true, would have left us in ſo much worſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than we are in now: Whereas we ought rather to boaſt among our Neighbours, that we are a part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the ſame Original as they, but better'd by our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and like our Language and Manufactures, deriv'd from them, and improv'd by us to a Perfection greater than they can pretend to.</p>
            <p>This we might have valued our ſelves upon without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: But to diſown our Deſcent from them, talking big of our Ancient Families, and long Originals, and ſtand at a diſtance, from Foreigners, like the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> in Religion, with a <hi>Stand off, I am more holy than thou:</hi> This is a thing ſo ridiculous, in a Nation deriv'd from Foreigners, as we are, that I could not but attack them as I have done.</p>
            <p>And whereas I am threaten'd to be call'd to a Publick Account for this Freedom; and the Publiſher of this has been <hi>New-Paper'd</hi> in Goal already for it; tho' I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it for which the Government can be diſpleaſed; yet, if at the ſame time thoſe People who with an Unlimited Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance in Print, every day <hi>Affront the King, Preſcribe the Parliament, and Lampoon the Government,</hi> may be either Puniſhed or Reſtrained, I am content to ſtand and fall by the Publick Juſtice of my Native Countrey, which I am not ſenſible I have any where injur'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0454100800:5"/>
Nor would I be miſ-underſtood concerning the Clergy; with whom if I have taken any Licenſe more than becomes a <hi>Satyr,</hi> I queſtion not but thoſe Gentlemen, who are Men of Letters, are alſo Men of ſo much Candor, as to allow me a Looſe at the Crimes of the Guilty, without thinking the whole Profeſſion Laſh'd, who are Innocent. I profeſs to have very mean Thoughts of thoſe Gentlemen who have deſerted their own Principles, and expos'd even their Morals as well as Loyalty; but not at all to think it affects any but ſuch as are concern'd in the Fact.</p>
            <p>Nor wou'd I be miſ-repreſented as to the Ingratitude of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the King and his Friends; as if I meant the <hi>Engliſh as a Nation,</hi> are ſo. The contrary is ſo apparent, That I wou'd hope it ſhou'd not be Suggeſted of me: And therefore when I have brought in <hi>Britannia</hi> Speaking of the King, I ſuppoſe Her to be the Repreſentative, or Mouth of the Nation, as a Body. But if I ſay we are full of ſuch who daily affront the King, and abuſe his Friends; who Print Scurrilous Pamphlets, Virulent Lampoons, and reproachful Publick Banters, againſt both the King's Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; I ſay nothing but what is too true: And that the <hi>Satyr</hi> is directed at ſuch, I freely own; and cannot ſay, but I ſhou'd think it very hard to be Cenſur'd for this <hi>Satyr,</hi> while ſuch remain <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nqueſtion'd, and tacitly approv'd. That I can mean none but ſuch, is plain ftom theſe few Lines.
<q>
                  <l>Ye Heavens regard! Almighty <hi>Jove,</hi> look down,</l>
                  <l>And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne.</l>
                  <l>On their Ungrateful Heads due Vengeance take,</l>
                  <l>Who ſought his Aid, and then his Part forſake.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If I have fallen upon our Vices, I hope none but the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will be Angery. As for Writing for Intereſt, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it; I have neither <hi>Place,</hi> nor <hi>Penſion,</hi> nor <hi>Proſpect;</hi> nor <hi>ſeek none,</hi> nor will <hi>have none:</hi> If matter of Fact juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Truth of the Crimes, the <hi>Satyr</hi> is Juſt. As to the Poetick Liberties, I hope the Crime is Pardonable: I am
<pb facs="tcp:0454100800:6"/>
content to be Ston'd, provided none will Attack me but the Innocent.</p>
            <p>If my Country-Men wou'd take the Hint, and grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Natur'd from my <hi>ill-Natur'd Poem,</hi> as ſome call it; I would ſay this of it, that tho' 'tis far from the beſt <hi>Satyr</hi> that ever was Wrote, 'twould do the moſt Good that ever <hi>Satyr</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And yet I am ready to ask Pardon of ſome Gentlemen too; who tho' they are <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> have good Nature enough to ſee themſelves Reprov'd, and can bear it. Theſe are Gentlemen in a true Sence, that can bear to be told of their <hi>Faux Pas,</hi> and not abuſe the Reprover. To ſuch I muſt ſay, this is no <hi>Satyr;</hi> they are Exceptions to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule; and I value my Performance from their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Approbation, more than I can from any Opinion I have of its Worth.</p>
            <p>The haſty Errors of my Verſe I made my Excuſe for, before; and ſince the time I have been upon it has been but little, and my Leiſure leſs, I have all along ſtrove rather to make the Thoughts Explicite, than the Poem Correct. However, I have mended ſome Faults in this Edition, <hi>and the reſt muſt be plac'd to my Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to Anſwers, Banters, <hi>True Engliſh Billinſgate,</hi> I expect them till no Body will buy, and then the Shop will be ſhut. Had I wrote it for the Gain of the Preſs, I ſhould have been concern'd at its being Printed again and again, by <hi>Pyrates,</hi> as they call them, and <hi>Paragraph-Men:</hi> But would They but do it Juſtice, and Print it True, according to the Copy, they are welcome to Sell it for a Penny, if they Pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Pence indeed is the End of their Works. I'll engage, if no body will Buy, no body will Write: And not a Patriot-Poet of them all, now will in Defence of his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>which I have abus'd, they ſay,</hi> Print an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it, and give it about for <hi>Gods-ſake.</hi>

               <p>I expect a Storm of Ill-Language from the Fury of the Town, and eſpecially from thoſe whoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Talent it is to Rail: And without being taken for a Conjurer, I may venture to foretell, That I ſhall be Cavil'd at about my <hi>Mean Stile, Rough Verſe,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct Language;</hi> things I might indeed have taken more Care in; But the Book is Printed; and tho' I ſee ſome Faults, 'tis too late to mend them: And this is all I think needful to ſay to them.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly ſome body may take me for a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> in which they are miſtaken: But I am one that would be glad to ſee <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> behave themſelves better to Strangers, and to Governours alſo; that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries for belonging to a <hi>Nation that wants Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I aſſure you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Strangers uſe us better Abroad; and we can give no reaſon but our Ill-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the contrary here.</p>
               <p>Methinks an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who is ſo Proud of being call'd <hi>A Goodfellow,</hi> ſhou'd be Civil: And it cannot be deny'd but we are in many Caſes, and particularly to Strangers, the Churliſheſt People alive.</p>
               <p>As to Vices, who can diſpute our <hi>Intemperance,</hi> while an <hi>Honeſt</hi> Drunken Fellow is a Character in a
<pb facs="tcp:0454100800:8"/>
Mans Praiſe? All our Reformations are Banters, and will be ſo, till our Magiſtrates and Gentry Reform themſelves by way of Example; then, and not till then, they may be expected to Puniſh others without Bluſhing.</p>
               <p>As to our <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> I deſire to be underſtood of that particular People, who pretending to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King <hi>James</hi> and his Popiſh Powers: Together, with ſuch who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the preſent Government, and yet abuſe and affront the King, who procur'd it, and openly profeſs their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs under him: Theſe, by whatſoever Names or Titles they are dignified, or diſtinguiſh'd, are the People aim'd at: Nor do I diſown, but that it is ſo much the Temper of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to abuſe his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, that I could be glad to ſee it rectified.</p>
               <p>They who think I have been Guilty of any Error, in expoſing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to themſelves, may among many honeſt Inſtances of the like Nature, find the ſame thing in Mr. <hi>Cowely,</hi> in his Imitation of the ſecond Olympick Ode of <hi>Pindar:</hi> His Words are theſe,<q>
                     <l>But in this Thankleſs World, the Givers</l>

                     <l>'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Faſhion,</l>
                     <l>Rather to hide than pay an Obligation.</l>
                     <l>Nay, 'tis much worſe than ſo;</l>

               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p>NO Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Faults, but he that has none of his own, <hi>ſay ſome People, who are loth to be told of their Errours;</hi> and 'tis on this Account only, that the World has the Trouble of a <hi>Preface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that be true, the Author freely acknowledges he is the moſt unqualified Man in the World to reprove.</p>
               <p>That no Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Crimes, who allows himſelf in the Practice of the ſame, is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted, and is the very Subſtance and Foundation of the following <hi>Satyr:</hi> And on that ſcore, the Author has as good a Title to Animadverſion as another, ſince no Man can charge him with the Vices he has reproved.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of Self-defence, he is rather willing to look back on the beſt Actions of his Life, with the Temper of a Penitent, and he wiſhes all Men wou'd do the like; 'tis the only way to make the <hi>Satyr</hi> Impertinent.<q>
                     <l>For Penitence would all his Verſe diſarm,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Satyr</hi>'s anſwer'd if the Men reform.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the Fact is not true neither: 'Tis a very pretty way for Men to get rid of the Impertinence of Admonition. If
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0454100800:63"/>
none but faultleſs Men muſt reprove others, the Lord ha' Mercy upon all our Magiſtrates; and all our Clergy are undignified and ſuſpended at a Blow.</p>
               <p>Nor does the <hi>Satyr</hi> aſſault private Infirmity, or purſue Perſonal Vices; but is bent at thoſe, who pretending to ſuppreſs Vice, or being veſted with Authority for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet make themſelves the Shame of their Country, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Wickedneſs by that very Authority they have to ſuppreſs it.</p>
               <p>He profeſſes himſelf ſorry, either that Freedom of Speech is ſo dangerous in this Age, or that he is too much a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; otherwiſe, ſome had heard of their Crimes who think themſelves above the Power of Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>'Tis hard that Vice ſhould have ſo much ſhelter from Civil Power, that Reproof ſhou'd lead the Party to ſuppreſs the Poet rather than the Crime.</p>
               <p>And yet his Friends give him over for loſt: An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he has ventur'd to ſay, to whoſe Importunity he thinks himſelf oblig'd to anſwer with <hi>Juvenal,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Difficile eſt Satyram non ſcribere. Nam quis Iniquae</l>
                     <l>Tam Patiens Urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat ſe?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If any Man is injur'd by the Characters, he is content they ſhould carry their Reſentment to what Extremity they pleaſe; but if Truth may be on his ſide, the only way to make him do them Juſtice is to reform: And he promiſes to give Teſtimony to their Repentance, <hi>as an Amand Honourable,</hi> in a manner as publick as poſſible.</p>

               <head>The PREFACE.</head>
               <p>REformation of Manners is a Work ſo Honourable, and at this Time ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that like the Reform of our Money it can be no longer delay'd.</p>
               <p>The Ways by which the preſent Torrent of Vice has been let in upon the Nation, and by which it maintains the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny it has uſurp'd on the Lives of the Inhabitants, are too plain to be hid. The following Sheets aim at the Work, by leading to the moſt direct means, <hi>Viz.</hi> Reformation by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Laws are, <hi>in Terrorem</hi> Puniſhments, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Compel and put a Force upon Mens Minds; but Example is Perſwaſive and Gentle, and draws by a Secret, Inviſible, and almoſt Involuntary Power.</p>
               <p>If there can be any Remedies propoſed more proper to bring it to paſs, they that know them would do well to bring them forth. In the mean time the Author thinks Conſcience in the Minds of Men Impartially Conſulted, will give a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum eſt</hi> to the following Propoſal; and to that Judgment be refers all thoſe who Object againſt it.</p>

               <head>THE The Poor Man's PLEA.</head>
               <p>IN ſearching for a proper Cure of an Epidemick Diſtemper, Phyſicians do tell us 'tis firſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to know the Cauſe of that Diſtemper, from what Part of the Body, and from what ill Habit it proceeds; and when the Cauſe is diſcover'd, it is to be removed, that the Effect may ceaſe of its ſelf; but if removing the Cauſe will not work the Cure, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they proceed to apply proper Remedies to the Diſeaſe it ſelf, and the particular Part afflicted.</p>
               <p>Immorality is without doubt the preſent reigning Diſtemper of the Nation: And the King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, who are indeed the proper Phyſicians, ſeem nobly inclin'd to undertake the Cure. 'Tis a Great Work, well worthy their utmoſt Pains: The Honour of it, were it once perfected, would add more Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies to the <hi>Crown,</hi> than all the Victories of <hi>this Bloody War,</hi> or the Glories of <hi>this Honourable Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as a Perſon under the Violence of a Diſeaſe ſends in vain for a Phyſician, unleſs he reſolves to make uſe of his Preſcription; ſo in vain does the King attempt to reform a Nation, unleſs they are willing to reform themſelves, and to ſubmit to his Preſcriptions.</p>
               <p>Wickedneſs is an Ancient Inhabitant in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and 'tis very hard to give its Original.</p>
               <p>But however difficult that may be, 'tis eaſy to look back to a time when we were not ſo generally infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Vice as we are now; and 'twill ſeem ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to enquire into the Cauſes of our preſent Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtant Religion ſeems to have an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Title</hi> to the firſt introducing a ſtrict Morality
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0454100800:113"/>
mong us; and 'tis but juſt to give the Honour of it, where 'tis ſo eminently due. Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners has ſomething of a Natural Conſequence in it from Reformation in Religion For ſince the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion diſown the Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiff, by which a thouſand Sins are, <hi>as Venial Crimes,</hi> bought off, and the Prieſt, to <hi>ſave God Almighty the trouble,</hi> can blot them out of the Account before it comes to his hand; common Vices loſt their Charter, and men could not ſin at ſo cheap a Rate as before. The Proteſtant Religion has in it ſelf a Natural Tendency to Virtue, as a ſtanding Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of its own Divine Original, and accordingly it has ſuppreſs'd Vice and Immorality in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where it has had a Footing: It has civiliz'd Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reform'd the very <hi>Tempers</hi> of its Profeſſors: Chriſtianity and Humanity has gone hand in hand in the World; and there is ſo viſible a difference between the other Civiliz'd Governments in the World, and thoſe who now are under the Proteſtant Powers, that it carries its Evidence in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Reformation, begun in <hi>England</hi> in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and afterwards gloriouſly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> brought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch a degree of Humanity, and Sobriety of Converſation, as we have reaſon to doubt will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeen again in our Age.</p>
               <p>In King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's time, the Court affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething more of Gallantry and Gaiety, Luxury got footing; and twenty Years Peace, together with no extraordinary Examples from the Court, gave too great Encouragement to Licentiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>If it took footing in King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's time, it took a deep Root in the Reign of his Son; and the Liberty given the Soldiery in the Civil War, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd all manner of Prophanneſs throughout the Kingdom. That Prince, tho' very Pious in his own
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0454100800:114"/>
Perſon and Practice and had the Misfortune to be the firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> and perhaps in the World, that ever eſtabliſh'd Wickedneſs by a Law: By what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Council, or ſecret ill Fate he was guided to it, is hard to determine; but the <hi>Book of Sports,</hi> as it was called, that Book to tolerate the Exerciſe of all Sports and Paſtimes on the Lord's-Day, tended more to the vitiating the Practice of this Kingdom, <hi>as to keeping that Day,</hi> than all the Acts of Parliament, Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Endeavours of future Princes has done, or ever will do, to reform it.</p>
               <p>And yet the People of <hi>England</hi> expreſs'd a general ſort of an Averſion to that Liberty; <hi>and ſome,</hi> as if glutted with too much Freedom, when the Reins of Law were taken off, refuſed that Practice they allow'd themſelves in before.</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, Lewdneſs and all manner of Debauchcry arriv'd to its Meridian: The Encouragement it had from the Practice and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Court, is an invincible Demonſtration how far the Influence of our Government extends in the Practice of the People.</p>
               <p>The preſent King and his late Queen, whoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Memory will be dear to the Nation as long as the World ſtands, have had all this wicked Knot to unravel. This was the firſt thing the Queen ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on while the King was engaged in his Wars abroad: She firſt gave all ſorts of Vice a general Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and on the contrary, rais'd the value of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Sobriety by her Royal Example. The King having brought the War to a Glorious Concluſion, and ſettled an Honourable Peace, in his very firſt Speech to his <hi>Parliament</hi> proclaims a New War againſt <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> and goes on alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the practice of it by his Royal Example.</p>
               <p>Thus the Work is begun nobly and regularly; and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the General Repreſentative of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0454100800:115"/>
follows this Royal Example, in enacting Laws to ſuppreſs all manner of Prophaneneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are Great Things, and, well-improv'd, would give an undoubted Overthrow to to the Tyranny of Vice, and the Dominion <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> has uſurp'd in the hearts of Men.</p>
               <p>But we of the <hi>Plebeii</hi> find our ſelves juſtly aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all this Work of Reformation; and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Rigor makes the real Work impoſſible: Wherefore we find our ſelves forced to ſeek Redreſs of our Grievances in the old honeſt way of Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven to relieve us: And in the mean time, we ſolemnly Enter our <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt the Vicious part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation; as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We Proteſt, That we do not find, impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquiring into the matter, ſpeaking of Moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that you are not one jot better than we are, <hi>your Dignities, Eſtates, and Quality excepted.</hi> 'Tis true, we are all bad enough, and we are willing in good Manners to agree, that we are as wicked as you; but we cannot find, on the exacteſt Scrutiny, but that in the Commonwealth of Vice, the Devil has taken care to level Poor and Rich into one Claſs, and is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going on to make us all Graduates in the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Immorality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> We do not find that all the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Declarations, and Acts of Parliament yet made, have any <hi>effective Power</hi> to puniſh <hi>you</hi> for your Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, as it does <hi>us.</hi> Now while <hi>you</hi> make Laws to puniſh <hi>us,</hi> and let <hi>your ſelves</hi> go free, tho' guilty of the ſame Vices and Immoralities, thoſe Laws are unjuſt and unequal in themſelves.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the Laws do not expreſs a Liberty to <hi>you,</hi> and a Puniſhment to <hi>us;</hi> and therefore the King and Parliament are free, as King and Parliament, from this our Appeal; but the Gentry and Magiſtrates of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0454100800:116"/>
Kingdom, while they execute thoſe Laws upon us the poor Commons, and themſelves practiſing the ſame Crimes, in defiance of the Laws both of God and Man, go unpuniſh'd; <hi>This</hi> is the Grievance we proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as unjuſt and unequal.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, till the Nobility, Gentry, Juſtices of the Peace, and Clergy, will be pleaſed either to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their own Manners, and ſuppreſs their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, or find out ſome method and Power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to puniſh themſelves when guilty, we Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave Leave to Object againſt ſetting any Poor Man in the Stocks, or ſending them to the Houſe of Correction for Immoralities, as the moſt unequal and unjuſt way of proceeding in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now Gentlemen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this Proteſtation may not ſeem a little too Rude, and a Breach of Good Manners to our Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, ws crave Leave to ſubjoin our Humble Appeal to your ſelves; and will for once, knowing you as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen to be Men of Honour, <hi>make you Judges in your own Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Gentlemen, We appeal to your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever it be likely to perfect the Reformation of Manners in this Kingdom, without you; Whether Laws to puniſh us, without your Example alſo to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence us, will ever bring the Work to paſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt Step from a looſe vicious Practice in this Nation was begun by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, backt by a Reform'd Clergy, and a Sober Nobility: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> carried it on: 'Twas the Kings and the Gentry which firſt again Degenerated from that ſtrict Obſervation of Moral Virtues, and from thence carried Vice on to that degree it now appears in. From the Court Vice took its <hi>Progreſs</hi> into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and in the Families of the Gentry and Nobility it harbour'd, till it took heart under their <hi>Protection,</hi> and made a general Salley into the Nation; and We
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0454100800:117"/>
the poor Commons, who have been always eaſy to be guided by the Example of our Landlords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have really been debauch'd into Vice by their Examples: And it muſt be the <hi>Example of you the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry of the Kingdom,</hi> that muſt put a Stop to the Flood of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> which is broken in upon the Country, or it will never be done.</p>
               <p>Our Laws againſt all manner of Vicious <hi>Practices</hi> are already very ſevere: But Laws are uſeleſs inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant things, if the Executive <hi>Power</hi> which lies in the Magiſtrate be not exerted. The Juſtices of the <hi>Peace</hi> have the power to puniſh, but if they do not put forth that power, 'tis all one as if they had none at all: Some have poſſibly exerted this power; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it has been ſo put forth, it has fallen upon us the poor Commons: Theſe are all Cobweb Laws, in which the ſmall Flies are catch'd, and great ones break thro'. My Lord Mayor has whipt about the poor Beggars, and a few ſcandalous Whores have been ſent to the Houſe of Correction; ſome Alehouſe-keepers and Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have been fin'd for drawing Drink on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day; but all this falls upon us of the Mob, the poor <hi>Plebeii,</hi> as if all the Vice lay among us; for we do not find the Rich Drunkard carri'd before my Lord Mayor, nor a Swearing Lewd <hi>Merchant. The man with a Gold Ring and Gay Cloaths,</hi> may Swear before the Juſtice, or at the Juſtice; may reel home through the open Streets, and no man take any notice of it; but if a poor man get drunk, or ſwears an Oath, he muſt to the Stocks without Remedy.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, We appeal to your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws or <hi>Proclamations</hi> are capable of having any Effect towards a Reformation of <hi>Manners,</hi> while the Benches of our Juſtices are infected with the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vices of Swearing and Drunkenneſs; while our Juſtices themſelves ſhall puniſh a man for Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a <hi>God damn him, ſet him in the Stocks:</hi> And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0454100800:118"/>
if Laws and Proclamations are uſeleſs in the Caſe, then they are good for nothing, and had as good be let alone as publiſh'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis hard, Gentlemen, to be puniſh'd for a Crime, by a man as guilty as our ſelves; and that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure a man makes in the World, muſt be the reaſon why he ſhall not be liable to the Law: This is really puniſhing men for being poor, which is no Crime at all; as a Thief may be ſaid to ſaid to be hang'd, not for the Fact, but for being taken.</p>
               <p>We further appeal to your ſelves, Gentlemen, to inform us, whether there be any particular reaſon why you ſhould be allow'd the full Career of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Appetites, without the Reſtraint of Laws, while you your ſelves agree that ſuch Offences ſhall be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in us, and do really execute the Law upon the Poor People, when brought before you for the ſame things.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that the Work of Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may go on, and be brought to Perfection, to the Glory of God, and the great Honour of the King and Parliament: That Debauchery and Prophaneſs, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Whoring, and all ſorts of Immoralities may be ſuppreſs'd, we humbly propoſe the Method which may effectually accompliſh ſo great a Work.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That the Gentry and Clergy, who are the Leaders of us poor ignorant people, and our Lights erected on high places to Guide and Govern us, would in the firſt place put a voluntary Force upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and effectually reform their own Lives, their way of converſing, and their common Behaviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Servants and Neighbours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Gentry. They are the Original of the Modes, and Cuſtoms, and Manners of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and their examples in <hi>the Countries eſpecially</hi> are very moving. There are three ſeveral Vices, which have the principal Mannagement of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0454100800:119"/>
part of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> Drunkenneſs, Swearing, and Whoring; all of them very ill becoming a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, however Cuſtom may have made them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh: Where none of theſe Three are in a Houſe, there is certainly ſomething of a Plantation of God in the Family; for they are ſuch Epidemic Diſtempers, that hardly Humane Nature is entirely free from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Drunkenneſs that Brutiſh Vice; a Sin ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, and ſo much a Force upon Nature, that had God Almighty enjoyn'd it as a Duty, I believe many a Man would have ventur'd the loſs of Heaven, rather than have have perform'd it. The <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of it ſeems to be ſo ſecretly hid, that wild Heathen Nations know nothing of the matter; 'tis only diſcover'd, by the wiſe people of theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, who are <hi>Proficients</hi> in Vice, <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in Wickedneſs, who can extract a Pleaſure to themſelves in loſing their Underſtanding, and make themſelves Sick at Heart for their Diverſion.</p>
               <p>If the Hiſtory of this well bred Vice was to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, 'twould plainly appear that it begun among the Gentry, and from them was handed down to the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort, who ſtill love to be like their Betters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſtitution of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when drinking the King's Health became the diſtinction between a <hi>Cavalier</hi> and a <hi>Roundhead,</hi> Drunkenneſs <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan its Reign,</hi> and it has Reign'd almoſt Forty Years: The Gentry careſs'd this Beaſtly Vice at ſuch a Rate, that no Companion, no Servant was thought proper unleſs he could bear a Quantity of Wine: and to this Day 'tis added to the Character of a Man, as an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Title, when you would ſpeak well of him, <hi>He is an Honeſt Drunken Fellow;</hi> as if his Drunkenneſs was a Recommendation of his Honeſty. From the practice of this naſty Faculty, our Gentlemen have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0454100800:120"/>
arriv'd to the teaching of it; and that it might be effectually preſerv'd to the next Age, have very early inſtructed the Youth in it. Nay, ſo far has Cuſtom prevail'd, that the Top of a Gentleman's Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been to make his Friend Drunk; and the Friend is ſo much reconcil'd to it, that he takes that for the effect of his Kindneſs, which he ought as much to be affronted at, as if he had kick'd him down Stairs: Thus 'tis become a Science: and but that the Inſtruction proves ſo eaſie, and the Youth too apt to learn, poſſibly we might have had a Colledge erected for it before now. The further Perfection of this Vice among the Gentry, will appear in two things; that 'tis become the Subject of their Glory, and the way of expreſſing their Joy for any publick Bleſſing. <hi>Jack,</hi> ſaid a Gentleman of very high Quality, when after the Debate in the Houſe of Lords, K. <hi>William</hi> was Voted into the Vacant Throne; <hi>Jack</hi> (ſays he) <hi>God damn ye,</hi> Jack, <hi>go home to your Lady, and tell her we have got a Proteſtant King and Queen; and go make a Bonfire as big as a Houſe, and bid the Butler make ye all Drunk, ye Dog:</hi> Here was ſacrificing to the Devil, for a Thankſgiving to God. Other Vices are committed as Vices, and Men act them in private, and are willing to hide them; but Drunkenneſs they are ſo fond of, that they will glory in it, boaſt of it, and endeavour to promote it as much as poſſible in others: 'Tis a Triumph to a Champion of the Bottle, to repeat how many Quarts of Wine he has Drank at a ſitting, and how he made ſuch and ſuch Honeſt Fellows Drunk. Men <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>Forſwear,</hi> and <hi>hide it,</hi> and are <hi>aſham'd of it,</hi> as indeed they have reaſon to do: But Drunkenneſs and Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring are Accompliſhments Men begin to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon, repeat them with Pleaſure, and affect a ſort of Vanity in the Hiſtory; are content all the world ſhould be Witneſſes of their Intemperance, and have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0454100800:121"/>
made the Crime a Badge of Honour to their Breeding and introduce the practice as a Faſhion. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gives himſelf the Trouble to Reflect on the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of our Gentlemen in their Families, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and promoting this Vice of Drunkenneſs, among the poor Commons, will not think it a Scandal upon the Geutry of <hi>England,</hi> if we ſay, That the Mode of Drinking, as 'tis now practiſed, had its Original from the Practice of the Country-Gentlemen, and they again from the Court.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, and God forbid it ſhould not, That there are a great many of our Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who are Men of Honour and Men of Morals, and therefore this Charge is not univerſal. To which we anſwer, Tis univerſal for all that; becauſe thoſe very Gentlemen, tho' they are negatively clear as to the Commiſſion of the Crimes we ſpeak of, yet are poſitively guilty, in not executing that Power the Law has put into their hands, with an Impartial Vigour. For where was that Gentleman or Juſtice of the Peace ever yet found, who executed the Terms of the Law upon a Drunken, Swearing, Lewd Gentleman, his Neighbour, but the Quality of the Perſon has been a Licenſe to the open Exerciſe of the worſt Crimes; as if there were any Baronets, Knights, or Squires in the next World; who becauſe of thoſe little ſteps Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om had raiſed them on, higher than their Neighbours, ſhould be exempted from the Divine Judicature; or that, as Captain <hi>Vratz</hi> ſaid, who was Hang'd for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th'ring Eſquire <hi>Thynn, God would ſhow them ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as they were Gentlemen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there were any reaſon why a Rich Man ſhould be permitted in the publick Exerciſe of Open Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, and not the poor Man, ſomething might be ſaid: But if there be any difference it lies the other way; for the Vices of a poor Man affect only himſelf; but the Rich Man's Wickedneſs affects all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0454100800:122"/>
gives offence to the Sober, and encourages and hardens the Lewd, and quite overthrows the weak Reſolutions of ſuch as are but indifferently fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Virtue and Morality. If my own Watch goes falſe, it deceives me and none elſe; but if the Town Clock goes falſe, it deceives the whole Pariſh. The Gentry are the Leaders of the Mob; if they are Lewd and Drunken, the others ſtrive to imitate 'em; if they Diſcourage Vice and Intemperance, the other will not be ſo forward in it, nor ſo fond of it.</p>
               <p>To think then to effect a Reformation by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poor, while the Rich ſeem to Enjoy a Charter for Wickedneſs, is like <hi>taking away the Effect, that the Cauſe may ceaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find ſome People very fond of Monopolizing a Vice, they would have all of it to themſelves; they muſt, as my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Sin like a Lord;</hi> little ſneaking Sins won't ſerve turn; but they muſt be Lewd at a rate above the Common Size, to let the World ſee they are capable of it.</p>
               <p>Our Laws ſeem to take no Cognizance of ſuch, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made no Law againſt <hi>Parricide,</hi> becauſe he would not have the Sin named among his Citizens.</p>
               <p>Now the poor Man ſees no ſuch Dignity in Vice, as to ſtudy Degrees; we are down-right in Wickedneſs, as we are in our Dealings; if we are Drunk, 'tis plain Drunkenneſs; Swearing, and Whoring, is all Blunderbus with us; we don't affect ſuch Niceties in our Converſation; and the Juſtices uſe us accordingly; nothing but the Stocks, or the Houſe of Correction is the Caſe, when we are brought before them; but when our Maſters the Gentlemen come to their Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Practice, and Sin by the Rules of Quality, we do not find any thing come of it but falſe Heraldry, the Vice is puniſh'd by the Vice, and the Puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the Crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0454100800:123"/>
The Caſe in ſhort is this; the Lewdneſs, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Immorality of the Gentry, which is the main Cauſe of the General Debauchery of the Kingdom is not at all toucht by our Laws, as they are now Executed; and while it remains ſo, the Reformation of Manners can never be brought to paſs, nor Prophaneneſs and Immorality Suppreſs'd; and therefore the puniſhing the Poor diſtinctly, is a Mock upon the good Deſigns of the King and Parliament; an Act of Injuſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to puniſh them, and let others as guilty go free; and a ſort of Cruelty too, in taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Poverty to make them ſuffer, becauſe they want Eſtates to purchaſe their Exemption.</p>
               <p>We have ſome weak Excuſes for this Matters, which muſt be conſidered: As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Juſtice of the Peace is a <hi>Paſſive Magiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> till an Information be brought before him, and is not to take notice of any thing, but as it is laid in Fact, and brought to an Affidavit. Now if an Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit be made before a Juſtice, that ſuch or ſuch a man Swore, or was Drunk, he muſt, or cannot avoid Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him; the Law obliges him to it, let his Quality be what it will; ſo that the Defect is not in the Law, nor in the Juſtice, but in the want of Information.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Name of an Evidence or Informer is ſo ſcandalous, that to attempt to inform againſt a Man for the moſt open Breach of the Laws of Morality, is enough to denominate a man unfit for Society; a Rogue and an Informer are Synonimous in the Vulgar Acceptation; ſo much is the real Detection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneſt Crimes againſt God, and Civil Government, Diſcouraged and Avoided.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Impoſſibility of the Cure is ſuch, and the Habit has ſo obtain'd upon all Mankind, that it ſeems twiſted with Human Nature, as an Appendix to Natural Frailty, which it is impoſſible to ſeparate from it:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0454100800:124"/>
                  <hi>For Anſwer:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis true, the Juſtice of the Peace is in ſome reſpect a <hi>Paſſive Magiſtrate,</hi> and does not act but by Information, but ſuch Information would be brought if it were encouraged; if Juſtices of of the Peace did acquaint themſelves with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, they would ſoon hear of the Immoralities of the Pariſh; and if they did impartially Execute the Law on ſuch as offended, without reſpect of Perſons they would ſoon have an Account of the Perſons and Circumſtances. Beſides, 'tis not want of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but want of puniſhing what they have Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of. A Poor Man informs againſt a Great Man, the Witneſs is diſcouraged, the Man goes unpuniſh'd, and the Poor Man gets the Scandal of an Informer; and then 'tis but too often that our Juſtices are not Men of extraordinary Morals themſelves; and who ſhall Inform a Juſtice of the Peace that ſuch a Man Swore, when he may be heard to Swear himſelf as faſt as another? Or who ſhall bring a Man before a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for being Drunk, when the Juſtice is ſo Drunk himſelf, he cannot order him to be ſet in the Stocks?</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Beſides, the Juſtice has a Power to puniſh any Fact he himſelf ſees committed, and to enquire into any he hears of caſually: and if he will ſtand ſtill and ſee thoſe Acts of Immorality committed before his Face, who ſhall bring a Poor Man before him to be puniſhed? Thus I have heard a Thouſand horrid Oaths Sworn on a Bowling-Green, in the preſence of a Juſtice of the Peace, and he take no Notice of it, and go home the next hour, and ſet a Man in the Stocks for being Drunk.</p>
               <p>As to the Scandal of Informing, <hi>'tis an Error in Cuſtom,</hi> and a great Sin againſt Juſtice; 'tis neceſſary indeed that all Judgment ſhould be according to Evidence, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourage Evidence is to diſcourage Juſtice; but that a Man in Trial of the Morality of his Neighbour, ſhould be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0454100800:125"/>
ſhamed to appear, muſt have ſome particular cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It proceeds from the Modiſhneſs of the Vice; it has ſo obtain'd upon ſome Men Mens Practices, that to appear againſt what almoſt all Men approve, ſeems malicious, and has a certain proſpect either of Revenge or of a Mercenary Wretch, that Informs meerly to get a Reward. 'Tis true, if no Reward be plac'd upon an Information, no Man will take the trouble; and again, if too great a Reward, Men of Honour ſhun the thing, becauſe they ſcorn the Fee, and to inform meerly for the Fee has ſomething of a Raſcal in it too; and from theſe reaſons ariſes the Backwardneſs of the People.</p>
               <p>The very ſame Rich Men we ſpeak of are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who diſcourage the Diſcovery of Vice by ſcandalizing the Informer; a Man that is any thing of a Gentleman ſcorns it, and the Poor ſtill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick the Humour of the Rich, and hate an Informer as they do the Devil, 'Tis ſtrange the Gentlemen ſhould be aſham'd to detect the Breach of thoſe Laws, which they were not aſham'd to make; but the very Name of an Informer has gain'd ſo black an Idea in the minds People, becauſe ſome have made a Trade of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt People for Religion, have misbehaved themſelves, that truly 'twill be hard to bring any Man either of Credit or Quality to attempt it.</p>
               <p>But the main thing which makes our Gentlemen backward in the proſecution of Vice, is their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſame Crimes themſelves, and they have ſo much wicked Modeſty and Generoſity in them, being really no Enemies to the thing it ſelf, that they cannot with any ſort of Freedom puniſh in others what they practice themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the Times of Executing the Laws againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, we found a great many Gentlemen very Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in Proſecuting their Neighbours; they did not ſtick to appear in Perſon to diſturb <hi>Meetings,</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0454100800:126"/>
demoliſh the <hi>Meeting-Houſes,</hi> and rather than fail, would be Informers themſelves; the reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had alſo a diſlike to the thing; but we never found a Diſſenting Gentleman, or Juſtice of the Peace forward to do thus, becauſe they approved of it. Now were our Gentlemen and Magiſtrates real Enemies to the Immoralities of this Age, did they really hate Drunkenneſs as a Vice, they would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and zealous to root the practice of it out of the Neighbourhood, they would not be backward or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to detect Vice, to diſturb Drunken Aſſemblies, to diſperſe thoſe Plantations of Leachery, the Publick Bawdy Houſes, which are almoſt as openly allowed as the <hi>Burdelloes</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> They would be willing to have all ſorts of Vices Suppreſs'd, and glory in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hands to the Work; they would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to appear in the detecting Debauchery, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to embroil themſelves with their Rich Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. 'Tis Guilt of the ſame Fact which makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance, and till that guilt be removed, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>England</hi> neither will or can indeed with any kind of Honour put their hands to the Reforming it in their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>But I think 'tis eaſie to make it appear that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Informing may be removed, and there need not be much occaſion for that Scandalous Employment.</p>
               <p>'Tis in the power of the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the whole Kingdom without either Laws, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, or Informers; and without their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, all the Laws, Proclamations, and Declarations in the World will have no Effect; the Vigour of the Laws conſiſts in their Executive Power: Ten thouſand Acts of Parliament ſignifie no more than One ſingle Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs the Gentlemen in whoſe hands the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Laws is placed, take care to ſee them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of; and how can Laws be duly Executed-but by an impartial Diſtribution of equal Rewards,

and Puniſhments, without Regard to the Quality and Degree of the Perſons? The Laws puſh on the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices now, and they take care to go no faſter than they are driven; but would the Juſtices puſh on the Laws, Vice would fly before them, as Duſt in the Wind, and Immoralities would be ſoon ſuppreſs'd; but it can never be expected that the Magiſtrates ſhould puſh on the Laws to a free Suppreſſion of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, till they Reform themſelves, and their Great Neighbours Reform themſelves, that there may be none to Puniſh, who are too big for the Magiſtrate to venture upon,</p>
               <p>Would the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> decry the Modiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Vice by their own Practice; would they but daſh it ouf of Countenance by diſowning it; that Drunkenneſs and Oaths might once come into <hi>dife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,</hi> and be out of Faſhion, and a Man be valued the leſs for them; that he that will Swear, and be Drunk, ſhall be counted a Rake, and not fit for a Gentleman's Company. This would do more to Reforming the reſt of Mankind than all the Puniſhments the Law can inflict; the Evil encreaſed by Example, and muſt be Suppreſs'd the the ſame way. If the Gentry were thus Reform'd, their Families would be ſo too: No Servant would be Entertain'd, no Workman Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no Shopkeeper would be Traded with by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, but ſuch as like themſelves, were ſober and honeſt; a Lewd Vicious Drunken Footman muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or Starve, he would get no Service; a Servant once turn'd away for his Intemperance would be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by no Body elſe; a Swearing Debauch'd Labourer or Workman muſt Reform, or no Body would Employ him; the Drunken Whoring Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper muſt grow Sober, or loſe all his Cuſtomers, and be undone. Intereſt and Good Manners will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the poorer ſort, there would be no need of the Stocks or Houſes of Correction; we ſhould be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0454100800:128"/>
Sober of Courſe, becauſe we ſhould be all Beggars elſe; and he that loved the Vice ſo dearly as to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it with the loſs of his Trade and Employment, would ſoon grow too Poor for his Vice, and be forc'd to leave it by his own Neceſſities; there would be no need of Informers, a Vicious Fellow would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Notorious, he would be the Talk of the Town, every one wou'd ſlight and ſhun him for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought like him, by being ſeen in his Company: he would Expoſe himſelf, and would be Puniſh'd as unpitied as a Thief.</p>
               <p>So that in ſhort, the whole Weight of this Bleſſed Work of Reformation, lies on the Shoulders of the Gentry; they are the cauſe of our Defection, which being taken away, the Effect would ceaſe of Courſe, Vice would grow Scandalous, and all Mankind would be aſham'd of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>'Tis a ſtrange thing how it ſhould be otherwiſe than it is with us the poor Commonalty, when the Gentry our Pattern, and the Clergy our Teachers are as Immoral as we. And then to conſider the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the thing; <hi>the Parſon preaches a thundering Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon againſt Drunkenneſs, and the Juſtice of Peace ſets my poor Neighbour in the Stocks, and I am like to be much the better for either, when I know perhaps that this ſame Parſon and this ſame Juſtice were both Drunk together the Night before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be true, for ought we know, that a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parſon may make a good Sermon; and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb may be true of the Soul as well as the Body, <hi>If the Cure be but wrought, let the Devil be the Doctor;</hi> but this does not take with the down-right ignorant

People in the Country; a poor Man gets Drunk in a Country Ale Houſe, <hi>Why, are you not aſham'd to be ſuch a Beaſt, ſays a good honeſt Neighbour to him the next day?</hi> Aſham'd, ſays the Fellow! Why ſhould I be aſham'd? Why, there was Sir <hi>John —</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert —</hi> and the Parſon, and they were all as Drunk as I. And why a Beaſt, Pray? I heard Sir <hi>Robert —</hi> ſay, That

               </p>
               <p>A Vicious Parſon that preaches well, but lives ill, may be like an unskilful Horſeman, who opens a Gate on the wrong ſide, and lets other Folks through, but ſhuts himſelf out. This may be poſſible, but it ſeems moſt reaſonable to think they are a means by that ſort of living, to hinder both themſelves and others; and would the Gentry and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> but look back on the Guilt that really lies on them, as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by whoſe Example ſo great a part of Mankind has been led into, and encouraged in the Progreſs of Vice, they would find Matter of very ſerious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Article of the Clergy may ſeem to lie in the Power of their Superiors to rectify, and therefore may be ſomething more feaſible than the other; But the Gentry are <hi>Sui juris,</hi> can no way be reduced but by their own voluntary practice. We are in <hi>England</hi> exceedingly govern'd by Modes and Cuſtoms. The Gentry may effectually Suppreſs Vice, would they but put it out of Faſhion; but to Suppreſs it by Force ſeems impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The Application of this rough Doctrine is in ſhort both to the Gentry and Clergy, <hi>Phyſicians Heal your ſelves;</hi> if you leave off your Drunkenneſs and Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs firſt, if we do not follow you, then ſet us in the Stocks, and ſend us to the Houſe of Correction, and

puniſh us as you pleaſe; if you will leave off Whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt, then Brand us in the Foreheads, or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or Hang us for Fornication or Adultery, and you are welcome; but to preach againſt Drunkenneſs immediately after an Evening's Debauch; to Correct a poor Fellow for Swearing with the very Vice in your Mouths; theſe are the unjuſteſt ways in the World, and have in themſelves no manner of tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Reformation of Manners, which is the true Deſign of the Law.</p>
               <p>'Tis acknowledg'd there are in <hi>England</hi> a great many Sober, Pious, Religious Perſons both among the Gentry and Clergy, and 'tis hoped ſuch cannot think themſelves Libell'd or Injur'd in this <hi>Plea;</hi> if there were not, Laws would never have been made againſt thoſe Vices, for no men make Laws to puniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; 'tis deſign'd to reflect upon none but ſuch as are Guilty, and on them no farther than to put them in mind how much the Nation owes its preſent Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy to their folly, and how much it is in their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> to Reform it again by their Example; that the King may not publiſh <hi>Proclamations,</hi> nor the <hi>Parliament</hi> make Laws to no purpoſe; but that we might live in <hi>England</hi> once more like Chriſtians, and like Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to the Glory of God, and the Honour of the preſent King and Parliament, who ſo publickly have attemped the Great Work of Reformation among us, tho' hitherto to ſo little purpoſe.</p>

               <p>The Treatiſe is individually the ſame which the Author publiſh'd in the Mayoralty of Sir <hi>Humphry Edwin;</hi> the Addreſs by way of Preface, being only left out.</p>

               <head>A DISCOURSE UPON Occaſional Conformity.</head>
               <p>WHEN I review the Paſt Times, and look back upon the various Scenes which they preſent us, as to Eccleſiaſtical Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within this Kingdom, there ſeems nothing more ſtrange than the Turns we have had from Popiſh to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Supremacy, from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion to Reform'd, from Reform'd back again to <hi>Romiſh,</hi> and then to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med again, and ſo on thro' ſeveral Degrees of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and back again from thoſe Degrees to the firſt Steps of Reformation, and then forward again.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, a Prince of a haughty Spirit, diſdaining the Inſolence with which his Predeceſſors were treated by the Popes, gave the firſt Shock to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power in theſe Kingdoms. I won't ſay he acted from any principles of Conſcience, whatever his Ambition and Intereſt led him to pretend; but <hi>that</hi> was the Gloſs, as it is in moſt Caſes of Publick Revolutions. <hi>However it was,</hi> having ſatisfi'd his Pride by ſubduing the Suppremacy of the Pope, and eſtabliſhing his own; his Intereſt next guided him to the Suppreſſion of Abbies and Monaſtries. The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Vices which were protected, as well as practiced in thoſe Neſts of Superſtition, giving his pretence of Piety the larger Scope; and I'll for once be ſo free with the Character of that Prince, as to ſuppoſe what to me ſeems plain, that <hi>neither This Religion, or That, were of</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0454100800:134"/>
                  <hi>much Moment in his Thoughts, but his Intereſt,</hi> as the Sequel made plain, by the Seizure he made of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Church.</p>
               <p>And yet the Juſtice of Providence ſeems very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in that point, That thoſe Houſes, who under the ſpecious pretences of Religion and extraordinary Devotion, had amaſſed to themſelves vaſt Revenues to the Impoveriſhing many Families, and in the mean time ſecretly practiced moſt unheard of Wickedneſs, ſhould under the ſame pretence of Zeal and Piety be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and impoveriſhed by a Perſon, who meerly to ſerve his own Glory, triumph'd over them, pretending, <hi>Jehu</hi> like, <hi>to ſhew his Zeal for the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some do aſſure us, That the Eyes of this Pince were really open'd as to the Point of Religion; and that had he liv'd longer, he would moſt effectually have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd the Reformation in his time; but God who gave him that light, <hi>if he had it,</hi> however he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his Intention, as he did that of <hi>David</hi>'s Building his Houſe, yet he reſerv'd the Glory of the performance to his Son.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, of whom wondrous things are ſpoken in all our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers, and more than we need ſuppoſe ſhould be literally true; yet was without doubt, a Prince of the ſtricteſt Piety, not only that ever reign'd, but that ever liv'd, perhaps, ſince the Days of <hi>Joſidh,</hi> whoſe Parallel our Writers ſay he was.</p>
               <p>The Reformation began in his hand; not but that the Proteſtant Religion had been received in <hi>England</hi> many years before, by the preaching of <hi>John Wickliff, William Tindall,</hi> and others, and had many profeſſors, and thoſe ſuch who gallantly offered their Lives in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Truth.</p>
               <p>But it got but little ground, for Religion has but few Votaries, while all its profeſſors muſt alſo be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and while Exile or Martyrdom is all the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Advantage to be got by it.</p>

None will dare to be Diſſenters in times of Danger, but ſuch whoſe Conſciences are ſo awaken'd that they dare not be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But in the hands of this young Prince, the great work was begun, and in a ſhorter time than could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, was finiſh'd and eſtabliſh'd; the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> fled or conformed; for we find but very few had an Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Martyrdom if it had been put upon them. Some indeed to ſhow the Nature of their Religion, <hi>Pleaded for</hi> Baal, <hi>and Rebell'd,</hi> ſtirring up the Ignorant People to Murther their <hi>Gideon</hi> for throwing down the <hi>Altars of</hi> Baal, but like the <hi>Ephramites</hi> of old, their <hi>Shiboleth</hi> was their undoing.</p>
               <p>God, who thought fit to diſcover the Levity of thoſe who had only Conform'd, and not Reform'd, who, <hi>in exemplum Regis,</hi> had took up this as they would have done any Religion, and alſo for the Tryal and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Church, ſuffer'd all this great Fabrick, <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of his own Working,</hi> to be overthrown at the Death this good King, and a Deluge of Cruelty and Popery overwhelm'd the People in the Reign of the Queen, his Siſter.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Popery</hi> found more Diſſenters than the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had done; and the Impreſſion Religion had made on the minds of thoſe who had ſincerely Embrac'd it, was not ſo eaſily Defac'd as the pretended Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others; For the Gloſſes Men had put on their Actions, only as a cover from common Obſervation, was ſoon Diſcover'd, when the Safety of owning their Old principles render'd thoſe Outſides no longer need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but where the True Religion had got footing in the Mind, it was ſtill the ſame, whatever alterations of Times might meke it Dangerous, <hi>and yet all People did not Burn;</hi> but ſome being perſecuted in one City, fled to another, and <hi>Germany</hi> eſpecially was a Sanctuary for the Diſtreſſed <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, that Country having been before hand with us in the Reformation.</p>

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0454100800:136"/>
'Twas here that our Exil'd Clergy having convers'd with the Learned Reformers abroad, and particularly with <hi>John Calvin,</hi> found, that tho' they were reform'd indeed from the Groſs Errors of Popery and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was yet ſeveral things which might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further Reform'd; and being willing to arrive to the greateſt Perfection they were capable of in Religion, (that as near as poſſible they might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the great Example of Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe Name they profeſs'd, and for whom they cou'd moſt gloriouſly die,) they Corrected in themſelves thoſe things which they ſaw needful, and by Letters to their Brethren in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> communicated their Opinions, with their Reaſons, exhorting them to go on unto perfection as they had begun</p>
               <p>Some of the moſt Zealous for Piety and Holineſs of Life, rejected this Motion; and Others as Zealous and Pious, clos'd with it; and the Diſputes were carried ſo far ſometimes, as to Invade the Charity of one another, an humble Acknowledgment of which you have in a moſt Chriſtian Reconciling Letter from Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> two of the moſt Glorious Triumphant Martyrs that ever confeſt the truth of Chriſt at the Stake.</p>
               <p>For the preſent, the Fire of the Perſecution (as the Greater Light obſcures the Leſs, extinguiſh'd that of Diſſention. But when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reſcu'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the firſt Eſtabliſhment of King <hi>Edward</hi> obtain'd ſo on the Minds of Men, that the further Reformation was rejected. The other Party being not at all convinc'd, tho' over-rul'd, ſubmitted their Perſons to the Laws, but not their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; affirming, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That 'twas the Duty of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to endeavour to ſerve God with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Purity of Worſhip as was poſſible; and that this was the pureſt Worſhip which came neareſt to the Divine Inſtitution, which they believ'd the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Liturgy did not, and therefore in Conſcience they muſt be Diſſenters.</q>

It muſt be own'd, That the Original Authors of theſe Diſputes were Learned, Devout, and ſingularly Pious, ſtrict in Converſation to exceſs, <hi>if that be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> and from thence in a ſort of happy Deriſion, were call'd <hi>Puritans;</hi> of whom I ſhall ſay nothing, but leave for a Record the laſt Speech of a Famous Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, who had ſeen the way of living among thoſe Diſſenters, and ſpeaking of the Words of <hi>Balaam, Let me Die the Death of the Righteous, and let my latter end be like his,</hi> cry'd Out,<q>Sit Anima Mea cum Puritanis <hi>Anglicanis.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not take upon me to obſerve the Difference between theſe Primitive Diſſenters and Our Preſent, which is too plain; nor to diſpute the Subſtance of the Point in Debate between them and the Eſtabliſht National Church.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only obſerve, That the Reaſons for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſſenters Separation from the Eſtabliſht Church, are ſaid to be exactly the ſame they were then; and the preſent Diſſenters are the Succeſſors of thoſe firſt, as the preſent Conformiſts are the Succeſſors of the firſt Reformers under King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt acknowledge that it fares with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and with the Diſſenters both, as it has always far'd with Chriſt's Church in the whole World; That while Suppreſt and Perſecuted, their Profeſſors were few, and their Profeſſion more ſevere; but when a Religion comes to be the Mode of the Country, ſo many painted Hypocrites get into the Church who are not by their Voices to be diſtinguiſh'd, that Guile is not to be ſeen, till it arrive to Apoſtacy. The whole Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, from the firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury of the Chriſtian Church, is full of Inſtances to confirm this, That the Proſperity of the Church of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0454100800:138"/>
Chriſt has been more fatal to it, than all the Peſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Enemies.</p>
               <p>I am now brought down to the preſent Time, when the <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtant</hi> is ſheltered by the Laws and protected from the Violence which he ſuffered in the Late Reigns, under the Arbitrary Commands of ſuch State Miniſters, who ſtrove to daſh the whole Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt to pieces by its own weight; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more apparent to thoſe who are any thing acquainted with the late Management of Affairs in this Land, than that the Court uſed both Parties alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as Policy and Occaſion directed, to Suppreſs and Deſtroy one another; that the whole Houſe, <hi>which being ſo divided, cou'd not ſtand,</hi> might at laſt fall of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But our Eyes are at laſt opened, the Name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant is now the common Title of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> extends her Protection to the tender Conſciences of her Weaker Brethren, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all may be Chriſtians, tho' not alike inform'd, and the Diſſenter extends his Charity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> believing that in his due time, <hi>God ſhall reveal even this unto them.</hi> If this is not, I wiſh this were the Temper of both Parties; and I am ſure it is already the Temper of ſome of each Side, which few are of the Wiſeſt, moſt Pious, and moſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious.</p>
               <p>But while Frailty and Infirmity are Eſſential to Humanity, and Pride and Hypocriſy are the two Regnant Vices of the Church, this good Spirit cannot be Univerſal, and we do not expect it.</p>
               <p>But there is a ſort of Truth, which all Men owe to the Principles they profeſs, and generally ſpeaking, all Men pay it; a <hi>Turk</hi> is a <hi>Turk</hi> zealouſly and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; an <hi>Idolater</hi> is an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and will <hi>ſerve the Devil to a tittle:</hi> None but Proteſtants halt between <hi>God and Baal;</hi> Chriſtians of an Amphibious Nature, who
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0454100800:139"/>
have ſuch prepoſterous Conſciences, as can believe one Way of Worſhip to be right, and yet ſerve God another way themſelves; <hi>This is a ſtrange thing in Iſrael!</hi> All the Hiſtories of Religion in the World do not ſhew ſuch a Caſe: 'Tis like a Ship with her Sails hal'd ſome back and ſome full: 'Tis like a Workman that Builds with one Hand, and pulls down with t'other: 'Tis like a Fiſherman, who catches Fiſh with one Hand, and throws them into the Sea with another: 'Tis like every thing which ſignifies nothing. To ſay a Man can be of two Religions, is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, unleſs there be two Gods to Worſhip, or he has two Souls to ſaue.</p>
               <p>Religion is the ſacred Profeſſion of the Name of God; <hi>ſerving him, believing in him, expecting from him;</hi> and like the God it refers to, 'tis in one and the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, one and the ſame thing perfectly indiviſible and inſeparable there is in it no Neuter Gender, no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Article, <hi>God or Baal;</hi> Mediums are impoſſible.</p>
               <p>As to the different Modes and Ways, which are the Circumſtantials of this Sacred Thing I call Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; I won't ſay, but that as Ships take different Courſes at Sea, yet to the beſt of their Skill, keeping to the direct Rules of Navigating by the Compaſs, they may arrive at the ſame Port; ſo Chriſtians ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king different Methods in the ſerving this God, yet going to the beſt of their Judgments by the direct Rules of the Scripture, may arrive at the ſame Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>but this is nothing at all to the Caſe;</hi> for no Ship would arrive at any Port that ſailed two ways toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>if that were poſſible;</hi> nor no man can ſerve One God, and at the ſame time hold two Opinions. There is but one Beſt, and he that gives God <hi>two Beſts,</hi> gives him the Beſt and the Worſt, and one Spoils t'other, till both are good for nothing.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid already, that both the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Diſſenter, ſuffer in their Reputation
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0454100800:140"/>
for the mixt Multitudes of their Members, which is occaſion'd by their preſent Proſperity: If a Third Party were to tyrannize over them both, we ſhould ſee then who were <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and who were <hi>Confeſſors;</hi> but now it cannot be: Wherefore, I think 'twere well to put both Sides in mind of one thing, which they are bound mutually to obſerve; and that is, That <hi>the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Miſcarriages of any particular Perſon or Member, is not really any Reflection upon the Religion they profeſs,</hi> nor ought not to be ſo accounted, unleſs it be where ſuch Miſcarriages are the direct Dictates of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines they teach; and thus I would be underſtood in the preſent Caſe. Wherefore I ſhall give my Eſſay as to what I underſtand a Real Diſſenting <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is, or ought to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He who Diſſents from an Eſtabliſh'd Church on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but from a real Principle of Conſcience, is a Politick, not a Religious Diſſenter.</hi> To explain my ſelf; He who Diſſents from any other Reaſons, but ſuch as theſe, That he firmly believes the ſaid Eſtabliſhed Church is not of the pureſt Inſtitution, but that he can real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve God more agreeable to his Will, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly 'tis his Duty to do it ſo, <hi>and no otherwiſe.</hi> Nay, he that cannot Dye, or at leaſt deſire to do ſo, rather than Conform, <hi>ought to Conform. Schiſm</hi> from the Church of Chriſt is, doubtleſs, a great Sin, and if I can avoid it, I ought to avoid it, but if not, the Cauſe of that Sin carries the Guilt with it.</p>
               <p>But if I ſhall thus Diſſent, and yet at the ſame time Conform; by Conforming I deny my Diſſent being lawful, or by my Diſſenting I damn my Conforming as ſinful.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be lawful and unlawful at the ſame time; if it be not lawful for me to Diſſent, I ought to Conform; but if it be unlawful for me to Conform, I muſt Diſſent; ſeveral Opinions may at the ſame
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0454100800:141"/>
time conſiſt in a Country, in a City, in a Family, but not in one entire Perſon, <hi>that is impoſſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To come to the point; there are Diſſenters who are ſeparated from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and join'd in Communion with Diſſenting Churches or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. They have appear'd Zealous, Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Conſtant; have born the Reproaches and Inconveniences of their Party, nay, ſuffer'd Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Loſs of Eſtates and Liberty for the Cauſe: And who could have ſo little Charity as to doubt the Sincerity of their Profeſſion? And yet theſe Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Suffering Diſſenters, to make themſelves room in the Publick Advancements, and Glittering Gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Honours of the Age, ſhall Conform to that which they refus'd under all thoſe Diſadvantages to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And which is worſe than all this; hear O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! as ſoon as the preſent Honour is attain'd, the preſent Advantage made, they return to the former Circumſtances again, and are freely receiv'd, <hi>a double Crime,</hi> as having done no Evil.</p>
               <p>I know not, I profeſs, what theſe Perſons can ſay for themſelves, and therefore cannot pretend to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Objections; but I cannot omit one Anſwer which ſome People give for them, <hi>viz. That this is no Conformity in Point of Religion, but done as a Civil Action,</hi> in Obedience to the Laws of the Land, which have made it a neceſſary Characteriſtick Quality, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into publick Employments, which they think it their Duty to accept in order to ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which they doubly perform by Executing thoſe Offices to the publick Intereſt, and by excluding thoſe who would otherwiſe get into thoſe places, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Country and their Liberties.</p>
               <p>I have never met with any conſiderable Excuſe made for this faſt and looſe Game of Religion, but this, and this I deſire to conſider a little particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That this is no Conformity in Point of Religion, but done</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0454100800:142"/>
                  <hi>as a Civil Action.</hi> How this can be poſſible remains to be determined. 'Tis true, the Morality of an Action conſiſts in its End; but I cannot conceive that an Action purely and originally Religious, ſuch as the Solemn Ordinances of God's Worſhip, can be made Civil Actions by any End, Deſign, Will, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Man whatſoever. 'Tis true, an Oath, which is a calling God to witneſs, is an Action both Civil and Religious, but ſtill that was appointed and inſtituted to that end, as is expreſly noted, <hi>Heb. Naaman</hi>'s bowing in the Houſe of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> to which the Prophet anſwered, <hi>Go in Peace,</hi> which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a permiſſion, is a thing ſtill different; for <hi>Naaman</hi> only bowed for the Conveniency or State of the King, at the ſame time publickly diſowning the Worſhip, as <hi>Interpreters are of Opinion;</hi> beſides, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Head, tho' it may be a cuſtomary Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at that place, yet is no Act confin'd to Worſhip only, and inſtituted and directed ſo by the God who is Worſhipped, but is an Act us'd in Common Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Thus we kneel to God, and to the King; but Sacraments are things appropriated by the Divine Inſtitution of God himſelf, as things which have no other Signification or Import but what is Divine: Had <hi>Naaman</hi> deſir'd to be excuſed in offering Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to the Idol <hi>Rimmon,</hi> the Prophet would hardly have bid him go in peace. Some Actions are not Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Religious, as they are Civilly or Religiouſly perform'd, but as they are Civil or Religious in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſome Religious Actions are ſo entirely ſuch, that they cannot without a horrid invaſion of the Soveraignty of the Inſtitutor be appropriated to any other uſe; and ſuch are in eſpecial manner, the Two Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt, ſuch was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, the Sacrifices by Fire; And the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God on <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Ahihu,</hi> for attempting to offer Sacrifice with ſtrange Fire, ſtands as a terrible
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0454100800:143"/>
Inſtance of what we ought to think is the Will of God in this matter.</p>
               <p>Further, ſpeaking directly of the Sacraments, Are they not the ſame thing, tho' differently Adminiſtred in the eſtabliſh'd Church, or in a diſſenting Church? and how can you take it as a Civil Act in one place, and a Religious Act in another? This is <hi>playing-Bopeep</hi> with God Almighty, and no Man can tell of them when they are about a Civil Action, and when about a Religious. But to anſwer this pretence at once, Sacraments as Sacraments are Religious Acts, and can be no other, if you do not take it as a Sacrament the Caſe differs, but how can you ſay you do not take it as a Sacrament? An Oath is to be taken in the Senſe of the Impoſer, and a Sacrament, which is a Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt Sacred of Oaths, muſt be alſo taken in the Senſe of the Impoſer. If the Perſon Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring declar'd at the Adminiſtration, <hi>He did not give it as a Sacrament, but only give you a bit of Bread and Draught of Wine as a Friend,</hi> or the like, this was ſomething; but can a Miniſter deliver the Bread to you, and ſay, <hi>The Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. and you Kneeling with Reverence take it as ſuch, and repeat the Reſponſes at the Communion, and ſay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to the Prayer, and ſay 'tis a Civil Action. This is ſuch Bantering with Religion, as no Modeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can think of without Horror.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another part of the Apology is, That without it they cannot be admitted into Publick places of Truſt; and if they were not admitted, ſuch will get in as will betray their Country and Liberties, and they do it purely to ſecure their Country, which they think their Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are Patriots indeed, that</hi> will <hi>damn their Souls to ſave their Countrey;</hi> a ſort of a Publick Spirit hardly to be found in the World, and indeed a Non-entity in it ſelf, for 'tis a Miſtake; the Gentlemen who make
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0454100800:144"/>
this Anſwer, put the caſe wrong. For I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch to Anſwer a few Queſtions. ear</p>
               <p>If the Service of their Country be ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e to them, pray why ſhould they not chuſe to expo their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Eſtates for that Service, rather than their Souls?</p>
               <p>The Penalty of the Law in accepting the Publick Employments is wholly Pecuniary; the difference lies here, <hi>they chuſe the Treſpaſſing on their Conſciences, before the hazard of their Eſtates,</hi> as the leaſt Evil; for 'tis plain, any Man who will ſuffer the Penalty, or run the Riſque of it, which is all one, may excuſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; for the Lord does not ſay, you ſhall ſo and ſo Conform, but if you do not Conform, you ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ſuch and ſuch Penalties; any Man that will incur the Penalty, may commit the Treſpaſs.</p>
               <p>So that all this Compliance is not, To be admitted to Places, that they may be able to ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but to ſave the Five hundred pounds and other Penalties of that Act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why, if we believe the Power of God to be Omnipotent, ſhould we imagine that he is not able to protect our Country and Liberties, without our perpetrating ſo wicked an Act to ſecure them, <hi>as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil that Good may come,</hi> which is expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>But we are told again, This is in it ſelf no Sinful Act, and therefore it is not doing Evil. This is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly anſwered before; tho' 'tis not a Sinful Act in it ſelf, <hi>Yet 'tis either a Sinful Act in a Diſſenter, or elſe his Diſſenting before was a Sinful Act.</hi> For if he is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied he does well in Conforming now, why did he not before? There is but one Anſwer for that, which is, He is otherwiſe convinced; to which I reply, If that were true, he would then as a Convert continue in this New Communion; but 'tis evident the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons return immediately to the former Profeſſion as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0454100800:145"/>
Diſſenters, and they can have no ſuch Excuſe unleſs it be, that they were convinc'd and reconvinc'd, and then convinc'd again.</p>
               <p>Some have the Folly to argue againſt the Law it ſelf, as a moſt Notorious Impoſition upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Man, by making the Sacred Inſtitutions of Chriſt a Drudge to Secular <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and a Cauſe of mens Sins, by leading them into Tempation; I could ſay enough to vindicate that part, tho I am no more reconcil'd to that Law, than other Men, but 'tis remote to our Argumnet: 'Tis an Act of Parliament, and what is ſo, is of every Man's own doing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis juſt every one ſhou'd comply with the Terms, or ſuffer the Penalty; but here is no <hi>Penalty,</hi> if no Crime; <hi>if no Preferments are ſought, no Honours accepted, there is no Crime;</hi> if Self denial was as practicable as Self advancement, here is no need of the <hi>Crime.</hi> So that they who do this, <hi>ſeek the Crime, that is the firſt Sin; then Morgage their Conſciences to avoid the Penalty,</hi> and ſo add one Sin to another. But we are told by ſome, 'tis not againſt their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> they hope both <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are Good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> there are differences between them which they don't underſtand nor meddle with, and their Conſciences are very well ſatisfied to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with either.</p>
               <p>I would ask ſuch, if their Conſciences would ſerve to Communicate with the Church, why did they Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? For Communicating with the <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> is not an Occaſional or Caſual thing, but an open declar'd breaking off from the <hi>Church</hi> Eſtabliſht. Now no Man can be ſaid to ſeparate from, and joyn to a thing at the ſame time; if your <hi>Conſcience</hi> is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Joyning, it cannot be ſatisfied in Separating, unleſs you can ſuppoſe your Conſcience to be ſatisfied and diſſatisfied both together. If you have a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any Religion at all, it muſt be of ſome Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or other; if of this, it cannot be of that, if of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0454100800:146"/>
ſent and Approve, are different Acts, and can never be fixt upon the ſame Object at the ſame time; as for a Man, Paſſively Religious, that can Communicate any where, that Man may from the ſame Principle, and with far leſs Guilt Communicate no where, for ſuch a Man, in down-right <hi>Engliſh,</hi> has Proſtituted the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Religion he had, <hi>if ever he had any,</hi> to his Intereſt, and may be <hi>Turk, Jew, Papiſt,</hi> or any thing.</p>
               <p>The latter part of the Charge leads me to conſider another Point, which relates to the Aſſemblies of the Diſſenters, who admit, and by conſequence approve this way of proceeding. I do not pretend to examine by what Methods ſuch particular Churches do procced. And I would be as tender as poſſible in making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. I wiſh they would be as Charitable in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring this Reproof.</p>
               <p>I do think, with Submiſſion, 'tis impoſſible to prove that any Perſon, whoſe Caſe the foregoing Paragraph reaches, can be receiv'd again into Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Diſſenting Aſſembly upon any other Terms, <hi>than as a Penitent.</hi> I have heard of ſome, who have been ſaid to have leave from their Miniſters for this Matter; <hi>if ſo,</hi> they have aſſum'd ſome <hi>Diſpenſing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> which I believe does not appertain to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Function, nor is not contain'd in the Miſſion of our Saviour. But I do not affirm, That any ſuch thing has been really allow'd.</p>
               <p>As to the Relation of Churches, and the Members thereof, one to another, as the Diſſenters now Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd them; I am ſure, the allowance of any Member in a Promiſcuous Communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Diſſenter at the ſame time, is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be allow'd, nor is it conſiſtent with it ſelf. 'Tis Prepoſterous, and Excentrick, and is Deſtructive of the very Foundation of the Diſſenters Principles, as is already noted, concerning Schiſms in the Church. In this Caſe, Charity can heal nothing, nor help no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0454100800:147"/>
'tis of abſolute neceſſity that one Man be but of one ſide, at one and the ſame time. Either the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt will mar the Diſſenter, or the Diſſenter will mar the Conformiſt. For if I ſhall be admitted into the Communion of the Diſſenter, and of the Church together; then the Diſſenter muſt have ſome other Reaſon for being a Diſſenter, than Purity of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Methinks Men ſhould ſeem what they are; if a Man Diſſent from the Church, let him do ſo; and his Principle being well grounded for ſuch Diſſent, let him hold it; if not well-grounded, let him leave it; if he cannot ſuffer one way, let him ſuffer another; and why ſhould we not be as honeſt to God as our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>The Motives to ſerve our Country are ſtrong, but there are ways to do it without ſuch a Violation of all our Principles and Profeſſion; if not, truſt God's Providence with the Iſſue, who never wants Agents to preſerve and deliver his People when his time is at hand; and you can have ſmall hope to expect that the Office and Truſt you ſhall Execute, ſhall receive any Aſſiſtance from his Providence, when the firſt Step into it, is made by offering the greateſt Affront to his Honour, and committing the vileſt Act of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy in the World.</p>
               <p>But if the gay Proſpect of a great Place, tempt any Perſon beyond the Power that God's Grace is pleas'd to aſſiſt them with, <hi>in that way let him abide,</hi> and not be re-admitted, becauſe of his Gold Ring, and Fine Apparel, without a Penitent Acknowledgement. The Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> can never pretend to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters upon the mere Principle of Purity of Worſhip, as I have related in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, if ſuch ſhall be receiv'd as blameleſs into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who have deſerted them upon the occaſion of Preferment, and have made the Sacred Inſtitutions of Chriſt Jeſus, become Pimps to their Secular Intereſt,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0454100800:148"/>
and then wipe their Mouths, and ſit down in the Church, and ſay, <hi>They have done no Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis alſo an Intolerable Affront to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> reflecting upon its Doctrine as well as Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; to make uſe of the Church for a <hi>Cover</hi> to fence them againſt the Laws, at the ſame time continuing to diſown its Communion, as a thing not fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in.</p>
               <p>And yet the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in the right to receive ſuch of the Diſſenters as ſhall come to them without the Ceremony of Recognition, becauſe it is agreeable to the Notion of a National Church, which they profeſs to be. But Diſſenters are bound to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Separation from them, or elſe their whole Conſtitution falls to the Ground. Now, how a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and a Conformity are Conſiſtent, is to me an Inexplicable Riddle.</p>
               <p>I queſtion not here the Lawfulneſs of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Separation; it is not the buſineſs of this Diſcourſe to define it; and I am as careful as I can in making Reflections upon either; but I am bold to affirm, That no Diſſenting Church can with lawful Cauſe Separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Eſtabliſh Private Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Communions, and at the ſame times allow the Members to Conform to the Eſtabliſh'd Church too: This is incongruous, and one muſt deſtroy the other. From whence I think it becomes the Diſſenters, if they would maintain the Doctrine they teach; if they would have us believe they Diſſent purely on the honeſt Principles of Conſcience, and Purity of Worſhip, with ſuch a one, <hi>No, not to Eat.</hi> And it is not ſufficient that the Offender a Lord Mayor, or any greater Perſon; unleſs he would be Lord Mayor without a Breach of the Sacred Relation he had entred into, he ſhould be dealt with in that Caſe, as the meaneſt Member of ſuch a Society.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if a Man be call'd upon to be a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0454100800:149"/>
Magiſtrate, and has Courage enough to follow the Impartial Dictates of his Conſcience, a Query lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, What ſhall he do?</p>
               <p>The Caſe is plain; <hi>Either refuſe the Honour, or run the Riſque.</hi> The firſt indeed is the plaineſt and eaſieſt Way, and the Ground of it is good, for he whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience Dictates to him that the Terms are Sinful, may refuſe the Call; for Preferments and Honours are a Bait that ſome have refuſed on meer Points of Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Philoſophy; and 'tis hard, Chriſtianity ſhou'd not carry a Man as far. Well, but <hi>perhaps a Man has a mind to be a Sheriff or a Lord Mayor,</hi> and is a Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or perhaps he really thinks 'tis his Indiſpenſable Duty to ſerve his Country, if he is call'd to that, or the like Office; or perhaps he thinks 'tis a Duty he owes his Family, to advance his Children, and the like, and he is a Profeſt Diſſenter: What ſhall he do? Let him boldly run the Riſque, or openly and honeſtly Conform to the Church, and neither be aſham'd of his Honour, nor of his Profeſſion; ſuch a Man all Men will Value, and God will own: He need not fear car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying the Sword to a Conventicle, or bringing the Conventicle to his own Houſe. But to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Game, to dodge Religions, and go in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church, and in the Afternoon to the Meeting; to Communicate in private with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to ſave a Penalty, and then go back to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters and Communicate again there: This is ſuch a Retrograde Devotion, that I can ſee no colour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for in all the Sacred Book.</p>
               <p>I have heard, indeed, that ſome, who are Miniſters of Diſſenting Churches do, or did at the ſame time Communicate with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I do not diſpute how far a Miniſter may Conform as a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, tho' he cannot as a Clergy-man; but how any Diſſenting Miniſter can Conform as a Lay-man, and at the ſame time execute a Paſtoral Charge over a

'Tis hard for a Man to ſay, all the World is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but himſelf; but if it be ſo who can help it?</p>
            <p>But ſince 'tis not likely a Single Vote ſhou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon Eſpous'd Errors, in an Age when every one is ſo fond of themſelves, he that ſtarts Truth by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt expect the World will ſtand ſtill and look on till they ſee the Iſſue.</p>
            <p>The Act depending in the Houſe of Commons about Occaſional Conformity has ſet abundance of Heads to Work in the World; and be the Houſe in the Right, or in the Wrong, I know my own Buſineſs, and their Temper too well to meddle with it: But I pretend to ſay, that all Men I have met with, who have med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with the Argument, either in Print or otherwiſe, are manifeſtly Miſtaken.</p>
            <p>With more Humility therefore than I owe to any Man, I ask leave not to be Cenſur'd till I am Heard; and thoſe who call me Arrogant before, reprove me with more Arrogance than is their ſhare among their Fellow Creatures.</p>
            <p>But ſince I, <hi>who was altogether Born in Sin,</hi> have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to teach my Superiors, I deſire to explain my ſelf before they caſt me out of the Synagogue.</p>
            <p>For as that Blind Man thought 'twas a Marvellous thing they ſhould not know whence he came that had opened his Eyes.</p>
            <p>So to me 'tis every jot as wonderful to find no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of my Mind, and yet be Poſitively aſſured that I am in the Right.</p>
            <p>The Subject I am upon needs no Introduction, the Hiſtory is in every Mans Knowledge; the Parliament are upon a Bill to prevent Occaſional Conformity, and about that Bill the Preſs ſwarms with Pamphlets; the Pulpit ſounds with Exaltations on one Hand, and Deprecations on the other; every one ſpeak their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, ſome their Hopes, ſome their Fears, and ſo it ſhou'd have been to the end of the Chapter, if I cou'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0454100800:152"/>
have found but one middle Sort, that, free from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Parties, cou'd have diſcern'd the Native State of the Caſe as it really is, diſcover'd from the Paſſions and Follies of Men.</p>
            <p>About their Act of Parliament I affirm moſt of the People I have met with are Miſtaken; and that I may be as Explicit as I can, I ſhall enquire more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who are miſtaken, how, and then I doubt not the Sequel of this Paper ſhall make it appear that the Fact is true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> All thoſe People who deſign'd the Act as a Blow to the Diſſenting Intereſt in <hi>England;</hi> are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>

            <p>

               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> All thoſe Diſſenters who Deprecate it as a Judgment, or wou'd Vote againſt it, if it were in their Power, are Miſtaken.</p>

               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That all thoſe who begun or promoted this Bill with a Deſign to Ruin, Weaken and Deſtroy the Intereſt or Body of the Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> are Miſtaken.</p>

Not that I hereby ſuppoſe the Parliament or the Perſons Originally concern'd in moving this Bill, did it in meer Kindneſs to the Diſſenters, in order to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and Purge them from the Scandals, which ſome People had brought upon them, that 'twas an Action of Chriſtian Charity to the Diſſenters, to Prevent and Detect Frauds and Hypocriſie in Religion, and to clear their Reputation.</p>
            <p>I never yet ſaw or read of a Diviſion of Parties in any Nation, but the Hot Heads of both Parties were always for Enflaming the Reckoning; if the Hot Men of the Diſſenters have done any Miſchief, I am ſorry for it; but let us Examine a little what other Hot Men wou'd be now a doing.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was Queen <hi>Ann</hi> ſettl'd upon the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> and had declar'd that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhou'd be the Men of Her Favour, as being the Church She had been Educated in, and ever conſtant to, but theſe Hot Men fly out upon their Brethren with all the Exceſſes of their furious Temper.</p>
            <p>Nothing wou'd ſerve them, but this Queen and Parliament muſt, Root and Branch, blaſt the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their Breath, blow up their Intereſt in the Nation, and we ſhou'd be all one Church and one Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of a ſudden; 'twas to be done with a Blow all at once, and ſo certainly, that no poſſible Doubt could be made of it.</p>
            <p>But Her Majeſty was pleas'd to let theſe People know from Her own Mouth, that for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Her, they were Miſtaken; in that, upon the Addreſs of the Diſſenters to Her, She gave them Her Royal Word for Her Protection, and whenever She breaks it, we ſhall all be Miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Pulpit, that Drum Eccleſiaſtick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the War, and Mr. <hi>Sachavrell,</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Oxford,</hi> Dooms all the Diſſenters to Deſtruction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Bell, Book, or Candle; not regarding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0454100800:154"/>
Decency, not reſpecting his good Manners to the Queen, nor his Deference to the Parliament; but tells them 'tis their Duty, if they will be true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to lift up a Standard againſt the Phanaticks, and the like; as much as to ſay, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, whatever your Majeſty has promis'd, You muſt break Your Word;</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, we will have you do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all theſe Gentlemen have liv'd to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Miſtaken; and if they retain any Expectations of ſeeing it fulfill'd, they muſt exerciſe their Faith upon it, as a thing <hi>in Futuro,</hi> and believe that ſome time or other Her Majeſty will break her Word; but as yet there is no great Probability, for hitherto we have ſeen we are all miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But to revive their Expectations, comes a Bill into the Houſe for preventing Occaſional Conformity, this has been matter of great Triumph to ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who upon this Act revive their common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and are pleas'd to treat the Diſſenters in this manner: <hi>Well, Gentlemen, now down you go, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are a beginning with you, and they don't uſe to do Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs by halves, they have taken the Inſulted Church into Conſideration, they will reduce you, and this is the firſt Step, you ſhall ſoon ſee ſome more on't: We have got a Church Parliament now, and down ye go, this Bill will effectually Ruin your Intereſt, and bring all your Great Men off from you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings us cloſe to the Point; and 'tis no ſmall matter for any one to ſhow theſe Gentlemen how they are miſtaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis time for theſe Gentlemen to tell us what the Parliament will do when they either know it, or the Houſe has declar'd their Intentions; and till they have, 'tis a Preſumption ſome Houſes would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice of, for any People to pretend to lead them to their Buſineſs; and therefore when they tell us this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0454100800:155"/>
is a Taſte of the reſt they are preparing for us, I muſt ſay, either they are too well acquainted with the Mind of the Houſe, or they are all Miſtaken; and as to the Blow this Bill is to the Diſſenters Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As far as I may be allow'd to give my Judgement, and as the Nature of the Thing ſeems to ſpeak its ſelf; 'tis plain this Bill is no Damage at all to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters in <hi>England,</hi> and we hope the Houſe did not intend it as ſuch.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine that ſo great a Spirit of Enmity and contempt can be entertain'd in the Breaſt of a Nation againſt their Neighbours, their Brethren, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Born in the ſame Climate, ſubmitting to the ſame Government, profeſſing the ſame God, and in moſt Fundamental Points of Religion agreeing, People link'd together in the ſame common Intereſt, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarriages continually mixt in Relation, concern'd in the ſame Trade, making War with the ſame Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Allied with the ſame Friends; were it not that theſe People, call'd Diſſenters, are repreſented to them under ſome ſtrange and untrue Character, or that under the Name of Diſſenter, ſome ill Perſons are ſhrowded and diſguis'd, who deſerve to be thus Treated.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in order to ſet the Diſſenters Right in the Eyes of their Brethren, and that they may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice at leaſt, if they can have nothing of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, that Peace may be where there is no Occaſion for War, and Quietneſs, and good Manners preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 'twill be needful to ſet the Matter in a true Light, and examine who this Diſſenter is, what the People Diſſenters are, and what they have done, for which they are Treated after ſo infamous a Manner by Scurrilous Preachers, and Scandalous Pamphleteers, and other ignorant People, not a few.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenter is an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> that being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0454100800:156"/>
deſirous of going to Heaven, having heard his Church of <hi>England</hi> Father, and School-maſter, and the Miniſter of the Pariſh, talk much of it, begins ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to enquire about the Way thither, and to that Purpoſe conſulting his Bible and his Conſcience, he finds that in his Opinion there are ſome Things in the Eſtabliſh'd Way of Worſhip, which do not ſeem to correſpond with the Rule he has found out in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall not examine here whether the Man thus ſcrupulous be in the Right, or whether the Church be in the Right, it does not at all belong to the Caſe in Hand.</p>
            <p>But the Man being fully convinc'd that he ought to Worſhip God in that Way, excluſive of all others, which is moſt agreeable to the Will of God reveal'd in the Scripture; and being on mature Conſideration alſo, and after ſincere Endeavours to be otherwiſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, fully convinc'd that this Eſtabliſh'd Way is not ſo near to that Rule as it ought to be, ventures the Diſpleaſure of the Civil Magiſtrate in Diſſenting, in pure Obedience to the Commands of his Conſcience, and of that Rule which bids him obey God rather than Man; firmly believing that 'tis his Duty ſo to do; and that the Compaſs and Extent of Humane Laws do not reach to bind him in Matters of Conſcience; at the ſame time living in Charity with all the reſt of the World whoſe Conſciences do not require the ſame Reſtriction, and Peaceably ſubmitting to the Laws and Government he lives under, as far as either his Right, as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> or his Duty as a Chriſtian, can require.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenter which I have been ſpeaking of, and concerning whom I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to ſay, ſo many Men, <hi>ſo much Wiſer than I,</hi> are Miſtaken.</p>
            <p>If there are crept into his Company State Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0454100800:157"/>
Politick Diſſenters, or any that give no Reaſon or other, or leſs Reaſons, for their Diſſenting than theſe, they are not of them, and we wiſh they would go out from them.</p>
            <p>I ſee no Act of Parliament a making to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of this Diſſenter; and let Hot Men, Preach, Print, and Say, what they pleaſe, it is impoſſible it ſhou'd ever enter into the Breaſt of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Queen, either to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or Suppreſs ſuch a Diſſenter.</p>
            <p>'Tis for the Protection of this Honeſt, Well-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Diſſenter, that in the late Reign the King and Parliament finding their Number Great, thought it was Meet for the Quiet of the Nation, and as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Superiority of Conſcience to all Humane Laws, to Settle their Liberty in an Act of Parliament; the ſame undiſputed Authority on which all our Civil, as well as Religious, Rights are Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
            <p>This is the Diſſenter to which Her Majeſty has promiſed Her Protection, and this Act of Parliament is the Toleration to Tender Conſciences, for which Her Majeſty openly declar'd Her Self, even to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Her Royal Perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Diſſenters who never gave Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty any Reaſon to believe they did not Merit Her Protection, and I firmly believe never will.</p>
            <p>From theſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> has nothing to fear, unleſs their Exemplary Lives, and Unqueſtion'd Piety, ſhou'd prevail to weaken Her Numbers, and we heartily wiſh all the Strife were reduc'd to this, <hi>viz.</hi> who ſhou'd Live beſt, and who ſhou'd Preach beſt.</p>
            <p>If there are among them Vicious Youths, or Grown Hypocrites; if there are crept in Errors, Hereſies and Enthuſiaſts; are not the ſame among the Church? If there are among theſe Diſſenters, <hi>Quakers, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Sweet-Singers, Muggletonians,</hi> and the like; the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0454100800:158"/>
Church has alſo Her <hi>Socinians, Deiſts, Anti-Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Scepticks, Aſgilites,</hi> and the like; there can be no Advantage pleaded againſt Hereſie, and Damnable Heterodox Opinions, from one ſide more than another.</p>
            <p>If we regard the Matters of State, the Diſſenters, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have ſmall Advantage of the Argument one againſt another; and I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arrogance Challenge the Hot Church-Men, who can Treat them with nothing but the Odious Name of Diſturbers of the Peace, Enemies of Monarchy, and Authors of Confuſion, to bring the Loyalty of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſo much boaſted of in the World, to the Teſt, with the Loyalty of the Diſſenter; <note place="margin">New Teſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Loyalty. <hi>P.</hi>
               </note> and as it has lately been done to my Hand, it is eaſie to prove that the Diſſenter has been equally Loyal to Princes, equally True to the Government and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church; and the Church has been equally Diſloyal, and has as often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and took Arms againſt the Lawful Eſtabliſh'd Power and Prince, as the Diſſenter; and let them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this Diſpute whenever they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But what is all this to the preſent Caſe? What we do as <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> is one thing, and what we do as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and Diſſenters, is another.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo Foreign to our Purpoſe to Examine or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Dr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> or the Multitude of Pamphleteers, who place themſelves at the forelorn Hope of the Church, and begin the War in hopes of drawing on that whole Body to an Engagement; when they can make it out, that the Diſſenter and the Church are as far aſunder in Religion as God and <hi>Baal,</hi> I may poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think they Merit what they ſo much Covet, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Reply'd to.</p>

            <p>We would be glad we had no Cauſe to think our ſelves Injur'd; and to ſuch of the Church of <hi>England</hi> who can judge without Prejudice, we would Appeal whether it is not very Hard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Diſſenter ſhall be excluded from all
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0454100800:161"/>
Places of Profit, Truſt and Honour, and at the ſame time ſhall not be excuſed from thoſe which are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Charge, Trouble, and Loſs of his Time?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a Diſſenter ſhall be Preſs'd as a Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to Fight at Sea, Liſted as a Soldier to Fight on Shore, and let his Merit be never ſo much above his Fellows, ſhall never be capable of Preferment; no, not a Lieutenant at Sea, or ſo much as a Halbert in the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we muſt maintain our own Clergy, and your Clergy; our own Poor, and your Poor; pay equal Taxes, and equal Duties; and not be thought worthy to be Truſted to ſet a Drunkard in the Stocks.</p>
            <p>We wonder, Gentlemen, you will accept our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on your Deficient Funds, our Stocks to help car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on your Wars, our Loans and Credits to your Victualling Office, and Navy Office.</p>
            <p>If you would go on to diſtinguiſh us, get a Law made we ſhall Buy no Lands, that we may not be Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; and ſee if you could find Money to Buy us out.</p>
            <p>Tranſplant us into Towns and Bodies, and let us Trade by our ſelves; let us Card, Spin, Knit, and Work, with and for one another, and ſee how you will maintain your own Poor without us.</p>
            <p>Let us Fraight our Ships apart, keep our Money out of your Bank, accept none of our Bills, and ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your ſelves as abſolutely from us in Civil Matters, as we do from you in Religious, and ſee how you can go on without us.</p>
            <p>If you are not willing to do this, but we muſt live among you, Trade, Work, Receive and Pay, together, why may we not do it in Peace, with Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without daily Reproach? If we have any Knaves among us, take them, if we have any Hypocrites, any who can Conform, and do not, we are free to part with them, that the Remainder may be all ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:0454100800:162"/>
agree with the Character here given; and when you have Garbl'd us to your Hearts deſire, and ours, you need never fear your Church, as to her Politick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the World; Pray then let us be quiet.</p>
            <p>What have we to do with your Diſtinctions of Whig and Tory? No farther that I know of than this, that when, diſtinct from our Religious Concerns, we come to talk of our Liberties, Properties, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, we are not for having them deſtroy'd by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Authority, Diſpenſing Power, and the like; and if this be to be Whigs, ye are Whigs.</p>
            <p>As to Kings and Rulers, we are of the Opinion, that when they Degenerate into Tyrants, Oppreſs their People, Deſtroy the Laws, with all the <hi>et caetera</hi>'s of Arbitrary Power, 'tis Lawful for the Injur'd People to Reduce them to Reaſon, and to ſeek Protection, and Powerful Help, from any Body, to Aſſiſt them to Recover their Undoubted Rights and Liberties; if this be to be Traitors, why then, Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hold up your Hands; how ſay you? Are you Guilty, or not Guilty?</p>
            <p>As to Oaths, <hi>with which, Gentlemen, ye were the Men that loaded your Allegiance farther than you had any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> we are of the Opinion, that they can bind the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject no longer than the Soveraign continues the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Executive Power; and that the late King by his Deſerting the Throne, Abſolv'd all his Subjects from the Bond of their Allegiance; and on this Foot we made no Scruple to Swear to the Government, as it now ſtands on the Foot of the late Revolution; and if you have Sworn with us, and yet do not believe ſo, you may get off of the Perjury if you can.</p>
            <p>And what need is there now of running down the Diſſenters with a full Cry, as if this Act a coming out was a Machine to blow them all up; we ſee no Harm in it at all, other than the Hardſhips we mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt of which we ſuffer'd before, and are like
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0454100800:163"/>
only to have them the faſter entail'd on our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>All thoſe Gentlemen therefore who think this Act will weaken the Diſſenters, or wiſh it would, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly Miſtaken; it may diſtinguiſh them better, and I am perſwaded will fortifie them in their Honeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; 'twill teach them, that if they will hold faſt the Truth, they muſt learn to live like People under the Power of thoſe who hate them, and deſpitefully uſe them.</p>
            <p>The Diſſenters too are ſtrangely Miſtaken in their Apprehenſions of the Ill Conſequences of this Act.</p>
            <p>To ſuch I wou'd ſay, I cannot imagine what they have to fear from it, or why they ſhou'd be uneaſie with the Honour they are alſo rid of, the Encumbrance of being Mayors, Aldermen, Jurats, and Sheriffs of the Towns and Corporations; and let them but reflect what was the Gain that all the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have made by Places and Penſions from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſince the late Revolution, I am perſwaded 'twill not all amount to the Sum that one Churchman will be found to have Cheated the Nation of.</p>
            <p>The Church are willing to engroſs all the Knaves to themſelves, and let them do it, and welcome, tho' they get all the Money into the Bargain; if they would but come to a fair Account with us now, and repay all the Diſſenters Money the Nation has been Cheated of by Church Knaves, I dare undertake the Diſſenters ſhall repay all that can be charg'd on their Knaves out of the Ballance.</p>
            <p>The Foundation of the Diſſenters Safety is lodg'd, by God's Eſpecial Providence, in the Queen's Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; while Her Majeſty eſteems Her Word Sacred, as She has aſſur'd us She will, we have no Occaſion to be concern'd at all.</p>
            <p>The Safety of the Diſſenters conſiſt in their own Honeſty and Integrity; while they do nothing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0454100800:164"/>
either Her Majeſty, or the Laws, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have a Parliament of Church Bigots, or of Pulpit <hi>Sachaverells,</hi> there will be no Fear of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>As to the preſent Act, I doubt not but they will live to ſee Cauſe to be thankful for the making it, when the Miſcarriages of all People in Publick Offices and Employments are ſo eminently fix'd upon a Party, and ſo openly and fairly taken off from them.</p>
            <p>They are Miſtaken too in the Sence of the Preſent Parliament; and they may be aſſur'd, had not their Enemies ſeen that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant Parliament, as this is, is not to be prevail'd upon to Overthrow ſo Subſtantial a Part of the Nations Liberty as is ſetled in the Act of Toleration, they had not reſted ſo long, but before now had attempted it.</p>
            <p>They have try'd it in the Pulpit, ſcatter'd it in Scandalous Pamphlets from the Preſs, affirmed that Toleration is Deſtructive of the Churches, as well as the Nations Safety; they have endeavour'd, by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny and Reproach to blacken the Diſſenters with Crimes never committed; and which they wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver own before, are at laſt come to repreſent them as a formidable Party.</p>
            <p>And yet all this cou'd never bring ſo much as One Member of the Houſe to be ſo blind to his Countries Intereſt, as to make a Motion againſt the Act of Toleration.</p>
            <p>Being thus diſappointed, and willing to play at ſmall Game rather than ſtand out, they fly to the Sanctuary of this Bill, and feign themſelves gratify'd by it more than ever the Bill, or the Houſe it ſelf, intended; for in all their Arguments for the Bill, 'tis ſuppos'd to be a Means to Reduce, Humble, and Mortifie the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters; <hi>Ridiculus Mus!</hi> Is this all? Why really, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, had it been in our Power, you ſhould have had all this without an Act of Parliament; this will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0454100800:165"/>
Strengthen, not Reduce, us; 'twill pleaſe, not Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie or Humble, us; and thus you find your ſelves all Miſtaken, Miſtaken in the Houſe of Commons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in thinking the Repreſentatives of a Proteſtant Nation will Repeal the Act of Toleration, upon which the Tranquility of their Native Country ſo much depends, but above all Miſtaken in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Queen, to whom their Behaviour is Prepoſterous and Unmannerly.</p>
            <p>'Twas prepoſterous for People to expect, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Queen was a Friend to the Church, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Member, and always Eſpouſed the Intereſt of the Church, that therefore when She came to the Crown, She muſt come up to all their extravagant Heights.</p>
            <p>When Her Majeſty was Princeſs, and a Subject, ſhe conſtantly adher'd to the Intereſt of the Church; but at the ſame time declar'd Her Opinion for tolerating the Diſſenters in their Liberty of Proteſtant Worſhip, while they behaved themſelves quietly and obediently under the Government.</p>
            <p>When Her Majeſty came to the Crown, She became the general Mother, the Guardian, the Refuge of all Her Subjects; She places the Church firſt in Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, promiſes them Her ſpecial and particular care, as thoſe who by Judgment and Inclination She ſtands engaged with; but as She finds a great Number of Her People unhappily divided in Opinion, yet in all other Reſpects Her good Subjects, what can She do leſs than give them Her Protection? This She has readily promis'd them, and on this they thankfully depend,</p>
            <p>But here comes the Gentlemen of the Long Gown, and they tell her in ſo many Words, She cannot, She muſt not keep her Word with us; They tell us She will halt between God and <hi>Baal,</hi> if She does not ſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for the Church, as to her Beſt to Suppreſs and deſtroy all Separate Worſhips, and have all the Prieſts
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0454100800:166"/>
of <hi>Baal,</hi> the beſt Terms they can beſtow on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Miniſters, hew'd to Pieces before the Lord.</p>
            <p>'Tis Unmannerly that the Church of <hi>England-</hi>men ſhou'd expect the Queen to break Her word with ſome of Her Subjects to oblige others; and that whereas She has promis'd them Her Special Favour, they ſhou'd not be content with that, unleſs She will at the ſame time Oppreſs Two Millions of her Faithful People to oblige them.</p>
            <p>Let them go on, but let them be aſſur'd the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall enjoy their Liberty of Conſcience, till they can prevail with Her Majeſty to lay aſide her Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and forget Her Royal Word, and refuſe us Her Protection, which we are reſolved never to give Her any Reaſon for.</p>
            <p>As to the Bill againſt Occaſional Conformity, it baulks their Deſign on the Diſſenters, for 'tis for their Advantage; they always diſlik'd the Practice; it has more than once been Proteſted againſt, and Exploded, and I dare undertake not one Diſſenter offers to preſent a Petition to the Houſe againſt its paſſing.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain, that Occaſional Communion is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a Diſſenter; who, if he can Conform, ought to Conform; and if he can for a Place of Preferment, ought to do it without that Preferment.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain, that whatever, by the Connivance of Remiſs Miniſters, and with too much Regard to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may have been ſlightly paſs'd over, yet by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſtitution and Foundation of a collected, ſeparate Church or Congregation, no Man can go back to the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved again upon any other Condition but as a Penitent; 'tis an Act Deſtructive of all poſſible Pretence for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and never was, nor never can, be defended by any Diſſenter, without over-throwing all the Reaſons they cou'd ever give for Diſſenting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0454100800:167"/>
How then can this Bill be aim'd at the Diſſenters? either they who think 'tis aim'd at them, are Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; or they that point it at them, are Miſtaken, for Suppreſſing an Error crept in among them, contrary to their Conſtitution, againſt their Judgment, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them to be a Grievance, can never be their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, nor ought to be their Trouble.</p>
            <p>Let them Name us the Diſſenter that ever vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Practice, one paſſionate Author excepted; let them tell us the Time when any Congregation recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch conforming Nonconformatiſts without diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions and Diſcontents; let them tell us a Time whenever the thing was practic'd till the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a Novelty, an Abuſe crept in among us, and we are glad to have it Condemn'd by Authority; at the ſame Time not at all thinking our ſelves oblig'd to the Authors for their Good Will.</p>
            <p>'Twill be objected, this is a Feint, to cloſe with a thing when you cannot help it.</p>
            <p>No, Gentlemen, we don't tell you we like that part of the Bill which Excludes us from the Native Honours and Preferments of our Country, which are our Due, our Birthright, equally with our Neighbours, and to which we ſhould be call'd by the Suffrage of the People; and we cannot but think it a Hardſhip beyond the Power of Reaſon to juſtifie; but ſince this Right muſt be clogg'd with ſo many Inconveniencies, that we muſt Mortgage our Conſciences to enjoy them, no Man can have any Charity left for us, but muſt preſently conclude we ſhall freely forego ſuch Trifles for our Conſciences, or elſe that we may have no Conſciences at all.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>'tis no Feint;</hi> we are ſo content with the Suppreſſing the Grievance of this Scandalous <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo-dexter Conformity,</hi> that we think the Hardſhips put upon us with it not worth naming; we doubt not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0454100800:168"/>
the Parliament will one time or other ſee Cauſe to do us Juſtice, and to reſtore to us the Priviledges of our Anceſtors, and which we have done nothing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</p>
            <p>But all the Parliaments that ever were, or will be, can never Suppreſs any thing among us ſo Scandalous to our Reputation, and to that Candour with which we deſire to Guide our Actions, nor ſo Contrary to, and Deſtructive of, the very Nature of our ſeparating from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Conſtitution of all our Collected Congregations.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge, that if this was an allow'd Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice among us, we cou'd not pretend the Character of a Diſſenter I have here given to be Juſt; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Queſtion it is a moſt Juſt Character of all thoſe Diſſenters who are Conſciencious and Honeſt; 'tis the Original, the Nature, of a Diſſenter; what is crept in more is a Corruption, and we wiſh it Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and ſince none has ſaid any thing of this Nature but what has been ſaid before, and no Church of <hi>England-</hi>Man can think or ſpeak worſe of it than the truly Religious Diſſenters have done, we freely diſmiſs all thoſe who can thus Build with one Hand, and Pull Down with another, to a Liberty of declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the future who they are for.</p>
            <p>Only purſuant to what has all along been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, ſo far as we handl'd this Argument, if they wou'd accept of the Friendly Advice of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it ſhould be, that they would for the future Conform to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis plain, he that can Conform to the Church to qualifie himſelf for Preferment, for Employment, or any ſuch Reaſon, can Conform; if not, he muſt be arrived to a Degree of Maſterſhip over his Conſcience ſo as to ſubject it to his Intereſt, and act againſt light; and he that can do that, may do any thing, and 'tis no matter what Church he communicates with; of ſuch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0454100800:169"/>
a Man I think I Treſpaſs not upon Charity to ſay, he has all his Work of Religion to do over again, and he alſo may Conform till God ſhall give his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Light enough to chuſe by, and him Grace to be Obedient to the Convictions of his own Heart, and whether that be to Conform or Diſſent, let him judge</p>
            <p>But if any Man who has profeſt himſelf a Religious Diſſenter, ſhall, upon the paſſing this Act, declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Reſolv'd to turn to the Diſſenters, I think no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Diſſenters, according to the Nature of Religious Communion, can receive him upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terms than as a <hi>Penitent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If he has not Sinn'd, why ſhou'd he Repent?</hi> Says a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author in this very Caſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, he either has Sinn'd in Conforming, or he Sinn'd in Diſſenting before, or he Sins in coming off; for if he did not Sin in Conforming, he ought to have continued there, and his coming off is a plain Schiſm; but if he did Sin, he ought to acknowledge the Sin, which is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent.</p>
            <p>I am told after all this, but upon what Authority do you write thus? You take upon you to write in the Name of the Diſſenters, what Commiſſion have you to write in the Plural? And how do we know that the Diſſenters diſown this Occaſional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Publication is an Appeal to the World; if I have wrote what is not true, or affirm'd that in the Name of the Diſſenters which is not their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I am liable to an eaſie Confutation; but as I have never yet had my Argument refuted, ſo tho' I have not received a Formal Commiſſion, Truth is a General Commiſſion, and any Man may write it.</p>
            <p>And yet I am not without a general Concurrence of all the Diſſenters I ever converſt with: and he that can anſwer the Argument is welcome to Make his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative as Publick as this, and let the World judge who is in the Right.</p>

            <p>As the Church of <hi>England</hi> Party have boaſted of their own Loyalty, ſo they have branded the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Rebellion and Faction, not only in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in their very Principles; they have laid it down in their Writings and Sermons, and Multitudes of their ignorant Hearers believe it, that <hi>the very Doctrine of the Diſſenter is made up of Principles in their own Nature tending to Confuſion and Rebellion;</hi> they wo'n't be content that we ſhou'd own there may be Men among all Parties of bad Deſigns, and who wou'd on all Occaſions embroil their Native Country; but it muſt be woven with the very Articles of Faith; and that 'tis the Religion of a Diſſenter to diſturb Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, kill Kings, and oppoſe Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Phanatical Enemies of our King and Church,</hi> ſays the Learned Dr. <hi>P—n, drink in Rebellion as Water; 'tis the very Subſtance of their Schiſmatical Doctrine to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm and deſtory; and Commonwealths and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the Doctrines they preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that lays out one Groat with a Diſſenter (ſays the worthy Sir <hi>Roger</hi> in one of his Famous <hi>Obſervators)</hi> contributes ſo much as the Profits of that Groat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to in Trade, towards the Subverſion of the Monarchy, and Erecting a Common-wealth, for the very Nature and Tendency of their Profeſſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0454100800:173"/>
of Kingly Power, and the Government of the Nation.</p>
            <p>This has been the Opinion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both of themſelves on one Hand, and of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters on the other Hand. I ſhou'd be glad if I cou'd only ſay, <hi>It has been,</hi> for we find 'tis ſtill too much their Opinion.</p>
            <p>Let no Man ſay that the Author of theſe Sheets is either widening or keeping unheal'd the Breaches of this Nation; for if I can make it appear that there is really no Occaſion of ſuch unnatural Diviſions; and that neither the extraordinary Opinion of themſelves, nor the Contempt of their Neighbours, as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Loyalty, is a becoming Principle; no, nor a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional one neither: For that as to Loyalty, Paſſive-Obedience, Non-Reſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is really no great Difference between one ſide or other; I go as far towards healing the Breach as any Man; for there can be no better way to end the Strife on both Sides, than to prove that neither Side has any juſt Cauſe to contend.</p>
            <p>To examine the Matter on both Sides, ſeems very uſeful at this time, in order to reconcile Parties, and to ſettle the Univerſal Character of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Government of <hi>England,</hi> is a limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, compoſed of King, Lords, and Commons; each have their ſeveral, their ſeparate, and their conjunctive Powers; which acting in Concert, make the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Conſtitution. I ſhall not invade the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of thoſe learned Gentlemen, who have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſet forth the Branches of the Conſtitution in all their Powers, Limitations and Prerogatives: 'Tis enough to ſay the Conſtitution is known, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is confin'd by Laws, the Crown limited by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and the Peoples Rights confirm'd by the Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ages.</p>
            <p>To this Government, all Diſtinction of Names ſet
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0454100800:174"/>
apart, I am of the Opinion all Parties have in their Turns been equally Loyal; I was going to ſay, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſloyal: And if I were to uſe the Language of late Times, it wou'd be a very proper way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Affirming without demonſtrating is an abſurd way of arguing, and therefore it will be needful to come to Particulars, and to examine the ſeveral Acts and Deeds of both Parties when the Kingly Prerogative has ſhock'd or claſh'd with the People.</p>
            <p>In order to this 'tis needful co examine the Date of the Difference, and ſo enter a little into Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Our firſt Reformation from Popery was in the Days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. I call it the firſt, becauſe 'twas under him that the whole Nation and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment embrac'd the Proteſtant Reform'd Religion; this Proteſtant Religion was eſtabliſh'd by <hi>that Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous King,</hi> and by his Parliament, back'd with the force of Laws, and confirm'd by all the Sanction of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it was capable of, and here it began to be call'd the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some enquiring Chriſtians were for making farther Steps, and carrying on the Reformation to a higher Degree; and if that good reforming King had liu'd, his Zeal and Integrity was ſuch, that there was no doubt he wou'd have gone on to perfect every thing he had begun, as new Light or more Knowledge had encreaſed; but the Return of Popery under Queen <hi>Mary</hi> put a Stop to the Work in general, and went very far towards overturning the whole Structure of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reſtor'd it again; but as ſhe was a Zealous Proteſtant Queen, yet ſhe was not for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Reformation to any Amendment. Not that ſhe believ'd it perfect; but ſhe was a Politick Princeſs, ſurrounded with Enemies that were not to be dally'd with; and ſhe was loth to ſuppoſe ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0454100800:175"/>
in the Reformation as were alledg'd, becauſe 'twas to leſſen the Reputation of it, and conſequently her Intereſt in the World.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who inſiſted upon the further Reformation were then call'd <hi>Puritans,</hi> becauſe they ſet up for a greater Purity of Worſhip; and they ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the eſtabliſh'd Church, becauſe, as they ſaid, their Conſciences inform'd them they cou'd ſerve God more agreeable to his Will.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not meddle with the Arguments made uſe of on both Sides, either to defend or expoſe this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; 'tis ſufficient to acquaint my Reader that this is the true Original of the Diſſenters: We are now to examine a little further back. Before this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation there was no ſuch thing as Church of <hi>England,</hi> it was then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that was the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd National Church.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants under the Titles of <hi>Lollards, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffians, Huſſites,</hi> &amp;c. what did they do? Did they, <hi>as our Modern People ſay every Body ſhou'd,</hi> conform to what the Government commanded? No, the preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> Party were the Diſſenters, the Schiſmaticks and Phanaticks, in the Days of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VIII. were perſecuted for not coming to Church, many of them put to Death, and always treated with Scorn and Contempt, as Enemies to the Government, Broachers of new Opinions, and Contemners of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as in the Caſe of that Famous Proto-Martyr of Chriſt's Church, <hi>John Lambert,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>In the next Ages theſe come to have the Power in their Hands, and forgetting that they had found it <hi>Righteous in the Sight of God to obey God rather than Man,</hi> they treat thoſe whoſe Conſciences oblige them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them with the ſame Contempt which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had receiv'd from the <hi>Roman</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>Thus far they are upon even Terms, as to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Superiors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0454100800:176"/>
The Diſſenters have the firſt Occaſion after this to ſhow their Submiſſion under extraordinary Preſſures. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> diſcountenanc'd them continually, and as good a Queen as ſhe was, put ſome of them to Death. King <hi>James</hi> I. hunted them quite out of the Kingdom, made Thouſands of them fly into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the long Reign of theſe Two Princes we find no charge of Treaſon or Rebellion upon them; they bore the Diſpleaſure of their Princes with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Paſſive Obedience, <hi>if I may be allow'd that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Phraſe;</hi> being perſecuted in one City, they fled to another; they bore illegal Proſecutions, and things contrary to their Right, as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, but never took up Arms againſt their Prince.</p>
            <p>Under the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Caſe alter'd, the King and Parliament fell out about Matters of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Right, and Invaſion of the Liberty and Properties of the People, the <hi>Puritans</hi> or Diſſenters, call them what we pleaſe, fell in unanimouſly with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And here 'tis worthy Remark, that the firſt Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the King and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament did not Reſpect Religion but Civil Property; nor were the Majority of the Houſe <hi>Puritans,</hi> but true Church Proteſtants, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, who ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rights of the People, as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men; and none were more Zealous in the firſt Diſputes than the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth,</hi> and ſuch as were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deep Sufferers for the King.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament finding the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party ſtuck cloſe to their Cauſe, they alſo came over them when Things came to a Rupture, and ſo the War begun on the Score of Right, Invaſion of Liberty, Breach of the Laws, Private Leagues, and Male-Adminiſtration, a Game we have ſeen play'd over again by the very ſame Church of <hi>England</hi> that have exclaim'd ſo much againſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0454100800:177"/>
it, ſo damn'd it, and ſo damn'd themſelves, by Oaths, Declarations, Teſts, and God knows what againſt it.</p>
            <p>'Tis allow'd here the Puritan broke thro' his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and his former Obedience, and fought his Way to the Liberty he demanded. Well, the War ended to his Advantage, he ſubdued his Soveraign, and brought him to the Block, to the Aſtoniſhment of the whole World.</p>
            <p>I won't diſpute here which or which Party did or did not do it; but to give the Enemy all juſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I am willing to grant it in the largeſt Sence that the Diſſenters, or Phanaticks, or Whigs, call them as you pleaſe, did embrue their Hands in the Blood of the Lord's Anointed, put to Death that Bleſſed Martyr, King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. whom the Learned Divine, in a Sermon on the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> before the Parliament, compares both in the manner of his Sufferings, and the People by whom, to our Saviour and the Jews, and boldly runs on in the Blaſphemous Parallel, to ſhew that the Indignities and Sufferings of King <hi>Charles</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I think I have granted as largely as a fair Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary can deſire, for I have yielded, for Peace-ſake, to ſeveral Things which I cou'd fairly diſprove.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall I return to a Repetition of the ill Uſage the Diſſenters have receiv'd from the contrary Party on this Account for above 30 Years; the conſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches they and their Children after them have met with from thoſe Gentlemen, who on all Occaſions have (as I hinted before) particularly taken care to extol their own unſhaken Fidelity to their Prince, till at laſt an Occaſion preſents to touch them in the ſame moſt ſenſible Part, <hi>their Right and Property;</hi> and <hi>alas!</hi> Their Loyalty, what became of it? Truly the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Paſſively Obedient, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſhakenly Loyal,</hi> Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Original Nature of their Neighbours, and did the ſame thing exactly which the Whigs, <hi>the Factious Rebellious Whigs,</hi> had done before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0454100800:178"/>
               <hi>No, that's falſe,</hi> (ſays a Diſciple of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s) <hi>we did not Kill our King, we did not dip our Hands in Royal Blood, nor hurt the Lords Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, that's true, but the Lords Anointed may thank himſelf for that; for my part I think the Difference only lyes here; the Whigs in 41, to 48, took up Arms againſt their King, and having Conquer'd him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him Priſoner, and having taken him Priſoner, cut off his Head, <hi>becauſe they had begun:</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> took Arms againſt their King in 88, and did not cut off his Head, <hi>becauſe they had him not.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> loſt his Life, <hi>becauſe he did not run away;</hi> and his Son, King <hi>James,</hi> ſav'd his Life, <hi>becauſe he did run away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſuch a Jeſt, ſuch a Banter, to ſay, We did take up Arms, but we did not kill him: <hi>Bleſs us, Kill our King, we wou'd not have hurt a Hair of his Head!</hi> Why, every Bullet ſhot at the Battel of the <hi>Boyne</hi> was a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King; for if you did not, 'twas becauſe you cou'd not hit him.</p>
            <p>If a Highway-man Fires at you upon the Road, when he is taken, and brought upon his Trial, our Learned Recorder, before he pronounces Sentence of Death, Harangues him in this manner: <hi>And beſides all this, Sir, you are plainly guilty of Murther; for you not only aſſaulted this Honeſt Man in order to take away his Money, but you endeavoured to Murther him; for you ſhot at him in order to kill him; and the Intention of Murther is equally Criminal in the Eyes of God with the Act it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who did we ſhoot at at the <hi>Boyne? 'Tis true, King</hi> James <hi>generally ſtood out of the way:</hi> But who did we Shoot at? What! Was our Orders to <hi>fight againſt both ſmall and great, and not againſt the King of</hi> Iſrael? Had your Bullets Commiſſion to ſhew their Loyalty, and not to touch the Lords Anointed? If he had charg'd in the firſt Squadrons of his Horſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0454100800:179"/>
had you not kill'd him if you cou'd? I think this needs no further Proof.</p>
            <p>Nay, if Arguments may be allow'd to have equal Weight on both ſides, the Whigs have been the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter of the two, for they never profeſt any ſuch blind, abſolute and undiſputed Obedience to Princes, as the others have done.</p>
            <p>It has always been their Opinion, That Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Originally contrived by the Conſent, and for the mutual Benefit of the Parties Govern'd, that the People have an Original Native Right to their Property, the Liberty of their Perſons and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>unleſs forefaulted to the Laws;</hi> that they cannot be diveſted of their Right but by their own Conſent; and that all Invaſion of this Right is deſtructive of the Conſtitution, and diſſolves the Compact of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience.</p>
            <p>They have always declar'd, That they underſtand their Allegiance to their Governors to be, <hi>ſuppoſing they Govern them according to the Laws of the Land;</hi> and that if Princes break this Bond of Government, the Nature of it is inverted, and the Conſtitution ceaſes of courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buchanan</hi> in <hi>Scotland, Algernoon Sidney</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> have ſet their Names, and the latter his Blood, to this Doctrine; and the Author of the <hi>True-born Engliſhman</hi> is worth quoting in this Caſe.<q>
                  <l>The Government's ungirt when Juſtice dies,</l>
                  <l>And Conſtitutions are Non-Entities:</l>
                  <l>The Nation's all a Mob, there's no ſuch thing</l>
                  <l>As Lords or Commons, Parliament or King:</l>
                  <l>A great promiſcuous Crowd the <hi>Hydra</hi> lyes,</l>
                  <l>Till Laws revive, and mutual Contract ties:</l>

                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0454100800:180"/>
If to a King they do the Reins commit,</l>
                  <l>All Men are bound in Conſcience to ſubmit;</l>
                  <l>But then that King muſt by his Oath aſſent</l>

                  <l>Which if he breaks, he cuts off the Entail,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This has been the avow'd Doctrine of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and is indeed the true Senſe of the Conſtitution it ſelf; purſuant to this Doctrine they thought they had a Right to oppoſe Violence with Force; believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that when Kings break Coronation Oaths, the Solemn Compact with their People, and encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Civil Rights, contrary to the Laws of the Land, by which they are Sworn to Rule, they ceaſe to be the Lord's Anointed any longer; the Sanction of their Office is vaniſh'd, and they become Tyrants and Enemies of Mankind, and may be treated accordingly.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis no wonder to find People of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples vigorouſly withſtanding their Governors when they tread upon the tender ſore Places of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, 'tis nothing but what they all along pretended to, and declar'd to be their Opinion.</p>

            <p>The Clergy, all the Magiſtrates and Officers of the Houſhold, of the Civil or Military Government, were Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> otherwiſe they cou'd not be employ'd; the Sacramental Teſt has done the Diſſenters this Kindneſs, that 'tis plain all the Managing Hands in the Kingdom were Diſciples of the Church; and as an additional Circumſtance, the Oath of Allegiance which they took, and which

Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are all Apoſtates from the very Fundamental Doctrine of their Church, Perjur'd in the Sight of God and Man, Notorious Hypocrites, and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; who having ſworn Obedience without Reſerve to their Prince, are become Traitors, Rebels, and Murtherers of the Lord's Anointed, and their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign; and not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, have depos'd and traiterouſly dethron'd their Rightful King, God Almighty's Vicegerent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to no Earthly Power, Supream under God, Abſolute, and, from Divine Inſtitution, Undoubted Sole Lord of them and their Country.</p>
            <p>Or, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That they only are the true Church of <hi>England,</hi> who according to their avow'd Profeſſion, have firmly adher'd to their King in all his Sufferings and Solitude, have never blacken'd their Conſciences, nor gone back from their Obedience, forgotten their Oaths, nor ſullied their Reputation with the horrid Crimes of Treaſon and Rebellion, as they think it to be.</p>
            <p>Now, as a fair Diſputant, I am willing the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhall chuſe which of theſe three Conſequences he will ſtand by in Behalf of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Loyalty; but if they wou'd take the Advice of <hi>a Friend to the Honeſt Part of them,</hi> I wou'd recommend the firſt Concluſion to be fitteſt for them for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſince Humane Infallibility is <hi>(and with good Reaſon)</hi> diſown'd by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both for her ſelf and every Body elſe, it can be no Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to her Reputation, when ſhe has found her ſelf miſtaken, and impos'd upon, to acknowledge her Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; <hi>a wiſe Man will always own, rather than defend a Miſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe 'tis my Opinion that their Way is hedg'd up againſt any other Pretence, Evaſion, or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0454100800:184"/>
Reſervation, and therefore 'tis with me the only thing that Charity can ſay for them, and muſt remain ſo, till I find ſomething elſe ſaid that is more to the Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But the Miſchief of all is, that if this be honeſtly acknowledg'd <hi>(as is doubtleſs moſt true)</hi> that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was miſtaken, and impos'd upon, to eſpouſe a Senſleſs Abſurd Principle, contrary to the Nature of Government and Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why then they come over to this Conſequence;</p>
            <p>That Government and Allegiance are both Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and Oaths of Subjects are always to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in a Conſtructive Sence, with Conditions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and the like; a thing which is without queſtion the real Meaning of all Oaths of Allegiance; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Subjects may be put under an Abſolute Neceſſity of Perjury, or State Martyrdom, by often Swearing what may be impoſſible for them to perform.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Aeth</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> has been about Six Times, and the Town of <hi>Rhinebergh</hi> in <hi>Gueldre</hi> about Twelve Times, Taken and Retaken; and as often as new Maſters had Poſſeſſion of the Place, ſo often the poor Inhabitants have ſworn to their new Lords: What can the Meaning of ſuch an Oath be, but that they will be faithful to them ſo long as they keep Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Place? 'Twou'd be ridiculous to imagine the Impoſers of the Oath requir'd any more.</p>
            <p>If our Zealous Churchmen worded an Oath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the very Nature of Swearing Allegiance, let them anſwer for it who firſt made it, then took it, then broke it: But the Nature of the thing can leave Room for no other Suggeſtion that I know of.</p>
            <p>Till then ſome further Argument is produc'd, it muſt reſt here, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, Impoſed upon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſhe finds when the Laws are Broken, the Right of the People Invaded, the Root of the Government Struck at, Church and State Undermin'd, and Deſpotick Tyranny at the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0454100800:185"/>
Door, the Native Right of the People is Superior, and they may aſſume a Power to Right themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo we are brought back to Whiggiſm and Forty. One; and Gentlemen, there is no Remedy for it, help it if ye can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where now is the Difference between Church Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and Whiggiſh Loyalty, Roundhead or Cavalier, Churchman or Diſſenter, Whig or Troy? All are alike; they are pleas'd, when legally Govern'd, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome and Unruly, if Oppreſt; and will Defend themſelves, if Aſſaulted, tho' it be by their Kings, or any Body elſe.</p>
            <p>Why then is the Difference kept up? Methinks they might all be Friends together, for they are all alike; the Diſſenters have been in their times as Loyal, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> in their time as Diſloyal, one as another. <hi>Vice verſa;</hi> the Diſſenters have been as Diſloyal, and the Churchmen as Loyal, as one another upon the ſame Occaſion; they have been both Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, and have ſubmitted to the Government; ay, and to the Oppreſſions and Perſecutions of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors and Soveraigns; and again, upon the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, they have both of them been Rebels. <hi>if their own Language may be ſo far uſed;</hi> they have both of them, in their Turn, taken Arms againſt, and depos'd their Rightful and Lawful Kings.</p>
            <p>So that in my Opinion, <hi>with a Latitude to all that think otherwiſe, to think as they pleaſe,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and their Neighbours the Diſſenters, have nothing to quarrel with one another about, as to Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; as to other Matters I have nothing to ſay to them, nor ſhall not mingle it with this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think I am writing a Satyr againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor is it at all intended to be ſo; and to ſtop all Pretences that way, I take the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſay, here has been no Crime, the Church of <hi>England</hi> has been in the right of it; not in taking Arms, but the Error was in Eſpouſing, Crying up, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0454100800:186"/>
Pretending to a Blind Abſolute Obedience to Princes, be their Commands never ſo Abſolute, Tyrannical or Illegal; this neither the Doctrine nor Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor of any Church or People in the Chriſtian World, ever pretended to; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fanlt lay in thoſe People, who being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſuffer'd themſelves to be deluded by State Miniſters, to foſter a Tenent upon the Church, which her Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution never pretended to, and then call it the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt beginning of their pretended Doctrine was found in <hi>Manwaring</hi>'s and <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s Libels, in the Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. cajoling the King; and then to pleaſe him, endeavouring to wheedle the People into a Belief of the Divine Right of Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and affirming, that the King was not oblig'd by the Laws in the Adminiſtration of the Government.</p>
            <p>Upon this prepoſterons Foundation they built the Illegitimate Structure of Abſolute Undiſputed Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for if Kingly Power were once prov'd to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deriv'd from Divine Authority, Abſolute Obedience wou'd be a Conſequence no Body cou'd diſpute, ſince the ſame Obedience without Reſerve wou'd be due to the Delegated Power, as to the Power Delegating.</p>
            <p>And tho' this is a Point eaſily enough confuted, yet being willing to keep the preſent Diſpute within as ſmall a Compaſs we can, I think our Argument has nothing at all to do with it.</p>
            <p>Whether Government be of Divine Original or not, ſeems not the Queſtion here; for if it be not ſo, then, as before, the Church of <hi>England</hi> have been Miſtaken, and Impoſed upon; and if it be ſo, then the Church of <hi>England</hi> has trampled under Foot their own Doctrine, turn'd Rebels to God, and Apoſtates from the Faith they have profeſt, have Sacrilegiouſly and Traiterouſly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0454100800:187"/>
taken up Arms againſt their Prince, aſſaulted the Lords Anointed, <hi>reſiſted the Powers, which are the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,</hi> depoſed their Lawful Soveraign, broken their Allegiance, and conſequently <hi>are a Parcel of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Rebels;</hi> every Jot as bad as the worſt Roundhead Regicide, and Rebel of the Year Forty-One.</p>
            <p>What more or leſs can be ſaid I profeſs I know not, and am in great Expectation of ſomething new in the Matter; for I cannot find in all the Writings I have met with, any thing to contradict it.</p>
            <p>The bringing Government and Obedience to the proper Circumſtances of mutual Compact between King and People, ſeems to me to be the only Method to unravel this Skein of entangl'd Principles; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Government has made it the neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all Argument relating to Power; and I cou'd give Inſtances in all the Nations in the World, that ſome time or other, even the Right of Succeſſion to Government, <hi>which muſt be as Sacred as the Power,</hi> has been Interrupted and Limited by the People, in caſe of Tyranny and Illegal Governing; and every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and this among the reſt,</hi> has oftentimes Depos'd their Princes for the Preſervation of the State, when either Incapacity for Government, Tyrannical Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, or other Male-Adminiſtration, has been the Caſe.</p>
            <p>But this I think alſo needleſs here; every one that is vers'd in Hiſtory can read the numerous Examples in the <hi>Roman, Grecian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Hiſtories, <hi>even Sacred Hiſtories, where Kings were more particularly of Divine Right than any where,</hi> are full of them; the Hiſtories of <hi>Spain, Portugal, France, Lombardy,</hi> the Empires of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> even the Papal Chair, have ſuffer'd Convulſions and Revolutions, the Depoſing and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing their Soveraigns, when the Peoples Good, <hi>which is, and ever was, the Soul, the Center, the End, and the Cauſe of all Government,</hi> came to be in the Diſpute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0454100800:188"/>
But to return to the Principles of the Two Parties we are now diſcourſing of; the Whigs, as before, have always aſſerted this to be their Notion of Government and Governors; and the Church of <hi>England, however ſome among them have topt an empty Notion upon them,</hi> have all along, and <hi>now at laſt once for all,</hi> own'd it by their Practice.<q>
                  <l>That Kings when they deſcend to Tyranny,</l>
                  <l>Diſſolve the Bond, and leave the Subject free.</l>

            </p>
            <p>The Act for the further Limitation of the Crown paſt in the laſt Parliament, and the Right of the People therein Declar'd and Recogniz'd, I wou'd ask my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent whoſe Act and Deed it was? Will they ſay it was a Whiggiſh Act, made by a Phanatical Houſe of Commons? <hi>I dare ſay there was not Ten Diſſenters in the Houſe;</hi> let them deſcend with us into Particulars, let them draw out a <hi>Black Liſt</hi> of Members, who in that Loyal Honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament gave their Hands to the laſt Settlement and Declaration of Right, and let us <hi>tell Noſes,</hi> and put a Brand upon the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>Will they tell us it was a <hi>Phanatical Parliament</hi> that ſet the Crown upon the Queens Head? I hope they will own Her Majeſty, and their Lordſhips the Biſhops, are part of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for if the Head and the principal Members are not, we know not who are.</p>
            <p>Will they tell us that Sir <hi>E. S.</hi> Sir <hi>B. S.</hi> Sir <hi>J. B.</hi> Mr, <hi>H—y,</hi> Sir <hi>C—r M—ve,</hi> and a Hundred more of that Side, were Whigs and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth-Men?</p>
            <p>How comes it to paſs in <hi>England,</hi> that no <hi>Papiſt</hi> can inherit? <hi>Divine Right</hi> ought to ſupercede all Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>the Young Prince of</hi> Savoy, not the <hi>Houſe of Hannover</hi> ought to Reign with a <hi>Non Obſtante</hi> to all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0454100800:189"/>
Humane Limitation, if all was from Heaven? Where are our Right Line-Men now! Why, truly the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is plain, the <hi>Church of England, People of England, a Church of England, Parliament of England,</hi> have thought fit to Declare, that for the Good of the People <hi>to which all Right of Succeſſion to Power muſt give way, becauſe from them all Power it ſelf does derive,</hi> and by the Voice of that people (in which Authority ſufficient is Legally Grounded) it is Unanimouſly agreed, that <hi>we will not have a Papiſt to Reign over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is too plain to admit of a Diſpute; and now to me it ſeems Prepoſterous why any Men ſhou'd keep up the Diſtinction between Parties as to Loyalty, when indeed there is no manner of Difference in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>I have talk'd ſeveral times of Bearing, Suffering, being Perſecuted and Oppreſs'd, as the Diſſenters in their time have been more than enough, and again in their Turn the Church of <hi>England</hi> have been Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted too; for as I noted before, they were once the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> the <hi>Whigs,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Now I think 'tis not very foreign to my Argument to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether of the Two behav'd themſelves under their Sufferings with the greateſt Submiſſion, who ſhow'd moſt Abſolute Obedience to their Superiors, and who <hi>firſt, or ofteneſt, rebell'd</hi> againſt their Lawful Soveraign.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. were the firſt Diſſenters; they were kept Under, Perſecuted, and put to Death as Rebels and Schiſmaticks. Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due Search it will be fouhd, that under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Two Proteſtant Queens, Wives of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. they had more than once form'd ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at Court, and in the Kingdom, as to begin to be formidable to the Popiſh Powers then reigning; and the Fall of the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> was thought a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Policy in King <hi>Henry,</hi> to prevent the Plots of the <hi>Phanatical Church of</hi> England <hi>Hereticks;</hi> a long Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0454100800:190"/>
of which may be read in the Life of that Prince.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. a Zealous and pious Prince, made no Scruple for the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> of which he was the Glorious Founder, to ſet Aſide the Lawful and Undiſputed Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his own Siſters, to Eſtabliſh the Crown in the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> who he knew wou'd carry on the Work of Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There's an Inſtance of the Zeal for Succeſſion in the Right Line in the Firſt Proteſtant Head that ever the Church of</hi> England <hi>had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the Goſpellers, <hi>that is, the Church of</hi> England <hi>Proteſtants of</hi> Suffolk, having ſome Senſe of Injury done to the <hi>Princeſs Mary,</hi> and willing to have the Succeſſion go on in the Right Line, provided they cou'd both preſerve their Religion and Loyalty too; Capitulate with her, and promiſe to ſtand by her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe wou'd promiſe to preſerve, and make no Alteration, in their Eſtabliſh'd Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men own'd the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Religion to be Superior to their Loyalty to her; and that they had a Right to Submit, or not to Submit, as their Liberty was, or was not, Secure: and accordingly Condition'd with her before they wou'd Acknowledge her to be their Queen.</p>
            <p>And we ſee how Heaven puniſh'd them for venturing on the Word of a <hi>Prince</hi> when their Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was at Stake.</p>
            <p>In this Queen's Time the Church having been again Suppreſs'd, and Popery Erected, Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> an honeſt Church of <hi>England</hi> Proteſtant, with a very good Body of Men, took up Arms againſt their Lawful Princeſs for breaking her Word, in Defence of their <hi>Dear Religion Eſtabliſh'd by Bleſſed King</hi> Edward, which were the very Words of the Manifeſto they Publiſh'd: The Londoners, with 800 Men ſent by the Queen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0454100800:191"/>
gainſt them, thought it no Treachery to Deſert their Lawful Popiſh Queen, and go over to their Proteſtant Church of <hi>England</hi> Brethren.</p>
            <p>We have nothing to do with the Juſtification of this Fact, 'tis ſufficient that ſo it was, and that theſe were Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the firſt and pureſt part of their Principles, and let them juſtifie the Fact if they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Succeeds, and then the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhone in its Meridian Glory; and then grew up ſome, who aiming, <hi>as I ſaid before,</hi> at a further Reformation, and the Church refuſing to hearken to it, form'd a new Party of Diſſenters, and theſe were call'd <hi>Puritans,</hi> and ſince that <hi>Phanaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I Challenge the Defender of this Cauſe to tell me one Diſloyal Act, one Plot againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one Diſturbance of the Civil Peace, among theſe Diſſenters, from the beginning of this Queen, which was their own beginning, to the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. which was a continued Term of 80 Years; and yet, during this time, they ſuffer'd all manner of Indignities, Reproaches, Fining, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, Baniſhment, Confiſcations, and Corporal Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>So that hitherto the Paſſive Obedience of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters hath far exceeded that of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Theſe had but Five Years Oppreſſion under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and in that Five Years they once Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated with their Soveraign to make her Queen upon Conditions, and once took Arms againſt her after ſhe was Queen; and <hi>by that</hi> I muſt always underſtand, that if they did not Depoſe and Deſtroy her, it was becauſe they cou'd not; <hi>and if they had done it, no doubt they had Cauſe ſufficient to Juſtifie them before God and Man.</hi> The <hi>Puritans</hi> after this ſuffered all that their <hi>too cruel Brethren</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> laid upon them during Three tedious Reigns, before
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0454100800:192"/>
they ſo much as made the leaſt offer at doing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Juſtice; and for 80 Years together exercis'd that <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> which they never pretended to.</p>
            <p>At laſt they took Arms, and when they did, they did it to purpoſe, carried all before them, ſubdued Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, cut off their Kings Head, and <hi>all that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Reſtoration Things began to return to their old Channel, and 30 Years more the Diſſenters endur'd another <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Servitude, were <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Plunder'd, Indicted, Impriſon'd, Plagu'd</hi> with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Stigmatiz'd with a Thouſand Reproaches, their Meeting-Houſes Demoliſh'd, their Eſtates Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, their Perſons Excommunicated, and Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd, Sworn into <hi>Plots</hi> they never Heard of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Crimes they never Commltted, Dragg'd to Goals, Gibbets and Scaffolds, and the like; <hi>all this while Paſſive-Obedence, if there were any ſuch thing,</hi> was found among them more than any where elſe; for here was no Rebellion, no Inſurrection, nor breaking of the <hi>Peace</hi> by the Diſſenters, notwithſtanding all thoſe Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <p>After this comes King <hi>James</hi> the Second to the Crown, and he turn'd the Scale, and, together with Invaſion of Liberty, falls upon the Church, begins to Rifle her of her Trophies, <hi>for no Eſſentials had been touch'd,</hi> and how long did ſhe bear it? Not 80 Years, not 30 Years, no, not ſo many Months.</p>
            <p>What did ſhe do? Truly nothing but what ſhe ought to have done; Defend her Liberty and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Force, againſt Unjuſt Invaſion and Tyranny: nothing but what all the Nations in the World have done, and wou'd do again if they cou'd.</p>
            <p>The only Error we Charge upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was ſetting up pretences of what they really wou'd not practice; crying up themſelves for Fools, when we knew they were Wiſer Men, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0454100800:193"/>
humble Slaves, but when the Trial came, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Stubborn, Refractory, <hi>Liberty Mongers,</hi> even as bad as the worſt Whig or Phanatick of them all.</p>
            <p>For the future then, if a Humble Mediator might be permitted to give Advice to the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it ſhou'd be in theſe ſhort and friendly Terms.</p>
            <p>Pray Gentlemen never be Impoſed upon, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to more Loyalty, and more ſlaviſh Principles than you intend to practice.</p>
            <p>Never pretend to more Obedience than your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign requires. Our Late King, who I am not aſham'd to ſhow as a Pattern for future Ages, requir'd; and Her preſent Majeſty, <hi>without Affront to Her Majeſty's Authority it may be ſaid,</hi> requires no further Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the People of <hi>England</hi> than the Laws of <hi>England</hi> require.</p>
            <p>To Govern according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the People; and to obey according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the Soveraign. The Laws are the Teſt both of the Royal Authority, and of the Subjects Obedience; and to pretend to more Obedience than the Law requires, is abuſing your Prince, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your Selves.</p>
            <p>Never be aſhamed to own, with <hi>your Brethren the Whigs,</hi> that you are willing to Submit to Authority but that you expect to be govern'd according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm,</p>
            <p>Let the Scoth Motto be ſet upon your Liberties; and according to your conſtant Practice, <hi>as well as theirs;</hi> let all Men know you deſign to make it Good, <hi>Nemo me Impune Laceſſit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it really never was the Principle of the Church of <hi>England, nor were a Hundredth Part of the Members of the Church tainted with it;</hi> ſo for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 'tis hoped you will not ſuffer ſuch to Mingle themſelves among you, or to Act in the Name of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0454100800:194"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who pretend to a Blind Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Obedience to Princes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Gentlemen, a little more Modeſty to your Humble Servants, your Proteſtant Brethren the Diſſenters, or Whigs, I mean as to Matter of Loyalty: For in Truth, Gentlemen, we do not ſee any Reaſon you have to Reproach us in that Matter, you being in every Particular as faulty that way as your Neighbours.</p>

               <p>SIR <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> tells us a Story in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Fables, of the Cock and the Horſes. The Cock was gotten to Rooſt in the Stable, among the Horſes, and there being no Racks, or other Conveniencies for him, it ſeems, he was forc'd to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0454100800:195"/>
Rooſt upon the Ground; the Horſes joſtling about for room and putting the Cock in danger of his Life, he gives them this grave Advice; <hi>Pray Gentlefolks let us ſtand ſtill, for fear we ſhould tread upon one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome People in the World, who now they are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npearcht,</hi> and reduc'd to an Equality with other People, and under ſtrong and very juſt Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of being further Treated as they deſerve, begin, with <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s-Cock, to Preach up Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the Chriſtian Duties of Moderation, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that when they had the Power in their Hands, thoſe Graces were Strangers in their Gates.</p>
               <p>It is now near Fourteen Years that the Glory and Peace of the pureſt and moſt flouriſhing Church in the World has been Eclips'd, Buffetted, and Diſturb'd, by a ſort of Men, who God in his Providence has ſuffer'd to inſult over her, and bring her down; theſe have been the Days of her Humiliation and Tribulation: She has born with an invincible Patience the Reproach of the Wicked, and God has at laſt heard her Prayers, and deliver'd her from the Oppreſſion of the Stranger.</p>
               <p>And now they find their Day is over, their Power gone, and the Throne of this Nation poſſeſt by a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>Engliſh,</hi> True, and ever Conſtant, Member of, and Friend to, the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Now they find that they are in danger of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s juſt Reſentments; now they cry out <hi>Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> as if the Church had not too long harbour'd her Enemies under her Wing, and nouriſh'd the Viperous Brood, till they hiſs and fly in the Face of the Mother that cheriſh'd them.</p>

               <p>We have heard none of this Leſſon for Fourteen Years paſt: We have been huff'd and bully'd with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0454100800:196"/>
your Act of Toleration; you have told us that you are the <hi>Church eſtabliſh'd by Law,</hi> as well as others; have ſet up your <hi>Canting-Synagogues</hi> at our Church-Doors, and the Church and Members have been load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Reproaches, with Oaths, Aſſociations, Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and what not; where has been the Mercy, the forbearance, the Charity, you have ſhewn to <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences of the Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that cou'd not take Oaths <hi>as faſt you made 'em;</hi> that having ſworn Allegiance to their lawful and rightful King, cou'd not dlſpence with that Oath, <hi>their King being ſtill alive,</hi> and ſwear to your new <hi>Hodge-podge of a Dutch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Theſe ha' been turn'd out of their Livings, and they and their Families left to ſtarve; their Eſtates double Tax'd, to carry on a War they had <hi>no Hand in,</hi> and you <hi>got nothing by:</hi> What Account can you give of the Multitudes you have forc'd to comply, againſt their Conſciences, with your new <hi>ſophiſtical Politicks,</hi> who like new Converts in <hi>France,</hi> Sin becauſe they can't Starve. And now the Tables are turn'd upon you, you <hi>muſt not be Perſecuted, 'tis not a Chriſtian Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have <hi>Butcher'd</hi> one King <hi>Depos'd</hi> another King, and made a <hi>mock King</hi> of a Third; and yet you cou'd have the Face to expect to be employ'd and truſted by the Fourth; any Body that did not know the Temper of your Party, wou'd ſtand amaz'd at the Impudence, as well as Fully, to think of it.</p>
               <p>Your Management of your <hi>Dutch Monarch,</hi> whom you reduc'd to a meer <hi>King of Cl—s,</hi> is enough to give any future Princes ſuch an Idea of your Principles, as to warn them ſufficiently from coming into your Clutches; and God be thank'd, the Queen is out of your Hands, knows you, and will have a care of you.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but the ſupream Authority of a Nation has in its ſelf a <hi>Power, and a Right to that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> to execute the Laws upon any part of that Nation it governs. The execution of the known Laws of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0454100800:197"/>
Land, and that with a weak and gentle Hand neither was all this phanatical Party of this Land have ever call'd Perſecution; this they have magnified to a Height, that the Sufferings of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> were not to be compar'd with—Now to execute the known Laws of a Nation upon thoſe who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs them, after voluntarily conſenting to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Laws, can never be call'd Perſecution, but Juſtice. But Juſtice is always Violence to the Party offending, for every Man is Innocent in his own Eyes. The firſt execution of the Laws againſt Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> was in the Days of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt; and what did it amount to, truly, the worſt they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, was at their own requeſt, to let them go to <hi>New-England,</hi> and erect a new Collony, and give them great Priviledges, Grants, and ſuitable Powers, keep them under Protection, and defend them againſt all Invaders, and receive no Taxes or Revenue from them. This was the cruelty of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> fatal Lenity! 'Twas the ruin of that excellent Prince, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. Had King <hi>James</hi> ſent all the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans in <hi>England</hi> away to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> we had been a national, unmix'd, Church; the Church of <hi>England</hi> had been kept undivided and entire.</p>
               <p>To requite the Lenity of the Father, they take up Arms againſt the Son; Conquer, Purſue, Take, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon, and at laſt put to Death, the Anointed of God, and Deſtroy the very Being and Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſetting up a fordid Impoſtor, who had neither Title to Govern, nor Underſtanding to Manage, but ſupplied that want with Power, bloody and deſperate Councils and Craft, without Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Had not King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt withheld the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Laws; had he given them ſtrict Juſtice he had clear'd the Nation of them, and the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had been plain; his <hi>Son had never been Murther'd by them,</hi> nor the Monarchy overwhelm'd; 'twas <hi>too</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0454100800:198"/>
                  <hi>much Mercy</hi> ſhewn them was the ruin of his Poſterity, and the ruin of the Nations Peace. One would think the Diſſenters ſhould not have the Face to believe that we are to be wheedl'd and canted into Peace and Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they know that they have once requited us with a civil War, and once with an intollerable and unrighteous Perſecution for our former Civility.</p>
               <p>Nay to encourage us to be eaſie with them, 'tls ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that they never had the Upper-hand of the Church, but they treated Her with all the Severity; with all the Reproach and Contempt as was poſſible: What Peace, and what Mercy did they ſhew the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Gentry of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Time of their Triumphant Commonwealth? How did they put all the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> to Ranſom, whether they were Actually in Arms for the King or not, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king People compound for their Eſtates, and ſtarve their Families? How did they treat the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſequeſter'd the Miniſters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the Patrimony of the Church, and divided the Spoil, by ſharing the Church-Lands among their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and turning her Clergy out to ſtarve? juſt ſuch Meaſure as they have meted, ſhou'd be meaſur'd them again.</p>
               <p>Charity and Love is the known Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and 'tis plain She has put it in Practice towards the Diſſenters, even beyond what they ought, till She has been wanting to Her Self, and in effect, unkind to own Sons; particularly, in the too much Lenity of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; had he ſo Rooted the Puritans from the Face of the Land, which he had an Opportunity early to ha' done, they had not had the Power to vex the Church, as ſince they have done.</p>
               <p>IN the Days of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, how did the Church reward their Bloody Doings with Lenity and Mercy, <hi>except the Barbarous Regicides of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0454100800:199"/>
                  <hi>Court of Juſtice:</hi> not a Soul ſuffer'd for all the Blood in an Unnatural War: King <hi>Charles</hi> came in all Mercy and Love, cheriſh'd them, prefer'd them, employ'd them, withheld the Rigour of the Law, and oftentimes, even againſt the Advice of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, gave them Liberty of Conſcience; and how did they requite him wich the villainous Contrivance to Depoſe and Murther him and his Succeſſor at the <hi>Rye-Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>KING <hi>James,</hi> as if Mercy was the inherent Quality of the Family, began his Reign with unuſual Favour to them: Nor could their joining with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> againſt him move him to do himſelf Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice upon them; but that miſtaken Prince thought to win them by Gentleneſs and Love, Poclaim'd an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Liberty to them, and rather diſcountenanc'd the Church of <hi>England</hi> than them; how they requited him all the World knows.</p>
               <p>THE late Reign is too freſh in the Memory of all the World to need a Comment; how under Pretence of joining with the Church in redreſſing ſome Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, they puſht Things to that Extremity, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction wirh ſome miſtaken Gentlemen, as to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the late King, as if the Grievance of the Nation cou'd not have been redreſs'd but by the abſolute Ruin of the Prince: Here's an inſtance of their Temper, their Peace, and Charity. To what height they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves during the Reign of a King of their own; how they crope into all Places of Truſt and Profit; how they Inſinuated into the Favour of the King, and were at firſt prefer'd to the higheſt Places in the Nation; how they engroſs'd the Miniſtry, and <hi>above all, how pitifully they Manag'd,</hi> is too plain to need any Remarks.</p>
               <p>BUT particularly their Mercy and Charity, the Spirit of Union, they tell us ſo much of, has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if any Man wou'd ſee the Spirit
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0454100800:200"/>
of a Diſſenter, let him look into <hi>Scotland:</hi> there they made entire Conqueſt of the Church, trampled down the Sacred Orders, and ſuppreſt the Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with an abſolute, and as they ſuppoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievable Victory, tho' 'tis poſſible, <hi>they may find themſelves Miſtaken:</hi> Now 'twou'd be a very proper Queſtion to ask their <hi>Impudent Advocate, the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> Pray how much Mercy and Favour did the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Epiſcopal Church find in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterian Government; and I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Diſſenters ſhall ſtill receive as much here, tho' they deſerve but little.</p>
               <p>In a ſmall Treatiſe of the Sufferings of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'twill appear what Uſage they met with, how they not only loſt their Living, but in ſeveral Places, were plunder'd and abus'd in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the Miniſters that cou'd not Conform, turn'd out with numerous Families, and no Maintenance, and hardly Charity enough left to relieve them with a bit of Bread; and the Cruelties of the Parties are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and not to be attempted in this ſhort Piece.</p>
               <p>And now to prevent the diſtant Cloud which they perceiv'd to hang over their Heads from <hi>England;</hi> with a true <hi>Presbyterian Policy,</hi> they put in for <hi>a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Nations,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> might unite their Church with the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Presbyterian Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſit in our Houſe of Commons, and their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Scotch</hi> canting Long Cloaks in our Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what might have been if our Phanatick, Whiggiſh States-men continu'd, God only knows, but we hope we are out of fear of that now.</p>
               <p>'Tis alled'd by ſome of the Faction, and they began to Bully us with it; that if we won't Unite with them, they will not ſettle the Crown with us again, but when Her Majeſty Dies, will chuſe a King for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0454100800:201"/>
If they won't, we muſt make them, and 'tis not the firſt time we have let them know that we are able. The Crowns of theſe Kingdoms have not ſo far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned the Right of Succeſſion, but they may retrieve it again, and if <hi>Scotland</hi> thinks to come off from a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive to an Elective State of Government, <hi>England</hi> has not promiſed not to aſſiſt the Right Heir, and put them into Poſſeſſion, without any regard to their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Settlements.</p>
               <p>THESE are the Gentlemen, theſe their ways of treating the Church, both at home and abroad. Now let us examine the Reaſons they pretend to give, why we ſhou'd be favourable to them, why we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and tolerate them among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THEY are very Numerous, they ſay, They are a great Part of the Nation, and we cannot Suppreſs them.</p>
               <p>To this may be anſwer'd, 1. THEY are not ſo Numerous as the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> and yet the <hi>French</hi> King effectually clear'd the Nation of them at once, and we don't find he Miſſes them at Home.</p>
               <p>But I am not of the Opinion they are ſo Numerous as is pretended, their Party is more Numerous than their Perſons, and thoſe miſtaken People of the Church who are miſled and deluded by their wheedling Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, to join with them, make their Party the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but thoſe will open their Eyes, when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall ſet heartily about the Work, and come off from them, as ſome Animals, which they ſay, always deſert a Houſe when 'tis likely to fall.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The more Numerous, the more Dangerous and therefore the more Need to Suppreſs them; and God has ſuffer'd us to bear them as Goads in our Sides, for not utterly extinguiſhing them long ago.</p>
               <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> If we are to allow them, only becauſe we
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0454100800:202"/>
cannot Suppreſs them, then it ought to be try'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can or no; and I am of Opinion 'tis eaſie to be done, and cou'd preſcribe Ways and Means, if it were proper, but I doubt not the Government will find effectual Methods for the rooting the Contagion from the Face of this Land.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Argument they uſe, which is this, That 'tis a Time of War, and we have need to Unite againſt the common Enemy.</p>
               <p>WE anſwer, This common Enemy had been no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, if they had not made him ſo; he was quiet, in peace, and no way diſturb'd, or encroach'd upon us, and we know no reaſon we had to quarrel with him.</p>
               <p>But further, We make no queſtion but we are able to deal with this common Enemy without their help; but why muſt we unite with them, becauſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy? Will they go over to the Enemy, if we do not prevent it by a Union with them?—We are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well contented they ſhou'd, and make no queſtion we ſhall be ready to deal with them and the common Enemy too, and better without them than with them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if we have a common Enemy, there is the more need to be ſecure againſt our private Enemies; if there is one common Enemy, we have the leſs need to have an Enemy in our Bowels.</p>
               <p>'Twas a great Argument ſome People uſed againſt Suppreſſing the Old Money, that 'twas a Time of War, and 'twas too great a Riſque for the Nation to run, if we ſhou'd not maſter it, we ſhou'd be undone: and yet the Sequel prov'd the Hazard was not ſo great, but it might be maſter'd, and the Succeſs was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The Suppreſſing the Diſſenters is not a harder Work, nor a Work of leſs Neceſſity to the Publick: we can never enjoy a ſettled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, Faction, and Schiſm is melted down like the Old-Money.</p>
               <p>

To talk of the Difficulty, is to Frighten our ſelves with Chimaeras and Notions of a Powerful Party, which are indeed a Party without Power; Difficulties often appear greater at a diſtance, than when they are ſearch'd into with Judgment, and diſtinguiſh'd from the Vapours and Shadows that attend them.</p>
               <p>We are not to be frightned with it; this Age is wiſer than that, by all our own Experience, <hi>and theirs too;</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, had early ſuppreſt this Party, if he had took more deliberate Meaſures. In ſhort, 'tis not worth arguing, to talk of their Arms, their <hi>Monmouths,</hi> and <hi>Shafts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Here are ſome popular Objections in the way.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> THE Queen has promis'd them, to continue them in their Tolerated Liberty; and has told us She will be a Religious Obſerver of Her Word.</p>
               <p>WHAT Her Majeſty will do we cannot help, but what, as the Head of the Church, She ought to do, is another Caſe: Her Majeſty has promiſed to Protect and Defend the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and if She cannot effectually do that without the Deſtruction of the Diſſenters, She muſt of courſe diſpence with one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to comply with another. But to anſwer <hi>this Cavil more effectually:</hi> Her Majeſty did never promiſe to Maintain the Toleration, to the Deſtruction of the Church; but it is upon ſuppoſition that it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0454100800:204"/>
with the well being and ſafety of the Church ch which She had declar'd She would take eſpecial Care of: Now if theſe two Intereſts claſh, 'tis plain Her Majeſties Intentions are to Upholds, Protect, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and Eſtabliſh the Church, and this we conceive is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may be ſaid, THAT the Church is in no immediate danger from the Diſſenters, and therefore 'tis time enough: But this is a weak Anſwer.</p>
               <p>For firſt, IF a Danger be real, the Diſtance of it is no Argument againſt, but rather a Spur to quicken us to prevention, leſt it be too late hereafter.</p>
               <p>And 2dly, Here is the Opportunity, and the only one perhaps that ever the Church had to ſecure her ſelf, and deſtroy her Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentatives of the Nation have now an Opportunity, the Time is come which all good Men ha' wiſh'd for, that the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> may ſerve the Church of <hi>England;</hi> now they are protected and encouraged by a Church of <hi>England</hi> Queen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What will ye do for your Siſter in the Day that She ſhall be ſpoken for?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ever you will eſtabliſh the beſt Chriſtian Church in the World.</p>
               <p>If ever you will ſuppreſs the Spirit of Enthuſioſm.</p>
               <p>If ever you will free the Nation from the viperous Brood that have ſo long ſuck'd the Blood of their Mother.</p>
               <p>If ever you will leave your Poſterity free from Faction and Rebellion, this is the time.</p>
               <p>This is the time to pull up this Heretical Weed of Sedition, that has ſo long diſturb'd the Peace of our Church, and poiſoned the good Corn.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, 'TIS Cruelty to kill a Snake or a Toad in cold Blood, but the Poyſon of their Nature makes it a Charity to our Neighbours, to deſtroy thoſe Creatures, not for any perſonal Injury receiv'd, but for prevention; not for the Evil they have done, but the Evil they may do.</p>

               <p>'Twou'd be more rational for us, if we muſt ſpare this Generation, to ſummon our own to a general Maſſacre, and as we have brought them into the World Free, ſend them out ſo, and not betray them to Deſtruction by our ſupine Negligence, and then cry <hi>it is Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Merciful Meek Man, and yet with what Fury did he run thro' the Camp, and cut the Camp, and cut the Throats of Three and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his dear <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that were fallen into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; what was the reaſon? 'Twas Mercy to the reſt, to make theſe Examples, to prevent the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>How many Millions of future Souls we ſave from Infection and Deluſion, if the preſent Race of poiſon'd Spirits were purg'd from the Face of the Land.</p>
               <p>'TIS vain to trifle in this matter, the light fooliſh handling of them by Mulcts, Fines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their Advantage, if the Gallows inſtead of the Counter, and the Gallies inſtead of the Fines, were the Reward of going to a Conventicle, to preach or hear, there wou'd not be ſo many Sufferers, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Martyrdom is over; they that will go to Church
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0454100800:207"/>
to be choſen Sheriffs and Mayors, would go to forty Churches rather than be Hang'd.</p>
               <p>If one ſevere Law were made, and punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, that who ever was found at a Conventicle, ſhou'd be Baniſh'd the Nation, and the Preacher be Hang'd, we ſhou'd ſoon ſee an end of the Tale, they wou'd all come to Church; and one Age wou'd make us all One again.</p>
               <p>TO talk of 5<hi>s.</hi> a Month for not coming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and 1<hi>s. per</hi> Week for not coming to Church this is ſuch a way of converting People as never was known, this is ſelling them a Liberty to tranſgreſs for ſo much Money: If it be not a Crime, why don't we give them full Licence? And if it be, no Price ought to compound for the committing it, for that is ſelling a Liberty to People to ſin againſt God and the Government.</p>
               <p>If it be a Crime of the higheſt Conſequence both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the Good of the Church, and the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul, let us rank it among capital Offences, and let it receive a Puniſhment in proportion to it.</p>
               <p>We Hang Men for Trifles, and Baniſh them for things not worth naming, but an Offence againſt God and the Church, againſt the Welfare of the World, and the Dignity of Religion, ſhall be bought off for 5<hi>s.</hi> this is ſuch a ſhame to a Chriſtian Government, that 'tis with regret I tranſmit it to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>IF Men ſin againſt God, affront his Ordinances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt his Church, and diſobey the Precepts of their Superiors, let them ſuffer as ſuch capital <hi>Crimes</hi> deſerve, ſo will Religion flouriſh, and this divided Nation be once again united.</p>
               <p>And yet the Title of Barbarous and Cruel will ſoon be taken off from this Law too. I am not ſuppoſing that all the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> ſhou'd be Hang'd or Baniſh'd, but as in caſes of Rebellions and Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

if a few of the Ring-leaders ſuffer, the Multitude are diſmiſt, ſo a few obſtinate People being made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, there's no doubt but the Severity of the Law would find a ſtop in the Compliance of the Multitude.</p>
               <p>To make the reaſonableneſs of this matter out of queſtion, and more unanſwerably plain, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine for what it is that this Nation is divided into Parties and Factions, and let us ſee how they can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Separation, or we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can juſtifie our bearing the Inſults and Inconveniencies of the Party.</p>
               <p>ONE of their leading Paſtors, and a Man of as much Learning as moſt among them in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>An Enquiry into the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Conformity,</hi> hath theſe Words, P. 27. <hi>Do the Religion of the Church and the Meeting-bouſes make two Religions? Wherein do they differ? The Subſtance of the ſame Religion is common to them both; and the Modes and Accidents are the things in which only they differ</hi> P. 28. <hi>Thirty nine Articles are given us for the ſummary of our Religion, Thirty ſix contain the Subſtance of it, wherein we agree; Three the additional Appendices, about which we have ſome differences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if as by their own acknowledgment, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Church, and the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them is only in a few Modes and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, why ſhould we expect that they will ſuffer Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, corporeal Puniſhment and Baniſhment for theſe Trifles; There is no queſtion but they will be wiſer, even their own Principles won't bear them out in it, they will certainly comply with the Laws, and with Reaſon, and tho' at the firſt, Severity may ſeem hard, the next Age will feel nothing of it, the Contagion will be rooted out, the Diſeaſe being cur'd, there will be no need of the Operation, but if they ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to tranſgreſs, and fall into the Pit, all the World muſt condemn their Obſtinacy, as being without ground from their own Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0454100800:209"/>
Thus the Pretence of Cruelty will be taken off, and the Party actually ſuppreſt, and the Diſquiets they have ſo often brought upon the Nation, prevented.</p>
               <p>THEIR Numbers, and their Wealth, makes them Haughty, and that 'tis ſo far from being an Argument to perſwade us to forbear them, that 'tis a Warning to us, without any more delay, to reconcile them to the Unity of the Church, or remove them from us.</p>
               <p>AT preſent, Heaven be prais'd, they are not ſo Formidable as they have been, and 'tis our own fault if ever we ſuffer them to be ſo; Providence, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſeems to join in this particular, that now the Deſtroyers of the Nations Peace may be overturn'd, and to this end the preſent Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſeems to be put into our Hands.</p>
               <p>To this end Her preſent Majeſty ſeems reſerv'd to enjoy the Crown, that the Eccleſiaſtick as well as Civil Rights of the Nation may be reſtor'd by her Hand.</p>
               <p>To this end the Face of Affairs have receiv'd ſuch a Turn in the proceſs of a few Months, as never has been before; the leading Men of the Nation, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal cry of the People, the unanimous Requeſt of the Clergy, agree in this, that the Deliverance of our Church is at Hand.</p>
               <p>For this end has Providence given us ſuch a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch a Convocation, ſuch a Gentry, and ſuch a Queen as we never had before.</p>
               <p>AND what may be the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of a Neglect of ſuch Opportunities? The Succeſſion of the <hi>Crown</hi> has but a dark Proſpect, another <hi>Dutch</hi> Turn may make the Hopes of it ridiculous, and the Practice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: Be the Houſe of our future Princes never ſo well inclin'd, they will be Foreigners; and many Years will be ſpent in ſuiting the Genius of Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to this <hi>Crown,</hi> and the Intereſts of the Nation; and how many Ages it may be before the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

Throne be fill'd with ſo much Zeal and <hi>Candour,</hi> ſo much Tenderneſs, and hearty Affection to the Church, as we ſee it now cover'd with, who can imagine.</p>
               <p>'Tis high time then for the Friends of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to think of Building up, and Eſtabliſhing her, in ſuch a manner, that She may be no more Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Foreigners, nor Divided by Factions, Schiſms, and Error.</p>
               <p>IF this cou'd be done by gentle and eaſie Methods, I ſhou'd be glad, but the Wound is corroded, the Vitals begin to mortifie, and nothing but Amputation of Members can compleat the Cure; all the ways of Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, all perſwaſive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made uſe of in vain.</p>
               <p>THE Humour of the Diſſenters has ſo encreas'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, that they hold the Church in Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the Houſe of God is an Abomination among them: Nay, they have brought up their Poſterity in ſuch prepoſſeſt Averſions to our Holy Religion, that the ignorant Mob think we are all Idolaters, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of <hi>Baal;</hi> and account it a Sin to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of our Churches.</p>
               <p>The primitive Chriſtians were not more ſhie of a Heathen-Temple, or of Meat offer'd to Idols, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> of Swine's Fleſh, than ſome of our Diſſenters are of the Church, and the Divine Service ſolemnized therein.</p>
               <p>THIS Obſtinacy muſt be rooted out with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, while the Generation are left at liberty daily to affront God Almighty, and diſhonour his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worſhip, we are wanting in our Duty to God, and our Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How can we anſwer it to God, to the Church, and to our Poſterity, to leave them entangled with Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, Error, and Obſtinacy, in the Bowels of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to leave them an Enemy in their Streets, that in time may involve them in the ſame Crimes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0454100800:211"/>
the utter Extirpation of Religion in the Nation.</p>
               <p>WHAT's the Difference betwixt this, and being ſubjected to the Power of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence we have reform'd? If one be an extream on one Hand, and one on another, 'tis equally Deſtructive to the Truth, to have Errors ſettled among us, let them be of what Nature they will.</p>
               <p>Both are Enemies of our Church, and of our Peace, and why ſhou'd it not be as Criminal to admit an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt as a Jeſuit? Why ſhou'd the <hi>Papiſt</hi> with his Seven Sacraments be worſe than the <hi>Quaker</hi> with no Sacraments at all? Why ſhould Religious-houſes be more intollerable than Meeting-houſes—<hi>Alas the Church of England?</hi> What with Popery on one Hand, and Schiſmaticks on the other; how has She been Crucified between two Thieves.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>let us Crucifie the Thieves.</hi> Let her Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be Eſtabliſh'd upon the Deſtruction of Her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: The Doors of Mercy being always open to the returning Part of the deluded People: Let the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate be rul'd with the Rod of Iron.</p>
               <p>Let all true Sons of ſo Holy and Oppreſſed a Mother, exaſperated by her Afflictions, harden their Hearts againſt thoſe who have Oppreſs'd Her.</p>
               <p>And may God Almighty put it into the Hearts of all the Friends of Truth, to lift up a Standard againſt Pride and Antichriſt, that the Poſterity of the Sons of Error may be rooted out from the Face of this Land for ever—.</p>

               <p>THE Author profeſſes he thought, when he wrote the Book, he ſhou'd never need to come to an Explication, and wonders to find there ſhould be any reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>If any Man take the Pains ſeriouſly to reflect upon the Contents, the Nature of the Thing, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Stile, it ſeems Impoſſible to imagine it ſhould paſs for any thing but an Irony.</p>
               <p>That it is free from any Seditious deſign, either of ſtirring up the Diſſenters to any Evil Practice by way of prevention; much leſs of animating others to their Deſtruction, will be plain, I think, to any Man that underſtands the preſent Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> and the Nature of our Government.</p>
               <p>But ſince Ignorance, or Prejudice has led moſt Men to a haſty Cenſure of the Book, and ſeveral poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are like to come under the Diſpleaſure of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for it, in Juſtice to thoſe who are in danger to ſuffer for it; in Humble ſubmiſſion to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Council, who may be offended at it; and in Courteſie to all miſtaken People, who it ſeems have not Penetrated into the real deſign: The Author preſents the World with the Native Genuine Meaning and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Paper, which he hopes may allay the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Government, or at leaſt ſatisfie the minds of ſuch as imagine a deſign to Enflame and Divide us.</p>
               <p>The Paper, without the leaſt retroſpect to, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the Publick Bills in Parliament, now depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; or any other Proceedings of either Houſe, or of the Government relating to the Diſſenters, whoſe

Occaſional Conformity the Author has conſtantly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, has its immediate Original from the Virulent Spirits of ſome Men who have thought fit to expreſs themſelves to the ſame Effect, in their Printed Books, <hi>tho' not in Words ſo plain, and at length,</hi> and by an <hi>Irony not Unuſual;</hi> ſtands as a fair anſwer to ſeveral Books Publiſhed <hi>in this Liberty of the Preſs;</hi> which, if they had been handed to the Government with the ſame temper as this has, wou'd no queſtion ha' found the ſame Treatment.</p>
               <p>The Sermon Preach'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the <hi>New Aſſociation,</hi> the <hi>Poetical Obſervator,</hi> with numberleſs others; have ſaid the ſame thing, in terms very little darker, and this Book ſtands fair to let thoſe Gentlemen know that what they deſign can no farther take with Mankind than as their real meaning ſtands diſguis'd by Artifice of words; but that when the Perſecution and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Diſſenters, the very thing they drive at,</hi> is put into plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the whole Nation will ſtart at the Notion, and Condemn the Author to be Hang'd for his Impudence.</p>
               <p>The Author humbly hopes he ſhall find no harder Treatment for plain <hi>Engliſh without Deſign,</hi> than thoſe Gentlemen for their Plain Deſign in Duller and Darker <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any Gentlemen who have Patience to peruſe the Author of the <hi>New Aſſociation,</hi> will find Gallows, Galleys, Perſecution and Deſtruction of the Diſſenters are directly pointed at, as fairly intended, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd as in this ſhorteſt way, as, <hi>had it been real,</hi> can be pretended; there is as much Virulence againſt a Union with <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt King <hi>WILLIAM</hi>'s Government, and againſt the Line of <hi>Hannover</hi> there is as much Noiſe and Pains taken in Mr. <hi>S—s</hi> Sermon to blacken the Diſſenters, and thereby to qualifie them for the Abhorrence of all Mankind, as is poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0454100800:214"/>
The meaning then of this Paper is in ſhort to tell theſe Gentlemen,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That 'tis Nonſence to go round about, and tell us of the Crimes of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> to prepare the World to believe they are not fit to Live in a Humane Society, that they are Enemies to the Government, and Law, to the QUEEN, and the Publick Peace, and the like; <hi>the ſhorteſt way,</hi> and the ſooneſt, wou'd be to tell us plainly that they wou'd have them all hang'd, Baniſh'd and Deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But withal to acquaint thoſe Gentlemen who fancy the time is come to bring it to paſs, that they are miſtaken, for that when the thing they mean, is put into plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the whole Nation replies with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Captain, <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhou'd do theſe things?</hi> The Gentlemen are miſtaken in every partlcular, it will not go down, the QUEEN, the Council, the Parliament are all Offended, to have it ſo much as ſuggeſted, that ſuch a thing was poſſible to come into their Minds; and not a Man, but a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mercer,</hi> not far from the Corner of <hi>Fanchurch-ſtreet,</hi> has been found to approve it.</p>
               <p>Thus a poor Author has ventur'd to have all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind call him Villain and Traytor to his Country and Friends, for making other Peoples thoughts ſpeak in his Words.</p>
               <p>From this Declaration of his real deſign, he humbly hopes the Lords of Her Majeſties Council, or the Houſe of Parliament, will be no longer offended, and that the poor People in trouble on this Account ſhall be Pardoned or Excuſed.</p>
               <p>He alſo deſires that all men who have taken Offence at the Book, miſtaking the Authors deſign; will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to think again, and withhold their Cenſure till they find themſelves qualified to make a Venture like this for the good of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>

                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0454100800:215"/>
As to Expreſſions which ſeem to reflect upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Nations; he declares them to be only <hi>the Cant of the Nonjuring Party Expos'd,</hi> and thinks it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to let the World know that 'tis their uſual Language with which they Treat the <hi>Late KING,</hi> the <hi>Scotch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and the <hi>Line of Hannover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis hard, after all, that this ſhould not be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all the Town, that not one man can ſee it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churchman or Diſſenter.</p>
               <p>That not the Diſſenters themſelves can ſee that this was the only way to ſatisfy them, that whatever the Parliament might think fit to do to reſtrain Occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Communion, Perſecution and Deſtruction was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their intention, and that therefore they ha' no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to be quiet and eaſie.</p>
               <p>For any thing in the manner of the Paper which may offend either the Government, Parliament, or private Perſons, the Author humbly begs their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and <hi>proteſting the Honeſty of his intention,</hi> reſolves, if the poor People now in Trouble may be excuſed, to throw himſelf upon the Favour of the Government rather than others ſhall be ruin'd for his miſtakes.</p>

               <p>Ay, but Sir, we begin to doubt that is not the true Author, that he has been only made the Tool of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0454100800:217"/>
ſome other Party, who now they find the World Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated at it, have ſlipt out of the Nooſe, and left him it; we begin to be afraid the thing is a Reality, and there is ſuch a deſign on foot.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Your Anſwer, like Parſon <hi>Jacobs</hi> Text, ought to be taken a pieces and Explain'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1, If you are not ſure he is the Author, you <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> have done him a great deal of wrong, for you have rail'd at him more than all the reſt of the World, and charg'd him with more Crimes than 'tis well poſſible for one Man to be Guilty of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet by ſuppoſing him not to be the Author, yon ſuppoſe him to be very Honeſt to his Friends, that he bears all this without diſcovering them</p>

               <p>Pray why are you Diſſenters Angry at the Book call'd, <hi>The Shorteſt Way;</hi> 'Tis a little Myſterious, Sir,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0454100800:218"/>
that tho the <hi>Church Men</hi> are Affronted, becauſe 'twas Written againſt them, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are Affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe 'tis Wrote againſt them too, I don't well underſtand it, one ſort muſt be Fools, that's certain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>I don't care whether I underſtand it or no, he is a <hi>Rogue,</hi> a <hi>Villain,</hi> and I wiſh the Government had him, if I knew where he was, I'd deliver him up, and <hi>abate them the</hi> 501.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Spoken like a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> truly, ſo that I find you are Angry at him, becauſe you don't underſtand him and the Government becauſe they do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>You are ſo ſharp upon me, I do underſtand a little too, I underſtand he meddl'd with that he had nothing to do with, and he is a Man they ſay who has been the occaſion of all this Perſecution which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, by railing at <hi>Occaſional Conformity.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>If he expos'd you for <hi>Occaſional Conformity,</hi> 'tis what you ought to have Rectify'd your ſelves, that you need not have been expos'd for it; and in that he was your Friend, for had you took the hint, and exploded the Practice, there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>But what had he to do with that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, what had Mr. <hi>How</hi> to do to meddle with it afterward, I'll aſſure you his Name is down in my Pocket-Book, and when any Man in <hi>England</hi> defends a Cauſe worſe, I'll put his name out, and put t'others Name in: But pray Sir, why do you call this bringing Perſecution upon you; do you ſuppoſe the <hi>Occaſional</hi> Bill will be a Perſecution?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt it will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>What ſort of Perſecution can you call it? it can't be a Perſecution for Conſcience ſake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſo Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Why pray Sir, ſuppoſe one of your Brethren <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who can go to the <hi>Meeting</hi> to Day, and to the <hi>Church</hi> to Morrow; take the Sacrament to Day
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0454100800:219"/>
fitting, and to Morrow to get a good place, go to <hi>Church</hi> and take it kneeling; wipe his Mouth and go home to Dinner, and ſo to Meeting again; ſuppoſe this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſhould be put up for <hi>Sherriff,</hi> or <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> can this Man pretend Conſcience not to Conform? I tell you Sir, Mr. <hi>How</hi> muſt make a better Anſwer to the matter before I can be convinc'd, you may call it Perſecution but it can never be for Conſcience ſake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>Perſecution is Perſecution, let it be for what ſake it will, every man ought to be at liberty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Ay that is true, I am for Liberty for every man to ſerve God as is moſt agreeable to his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: But this is not ſerving God at all: beſides Sir, I could eaſily make it appear, this Act is for your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if you were a ſort of People to be convinc'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, how Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Why Sir, it will purge you of all your half in half Profeſſors. That's one thing; then it will put all thoſe Gentlemen into a capacity of being in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Parliaments, who tho' by this Act they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from you, and rejoin'd to the Church becauſe they can conform, will ſtill be friends to your Intereſt in all Publick Concerns; and therefore had I been to word the Bill ſo as to have done moſt harm, it ſhou'd have excluded all that ever were Diſſenters, and have forc'd you to continue ſo, and not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted your return to the Church without a public Repentance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, you may perſwade us 'tis for our advantage, but we don't like it, and therefore we hate him for medling with it; for what had he to do with it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>About as much as you and I have to do with him, if a man meddles with what does not concern him, that's his Fault, and if we who really have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him, meddle with him, that is our Fault, let the Government alone with him, have you nothing elſe to talk no?</p>

               <p>Yes, and reckon'd up all his Faults, all the ſins that ever he committed in his Life, and abundance more; be the man who he will, and what he will, I don't ſee but the beſt of us would be loth all the Faults we have ſhould be reckon'd up and writ in our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, as his are.</p>

               <p>You force a man to be an Advocate for One he has no kindneſs for; a wicked wretch you ſay; why has he been a Thief, a Murderer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>No no, I don't mean that way.</p>

               <p>Has he been a Whoremaſter or a Drunkard, or a Swearer?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>No, I can't ſay ſo neither, but he broke and can't pay his Debts.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If you had ſaid he had broke and won't pay his Debts, you had ſaid more to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But I muſt do one piece of Juſtice to the man, tho' I love him no better than you do, that is this: That meeting a Gentleman in a <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> where I and every body elſe was railing at him, the Gentleman took us up with this ſhort Speech.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, ſaid, he, I know this D' <hi>Foe</hi> as well as any of you, and I was one of his Creditors, and I Compounded with him, and diſcharg'd him fully; and ſeveral Years afterward he ſent for me, and tho' he was clearly diſcharg'd he paid me all the Remainder of his Debt Voluntarily, and of his own accord: And he told me, that as faſt as God ſhould enable him, he Intended to do ſo with every Body; when he had done, he deſired me to ſet my Hand to a Paper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, which I readily did, and found a great many Names to the Paper, before me, and I think my

            <sp>

               <p>Now pray, after ſo much patience as I have had with you, have a little with me; and if I can, I'le ſet you right in your Thoughts of theſe things.</p>
               <p>There are a ſort of People among the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> who can either Diſſent or Conform, as they find their Inclinations or Intereſt rather directs them, theſe by their Wealth and Intereſt have always put themſelves into good places, and qualifi'd themſelves for that purpoſe, by taking the Sacrament: Of theſe People, even the moſt moderate <hi>Church Men</hi> have an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and truly ſo have Two Thirds of your own Friends, for it looks as if they were Men of no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at all.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe Men the Act againſt <hi>Occaſional Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> is principally deſign'd, and if there was nothing elſe in the Bill, I believe no good Man would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe things, Two ſorts of People have been very groſly miſtaken, and upon their Miſtakes have proceeded to Act very Fooliſhly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The high Flying <hi>Church Party</hi> begun to think, all was a going their own way, and that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would fall in with them, and do your buſineſs for you, and away they run with the Notion, and Preach you down, and Print you down, and Talk you down like Mad Men; there is Sermon upon Sermon, Pamphlet upon Pamphlet: One ſays you are all Rogues and Hypocrites, another ſays you are Enemies to the Government, one Flies at the Toleration, and tells the World 'tis Deſtructive to the Nations Happineſs, and the Politicians muſt pull it down; another ſays 'tis Antichriſtian, and we cannot be true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if we don't pull it down; others like hare-brain'd Huntſmen that over run the Hounds roar you down with full Cry, till they run themſelves out of Breath; others are for having you depriv'd of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0454100800:233"/>
Voices in Elections of Parliaments, in hopes of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving to that Bleſſed Day, when they ſhall have a Parliament of their own Mind; and thus they Run before they are Sent, and without Reflecting upon their ill grounded Zeal, without examining any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, other than their Paſſions, without regard to good manners, taking no Notice of the Preamble of the Act of Parliament, which Declares againſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or the Honour and Sacred Promiſe of Her MAJESTY, given to make Her Subjects eaſie, they blow up the Fire of Perſecution and Deſtruction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Government will or no.</p>
               <p>You are the next ſort of People, who are miſtaken, for being Naturally a little Hypiſh, as the Beaus call it, troubled with the Spleen, and Hypocondriack Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, this Cloud of Raillery ſo darken'd your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that you preſently take theſe People and the QUEEN, theſe People and the Government, theſe People and the Parliament, to be all of a mind; and the QUEEN having diſplac't all your Friends, as 'tis but juſt, <hi>That all Princes ſhould employ who they pleaſe:</hi> And the Parliament falling on your <hi>Occaſional Conformers,</hi> and this Book of <hi>the Shorteſt way</hi> coming out altogether, the high Church Party Thundred at you from the Preſs and the Pulpit: Away you run with the Notion that you are all to be blown up, that all theſe Things aim'd at your Deſtruction, and that Fire and Faggot was at the Door.</p>
               <p>But the Government is ſteady, and the QUEEN ſtill has maintained her Motto, the Parliament ſteers in the middle way, going about to reſtrain, but not to deſtroy you; and taking no notice either of the heat of one party, or Folly of the other, they hold the Ballance of your Liberty between your exorbitant Licenſe, and the other party's unchriſtian Fury; and in my opinion, thus far are you ſafe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Diſ.</speaker>
               <p>But then why has not the Government thought
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0454100800:234"/>
fit to diſown the Zeal of theſe High-flyers, by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make Examples of ſome of them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Obſ.</speaker>
               <p>I told you, the Diſſenters were all for Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Examples, for the ſame reaſon that they have not puniſhed you for ſupecting the QUEEN's Honeſty to her word, charging the Parliament with going about to perſecute you, and the like; for this reaſon, becauſe they are more merciful than both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deſerve.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the general abhorrence Mankind ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Book, you might learn that the deſtruction of our Party is a Cruelty not to be found in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nature.</p>

               <p>They are angry, becauſe they take the Book as the Author meant it, and you, becauſe you take it as he wrote it, they as he meant, <hi>viz. to expoſe them,</hi> and tho' they are heartily willing to do you a Kindneſs that way, and have ſhewn their good Will by their words, yet knowing they wanted Power to Execute it, and being conſcious to themſelves that the Government was not of their Opinion; they are enrag'd to have all their deſigns laid open in Minature, and an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment communicated to the World in <hi>true Billingſgate.</hi>

                  <hi>The Act of Settlement (ſays he) and the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>are</hi> the two Bucketts, <hi>keep one but up and the other muſt be down, and put the one down, and the other comes up of Courſe: There can be no pretence made to alter or diſpoſe the Settlement, but the bringing in the Prince of</hi> Wales; <hi>therefore whoever they are that mention it, we ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they wou'd be ſo underſtood.</hi>

               <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ROPE</hi> has now for nine Years paſt been afflicted with a Bloody, a Cruel, and a Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive War, carried on with a vaſt Effuſion of Blood and Treaſure; and in all Parts of it manag'd with more Eagerneſs and Fury, than any War among
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0454100800:240"/>
the <hi>European</hi> Princes ever was in the Memory of Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who are Maſters of Addreſs, uſed all the Skill and Cunning with the Roman Catholick <hi>Princes,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> to have made it paſs for a <hi>War of Religion,</hi> thinking by that fineneſs to have drawn them off from the Confederacy. But <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. who, 'twas likely, knew as much of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Intereſt of the Church, as the Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>France,</hi> ſaw through that Artifice, and readily agreed with the Emperour, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> That the Growing Greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures laid for the Subjecting <hi>Europe</hi> to her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were really more dangerous things, and of more immediate Conſequence to the Publick Liberty, than the Matter of Religion could be: And therefore, tho' the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made ſome ſeeming Difficulties at firſt; yet the <hi>French</hi> having thrown off the Mask, and fallen upon his Catholick Confederate the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the moſt Bigotted Romaniſt made no ſcruple to entertain the Heretick Soldiers, to recall the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh'd <hi>Vaudois,</hi> to fight under the Command of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Generals, to accept of the Subſidial Supplies of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Money, and the protection of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Armies; thereby evidently declaring to the World, that this was a War of State, not of Religion; and that the real Intereſt of <hi>Princes,</hi> is to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Subjects, againſt a too powerful <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader,</hi> by Leagues and Aſſiſtances, let their Religious Intereſts be what they will.</p>
            <p>Nor have the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> tho' their Forces in this Confederacy have been much Superior, been back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to puſh on the Common Intereſt with their utmoſt Vigour, but have with extraordinary chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs aſſiſted the Roman Catholick Confederates with their Armies, Fleets, and Moneys; witneſs the Subſidies paid to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0454100800:241"/>
and <hi>Dutch;</hi> the Army maintain'd, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Duke <hi>Schombergh</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> pay in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the Forces Ship'd from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> to aid the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which ſav'd the City of <hi>Barcelona</hi> a whole Year; Witneſs alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet Wintering at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> under Admiral <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> the Squadron ſent to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to Relieve <hi>Carthagena:</hi> And indeed the whole Series of the War has been one continual Inſtance of the Safety and Protection the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Countries have enjoy'd by the Sword and Power of the Proteſtant Intereſt.</p>
            <p>So that it has been apparent beyond the power of Contradiction, that this has been a War of State, not a War of Religion: Nor can I imagine, generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it can ever be the Intereſt of the <hi>Powers</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> take them together, to Commence a War of Religion: For tho' 'tis true, That the <hi>Pope</hi> always Exalted both his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Credit,</hi> in the blind Ages of bigotted Devotion, by his Cruſadoes and Holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions; yet ſince, the World has more Years over its Head, and the Cheat has been diſcovered, <hi>Int'reſt</hi> has prevail'd too much upon Devotion to be deceiv'd any more at that rate: And the Reformed Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> are too potent to be us'd ſo any more.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion has loſt Ground in <hi>France;</hi> and that Kingdom where once the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> were Strong enough to Contend with their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for their Liberty, is now wholly <hi>Roman,</hi> at leaſt ſeems to be ſo. But notwithſtanding that, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> very well able to ſtand a ſhock with the Popiſh, when ever the Pope thinks fit to publiſh another <hi>Bloody Jubilee,</hi> and <hi>diſplay</hi> the Standard of St. <hi>Peter</hi> againſt St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And not to deſcend to particulars, I ſhall only Draw up the ſeveral Kingdoms, on each Side, who would form this Great Diviſion in Caſe of ſuch a War.</p>

               <hi>On the Roman Catholick Side,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There would be the Emperor, the Pope, the King of <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> Five Electoral Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Catholick Cantons of <hi>Swiſſerland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the Proteſtant Side,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Czar of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> States of <hi>Holland,</hi> Three Electoral Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> but thoſe by far the Strongeſt; the Proteſtant Cantons of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> the <hi>Griſons, Hungarians, Tranſilvanians,</hi> and <hi>Moldaviaens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I think it wou'd eaſily be granted, That the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, Dane,</hi> and <hi>Swede,</hi> United; wou'd be able to Maintain ſo abſolute a Dominion of the Seas, as would entirely Ruin the Negotiation of the Catholick Party, Beggar their Merchants, Starve their Iſlands, and Deſtroy all their Trade: They ſhould never be able to Build a Ship without Leave; their Ports ſhould be Bombarded and Deſtroy'd, their Open Country be Ruin'd by Deſcents, and all their Coaſts continually Harraſs'd and Alarm'd by Fleets, and Volant Parties.</p>
            <p>What the Armies at Land could do, I referr to the Hiſtory of the Preſent War, and of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> who, barely on a War of Religion, and with only his Own ſingle Force, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who were then much Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker than they are now, in Two Years and a half paſs'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Danube,</hi> and ſhook the Imperial Crown on the Head of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>It would take up too much room in this ſhort Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, to Conſider the Proportion of the Force of theſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0454100800:243"/>
Nations in general; 'tis true that the weight of the Force of the Catholick Party, lies in the Power of the <hi>French;</hi> who muſt, in ſuch a Caſe, be the Bulwark and Support of their Cauſe.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he wou'd as he has in all Caſes have Work enough to <hi>Secure his Own;</hi> the Empires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Proteſtant Party, with the <hi>Swede, Dane, Brandenburghers, Saxons,</hi> and all the Prince of the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion on its Front, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> in the Rear, with the <hi>Switz</hi> and <hi>Griſons</hi> in the Flank, wou'd be very hard beſtead, having no Power but the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> and the ſmall Electorates of <hi>Ments, Triers</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> which are of no Conſideration to uphold it. Some Support might be drawn from <hi>Italy</hi> indeed; but the <hi>French</hi> muſt give a powerful Aſſiſtance, or the Emperor would be Devoured in two Campaigns, the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern Germans,</hi> as the <hi>Lunenburghers</hi> of <hi>Hannover</hi> and <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> would be the Oppoſites to the <hi>French</hi> on this ſide, and there the Contention would be ſtrongeſt.</p>
            <p>I believe no Wiſe Man wiſhes for ſo Univerſal a Diſtraction as ſuch a War would make in <hi>Europe,</hi> but 'tis needful to ſuppoſe ſuch a Thing, in order to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether we ought to apprehend any Danger from it, in caſe ſuch an Attempt ſhou'd ever be made in <hi>Europe;</hi> for 'tis apparent, ſome Princes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Party, have Will enough to ſuch an Enterprize, and the Pope would be forward enough to ſet it on Foot, if he were but ſure of the Succeſs.</p>
            <p>The glorious Peace of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> in which all the World muſt acknowledge the <hi>French</hi> have been very much reduc'd, has but One Clauſe that any way Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Honour of its Concluſion on the Proteſtant ſide, and that is, that it left the Poor Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the King of <hi>France,</hi> without any ſhelter from the Violences of their Perſecutors; as if the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0454100800:244"/>
Proteſtant Princes had ſo much excluded the Int'reſts of Religion from the Articles, that they had not one Compaſſionate Thought for their Diſtreſſed perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Brethren. 'Tis true, the War was wholly <hi>a War of State,</hi> as is before noted, and the Invaſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was the Occaſion of it; and therefore the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who is a Roman Catholick, nay, a few Villages in the <hi>Chattelany</hi> of <hi>Aeth,</hi> made more Buſtle in the Treaty, than the Reſtoration of Three Hundred Thouſand baniſh'd Chriſtians to their Country and Eſtates.</p>
            <p>Some have preſum'd to ſay, That had the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> been inſiſted on with the ſame Vigour as the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> it wou'd as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been obtain'd; and theſe People, among whom ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Refugees are of that Mind, think the Proteſtant Int'reſt was not ſo much Conſidered in that Treaty as it ought to have been. I cou'd eaſily Anſwer ſuch Objectors, by telling them, That the Ground of this War being only Matter of Right, to reduce the Power of <hi>France</hi> to a Balance, and to oblige her to reſtore what ſhe had by Force and Injuſtice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her Neighbours; this being obtain'd, the End was anſwer'd, and the Confederate Princes had no farther Pretence for a War: As to the Proteſtant Refugees, they were the Subjects of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſtrictly ſpeaking with reſpect of Princes, no body had any thing to do with it, let him uſe them how he would.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to have made it an Article of the Peace, it could not be expected that the Catholick Branches of the Confederacy would have inſiſted on it, or, indeed, have deſired it, and the Treaty being Manag'd in one Body, by the Reſolutions and Meaſures of ſeveral Princes and States in Congreſs, the Catholick Princes would have immediately proteſted againſt it, and the Union muſt have been Diſſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0454100800:245"/>
So that there was no room to Eſpouſe the Intereſts of the Proteſtant Subjects of <hi>France</hi> in the General Treaty, any other Way than by Interceſſion with their King to uſe them Mercifully: And this has been done by all Parties, tho' hitherto without Succeſs.</p>
            <p>It remains now to examine what Methods are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be uſed, in order to oblige the King of <hi>France</hi> to uſe his Proteſtant Subjects with more Humanity, and if poſſible, either to preſerve them that Peace and Enjoyment of their Properties and Eſtates, which is their Natural Right; or to procure them ſome other Equivalent which may give them ſome kind of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Repoſe.</p>
            <p>To Commence a War againſt the King of <hi>France,</hi> for the Proſecution of His Proteſtant Subjects, ſeems to be very Unjuſt; becauſe Speaking of Right and Wrong, we are not Intereſted in the Quarrel. I make no Queſtion but the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> themſelves have, by the Laws of Nature and Reaſon, a right to Defend their own Poſſeſſions and Inheritances, and to Maintain themſelves in them by Force, if they had a Power; and by the ſame Rule might by Strength of Hand recover and take Poſſeſſion of their own Rights, be they never ſo Juſt. Only thus far 'tis plain, That by the particular Article of the Peace of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France; England</hi> is fore-cloſed from ſuch an Attempt, both Sides having expreſly Stipulated not to Aſſiſt the Subjects of either againſt their Soveraign. The Fourth Article of the ſaid Treaty, ptoviding as follows, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſince the moſt Chriſtian King was never more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of any thing, than that the Peace be Firm and Inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ſaid King Promiſes and Agrees for Himſelf and His Succeſſors, That he will on no Account whatſoever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the ſaid King of</hi> Great Britain <hi>in the free Poſſeſſion of the Kingdoms, Countries, Lands or Dominions which He now Enjoys, and therefore Engages His Honour, upon</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0454100800:246"/>
               <hi>the Faith, and Word of a King, that He will not give or Afford any Aſſiſtance, directly or indirectly, to any Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or Enemies of the ſaid King of</hi> Great Britain; <hi>and that He will in no manner whatſoever favour the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies or Plots which any Rebels, or ill-diſpoſed Perſons, may in any Place Excite or Contrive againſt the ſaid King; and for that End Promiſes and Engages, That He will not Aſſiſt with Arms, Ammunition, Proviſions, Ships, or Money, or in any other way, by Sea or Land, any Perſon or Perſons, who ſhall hereafter, under any Pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, Diſturb or Moleſt the ſaid King of</hi> Great Britain <hi>in the free and full Poſſeſſion of His Kingdoms, Countries, Lands and Dominions. The King of</hi> Great Britain <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Promiſes and Engages for Himſelf and Succeſſors, Kings of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>That He will Inviolably Do and Perform the ſame towards the ſaid moſt Chriſtian King, His Kingdoms, Countries, Lands and Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There ſeems to be but one way left, either to make any amends to theſe poor deſolate People, or to bring to paſs their Re-admiſſion; I do not ſay, that the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> will find it their Intereſt to put it in practice any more than I believe it is really the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'reſt of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to Ruine ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Families of his Peaceable Subjects; I mean, <hi>the Old Standard Law of Retaliation.</hi> But if it might be a Means to re-eſtabliſh thoſe poor People in Peace and Liberty, the Sacrificing Ten Thouſand Families of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, as Innocent as them, ſeems to be a Juſtice their preſent Caſe calls for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> ſeems to me to be the Foundation-Law of Right and Wrong; the Scripture is full of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Nature: <hi>Adoni-bezek, Agag,</hi> declare it to be agreeable to the Divine Method of Executive Juſtice; the reaſon of Rewards and Puniſhments, ſeems to be wholly meaſured by it; and if exactly adminiſtred, it carries ſo convictive a Force, that no Perſon who ever fell under the ſevereſt part of it, could object againſt
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0454100800:247"/>
the Execution of it. <hi>Adoni-bezek,</hi> above-mentioned, made a Confeſſion of the Juſtice of his Puniſhment, when his Thumbs and great Toes were cut off, as a Retaliation of his Barbarities. <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 7. And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> Return upon <hi>Agag,</hi> That <hi>as his Sword had made Women Childleſs, ſo ſhould his Mother be Childleſs among Women;</hi> declares both the Reaſon and the Juſtice of Gods Decree againſt him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 33.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, this Retaliation is ſtrictly Perſonal; and all Retaliation ought to be ſo, if poſſible: But in ſome Caſes it differs; and where a Perſonal Retaliation is not practicable, then People are conſidered in Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Bodies, Nations, Families, and States. Thus, in a War, the Subjects of either Party account is very ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable, to make themſelves ſatisfaction for Injuries received, on any of the Subjects of the contrary Party, tho' the Wrong particularly ſuffered, is not chargeable on thoſe particular Perſons who ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>By the ſame Rule, it ſeems juſtifiable, if we caſt the whole Body of <hi>Europe</hi> into Two ſorts, <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> that while the one part commit Hoſtilities and Depredations on the other, the injur'd Party ſhould have a Right of Retaliation on any Member of the ſame Body, of what Nation or Government ſoever they ſhall be, where the Power is properly put into their Hands: for Power, in ſuch a caſe, may paſs for a ſufficient Right of Directing the ſaid puniſhment, ſince nothing but want of <hi>Power</hi> interrupts its being <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King has given a Challenge to all the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> in his preſent Uſage of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France:</hi> He has carry'd on, tho' not with much Succeſs, a War for above Eight Years, againſt the whole United power of <hi>Europe;</hi> at laſt he has made a <hi>Peace,</hi> not at all to his Advantage, nor much for his Honour: And now the War of State is at an end, he ſeems to be beginning a War of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0454100800:248"/>
and that he may lay the Foundation of it ſafely, he has began it upon his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine why all the <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould not think themſelves concern'd in this Invaſion of their Religion, ſince nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that they are all ſtrook at, tho' more remote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: And by all the Rules of Human Policy, prevention ought to extend as far as the Evil is deſign'd.</p>
            <p>If the weakening the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in general, were only the Deſign; the ſtrengthening that Intereſt ought to be the care of the other: Beſides, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are the Aggreſſors, as they always have been, and the Injuſtice of their Cauſe ſo great, that they have hardly ever attempted to make any other pretences for all their Barbarities, than the Abſolute <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of their <hi>Omnipotent Monarch,</hi> who <hi>will have but one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion within his Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs, to me it ſeems very proper, for the Eaſe of all <hi>Parties,</hi> That Religion ſhould really divide the whole Body of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that all the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> if they could but agree it among themſelves, ſhould live by themſelves: That if the <hi>French</hi> King will have no <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould ſuffer no Roman Catholicks in theirs; and when all <hi>Parties</hi> are withdrawn to their own ſort, and the Diviſion compleated, let the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks begin a War of Religion as ſoon as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>It is, in my Opinion, the unjuſteſt thing in the World, that ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> ſuffer no <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to live amongſt them, but the Bloody <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> deſtroys them, and the <hi>French</hi> have Dragoon'd Three Hundred Thouſand of their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects to <hi>Maſs,</hi> and hurry'd Three Hundred Thouſand more out of their Country, to ſeek Comfort from the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Neighbour States. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has Exil'd all his <hi>Proteſtant Vaudois:</hi> And hardly any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0454100800:249"/>
Country admit the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> among them, ſome few parts of <hi>Germany</hi> excepted, yet the Proteſtant-Governments, at the ſame time, ſuffer Three Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Papiſts to live among them, and enjoy their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Eſtates unmoleſted.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all, the Proteſtants of <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> have been perſecuted, under the Aſſurances of the moſt ſolemn Treaties, the moſt ſacred Edicts, and the firmeſt Peace that could be made; they have never (their Enemies themſelves being Judges) been guilty of the Breach of their Faith or Loyalty. <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> acknowledged it, when he had recourſe to them for Protection againſt his own mutinous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Subjects. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> acknowledged it, in his Speech to thoſe <hi>Vaudois</hi> whom he had Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of the Citadel of <hi>Turin.</hi> We never read of any War begun by the Proteſtants, they were always Defendants: We have not one Inſtance of a Maſſacre committed, or a King Aſſaſſinated, or of Nobles Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined, in order to be blown up by them; they have always been Men of Peace, till Self-Defence has oblig'd them to be Men of War. On the contrary, the Roman-Catholicks have been always uneaſie to the Governments they have lived under. Our Hiſtories are full of their Treaſons. <hi>Ireland</hi> has twice been Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Blood by their Rebellions and Cruelties. Two Kings of <hi>France</hi> have been Murthered by their Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and innumerable Proteſtants Maſſacred and Butcher'd in cold Blood, under the pretences of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and aſſurance of a Treaty.</p>
            <p>The Reigns of all our Kings and Queens in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſince <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. have been ſtrangely diſturb'd by the Plots, the Treaſons and Rebellions of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; they have often forfeited their Eſtates and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties to the Publick Juſtice of the Nation, had they been dealt with by the Rules of ſtrict Retaliation.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0454100800:250"/>
               <hi>England Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have ſuch Reaſons for Entire removing them out of their Dominions, as no Nation in the World can have greater; and yet here they live in Peace, under the protection of thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Princes they refuſe to ſwear Allegiance to, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhelter of thoſe Laws they refuſe to be bound by. 'Tis no Plea in Bar of any Right, that the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> is a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> our Courts of Juſtice are as open to them, as to any of the Kings moſt faithful Subjects: Of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> tho charg'd with no Diſloyalty, nor guilty of no Crimes are Diſpoſſeſs'd of their Eſtates, Baniſh'd their Native Country, Dragoon'd, Shipt to the Gallies, and many of them Hang'd, their Children torn from them by Violence, and buried alive in Monaſteries and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, and all the Cruelties an unbridled Soldiery can inflict, acted upon them, without any manner of Crime alledg'd but their Religion, and this when that very Religion was ſecur'd to them by the ſolemneſt Leagues and Treaties in the World, Declared in the famous Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> Entred, Receiv'd and Regiſtred in all the Parliaments of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> in perſecuting his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, acts not only the part of a Tyrant over them, as they are his Subjects, but is guilty of the Breach of the Faith and Honour of a King, oppreſſing thoſe <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> who had their Religion tolerated and allow'd to them by his Anceſtors, in the moſt ſacred manner poſſible; and he is alſo guilty of the greateſt Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thoſe very <hi>People</hi> who were the Inſtruments and Agents of the Glory of his Family, and of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>To make good which Reflection, that I may not ſeem to be guilty of Diſreſpect to the Majeſty of the King of <hi>France,</hi> 'tis needful to examine a little the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0454100800:251"/>
Ground on which the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt in <hi>France</hi> ſtood for the laſt Century of Years, and the Hiſtory of the preſent Royal Family of <hi>France,</hi> and how they came to the Crown.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1571. on the 24th. Day of <hi>Auguſt, Charles</hi> IX. being King of <hi>France,</hi> the Third War with the <hi>Hugonots</hi> having been lately ended, and a Peace made with the Proteſtants, the Cities of <hi>Rochel, Montauban, Coignac,</hi> and <hi>la Charitie,</hi> being put into their Hands for Security, and the Chief of the Proteſtants wholly reſting on the Faith and Honour of the King, in full Satisfaction of his ſincere Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being come to Court, was acted the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris;</hi> at which, in the ſpace of Five Days, above Thirty Thouſand Proteſtants were barbarouſly Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and Butcher'd in Cold Blood.</p>
            <p>Upon which follow'd the Fourth and Fifth Civil War; during which, King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. died; and the Crown fell to <hi>Henry</hi> III. the laſt of the Houſe of <hi>Valois,</hi> and then newly Elected King of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Beginning of his Reign being entangled with Civil Broils, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt grew very ſtrong; and tho' the League forced the King to make Three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Wars with them, yet they ſtill maintain'd their Liberty and Religion.</p>
            <p>At length the Faction of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> known by the Name of the <hi>Catholick League,</hi> Declar'd themſelves ſo abſolutely againſt the King, and grew ſo powerful, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after the Death of the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> whom the King had cauſed to be kill'd, that they had almoſt driven him out of the Kingdom. In this Exigence, the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> againſt whom they had carry'd on Four Perſecutions and Wars, and therein deſtroyed many thouſands of their Brethren, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took his Defence, and joining all their Forces, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Reſtore him, marched with him to the very Gates of <hi>Paris;</hi> where, while he was preparing for a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0454100800:252"/>
general Attack of the City, he was barbarouſly Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated by <hi>Jacques Clement,</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Monk, ſent out of the City on purpoſe, being ſtabb'd in the Belly with a Poynard, of which he died the Day after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the preſent King's Grand-father, was then King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> and being Lawful Heir to the Crown, as alſo recommended to the Nobility by the deceaſed King, at his death, took upon him the Stile and Title of <hi>King of France.</hi> The <hi>League,</hi> back'd by the Power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him with all the vigour imaginable; and many of the Catholick Nobility deſerted him, on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his being an Heretick.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſerv'd him with all the Glory and Loyalty that ever was ſhown, perhaps, in any War in the World; and, as is computed, during the Years War he maintain'd againſt the <hi>League,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power, above an Hundred and Sixty Thouſand Proteſtant Soldiers loſt their Lives in his Service. At length, to put an end to the War, and aſſure himſelf of the Kingdom, he deſerted his Religion, and turn'd Roman-Catholick; by which means he obtain'd a full Poſſeſſion of the Crown, ruin'd the League, the Chief Heads of it making their Peace with him, one by one; and at laſt concluded the War with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> at the Peace of <hi>Vervin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> however, never withdrew their Loyalty nor their Services from him: The famous Mareſchal <hi>de Biron,</hi> the Dukes <hi>de Bouillon, du Pleſſis,</hi> and <hi>de la Tremouille,</hi> continuing to do him the moſt faithful and important Services againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the laſt.</p>
            <p>Having ſettled himſelf in the Kingdom, and made peace with all the World, the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who had ſerv'd him ſo faithfully, and who expected no other Reward than the Security of their Religion and Eſtates, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from him the famous Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> in which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0454100800:253"/>
is particularly ſtated and ſtipulated, the Terms of their Liberty, in what places they ſhould erect their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, how they ſhould hold their Synods and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: Money was allotted out of the publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, to maintain their Miniſters; Cities were allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, for their Security, the Garriſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were to be paid by the King: And the Edict was made perpetual and Irrevocable, by being Entred and Regiſtred in the <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and Courts of Juſtice all over the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But all the Services of the Proteſtants to this Great King, by which he was brought to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> nor the ſolemn Engagement of this Edict, could not preſerve them, but that in the Miniſtry of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> under the very next Reign, they were again attack'd, and driven to the neceſſity of taking Arms in their own Defence: Which Cardinal, after three times making Peace, and breaking it again at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, compleated the Conqueſt of them, in the Taking of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> the Proteſtants being miſerably deſerted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Thirteen Thouſand People Starv'd to Death in the Town.</p>
            <p>Since this, in the Infancy of the preſent King, while the Conteſts between the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Queen-Mother were ſo hot as to break out into a War, the Proteſtants, as Subjects only, were not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to the maintaining him in that very Power, which now he makes uſe of to their Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I think this Hiſtory fully makes good the Aſſertion that the preſent Uſage of the Proteſtants is both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious and Ungrateful. Perfidious, as being acted while under the Protection of a Sacred League and Solemn Treaty, and Ungrateful as it is exerciſed on thoſe very People, who with their Lives and Eſtates, raiſed the preſent Fortune of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> to the Greatneſs it now enjoys.</p>
            <p>I have been the more particular in this Account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0454100800:254"/>
from hence it will appear that the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> ſtand on a different foot from other Subjects of that Monarchy, and that his right of Dealing with them, differs from his Power over the reſt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for they are his Subjects by expreſs Stipulations and Agreements, whoſe Obedience to him has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways allow'd to be Conditional; they have made Peace and War with their Kings, not as Rebels, but as Perſons having a Lawful Right to Plead and to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, their Kings have given them Cautionary Towns for the Performance of the Treaties made with them; a Thing which in its own Nature implies that they might hold thoſe Towns againſt him, if he did not perform the Poſtulata of thoſe Treaties, without the Scandal of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>So that their Right to the Liberty of their Religion, had an Authority ſufficient to juſtifie them in taking Arms; nor does any of the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtories, that ever I ſaw, tho' wrote with the greateſt Partiality, ever call it a Rebellion, but a War with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and the Concluſions were always call'd, <hi>A Peace with the</hi> Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots, as is Evident thro' <hi>D' Avila</hi>'s whole Hiſtory of the Civil Wars of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the Proteſtants of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Hungary</hi> and of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> might in many reſpects bear a parallel with this, the Perſecutions and ill-Uſage of them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been after the ſolemneſt Agreement and Treaties with them that could be made; inſomuch as that poor Unhappy People being ſo abſolutely ſeparated from any Relief of their Brethren of <hi>Germany,</hi> have been forced to fly for Protection to the Enemies of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, the <hi>Turk,</hi> with whom however they have this Satisfaction, that whatever Bargain they make for their Religion, they are ſure they will keep it. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member very well a Baniſhed <hi>Hungarian</hi> Miniſter told me, Diſcourſing of this very Caſe, <hi>he was ſorry to ſay it, That the Turks, tho' they made them pay Dear for it,</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0454100800:255"/>
               <hi>were Juſter and Truer to their Leagues and Treaties than the Imperialiſts, who call'd themſelves Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may poſſibly be objected here, That while we Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> for their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their Subjects, if we ſhould do the ſame thing to the Papiſts, it would be Practiſing what we Condemn and doing Evil that Good may come.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to this is included in what goes before, <hi>viz.</hi> taking the whole Roman Catholick and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Party in <hi>Europe</hi> aſunder, and conſidering them as two Collective Bodies divided in Intereſt and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it ſeems to me to be juſt that a Retaliation of the Injuries done upon the Members of one Party in one place, may be made upon the Members of the ſame Party in another place, by the ſame Rule that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of the Subjects of one Prince in War, may be paid by Reprizal upon sny of the Subjects of the ſame Prince.</p>
            <p>But this may be more fully anſwer'd thus, That if the Popiſh Subjects of ſome Proteſtant Governments have ſo behaved themſelves to their Governors, as to make their Extirpation juſt, that Juſtice however ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in Mercy to them hitherto, will abſolutely ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie removing them from thoſe Governments, and by that means <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> be Executed by the Hands of Publick Juſtice, and one Baniſhment be at the ſame time both a Puniſhment of their ſeveral Crimes, and a Retaliation of the Oppreſſions of their Party. This is a Method God Almighty often takes himſelf, while he ſuffers a Puniſhment for a publick Crime of leſs Guilt to be the Executor of his Vengeance for ſome Crime of a higher Nature not known.</p>
            <p>To go no farther than <hi>Ireland</hi> for an Inſtance of this, the preſent Inhabitants, I mean the Popiſh <hi>Iriſh</hi> by a Bloody Maſſacre of Two Hundred Thouſand <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in 1641. by little leſs intended, and as much as they were able, executed this late War, have deſerved no doubt to have been uſed at the Diſcretion of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0454100800:256"/>
               <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> was more than once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting to Tranſplant the whole Nation from that Iſland. If he had done it, or if it had now been done, I am of the Opinion, no Nation in the World wou'd have Tax'd us with Injuſtice, and I do verily think <hi>Oliver</hi> Acted with more Generoſity than Diſcretion in omitting it; for this is certain, that if he had done it, this laſt War and the Expence of ſo much Treaſure as it coſt this Nation, and the Ruine of ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Families, who were driven from thence by King <hi>James,</hi> all the Deſtruction at <hi>London-Derry,</hi> the Sickneſs at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and the Blood of 150000 people, who at leaſt one way or other, on both ſides, periſh'd in it, had been prevented.</p>
            <p>It may be enquired whithere <hi>Oliver</hi> deſign'd to Tranſplant them, I could anſwer directly to that alſo; but 'tis ſufficient to my purpoſe to ſay, had he clear'd the Iſland of them, it had been no matter at all to us whither they had gone, and the King of <hi>France</hi> has ſet a Rule for ſuch as Baniſh their Subjects to let them go where they pleaſe, and then they certainly ſeparate; whereas had he ſent the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to any particular place, they wou'd have been ſo many and ſo United, they might poſſibly have come back again with Swords in their Hands, and ha' bidden fair for another <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> War,</p>
            <p>I have alſo ſeen among the Letters of State written by Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> who was his Secretary for the Foreign Diſpatches, a Letter written to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> wherein by way of Argument to prevail for ſome Eaſe to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he propoſes a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and all their Reform'd Friends, to reduce the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to a Neceſſity of giving better Conditions to the <hi>Vaudois;</hi> and ſeems to Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Expel all the Roman Catholicks in <hi>Engiand, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> out of his Dominions. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon Diſcourſing of this paſſage in ſome Company
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0454100800:257"/>
one asked, <hi>What if he had?</hi> and another by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee, made Anſwer, <hi>Then there wou'd have been none left.</hi> I repeat it not for any great Wit in the Anſwer but to Introduce the Queſtion,</p>
            <p>What if he had?</p>
            <p n="1">1. If he had, poſſibly we had not been troubled with any <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> in 1678. nor none of the Bloody Conſequences of it; we had had no <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> upon that, no <hi>Ruſſel, Sidney,</hi> nor <hi>Armſtrong</hi> Murthered; no Blood loſt in an Invaſion by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> nor Cruel Executions in the Weſt; we had had no <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Succeſſor, no Standing Army, no Biſhops ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> no Invaſion of Charters nor Priviledge of Univerſities; no Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We had had no Nuncio from <hi>Rome,</hi> to take his Progreſs over the Kingdom, no Fire-Works for a Sham-Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> nor no Maſs Sung in <hi>Windſor</hi> Chappel, no Seminaries or Prieſts, nor Nunneries of Whores, at <hi>Chelſea, Lincoln-Inn Fields,</hi> or <hi>Hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In ſhort, we had had no War of Nine Years to reſtore a Popiſh King, the Nation had not ſpent 60 Millions Sterling, nor loſt 200000 of the Stouteſt of her Inhabitants to Maintain her Liberty; King <hi>William</hi> had been King in Right of his Wife, and a Peaceable Admiſſion had been given him.</p>
            <p>In all probability this had been the Conſequence, if <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> had ſent them all out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>I beſhrew his Heart he did not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not pretend to lead my Reader to any Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reaſons why this ſhou'd be done now; our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are beſt Judges of the publick Intereſt. But thus far, I think, may be aſſumed without danger of Religion.</p>
            <p>If the Nation ſhou'd think fit in Compaſſion to the Miſeries of our poor Diſtreſſed Brethren of <hi>France</hi> to Retaliate their Uſage upon the Roman Catholicks of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0454100800:258"/>
               <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the following Conſequences would in all probability enſue, which whether it wou'd be juſt in the whole, or Beneficial to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> in particular, I leave to the Judgment of Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It might be a means, by the Interceſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to procure ſome reaſonable Conditions for the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as the Stopping the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>Boufflers</hi> at the Surrender of <hi>Namure</hi> procur'd Juſtice to the Impriſoned Garriſons of <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mude.</hi> This is a Practice too well known in the War to need any Contention, where the putting a Priſoner of War to Death, or any other Breach of Articles has been requited buy putting ſome other Priſoner of War to Death on the contrary Side; and tho' the latter be an innocent Perſon, <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> is the Word, the Juſtice of it is not diſputed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It wou'd put theſe Kingdoms in a Condition to Entertain and Relieve that great Multitude of Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſtians, with the very Subſtance of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and the King of <hi>France</hi> might, if he pleas'd, make the Roman Catholicks Amends, by giving them the Eſtates of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> or what other Way he thought fit.</p>
            <p>This is moſt certain, that the Roman Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> wou'd not have half the Reaſon to Complain of hard Uſage that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have, they have no Leagues or Capitulations to ſhow for their Permiſſion; the Laws of the Kingdom are expreſly againſt them, and they have in all Reigns for 150 Years paſt, been the Diſturbers of the Peace of it; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe now to Swear Allegiance to the Government, and if they do not Diſturb it, it is Owing to their want of Power, not their want of Will.</p>
            <p>But if they had all thoſe Defences to make, which have been hinted, on behalf of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> they wou'd have no body to thank for ſuch Uſage, but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0454100800:259"/>
their own Friends. And the Pope, if he ow'd them ſo much Care, might uſe his Intereſt with the King of <hi>France,</hi> to let the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> enjoy their Liberty, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſave them from the ſame Fate.</p>
            <p>Some, indeed, object againſt the receiving ſuch vaſt Numbers of Foreigners among us, as Prejudicial to the Intereſt of Trade, and to our own Manufacturers and Inhabitants, by Eating the Bread out of our Months, and Starving our own Poor.</p>
            <p>This is an Argument would require a little Volume to Anſwer; but in General, I preſume to Affirm, That no Number of Foreigners can be Prejudicial to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> let it be never ſo great. Number of Inhabitants, is the Wealth and Strength of a Kingdom; and if we had a Million of People in <hi>England,</hi> more than we have, let them be of what Nation they would, it would be far from being a Damage to us.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, if theſe Million of People were all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans, Manufacturers, it would be ſome detriment to our Poor who are employ'd in thoſe particular Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures: But allow one third to be Artiſans, one third Labourers, Husbandmen or Sailors, and one third Merchants, Shop-keepers or Gentlemen; and if the greateſt Number that can be ſuppoſed came to ſettle in <hi>England,</hi> it could be no Injury, but a vaſt Advantage to the Kingdom in general: And it will appear by this One particular, well examin'd.</p>
            <p>An Addition of a Million of People, ſuppoſe that were the Number, would devour a proportion'd quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Corn and Fleſh for Food and Drink, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned quantity of Manufactures for Cloth and Houſholdſtuff; the one employs more Land, and the other more People? Now 'tis apparent, we have in <hi>England</hi> more Land lies unimprov'd, common, and waſte, than would feed a vaſt many People more than we have; and we have a Staple of Wooll, never to be exhauſted. In Manufactures, the more Lands we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0454100800:260"/>
the greater the Rents will be, and the greater the general Stock of the Nation will be; and the more Manufactures are made, the better the Poor are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and the Richer the Manufacturer is made.</p>
            <p>Many other Arguments might be uſed, to prove, That the coming Over of Foreigners can be no general prejudice to the Nation, as to Trade. But that is not the main thing here. If the Roman Catholick Princes purſue their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects with ſuch Cruelty, and drive them into Baniſhment and Exile, to ſeek Relief in Foreign Countries the Caſe ſeems to ſpeak for it ſelf, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can have no readier way, either to prevent the Miſerics of thoſe poor perſecuted People, or to relieve them in their Exile, than by dealing with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their Dominions in the ſame manner, and Inviting the ſaid perſecuted <hi>French</hi> to come and live in the Eſtates and in the Places of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This is <hi>Lex Talionis:</hi> And this is a way that would ſoon tire the <hi>Papiſts</hi> out. For I think I may be allowed to ſuppoſe there are much the greater number of <hi>Papiſts</hi> among the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> than there are of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the Exile of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would alſo diſter, as to Place. For, generally ſpeaking, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Countries are the beſt for Strangers to live in, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> People are the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding People of the World; therefore the Exile of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> would be leſs to their diſadvantage, than the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who muſt apply themſelves to Countries where there are few Manufactures, ſmall Trade, and but very indifferent Means for a Stranger to Live. So that the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Exiles would be in much the worſe Circumſtances: And there is no queſtion, but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall find it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe this Remedy, the Roman-Catholick Powers will find it for their Intereſt to make ſome Cartel, or Condition, upon which all their Subjects, tho' they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0454100800:261"/>
are <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> may enjoy ſome ſort of Liberty in their own Native Countries; and ſo Perſecution, as well as War, might end in an an Univerſal Happy Peace to <hi>Europe,</hi> both in Matters of Religion, as well as Civil Affairs, which has ſo often been attempted by other Methods, to ſo little purpoſe.</p>

            <head>A LETTER to Mr. <hi>HOW,</hi> By Way of REPLY TO HIS CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PREFACE TO AN Enquiry into the Occaſional Conformity of DISSENTERS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFTER ſuch an Account as you have given of your ſelf in the Five firſt Pages of your Book, with the Averſion you have to any thing which ſhou'd interrupt you in your more <hi>Recluſe</hi> Studies; I preſume no Man cou'd imagin you would break tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough your own Meaſures to attack a <hi>poor Prefacer,</hi> as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0454100800:262"/>
you call me, and wholly quitting the Argument, amuſe the World, and content your ſelf to Laſh the Author with the Severity of your Wit.</p>
            <p>Herein, Sir, I muſt own, that not only your Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but all the Town ſeem Diſappointed exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Mr. <hi>How,</hi> who thinks the Subject not worth Anſwering, ſhou'd trouble his Head, or ſpend his Time about the Impertinence of a <hi>ſorry Prefacer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I Addreſs'd the Preface to you, I thought I had ſo carefully Revis'd both it and the Book, that, as I mention'd to you, I cou'd no-where be Tax'd with Exceeding the Rules of Charity and Good Manners.</p>
            <p>And tho' I wou'd always make them both my Rule, yet I thought my ſelf oblig'd to it more now than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, by how much the perſon to whom, and the perſons of whom I wrote, were equally known and very much valued by me; and I did not queſtion but I ſhou'd either not be Reply'd to at all, or it wou'd be done with the Charity of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the Civility of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and the Force and Vigour of a <hi>Scholar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince it ſeems good to you, Sir, to deſcend ſo far below your ſelf as to quit the Diſpute offer'd, and fall upon me perſonally, and to mix Raillery and Reproach with your Argument, <hi>which, I am ſure, you know too well to think betters the Cauſe:</hi> You muſt blame your ſelf, Sir, for Obliging me in my own Defence to be a little freer with you than otherwiſe I ſhou'd have thought had become me.</p>
            <p>Nor, Sir, ſhou'd I have engag'd with you, even in my own Defence, knowing I am to ſtruggle with ſo unequal a Match both as to your Learning and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, had I not ſeen your Book differ ſo much from your conſtant Character; and pardon me, Sir, for the Word, <hi>in many Places from the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince I am oblig'd thus publickly to Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon my Superiors, for ſuch I own you to be both in Learning and Office,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0454100800:263"/>
I ſhall ask your Leave to lay down ſeveral Miſtakes upon which I muſt be allow'd to ſuppoſe you have gone in the Cenſures which you have made; which Suppoſitions I draw from the whole Tenour of your Writing.</p>
            <p>I preſume, Sir, that you are miſtaken in theſe Four Points, in the <hi>Perſon, Temper, Profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> of the Author,</p>
            <p>Which Miſtakes, I ſhall venture to ſuppoſe, are the Reaſons which moved you to treat your Adverſary with ſo much indecent Contempt.</p>
            <p>As to my <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Temper:</hi> 'Tis true, Sir, I have choſen to conceal my Name; and tho' bating Humane Frailty, Sins and Misfortunes, I know no Reaſon why the Argument ſhould be aſham'd of the Author, or the Author of the Argument: Yet when I conſider'd how conſtant a practice it is in the World to Anſwer an Argument with Recriminations inſtead of Reaſonings, I thought it beſt to continue retir'd, that the Caſe I had enter'd upon might not come clogg'd with the dead Weight of the Meanneſs and Imperfections of the Author.</p>
            <p>I need not go back to the Inſtance of our Saviour, whoſe Arguments were Confronted with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that Queſtion, <hi>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?</hi> For I find that even Mr. <hi>How</hi> himſelf wou'd have ſearch'd my Character to have compleated his Remarks with Perſonal Reflections.</p>
            <p>And yet I cannot imagine what Relation my Name has to the Argument; it cou'd be only uſeful to furniſh you with ſomething in my Character to Reproach me with; which, <hi>God knows you might have found enough of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what wou'd all this be to the Point in hand? The Occaſional Conformity of Diſſenters is not Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors on either ſide, but by Truth, Scripture, and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou was't altogether born in Sin,</hi> ſays the High-Prieſt,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0454100800:264"/>
and the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to the Poor Man whom Chriſt had healed; <hi>and doeſt thou Teach us?</hi> And yet the poor Man was in the Right; and if I am ſo, tho' I was the meaneſt and moſt ſcandalous of Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, is my Argument the worſe?</p>
            <p>But, Sir, to Anſwer all thoſe Particulars, and let you know that I am not altogether ſo ſhy of my Name as you imagine, I ſhall give you a Genuine honeſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my ſelf, and then my Name is at your Service.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sir, I am to tell you, that I am, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelf to be, poſſeſs'd with a ſtrong Averſion to Doubling and Shifting in Points of Religion; and do think that the Caſe in hand is be allow'd no leſs: And therefore wrote the Enquiry with Two very honeſt Deſigns, <hi>viz,</hi> To ſee if by Strength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I cou'd receive Satisfaction; and to Explode, and, as far as in me lies, to Oppoſe the Practice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Had your Book given me, or any Body elſe that I can meet with, <hi>whoſe Judgment is to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the Satisfaction I deſir'd; I aſſure you, I am ſo little fond of an Opinion, becauſe it is mine, that I ſhou'd not have been aſham'd to have own'd my ſelf miſtaken; and poſſibly have ſhown as much Humility in Acknowledging it, as you think I have Pride in Oppoſing.</p>
            <p>As to Perſonal Miſcarriages and Misfortunes, of which no Man has more, and which, perhaps may weaken the Reputation of the Author, but I am ſure ought not of my Argument: To them I ſhall only ſay, God <hi>in his Merciful Providence has heal'd the Laſt, and, I hope, has Pardon'd the Firſt:</hi> And if ſo, I am upon even Terms in point of Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>By this you may ſee I am ſenſible of the Beam in my own Eye, and have for ſome years taken up the part of a Penitent on that very account; but did never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that thereby I was barr'd from Enquiring into what I judg'd Scandalous to the Profeſſion of a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0454100800:265"/>
Party in General, of whom, <hi>though unworthy, I</hi> was a Member.</p>
            <p>Nor, Sir, am I any-where guilty of Judging another, where the Caſe is not ſo plain, as that it really ſeems to ſpeak it ſelf: For I muſt remember alſo, that we are no more to call Good, Evil, or Evil, Good, than we are to Judge one another.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I am gone over my own Character; and ſhall only demand this from you of Right, That, ſo far as Truth and Honeſty is on my ſide, it may not, nor ought not to be deſpis'd for being uſher'd in by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy inſtrument.</p>
            <p>And 'tis ſtrange, Sir, that you who Animadvert upon me for Judging, ſhould ſo ſeverely judge me, and that wrongfully too, as ſhall appear in the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this ſhort Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I cou'd not be ſatisfi'd to ſay leſs to this point on theſe Accounts, becauſe I muſt put in a <hi>Caveat</hi> againſt Perſonal Reflections as unfair in the Diſpute: He that pleaſes firſt to Confute the Argument, is welcome to ſhow his Wit in Satyrizing upon the Follies and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Author: And there I leave it, and proceed to what I conceive is your third Miſtake about me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi> My profeſſion. And this you ſeem to make plain, while from the 13th, to the 24th page, you treat me as an Independent, and ſpend your time to Reply to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rticular Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in diſpute between You and Them: which, with Submiſſion, I conceive to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>P</hi> 30, 31, 32, I am talk'd with as a <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</hi> and <hi>Leveller;</hi> what of theſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> any where appears in the Enquiry, I confeſs I am at a loſs to know; nor, Sir, have you been ſo kind to lay it down.</p>
            <p>Indeed I own my ſelf ſomewhat ſurpriz'd to ſee you run on in Anſwering the ſcrupulous Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0454100800:266"/>
about <hi>Kneeling at the Sacrament,</hi> and the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</hi> about ſeizing the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind for the Uſe of the Saints; and ſuch things as theſe, by way of Reply to an <hi>Enquiry about Occaſional promiſcuous Conformity:</hi> and am ſtill at a Loſs to find an Antecedent to this Relative.</p>
            <p>I aſſure you I am no <hi>Independent,</hi> nor <hi>Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-man,</hi> nor <hi>Leveller.</hi> You have ſhown your Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sir, and Confuted an Error inconſiſtent with Civil Society: Very well; but this had been better done by it ſelf; it had no more relation to the Caſe in hand, than a Lecture againſt the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> and you may as well conjecture me to be a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> as a <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</hi> from any thing in the Book that looks like either. But, Sir, ſince I am led by you to give an account of my profeſſion, which, I hope I ſhall always be ready to do; I ſhall do it in few words: That I am of the ſame Claſs, and in the ſame Denomination of a Diſſenter with your ſelf, your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice excepted, and am willing to be guided by, and to practice the Great Rule of Chriſtian Charity in all the proper and legal Extents of it: Indeed I have more need to practice it than you, becauſe I ſtand more in need of it from others, with reſpect to the Cauſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready nam'd. And however, by wreſting Words, and miſtaking my Intentions, you are pleaſed to ſee nothing of it; I am not yet convinc'd that I have broken that Great Chriſtian Rule of Charity, in any thing I have written.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Fourth Thing in which you are miſtaken, which is in my <hi>Intentions;</hi> in which you raſhly, and, I aſſure you, wrongfully judge me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cautious you wou'd have me be of judging others: But, Sir, <hi>Humanum eſt Errare;</hi> you are no more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, I ſee, than I, and are fallen into the ſame raſh Error you Reprove me for with ſo much Severity; by judging, that the principal Deſign of this Book
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0454100800:267"/>
was to reflect upon a Worthy Gentlemen, who is nam'd in the <hi>Preface:</hi> And in one place you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to join me with the Party who Oppos'd him, and bring me in making my Court to them.</p>
            <p>All theſe, Sir, I ſhall make appear to be not only Miſtakes, but groundleſs Miſtakes; ſuch as nothing but the ſame Thoughts which put you out of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, cou'd lead you into: And I can ſolemnly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal in the Form you have ſet down, that you have wrong'd me in your Cenſure.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sir, the <hi>Enquiry</hi> was publiſh'd Three years ago, and therefore cou'd not be deſign'd as a Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Invective againſt the Gentleman you ſpeak of: All that can be ſaid, is, That the Cauſe being again given, the Re-printing it was deſign'd as a Reproof to the Practice: and ſo much I own. As for <hi>Perſons</hi> I am indifferent; <hi>if the Coat fits any Body, let them wear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Sir, I declare my ſelf, if of any Party, I am, and ever was for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty, and for the putting ſuch Men into Magiſtracy, who, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the King, our Supream Magiſtrate, wou'd protect and preſerve that Liberty. And, as a Perſon every way qualified to execute a Truſt of ſo much Honour, whether profitable or not, I won't examine, I gave my Vote for Sir <hi>Thomas Abney,</hi> and ſhou'd ha' done ſo, If I had the power of Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Voices; and no Man has more Reſpect for, or Opinion of his Honeſty and Ability than my ſelf: Nor have I, God be thank'd, any Occaſion to ſay this to flatter him; <hi>for I neither want his Favour, nor fear his Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein therefore I preſume to ſay you have been entirely miſtaken; and theſe Errors have led you to waſte your Time, and the Reader's too, in making needleſs Remarks, and Anſwering thoſe People who never Oppos'd you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0454100800:268"/>
I come now to that part of your Book which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Caſe in hand; which, as it is the leaſt part, and indeed ſeems to agree with the Title, that it is only a <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the Preface; <hi>for really with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, there is very little Anſwer to the Fact:</hi> So it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not that I ſhou'd Reply to the Argument; for I ſee none, but that drawing back the Curtain which you have ſpread over the Subject, I ſhou'd ſet it in a True Light, that all Men may judge by their own Conſciences, and the Scripture-Rule, and take care they be not diſtinguiſh'd out of their Reaſon and Religion by the Cunning and Artifice of Words.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe therefore, Sir, to admit me to run over your Book with as modeſt Animadverſions as my juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will allow; and I am content to ſtand Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where I fail in point of Decency.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You quarrel with me for a <hi>Breach of Kindneſs and Equity, in hiding my own Name and Revealing yours. Deſigning my ſelf to fight in the Dark, and expecting you to do it in open Light.</hi> And you give us Five whole Pages, including the Quotation of your ſelf in your Preface to the Inhabitants of <hi>Torrington,</hi> to ſhow your indifferency in Controverted Diſputes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Unwillingneſs to engage in this.</p>
            <p>Truly, Sir, as to the Firſt, I thought a publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, who are a publick Perſon, had been no Sin apainſt Kindneſs or Equity; if it be, I ask your Pardon.</p>
            <p>As to my Concealing my Name, I have given you my Reaſons already; and as to my Expoſing yours, had you thought fit to have Replied to the Book which lay Three years unanſwer'd, without being addreſs'd to any perſon in particular, you had been at Liberty to have remain'd as unexpos'd as the Author.</p>
            <p>But the Enquiry being unanſwer'd, gave ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more prejudice againſt the Integrity of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in general, than I cou'd wiſh to have found; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0454100800:269"/>
which I thought it neceſſary to have the Matter diſcuſs'd, if poſſible; and knew no Man more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it, <hi>nor more capable than your ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is your Anſwering me ſuch a Diſappointment as you are pleas'd to mention; but that you ſhou'd attempt it, and do it to no more purpoſe, is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, more Diſappointment to me than any thing I cou'd ha' met with.</p>
            <p>Whether, Sir, the Indifferency you are ſo pleas'd with in your Temper, be Congruous to your Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as a <hi>Goſpel Miniſter, I</hi> ſhall not examine: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you that are Paſtor of a Diſſenting Church, and Adminiſter the Ordinances of Chriſt to a Select Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in a way Diſſenting from the Eſtabliſh'd Church, and thereby maintain a Schiſm in the ſaid Eſtabliſh'd Church, ought to be ſo indifferent as to boaſt that you never perſwaded any Man to Conform, or not to Conform, I leave it to your ſelf to conſider; I am ſure, if I was arriv'd to that Coldneſs in the matter my ſelf, I wou'd Conform immediately; for I think what I affirm'd in the <hi>Enquiry</hi> Page remains a Truth unanſwer'd by you: <hi>That Schiſm from a True Eſtabliſh'd Church of Chriſt, is a great Sin; and if I can Conform, I ought to Conform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Declaration of your own indifferency to meddle in Matters of Controverſie, with your Reaſons for it, which I ſuppoſe you wou'd have taken as Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory to what follows, you are pleas'd to proceed <hi>very angrily</hi> to examine why I engage you in this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: I have given you an Account of it already with all the Honeſty and Plainneſs I can, and I thought a Perſon in your Place wou'd never have Reſented the being put upon the Defence of his Profeſſion, or being Civilly ask'd a Queſtion about it; and I cannot but obſerve how carefully you avoid being engag'd in the preſent Diſpute.</p>
            <p>I ought to have been well aſſur'd, you ſay, (1.)
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0454100800:270"/>
               <hi>That you did adviſe one way or the other;</hi> Or, (2.) <hi>That you ought to have done ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Really, Sir, I think it immaterial whether you <hi>were,</hi> or on; or, whether you <hi>ought,</hi> or no; for I never Charg'd you with the firſt, or affirm'd the laſt; but only ask'd this fair Queſtion:</p>
            <p>Whether it was allow'd by Diſſenters in general, or by your Congregation in particular? To which Queſtion you give no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall anſwer you honeſtly and directly: I am aſſur'd, as far as Rationally I can be, by conſequences of things, <hi>that you have not adviſed one way or other?</hi> Nor do I affirm you ought to have done ſo, unleſs the Perſon concern'd, applied to you for Advice in Point of Conſcience on the Caſe; if he did, I do not ſee how you could decline it. So that to me, it ſeems, you either were oblig'd, or not oblig'd, as the Application of the Perſon concern'd might alter the Caſe: I do not ſay you were oblig'd officiouſly to tender your Advice in the Caſe: <hi>If I am wrong here, I ſhall acknowledge my Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror when I am better inform'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing will come cloſe to the Point, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a <hi>Fault,</hi> an <hi>unlawful Action,</hi> or no, for a Diſſenter, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to hold Occaſional Communion with the Eſtabliſh'd Church, and, at the ſame time continue in, or return to his Relative conjunction with a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Church?</p>
            <p>That it is not a ſinful Act ſimply to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Eſtabliſh'd Church, I willingly agree. But ſince on this Point depends the Weight of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſpute, I muſt conclude, That I think 'tis a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Act circumſtantially and conjunctively.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I wou'd be rightly underſtood, I ſhall endeavour to be Explicit, tho' I run the hazard of being counted impertinent.</p>
            <p>I have laid down the Caſe, I thought, fairly, and of which you are pleas'd to take no Notice, in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> Page 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0454100800:271"/>
               <hi>He who Diſſents from an Eſtabliſh'd Church from any other Reaſons but ſuch as theſe; That he really believes the ſaid Eſtabliſh'd Church is not of the pureſt Inſtitution, but that be can ſerve God in a Form more agreeable to his Will; and that accordingly 'tis his Duty to do it ſo, and no otherwiſe: Such a one ought to Conform, becauſe to make a Wilful Schiſm in the Church, is doubtleſs a great Sin, and if I can avoid it, I ought to avoid it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then I am guided by this real Principle of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Diſſent, how can I Conform without Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt that Conſcience, by which only my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting is made Lawful?</p>
            <p>And thus, Sir, I am brought to my Argument again: Of which I ſhall give you this ſhort Abſtract; and you or any body elſe, are welcome to be angry with me, if you will be pleas'd firſt to Anſwer it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he who Diſſents from the Eſtabliſh'd Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from a true Principle of Conſcience, is guilty of a great Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he who Conforms to the Eſtabliſh'd Church againſt his Conſcience, is guilty of a great Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he who both Diſſents and Conforms at the ſame time and in the ſame Point of Religion, muſt be guilty of one of theſe great Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he who has committed either of theſe Sins, ought not to be receiv'd again on either ſide on any other Terms than as a Penitent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not examine, as I hinted then, whether the Gentleman you would embroil me with, be thus guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>be that to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt now come to your Diſtinctions: Indeed Sir, I believe as you ſay, that taking which ſide you will, you may puzzle the moſt of plain people, who are but of ordinary Underſtandings in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy about Ceremonies: And give me leave to add, That ſuch is the Subtilty and Nicety of Sophiſtical Reaſonings, that Men may almoſt Diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0454100800:272"/>
into, and out of any Opinion; and ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are Maſters of the Art of Nice Arguing, too often loſe both Themſelves and their Religion in the Labyrinchs of Words: <hi>School Divinity and Practical Chriſtianity are Two things,</hi> and ſeldom underſtood by the ſame Heads.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, with the greateſt Reſpect, and ſome Concern, let me tell you, I did not think to find all the Difference between the Diſſenters and the Church of <hi>England</hi> dwindl'd into <hi>Three additional Appendices, in which we have ſome Difference, and ſo:</hi> and this from Mr. <hi>How,</hi> who is Paſtor of a Separate Church.</p>
            <p>If we differ from them in Trifles, or have but a Trifling Difference, I think we can never juſtify ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo large a Chaſm in the Church; we have much to anſwer for, without queſtion, in the too fatal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of this Nation, if it has all been occaſion'd by a few ſmall Appendices.</p>
            <p>If our Differences are not Matters of Conſcience I have no more to ſay; if they are, 'tis a Myſtery yet hidden from the Common Underſtandings, how they can be firſt inſiſted on from a Principle of Conſcience, and then wav'd without acting againſt that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which only could juſtify the firſt inſiſting on them: If you can Diſtinguiſh us into this, I am miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>I allow your Diſtinctions of Sins, which are Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent or Inconſiſtent with the Chriſtian State to be Orthodox and Right.</p>
            <p>I allow your Diſtinctions of Negative and Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts, and, according to my weak Talent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with you in them.</p>
            <p>But the Conſequence you draw, with ſubmiſſion, does not reach the Caſe; which is, That ſcrupulous Perſons ought to be fully perſwaded in their own Minds; and Fellow-Chriſtians were not to Judge, but to Receive them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0454100800:273"/>
This you have anſwer'd your ſelf, <hi>P.</hi> 13. to be meant in dubious and ſmall Matters: And if we muſt ſtick here, we are next to Examine, Whether the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Us and the Eſtabliſh'd Church be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in dubious and ſmall Matters; if it be, I know not how we ſhall Ward off the Below of being guilty of Schiſm; the Sin of which I ſuppoſe you will not diſpute. Wherefore to deſcend to ſome Particulars—If I know why we Diſſent from the Eſtabliſh'd Church, 'tis principally on ſuch Accounts as theſe.<list>
                  <item>1. On account of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Clarkſon</hi>'s No Scripture-Evidence for Dioceſan Biſhops.</note>Hierarchy, Prelatical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and Super-intendency.</item>
                  <item>2. On account of their impoſing things own'd to be indifferent, as Terms of Communion.</item>
                  <item>3. On account of their impoſing things own'd to be otherwiſe indifferent, as made neceſſary by the Command of the Civil Magiſtrate.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to Partial Conformity, Diſſent in ſome things, and Conforming in others, which you mention <hi>Page.</hi> 
               <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF"/>. it does not ſeem to concern this Caſe. No Man among the Diſſenters, I believe, pretended to Diſſent in every thing; but we are ſpeaking of Conforming in thoſe very Points in which we Diſſent, and that no leſs than the <hi>Article of Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe are your ſmall things, I am content to ſtand by it, and ready to prove, as I ſaid in the <hi>Enquiry:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That whoever Separates from this Church, and at the ſame time Conforms to it; by Conforming, denies his Diſſent being Lawful; or, by his Diſſenting, Damns his Conforming as Sinful.</p>
            <p>All this, Sir, you have not thought fit to touch upon, for Reaſons which you know beſt; and I really won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you ſhou'd take ſo much pains to Cavil at me and a ſimple Preface, which really was not worth your while; and when you have led your ſelf into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, take no notice of the thing it ſelf, as it is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0454100800:274"/>
but Diſtinguiſh ſo nicely about the ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and omit the greater.</p>
            <p>If we differ from the Eſtabliſh'd Church in ſmall things only, we are to blame to make the Breach ſo wide. Was it for ſmall and dubious Things only that we ſuffer'd Proceſs of the Law, Excommunications, Seizures of our Eſtates, and Impriſonment of our Perſons? And ſince you are pleas'd to bring in that Honourable Gentleman, ſpeaking in the firſt Perſon to the Point, as an Inference drawn from your Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and your ſelf telling us what he may perhaps do;</p>
            <p>Give me leave to go through thoſe Suppoſititions Caſes with you, Sir. <hi>As to the particular Perſon, you concern him in it, not I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>He may have Arguments ſo ſpecious, that ſuppoſing he Err, may Impoſe upon the Judgment, and thereby Direct the Practice of a very Intelligent, Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright-hearted Man, ſo as to make him think that which is perhaps an Error, his preſent Duty, and ſo not offer Violence to his Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer: Admit he does ſo; yet while you at the ſame time allow <hi>he Errs,</hi> that is, Sins; why ought not he to be admoniſhed to Repent of that Sin, before he be receiv'd again into Communion? This is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent: You grant (<hi>P.</hi> 9.) a Man is to do the part of a Penitent for a Fault; and this Error is a Fault, though it were an Error of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then you ſay, <hi>P.</hi> 18. <hi>As judging ſuch a Church true as to Eſſentials, he may think (Occaſion inviting) he hath greater Reaſon, though it be Defective in Accidents, to Communicate with it ſometimes, than to ſhun its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion always.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pardon me, Sir, I muſt ſay this ſeems a Sophiſm in Religion; for allow he may think ſo, you muſt allow he ought not to think ſo. And why <hi>Occaſion inviting?</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0454100800:275"/>
Why not <hi>Occaſion compelling?</hi> 'Tis manifeſt, For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> cou'd not <hi>compel,</hi> why ſhou'd <hi>Occaſion invite?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confine not my Argument to this Gentleman; but of Others I can prove, That Force cou'd not <hi>compel</hi> them, but Occaſion, that is, Honour and Preferment cou'd <hi>invite</hi> them. Now if you pleaſe to Reconcile this for me, I ſhall be gotten over one Point; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man can juſtify ſuffering to the Ruin, perhaps of his Family, rather than comply with that which he may do without impoſing upon his Conſcience, and which, Occaſion inviting, he may judge lawful?</p>
            <p>You have another Diſtinction which, I confeſs, hardly think to be Rational, that is, Unprofitable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, <hi>Page.</hi> Firſt, I neither underſtand that the Inſtance you are upon is Unprofitable, nor believe it; nor that the Epithite can be proper to the word, for that which is unprofitable, cannot be a Preferment.</p>
            <p>I muſt alſo obſerve here, Sir, that the Conformity exacted in the late Reigns, was not ſo large as what theſe Gentlemen are pleas'd to comply with volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. Now as to the Ceremonies you inſiſt on, and which indeed I do not, as the way of Adminiſtration Kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was allow'd to be ſo indifferent than, that many receiv'd in the Church Standing. But when theſe <hi>Unprofitable Preferments,</hi> as you pleaſe to call them, invite, they ſeek of themſelves what before they cou'd not be forc'd to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ask us another Queſtion: <hi>What if ſome have thought</hi> that <hi>alone a ſufficient Reaſon for their Occaſional Communion with a Church, with whom they have not a conſtant Communion, That they may teſtify to the World they Decline it not as no Church, but ſo far practically own it as the Reaſon of the thing requires; may not be ſuppoſed to do this, as thinking it a good Reaſon, whether it be ſo or no, without going againſt Conſcience herein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, Sir, I muſt ſuppoſe theſe <hi>It may be's,</hi> and <hi>Why may not's,</hi> are put in to make out what you ſaid <hi>Page.</hi> that you cou'd puzzle a mean Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0454100800:276"/>
both ways; and, I thank God, you are driven to the Neceſſity of theſe Arts. But to let you ſee theſe Suppoſitions may be replied to;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sir, the Church of <hi>England</hi> however, muſt own Her ſelf very much oblig'd to ſuch Gentlemen who will Conform only to Vindicate her Reputation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They may be ſuppoſed to do thus, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed to do ſo without a manifeſt groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and taking that for a good Reaſon which is none at all: For if, Sir, you will admit that a Man is in the Right as to himſelf, while he thinks he is ſo, then you open the way to the fatal Latitude of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Error; for no Man is guilty of an Error, as an Error, but as his Judgment may be perverted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf right, when he is wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 19. you are pleas'd to Object for me: <hi>Since, Sir, you think it not unlawful to Communicate with ſuch a Church ſometimes, why ſhou'd you not (for Common Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſake) do it always?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, if you pleaſe to give me leave to ask Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for my ſelf, I wou'd ſtate it ſomething more fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Caſe in hand, thus: <hi>Since, Sir, you think it not Unlawful to Communicate with ſuch a Church ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, why ſhou'd you not, to avoid the juſt Imputation of Schiſm, which is a great Sin, have done it always?</hi> And why never do it, but when upon an Occaſion of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment inviting, you find it neceſſary to protect you from the penalty of the Law?</p>
            <p>I ſhou'd ha' been very glad you had ſtated this Queſtion fully, and ſuppoſe what Anſwer you pleaſe; for <hi>upon my word,</hi> I <hi>can ſuppoſe none,</hi> unleſs I wou'd bring him in, owning the Crime, and repenting of it; which I ſhou'd be glad to hear of.</p>
            <p>What you ſay, I ſhall ſtare at, Page 20. I <hi>willingly admit, that what is ſimply beſt, may not be beſt for Practice in preſent Circumſtances.</hi> And I muſt likewiſe remind you, Sir, That what may be ſimply Lawful, may be

            </p>
            <p>Here, Sir, <hi>viz.</hi> at your 20th Page, I muſt leave you to combat with the <hi>Independents</hi> and let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for themſelves; I am not at all concern'd in the Quarrel.</p>

            <p>And now, Sir, I find you no more talking to me till you come to <hi>Page</hi> 25, where you are pleaſed to Satyrize upon my Title and Preface.</p>
            <p>Really, Sir, I believe my ſelf capable to Defend my Book againſt all that the Power of Cavil and Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0454100800:278"/>
can ſuggeſt; and therefore I am not ſollcitous for my Preface and Title-Page.</p>
            <p>But that I may ſatisfy your Requeſt: and telling you firſt, that you oblige me to it: I ſhall be plain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You deſire me to examine my own Heart, what I meant by that Suggeſtion? in Caſes of Preferment, mentioned in the Title; was it not to inſinuate, that Preferment was the inducement to that Worthy Perſon to act againſt his Conſcience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, Will you be pleaſed to <hi>Examine your own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> how that can be, when the Words were printed Three Years before the Fact; and I Appeal to God and the World, whether you have not wrongfully Judg'd me then. But to make it more plain:</p>
            <p>I do not ſay he, or any Body elſe does it for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>you are pleas'd ſtrangely to miſtake me:</hi> I ſay they may have the Preferment without it.</p>
            <p>'Tis done to ſave their Money, to ſave the Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, which is the Penalty of the Act: I am ſorry you have not Read the Book before you ventur'd to make ſo ſevere a Remark. For your better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, therefore, Sir, I refer you to <hi>p.</hi> 19. in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> where my Words are plain.</p>
            <p>As to the Worthy Gentleman, <hi>whoſe Cauſe you would have this to be;</hi> you ſay this has been his known Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice ſeveral Years.</p>
            <p>Tho' it were true, yet, Sir, this is no Argument to prove the thing lawful, or to prove that it is not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, even in every part that I have laid down, by others before him, and like to be ſo after him; it only quits him of doing it againſt his Conſcience, to q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ellſie himſelf for the unprofitable Preferment you mention: <hi>and this I never Charg'd him with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he had done the Fact, no Body Diſputes, but that he did it againſt his Conſcience, I never alledg'd; <hi>you put that upon me, Sir, unjuſtly:</hi> Be his Conſcience to God and himſelf, I know better than to judge him,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0454100800:279"/>
nor can you without a Breach of Charity ſuggeſt it of me.</p>
            <p>Nor do I any-where ſay that others have acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſciences that do ſo; poſſibly they may by the help of <hi>nice Diſtinguiſhing,</hi> Reaſon themſelves into a Belief of their being in the Right.</p>
            <p>But the Point in Debate is, Whether <hi>whatever their Opinions may be in the Caſe,</hi> the Act it ſelf be not, as I have ſaid, Circumſtantially ſinful: For I hope you will grant me they are never the more in the Right for its being their Opinion: Truth is always unmov'd, ſullen, and the ſame, whatever Gloſs our Fancy or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt puts upon it.</p>
            <p>But ſince you will have it be this Gentlemans pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which I think no Reputation to him, nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Practice: Nor do I think you or he can juſtifie your Diſſenting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that Practice together: Since, I ſay, you will have it be that Gentleman's practice; all you gain by that in point of Argument, is, That he did not do it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience, nor to ſerve the preſent Turn. And what then? I affirm to you, I neither meant him nor any Man elſe, but him that is Guilty; and I meant him, and every Body elſe, if they are guilty. And what is all this to the purpoſe? The Queſtion is not here, Who is, or is not guilty of it; but whether the thing in its own Nature, aggravated with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Turn and Return, timed for Preferment, with all the black <hi>Et cetera</hi>'s of it, as 'tis lately pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd, and as I have laid it down, be a Crime, or no?</p>
            <p>If this Gentleman you <hi>would Embroil me with,</hi> did formerly live in a general, or ordinary Communion, both with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, before eit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Preferments, I mention, invited, or the Penalty of the Law forced him to it; Then he ſtands clear of this part of the Charge, that he did it for the protection of his Intereſt; but ſtill the Matter of Fact is true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0454100800:280"/>
Thus, Sir, I have ſaid what I thought my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to by way of Reply to your Conſiderations: And as to your Cenſures, tho' I have a great Opinion of your Charity, however you ſeem to be out of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this Caſe; yet I appeal from your Judgment, to the Judgment of Truth; and waving all your puzzling Diſtinctions, which my Reſpect for your Perſon and Character, will not permit me to Deſcant upon; give me leave to make this ſhort Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Sincerity is the Glory of a Chriſtian; the Native Luſtre of an honeſt Heart is impoſſible to be hid; 'twill ſhine through all his Life in one Action or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpite of Scandal; and it wants no Artifice to ſet it out.</p>
            <p>If the Practice we Diſcourſe of be to be Defended, <hi>let it be a Practice;</hi> I mean, let it be Voluntary, let it be Free and Spontaneous; and if Gentlemen, who have ſuch a Latitude in their Opinions, wou'd not have it thought they are mov'd to it by their <hi>Intereſts,</hi> let them practice it openly, and not Time it ſo to the very <hi>Eve</hi> of an Election, as to have it ſpeak of it ſelf, and, as it were, force Men to believe it done on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; nay, let them not put ſuch a Reproach in the Mouths of their Enemies, as to have it ſpoken in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, with <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that ſtop the Mouths of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and are as <hi>Convincing</hi> as Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>You have given your Bleſſing to them at the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of your Book, with a <hi>Let them go on and proſper.</hi> I wiſh you have not ſpoken Peace where there is no Peace: As to its being a <hi>Secret between God and Them;</hi> I ſhall only ſay, <hi>Enter not into their Secret, O my Soul!</hi> 'Tis an <hi>Arcana</hi> that is hidden from my Eyes, and I doubt very much how it can conſiſt with conſulting the Rule with the ſerious Diligence you recommend: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were the great <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Rule conſulted, it wou'd inſtruct them, that the Profeſſion of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion is not a thing, the Forms whereof are
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0454100800:281"/>
of ſuch indifference, as you ſeem to make it; that 'tis not a light thing to ſhift and change <hi>Communion</hi> with an Eſtabliſh'd, and with a Separate <hi>Church,</hi> as often as Convenience, or Reaſon of State, or Intereſt invite.</p>
            <p>And whether I ſet my Name to this, or no? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am an <hi>Independent? I hope they are Chriſtians too as well as other folks.</hi> Whether I am a <hi>Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-man?</hi> Whether the Book was deſign'd againſt my Lord Mayor, <hi>tho' 'twas wrote Three Years before he was Choſen?</hi> Or, whether any thing elſe you Cenſoriouſly charge me with be true, or no, ſeems to me not worth your while to Examine? Since if I ſhou'd grant them all, the Argument of Occaſional Conformity remains untouch'd.</p>
            <p>If the Truth be made the worſe for my Temper, I am ſorry for it: But this is another of Mr. <hi>How</hi>'s Paradoxes, <hi>and ſomething like your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that Truth, tho' it be mix'd with the worſt Temper in the World, ſhou'd thereby be ſo debaſed as to become worſe than Error.</p>
            <p>Sir, I had ended here, but for a Clauſe you force me to Reply to, concerning the Old <hi>Puritans,</hi> who you tax me with abuſing: Indeed 'twas as remote from my Thoughts, as 'twas, that ever it was poſſible you cou'd treat an Adverſary with ſuch Language.</p>
            <p>And, but that I ſhall not ſuffer my ſelf to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond the Bounds of Civility, and ſo fall into your Error, I cou'd allow my ſelf to be very much mov'd, That ſuch a Man as you ſhould venture to Charge me with what is neither true in Fact, nor can be ſuggeſted by Conſequence from any thing I have wrote: And, Sir, you muſt give me leave to ſay, I am ſorry you ſhou'd lay your ſelf ſo open, and force me to ſo ſevere a Remark.</p>
            <p>You are pleas'd to affirm, That I induſtriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Primitive <hi>Engliſh</hi> Puritans, as if they were generally of my <hi>ſtingy, narrow</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0454100800:282"/>
And here you run upon me with ill Language, <hi>How I could think to Impoſe upon the World in a matter of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Memory;</hi> and, <hi>How I could have the Confidence,</hi> &amp;c. This is really a new ſort of Stile from Mr. <hi>How.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I have induſtriouſly examin'd the Book I wrote; and, as I am ſure I never entertain'd a Thought in prejudice of the beſt Character that can be given thoſe Primitive Reformers; ſo I cannot find one Word in the whole Book which can, no, not with the help of an <hi>Innuendo,</hi> be ſo much as pretended to look that way.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Sir, unleſs you can make it out, or, by the help of ſome of your Diſtinctions, come off from it; I hope you will do me ſo much Juſtice, as you are a Man of Truth and Honeſty, to recant the Scandal, and acknowledge your ſelf miſtaken.</p>
            <p>And that I may leave it to every body to Judge, whether I have not juſt Ground for what I ſay; I ſhall quote here all that I have ſaid relating to the <hi>Puritans,</hi> and impartially lay down the Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>After I had given a ſhort Abridgment of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and recited the Controverſie between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> I proceeded thus, Page the 6th. <hi>When Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>Reſtored the Proteſtant Religion, and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the firſt Eſtabliſhment of King</hi> Edward, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo on the Minds of Men, that the farther Reformation was rejected: The other Party being not at all Convinc'd, tho' Over-rul'd, ſubmitted their Perſons to the Laws, but not their Opinions; affirming, That it was the Duty of every Chriſtian to endeavour to ſerve God with the greateſt Purity of Worſhip as was poſſible; and that this was the pureſt Worſhip which came neareſt the Divine Inſtitution, which they believed the Eſtabliſh'd Liturgy did not; and therefore in Conſcience they muſt be Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made this Quotation, which I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authority to prove genuine, from a Manuſcript of a famous Man in thoſe days, which I have ſeen, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0454100800:283"/>
on occaſion am ready to produce: I go on thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It muſt be own'd, that the Original Authors of theſe Diſputes were Learned, Devout, and Singularly Pious, ſtrict in Converſation to Exceſs,</hi> if that were poſſible; <hi>and from thence in a ſort of happy Deriſion, were call'd</hi> Puritans: <hi>Of whom I ſhall ſay nothing, but leave for a Record the laſt Speech of a famous Foreigner;</hi>
               <q>Sit anima mea cum Puritanis Anglicanis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is all the Words that have the leaſt Retroſpect on the <hi>Puritans,</hi> unleſs you will pretend that a few words, <hi>Page</hi> 24. is meant of them, which no Man can have any Colour of Reaſon for: But leſt that ſhou'd be pretended, I ſhall quote them alſo, <hi>Page</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Diſſenters can never pretend to be Diſſenters upon the meer Principle of Purity of Worſhip, as I have related in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, if ſuch ſhall be receiv'd as blameleſs into their Communion, who have Deſerted them upon occaſion of Preferment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This refers back to <hi>Page</hi> 12. where, I ſay, I ſhall give my Eſſay as to what I underſtand a real Diſſenting Proteſtant is, nor can it refer to any other place: But <hi>if you ſhou'd ſtill ſay</hi> it looks back to the <hi>Puritans,</hi> 'twou'd puzzle a better Head than mine to find out a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them in it.</p>
            <p>But this is not the only thing in which you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to injure both me and the Truth: For, <hi>Page</hi> 28. you tell me with ſome Heat too, <hi>That throughout my Book, ſuch as are ſo ſtingily</hi> (your Favourite word, Sir) <hi>bigotted to a Party,</hi> as I, are treated with this ſort of Charity, to be ſtil'd <hi>Painted Hypocrites, ſuch as play Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peep with God Almighty, That if ſuch an Occaſion offer it ſelf to any of them to ſerve God and their Country in a publick Station, do what the Law requires, and which they may ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly do in order to it, do treſpaſs upon their Conſciences, and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> their Souls to ſave their Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0454100800:284"/>
Sir, <hi>for God-ſake,</hi> how came you to let your Paſſion thus out-run your Memory?</p>
            <p>There is not one word of all this true: <hi>Pardon me that I am oblig'd in my own Defence to ſay ſo: I</hi> refer you to the Criginal to convince your ſelf of it, and I'll take the pains to go along with you in the Examination.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to <hi>Painted Hypocrites,</hi> 'tis ſpoken of the whole Body of Proteſtants in <hi>England, in haec Verba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 8. <hi>I muſt acknowledge it fares with the Chsrch of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and with Diſſenters both, as it has always far'd with Chriſts Church in the whole World; that while ſuppreſs'd and perſecuted, their Profeſſors were few, and their Profeſſion more ſevere: But when Religion comes to be the Mode of a Country,</hi> ſo many Painted Hypocrites, there's the Word, <hi>get into the Church, that Guile is not to be ſeen till it arrive to Apoſtacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray, Sir, who can theſe <hi>Painted Hypocrites</hi> refer to, that you ſhould ſay, <hi>Innuendo, All thoſe that are not of my Party, or that are not ſo ſtingy as I?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe painted Hypocrites muſt belong to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is the Mode of the Country: which muſt rather mean the Church of <hi>England</hi> than the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and yet if I meant either of them, it cannot be made a Reflection, becauſe 'tis confin'd only to ſuch as are Apoſtates from Religion, not ſuch as continue to Conform to both or either of them.</p>
            <p>This is Judging me indeed neither with <hi>Charity</hi> nor Truth: The next Words are, <hi>Such as play Bo-peep with God Almighty.</hi> Pray, good Sir, reflect on <hi>Solomon,</hi> and what is ſaid of ſuch as judge of a Matter before they hear it: I am perſwaded you did not read the Clauſe; which is thus:</p>
            <p>I had been Examining the Woful Excuſe of ſome people, and <hi>too many ſuch we had,</hi> who wou'd take the Sacrament at the Church, and pretend 'twas done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Civil Action; on which I made ſuch Remarks as, I think, ſo prophane a Practice deſerv'd; and at
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0454100800:285"/>
laſt added, <hi>This is playing Bo-peep with God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, pray Sir, if I may be ſo free with you, do but examine the Circumſtance as I have laid it down, and tell me from the Sincerity of your Soul, if <hi>you are not of the ſame Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Reflection is on ſuch, who, tho' it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſciences, pretend 'tis to ſerve their Country: Of theſe, I ſay, <hi>They are Patriots indeed, who will Damn their Souls to ſave their Country:</hi> Not that thereby I imply, that to take the Sacrament with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wou'd Damn any Mans Soul, if he communicated with a right Principle; but to do it to ſerve a Turn, which is the Queſtion in hand, I won't anſwer for, tho' it were inverted from the Church to a Diſſenting Congregation.</p>
            <p>All theſe Inſtances, Sir, and more which I could reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up, ſerve to make me admire wherein I have ſo provok'd you, as to remove you from your wonted Candor: And ſince my Writing on a Cauſe, which I expected fairer Quarter in, ſo exceedingly moves you, I ſhall chuſe rather to lay down the Controverſy, than to engage with a Perſon, who I ſhou'd be very much concern'd to ſee exceed the Rules which he has with ſo much Succeſs, and ſo much Applauſe preſcrib'd to others.</p>
            <p>I always thought Men might Diſpute without Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Differ without Quarrelling; and that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions need not affect our Tempers: But ſince it is not to be found, I leave it to thoſe who have a better Talent that way than I.</p>
