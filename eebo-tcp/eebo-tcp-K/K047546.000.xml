            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS to the PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>THE comedy here offered to the world, having been baniſhed from the theatre, through the rage of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical prejudice, and the author having, through that prejudice, been no leſs attacked in his reputation than wounded in his fortune, it becomes neceſſary for him to juſtify his character as a man, however poor his abilities may be as a writer. — Popular reſentment has had it's victim, and the ſacrifice being now over, perhaps a few words may be heard in his defence.</p>
            <p>For a conſiderable time, previous to the exhibition of the following ſcenes, two charges were induſtriouſly propagated againſt the author; and to theſe charges the unexampled ſeverity exerciſed on his play may be wholly attributed: The firſt was, that Mr. Kelly proſtituted the Public Ledger, a daily paper then under his direction, to the purpoſes of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, in conſequence of an annual penſion he received; and, inſtead of conducting it upon principles of impartiality, would admit no letters whatever, unleſs profeſſedly written in favour of government. — This accuſation, though conſtantly rendered abſurd by his readineſs to inſert every proper letter on each ſide of every public ſubject, gained no little credit, but gained it intirely among thoſe who would not be at the trouble of examining into the truth. — At length the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny grew ſerious enough to demand ſome notice, and accordingly, on the 14th of February, 1769, the following reply was publiſhed in the Ledger, to a freſh attack by an anonymous correſpondent upon the independency of that paper.</p>
            <q>
               <p>We can aſſure this gentleman (meaning the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) that we have never ſuppreſſed any thing in favour of Mr. Wilkes's cauſe, which was in the leaſt proper for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication: But declare on the contrary, that we always <hi>have</hi> been and always <hi>ſhall</hi> be as ready to inſert the productions of his friends, as the letters of his enemies. — Many pieces on <hi>both</hi> ſides have reached us, which we were under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of rejecting, becauſe they were too dangerous, or too abſurd for admittance: yet we can with great truth aver, that we ſtrictly keep to our title, and maintain the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate impartiality, — we profeſs <hi>ourſelves open to all</hi>
                  <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0670102900:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>parties,</hi> and cannot conſiſtently with this profeſſion refuſ <hi>any</hi> performance which ſeems dictated by a ſpirit of can dour, or an appearance of rational argument. Our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, therefore, before he calls us <hi>partial,</hi> ſhould really <hi>prove</hi> us ſo; and ſhould firſt of all favour us with his eſſays in <hi>defence</hi> of Mr. Wilkes, before he pronounces poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that we will <hi>not</hi> indulge them with a <hi>place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fact, a paper to maintain a <hi>real</hi> impartiality, muſt be actuated by the principles of <hi>juſtice,</hi> not by the fear of <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> on the one hand, nor the hope of <hi>approbation</hi> on the other; and the conductors of it muſt be more ſolicitous to <hi>deſerve</hi> the applauſe of their readers, than to <hi>obtain</hi> it. — Had the managers of the Ledger for inſtance, rejected any piece which came <hi>againſt</hi> the cauſe of Mr. Wilkes, through an apprehenſion of incurring the popular diſpleaſure, they would have violated the aſſurance of <hi>impartiality,</hi> which they have ſo ſolemnly given to the public, and the opponents of that gentleman, would have a reaſonable plea to reproach them with their palpable breach of faith. To accuſe them conſequently of <hi>partiality,</hi> argues a <hi>partiality</hi> in their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; and it is rather unfair in thoſe, to deny others a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſpeaking upon national affairs, who conſtantly lay claim to ſuch a privilege themſelves,</p>
               <p>Theſe gentlemen muſt however remember, that, though the Ledger is <hi>open</hi> to all parties, it is influenced by <hi>none</hi>: And that the conductors, to <hi>merit</hi> the good opinion of <hi>all,</hi> muſt no more make a ſacrifice of their juſtice at the ſhrine of <hi>popularity,</hi> than at the altar of <hi>government</hi>: they can therefore only repeat, that the advocates for Mr. Wilkes, will always be as acceptable to them, as any other correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents, and they <hi>call</hi> upon his friends in this manner, to favour them with productions in his defence. What more can be deſired at their hands? If the popular writers decline this candid invitation, the editors of the Ledger are intirely free from blame. They have bound themſelves in a promiſe of undeviating impartiality to the <hi>whole</hi> public, and muſt by no means act inequitably to thoſe who <hi>do</hi> oblige them with pieces for inſertion, out of an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deference for thoſe who do <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This advertiſement Mr. Kelly flattered himſelf would effectually undeceive the public; but here he was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſappointed. Many who had repeatedly heard the charge againſt him, never once honoured the defence with a peruſal; while many more who really read it, conſidered the very candour of it's declaration as a proof of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, and would not allow any weight to the argument of <hi>juſtice,</hi> when oppoſed to what they looked upon as the cauſe of the people. — Mr. Kelly, however, determined, at
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0670102900:4"/>
all events, to do his duty, conducted the Ledger on it's cuſtomary plan of <hi>impartiality,</hi> and many of the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular gentlemen who have arraigned his conduct in the capacity of a public editor, well know that their letters, inſtead of being rejected, have been frequently inſerted at the warning of an hour. — Beſides, a review of the Ledger during Mr. Kelly's ſuperintendency, will convince the moſt incredulous, that the ſevereſt animadverſions were admitted on the proceedings of adminiſtration. — It was not Mr. Kelly's fault if the publications on the contrary ſide were the moſt numerous. — The correſpondents of a news-paper will make it what they pleaſe, and the editor is not to conſider in whoſe favour they write, but whether their writings are proper for inſertion. — Whatever Mr. Kelly's own ſentiments might be on political affairs, this was the only object of his inquiry: and it will appear, on a retroſpection of the pieces printed, while he directed the Ledger, that Mr. Kelly has frequently complimented popular writers on account of their abilities, and civilly requeſted a continuation of their correſpondence. — As to Mr. Kelly's own letters in the Ledger, they appeared but occaſionally, from the number of volunteers who eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowded to the general ſervice: Yet he will candidly confeſs, that when they did appear, they were not always in favour of popularity. This conſtitutes the ſecond charge againſt him; and as he is above the deſpicable littleneſs of prevaricating, he will enter with confidence, and he hopes with decency, upon his juſtification.</p>
            <p>Whether it has been Mr. Kelly's merit or demerit, to think from principle unpopularly, on the ſubject of the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſſenſions, he will not pretend to ſay, but certainly it has been his misfortune; and though ſeveral of his diſcreeter friends repeatedly warned him of the danger his next piece would run on the ſtage, from an open declaration of his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical opinions; ſtill he did not imagine, that his profeſſion as a public writer was to deprive him of his independence as a man —As he never preſumed to be offended with the ſentiments of others on matters of a national tendency, he claimed a right of expreſſing his own; and did not ſuppoſe his lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary character, precluded him from ſpeaking upon a point which was the continual object of literary inveſtigation. — Beſides this, he little conceived that the advocates for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thinking, would be the firſt to manacle the mind; that the profeſſed friends of candour would be the firſt to condemn without a hearing; and the avowed enemies of oppreſſion be the only perſons ready to exerciſe an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable ſeverity — He had at leaſt a right to juſtice, if he had no pretence to favour, and merited ſurely a trial, though he might afterwards deſerve to be condemned.—
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0670102900:5"/>
The heated hour of prejudice however, is not the hour of ſober reflection; at ſuch a ſeaſon the very virtues of our hearts frequently lead us into miſtakes; and we run into exceſſes which our cooler reaſon muſt diſapprove, from an actual rectitude of intention. This was the caſe of numbers who oppoſed the exhibition of Mr. Kelly's play: they had been told he was a deſpicable mercenary, hired to write away their liberties, and therefore conſidered him as a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper candidate for public approbation — they had been informed, that at the memorable trials of Mr Gillam, and of the ſoldier at Guildford, in conſequence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy affair in St. George's fields, he had ſtood forth an advocate for the effuſion of innocent blood; of courſe they beheld him with deteſtation; and their motive was really reſpectable, though their reſentment was wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by miſinformation or miſtake.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed Mr. Kelly, as well as an account of the two remarkable trials juſt mentioned, wrote, during the courſe of our domeſtic diſunion, many other papers in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government, and in vindication of parliament; but he never exerciſed his trifling pen where he did not ſuppoſe both to be right, nor delivered a ſingle ſentence that was not the reſult of his ampleſt conviction. — With regard to the two trials, he repreſented them as they really <hi>were,</hi> not as they might be <hi>wiſhed</hi> in print, by the <hi>over</hi> zealous advocates of freedom. — And ſo far was he from being once employed, ſince his exiſtence, by adminiſtration, to exert his poor abilities in their cauſe, that he here proteſts, before the public, he never <hi>expected</hi> or <hi>received</hi> the ſmalleſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument for his little ſervices. — Never was <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly</hi> connected with a miniſter in his days, nor has he even at this moment, though ſuffering ſo ſeverely on account of his attachment to government, either <hi>ſolicited</hi> or <hi>received</hi> a ſhilling compenſation for that bread, which he and his family have loſt in it's defence.</p>
            <p>HERE poſſibly Mr. Kelly may be aſked, how, <q>unplac'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion'd, no man's heir or ſlave,</q> he could be idle enough to riſk the favour of a town, that had honoured him with the warmeſt marks of approbation in his firſt dramatic attempt, for the mere purpoſe of ſerving a government from which he had not received the minuteſt favour or protection? To this Mr. Kelly replies, that in ſerving government, where he thought it <hi>ought</hi> to be ſerved, he looked upon himſelf as rendering very eſſential benefit to the community. — Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the duty of every good ſubject to promote, inſtead of diſturbing, the national tranquility, he uſed his humble endeavours, rather to extinguiſh than animate the torch of public diſcord, and ſtrove, as far as ſo inſignificant an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0670102900:6"/>
could ſtrive, to wreſt it from the hand of every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical enthuſiaſt, who madly attempted to ſet his country in flames. With this view he particularly gave an account of the two trials that have expoſed him to ſo much unmerited obloquy. Being well convinced, that, during the rage of party, truth would undergo a torture upon the wheel of prejudice, Mr. Kelly, determined to give a faithful narrative of theſe remarkable deciſions. He accordingly attended; he accordingly gave a real ſtate of both to the world; and though he has been calumniated in the groſs, as a ſhameleſs abettor of murder, no attempt has hitherto been made to point out, in his repreſentation, the ſmalleſt perverſion of a fact. — This was eaſy to be done, had he been employed as the verniſher of guilt; the trials were not carried on in ſecret, but in the full face of day; not ſolely before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of a court, but before the warmeſt ſons of popularity: Mr. Kelly was not culpable if the priſoners were wholly without blame; he only acquitted thoſe in his relation, who were acquitted by the laws of their country, and only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained <hi>how</hi> that innocence was made apparent, which the <hi>too</hi> deciſſive voice of partiality had previouſly condemned.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kelly's account of the trials was received with general ſurprize, becauſe the public, by a ſucceſſion of papers in the daily and other prints, had been taught to conſider Mr. Gillam and the ſoldier unqueſtionably guilty. — On their acquittal therefore the <hi>intemperate</hi> friends to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular cauſe, (Mr. Kelly ſays the <hi>intemperate</hi> friends, becauſe he knows many of the moſt rational, as well as the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy members of the community, from <hi>principle</hi> in oppoſition,) wiſhed to throw a ſtigma on the court, where they were tried, and wiſhed to prejudice the world with an opinion, that both owed their preſervation more to the dexterity of judicial chicane, than to their real innocence. — Mr. Kelly, however, by ſetting the tranſactions in a plain, an honeſt light, prevented the intended inſult to the courts, but drew the whole weight of party reſentment upon himſelf, and the doctrine having been long ſucceſsfully inculcated among the people, that whoever ſpoke, much leſs whoever wrote, againſt popular prejudices, muſt neceſſarily be the hireling of government, Mr. Kelly became gradually ſtigmatized into ſuch a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of politcal conſequence, that the ſuppreſſion of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was conſidered as a triumph over adminiſtration; ſo that the curtain was no ſooner raiſed on the firſt night than a loud hiſſing prevented the performers from begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the play a considerable time; — while on the other hand, the plaudits of Mr. Kelly's numerous friends, to whoſe goodneſs he ſtands eternally indebted, as well as of the unprejudiced, who deſired to give him a fair hearing, and afterwards to expreſs their cenſure or approbation, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the confuſion general. At laſt the performance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0670102900:7"/>
— but went on with inceſſant interruptions; except only in the third act, to the concluſion. The performers totally diſconcerted by the tumult, were unable to exerciſe their abilities, or to remember their parts — whole ſpeeches, eſſentially neceſſary to the conduct of the fable, were left out, and others mutilated for the ſake of brevity. —In ſhort, the ſole conſideration was to get the comedy through the five acts in <hi>any manner.</hi> — This, with much difficulty, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffected, and it was given out for the following Monday. A new conteſt now aroſe: the oppoſers of the play inſiſted, with an uncuſtomary ſeverity, that it ſhould never be exhibited again. — The ſupporters inſiſted that it ſhould, on the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, according to the public intimation from Mr. King; but Mr. Kelly, fearing the conſequences of a diſpute that appeared extremely ſerious, propoſed behind the ſcenes, to withdraw his piece at once, for the ſake of reſtoring peace, and the tragedy of Cymbeline was given out in it's room.</p>
            <p>This conciliating meaſure, however, was not attended with the deſired effect. The friends of the play, who were greatly the majority, would by no means admit the comedy to be withdrawn; and, after the farce, above two hundred gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men calling out for the manager, and threatening immediate demolition, to the houſe, if A WORD to the WISE was not performed, as originally given out, Mr. Lacy, the only manager then in town, ſent Mr. Hopkins, the prompter, to aſſure the company it ſhould, and all terminated peaceably for that evening.</p>
            <p>It was no difficult matter to foreſee that the theatre, on the ſucceeding Monday night, would be a ſcene of freſh tumult; and the conſequences appearing more and more alarming to Mr. Kelly, he went to Mr. Garrick, who came to town on the Sunday morning, to conſult with him on the beſt means of preſerving peace, and it was concluded, that Mr. Kelly ſhould wait on his friends, and requeſt that they would give up the point. — Mr. Kelly accordingly did ſo, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the intereſts of a ſingle individual were of little conſideration, when weighed againſt the repoſe of a whole public. — He obſerved, as he has repeatedly done in the courſe of the preſent narrative, that prejudices had been ſtrongly propagated againſt him, and that the very ſeverity he had experienced from many of his enemies, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable in the manner, yet in the motive was really lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The moment of party heat, he frequently added, was not the moment to reaſon; and that however he might be injured in his circumſtances, by the ſuppreſſion of his play, he would ſuffer the injury with pleaſure, if he could by any means reſtore the tranquility of the town, which he had ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, though ſo innocently, diſturbed. — To this his friends replied, that the cauſe was not his cauſe now, but
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0670102900:8"/>
the public's; that if party diſputes were once introduced into the theatre, our moſt rational amuſements muſt be quickly at an end, that the number of writers at preſent for the ſtage was ſufficiently ſmall, and that they would not ſuffer the town to be controuled in it's pleaſures from private pique or perſonal reſentment: all they contended for was a fair hearing for the piece; that if it deſerved condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they themſelves would be the firſt to give it up; but, till it received an equitable trial, they would not allow a triumph to prejudice profeſſed, and acknowledged partiality.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate the affair reſted till the Monday evening, when, on Mr. King's appearance, to ſpeak the prologue, the oppoſition, with increaſed numbers, hiſſed, cat-called, and threw oranges: on the other ſide the demand for the new play was equally violent, the ſupporters turned ſeveral out of the houſe, whom they conſidered as general diſturbers; however Mr. Garrick went on, in the author's name, with a formal renunciation of every emolument, of every reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing from his ſmall endeavours for the public amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; adding, that he was not only ready, but deſirous to concur with their pleaſure, though to the total diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of his wiſhes and intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and begged the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he then ſo chearfully offered might be allowed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the contention. Things nevertheleſs continued in the ſame confuſion for a conſiderable time, — during which Mr. Garrick often retired and returned, — but at laſt advanced with a paper in his hand, from Mr. Kelly, containing a written repetition of the foregoing requeſt, and deſiring permiſſion, as the only means of re-eſtabliſhing harmony, to withdraw his comedy wholly from the theatre.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Garrick attempted to read this paper, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was made from the gallery, to know whether it was a political production, but though the demand occaſioned no little laughter among the oppoſers of the piece, it only augmented the ſpirit of the author's friends, by rendering the views of party ſtill more and more viſible. — The play of Cymbeline being loudly inſiſted upon on the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nd, was loudly prohibited on the other; and near three hours having paſſed in acts of annoyance and hoſtility, Mr. Kelly was ſo exceedingly alarmed for the event, that he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Though in no degree ſo ſucceſsful as he wiſhed, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſo far prevailed, that a propoſition on his
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0670102900:9"/>
retiring was ſuggeſted for Falſe Delicacy to be given the enſuing night, for his benefit by way of compromiſe: a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman then ſtood up in the pit, and aſked Mr. Garrick, whether conſenting to theſe meaſures would, or would not, be an impediment to Mr. Kelly's bringing any future productions on the ſtage — to which that gentleman had no ſooner given a negative, than a ſecond perſon from the gallery cried out, Expulſion means incapacitation. Mr. Kelly, acquainted with theſe particulars, went to Mr. Garrick and declined the favour intended him — obſerving, that he by no means meant to wring a benefit from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the public — that if he deſerved one benefit he was intitled to three, and that the theatre had already ſuſtained ſufficient loſs upon his account. — But Mr. Garrick generouſly told him, that the theatre was much the beſt able to bear a loſs; though, ſuppoſing the caſe otherwiſe, neither he nor Mr. Kelly, as public men, had a right on that occaſion to diſpute a determination of the public. Here the matter reſted for that night, as there was no play, the money was returned, and the audience retired ſeemingly well recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the compromiſe of the foregoing even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and notwithſtanding Mr. Kelly deſired that the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bills ſhould contain no intimation that the performance of Falſe Delicacy was intended for his benefit, a report univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally prevailed that the oppoſition were determined not to ſuffer the exhibition of Falſe Delicacy, which had long been honoured with the approbation of all parties, merely becauſe it was written by the author of a Word to the Wiſe. Mr. Kelly on this, imagining that the circumſtance of his being to receive the profits, of the night, and not any objection which could be raiſed to an eſtabliſhed comedy, muſt be the ſole foundation of this freſh reſentment, waited upon his friends and begged they would allow him to relinquiſh his title to theſe profits ſince they were ſo likely to renew the diſturbances of the theatre. His friends however were for a long time inflexible — they pronounced a violation of the compromiſe, no leſs injurious to the public, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting to them, and added, that they would never have liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any compromiſe, if he had not been ſo importunately ſolicitous to give up every thing for peace — but Mr. Kelly repreſenting the prejudice the managers muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuſtain, by a contention of the preſent nature between the public, and pointing out the prejudice alſo which every individual belonging to the play-houſe muſt as neceſſarily ſuſtain, by an interruption of the cuſtomary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs — his friends yielded to theſe arguments, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mr. Kelly to forego the advantages of the night, to
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0670102900:10"/>
prevent the managers and the performers from ſuffering in a diſpute, where it was equally their intereſt and their duty to conſult the wiſhes of the auditors.</p>
            <p>Theſe precautions being taken by Mr. Kelly, he repaired to the theatre on the Tueſday evening with ſome degree of ſatisfaction; but, on the opening of the play the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was as violent as ever, though Mr. Garrick, from Mr. Kelly, aſſured the oppoſition, that the play was not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the benefit of the author — This aſſurance how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was by no means ſufficient; the comedy of Falſe Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy was written by Mr. Kelly, and therefore though in poſſeſſion of the ſtage among the number of ſtock play<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The heat with which proceedings were thus conducted on the part of oppoſition, gave room to imagine, that the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would, as upon the preceding night, be diſmiſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any play. — But Mr. Kelly's friends were now no longer able to ſuppreſs their indignation, and being determined to make no farther conceſſions, they exerted themſelves ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, that Falſe Delicacy was performed, though with very conſiderable interruption. — Whole ſpeeches, nay, whole ſcenes were obliged to be omitted, and ſuch was the rage of undiſtinguiſhing prejudice, that it even attacked the perſonal ſafety of the female performers — This was not all, when the attempt to ſuppreſs Falſe Delicacy proved abortive, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the author demanded their money, and appeared

unwilling to pay for the miſchief they really <hi>did,</hi> becauſe, they had not effected as much as they actually <hi>wiſhed</hi> to <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The concluſion of the farce happily produced a general calm, and though the theatrical horizon ſeemed pregnant with a ſtorm the ſucceeding evening, it's ſerenity ſtill continued, and perhaps, will never be again diſturbed by any of Mr. Kelly's productions. There is nothing more neceſſary to add with regard to the exhibition of <hi>A Wora to the Wiſe,</hi> than that ſuch was the judicious conduct of Mr. Garrick and Mr. King, that what they gained on the one hand, they never loſt on the other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> been the only object of their attention, ſo it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent the public tranquility was, in the ſecond, the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their care: And whatever inconveniences they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might be expoſed to, they were incapable of deviating from the rules of politeneſs, of good ſenſe, and manly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion.</p>
            <p>After a ſacrifice of his intereſt, ſo ample, ſo unreſerved, for the ſake of reſtoring tranquility in the theatre, it might perhaps be expected that Mr. Kelly's enemies would have thought themſelves ſufficiently gratified; but prejudice has many appetites to glut, and we ſeldom liſten to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of juſtice, where we have publicly committed a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon our reaſon. — It was therefore no way wonderful, though his cauſe was the common cauſe of letters, to find many of the periodical prints conſtantly filled with the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſcurrilities againſt him; but, in this they rather gratified his pride, than wounded his ſenſibility; they only exalted him on the roll of ſlander, among the moſt illuſtrious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in the kingdom, and made him an object of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by making him an object of implacable reſentment.</p>
            <p>One attack however he cannot help mentioning in this place, though it leads to a repetition of the Guildford Trial, becauſe it came from a quarter wholly unexpected; and from a quarter alſo too reſpectable to be overlooked, from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. Horne, at the meeting of the Middleſex freeholders at Mile-End, on Friday the 30th of April. At this meeting Mr. Horne, in ſumming up the various grievances under which he ſuppoſed the nation groaning from the tyranny of adminiſtration, took occaſion to deſcant on the ſoldier's trial for the murder of the unfortunate Mr. Allen, and expreſſed himſelf thus — <q>It is neceſſary to give you an account of Maclean's trial, becauſe the judge forbad it's being taken down by any one, <hi>except it was government.</hi> — It has never been publiſhed — A very falſe account of this trial has indeed been publiſhed by Mr. KELLY, who was paid and brought to Guildford for that purpoſe, and who had lodgings taken for him there, and who was familiarly converſant with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe name I ſhall not mention now, leſt it ſhould
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0670102900:12"/>
ſeem to proceed from reſentment in me, for an account I have to ſettle with him next week; however one circumſtance I ought to tell you; this gentleman was foreman of the grand jury.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Without dwelling on Mr. Horne's extraordinary tenderneſs to the gentleman whoſe name he will not mention, while he points him clearly out to every apprhenſion, Mr. Kelly will ſuppoſe that what was aſſerted with regard to him, Mr. Horne himſelf believed to be indiſputably true — Nay, Mr. Kelly is ſeriouſly of this opinion, becauſe many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of unqueſtionable veracity have aſſured him, that, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the intemperance of party, Mr. Horne is in his underſtanding enlarged, and in his diſpoſition liberal. On theſe accounts however, Mr. Kelly differed from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, he always reſpected Mr Horne's private character, and did juſtice to what he conſidered the well meaning, though miſtaken zeal of the ſoirited freeholder, in the moment of his deepeſt concern at hearing a miniſter of peace, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcord through his country, and expreſſing an impatience of dying the veſtments of his ſacred function, in the blood of his fellow ſubjects.</p>
            <p>But though Mr. Kelly readily makes this conceſſion in favour of Mr. Horne's private character, he muſt obſerve, that the conſtitution of this country, for the purity of which Mr. Horne is ſo ſtrenuous an advocate, does not allow the mere <hi>belief</hi> of any man to be <hi>poſitive</hi> evidence, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment his ſimple <hi>conjecture</hi> with the force of a <hi>fact.</hi> — For this reaſon, Mr. Horne ſhould be extremely cautious how he aſſerts any thing to the prejudice of another's reputation; <hi>hearſay</hi> authority is not enough for this purpoſe; he ſhould know of his own <hi>knowledge</hi> what he aſſerts upon his own <hi>word</hi>; and be <hi>certain</hi> in his <hi>proof,</hi> where he is <hi>peremptory</hi> in his <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> — If a circumſpection of this nature is neceſſary in every man of honour, it muſt give Mr. Horne much mortification to hear, after he has repreſented Hugh Kelly, to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of Middleſex, as a venal ſcribler, a ſhameleſs inſtrument of power, an atrocious defender of murder, that the whole charge ſhould be utterly groundleſs— That Kelly's account of Maclean's trial, ſhould be true in every circumſtance, that Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never expected or received a ſhilling for writing it, and that in the courſe of his days he has not once changed a ſyllable with Mr Onſlow, notwithſtanding the <hi>converſant familiarity</hi> at Guildford.</p>
            <p>Strange however as all theſe things muſt appear, after Mr. Horne's poſitive affirmation to the contrary, all theſe things are moſt religiouſly veritable; and Mr. Horne is in this public manner called upon to prove an iota of his charge; it is his buſineſs to ſupport his own allegations, not Mr. Kelley's, to
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0670102900:13"/>
endeavour at eſtabliſhing negatives. — Let him therefore ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedly proceed to his proofs. — He has pronounced Mr. Kelly guilty, let him now ſhew in what his guilt conſiſts. — The moſt tyrannical miniſter can do no more than convict without evidence—in him however deſpotiſm is to be expected. But ſurely the rigid advocate for juſtice will not follow ſo dangerous an example; he will act reaſonably while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for reaſon, and conduct himſelf upon principles of legality, while he is generouſly ſtruggling for the preſervation of the laws.</p>
            <p>In reality, if there is no more foundation in Mr. Horne's celebrated ſpeech, for the charges brought againſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than for the charges urged againſt Mr. Kelly, the catalogue of public grievances is rather ludicrous than me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. But without troubling Mr. Horne to ſupport his aſſertions, Mr. Kelly will ſhew theſe very aſſertions ſelf-refuted; he will prove them as inconſiſtent, as they are poſitive, and reſt his defence entirely on the nature of Mr. Horne's accuſation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Horne ſets out with ſaying that the judge would not ſuffer the trial to be taken down by any body, except it was for government — Several nevertheleſs took it down, and among the reſt Mr. Chinnery and Mr. Gurney the profeſſed ſhort hand writers—Numbers beſides committed the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial paſſages to paper, and ſome to Mr. Kelly's knowledge <hi>not</hi> for Government; but, Mr. Kelly will ſay, that had he been hired by <hi>adminiſtration</hi> for the infamous purpoſe Mr. Horne mentions, it is not likely that the uſe of a pen would have been at all permitted in the court; it is not likely, that the judge would allow a <hi>real</hi> account of a trial to be taken, where a proſtitute writer was particularly employed to <hi>miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent</hi> it, nor is it likely that the miniſtry, while wiſhing to ſtand well with the world, would furniſh ſuch palpable evidence of it's own diſhonour—If there was any thing ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in the proceeding of the court — If an unwarrantable ſtretch of power reſcued the priſoner from juſtice, why has not the tranſaction been held up to univerſal in dignation? — Why is it not recorded in the liſt of grievances preſented to the throne? — To make a ſolemn court of judicature the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar of deſpotic authority would have been a crime of the firſt magnitude; it would have ſhaken the conſtitution to it's centre, and overwhelmed the miniſter with inevitable deſtruction. — But, wicked as ſome gentlemen in oppoſition might ſuppoſe the Government, they could not ſuppoſe it weak enough to overturn the laws thus deſperately at once, for the mere end of ſaving a private foot ſoldier from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a pardon was an eaſy expedient, and mercy was not then conſidered criminal—Beſides, were the oſtenſible men in power as ruthleſs as they have been painted, they would
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0670102900:14"/>
have given the priſoner up at once, they would have been regardleſs of his fate, nor would they have attempted to ſave him from the gibbet, by methods that muſt have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably hurried themſelves to the block. The queſtion is not whether the unhappy Mr. Allen loſt a ſon, but Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſon fell by the hands of Maclean? — Humanity is melted when it thinks of a ſlaughtered child, and a weeping father — But humanity muſt ſtill be juſt — it muſt not with for victims without guilt, nor dry up the tears of ſorrowing relations with a ſacrifice of unoffending blood.</p>
            <p>The laſt part of Mr. Horne's aſſertion is to the full as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary as the firſt. Mr. Kelly is made culpable for being <hi>farmiliarly converſant</hi> with the foreman of the grand jury at <hi>Guildford</hi>; though certainly, if there was a neceſſity for any mention of the grand juryman he ought to be mentioned with reſpect; becauſe the grand jury <hi>found</hi> the bill <hi>againſt</hi> Maclean, and conſequently, in that circumſtance, advanced the very wiſhes of popularity — Inſtead therefore of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Mr. Kelly for his intimacy with Mr. Onſlow in the preſent caſe, that intimacy ought to be an argument in Mr. Kelly's favour — But the truth is, Mr. Kelly in the whole courſe of his exiſtence, never once ſpoke to Mr. Onſlow, the grand juryman alluded to, knowing who he was, nor he believes at any rate, becauſe he knows Mr. Onſlow's perſon, and is flattered with the poſſeſſion of a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable memory—however, if Mr. Horne has evidence to the contrary—let him produce it — if not, let him for the future be more certain of his facts, or leſs peremptory in his aſſertions.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly, though Mr. Horne is a ſtrong enemy to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination by interrogatory, he may nevertheleſs chooſe to aſk Mr. Kelly what buſineſs carried him to Guildford, if he did not go as a literary proſtitute in favour of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? To this Mr. Kelly will reply with another queſtion, What buſineſs had Mr. Horne there? Mr. Kelly ſurely has as much right to indulge his curioſity, and to ſupport what he conceives a juſt cauſe, as that gentleman — Mr. Horne cannot be a warmer well wiſher to true freedom, and to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional happineſs than Mr. Kelly, though he purſues a very different plan of promoting them — Mr. Kelly's political opinions may be erroneous — but his intention is right — Had he been the venal thing he is repreſented, he might have carried his venality to a certain market — Popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe is always fortune to a public writer of prudence, and the part Mr. Kelly has taken may be an impeachment of his judgment, but argues no depravity of his heart.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, with regard to Mr. Horne, if Mr. Kelly's account of the Guildford trial i. falſe, let Mr. Horne point
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0670102900:15"/>
the fallacy out; if Mr. Kelly has been hired to write it let Mr. Horne mention by whom—and if it is criminal to be <hi>familiarly converſant</hi> with Mr. Onſlow, let Mr. Horne ſupport a ſingle inſtance of Mr. Kelly's familiarity with that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. — Mr. Horne ſoon after Mr. Kelly's account of the Guildford trial appeared, promiſed the world <hi>a true ſtate</hi> of that remarkable affair, and if Mr. Kelly ſhamefully miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented facts, the appearance of Mr. Horne's pamphlet was doubly neceſſary — That pamphlet has never yet appeared; and it cannot be ſuppoſed that a temper ſo ready to fire at light occaſions as Mr. Horne's, would ſuppreſs it, had there been any material cauſe of complaint to lay before the people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kelly has taken up a great deal of room with his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling concerns, for which he ought to apologize, but as the publication of his play by ſubſcription, proceeded entirely from the generous partiality of his friends, he thought it his duty to let them at leaſt ſee, that though they might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a dull writer, they were encouraging an honeſt man—The piece, with all it's imperfections on it's head, is now before the world; and the author hopes, if it ſhould even ſet the reader faſt aſleep, that nothing it contains will rouze his indignation: the moſt careful father he thinks may put it into the hands of his daughter, without any fear of wounding her delicacy, or unhinging her principles—This is it's chief, perhaps it's only merit, and perhaps, had it been heard on the ſtage with patience, it might have been condemned with juſtice — Mr. Kelly will therefore conſole himſelf with his optimiſt Willoughby, by thinking every thing happens for the beſt, and look upon that very prejudice which has ſuppreſſed his poor performance as ultimately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, ſince it may have been the means of preſerving his little ſhare of reputation.</p>
            <p>He cannot however conclude this addreſs without an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or two upon the melancholy ſituation of dramatic writers—and as it is poſſible that he himſelf may never more venture a production on the ſtage, he hopes what he has further to advance, will merit an additional conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his readers.</p>
            <p>The great decline of dramatic genius in this country, has been for many years an object of general concern with the public, and the lovers of the theatre have ardently wiſhed, that ſome happy ſtimulus might be diſcovered to encreaſe the number of writers for the ſtage; yet, though this wiſh has prevailed univerſally, and though the credit, as well as the emolument ariſing from a ſucceſsful play is not; a little tempting, ſtill the danger attending the repreſentation of the beſt pieces, is ſo conſiderable, that the few writers bleſſed with eaſy fortunes do not chooſe to run the hazard, and

moſt of thoſe who live by the ſale of their productions, are content to follow ſtudies leſs profitable, for a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reward of their labours.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the difficulty, the toil, the downright drudgery of writing a good play is inconceivable; it is a work which requires long time and a cloſe application; it is a work in which neither the moſt extenſive erudition, nor the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate underſtanding can enſure an author ſucceſs— In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other ſpecies of compoſition, judgment, genius, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are almoſt certain of a triumph—but here knowledge of the world is indiſpenſibly requiſite—An acquaintance with the manners, and with the paſſions is requiſite. — Nor are theſe ſufficient without an invention to ſtrike out variety; and a ſkill to produce effects, by a forcible diſplay of ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion — It is not the good ſenſe only of an audience which is addreſſed — but their feelings; they muſt be agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized while they are publicly inſtructed, and the Muſe, like other beauties, muſt be raviſhing to the general eye, before ſhe can be dear to the general heart.</p>
            <p>When therefore the difficulty attending a dramatic work is ſo conſiderable; when perhaps there is another conſiderable difficulty to get a play received by the ſtage, and another ſtill to find a capital company of performers to repreſent it, inſtead of wondering that the number of writers is ſo ſmall, we ſhould in reality wonder how it is ſo reſpectable. — But if we look ſtill farther, we ſhall be ſurprized that <hi>any</hi> author riſks his bark upon the dangerous ocean of the theatre — It is a melancholy truth, that the people who write moſt for the ſtage, are rather remarkable for their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity than their opulence. — On this account a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them is an eſſential misfortune. Yet a few private enemies can at all times fruſtrate their expectations. In vain an unfortunate man of letters may labour for many months with a laudable view of entertaining the town, and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own circumſtances; — and in vain he may exert his utmoſt efforts to merit the protection of an audience, if he has unhappily given one individual an offence. The moment his piece is talked of, a party is poſſibly formed to damn it; and many who would not join this party from malevolence, give it countenance, for the pleaſure, as it is called, <hi>of kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a riot in the playhouſe.</hi> — Thus the littleneſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal pique, and the levity of inconſiderate laughter, have the poet totally at their mercy. — The curtain riſes, and the ſtorm begins; nor can the generous interpoſition of nine tenths among the auditors preſerve the play from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is as much confuſion created by the deſire of <q>
                  <hi>go on, go on,</hi>  as by the cry, <hi>go off, go off.</hi>
               </q> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſturbs the repreſentation has a tendency to injure it;
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0670102900:17"/>
ſo that a performance exhibited during a ſtate of contention muſt deſpair of ſucceſs; — the ſupporters conſtantly interrupted have no opportunity of being entertained, and naturally enough, perhaps attribute the fault to the author; while the oppoſition deciſively pronouncing upon what is predetermined not to hear, kindly brands him with the epithet of an incorrigible, dance, and, not content with the injury done to his fortune, makes an equal attack upon his literary character.</p>
            <p>Such being the ſituation of dramatic genius in this country, let the public themſelves judge, whether an author has any mighty encouragement to write for the ſtage. — Perhaps the poet, treated in the manner now deſcribed, has no dependence but his talents; perhaps upon the ſucceſs of the very piece thus ſuppreſſed he built his chief eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in life, and founded every future proſpect of bringing up a growing family with reputation. — What muſt his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings then be, to find his hopes all blaſted in a ſingle hour — to find the very labour, poſſibly of years, deſtroyed in an inſtant, by the people for whoſe entertainment he laboured; and to ſee the bread not only wreſted from the hands of his unoffending little ones, but to ſee them even expoſed to the ſtill perſecuting reſentment of prejudice, for the imaginary offences of their father. — What muſt be his feelings — Yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear humanity to inquire — the anſwer will harrow up your boſom — Generoſity, turn away from the picture, it muſt deluge you with tears.—The ſcene of poetical diſtreſs however ſketched to the reader's imagination, thanks to the goodneſs of Providence, is far from being Mr. Kelly's ſituation; but it often has been, and often may be, the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a much worthier man.—Mr. Kelly is affluent beyond his merits—nay, beyond his utmoſt hopes, he poſſeſſes the riches of content in a very extenſive manner, and can ſit down to his humble repaſt with pleaſure, in the honeſt recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection that it is punctually paid for.</p>
            <p>The difficulties here pointed out, for dramatic genius to encounter, are difficulties to which every writer for the ſtage is conſtantly expoſed; but the danger becomes infinitely more formidable, if, in times of party feud, he renders himſelf in the leaſt diſagreeable to the popular ſide of the queſtion; the unreflecting virtue of numbers then, as in Mr. Kelly's caſe, will arm againſt him, and think it meritorious to condemn the production, that puniſhment may be inflicted upon the imputed delinquency of the man. — In times like the preſent therefore, what is a dramatic writer to do? — To hold his tongue, replies cold blooded prudence. — And what has the unfortunate man of letters committed, that he alone of all the community is to be denied the privilege of ſpeaking his ſentiments? Say, ye various ſons of ſcience, will you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0670102900:18"/>
to this deſpicable ſlavery of the mind? Are you, above the generality of mankind, diſtinguiſhed for your education and your underſtanding, to be refuſed an opinion, where an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is deemed the birth-right of your meaneſt fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Shall it be your glory to inculcate leſſons of generoſity and independence, and yet be your crime to practiſe theſe leſſons yourſelves? — Shall your writings breathe the nobleſt ſpirit of candour, and your lives be a round of the pooreſt diſſimulation? — Shall you think your country in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and yet be afraid to ſpeak a ſyllable for it's preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? — No, you will not tear the ſiner principles from your breaſts; you will not ſet an example of ſo abject a diſingenuity. — Whatever meets the approbation of your judgment, will be ſupported by the ſanction of your voice, and however you may meet with reproach, you will at leaſt be careful not to deſerve it. — When adminiſtration is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible, you will be too honeſt to combat in it's cauſe; but, at the ſame time you will not heſitate to condemn the errors of popularity. — You will be always animated by a real ſolicitude for the public, and be as careful to guard againſt the extravagance of it's over-zealous friends, as to provide againſt the machinations of it's moſt politic enemies. — Acting thus you may be poor, but you will ever be reſpectable. — Poſterity will do you juſtice, if you are even oppreſſed by your cotemporaries, and you will find ample reſources in the conſciouſneſs of your integrity, to compenſate for the ſevereſt diſappointments in your fortune.</p>
            <p>To conclude — If men of talents have an equal right of thinking with the reſt of their fellow-ſubjects, and if they are not precluded by the generally acknowledged ſuperiority of their underſtandings, from declaring their ſentiments upon ſubjects of national importance, the lovers of the drama muſt ſee that nothing can be ſo dangerous to the exiſtence of genius, as the introduction of political diſputes into the theatre. The party which condemns a writer of different principles on one day, may ſee a favourite author, ſacrificed the very next by their enemies in politics; and the violence may continue till there is ſcarcely an individual hardy enough to furniſh our managers with a piece. The ſtate of the ſtage is at preſent ſufficiently deplorable; and it's litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, inſtead of wanton oppoſition, calls loudly for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous hand of public encouragement. — Give it this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement therefore, ye wiſe, and ye worthy — reſcue your writers from the worſt of all tyrannies, and no longer form your minds by the ſentiments of thoſe, who are not allowed to poſſeſs any minds of their own.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>WELL but, my dear Caroline, tho' I grant you that Sir George Haſtings has his peculiarities, ſtill you muſt grant me that he has many very amiable qualities.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>I never denied Sir George's merit, Sir, but all his good qualities cannot conceal his unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able coxcombry; <q>his attention is conſtantly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in himſelf, and there is no enduring a man who fancies that every woman muſt at firſt ſight fall violently in love with him.</q>

                  <speaker>Miſs MONTAGU.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir John, there is no accounting for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, you know; — however, I cannot look upon Sir George in the very ridiculous light he appears to Miſs Dormer.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>No — why he is a narciſſus that continually makes love to his own ſhadow, and I can't bear the idea of a huſband, in whoſe affection I am likely to be every moment rival'd by the looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs MONTAGU.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay now, my dear, you are rather hard upon him. — Sir George may poſſibly be a little too fond of himſelf —</p>

                  <speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>But then he is attentive to every law of juſtice and generoſity.</p>

                  <p>Upon my word, Harriot, a very florid winding up of a period, and very proper for an elevated thought in a ſentimental Comedy; — but I tell you, I ſhould reliſh theſe encomiums on Sir George well enough, if he Was not ſo particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0670102900:36"/>
to my attention. — I really can't ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the imagination of vowing honour and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the object of my own ridicule, and it wou'd mortify my pride beyond conception, to ſee my huſband the conſtant jeſt of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear Caroline, don't be too difficult in your choice, nor entertain any romantic idea of finding a husband, all perfection. — The expectation of too much before marriage, frequently imbitters the union after; — and as the beſt men will have their little blemiſhes, we may farley number thoſe among the beſt, in whoſe characters we can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover nothing more than a few triſling peculiarities.</p>

                  <p>I ſee, Sir, you make a point of this affair.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir JOHN.</speaker>
                  <p>I wou'd not make a point of any thing, my dear, which I thought wou'd be in the leaſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to your happineſs: — but, really, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this propoſal in every reſpect, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the rank, the fortune, and what is above all, the merit of the man, I cannot but with that you wou'd give him a favourable reception; and this the more eſpecially, as I am convinced, if the match ſhould take place, that your fine ſenſe and ſweetneſs of temper, will eaſily mould your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to your wiſh, and quickly remove every trace of thoſe foibles, which, are at preſent the only reaſon of your objection.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs MONTAGU.</speaker>

epithet of Miſs—the men in general ſay that the ſureſt way of making a woman wretched is to indulge her inclinations—But pray, my dear, why is this liberty which Sir John allows you, of promoting your own happineſs, ſo very likely to make you miſerable.</p>

                  <p>Caroline, Caroline, this reſerve is ill ſuited both to the nature of our friendſhip and the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary frankneſs of your temper—yet notwithſtanding the ſecreſy you have hitherto ſo unkindly obſerv'd, I can eaſily ſee that Mr. Villars—What, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, Caroline?</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs MONTAGU.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, to do the young fellow juſtice, he is really very agreeable, and has ſomething in his manner that would do credit to a more eligible ſituation—but—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, Harriot, there's the misfortune—agreeable as he is in every reſpect, he is ſtill a total depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on my father, and thinks himſelf extremely happy that his talents have obtain'd him even a temporary eſtabliſhment in an opulent family.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs MONTAGU.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, my dear, Sir John is generous, and Mr. Villars is very uſeful to him in his literary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches; beſides, I am not a little pleas'd at the diſtinction with which he, as well as the Captain, conſtantly treats Mr. Villars.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't know how it is—Mr. Villars has a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of commanding reſpect from every body; he is humble without ſervility, and ſpirited—</p>

in not giving him a large fortune—however, if I have any ſkill in the buſineſs of the heart, Villars is to the full as uneaſy upon your account as you can poſſibly be on his—he is always contriving excuſes for converſing with you, yet when he does, he is in viſible confuſion; and it was only yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday evening, when I beg'd he wou'd put a letter for me into the poſt-office, that he ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd out, in the utmoſt perplexity, <q>I ſhall take particular care, Madam, to deliver it to Miſs Dormer.</q>

                  <p>If this be the caſe, Harriot, I muſt indeed behave with particular circumſpection to him; and yet, tho' I ſee the impoſſibility of ever being his, he has given me an inſuperable averſion to the reſt of his ſex.</p>

                  <p>Well but, George, there is one exceſs of which you yourſelf have been guilty; and I have known the time, when you took a bottle ſo freely, that you were generally made toaſt-maſter of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

                  <p>Yes, but I ſoon found out that drinking was deteſtable, and toaſting the greateſt of all abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>

                  <p>It was'nt her youth, however, that ſtruck me, but the ſobriety of her conduct, and her affection for my daughter; —ſhe was beſides a diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my firſt wife's—liv'd with us in the ſame houſe; and ſome how I lik'd her, becauſe having no fortune, it gave her but little expectation of a better huſband.</p>

                  <p>My dear Captain, life has misfortunes enough without our being induſtrious to encreaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them—when an accident therefore happens, we ſhou'd conſider that, bad as it may be, it might have been ſtill worſe; and inſtead of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly murmuring at the diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we ſhou'd thankfully acknowledge the goodneſs that did not plunge us into a deeper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of affliction.</p>

                  <p>Not ſo faſt—not quite ſo faſt, my dear Villars, I beg of you: —Miſs Willoughby certainly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a greater ſhare of my affection than any other woman in the world; and I don't know, if my father could be brought to approve of ſuch a match, that I ſhould find the leaſt diſinclination to marry her: — but as matters ſtand at preſent there's no likelihood of ſuch a circumſtance, and therefore I wou'dn't chooſe to diſoblige Sir John in ſo material a point, eſpecially as my wiſhes with regard to Miſs Willoughby may poſſibly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd without ſo conſiderable a ſacrifice.</p>

                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Why Miſs Willoughby knew all along of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with Miſs Montagu, and conſequently had no reaſon to ſuppoſe that my intentions cou'd be very matrimonial; beſides, ſhe let nobody into the ſecret of my addreſſes but her ridiculous ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, who is a miſerable compound of avarice and affectation: —indeed, to do the young lady juſtice, it was a conſiderable time before ſhe wou'd hear a ſyllable of a tender nature from me, on account of my connection with Miſs Montagu.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Why in the cuſtomary manner: — I talk'd a damn'd deal of nonſenſe with a very tragical tone and a very melancholy countenance — exclaim'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0670102900:52"/>
againſt the tyranny of fathers who wanted to force the inclinations of their children from deſpicable motives of intereſt—and curs'd the poor ſtars for giving her ſo much beauty, and making me ſo ſenſible of it:— then preſſing her tenderly by the hand, I uſually ran out of the room, as if in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent emotion, affecting to gulp down a torrent of tears, and left her own pity to be my advocate the moment ſhe recovered the uſe of her recollection.</p>

                  <speaker>VILLARS.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, perfectly; the women are inconceivably fond of the pathetic, and liſten to you with rapture if you talk about death or diſtraction—ſpring but the mine of their pity, you ſoon blow their hearts into a flame — and reap more ſervice from an hour of compleat ſubſtantial miſery than from a whole year of the moſt paſſionate adoration.</p>

                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Why faith, Villars, that's a very puzzling queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the whole; — notwithſtanding all my levity, you know I have the deepeſt reverence for my father, and he muſt not be diſoblig'd upon any account, — tho' to deal honeſtly with you, I have no mighty inclination to Miſs Montagu.</p>

                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Why I ſhou'd'nt like to be a raſcal there neither, —yet what can one do; — where a woman's weak enough to encourage the addreſſes of a man whom ſhe knows to be pre-engaged, ſhe gives him a kind
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0670102900:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of title to deceive her: — beſides, Villars, Miſs Willoughby has herſelf ſhewn a genius for dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in this affair which ſhou'd make a man of any ſenſe a little conſiderate.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't you recollect ſhe has deceiv'd her father thro' the whole tranſaction? and it is a maxim with me that the woman who can forget the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature, has half an inclination to forget the ſentiments of virtue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

Shall I meanly betray the poor girl who has generouſly thrown herſelf upon my humanity, and convince the world by ſuch a conduct that ſhe was right in refuſing me: —no, damn it—I ſcorn a littleneſs of that nature, and I muſt ſhew myſelf worthy of her affection, tho' her unfortunate pre-engagement wou'd not ſuffer me to obtain it. But how in the name of perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſhall I manage the matter? —A refuſal on my ſide neceſſarily incurs the general reſentment of the family, and the cenſure of the world into the bargain; — ſo that in all probability I ſhall not only have the honour of riſquing my life but my reputation, and this for the happineſs of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the woman I admire to the arms of my rival. —Really the proſpect is a very comfortable one. <stage>[Exit.]</stage>

                  <p>Yes, Caroline, a viſible reluctance. —'Tis true indeed there are a good many kind-hearted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who can ſtoop to fatter a fellow's vanity, even while he treats them with contempt; —but I am made of different materials, my dear, — I love to mortify the preſumption of thoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent puppies, who aſk my hand with as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity as if they aſk'd a pinch of ſnuff, and ſeem to ſay, <q>ſo child, I want to make you the upper ſervant of my family.</q>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0670102900:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has gone this length, there is no reſiſting the temptation. —As I told you before, Villars, ſhe knows I can't marry her, ſhe knows I am already engag'd, —and what the devil do you think ſhe wants with me—hey?</p>

                  <p>When I came here, inſtead of a willing victim to your wiſhes, I found Miſs Willougby in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt affliction, conſcious of her indſcretion in flying from her father, and ſhuddering with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of violence from you. — She ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me of her fears, and lamented, in the moſt pathetic terms, how greatly ſhe had been deceiv'd in the object of her affection. — She imagin'd an honourable union with you, wou'd have been the conſequence of her flight; and little ſuppoſed that the man ſhe lov'd wou'd make uſe of her partiality for himſelf to cover her with diſgrace. — Thus diſappointed, thus betray'd, ſhe aſk'd for my protection, ſhe receiv'd it — and now, Sir, (<hi>drawing</hi>) take your revenge.</p>

                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, I will take my revenge, but it ſhall be thus: (<hi>throwing down his ſword and ſhaking

                  <p>Indeed I cannot. — I only ſaw her into a coach; but I ſuppoſe ſhe is returned to her father's.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>No — ſhe is not — her father is but juſt gone — he came to me, as I ſuſpected, on the very firſt knowledge of her flight; and ſhew'd ſo deep a diſtreſs, that I cou'dn't perſevere in my deſign of ſeeming wholly ignorant of her elopement.</p>

                  <speaker>DORMER.</speaker>
                  <p>I therefore brought him here to give her back; and the poor man was actually in extaſies — but when he found ſhe was gone, he loſt all patince; and, naturally enough, imagining that ſhe was carry'd off by my contrivance, treated me with a freedom, which nothing but the conviction of my guilt could enable me to endure, even from the father of Miſs Willoughby.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I have been culpable — extremely culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble — but my preſent intention is to remove Mr. Willoughby's diſtreſs — not to defend the injury I offered him — and I can with truth affirm, that the principal part of my miſconduct in this affair, originally proceeded from the great veneration which I entertained for that very father, who now thinks me ſo profligate and unnatural.</p>

                  <p>I lov'd Miſs Willoughby, Sir, tenderly lov'd her, before you enter'd into any engagement about Miſs Montagu — But fearful of diſobliging you, I kept the circumſtance of my paſſion a ſecret, as I did not ſuppoſe you wou'd countenance a union, where there was ſo material a diſparity of ſituations.</p>

                  <p>At an early ſtage of infancy, ſome wandering miſcreants ſtole me from my friends, and carried me into a diſtant part of the country, where a woman, who call'd herſelf my mother, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon for a theft, fell ill of a fever, that put a period to her life — with her dying breath ſhe related this circumſtance, and wou'd have told more, but the laſt agonies taking away her utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, prevented the poſſibility of any farther declaration.</p>
