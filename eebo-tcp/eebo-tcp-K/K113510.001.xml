            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THESE Two Volumes are compoſed from the XIVth and XVth of my OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE. I had many ſolicitations from private friends, and a few wiſhes from perſons unknown delivered in the public prints, to commit to the preſs a part, in the form in which the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous volumes might hereafter make their appearance. I might have pleaded the imprudence of the attempt, at my time of life, of beginning ſo arduous an undertaking in my 71ſt year. I happily, till very lately, had ſcarcely any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the advanced ſeaſon. I plunged into the ſea of troubles, and with my papers in one hand, made my way through the waves with the other, and brought them ſecure to land. This, alas! is ſenile boaſting. I muſt ſubmit to the judgment of the public, and learn from thence how far I am to be cenſured for ſo grievous an offence againſt the maxim of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who fixes the decline of human abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the 49th year. I ought to ſhudder when I conſider
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0792500101:5"/>the wear and tare of twenty-two years; and I feel ſhocked at the remark of the elegant <hi>Delaney,</hi> who obſerves,
<q>that it is generally agreed among wiſe men, that few great attempts, at leſt in the learned way, have ever been wiſely undertaken and happily executed after that period!</q> I cannot defend the wiſdom: yet, from the good fortune of my life, I will attempt the execution.</p>
            <p>It will be formed upon the model of my INTRODUCTION to the ARCTIC ZOOLOGY, imitating, as far as my talents will admit, the great examples left by the diſciples of the LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEAN ſchool, and the ſolid writings of the liberal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative race of the <hi>hyperborean</hi> learned, fitted by cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to aſſiduous ſtudy, and to retain the immenſeneſs of their knowlege, when acquired. The Torrid Zone gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally enervates the body and mind. The divine particle melts away, and every idea is too often loſt in irreſiſtible indolence.</p>
            <p>Yet there are two writers, to whom I muſt own the higheſt obligations, who felt no degeneracy by the influence of climate. Their thoughts are as firm and collected as if they had been braced by the ſteady froſt of the north.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>James Rennel</hi> Eſquire, late Major of Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers and Surveyor General in <hi>Bengal.</hi> The effects of his
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0792500101:6"/>labors, more immediately applied to the national ſervice, have been productive of others, which have proved the brighteſt elucidations of a country, till after the year 1757, little more than the object of conqueſt, and now and then,— rarely indeed, of ſordid adventure. Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi>'s Map of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> or the <hi>Mogul</hi> Empire, and the attendant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir, are unparalleled convictions of the accuracy of the author in the ſtudy of geography, in which no rival dare diſpute the palm of merit. I cannot expreſs the obligations my preſent Work is under to his labors. I underſtand that there is another of the ſame nature, but far more extenſive— perhaps in the preſs—every ſucceſs attend the labors of his pen.</p>
            <q>
               <l>I pede fauſto,</l>
               <l>Grandia laturus meritorum praemia—</l>
            </q>
            <p>The other writer I allude to is the celebrated Sir WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM JONES. The ſubjects of that true genius were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored by APOLLO himſelf, being as ſublime and elegant as thoſe over which that deity peculiarly preſided. The SUN, whoſe character might melt away the powers of feeble Genii, ſerved only to exalt his ſtrength of mind, as its beams are feigned to give additional brilliancy to the diamond in its mine. The reader will not wonder that
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0792500101:7"/>I make him ſo nearly the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of this my labor. The various pen of my illuſtrious countryman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in every ſcience. <hi>Phoebus</hi> ſmiled on all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and he was ſaluted by the whole circle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on the deity, as <hi>Gallus</hi> is ſaid to have been of old: —A truer ſimile cannot be adduced.</p>
            <q>Utque vero PHOEBI Chorus ſurrexerit omnis!</q>
            <p>I muſt not be ſilent in reſpect to the labors of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other gentleman, who, notwithſtanding he never viſited <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> has written with uncommon ſucceſs on the wonderful mythology of the <hi>Hindoo</hi> religion, derived moſt happily the ſources of many of its myſteries, and traced their origins, nearly loſt in the miſts of fable, from the ſacred purity of HOLY WRIT. He has done the ſame by numbers of the abſtruſeſt antiquities of the works of art; and that with a depth of learning and perſpicuity rarely to be met with. But, alas! no CHOIR riſes to ſalute the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Thomas Maurice.</hi> This learned divine bends under the weight of <hi>honeſta pauperies.</hi> That ſtill voice which hurt-merit and conſcious modeſty cannot always ſuppreſs, is often drowned in the clamors of the undaunted throng, ſo as never to emerge into the notice of thoſe whoſe
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0792500101:8"/>peculiar duty it is to ſearch deeply into characters, be they in courts or choirs, and to put to flight the <hi>ignavum pecus,</hi> which are too frequently the peſts of both,
<q>
                  <l>Who, for their bellies ſake,</l>
                  <l>Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold.</l>
                  <l>Of other care they little reck'ning make,</l>
                  <l>Than how to ſcramble at the ſhearers feaſt,</l>
                  <l>And ſhove away the worthy bidden gueſt!</l>

Theſe ſoon loſe the uſe of ſome or other of their limbs, by their perſiſting in the moſt unnatural atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. They are the moſt ſqualid of the order. They leave the hair of their head to grow far below their rumps, and the beards to an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous buſhineſs.

               <item>Page 118. 1. 13.—<hi>M. de la Tour</hi> is the only hiſtorian who deſcribes <hi>Ranna Biddelura</hi> in ſuch exalted terms. Lieutenant <hi>Moor,</hi> in his <hi>Narrative,</hi> p. 51, mentions a place called <hi>Rana Bednore,</hi> which I preſume to be the ſame; yet he ſpeaks of it only 'as a market town of ſome importance and extent, with a fort, but not 'a ſtrong one.' It is impoſſible that in the ſhort interval between the time it was deſcribed by the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and that in which it was viſited by our honeſt ſoldier, that it could ſo ſuddenly decline from its magnificence as to ſuffer its uncommon ſplendor to paſs without any notice. The place is expreſſed in Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi>'s Map of <hi>Hindooſtan;</hi> and alſo in Mr. <hi>Moor</hi>'s, at the diſtance of about ninety miles to the north-eaſt of <hi>Bednore,</hi> in Lat, 14°40″, Eaſt Long. 76°.</item>

               <note place="margin">THE INDUS.</note> was called by the antients, <hi>Indus,</hi> a name retained by the moderns. It riſes from ten ſtreams ſpringing remote from each other, out of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> mountains, one of which originates in <hi>Caſhmere.</hi> The rivers of the <hi>Panjab,</hi> and thoſe which riſe from the weſt above <hi>Candahar</hi> and <hi>Cabul,</hi> are the great contributory ſtreams, but the parent one ſeems to be that which flows out of <hi>Caſhgar,</hi> in Lat. 37° 10′ N. The name <hi>Sind</hi> is native, and of great antiquity, and mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Arrian</hi> as the <hi>Indian</hi> appellative;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0792500101:18"/>the one writes it <hi>Sindus,</hi> the other <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>THE <hi>Indus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">PENINSULA OF INDIA.</note> or rather the ſtreams which fall into it from the eaſt, particularly the <hi>Ihylum</hi> or river of <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> and the <hi>Ganges</hi> near <hi>Latak,</hi> in Little <hi>Thibet,</hi> to the north of <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> approximate, and then run diverging till they reach the ſea, and peninſulate the mighty empire, ſo that they give the name to <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> of the Peninſula of <hi>India. India</hi> or <hi>Hindooſtan</hi> is not of vernacular derivation, antient as it is; the name <hi>Hind</hi> was given it by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who tranſmitted it to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and they formed from it the word <hi>India;</hi> for we are aſſured by the ſcientific linguiſt Mr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> that no ſuch word is to be found in the <hi>Sanſcrit</hi> Dictionary; for the aborigines of the country knew it by no other than that of <hi>Bharata</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rennel XX. and the attendant note.</note>. The diſcovery is new, but we have preſerved the antient name of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> given it by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and that of <hi>India</hi> by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who gave that of <hi>Hindoos</hi> to the aboriginal people of the country, and <hi>Stan</hi> a region.</p>
            <p>THIS vaſt peninſula was formerly divided into two parts, <hi>Hindooſtan</hi> Proper, which was bounded on the ſouth by the rivers <hi>Nerbudda</hi> and <hi>Soane,</hi> and the ſouthern borders of <hi>Bengal,</hi> and by the <hi>Barrampooter</hi> on the eaſt.</p>
            <p>THE other diviſion is the <hi>Deccan,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>ſouth,</hi> and under that meaning comprehends all the reſt of the penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, as far as Cape <hi>Comorin.</hi> This name and this diviſion ſeem at preſent ſcarcely known, except in the mention of the great <hi>Soubahſhip,</hi> poſſeſſed by <hi>Nizam al Muluck</hi> and his ſucceſſors.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0792500101:19"/>This is now greatly altered in its limits, and abridged in its extent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hindooſtan</hi> tends to a conoid form. The northern part ſpreads into a large irregular baſe. <hi>Hurdwar,</hi> the moſt north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern place in the province of <hi>Delhi,</hi> is nearly in Lat. 30°, Long. 78° 15′. Cape <hi>Comorin</hi> is the moſt ſouthern extremity, the point in Lat. 8°, Long. 77° 36′ 50″ E. The length therefore of this country is thirteen hundred and eighty three <hi>Britiſh</hi> miles; the breadth at the baſe from <hi>Tatta,</hi> in the <hi>Delta</hi> of the <hi>Indus,</hi> to <hi>Silhet,</hi> on the eaſtern extremity of <hi>Bengal,</hi> is thirteen hundred and ninety.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary to be obſerved, that <hi>India</hi> is bounded on the north by a range of moſt lofty mountains, rocky, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently precipitous and inacceſſible. Theſe were the <hi>Haemodus</hi> and <hi>Paropamiſus</hi> of the antients; and thoſe which are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the <hi>Indus</hi> forcing its way through the chain, are called the <hi>Imaus</hi> or the ſnowy; but the flatterers of <hi>Alexander</hi> in compliment to him, beſtowed on the weſtern part of that out-let the name of <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> as if, ſays <hi>Arrian (Exped.

               </head>
               <p>THE earlieſt notice we have of commerce with this great empire, was in the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Ch. 37, where we find mention of the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> carrying on a trade with <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">PATRIARCHAL.</note> in ſpices, balm, and myrrh; the two laſt might have been produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or of <hi>Gilead,</hi> but the ſpices were conſined to <hi>India.</hi> They travelled at that time in caravans, and carried
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0792500101:20"/>their goods on the backs of camels in the very manner that their deſcendants the <hi>Arabs</hi> continue to do from that period. They took the ſame route as the patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and delivered their articles of luxury at the proud <hi>Memphis.</hi> As ſoon as they became a naval people, much of the commerce of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as well as of <hi>India,</hi> was conveyed to <hi>Muza</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">ARRIAN. Periplus, p. 152.</note>, a port not remote from the modern <hi>Mocha,</hi> and from thence ſhipped to <hi>Berenice</hi> or to <hi>Myos hormos,</hi> and placed on the backs of camels, conveyed to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> markets. But in reſpect to the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> who had met with <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his brethren, it is highly probable, that it was prior to the time of their knowlege of navigation. They had therefore performed the whole jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to and from <hi>India</hi> by land. On their return they increaſed their caravan by the addition of the myrrh and balm, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of their own country, or of <hi>Gilead;</hi> which they had left not long before they met with the patriarchs at <hi>Dotham,</hi> a place in the middle of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> not far to the weſt of the ſea of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias.</hi> They then proceeded on their journey to <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the addition of another article of commerce, a ſlave, in the perſon of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whom they had juſt purchaſed from his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious brethren.</p>
               <p>THIS communication with <hi>India</hi> was carried on for a great length of time. To uſe the authority of HOLY WRIT, our ſafeſt guide on all occaſions, we find that SOLOMON gave it every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0792500101:21"/>I SHALL now mention the route for which the ancients were indebted to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> hero, who, after paſſing the <hi>paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pamiſan Caucaſus,</hi> founded a city on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the <hi>Ghergiſtan</hi> mountains, or <hi>Hindoo Kho,</hi> or the <hi>Indian Caucaſus,</hi> and called it <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in honor of himſelf.
<note place="margin">ALEXANDRIA.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> paſſed this way in his purſuit of <hi>Beſſus,</hi> and returned by the ſame road on his invaſion of <hi>India.</hi> It is probable, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> was founded on the firſt expedition, in order to ſecure his return into a country, the conqueſt of which he had ſo much at heart. According to Mr. <hi>Rennel,</hi> it appears to have been in Lat. 34°, oppoſite to the modern <hi>Bamian,</hi> which ſtands on the north-weſt ſide of <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> Here, according to <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> lib. vii. c. 3. he left ſeven thouſand old <hi>Macedonian</hi> ſoldiers, and a number worn out in the ſervice. <hi>Arrian,</hi> I. p. 230, ſays that he appointed <hi>Proexes,</hi> a noble <hi>Perſian,</hi> Governor, and <hi>Niloxenus,</hi> Commiſſary of the army. <hi>Alexandria</hi> continued long an <hi>emporium</hi> of the goods of <hi>India,</hi> the termination of the commercial views of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> till it was ſuperſeded by the riſe of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and <hi>Cabul.</hi> It ſeems to have had to it two roads; the one direct, and the ſame with the courſe taken by <hi>Alexander</hi> in his way from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea to his purſuit of <hi>Beſſus</hi> and his <hi>Indian</hi> conqueſt, through <hi>Aria,</hi> the modern <hi>Herat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">HERAT.</note> which was, till the latter ages, a place of great ſtrength and great commercial note. In courſe of ages, it ſuffered all the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which the cities of the eaſt are peculiarly incident; but it often emerged. <hi>Abdulkurreem</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A noble Caſhmerian who attended Kouli Khan on his return from India. See p. 24 of his Memoirs.</note> ſaw it in 1740, on his return, in a moſt diſtreſsful ſtate: the very ground floors of the houſes were ploughed up, and ſown with grain; but he ſpeaks
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0792500101:22"/>of the magnificent ruins, which ſhewed its former ſituation. The country was uncommonly rich, but the whole road from <hi>Candahar</hi> to this city, was a ſcene of deſolation, marked by the march of <hi>Kouli Khan</hi> on his return from <hi>India.</hi> From <hi>Herat</hi> the ancients directed their courſe to the ſouthern part of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea. This journey muſt have been performed by caravans of camels or horſes, as the road was deſtitute of navigable rivers. The route touched on the ſhore where <hi>Aſtrabad</hi> now ſtands, which, perhaps, was the port.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond way, and which was much frequented, was towards the north-weſt. The merchants went by <hi>Champan Drapſica,</hi> the modern <hi>Damian, Bactra,</hi> now called <hi>Zariaſpa, Nautica</hi> the modern <hi>Nekebad,</hi> and from that town by a ſhort ſtage to <hi>Maracunda</hi> or <hi>Samarcand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SAMARCAND.</note> ſeated in a moſt beautiful valley. All theſe cities roſe, and were ſupported by the paſſage of the caravans. As to <hi>Samarcand,</hi> it had long been a vaſt city, known by the name of <hi>Maracunda.</hi> It was garriſoned by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, after the capture (at <hi>Nautica</hi>) of <hi>Beſſus</hi> the murderer of <hi>Darius.</hi> The <hi>Scythians</hi> laid ſiege to it, but it was relieved by the <hi>Macedonian</hi> hero. It is ſaid to have been, even then, a city of vaſt opulence, ſtrength, and ſplendor.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Samarcand</hi> the articles of commerce were conveyed to the <hi>Oxus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">THE OXUS.</note> the modern <hi>Amu,</hi> which runs at no great diſtance to the ſouth. That famous river riſes far to the ſouth-eaſt, in the <hi>Caucaſan</hi> chain. It becomes navigable for barks at <hi>Termed,</hi> in Lat. 37° 30′ N. long before it comes near <hi>Samarcand;</hi> it is ſingular, that ſo diſtant a route ſhould be purſued before the commodities were embarked. In the days of <hi>El Edriſi,</hi> or the <hi>Nubian</hi> Geographer (p. 138) we find that it was frequented on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0792500101:23"/>that account; the Geographer mentions <hi>Termed</hi> among other ſtations near that great river. When the goods were ſhipped from <hi>Samarcand,</hi> they fell down the ſtream, which, in the time of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> paſſed through a marſhy tract, the <hi>paludes excipientes araxem,</hi> now the <hi>Aral</hi> lake, out of which it flowed, and, going ſouth-weſt, fell into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea in the bay of <hi>Balchan.</hi> This paſſage has been deſtroyed above two centuries ago, and its ancient channel is ſcarcely to be traced. Maſter <hi>Anthonie Jenkinſon,</hi> a moſt authentic traveller, gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account of the cauſe, in his travels into thoſe parts in 1558, as related by <hi>Purchas,</hi> (ſee p. 236):
<q>The water that ſerueth all that countrey, is drawne by ditches out of the river <hi>Oxus</hi> vnto the great deſtruction of the ſaid river, for which cauſe, it falleth not into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, as it hath done in times paſt, and in ſhort time all that land is like to be deſtroyed and to become a wilderneſſe for want of water, when the river of <hi>Oxus</hi> ſhall faile.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I WILL now briefly enter on ſome other ways pointed out by the ancients as commercial routes into <hi>India.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">OTHER ROUTES.</note> One is that mentioned by <hi>Pliny,</hi> (lib. vii. c. 17.) who probably ſpeaks on good authority; his account is founded on intelligence delivered down by <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he was purſuing the <hi>mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datic</hi> war. It was then certainly known, that it was but ſeven days journey out of <hi>India</hi> to the <hi>Bactryan</hi> country, even to the river <hi>Icarus,</hi> which runs into the <hi>Oxus,</hi> by means of which, the <hi>Indian</hi> commerce may be tranſported by the channel of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, and again by the river <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the modern <hi>Kur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CASPIAN SEA.</note> on the weſtern ſide as far as <hi>Phaſis,</hi> the <hi>Rione</hi> or modern <hi>Faſz,</hi> a large and navigable river, which falls into the head of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0792500101:24"/>
                  <hi>Euxine</hi> ſea, and appears to me a communication of great practicability.</p>
               <p>I MAY alſo mention <hi>Batnae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BATNAE.</note> a large commercial city, built, (according to <hi>Ammianus,</hi> lib. xiv. c. 3.) not remote from the <hi>Euphrates</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> by the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> It was filled with rich merchants; an annual fair was held there in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and it was then the reſort of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people, for the ſake of the commodities brought from <hi>India,</hi> and even <hi>Seres</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> and various other places, both by land and water; the laſt, by the channel of the <hi>Perſian</hi> gulph, and ſo up the <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Seres</hi> reminds me of the laſt communication I ſhall mention,
<note place="margin">THE SERES.</note> which was to the north, leading to the diſtant country of <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Chineſe</hi> merchants deſcended from their country, and leaving the head of the deſert of <hi>Gobi</hi> to the weſt, reached little <hi>Bucharia,</hi> and got the conveniency of the river <hi>Ilak</hi> for part of their journey.</p>

The river <hi>Sir,</hi> the old <hi>Iaxartes,</hi> is not far to the weſt of <hi>Caſhgar,</hi> and might, by its falling into lake <hi>Aral,</hi> be an ancient channel of communication with the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea. This city was the rendezvous, even in early times, of the merchants trading with the country to the north and to the ſouth. This, I dare ſuppoſe, was the

               <p>THE <hi>Seres,</hi> above ſpoken of, were the inhabitants of the north of <hi>China,</hi> remarkable for their ſilk, which the ancients believed was combed from the leaves of trees, and, when ſteeped in water, was corded and ſpun, and after their manner wove into a web.

                  <hi>Cabul</hi> is ſeated in Lat. 34° 36′ N. Long. 68° 58′ E.
<note place="margin">CABUL.</note> at the foot of the <hi>Indian Caucaſus,</hi> and in ſo happy a climate, as to produce the fruits of both the temperate and torrid zones, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is bordered by mountains capped with eternal ſnow. The <hi>Indian</hi> hiſtorians ſpeak of it in the moſt rapturous terms. It ſtands on the river <hi>Kameh,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Indus</hi> at <hi>Attock,</hi> but poſſibly is interrupted by rapids, as it is only navigable by rafts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cabul</hi> is the reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Candahar,</hi> and the preſent capital. The <hi>Nubian</hi> Geographer (p. 66.) ſpeaks of <hi>Cabul</hi> as a noble city; that its mountains abounded with the ſineſt aromatic woods, <hi>Neregil</hi> and <hi>Myrobalans;</hi> the firſt may be <hi>Nellila Phylanthus emblica;</hi> the others the <hi>Spondias purpurea,</hi> &amp;c. All the <hi>Myrobalans</hi> had once a name in our ſhops as gentle purgatives; among other purpoſes they are uſed in the tanning buſineſs.</p>
               <p>OF late days, <hi>Cabul</hi> has been noted for its vaſt fairs of horſes and cattle; the firſt brought there by the <hi>Uſhec Tartars.</hi> Slaves are alſo a conſiderable article of commerce.

They colonized <hi>Caffa</hi> with their own countrymen, and gained prodigious wealth during the time they were in poſſeſſion.

                  <hi>Anthonie Jenkinſon (Purchas,</hi> iii. 241.) gives a very curious account of the ſtate of <hi>Bochara</hi> and its commerce, as it was in the year 1558. This has been uninterruptedly continued from the earlieſt time to the preſent, for the northern parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> have their wants and luxuries to ſupply even from <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China.</hi> The diſcovery of the paſſage by the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> gave a great check to this inland commerce. No more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities were conveyed that way to the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> yet ſtill the trade is very conſiderable to the places I mentioned, and even to the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> empire. <hi>Catherine</hi> has, as yet, no ſhare in <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> no <hi>Indian</hi> fleets; her ſplendid courts, and all the luxuries of her vaſt cities are ſupplied either from <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> or from the other <hi>Caſpian</hi> ports; <hi>Aſtrakan</hi> is the great <hi>Ruſſian</hi> ſtaple of the <hi>Indian</hi> commerce. <hi>Gurjef</hi> and <hi>Kiſlar</hi> are the ſame. <hi>Perſia</hi> has its <hi>Derbend, Niezabad, Baku,</hi> and others. The <hi>Tartars</hi> have their bay of <hi>Balchan</hi> and <hi>Manguſhlak,</hi> through which, <hi>Bochara</hi> ſtill pours its <hi>Indian</hi> articles of commerce. It is foreign to the plan of <hi>out-line</hi> to enter into <hi>minutiae.</hi> I muſt therefore refer to the ſecond Volume of my friend the Reverend <hi>Wm. Coxe</hi>'s valuable Travels. The 4th Chapter will ſatisfy the moſt ardent curioſity.</p>
               <p>In reſpect to the antient <hi>Ruſſian</hi> commerce with theſe diſtant parts,
<note place="margin">RUSSIAN COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERCE.</note> I ſhall conclude the ſubject with obſerving, that after the various commodities of <hi>India</hi> had arrived through the channel of the <hi>Oxus</hi> into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, they were ſhipped for the <hi>Volga,</hi> the <hi>Rha</hi> of the antients. That river was ſo little known to the antients, that they have not left us the name of a ſingle place in its whole courſe. The merchants aſcended that great river. After navigating it a very conſiderable way they entered
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0792500101:30"/>the <hi>Kama,</hi> and arrived through the <hi>Kokra</hi> at <hi>Tcherdyn,</hi> ſeated in Lat. 60° 25′ North, in thoſe early times a mighty <hi>emporium.</hi> From thence the ſeveral eaſtern articles of commerce were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over all the <hi>arctic</hi> regions. The <hi>Nortmans</hi> and the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> people of the <hi>Baltic,</hi> had great intercourſe with them through the <hi>Nova,</hi> and <hi>Ladoga,</hi> another vaſt <hi>emporium,</hi> ſeated on the lake of the ſame name. As a proof of the antiquity of its commerce, coins of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> have been found in the antient burying places, evidences that the people of the eaſt and of the weſt had met there to ſupply their ſeveral wants; even at <hi>Tcherdyn,</hi> coins of the <hi>Arabian Caliphs</hi> have been diſcovered. Notwithſtanding the immenſe wealth of both <hi>Tcherdyn</hi> and <hi>Ladoga,</hi> ſcarcely a trace is to be ſeen of thoſe great <hi>emporia.</hi> The commerce of the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended even within the <hi>artic</hi> circle. The <hi>Beormas,</hi> the people of the old <hi>Permia,</hi> aſcended the <hi>Petzora</hi> with their furs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed them for the products of the torrid zones, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down that northern river diſperſed them over all their chilly regions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE conqueror took a north-eaſtern courſe, and paſſed by the tract of the modern towns of <hi>Killaut, Tazee, Meerout, Jom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood,</hi> and <hi>Gundermouk.</hi> He croſſed ſeveral rivers in his way, ſuch as the <hi>Cophenes,</hi> or <hi>Cow river,</hi> or <hi>Nagaz,</hi> and the <hi>Choe,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Guraeus,</hi> or modern <hi>Kameh.</hi> On the upper part of the <hi>Cophenes,</hi> which is called <hi>Dilen,</hi> ſtood <hi>Ghizni,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">GHIZNI.</note> once the capital of a mighty empire of the ſame name, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the tract lying between the <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Parthia,</hi> to the ſouth of the <hi>Oxus,</hi> and part of the antient <hi>Bactria.</hi> The city is now a heap of ruins, and ſcarcely mentioned in hiſtory. Its emperor <hi>Mahmood</hi> I. ſurnamed <hi>Ghizni,</hi> firſt invaded <hi>India</hi> in the year 1000; his firſt conqueſts extends only to <hi>Moultan.</hi> He in 1024 conquered the kingdom of <hi>Guzerat;</hi> at that time all <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooſtan</hi> was inhabited by the aborigines. With true <hi>Mahometan</hi> zeal he exerciſed all ſorts of barbarities againſt the <hi>Hindoos;</hi> and in order if poſſible to exterminate their religion, levelled with the ground their favorite Pagoda <hi>Sumnaut,</hi> and every other object of their worſhip. The <hi>Ghiznian</hi> empire continued 207 years. <hi>Mahomed</hi> began his reign in 977, and it became extinct in 1184.</p>
               <p>THE city of <hi>Attock</hi> ſtands oppoſite to the junction of the <hi>Kameh</hi> with the <hi>Indus.</hi> In the diſtrict of <hi>Bijore,</hi> not remote from hence, ſtood the <hi>Aornos Petra,</hi> and inacceſſible mountain,

Here <hi>Alexander</hi> croſſed the <hi>Indus</hi> on a bridge of boats, which his favorite <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> had ſome time before been ſent to prepare. In 1398 the famous <hi>Timur Beg,</hi> or <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> paſſed this river on one of the ſame kind. In our days <hi>Kouli
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0792500101:33"/>Khan</hi> (who may complete the ſanguinary triumvirate) croſſed the <hi>Indus</hi> at <hi>Attock</hi> in the ſame manner.

<note place="margin">PANJAB.</note> got clear of the mountains, and arrived in the rich plains of <hi>Panjab,</hi> or the <hi>Five Rivers,</hi> each immortalized by being a great ſcene of action of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> hero. The <hi>Hydaſpes,</hi> the modern <hi>Behut,</hi> or <hi>Chelum;</hi> the <hi>Aceſines</hi> or <hi>Jenaub,</hi> or <hi>Cheenaub,</hi> and the <hi>Hydraotes,</hi> or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Rauvee;</hi> all which, after a long courſe, unite in one chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which retains the name of <hi>Cheenaub,</hi> and after the junction, paſſes through the country of the <hi>Oxydracae,</hi> beneath the north ſide of <hi>Moultan,</hi> and at the diſtance of about twenty miles from that city, falls into the <hi>Indus</hi> about two hundred miles below <hi>Attock,</hi> in magnitude equal to the <hi>Indus</hi> itſelf.</p>

A nameleſs city, as Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi> ſtyles it, was to be found higher up the river, on the oppoſite ſide. This deſerved to have been immortalized, as having been the place where that hero endangered his life by one of the raſh actions he was very ſubject to fall into.
<note place="margin">ALEXANDER WOUNDED.</note> He leaped into the city, was beſet by enemies, and received a deſperate wound in his ſide by an arrow, which had transfixed his breaſtplate. He fainted, but recovered the moment he felt an <hi>Indian</hi> going to ſtrip him, and drawing a dagger pierced his aſſailant to the heart. I leave the reader to conſult <hi>Arrian, Exped. Alex.</hi> i. 396, about the event; and Mr. <hi>Rennel,</hi> p. 128, as to reaſons for fixing the ſite of the momentous affair in the place he does, about ten miles above the conflux of the two rivers.</p>
               <p>GOLD is found in ſome of the rivers of <hi>Panjab.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">GOLD.</note> In reſpect to gold, we are informed by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> THALIA, c. 95, that the <hi>Indians</hi> paid their tribute to <hi>Darius</hi> in that pretious metal; and tells us, that it is procured out of the rivers, and alſo dug out of the earth, and ſmelted by them into ingots before they make with it their donative. One of the epithets the Poets beſtow on the <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> is <hi>Aurifer,</hi> poſſibly as being peculiarly rich in gold. <hi>Herodotus, Thalia,</hi> c. 102, relates, and ſeems to credit, the ſtrange ſtory of its particles being thrown up with the ſand of the vaſt deſert, probably that of <hi>Regiſtan,</hi> by ants as big as foxes, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> went with three camels to collect the grains which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0792500101:35"/>they found in the hillocks. As ſoon as they had filled their bags, they returned with all poſſible expedition to avoid the fury of the ants, which purſued them with incredible ſwiftneſs. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the hiſtorian had heard of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous neſts of the <hi>Termites,</hi> or <hi>white Ants,</hi> which his informants thought proper to ſtock with moſt monſtrous inhabitants.</p>
               <p>ON the banks of the <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> was fought the deciſive battle between <hi>Alexander</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> monarch <hi>Porus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BATTLE WITH PORUS.</note> both equal in valour; but the former, by his great ſuperiority in the art of war, obtained a complete victory with a handful of men. <hi>Porus</hi> employed not fewer than two hundred elephants, which, terrific as they might have been to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> horſes, were, with their garriſoned towers, totally deſtroyed by the victorious army.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT reſiſt the introduction into this place of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing curious anecdotes of the two famous Monarchs,
<note place="margin">PERSIAN HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY OF.</note>, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me by Major <hi>Ouſeley,</hi> the ingenious author of the <hi>Perſian</hi> miſcellanies.

The firſt enumerates the various troops of <hi>Perſia, Greece,</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> and the camel loads of preſents which <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Keid,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince. <hi>Nezami,</hi> in his <hi>Skander Nameh,</hi> or Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſays, that forty elephants were loaden with the various productions of the country, among which ſeveral carried <hi>Indian</hi> ſteel. <hi>Porus</hi> is mentioned under the name of <hi>Four.</hi> The poet adds, he brought two thouſand elephants into the field; which, by a contrivance of <hi>Ariſtotle (Alexander</hi>'s Secretary) were completely routed, and <hi>Four</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0792500101:36"/>killed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who found in his caſtle of <hi>Canooge</hi> immenſe treaſures!</p>
               <p>ON the banks of this river,
<note place="margin">NICOEA, AND BUCEPHALA.</note> oppoſite to each other, he built, on the bloody ſcene, two cities, <hi>Nicoea</hi> and <hi>Bucephala. Nicoea</hi> ſo named from the victory, the laſt in honor of his celebrated horſe, which died of old age at the time of this action. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> gratefully paid it the higheſt funeral honors, erected a magnificent ſepulchre, and called the city after its name.</p>
               <p>I SHALL not trace the ſieges, battles, and ſlaughters of this ambitious character; of his marches and his paſſages over the rivers that form this part of the <hi>Panjab,</hi> but leave my readers to conſult his original hiſtorians, <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curtius.</hi> It is very certain the hero did not, amidſt his deeds of arms, neglect the ſtudy of natural hiſtory. It is well known that he cauſed every ſpecies, objects of that ſcience, to be collected for the uſe of his Tutor <hi>Ariſtotle. Q. Curtius</hi> relates ſome few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the <hi>zoology</hi> of the neighborhood. He met here with the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0792500101:37"/>the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> cubit is little more than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> foot and a half, we may give full credit to his having ſeen a ſerpent of the length he gives, or one of twenty-four feet. The antients are often abuſed for their credulity: but let me remark, that incredulity is more frequently the offspring of ignorance than the former! At this time inſtances may be adduced of ſpecies from twenty to thirty-ſix feet in length, in <hi>Hindooſtan, Ceylon, Java,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other iſlands. <hi>Bontius,</hi> p. 76. a moſt reſpectable writer, bears witneſs to the exiſtence of ſome of thirty-ſix feet being found in <hi>Java.</hi>

He committed to the care of certain officers the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the timber, and floating it down the river to the place he had appointed for the rendezvous of the veſſels, which he had uſed in his expeditions up the other rivers. At this place, which was between the forks of the <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Aceſines,</hi> he founded another <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ANOTHER ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDRIA.</note> and there formed his docks and ſhip yard. He built ſeveral new ſhips, rebuilt and repaired others, and with a fleet which conſiſted of eighty <hi>Triremes,</hi> or ſhips with three banks of oars, and with leſſer veſſels, probably collected from the ſeveral rivers of the country, in all amounting to two thouſand of different kinds, he fell down the <hi>Hydaſpes.</hi> On his arrival at the junction of that river with the <hi>Aceſines</hi> (which preſerves its name till it is loſt in the greater river) his navy underwent the utmoſt danger by the violent colliſion of the two waters. Several
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0792500101:38"/>of his ſhips were daſhed to pieces, and himſelf, and his admiral <hi>Nearchus,</hi> with difficulty eſcaped. The ſides and channel are filled with rocks, and <hi>Alexander,</hi> through ignorance of the climate of <hi>India,</hi> undertook his expedition in the rainy ſeaſon, which, beſides the ſwelling of the rivers (which impeded his march) made dreadful havoke among his troops by the diſeaſes of the country.</p>
               <p>THE other two rivers, which complete the <hi>Panjab,</hi> are the <hi>Beyah,</hi> once the <hi>Beypaſha,</hi> and the <hi>Hyphaſis</hi> of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The fifth and laſt is the <hi>Setlege</hi> or <hi>Suttuluz,</hi> the <hi>Zaradruz</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and <hi>Heſudrus</hi> of <hi>Pliny.</hi> Theſe riſe in the mountains that divide <hi>Thibet</hi> from <hi>India,</hi> and unite near <hi>Firoſepour.</hi> Soon after which they divide, and inſulate a pretty conſiderable tract into ſeveral iſlands; then re-unite, and, turning ſoutherly, fall into the <hi>Indus</hi> fifty-three miles below the mouth of the <hi>Chenaub,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi>'s great map. Between the inſulated part and the <hi>Hydraotes,</hi> was the ſeat of the <hi>Malli</hi> and the <hi>Catheri,</hi> objects of the deſtructive ambition of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who, in his expedition againſt thoſe people, ſeemed more intent on ſlaughter than uſeful conqueſt. It was on the banks of the <hi>Hyphaſis,</hi> ſays <hi>Quintius Curtius,</hi> that the hero joined his forces with thoſe of <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> after each had performed ſome bloody exploit. Here he concluded his expedition; and after the diſplay of his vanity, by erecting twelve altars near the junction of the <hi>Hyphaſis</hi> and <hi>Heſudrus,</hi> commenced his voyage down the <hi>Indus.</hi> The altars were equal in height to the loftieſt towers of war. On theſe he performed ſacriſices after the manner of his country. He then entertained the <hi>Indians</hi> with athletic and equeſtrian games, and concluded with inveſting the vanquiſhed <hi>Porus</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0792500101:39"/>with the ſovereignty of the whole country, as far as the <hi>Hyphaſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DURING his ſtay in theſe parts, he founded another <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> between the forks of the <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Aceſines.</hi> The modern name of the place ſeems, by Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi>'s map, to be <hi>Veh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT does not appear that ever he ſaw the <hi>Heſudrus,</hi> which, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> was a diſcovery of <hi>Seleucus Nicator,</hi> one of his ableſt officers, and his ſucceſſor in part of his dominions, and particularly of thoſe between the <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Indus:</hi> He ſeems to have ſucceeded alſo to the ambition of his maſter, for he meditated the conqueſt of <hi>India,</hi> or at leſt of re-conquering thoſe provinces beyond the <hi>Indus</hi> ſubdued by <hi>Alexander,</hi> but which, ſoon after his retreat, were recovered by <hi>Sandracotta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SANDRACOTTA.</note> an <hi>Indian</hi> of mean birth, but who, by his abilities, had rendered himſelf maſter of all <hi>India. Seleucus</hi> found this new monarch ſo very powerful, that he did not venture to attack him. He entered into a treaty with him, and agreed to retire, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>Sandracotta</hi> would ſupply him with five hundred ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; and thus covered his diſgrace with a ſpecious pretence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> began his voyage down the <hi>Indus</hi> about the end of the month of <hi>October,</hi> and was nine months in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion; not from the difficulty of navigation, for it might have been performed in a very ſhort time, but from his ambitious rage of conqueſt and ſlaughter on each ſide of the river. His army marched, divided in two parts, on the eaſtern and weſtern banks, ready to execute his orders, attended by his vaſt fleet.</p>
               <p>ONE motive to this voyage was a ſuſpicion <hi>Alexander</hi> had entertained, that he had found out the head of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0792500101:40"/>that this was no other than the celebrated river of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw in it crocodiles and beans, the <hi>Nymphoea Nelumbo</hi> of <hi>Linnaeus,</hi> ſimilar to thoſe of that kingdom. <hi>Arrian</hi> adds, that <hi>Alexander</hi> had even written to his mother an account of his diſcovery.</p>
               <p>IN our way down the ſtream, we find among the <hi>Sogdi,</hi> another <hi>Alexandria,</hi> founded on the ſite of the royal reſidence of their monarch, the modern <hi>Bekhor</hi> or <hi>Bakhor,</hi> in Lat. 27° 12″.</p>

               <p>THE mention of this, occaſions me to return to the concluſion of the expedition of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> hero. When he reached <hi>Pattala,</hi> he found the city deſerted: the fame of his barbarity had induced the prince, who had before ſubmitted, to retire with all his ſubjects. <hi>Alexander,</hi> finding the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling the place, ſent out light troops, who made ſome of the late inhabitants priſoners. Thoſe he treated with the utmoſt kindneſs, diſmiſſed them, and promiſed them protection, if they could induce their fellow-citizens to return. He ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his deſign; he formed a haven, and made docks, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0792500101:43"/>order to refit his fleet; which, being accompliſhed, he ſailed down into the ocean. The dangers which might occur in an unknown ſea, and the preſſing inſtances made by his friends, induced him to return. He landed his forces, and took the rout towards <hi>Gedroſia,</hi> and at length arrived at the city of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> with the remains of his faithful army, reduced by the toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome march, by famine, peſtilence, and every calamity which his phrenetic ambition had involved it in.</p>
               <p>HE had committed the care of his fleet to <hi>Nearchus,</hi> a man of firſt rate abilities, who engaged to conduct it through the ocean to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulph and the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> He performed his engagement, after many difficulties. When he had arrived at <hi>Harmozia,</hi> the modern <hi>Ormus,</hi> he heard that his maſter was not remote. He landed, with a few of his companions, and in five days reached the army, but ſo ſqualid and miſerable in their aſpect, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhocked at their appearance, took <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> aſide, and aſked, Whether he had not loſt his fleet? On being aſſured of its ſafety, he gave way to the moſt unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed joy, and crowned both him and <hi>Leonnatus</hi> with golden crowns; <hi>Nearchus</hi> for having preſerved the fleet, <hi>Leonnatus</hi> for a victory obtained over the <hi>Oritae;</hi> and the whole army ſaluted the former with flowers and garlands ſcattered over their celebrated admiral

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0792500101:44"/>greatly have exaggerated the preparations; they make her army conſiſt of three millions of foot, and two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, and a hundred thouſand chariots, and multitudes of ſhips, ready framed, and carried in pieces by land, to be put together in order to croſs the <hi>Indus.</hi> I ſuſpect that theſe veſſels were no more than ſo many coracles, or <hi>vitilia navigia,</hi> made of bamboos, like thoſe uſed by <hi>Ayder Alli</hi> in our days, on the waters of <hi>Malabar.</hi> In order to ſupply her wants of real elephants, ſhe cauſed a multitude of fictitious ones to be made, out of the ſkins of three hundred thouſand black oxen, which were placed on camels backs, guided by a man within this ſtrange machine.

                  <hi>Stabrobates,</hi> king of <hi>India,</hi> received advice of her preparations, and, by a prudent embaſſy, endeavoured to divert her from her intentions. The Queen rejected his remonſtrances, croſſed the river, and defeated the fleet of the <hi>Indian</hi> monarch; that perhaps was not difficult, notwithſtanding it conſiſted of four thouſand boats; but as they were formed only of the bamboo cane, they never could reſiſt the ſhock of timber ſhips. The victory proved fatal to her; ſhe ſucceeded in croſſing the river, but was deceived by the pretended flight of <hi>Stabrobates;</hi> ſhe purſued, and overtook him; the battle was fought: The <hi>Indian</hi> monarch diſcovered the fictitious elephants, and <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> was totally defeated. She re-paſſed the river with precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; ſhe loſt great part of her troops, and returned covered with ſhame into her own country. So many fabulous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attend this expedition, that we may well doubt the veracity of the hiſtorian, and poſſibly of the very exiſtence of the heroine.

               <p>I SHALL now give a ſhort topographical review of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated river, from the ocean to its moſt remote part, and alſo of the rivers which ſwell its ſtream. That which receives this mighty river is the <hi>Mare Erythroeum,</hi> or modern <hi>Arabian</hi> ſea. I have given ſome account of the <hi>Delta;</hi> let me add that it is,
<note place="margin">DELTA OF THE INDUS.</note> as it was in the time of the antients, unhealthy, and hot to the extreme: all its fertility cannot compenſate thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. There is a greater and leſſer <hi>Delta;</hi> the greater begins a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0792500101:46"/>few leagues from <hi>Hydrabad:</hi> the branch called <hi>Nala Sunkra,</hi> forms the eaſtern ſide; the leſſer is included in the former, and its northern point is at <hi>Aurungabander.</hi> The <hi>Delta</hi> is of great extent, each ſide being a hundred and fifteen miles. From the ſea as high as <hi>Moultan,</hi> is a low and level country, enriched with the water annually overflowing like the river <hi>Nile.</hi> The <hi>Indus,</hi> from the beginning of the <hi>Delta,</hi> almoſt as high as <hi>Moultan,</hi> runs through a flat tract, bounded by a parallel range of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, diſtant from the banks of the river from thirty to forty miles. That on the weſtern ſide is rocky, that on the eaſtern compoſed of ſand. The laſt, when it approaches the <hi>Delta,</hi> conforms to its ſhape on the eaſtern ſide, and diverges till it reaches the ſea.</p>
               <p>BEYOND the eaſtern chain is a vaſt ſandy deſert,
<note place="margin">SANDY DESERT OF REGISTAN.</note> extending the whole way above a hundred miles in breadth, and in length reaches from near Lat. 23° N. almoſt as high as the fertile <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jab,</hi> or Lat. 29° 30′.

                  <q>THE <hi>Jiggerkhar</hi> throws on the fire the grain before deſcribed, which thereupon ſpreads to the ſize of a diſh, and he diſtributes it amongſt his fellows to be eaten, which ceremony concludes the life of the faſcinated perſon. A <hi>Jig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerkhar</hi> is able to communicate his art to another, and which he does by learning him the incantations, and by making him eat a bit of the liver cake. If any one cut open the calf of the magician's leg, extract the grain, and give it to the afflicted perſon to eat, he immediately recovers. Theſe <hi>Jiggerkhars</hi> are moſtly women. It is ſaid, moreover, that they can bring intelligence from a great diſtance in a ſhort ſpace of time, and if they are thrown into a river with a ſtone tied to them, they nevertheleſs will not ſink. In order to deprive any one of this wicked power, they brand his temples, and every joint in his body; cram his eyes with ſalt, ſuſpend him for forty days in a ſubterraneous cavern, and repeat over him certain incantations. In this ſtate he is called <hi>Detcherch.</hi> Although, after having undergone this diſcipline, he is not able to deſtroy the liver of any one, yet he retains the power of being able to diſcover another <hi>Jiggerkhar,</hi> and is uſed for detecting thoſe diſturbers of mankind.

               <p>
                  <hi>Moultan</hi> was taken by one of the generals of <hi>Tamerlane.</hi> Since the ravages made in this province, after the invaſion of <hi>India</hi> by <hi>Kouli Khan,</hi> a conqueror equally barbarous, the trade

                  <note place="margin">THE BEHUT.</note> the moſt celebrated of the five rivers, the <hi>Fabuloſus Hydaſpes,</hi> which flows in two magnificent meanders, and iſſuing from a narrow gap between exalted mountains, from its origin in the romantic <hi>Caſhmere;</hi> partly along a plain, partly at the foot of mountains cloathed with foreſts of trees of ſize magnificent, many of which are periſhing continually through weight of years, and others ſucceeding them in the full verdure and vigor of youth. Would my pen could be inſpired like that of M. <hi>Bernier,</hi> who in 1664 attended in quality of a phyſician, and philoſophic friend, to a great <hi>Omrah</hi> of that time, a follower of <hi>Aurengezebe</hi> in his ſplendid progreſs to <hi>Caſhmere</hi> for the recovery of his health, by a change of the burning clime of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> for the ſalubrious air of the former. I leave to the reader the peruſal of <hi>Bernier,</hi> the firſt traveller, I may ſay, of his, or any other age. I ſhall in a very abridged form take up the account from the departure of the court from <hi>Agra.</hi> His ſuite was an army. He was alſo attended by his ſiſter, which gave ſplendor unſpeakable to the train of ladies. He left <hi>Agra</hi> in the moment pronounced fortunate by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial aſtrologers. To this day nothing is done without their auſpices. He took the road to <hi>Lahore,</hi> hunting or hawking on each ſide as occaſion offered. Among the nobler game, a lion preſented itſelf. In croſſing the rivers bridges of boats were uſed for the purpoſe. The heats on the march were dreadful,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0792500101:60"/>cauſed by the lofty mountains of <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> keeping the cool air of the north from refreſhing the parched plains. Between the <hi>Chenaub</hi> and the <hi>Behut</hi> is the vaſt mountain <hi>Bember.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">MOUNTAIN BEMBER.</note> It ſeems like a purgatory to be paſſed before the entrance into the PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RADISE of <hi>Hindooſtan</hi> can be accompliſhed. It is ſteep, black, and burned. The proceſſion encamped in the channel of a large torrent, dried up, full of ſand and ſtones burning hot. "After paſſing the <hi>Bember,</hi>" ſays the elegant traveller,
<q>we paſs from a torrid to a temperate zone: for we had no ſooner mounted this dreadful wall of the world, I mean, this high, ſteep, black and bald mountain of <hi>Bember,</hi> but that in deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other ſide, we found an air that was pretty tolerable, freſh, gentle, and temperate. But that which ſurpriſed me more in theſe mountains, was to find myſelf in a trice tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the <hi>Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe.</hi> For ſeeing the earth covered with all our plants and ſhrubbs, except <hi>Iſſop,</hi> Thyme, Marjoram,
<note place="margin">EUROPEAN TREES.</note> and Roſemary, I imagined I was in ſome of our mountains of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> in the midſt of a foreſt of all our kinds of Trees, Pines, Oaks, Elms, Plane-trees. And I was the more aſtoniſhed, becauſe in all thoſe burning fields of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> whence I came, I had ſeen almoſt nothing of all that.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>AMONG other things relating to plants this ſurprized me, that one and a half days journey from <hi>Bember</hi> I found a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that was covered with them on both ſides, but with this difference, that on the ſide of the mountain that was ſoutherly, towards the <hi>Indies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">INDIAN.</note> there was a mixture of <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> plants, and on that which was expoſed to the North, I obſerved none but <hi>European</hi> ones; as if the former had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0792500101:61"/>of the air and temper of <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the other had been meerly <hi>European.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I NOW enter the kingdom of <hi>Caſhmere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">KINGDOM OF CASHMERE.</note> and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the words of the elegant traveller.
<q>Thouſands of caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades deſcend from the ſurrounding mountains of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting plain, and forming rivulets meandring through all parts render it ſo fair and fruitful, that one would take this whole kingdom for ſome great <hi>Evergreen</hi> garden, intermixed with villages and burroughs, diſcovering themſelves between trees, and diverſiſied by Meadows, Fields of Rice, Corn, and divers other Legumes, of Hemp and Saffron; all interlaced with ditches full of water, with Channels, with ſmall Lakes and Rivulets here and there. Up and down and every where are alſo ſeen ſome of our <hi>European</hi> plants, Flowers, and all ſorts of our Trees, as Apples, Pears, Prunes, Apricots, Cherries, Nuts, Vines; the particular Gardens are full of Melons, Skirrets, Beets, Radiſhes, all ſorts of our Pot-herbs, and of ſome we have not.</q>

               <p>THIS HAPPY VALLEY, this PARADISE OF HINDOOSTAN,
<note place="margin">ONCE A LAKE.</note> of the <hi>Indian</hi> poets, is of an oval form, about eighty miles long and forty broad, and was once ſuppoſed to have been entirely filled with water; which having burſt its mound, left this vale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched to the moſt diſtant ages by the ſertilizing mud of the rivers which fed its expanſe. This delicious ſpot is ſurrounded by mountains of vaſt height and rude aſpect, covered with ſnow, or enchaſed in glacieres, in which this enchanting jewel is firmly ſet. At the foot of the exterior chain is an interior circle of hills, fertile in graſs, abundant in trees and various ſorts of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, and full of all kinds of cattle, as Cows, Sheep, Goats,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0792500101:62"/>Gazelles, and Muſks. The approach to <hi>Caſhmere</hi> is alſo very rugged and difficult. We have mentioned the mountains of <hi>Bember;</hi> beſides thoſe is one on which the pioneers of <hi>Aurenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebe</hi> were obliged to cut through a <hi>glaciere,</hi> or a great maſs, as <hi>Bernier</hi> calls it, of icy ſnow
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 103.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE capital of this happy ſpot is ſometimes called <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Sirinagur,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Nagaz</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">By Chereſiddin, in his Life of Timur Bee, ii. 96.</note>, is ſeated in Lat. 34° 12′ North, on the banks of the river, which runs with a current moſt remarkably ſmooth. At a little diſtance from it is a ſmall but beautiful lake, with a communication with the river by a navigable canal. The town was, in <hi>Bernier</hi>'s time, three quarters of a <hi>French</hi> league long, built on both ſides, and ſome part extended to the lake. Villas, Moſques, and Pagodas, decorate ſeveral of the little hills that border the water. The houſes are built of wood, four ſtories high, ſome higher; the lower is for the cattle, the next for the family, the third and fourth ſerve as warehouſes. The roofs are planted with tulips, which in the ſpring produce a wonderful effect. Roſes, and numberleſs other flowers ornament this happy clime. The inhabitants often viſit the lake in their boats for the pleaſure of hawking, the country abounding with cranes, and variety of game.</p>
               <p>THE river,
<note place="margin">RIVER BEHUT, OR IHLUM.</note> which riſes at <hi>Wair Naig,</hi> near the ſouthern part of the ſurrounding mountains, flows with a north-weſtern courſe by the capital, and falls into lake <hi>Ouller,</hi> which is fifty-three miles in length, and lies in the northern part of the valley, not remote from the kingdom of great <hi>Thibet,</hi> then paſſes through the outlet at <hi>Barehmooleh,</hi> between two ſteep mountains, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0792500101:63"/>from thence, after a long courſe, to its junction with the <hi>Chunaub.</hi> This river is large and navigable, even within the limits of <hi>Caſhmere. Bernier,</hi> p. 84. ſays, it carries boats as large as thoſe on the <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> Many ſmall lakes are ſpread over the ſurface, and ſome of them contain floating iſlands. Among others, <hi>Bernier,</hi> p. 118. viſited one, which he calls
<q>A great lake amidſt the mountains, which had ice in ſummer, and looked like a little icy ſea, having heaps of ice made and unmade by the winds.</q> This reminds me of the coalition and ſeparation of the ice in the <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> ſeas. This in queſtion may be like the <hi>Ouller,</hi> for I ſee none of any ſize in the maps, excepting that expanſe of water.</p>
               <p>AMONG the miraculous waters of the natives, he reckons a periodical ſpring, or the ebbing and flowing well of <hi>Sandbrarc,</hi> which has near to it the temple of the idol of <hi>Brare.</hi> The reader may amuſe himſelf with the account, from p. 105 to 110 of this favorite writer, and at p. 117 thoſe of another, much of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>THE author of the <hi>Ayeen Akberry</hi> dwells with rapture on the beauties of <hi>Caſhmere;</hi> whence we may conclude, that it was a favorite ſubject with his maſter <hi>Acbar,</hi> who had viſited it three times before <hi>Abulfazel</hi> wrote. Other emperors of <hi>Hindooſtan</hi> viſited it alſo, and ſeemed to forget the cares of government during their reſidence in the HAPPY VALLEY. By the ſalubrity of the air, and the chearing beauties of the place, they collected new vigor to reſume the cares of government. The remains of the palaces, pavilion, and gardens, exhibit proofs of their elegance and ſplendor. It appears, that the periodical rains, which almoſt deluge the reſt of <hi>India,</hi> are ſhut out of <hi>Caſhmere</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0792500101:64"/>by the height of the mountains, ſo that only light ſhowers fall there; theſe, however, are in abundance ſufficient to feed the thouſands of caſcades which are precipitated into the valley from every part of the ſtupendous and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic bulwark that encircles it. Amidſt the various feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the <hi>Caſhmerians,</hi> one dreadful evil they are conſtantly ſubject to, namely, earthquakes; but to guard againſt their terrible effects, all their houſes are built of wood, of which there is no want.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Caſhmerians</hi> are eſteemed a moſt witty race, and much more intelligent and ingenious than the <hi>Hindoos,</hi> and as much addicted to the ſciences and to poetry as the very <hi>Perſians.</hi> They have a language of their own: but their books are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the <hi>Shanſcrit</hi> tongue, although the character be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Caſhmerian</hi>

The courtiers of the time of <hi>Bernier</hi> were moſt ſolicitous to obtain for their <hi>Zenanas</hi> the <hi>Caſhmerian</hi> fair, in order that they might have children whiter than the natives of <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> in order that they might paſs for the true <hi>Mogul</hi>-breed, congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with their monarch.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Caſhmerians</hi> ſeem to have had an idea of the deluge, for, ſay they, in the early ages of the world, all <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> except the mountains, was covered with water.

               <p>HERE are numbers of hermits in places nearly inacceſſible. They are highly venerated, ſome being ſuppoſed to have power to excite the fury of the elements. <hi>Bernier,</hi> p. 104, found an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient anchoute, who had inhabited the ſummit of the lofty moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pire-penjale</hi> ever ſince the time of <hi>Jehangire,</hi> who was here in 1618. His religion was unknown. To him was attributed the power of working miracles. He cauſed at his pleaſure great
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0792500101:66"/>thunders, and raiſed ſtorms of hail, rain, ſnow, and wind. He looked ſavage, having a large white beard uncombed, which, like that of our Druid, "ſtreamed like a meteor to the troubled air." The ſage forbid the making the leſt noiſe, on pain of raiſing furious ſtorms and tempeſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſhmere</hi> is famous for its manufacture of <hi>ſhawls,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SHAWLS.</note> made of the wool of the broad-tailed ſheep, who are found in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Thibet;</hi> and their fleeces, in fineneſs, beauty, and length, ſays Mr. <hi>Bogle,</hi> in Ph. Tranſ. lxviii. 485, exceed all others in the world. The <hi>Caſhmerians</hi> engroſs this article, and have factors in all parts of <hi>Thibet</hi> for buying up the wool, which is ſent into <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> and worked into <hi>ſhawls,</hi> ſuperior in elegance to thoſe woven even from the fleeces of their own country. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture is a conſiderable ſource of wealth. <hi>Bernier</hi> relates, that in his days, <hi>ſhawls</hi> made expreſsly for the great <hi>Omrahs,</hi> of the <hi>Thibetian</hi> wool, coſt a hundred and fifty <hi>roupees,</hi> whereas thoſe made of the wool of the country never coſt more than fifty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Akbar</hi> was a moſt particular encourager of the manufacture. He not only paid a great attention to thoſe of this province, but introduced them into <hi>Lahore,</hi> where, in his days, there were a thouſand manufactories, ſays <hi>Abulfazul,</hi> of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. The natural color of the wool of the <hi>Tools aſſel,</hi> the name of the animal, is grey, tinged with red, but ſome are quite white. <hi>Akbar</hi> firſt introduced the dying them. The wool of another animal uſed in the manufacture is white or black, out out of which were woven white, black, and grey ſhawls. Poſſibly two ſorts of animals may produce the material; one
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0792500101:67"/>indiſputably the ſheep I mention, the other I have heard called a goat.</p>
               <p>THE domeſtic animals of this country are horſes, ſmall, hardy, and ſure-footed. Cows, black and ugly, but yield plenty of milk and excellent butter. Here is alſo a ſheep, called <hi>Hundoo,</hi> which is uſed to carry burdens. No deſcription is left to vindicate me for imagining it to be either the camel, <hi>(Llama,</hi> Hiſt. Quad. i. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 73.) or the <hi>Chilihucque</hi> (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 74.); the firſt of which is uſed for burdens in <hi>Peru,</hi> the laſt, formerly in <hi>Chili.</hi> Certain it is that <hi>India</hi> has a tall ſheep, which, ſaddled, actually can carry a boy twelve years old. It is found about <hi>Surat.</hi> Whether it could bear the ſnows of the <hi>Caſhmerian</hi> Alps, I leave for the ſubject of future inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abulfazul,</hi> p. 155, vol. ii. mentions the elk as one of the wild animals of the country; and adds, that the hunting leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards are made uſe of in the chaſe of that enormous deer. The <hi>Chittah,</hi> or hunting leopard, muſt be brought from the ſcorched plains of <hi>Bengal.</hi> The elk may be a native of the woods at the baſe of the ſnowy mountains, for they are impatient of heat, and require foreſts, for they ſubſiſt both by browzing and by grazing.</p>

A little above <hi>Attock</hi> is <hi>Bazaar,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Forſter</hi> croſſed the <hi>Indus.</hi> The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary journey of that gentleman merits notice.

<q>
                     <hi>Cytor</hi> is an antient ruined city, on a hill, but ſhews the footſteps of wonderful magnificence. There are ſtill ſtanding above a hundred churches, all of carved ſtone, many fair towers and lanthorns, many pillars, and innumerable houſes, but not one inhabitant. There is but one ſteep aſcent cut out of the rock, and four gates in the aſcent before you come to the city gate, which is magnificent.

               <p>LET not this, or ſeveral other inſtances of unprincely barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be attributed to the influence of climate. The greateſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0792500101:74"/>monarchs, bred under the ſevereſt ſkies, have ſhewn themſelves monſters of cruelties, notwithſtanding they have been held up to us as models of greatneſs.

And in <hi>Hindooſtan,</hi> the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Akbar,</hi> and others, ſucceſſors or predeceſſors. Their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are the reſult of education; indulged firſt in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-paſſion, then in thoſe of youth, till they become ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and every oppoſition to their will appears criminal, and brings on the moſt dreadful revenge, and the frequent havoke of the human race.

<q>after we had dined, and reſted a while, we cauſed ourſelves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0792500101:82"/>to ſee a famous hoſpital of birds, of all forts, which, for being ſick, lame, deprived of their mates, or otherwiſe needing food, and cure, are kept and tended there with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; as alſo the men who take care of them are maintained by the public alms; the <hi>Indian</hi> Gentiles (who, with <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and the antient <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the firſt authors of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, according to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> believe the tranſinigration of fouls, not only from man to man, but alſo from man to brute beaſt) conceiving it no leſs a work of charity to do good to beaſts, than to men. The houſe of this hoſpital is ſmall, a little room ſufficing for many birds: Yet I ſaw it full of birds of all ſorts which need tendance, as cocks, hens, pigeons, peacocks, ducks, and ſmall birds, which during their being lame or ſick, or mateleſs, are kept here; but, being recovered and in good plight, if they be wild, they are let go at liberty; if domeſtic, they are given to ſome pious perſon, who keeps them in his houſe. The moſt curious thing I ſaw in this place, was certain little mice, who, being found orphans without fire or dam to tend them, were put into this hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and a venerable old man with a white beard, keeping them in a box amongſt cotton, very diligently tended them, with his ſpectacles on his noſe, giving them milk to eat with a bird's feather, becauſe they were ſo little that as yet they could eat nothing elſe; and, as he told us, he intended when they were grown up to let them go free whither they pleaſed.</q>

                  <q>we ſaw another hoſpital of goats, kids, ſheep, and wethers, either ſick or lame;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0792500101:83"/>and there were alſo ſome cocks, peacocks, and other animals needing the ſame help, and kept altogether quietly enough, in a great court: nor wanted there men and women, lodged in little rooms of the ſame hoſpital, who had care of them. In another place, far from hence, we ſaw another hoſpital of cows and calves, ſome whereof had broken legs, others, more infirm, very old or lean, and therefore were kept here to be cured. Among the beaſts there was alſo a <hi>Mahometan</hi> thief, who, having been taken in theft, had both his hands cut off; but the compaſſionate Gentiles, that he might not periſh miſerably, now he was no longer able to get his living, took him into this place, and kept him among the poor beaſts, not ſuffering him to want any thing. Moreover, without one of the gates of the city, we ſaw another great troop of cows, calves, and goats, which being cured and brought into better plight, or gathered together from being diſperſed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out maſters, or being redeemed with money from the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> who would have killed them to eat, (namely, the goats and other animals, but not the cows and calves) were ſent into the field to feed by neat-herds, purpoſely maintained at the public charge; and thus they are kept, till, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to perfect health, 'tis found fitting to give them to ſome citizens or others, who may charitably keep them. I excepted cows and calves from the animals redeemed from ſlaughter; becauſe in <hi>Cambaia,</hi> cows, calves, and oxen are not killed by any; and there is a great prohibition againſt it, by the inſtance of the Gentiles, who upon this account pay a great ſum of money to the prince; and ſhould any, either

The words of that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent writer Mr. <hi>Rennel,</hi> will beſt convey the idea of the importance of this invaluable tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I CANNOT cloſe this account without remarking the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable negligence we are guilty of, in delaying to build teek ſhips of war for the uſe of the <hi>Indian</hi> ſeas. They might be freighted home, without the ceremony of regular equipment, as to maſts, ſails, and furniture, which might be calculated juſt to anſwer the purpoſe of the home paſſage at the beſt ſeaſon; and crews could be provided in <hi>India.</hi> The letter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, which was written with the beſt intentions, nine or ten years ago, will explain the circumſtances of the caſe.
<note place="margin">VAST DURA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.</note> Teek ſhips of forty years old and upwards, are no uncommon objects in the <hi>Indian</hi> ſeas; while an <hi>European</hi> built ſhip is ruined there in five years. The ſhips built at <hi>Bombay</hi> are the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0792500101:100"/>beſt, both in point of work manſhip and materials, of any that are conſtructed in <hi>India:</hi> and although fourth rates only are mentioned in the letter, there is no doubt but that third rates may be conſtructed, as there is a choice of timber. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> build capital ſhips in their foreign ſettlements. The <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company have a teek ſhip on her fourth voyage at preſent, which ſhip has wintered in <hi>England,</hi> therefore any objection founded on the effects of froſt on the teek timber, is done away.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>FREQUENT have been the opportunities I have had of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how very rapid the decay of ſhips built of <hi>European</hi> timber is in the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> and, on the contrary, how du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the ſhips are, that are built of the wood of that country; namely, the teek, which may not improperly be ſtyled <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> oak. The number of ſhips of war that were ruined in thoſe ſeas during the late war (1757 to 1762) may be admitted as a proof of the former remark; and the great age of the ſhips built in <hi>India</hi> may ſerve to prove the latter. What I mean to infer from this, for your Lordſhip's uſe is, that ſhips of war under third rates may be conſtructed in <hi>India,</hi> and with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate repairs laſt for ages; whereas a ſhip of <hi>European</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can remain there but a very few years; to which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage may be added, that of loſing, in the mean time, the ſervices of the ſhips that are ſent to relieve the worn out ones.</q>

               <p>FROM time to time they extended their dominions to a vaſt magnitude,

<q>perhaps afford ſome meaſure of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to <hi>European</hi> curioſity, to be informed that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined troops of <hi>Aſia,</hi> generally inflamed with <hi>bang,</hi> and other intoxicating drugs, pour forth, as they advance, a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of menacing and abuſive language on their adverſaries. Every expreſſion of contempt and averſion, every threat, fitted to make an impreſſion of terror, or to excite ideas of horror, that cuſtom readily preſents, or inventive fancy can ſuggeſt, accompanies the utmoſt ferocity of looks, voice, and geſture. A murmuring ſound, with clouds of duſt, announce their approach, while they are yet at the diſtance of ſeveral miles. As they advance, their accents are more and more diſtinctly heard, until at laſt, with their eyes fixed and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons pointed at ſome individual, they devote him, with many execrations, to deſtruction, giving his fleſh, like the heroes in <hi>Homer,</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtine</hi> warriors, to the dogs, and the birds of the air, and the beaſts of the field. The numbers of the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> armies, the ferocity of their manner, and the novelty of their appearance, would unnerve and overcome the hearts of the ſmall <hi>European</hi> bodies that are oppoſed to them in the field of battle, if experience had not ſufficiently
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0792500101:106"/>proved how much the ſilence of diſcipline excels barbarian noiſe; and uniformity of deſign and action, the deſultory efforts of brutal force, acting by ſtarts, and liable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of accidental impreſſion.</q>

               <p>THE land, from the mouth of the river of <hi>Surat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CAPE ST. JOHN.</note> makes a ſlight curvature as far as Cape <hi>St. John,</hi> or the <hi>Baryagazenum Promontorium.</hi> From this Cape, as far as <hi>Bombay</hi> (according to our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> pilot) the coaſt is ſkirted with iſlands, divided from the continent, and from each other, by very narrow channels. To the north of it is <hi>Damoon,</hi> a ſtrong place, poſſeſſed,
<note place="margin">DAMOON.</note> in the laſt century, by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but now in a moſt ruinous ſtate. It was once beſieged by <hi>Aurengzebe,</hi> who had determined to take it by ſtorm, and fixed on a <hi>Sunday</hi> for the attack, thinking that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> like the <hi>Jews,</hi> would on that day make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The Governor, an old ſoldier, cauſed maſs to be ſaid at midnight; then made a ſally with all his cavalry, and a ſtrong body of infantry, into a quarter guarded by two hundred ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; he knew the dread thoſe animals had of fire: he aſſailed them with fire-works. The diſtracted beaſts, in the darkneſs of the night, and without their governors, ruſhed on their own forces, which put the army into ſuch diſorder, that before morning, half was cut to pieces by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and, in conſequence, the ſiege raiſed.</p>
               <p>THE tract that borders on the ſea,
<note place="margin">CONCAN.</note> from <hi>Bombay</hi> even as far as <hi>Soonda,</hi> in Lat. 15°, is called <hi>Concan.</hi> This was the <hi>Lymirica</hi> of <hi>Arrian,</hi> ii. 171, a coaſt full of ports, of which he enumerates ſeveral; it once formed part of the kingdom of <hi>Viſiapour.</hi> At the partition teaty it was confirmed to the <hi>Mahrattas,</hi> who now
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0792500101:107"/>poſſeſs a line of coaſt of three hundred miles in extent; out of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſs <hi>Bombay</hi> and its adjacent iſles, and the ſtrong hold of <hi>Victoria:</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſe, Goa,</hi> and the antient domain belonging to that once famous <hi>emporium.</hi> The part of the <hi>Concan</hi> next to the ſea is low, but at a ſmall diſtance inland riſes into vaſt ſtrength. It is guarded by the celebrated mountains the <hi>Ghauts,</hi> which riſe to a ſurpriſing height, and oppoſe to the weſt a mural front with <hi>Ghauts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">THE GHAUTS.</note> i. e. paſſes. They are the ſame which the <hi>Welſh</hi> call a <hi>Bwlch.</hi> From the word <hi>Ghaut</hi> the whole chain derives its name. They give entrance into the lofty, fertile, and populous plains of boundleſs view, which they ſupport in the manner as buttreſſes do a terrace, formed on an immenſe ſcale. Theſe run not remote from the ſea from <hi>Surat</hi> to Cape <hi>Comorin,</hi> at ſome places ſeventy miles diſtant, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally forty, and in one place they advance to within ſix. They have leſſer hills at their baſes, clothed with foreſts, particularly of the valuable <hi>teek.</hi> The plains are bleſt, from their ſituation, with a cool and healthy air. From the ſides of the mountains precipitate magnificent cataracts, forming torrents, the means of facilitating the conveyance of the timber, and giving a thouſand pictureſque ſcenes amidſt the foreſts.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Ghauts</hi> are diſtinguiſhed into the weſtern and the eaſtern.
<note place="margin">EASTERN, &amp;c.</note> The firſt extend, as I have deſcribed, uninterruptedly from <hi>Surat</hi> to the paſs of <hi>Palicaudchery,</hi> when near <hi>Coimbetore</hi> they ſuddenly turn, deeply undulating to the north. Then, at the paſs of <hi>Gujethetty,</hi> wind north and north-eaſterly as high as <hi>Amboor</hi> and <hi>Mugglee,</hi> the laſt about eighty miles due weſt of <hi>Madras.</hi> From hence they are not, by reaſon of the numbers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0792500101:108"/>of branches, ſufficiently marked on the maps: they ſeem to take a northerly courſe, to comprehend <hi>Aurungabad,</hi> to croſs the <hi>Tapteè,</hi> and continue weſterly, at irregular diſtances from the river, till they arrive at a certain ſpace from <hi>Surat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE whole chain, eſpecially in the <hi>Concan,</hi> ſeems a connected wall, inacceſſible to the ſummit, unleſs by paths worked by the hand of man, and is not to be aſcended even by a ſingle travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, without the fatiguing labor of many hours; horrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, roaring cataracts, and frequent reverberating echoes, terrify the paſſenger on each ſide; often violent guſts ariſe, and hurry men and cattle into the black immeaſurable abyſs. Having attained the ſummit, the trouble is repaid by the magnificent proſpect to the weſt, of the far ſubjacent country, broken into hills, and clothed with beautiful vegetation; the coaſt, the iſlands, and the immenſity of ocean.</p>
               <p>THESE <hi>Indian Appenines</hi> mark with preciſion the limits of the winter and ſummer,

               <p>IN Lat. 18° 58″ is a very conſiderable bay, filled with iſlands,
<note place="margin">BAY OF BOMBAY.</note> well known by the name of <hi>Bombay,</hi> which forms the beſt and moſt ſecure harbour in <hi>India.</hi> This, as well as every part of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0792500101:109"/>this coaſt, was the uſurped property of the <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> but the greateſt part of this extremity was wreſted from them by the <hi>Mahrattas;</hi> a few places they retained for ſome time, but at length all fell under the power of the new uſurpers. Among the places was <hi>Baſſein,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BASSEIN.</note> which had been taken by <hi>Nugns d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cugna,</hi> viceroy of <hi>India,</hi> in 1555, and by him ſtrongly fortified. It was in our days ſeized by the <hi>Mahrattas,</hi> and again, in 1780, by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under General <hi>Goddard,</hi> who reſtored it to its late maſters by the treaty of 1782.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR <hi>Fryer,</hi> who viſited this city about the year 1670, when it was in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> ſpeaks of it as a very conſiderable place, having ſix churches, four convents, a college of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and another of <hi>Franciſcans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ABOUT twenty miles from <hi>Baſſein,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VISRABUY.</note> inland, is <hi>Viſrabuy,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for its hot wells, which are in high eſteem for their medicinal virtues, and accounted, by the <hi>Hindoos,</hi> of great ſanctity.</p>
               <p>THE principal iſle is that of <hi>Salſette,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ISLE OF SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SETTE.</note> which is divided from the continent by a very narrow channel; it is about fifteen miles in circumference, and rich in fruits and vegetables. General <hi>Goddard</hi> included this iſland in his other conqueſts. It was wiſely retained on the concluſion of the peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by the laſt peace, together with ſome little iſles or rocks that lay within the important bay. <hi>Salſette</hi> was gallantly defended by an old man of ninety-two, who, being ſummoned to ſurrender, anſwered, "He was not ſent for that purpoſe." It was not till he was ſlain in a bloody aſſault that the place was taken, but at the price of four hundred of our grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0792500101:110"/>The capture gave freſh ſecurity and importance to the iſle of <hi>Bombay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT iſland was part of the portion given to <hi>Charles</hi> II.
<note place="margin">ISLAND OF BOM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAY.</note> with his Queen, in 1662. His Majeſty ſent, in 1661, <hi>James Ley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> a moſt experienced ſailor, with a ſtrong fleet, to receive it from the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> This nobleman was killed ſoon after his return, in the bloody ſea fight againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> in 1665. "He was," ſays <hi>Clarendon,</hi>
                  <q>a man of wonderful parts in all ſorts of learning, which he took more delight in than in his title
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Clarendon's Life, ii. 508.—Anderſon's Dict. ii. 119.</note>.</q> 
                  <hi>Charles,</hi> in 1668, granted the iſland to the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, under a rent of ten pounds in gold, payable annually at the Cuſtom-houſe at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ITS length is about ſeven miles; it is flat, and at firſt was extremely unwholeſome, inſomuch, that
<q>two monſoons at <hi>Bombay</hi> is the age of a man,</q> became here a proverb; but by draining, and by prohibiting the uſe of putrid fiſh for manur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coco trees, it is rendered tolerably healthy, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the great port and ſhip yard of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> three hundred ſail can at one time lie here in ſafety.</p>
               <p>ON the iſle is the town, the docks, and arſenal,
<note place="margin">TOWN, DOCKS, &amp;c.</note> ſeated in Lat. 18° 58″ N. Long. 72° 40″ E. ſtrongly fortified; and behind them the <hi>Dungeree</hi> town for the natives. When the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ceded this place to us, it had only ten thouſand inhabitants. By our mild government, in 1764 it increaſed to ſixty thouſand. Abbe <hi>Raynal</hi> gives this iſland a hundred thouſand inhabitants, of which ſeven or eight thouſand are ſailors. Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> calls it the grand ſtorehouſe of all the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> commerce. The
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0792500101:111"/>
                  <hi>Arabs</hi> ſtill keep up a conſiderable trade in ſhips of a thouſand tons, either <hi>Indian</hi> built, or old <hi>Indiamen</hi> bought from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. One article is the <hi>Kaſmiſh</hi> raiſin, a ſpecies without ſtones, brought from <hi>Kaſmiſh,</hi> an iſle in the <hi>Perſian</hi> gulph. The exports from <hi>India</hi> are chiefly cottons, &amp;c. to a great amount; but the trade between theſe parts and the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> gulphs, has of late been much injured by caravans croſſing the iſthmus of <hi>Baſſora,</hi> conducted by the <hi>Syrians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The whole bay is full of ſhoals or rocks, yet with chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of ſufficient depth of water for the ſkilful pilate to bring in ſecurely the largeſt ſhips; and here, even our military fleets find conveniencies for heaving down and refitting. Admiral <hi>Watſon,</hi> and again Admiral <hi>Hughes,</hi> found here every ſpecies of naval ſtore; here his Majeſty's ſhips winter and refit.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH <hi>Bombay</hi> is a place of very great trade, it is wholly as a magazine; its native productions are nothing in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<note place="margin">SHIP-BUILDING.</note> unleſs you reckon ſhip-building. There the fineſt merchant ſhips in the world are built, and all of Teek. The durability of this timber is beyond belief, greater than that of our beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> oak; it reſiſts the worm longer than any other; but whether this be owing to the nature of the timber itſelf, or to the cement with which the plank is joined and covered, I cannot tell. <hi>Surat</hi> or <hi>Bombay</hi> built ſhips will certainly laſt threeſcore years (ſome ſay many more), in which time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are generally doubled once or twice, ſo that the ſides of an old ſhip are as thick as the walls of an houſe. Much is likewiſe ſaid of the number of years they ſometimes run without having occaſion to uſe a pump; but of this I cannot ſpeak
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0792500101:112"/>with certainty. All the repairs are effected by native carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all the ſhips, even the largeſt, are built by them, and in a ſimplicity of manner which would aſtoniſh an <hi>European</hi> workman. M. <hi>Sonnerat,</hi> i. tab. 18, repreſents the <hi>Indian</hi> with all the powers of his art. The neighboring mountains ſupply them with <hi>teek-wood, Bengal</hi> with iron and hemp, and the adjacent foreſts with pines for maſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bombay</hi> is alſo the great depôt of artillery, arms, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and all the means of furniſhing an army. Here is alſo a conſiderable military eſtabliſhment, at preſent under the command of Sir <hi>Robert Abercromby,</hi> K. B. Preſident of <hi>Bombay,</hi> Governor and Commander in Chief. From hence marched the force deſtined to aſſiſt in the reduction of the tyrant <hi>Tippoo Sultan,</hi> and to give peace to the ſouthern part of this vaſt continent.</p>
               <p>A MOST unfortunate expedition took its departure from this place in 1779;
<note place="margin">EXPEDITIONS FROM BOMBAY.</note> at which period it had not the happineſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the rule of a HASTINGS. A little time before, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganaut Row,</hi> a <hi>Mahratta</hi> chieftain, fled from his country, and put himſelf under the protection of this preſidency. He had been guardian to the young <hi>Paiſhwa, Naron Row,</hi> his own nephew. In the numbers of intrigues that infeſted the ſtate of <hi>Poonah,</hi> a conſpiracy was formed againſt the youth. A band of aſſaſſins were employed to murder him. <hi>Roganaut,</hi> better known by the name of <hi>Ragobah,</hi> was at the time confined in priſon. The nephew flew to ſeek ſafety in his arms. In that caſe he would have been ſafe, but he could only fling himſelf at his feet. The youth was murdered. The uncle exchanged his priſon for the <hi>Paiſhwa-ſhip.</hi> Freſh conſpiracies aroſe, and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganaut</hi>

Aſpiring to the office, he flattered the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with vaſt advantages in caſe they eſpouſed his cauſe; and ſoon prevaled on them to commence hoſtilities. <hi>Salſette, Baroach,</hi> and other places fell before them. The treaty of <hi>Poorunder,</hi> in 1774, ſecured thoſe places to us for a time. In a little ſpace war broke out again, fomented by <hi>Roganaut,</hi> aſſiſted by our fears of the <hi>French,</hi> who were buſy in their intrigues at the court of <hi>Poonah.</hi> In 1778 a ſmall army,
<note place="margin">UNDER EGER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON.</note> under the command of Brigadier General <hi>Egerton,</hi> aſſiſted by a field committee, ever embarraſſing, from the days of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> to the preſent, was ſent with him to adviſe, or rather to perplex the commanders. The army, which conſiſted of not quite four thouſand men, croſſed the bay to <hi>Uptah</hi> river, marched by <hi>Panwel, Campooly,</hi> and up the <hi>Bhore Ghaut</hi> to <hi>Candolah,</hi> which we found unoccupied: the object was <hi>Poonah.</hi> They reached the once fair city of <hi>Tullingaum,</hi> on <hi>January</hi> 1779.

This movement was conducted with ſuch ſecrecy and ſkill, that the whole of the artillery and heavy ſtores reached the foot of the paſs in ſafety, and without the ſmalleſt interruption from the enemy, who were aſtoniſhed, on

<note place="margin">FAMOUS CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNS.</note> The celebrated M. NIEBUHR, who viſited thoſe caves, and thoſe in <hi>Salſette,</hi> in 1764, has given numbers of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0792500101:116"/>elegant plates of the various figures, attended with deſcriptions. See his ſecond volume of Travels, p. 25 to 33. Mr. <hi>Gough</hi> has alſo publiſhed a moſt elaborate account of theſe wonderful caves, printed by <hi>John Nichol,</hi> in 1785.—Finally, deſcriptions may be found in the viith and viiith volumes of the <hi>Archaelogia,</hi> by the pen of Meſſrs. <hi>Mackneil, Hunter, Pyke,</hi> and <hi>Boon.</hi> The accounts are of conſiderable length, drawn up with great accuracy, and attended with figures of the principal antiquities. Vaſt hills have been excavated by human art, moſt probably for religious purpoſes. Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> gives the ground plan of that at <hi>Elephanta,</hi> by which it appears to be a hundred and eighty feet, by a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty in dimenſions: part is ſupported by vaſt pillars, of a rounded form, ſwelling at the middle, reſting on a ſquare baſe: on the ſummit of which, at each corner, is a ſitting ape. In the entrance are left pillars, nearly ſimilar, but plain, and without figures.</p>
               <p>THE inſide is divided into ſeveral ſquare apartments, the greateſt propt by the pillars above deſcribed, and is a hundred and four feet ſquare. At each angle it is divided into three ſmall ſquare rooms; and at one of the entrances within (for there are three) is another, all, perhaps, chapels. Theſe are expreſſed in Mr. <hi>Pyke</hi>'s plan.</p>
               <p>IN every cave, deſcribed by theſe curious travellers, are moſt amazing numbers of ſculptures, all cut out of the live rock, of human figures, extravagant deities, monſters, animals, foliage, and all that can aſtoniſh and bewilder the imagination. Many repreſent idols of the <hi>Indian</hi> mythology, figures half beaſt and half man; many faces and many hands to the ſame ſculpture;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0792500101:117"/>and often the <hi>Cobra de Capello,</hi> that dreadful ſnake, which is attendant on ſeveral of the incarnations of <hi>Viſtchenou.</hi> A fiſh is one, which aſſiſts to explain the object of the ſculptures and uſes of the excavations.</p>
               <p>THESE caverns are the haunts of monſtrous ſerpents. <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> i. 239, tells us, that on firing his fuſil, to enjoy the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing echo of the report, he diſturbed a <hi>Boa,</hi> fifteen feet in length, and two feet in girth, from its antient ſeat, which put the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to ſpeedy flight, and an end to his curioſity.</p>
               <p>MOST of the figures are coloſſal, from twelve to twenty-three feet high. Some of them, with all their extravagancies, are ſaid to be finely executed: many are croſs leg'd, in their attitude of prayer; many have roſaries, which prove that theſe places were objects of devotion.</p>
               <p>THE woman with three faces and four arms is engraven in Mr. <hi>Pyke</hi>'s account. I beg leave to make a few remarks on that figure: round her neck are five necklaces, rich in pearls and gems, with pendent jewels; her hair is long, and hangs in beautiful ringlets; her ears (not her ear-rings as they are called) hang to a vaſt length, exactly in the <hi>Malabar</hi> mode; and her head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is conic, in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> faſhion, which might have been in uſe in early times. The laſt is dropt; the ſtrange deformity of long ears are ſtill retained: ſo far is certainly of eaſtern ſculpture.</p>
               <p>BUT what can be ſaid to the figures found in another cave, in the neighborhood of <hi>Bombay,</hi> not expreſſed by name: they are engraven in volume vii. of the <hi>Archaelogia;</hi> ſome have the ſauſage curl, others the cochlear twirl, in the hair, and others
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0792500101:118"/>the rich braid of pearl; all reſembling, in ſome degree, the fantaſtic variety in the head-dreſſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> ladies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leſt trace of <hi>oriental</hi> faſhion.</p>
               <p>I SHALL conclude with ſaying, that the cave of <hi>Elephanta</hi> takes its name from an elephant, with a leſſer on its back, cut on the outſide of the cave; and in a paſſage is the rude figure of a horſe, called that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, to whom the <hi>Indians</hi> attribute theſe mighty works, as we <hi>Welſh</hi> do every thing ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous to our favorite <hi>Arthur.</hi> I mention this tradition to ſhew its great antiquity, as well as that of the excavations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Arrian,</hi> in his <hi>Periplus maris Erythraei,</hi> ii. 166, ſays that there were near <hi>Barygaza,</hi> foundations of camps, antient cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, altars, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, great wells, all attributed to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> hero.</p>
               <p>THE idols mentioned here are quite diminutive to ſome in the <hi>Soobahſhip</hi> of <hi>Caſhmere,</hi> in receſſes excavated in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which are called (ſays the <hi>Ayeen,</hi> ii. 208) <hi>Surnmii,</hi> and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been the winter retreat of the antient inhabitants; one of the figures was eighty ells high; there was a woman of fifty, and a child of fifteen. In one of theſe <hi>Surnmii</hi> was found a tomb, and in that a coffin; in which was a corpſe preſerved by medical preparations: one would ſuppoſe that the cuſtoms of the <hi>Tartars</hi> had been obſerved in this place, and burning the bodies at that time not in uſe.</p>
               <p>THE method of travelling which begins at <hi>Surat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TRAVELLING IN INDIA.</note> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued through moſt parts of <hi>India,</hi> is by oxen. The ox ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the uſe of the horſe; the ſmaller ſort ſerve as pads, the larger are uſed in drawing a kind of carriage called a hackerie.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0792500101:119"/>The beaſts are commonly white, have black noſes, and large perpendicular horns: they are alſo remarkable, like moſt other <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> cattle, for a hunch riſing between the ſhoulders. Thoſe of <hi>Guzerat</hi> are moſt remarkably large, and in great requeſt through moſt parts of <hi>India.</hi> The hunch is highly eſteemed as a delicacy, ſalted and boiled. When they are fitted for the ſaddle or the draft, a cord, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a piece of wood is paſſed through the noſe from noſtril to noſtril, and a cord extended from each end, as a bridle. M. <hi>Sonnerat,</hi> vol. i. tab. 7, gives a print of the <hi>Hackerie,</hi> or <hi>Gari,</hi> as it is called in <hi>India,</hi> and all its apparatus. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if theſe creatures are forced out of their uſual ſlow pace, it is too well known that they will faint, or lie down under their burthen; but at <hi>Bombay,</hi> they trot and gallop as naturally as horſes, and are equally as ſerviceable in every other reſpect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that, by their being ſubject to a looſe habit of body, they ſometimes incommode the traveller by the filth thrown upon him by the continual motion of their tails. Whenever they get to the end of the journey, the driver always alights, and puts the near bullock in the other's place; then he puts his hand into both their mouths, and after pulling out the froth, mounts his box again and drives back. It ſeems this precaution is abſolutely neceſſary, for as they travel at the rate of ſeven or eight miles an hour, they would otherwiſe be in danger of ſuffocation.</p>
               <p>BESIDES the large ſpecies which I have engraven in vol. i. tab. ii. of my <hi>Hiſt. Quadr.</hi> is a diminutive ſpecies, tab. iii, common at <hi>Surat,</hi> not bigger than a large dog, which has a fierce look, but is trained to draw children in their little carts. I have been
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0792500101:120"/>informed, that a bull and cow from, I believe the <hi>Tanjore</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have been imported into <hi>England,</hi> the height of the firſt not exceeding nineteen inches, and of the laſt not eighteen.</p>
               <p>BEING on the ſubject of animals,
<note place="margin">SHEEP.</note> I ſhall mention a ſpecies of the next genus, the ſheep. That called <hi>Cabrito</hi> by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi> is a very long legged kind, and of a very diſguſting appearance. At <hi>Goa</hi> it is ſometimes ſaddled and bridled, and ſerves inſtead of a poney, and will carry a child of twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>ABOUT <hi>Bombay</hi> is found the ſquirrel, <hi>Hiſt. Quadr.</hi> ii. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 336, known by the name of the place; it is very large, and of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple color.</p>
               <p>I MUST now digreſs to a very different claſs.
<note place="margin">SERPENTS.</note> The tribe of ſnakes is very numerous in <hi>India.</hi> I think their great hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher, <hi>M. de la Cepede,</hi> enumerates forty-four ſpecies already known. I ſhall only mention the moſt curious: I am uncertain whether they are quite local. Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> ſpeaks of ſome found in this iſland or neighborhood; the <hi>Cobra Capello</hi> I ſhall deſcribe ſome time hence. Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> relates, that the <hi>Cobra Manilla</hi> is only a foot long, of a bluiſh color, haunting old walls. Its bite is as fatal as that of the <hi>Cobra Capello,</hi> which kills in the ſpace of a quarter of an hour. The <hi>Cobra de Aurellia</hi> is only ſix in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, and not thicker than the quill of a crow; it is apt to creep into the ear, and occaſion death by madneſs. The ſand ſnake is ſmall, but not leſs fatal than the others. The <hi>Palmira,</hi> with a viperine head, and varied body, is four feet long, yet in no part thicker than a ſwan's quill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0792500101:121"/>AMONG the variety of beautiful ſhells found on the coaſt,
<note place="margin">TURBO SCALA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIS.</note> is the noted <hi>Turbo Scalaris,</hi> or <hi>Wentle-trap,</hi> a ſhell ſeldom an inch and a quarter long, of a pearly color, and with about ſeven ſpires, each having ſeveral elegant ridges, croſſing them from the firſt ſpire to the laſt; a ſine repreſentation of the winding ſtaircaſe. A painter I knew, filled with the <hi>Concha-mania,</hi> once gave fifty-ſix guineas for three of them, one alone he valued at twenty-five.</p>
               <p>SOME few other things, reſpecting the natural hiſtory of <hi>Bombay</hi> and its neighborhood, may be here taken notice of. The diſeaſes of <hi>India</hi> begin to ſhew themſelves in this place,
<note place="margin">BARBIERS, A DISEASE.</note> but I ſhall only attend to the <hi>Barbiers,</hi> which is more prevalent on this ſide of the peninſula of <hi>India</hi> than the other. It is a palſy, which takes its name from <hi>Beriberii,</hi> or the ſheep, as the afflicted totter in their gait like that animal when ſeized with a giddineſs. Its ſymptoms are both a numbneſs, a privation of the uſe of the limbs, a tremor, and an attendant titillation uſually not fatal, but extremely difficult of cure. It comes on ſlowly, and uſually in the rainy ſeaſon; but if a perſon drinks haſtily, when heated, a large draught of <hi>Toddy,</hi> or the liquor of the coco nut, the attack of the diſeaſe is very ſudden. <hi>Bontius, (Engliſh</hi> edition, p. 1), treats largely of the cure. He recommends ſtrongly baths or ſomentations of the <hi>Nochile</hi> of the <hi>Malabars,</hi> or <hi>Lagondi</hi> of the <hi>Malays,</hi> or the <hi>Jaſminum Indicum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE phoenomenon of ſmall fiſh appearing in the rainy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<note place="margin">FISHES FALLING ON LAND.</note> in places before dry, is as true as it is ſurpriſing. The natives begin to fiſh for them the tenth day after the firſt rains,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0792500101:122"/>and they make a common diſh at the tables. Many are the modes of accounting for this annual appearance. It has been ſuggeſted that the ſpawn may have been brought by the water fowl, or may have been caught up by the <hi>Typhons,</hi> which rage at the commencement of the wet ſeaſon, and be conveyed in the torrents of rain. I can only give an explanation much leſs violent: That theſe fiſhes never had been any where but near the places where they are found. That they have had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent ſtate, and began life in form of frogs; that it had been the <hi>Rana paradoxa</hi> of <hi>Gm. Lin.</hi> iii. p. 10. 55. Their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is certainly wonderful. I refer the reader to <hi>Seba,</hi> i. p. 125, tab. 78; and to <hi>Merian</hi>'s <hi>Surinam,</hi> p. 71, tab. 71, in which are full accounts of the wonderful phoenomenon of theſe tranſmuted reptiles, which complete their laſt transformation in the firſt rains.</p>
               <p>ALL kinds of reptiles appear about that ſeaſon, among others,
<note place="margin">TOADS, VAST.</note> toads of moſt enormous ſizes. Mr. <hi>Ives</hi> mentions one that he ſuppoſed weighed between four and five pounds; and meaſured, from the toe of the fore to that of the hind leg, twenty-two inches.</p>
               <p>I NOW leave the bay, after ſaying that the tides here, and at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay,</hi> riſe to an amazing height; this muſt be underſtood, when they are pent up in bays or gulphs, for on the open ſhore they do not riſe above a foot and a half. Into the eaſtern ſide flows the river <hi>Pen,</hi> with ſtoney and ſteep banks. Immediately beyond the mouth, the land reſumes its courſe.
<note place="margin">ISLES OF KA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARA AND HUNARY.</note> The iſles of <hi>Kanara</hi> and <hi>Hunary,</hi> appear at no great diſtance from ſhore, ſmall and lofty. <hi>Sevatjee</hi> ſeized on the firſt, in defiance of every effort
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0792500101:123"/>of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Bombay.</hi> He fortified this little ſpot. Finding ourſelves too weak to remove ſo dangerous a neighbor, we ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up againſt him the <hi>Siddee,</hi> or admiral to <hi>Aurengzebe.</hi> This brought on ſeveral ſharp naval actions
<note n="*" place="bottom">Orme's Fragments, 122.</note>. The <hi>Siddee</hi> ſeized on the neighboring <hi>Hunary;</hi> and each party carrying on a cruel war, gave importance to theſe inconſiderable ſpots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Choule</hi> and <hi>Victoria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CHOULE.</note> and ſeveral other ſmall places, are given in the charts on this coaſt. <hi>Dunda Rajapore</hi> was a port, the rendezvous of <hi>Aurengzebe</hi>'s fleet, under the command of his <hi>Siddee.</hi> The <hi>Siddee</hi> was an office formed at the time when the <hi>Mogul</hi> empire firſt extended itſelf to theſe coaſts. Its duty was like that of the <hi>Comes Littoris Saxonici,</hi> on the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhores, and was here intended to repel the inſults of the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> or <hi>Portugueſe</hi> cruizers; as the <hi>Roman Comes</hi> was thoſe of the <hi>Norman</hi> rovers. In the year 1682 there were a hundred and twenty <hi>Gallivats,</hi> and fifteen Grabs; and a vaſt army encamped in the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>Correſpondent to them, were <hi>Nitrias,</hi> the modern <hi>Newtya, Tynadis, Muziris,</hi> and numbers of other ports mentioned by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtorians.
<note place="margin">PIRATE COAST.</note> This is the <hi>Pirate coaſt,</hi> and extends almoſt from <hi>Bombay</hi> till we have arrived very near to <hi>Goa.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were obliged to put on board their merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips a number of archers to defend them againſt the attacks of the pirates
<note n="†" place="bottom">Plin. Nat. Hiſt. lib. vi. c. 23.</note>, which, according to the <hi>Univerſal Hiſtory,</hi> x. p. 267, are ſaid to have been <hi>Arabians.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rennel</hi> gives an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſcription of this extent of free-booters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0792500101:124"/>
                  <q>PERHAPS there are few coaſts ſo much broken into ſmall bays and harbours, and that at the ſame time have ſo ſtraight a general outline. This multitude of ſmall ports, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted view along ſhore, and elevated coaſts, ſavourable to diſtant viſion, have ſitted this coaſt for the ſeat of piracy; and the alternate land and ſea breezes that prevail during a great part of the year, oblige veſſels to navigate very near the ſhore. No wonder then that <hi>Pliny</hi> ſhould notice them in his time as committing depredations on the <hi>Roman Eaſt India</hi> trade; and although a temporary check has been given them in the deſtruction of <hi>Angria</hi>'s fleets, &amp;c. yet we may expect that they will continue the practice while commerce laſts. They are protected by the ſhallowneſs of their ports, and the ſtrength of the country within. As pirates, they have greater natural advantages than thoſe of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to roam far from their coaſts, have expenſive outſets; here the prizes come to their own doors, and the cruizers may lie ſecure in port until the prey is diſcovered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE veſſels uſed by theſe pirates are of two kinds.
<note place="margin">GRABS.</note> The larger are called <hi>Grabs:</hi> a few have three maſts, and carry three hundred tons; the leſſer have only two maſts, and are of the burden of a hundred and fifty tons. On the main deck, under the fore-caſtle, are mounted two cannons, nine or ten pounders, pointing forwards, and firing over the prow
<note n="*" place="bottom">Orme, i. p. 409.</note>, which is conſtructed like that of a <hi>Mediterranean</hi> galley. The cannons on the broadſide are from ſix to nine pounders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0792500101:125"/>
                  <hi>Gallivats</hi> are large row boats,
<note place="margin">GALLIVATS.</note> built like the <hi>Grabs,</hi> but do not exceed ſeventy tons. The larger carry ſix or eight cannons, from two to four pounders: the leſſer only petteraroes: but both are furniſhed with forty or fifty ſtout oars, which are rowed at the rate of four miles an hour: both <hi>Grabs</hi> and <hi>Gallivats</hi> are crowded with men. Eight or ten of the latter, and forty or fifty of the former, compoſe <hi>Angria</hi>'s principal fleet for attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhips of force. They ſcruple not to make prize of every one which does not condeſcend to purchaſe their paſſports.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they deſcry a ſail they ſlip from port, and ſail as faſt as the wind: or, if it is calm, ſoon reach the object with their oars: the <hi>Gallivats</hi> taking the <hi>Grabs</hi> in tow. They then aſſemble on the ſtern of the chace within cannon ſhot, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſmaſt her. As ſoon as they ſucceed, they ſurround and batter her on all ſides. If the ſhip makes an obſtinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, a number of <hi>Gallivats,</hi> with two or three hundred men in each, board her ſword in hand from all quarters, and in the ſame inſtant. I am obliged to Mr. <hi>Orme</hi>'s claſſical hiſtory for this account.</p>
               <p>THIS coaſt was equally infamous in the days of <hi>Pliny,</hi> poſſibly long before, even as long as commerce became conſiderable in theſe ſeas. In lib. vi. c. 23, he warns the <hi>Roman</hi> merchants of the dangers of this route, from touching at <hi>Muziris,</hi> not only becauſe it is not abundant in articles of commerce, but as it borders upon the <hi>Piratae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">HYDRAS.</note> who had a port at <hi>Hydras,</hi> ſome write it <hi>Nitrias;</hi> yet I think the hiſtorian intended the firſt, alluſive to the fabled ſerpent which makes every thing its prey. Their ports of this coaſt are truly deſcribed by <hi>Pliny</hi> to be ſhallow,

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0792500101:127"/>ſo that the commerce was then carried on, as it is in many places to this day, in ſmall boats, which convey the merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to the ſhips, which are obliged to anchor at a diſtance from land. <hi>Ptolemy</hi> alſo mentions the ports of theſe pirates, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and gives a lift of them. It is not improbable, but that theſe peſts of the ſea continued from that time to the preſent: but certain it is, that <hi>Vaſco de Gama</hi> found them on this coaſt in full force, in his firſt voyage to <hi>India. Marco Polo,</hi> who travelled in 1269, deſcribes, at p. 145, their piracies in thoſe days, both in the ſeas of <hi>Guzerat</hi> and <hi>Malabar.</hi> He ſays they took their wives and children with them, and paſſed the whole ſummer on the ſea. They commonly had twenty ſhips in a fleet, which they ranged at the diſtance of five miles from each other, making a line of a hundred miles. As ſoon as any one deſcribed a merchant ſhip it made a ſignal, by ſmoke, to the reſt; ſo there was no poſſibility of eſcape. They offered no violence to the crew; they only plundered the veſſel, and ſet the people on ſhore.</p>
               <p>IN our days many of the ports of the modern pirates have been brought into notice, by the attempts to extirpate theſe neſts of thieves, and with a temporary ſucceſs. Their principal faſtneſſes were in <hi>Victoria, Severn-droog, Sunderdoo, Vingorla</hi> rocks, in Lat. 15° 22′ 30″, ſix or ſeven miles from the ſhore; and I ſhould have given particular pre-eminence to <hi>Gheriah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">GHERIAH.</note> the port of the chief pirate <hi>Angria,</hi> nearly midway between <hi>Bombay</hi> and <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Victoria</hi> is the name we beſtowed on one of theſe faſtneſſes. The <hi>Indian</hi> one was <hi>Bancoote.</hi> This we retain, not only becauſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0792500101:128"/>it has a good harbour, and great trade in ſalt, but becauſe the neighborhood abounds with cattle, with which we can ſupply the garriſon and navy at <hi>Bombay.</hi> The country is peopled with <hi>Mahomctans,</hi> who have no ſcruple to part with them, as the <hi>Hindoos</hi> have

               <p>THE important city of <hi>Goa</hi> ſtands on an iſland of the ſame name,
<note place="margin">ISLE OF GOA.</note> in Lat. 15° 28′ 20″, in a fine bay, a few leagues lower. The city was for a great length of time the moſt magnificent in <hi>India.</hi> The churches and palaces of the inhabitants were of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0792500101:131"/>great grandeur and ſplendor. It ſtands elevated, in form of an amphitheatre, on the banks of a moſt beautiful bay. The country riſes gently into hills, finely wooded, and the ſcene is varied with churches, convents, and villas, and the diſtance bounded by the <hi>Ghauts,</hi> ſoaring with aweful majeſty. The <hi>Algoada</hi> fort defends the entrance on the northern ſide. All this is ſhewn in Mr. <hi>Dalrymple</hi>'s elegant views. Two rivers flow from the <hi>Balagat</hi> mountains, and their mouths nearly meet oppoſite to the harbour. On one, which was called the <hi>Ganges,</hi> a few leagues from the ſea, ſtood the <hi>Nelcynda.

               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Indian</hi> name of <hi>Goa</hi> was <hi>Tricurii,</hi> or the iſle of <hi>Thirty Villages;</hi> it is ſaid to have been peopled by <hi>Mooriſh</hi> merchants, who had been baniſhed from different ports of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and formed ſoon a very flouriſhing ſettlement. This is ſaid to have happened at no very diſtant period before the arrival of the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN the great <hi>Albuquerque</hi> entered on his vice-royalty,
<note place="margin">SEIZED BY ALBU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUERQUE.</note> it was a moſt opulent place, and ſtrongly fortified. It was at that time ſubject to <hi>Zabaim,</hi> a potent monarch, who was then engaged in war with divers tributary princes. <hi>Timoia,</hi> a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring pirate, who had ſubmitted to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> ſtrongly adviſed the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> General to ſeize the opportunity of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Goa,</hi> repreſenting its great opulence, and the honor and wealth that would attend his ſucceſs. <hi>Albuquerque</hi> liſtened to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0792500101:132"/>his advice, and after ſeveral aſſaults made himſelf maſter of the city by an agreement with the inhabitants. This happened on <hi>February</hi> 16, 1510. The citizens took the oaths of allegiance to <hi>Emmanuel;</hi> he found in the place immenſe quantities of ammunition, forty great cannon, and in the docks forty men of war, and in the ſtables numbers of fine <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> horſes
<note n="*" place="bottom">Oſorio, ii. p. 4.</note>. He himſelf reſided in the royal palace: the fame of his valor and prudence ſpread far and wide. He received em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies from ſeveral of the <hi>Indian</hi> monarchs, and even was encouraged to ſend an envoy to the ſophy of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unfortuately a mutinous ſpirit pervaded his army, and even his principal officers. This naturally infected his new ſubjects, who, repenting their diſloyalty, and diſguſted with their ſudden ſubmiſſion to a foreign and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> yoke, conveyed their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to their late ſovereign. He aſſembled a mighty army on the continent, and notwithſtanding every endeavor of the able <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> effected a landing on the iſland. The <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> defended themſelves with great valor, but finding the place no longer tenable, their commander determined to retire. He embarked with great ſecrecy every thing that was neceſſary; when, on the 30th of <hi>May</hi> of the ſame year, after a ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, he made good his retreat to <hi>Rapander,</hi> a neighboring town, where he reſolved to winter
<note n="†" place="bottom">Oſorio, ii. p. 13.</note>. <hi>Zabaim</hi> proved a brave and active enemy: <hi>Albuquerque</hi> was more than once obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his quarters: at length, receiving a ſtrong reinforcement of <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and other ſupplies, he renewed his attempt on <hi>Goa,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0792500101:133"/>and, after ſeveral ſharp actions, made himſelf again maſter of the city, by a moſt fierce and bloody aſſault; the defence being equally obſtinate as the attack.</p>
               <p>FROM that moment the able Vice-roy determined to make <hi>Goa</hi> the capital of his maſter's new acquired dominion in <hi>India:</hi> he gave it every ſtrength his military ſkill could ſuggeſt, and every encouragement that his wiſdom and commercial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege could invent. The ſucceſs was, for a long ſeries of years, equal to the greatneſs of the deſign, and it flouriſhed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivalled ſplendor. It became the center of the riches of <hi>India,</hi> and one of the greateſt marts in the univerſe. At length the common conſequences of wealth, pride, luxury, effeminacy, and every ſpecies of fraud, cruelty, and oppreſſion poſſeſſed the minds of theſe once brave and gallant people; they degenerated into every vile action; and thought nothing wrong that brought in advantage. They eſtabliſhed here an inquiſition to enſlave the minds of the people. They perſecuted the poor natives in every ſhape, and in every place. The Abbe <hi>Raynal,</hi> in moſt animated terms, deſcribes the ſad change. To him I refer the reader. After the fall of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> empire in <hi>India,</hi> a prieſt of <hi>Goa</hi> being aſked, when he thought his nation might again reſume its power, ſenſibly replied—"As ſoon as your wickedneſs ſhall exceed that of my people." Let me only ſay, that the meaſure of their iniquity being filled, they were beaten, and expelled from the very ſeats conquered by the intrepidity and chivalry of their anceſtors; and that by a ſmall nation, who, ſallying from the fens of <hi>Holland,</hi> by temperance, wiſdom, and fortitude, drove from almoſt every part of <hi>India</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0792500101:134"/>that nation, whoſe monarchs ſo long had tyranniſed over them in <hi>Europe. Goa,</hi> and ſome few places on the <hi>Malabar</hi> coaſt, were left to them. Moſt of them are now deſerted, and fallen to ruin. <hi>Goa</hi> barely keeps up its head: a Vice-roy, a man of rank, is ſtill ſent here; a ſhew of ſtate is kept up, but nothing of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory is left, except the iſland, and the two peninſulas that form the harbour. The port of <hi>Goa</hi> is one of the fineſt in <hi>India,</hi> and in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> would be a wealthy and flouriſhing ſettlement; but its commercial conſequence is ſunk to nothing: and ſuch is the ſtate of <hi>Diu</hi> and <hi>Damoon</hi> if they ſtill remain in their hands.</p>

               <p>AT <hi>Mangalore</hi> the General received intelligence, that <hi>Tippoo</hi> was in full march from the <hi>Carnatic</hi> to relieve his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Notwithſtanding his ſituation, the avarice of the General overcame every conſideration. He ordered the officers to make unlimited drafts on the paymaſter, who had before been greatly exhauſted by various contrivances. It was currently believed, that he had ſent by his brother to <hi>Goa,</hi> three hundred thouſand pounds, and a great quantity of diamonds, to be remitted to <hi>Bombay;</hi> and that, even on the point of his departure, he had cauſed the <hi>bamboos</hi> of his <hi>palanquin</hi> to be pierced, and filled with <hi>pagodas.</hi> When <hi>Tippoo</hi> examined the ſtate of his treaſury, he grew enraged at this infamous fraud; he declared the treaty void: put the officers and their <hi>Sepoys,</hi> faithful to them to the laſt, indiſcriminately in irons, and marched them in that condition, in a burning ſun, to priſons at <hi>Scringapatam</hi> and other places.

               <p>ALL this tract was, in <hi>Arrian</hi>'s time, noted for its rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and great commerce, particularly in the article pepper. The <hi>Piper cottonaricum</hi> was famous in all parts, but the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian limits the growth to one ſpot. The country was far from being confined to that ſingle article: It ſupplied the merchants with numbers of the fineſt pearls,

This trade is probably continued, to the preſent day, to the <hi>emporia</hi> of <hi>Tartary.</hi> When <hi>Anthonie Jenkinſon</hi> was at <hi>Bochara,</hi> in 1558, the <hi>Indian</hi> caravans brought great quantities of this ſpecies of linen, which was much uſed by the <hi>Tartars</hi> to form their head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,

                  <note place="margin">NARDUS.</note> from a certain part of <hi>India</hi> called <hi>Gapana,</hi> is another article of commerce. The <hi>Nardus</hi> was in high repute in former times, but now is out of faſhion. It was much uſed in form of a pomatum, with which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> perfumed their hair. <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks of it frequently, on feſtive occcaſions, and in one exemplifies the antient cuſtom of bringing their pretious ointments in a box of <hi>Onyx</hi> or <hi>Alabaſtrites:</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Malebathrum</hi> was another valuable drug from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. xii. c. 12, and lib. xiii. c. 1,
<note place="margin">MALEBATHRUM.</note> ſpeaks highly of it as a perfume, in which it ſeems to have been an ingredient among many others. The <hi>Unguentum Regale</hi> was compoſed of not fewer than twenty-ſix.

                  <hi>Pliny</hi> gives a very long liſt of the perſumes uſed by the <hi>Romans.</hi> They were moſtly pomatums, and conſequently not the moſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0792500101:155"/>delicate. The variety was endleſs, and ſome of the ingredients would ſeem now very ſingular. They anointed themſelves with ſome kinds, to ſuppreſs the rank ſmell of their bodies, and often to prevent the effects of their intemperance and exceſs in meats and drinks, being too ſenſibly perceived. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> ſay, that the vegetable which yielded this perfume was a certain water-plant, that floated on the ſurface, like what we call duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. <hi>Gerard,</hi> p. 1534, called it <hi>Talapatra,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> leaf, and gives the figure of a ſhrub, related to the clove.</p>

               <p>THE imports here (for it is well to know the antient wants of the country) were,

               <p>THE ſituation of the town is extremely beautiful; backed by hills finely broken, and wooded, interſperſed with valleys, and watered by a fine river; but its extreme healthineſs is a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation beyond all other beauties: it is equal to that of <hi>England,</hi> and is, on that account, the great reſort of invalids.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Betela-codi, Rheede, v. tab. 16.</note>. The nuts are uſually of the ſize of a hen's egg: they are therefore broken and prepared for chewing, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the bitter leaf of the <hi>Betel,</hi> mixed with <hi>Chunan,</hi> or ſhell lime, and in that form taken all over <hi>India</hi> by people of every age, ſex, and condition. <hi>Rumphius,</hi> i. p. 32, is moſt particular about the uſe, and the great pomp and ceremony with which the <hi>Indian</hi> monarchs beſtow it on the embaſſadors they receive from foreign ſtates. It is the compliment of the country to offer this at viſits, or whereſoever people meet: it is an emblem of peace and friendſhip, is ſuppoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilarate the ſpirits, to ſtrengthen the ſtomachs (but at the expence of the teeth), and is particularly in repute with ladies of intrigue, as it is ſuppoſed to improve the powers of love.

The firſt is intended to conciliate the affection of their lovers, a practice in all ages and in all countries. They are even ſaid to poſſeſs the powers of changing affections, to diſſolve that between man and wife, and tranſfer them to other objects. They are next uſed as means of revenge, for the <hi>ſpretae injuria formae.</hi> They are ſaid to be capable of preparing the nuts in ſuch a manner, as to bring on the offending parties the completeſt imbecility; or, if they prefer another mode of revenge, death itſelf, lingering, and diſtant; even to any time theſe demoniac fair chuſe. The lover falls into an atrophy, and waſtes away in the claſſical manner, deſcribed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> when the waxen image was made the fatal incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Rumphius</hi> records the <hi>Indian</hi> tales, and ſeems to believe them.

               <p>IT is endleſs to enumerate the plants or trees of <hi>India;</hi> the knowledge of its vegetable kingdom can only be learned from the number of books expreſſly written on the ſubject; yet, in the courſe of this topography, I ſhall incidentally give a brief account of the moſt ſingular, or the moſt uſeful.

                  <note place="margin">BAMBOO REED.</note> a reed which is found frequent in the country. It is the retreat of tigers, panthers, bears, and other beaſts of prey; and the haunt of infinite numbers and varieties of the monkey tribe. Botaniſts ſtyle it <hi>Arundo Bambos,</hi> and <hi>Arundo arbor;</hi> it is an evergreen. The ſtem is of a vivid green, but as it grows older, becomes of a duller color. I refer to the <hi>Syſlema Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> for the ſynonyms. <hi>Rumphius,</hi> iv. 8, deſcribes, but does not give its figure. In the <hi>Hortus Malaharicus,</hi> i. tab. 16, it is found under the title of <hi>Ily. Bamboo</hi> is not the <hi>Indian</hi> name, but one impoſed on it by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> from the violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion the hollows give on being ſet on fire, occaſioned by the confined air, little inferior to that of a piece of artillery. This plant grows to a prodigious height, ſo as to over-top all trees of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0792500101:164"/>the foreſt; and its circumference ſo great, as to occaſion hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical exaggeration. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, that the joints of thoſe which grew about the <hi>Aceſines,</hi> are ſo large, that a ſingle one is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to make a boat.
<q>Navigiorum etiam vicem praeſtant (ſi credimus) ſingula internodia.</q> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> ſeems to credit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and <hi>Acoſta,</hi> (Aromatum liber) an author of credit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that he had frequently ſeen them in uſe on the river, near <hi>Cranganor,</hi> on this coaſt, and that they were capable of carrying two <hi>Indians;</hi> one ſate on each end, with their knees joined, and each carried a ſhort oar, or paddle, with which they rowed with vaſt rapidity, and even againſt the ſtream. The honorable <hi>Edward Monkton,</hi> who had been at <hi>Goa,</hi> has aſſured me, that the above muſt have been a miſtake. The largeſt joint he ever ſaw (which always grows at the bottom of the plant) was not two feet in length, and about the thickneſs of a ſtout man's leg.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>bamboo</hi> is ſubſervient to other uſes ſimilar, but far more important. The reed, formed into a frame, and covered with ſkin, becomes a boat of the ſame ſort with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> coracles, or rather the <hi>vitilia navigia,</hi> in which the <hi>Britons</hi> even croſſed our narrow ſeas

<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſt. of Ayder Alli, i. 116.</note>. As to the horſes, they ſwim by the ſide of the coracle, held by the horſeman (who is in the boat) by the bridle, in the ſame

               <p>IT is pretended, that theſe canes are ſo diſliked by the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, that they never ſeize on the navigators, as the ſharks in <hi>Greenland</hi> do on the poor <hi>Greenlanders,</hi> whom they bite in two, ſecured as they ſeem to be, in their canoes.</p>
               <p>IN moſt places, the joints are uſed as pitchers to carry water, and ſome will contain ſufficient to ſupply the family for the whole day. From this uſe it is named the <hi>Arundarbor Vaſaria.</hi>

               <p>THEY are often made uſe of for frames of houſes, for which their ready ſiſſibility, and their lightneſs, peculiarly adapt them.</p>
               <p>THEY are greatly ſearched after, as poles to carry burthens, but particularly for the poles of <hi>Palanquins;</hi> for this purpoſe they are bent while growing, to give them a proper curvature; and when richly carved, as they often are, are ſold at a vaſt

               <p>THIS reed is alſo called <hi>Mambu,</hi> and was celebrated in early times by the <hi>Arabian</hi> phyſicians, for producing from its joints a ſort of inſpiſſated juice, of a ſweet taſte, called <hi>Tabaxar,</hi>

It was a famed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine with all the <hi>Orientaliſts,</hi> in outward and inward heats, bilious fevers, and other diſorders of that nature, and in dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; and it was reckoned peculiarly efficacious in diſcharges of coagulated blood, ſo frequently left in internal wounds. Theſe uſes made it once a great article of export from the <hi>Malabar</hi> ports. The <hi>Brahmins</hi> alſo uſe this <hi>Sacar</hi> in their medical preſcriptions.</p>
               <p>IN this hot country, the reed is often applied to another uſe, adapted to refreſh the exhauſted native; it is bent ſo as to form arbours and cool walks of conſiderable length, delicious retreats from the rays of the vertical ſun.

               <p>SUGAR was originally brought from <hi>India,</hi>

"<hi>Arabia,</hi>" ſays <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. xii. c. 8, "produces <hi>Sacearon,</hi> but the beſt is in <hi>India.</hi>" It is a honey <q>collected from reeds, a ſort of white gum, brittle between the teeth: the largeſt pieces do not exceed the ſize of a hazel nut, and it is uſed only in medicine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE cane was an article of commerce in very early times. <note place="margin">ANTIQUITY OF.</note>The prophets <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ch. xlv. 24.</note>and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>

In the note on the elegant poem, the <hi>Sugar</hi> Cane <note n="‡" place="bottom">Note in Book ix. 22.</note>, Doctor <hi>Grainger</hi> informs us, that at firſt the raw juice was made uſe of; they afterwards boiled it into a ſyrup, and, in proceſs of time, an inebriating ſpirit was prepared therefrom, by fermentation.</p>
               <p>SUGAR was firſt made from the reed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ITS REMOVALS.</note> from thence the plant was carried into <hi>Sicily,</hi> which, in the twelfth century, ſupplied many parts of <hi>Europe</hi> with that commodity; and from thence, at a period unknown, it was probably brought into <hi>Spain,</hi> by the <hi>Moors.</hi> From <hi>Spain</hi> the reed was planted in the <hi>Canary</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0792500101:168"/>iſlands, and in the <hi>Madeira,</hi> by the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> This happened about the year 1506. In the ſame year, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic ordered the cane to be carried from the <hi>Canaries</hi> to St. <hi>Domingo.</hi> From thoſe iſlands the art of making ſugar was introduced into the iſlands of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and in about the year 1623 into the <hi>Brazils;</hi> the reed itſelf growing ſpontaneouſly in both thoſe countries. Till that time ſugar was a moſt expenſive luxury, and uſed only, as Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi> obſerves, in feaſts, and phyſical neceſſities.</p>
               <p>I SHALL here anticipate the account of the ſtate of ſugar in <hi>Spain,</hi> where in <hi>Europe</hi> it firſt became ſtationary, <note place="margin">INTO SPAIN.</note> borrowing it from the ninth volume of my Outlines of the Globe. It was, till of late years, cultivated to great advantage in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and great quantities of ſugar made in the <hi>ingenios,</hi> or mills. In the year 1723, in the city of <hi>Meſril,</hi> were eight hundred families: Their principal commerce was in ſugars and ſyrups, made in four ſugar works, from the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of canes, which reached from the ſouth ſide down to the ſea ſide; but theſe and the other ſugar works are greatly decayed, by reaſon of the exceſſive duties. This, with the increaſed demand for ſugar, on the prevaling uſe of chocolate in the kingdom, which requires double the quantity of that article, has occaſioned a drain of a million of dollars out of the country, in payment for ſugar, preſerves, and other confec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaries. This is very extraordinary, conſidering that <hi>Spain</hi> is poſſeſſed of ſome of the ſineſt ſugar iſlands, beſides the power of manufacturing it within its home dominions <note n="*" place="bottom">Uztariz, ii. ch. 94.</note>.</p>
               <p>I NOW digreſs ſeveral leagues to the weſt, <note place="margin">LACCADIVE ISLES.</note> to the <hi>Laccadive</hi> iſles, a conſiderable group, the centre of which is nearly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0792500101:169"/>to <hi>Tellicherry.</hi> They extend from Lat. 10° to 12° 50′ north, are low, and not to be ſeen farther than ſix or ſeven leagues. Theſe are ſuppoſed to be the iſles intended by <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> by the title of <hi>Inſulae Numero</hi> XIX. but, in fact, they are thirty-two, all of them ſmall, and covered with trees, and rocky on their ſides, moſtly as if laid on a bottom of ſand, attended with reefs, and the channels between them are very deep. They are commonly navigated by our ſhips, in their way to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulph, or the <hi>Red</hi> Sea. That called the ix½ degree channel, or the paſſage between the moſt ſouthern of the <hi>Laccadives,</hi> the iſle of <hi>Malique,</hi> and that called <hi>Mamala,</hi> or the viii. degree channel, between the iſle of <hi>Malique,</hi> and the moſt northern of the <hi>Maldive</hi> iſles, are thoſe which are in uſe. Each iſland has its name: Captain <hi>Cornwal</hi> ſays, that called <hi>Calpenia</hi> has a river, where ſhips of two hundred tons may float and clean.</p>
               <p>THE principal traffic of theſe iſles, is in the products of the coco trees, ſuch as the oil, the cables, and cordage; and in fiſh, which is dried and ſent to the continent of <hi>India,</hi> from whence they get rice, &amp;c. in return. They alſo trade to <hi>Maſcat,</hi> in large boats, and carry there the ſame commodities, and bring back dry and wet dates, <note place="margin">AMBERGRISE.</note> and a little coffee. Ambergriſe is found often, floating off theſe iſles. <hi>Hamilton</hi> mentions a piece in poſſeſſion of a certain <hi>Rajah,</hi> valued at £.1,250 ſterling. It is now generally ſuppoſed to be a mineral; <hi>Cronſted,</hi> at leſt, ranks it among them: the beſt is of a grey color, is a ſtrong perfume, and is alſo much uſed in medicine. It is highly eſteemed as a cordial, and in nervous complaints; and, in extremities, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered often as a perſuaſive to the ſoul not to quit its earthly tenement.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0792500101:170"/>A Captain <hi>Coffin,</hi> engaged in the ſouthern or <hi>Guinea</hi> whale fiſhery, found in a female ſpermaceti whale, three hundred and ſixty ounces of ambergriſe. This is ſaid not to be unuſual, but then it always is in fickly emaciated fiſhes. Theſe inſtances do not prove that it was the production of the ſpermaceti whale, the food of which is <hi>ſquids,</hi> or the <hi>ſepia:</hi> many of the horny beaks were found adhering to the ambergriſe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in that ſoft ſubſtance. It appears to me, that the whales ſometimes ſwallow it, that it diſagrees with them, and acts as a ſort of poiſon, bringing on a decay, and death; and that the parts of the <hi>ſepia</hi> found lodged in it, are the undiſſolved remains lodged in the ambergriſe. Mr. <hi>Coſſin</hi> ſold his prize at nineteen ſhillings and nine pence per ounce. This is related in Phil. Tranſ. lxxxi. p. 43.</p>

               <p>THEY are divided into thirteen <hi>Attollons,</hi> or provinces, and are governed by one king; but each <hi>Attollon</hi> has its particular governor, who rules with great oppreſſion.

Here the great <hi>Gama,</hi> on <hi>May</hi> 18, 1698, firſt ſaw the fertile riſings and plains of <hi>Malabar,</hi> backed by the lofty <hi>Ghauts,</hi> riſe before him.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0792500101:175"/>is, and, in reſpect to its natural ſituation, what it muſt have been at that time. The works of art are too minute to be perceptible, amidſt the bold and eternal operations of nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calicut</hi> was at that time the greateſt <hi>emporium</hi> of all <hi>India.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ITS ANTIENT TRADE.</note> The commerce of the <hi>Arabs</hi> with this port was prodigious. Pretious ſtones, pearls, amber, ivory, <hi>China</hi>-ware, gold and ſilver, ſilks and cottons, indigo, ſugar, ſpices, valuable woods, perfumes, beautiful varniſhes, and whatever adds to the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life, were brought there from all parts of the eaſt. Some of theſe rich commodities came by ſea; but as navigation was neither ſo ſafe, nor purſued with ſo much ſpirit as it hath been ſince, a great part of them was conveyed by land, on the backs of oxen and elephants.</p>
               <p>ALL its ſplendor and all its opulence was owing to commerce, yet the houſes were mean, but not crowded, detached from each other, and ſurrounded with delicious gardens; none were built of ſtone, but the royal palace, which roſe with great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence above the other buildings. The town was very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and very populous.</p>
               <p>AT the arrival of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> it was governed by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, <note place="margin">THE ZAMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REEN.</note> called the <hi>Zamorin,</hi> who, like a lord paramount, had all the other princes of <hi>Malabar</hi> as tributaries. The account, as related by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> hiſtorians, is, that ſix hundred years before the arrival of <hi>Gama,</hi> or about the year 898, <hi>Perimal</hi> reigned ſupreme over the whole country.

                  <hi>Gama</hi> was at firſt well received at <hi>Calicut,</hi> but the jealouſy of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> prevented his friendſhip with the <hi>Zamorin</hi> from being of any duration.

               <p>THIS city was diſtinguiſhed by two moſt remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
<note place="margin">JEWS IN INDIA.</note> the one (to begin with the moſt antient) was its having been the reſidence of a republic of <hi>Jews,</hi> part of the tribe of <hi>Manaſſch,</hi> who had been carried into captivity by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> who ſent numbers of them to this diſtant place. Their hiſtory ſays, that they amounted to twenty thouſand, and that they were three years in travelling to this place, from the time of their ſetting out from <hi>Babylon.</hi> When they arrived they were treated with great humanity by the natives, and allowed every indulgence in both religious and temporal concerns. In proceſs of time, they grew ſo wealthy as to purchaſe the little kingdom of <hi>Cranganore. Hamilton,</hi> i, p. p. 321, 322, makes them increaſe to eighty thouſand families, but in his days they were reduced to four thouſand. They eſtabliſhed a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and ſelected the two ſons of one of the firſt families, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their wiſdom, to govern them jointly. One of them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated by ambition, murdered his brother: after which the commonwealth became a democracy; and their territory, many centuries ago, returned into the hands of the natives. Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as they were, they are at preſent very poor, and few. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them had removed to <hi>God,</hi> where they were greatly encouraged by the <hi>Zamorin</hi> of the time. They have to this

He firſt viſited the iſle of <hi>Socotora;</hi> after performing the orders of his Divine Maſter, he paſſed through the ſeveral kingdoms which intervened between that iſle and <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> From <hi>Socotora</hi> he landed at <hi>Cranganore,</hi> where he continued ſome time, and made numbers of proſelytes, and, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, eſtabliſhed a church government.

I have not extent of faith to favour the legend of the place of the martyrdom of the ſaint, which was fixed by pious hiſtorians to have been at St. <hi>Thomas</hi> on the <hi>Coromandel</hi> coaſt; of which the reader will find an account in the following vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
               <p>THE rites and cuſtoms of theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> differ in ſeveral reſpects from thoſe of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">THEIR RITES.</note> In ſome they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which makes me imagine there might have been ſome accidented communication of the nature of that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above. <hi>Oſorio,</hi> i. 212, gives an account of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Speaking of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Cranganore,</hi> he thus goes on—<q>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who reſide here, are generally very poor, and their churches of a mean appearance. They keep the ſabbath in the ſame manner as we do, in hearing ſermons, and performing other religious duties. The high prieſt, whom
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0792500101:187"/>they acknowleged as the head of their church, had his ſeat near ſome mountains, towards the north, in a country called <hi>Chaldaeis.</hi> He has a council compoſed of twelve cardinals, two biſhops, and ſeveral prieſts: With the aſſiſtance of theſe, he ſettles all affairs relating to religion; and all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in theſe parts acquieſce in his decrees. The prieſts are ſhaved in ſuch a manner, as to repreſent a croſs on their crowns. They adminiſter the ſacrament in both kinds, making uſe of the juice of preſſed grapes, by way of wine, and allow the laity to partake of both; but no one is admitted to this ſolemn ordinance till he has made a confeſſion of his iniquities. They baptized not their infants till they were forty days old, except in danger of death. When any one amongſt them is ſeized with a fit of ſickneſs, the prieſt immediately viſits him, and the ſick perſon is greatly animated by the holy man's ſupplications. When they enter their churches, they ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle themſelves with holy water. They uſe the ſame form of burial as in other catholic countries: the relations of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed give great entertainments, which laſt a week, during which time they celebrate his praiſes, and put up prayers for his eternal happineſs. They preſerve the ſacred writings in the <hi>Syrian</hi> or <hi>Chaldaean</hi> language, with great carefulneſs; and their teachers are ready in all public places to inſtruct every one. They keep the <hi>Advent Sunday,</hi> and the forty days of <hi>Lent,</hi> with great ſtrictneſs, and obſerve moſt of the feſtivals which we have in our church, with the ſame exactneſs. They compute their time likewiſe in the ſame manner as we do, adding a day to every fourth year. The
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0792500101:188"/>firſt day of <hi>July</hi> is kept as a holiday, in honor of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> not only by theſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but many of the <hi>Pagans</hi> alſo. There are likewiſe convents for the prieſts, and nunneries for their women, who adhere to their vows of chaſtity with the utmoſt probity. Their prieſts are allowed to marry once, but excluded from taking a ſecond wife. Marriages amongſt other people cannot be annulled, but by the death of one of the parties. When a woman becomes a widow, ſhe forfeits her dowry if married within a twelve-month after the death of her huſband. Theſe are the cuſtoms and manners which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Cranganore,</hi> as well as many other parts of <hi>India,</hi> have obſerved with the utmoſt fidelity, from the time of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi>

               <p>WHEN <hi>Gama</hi> arrived on this coaſt, there were about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand of them in the ſouthern parts of <hi>Malabar;</hi> during thirteen hundred years they had been under the Patriarch of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who appointed their <hi>Metarene</hi> or Archbiſhop. They were extremely averſe to the doctrine of St. <hi>Francis de Xavier,</hi> when he came among them, and abhorred the worſhip of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which they conſidered as idolatry. They refuſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege the Pope's ſupremacy, and at length were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted as heretics, with all the horrors of the inquiſition, newly eſtabliſhed at <hi>Goa. Xavier</hi> had never troubled his new converts with any inſtruction, nor ever inſtilled into them any knowlege of the principles of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion, any farther than implicit obedience to the head of the church. He gave them crucifixes to worſhip, and told them, they were then ſure of heaven. His preaching was ſubſervient to the political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0792500101:189"/>of his country; his abilities, and his labors for that end were amazing. In him appeared all the powers which, in after times, gave to his order that vaſt importance in the affairs of the univerſe. I will conclude this article with ſaying, that out of the fifty thouſand inhabitants found in <hi>Bednore</hi> when <hi>Ayder Alli</hi> took poſſeſſion of it, thirty thouſand were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> "who," ſays his hiſtorian, i. p. 83,

                  <hi>Cranganore,</hi> and a fort on the oppoſite ſide of the river, named <hi>Jacotta,</hi> gave riſe to the important war of the <hi>Myſore.</hi> They had been taken from the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and poſſeſſed by the laſt a hundred and fifty years. <hi>Ayder Alli,</hi> ſeeing the conveniency of <hi>Cranganore</hi> to his <hi>Myſorean</hi> kingdom, in 1780, ſeized and garriſoned it. In the enſuing war, the <hi>Dutch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed themſelves of it. In 1789 <hi>Tippoo Sultan,</hi> the ſucceſſor of <hi>Ayder,</hi> determined to make himſelf maſter of it, in right of his father. He raiſed a mighty army, which ſo alarmed the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they reſolved to diſpoſe of the two forts to the <hi>Rajah</hi> of <hi>Travancore,</hi> an ally of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in order to divert the ſtorm from themſelves. <hi>Tippoo</hi> marched with his forces, and attacked the lines of <hi>Travancore.</hi> The battle between his army and that of the <hi>Rajah,</hi> the latter in defence of <hi>Cranganore,</hi> on <hi>May</hi> 1, 1790, was the ſignal of the general war, on which commenced the firſt campaign in <hi>June</hi> following. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that glorious war was the putting us in poſſeſſion of the whole coaſt, from <hi>Caroor</hi> as far as mount <hi>Dilly,</hi> a tract of a hundred and twenty miles.

<note place="margin">COCHIN.</note> 9° 58′ N. on the ſouthern ſide of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, on an iſland oppoſite to another that ſtretches to the ſouth. It is a <hi>Rajahſhip,</hi> poſſibly dependent on that of <hi>Travancore,</hi> who ſeems to have undertaken the defence of the whole tract ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by erecting the famous lines of <hi>Travancore,</hi> which begin at <hi>Cranganore</hi> and extend almoſt to the foot of the <hi>Ghauts.</hi> The coaſt is very low, ſcarcely diſcernible, except by the trees. The ſoundings are gradual, and are, at the diſtance of two miles from ſhore, ten or eleven fathoms. Ships uſually lie three or four miles from land; a dangerous bar is an obſtruction to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the harbour; and a moſt furious ſurge at times beats on the ſhore.</p>
               <p>THIS was one of the firſt places viſited by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> after their arrival at <hi>Calicut.</hi> It was at that time governed by a prince, tributary to the <hi>Zamorin,</hi> but who ſhewed every act of friendſhip to the Admiral, <hi>Cabral,</hi> and his companions. At his time the harbour was capacious and open. While he was there, two of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> came and requeſted him to convey them to <hi>Portugal,</hi> that from thence they might viſit <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Land.

The prince continued faithful to his new allies, and aſſiſted them with a conſiderable army againſt the <hi>Zamorin.</hi> At length fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt him; the <hi>Zamorin</hi> burnt his capital, and made himſelf maſter of his dominions. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> under <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Albuquerque,</hi> ſays <hi>Laſitau,</hi> came, in 1503, to their aſſiſtance, expelled the <hi>Zamorin,</hi> and <hi>Duarte Pachcco,</hi> whom <hi>Albuquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> had left behind, by his aſtoniſhing valor and prudence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtated

                  <hi>Triumpara,</hi> the reigning prince, but only to fit him for a new mortification. In the tranſports of his gratitude he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> to build a fort. This gave them full power over their faithful ally; and, under pretence of reducing his rebellious ſubjects, made a conqueſt of the whole country. In a little time the poor prince found himſelf enſlaved. <hi>Cochin</hi> became, under its new maſters, a place of great commerce, till the year 1660, fatal to the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> power in this part of <hi>India.</hi> It was attacked by the Commodore <hi>Goens.</hi> The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon made a moſt gallant defence, nor was it taken till after great loſs on both ſides. The <hi>Dutch</hi> found the city much too large for their purpoſe; they reduced it conſiderably. The titular king did not find any improvement in his ſituation, and it is ſaid, that the preſent prince lives near <hi>Cochin,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of little more than ſix hundred pounds a year. Some of the race of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> captives, and ſome of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> reſide here. The laſt are miſerably poor and ignorant; but the church of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> not far from hence, is ſerved by their clergy.</p>
               <p>IN this city breathed his laſt the great <hi>Vaſco de Gama,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">OF VASCO DE GAMA.</note> the diſcoverer of <hi>India,</hi> and, with the illuſtrious <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> the founder of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> empire in that inexhauſtible region of wealth. <hi>Gama</hi> was born at <hi>Sines,</hi> a port in the province of <hi>Alentejo,</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> of a family rendered illuſtrious by the valour of the individuals. <hi>Vaſco</hi> was only the fifth in heraldic hiſtory, which does not even acquaint us with the time of his birth. He had ſerved in <hi>France,</hi> and he was Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the great <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> when he was appointed, in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0792500101:192"/>1497, to the important command of the fleet deſtined for the diſcovery of the <hi>Indies.</hi> We have ſucceſſively mentioned his name, on ſeveral glorious occaſions; our buſineſs now is only to trace him to his end: He ſurvived to the reign of <hi>John</hi> III. to be appointed to a third voyage, and to finiſh his days on that ſhore, where he had begun his career of glory. He ſailed from <hi>Liſbon</hi> on <hi>April</hi> 10, 1524. Prodigies attended his voyage; on his arrival off the coaſt of <hi>Cambay,</hi> in the ſtillneſs of a calm, a dreadful ſwelling of the ſea, the then unknown ſymptons of an earthquake, appalled the boldeſt. <hi>Gama</hi> diſcovered the phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon: "Courage!" ſays he, "<hi>India</hi> trembles at our approach!" Another danger followed this. From the deſcription, his ſhip was nearly foundered by the fall of a water-ſpout. He arrived, at length, at this port, where he gave up his great ſoul, on <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 24, 1525, to be judged according to unerring juſtice; for, amidſt all his fine qualities, he was deeply tainted with the character of his nation, cruelty. His body lay depoſited at <hi>Cochin</hi> till 1538, when it was brought to <hi>Liſbon,</hi> where it was received with greater honor than was ever before paid to any perſon, excepting thoſe of the blood royal.</p>

He directed his pilot to ſteer for <hi>Goa,</hi> the ſcene of many of his glorious actions. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the way that he was recalled, and two perſons, moſt diſagreeable to him, were to ſucceed to the government of <hi>India.</hi> "<hi>Lopez Soarez,</hi>" exclamed he,

<note place="margin">KINGDOM OF TRAYANCORE.</note> from that of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganore,</hi> as far as this headland, a hundred and forty miles. In 1730 it began to riſe into importance, by the abilities of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who reigned forty years. In giving audience to two embaſſadors, whom he foreſaw would weary him with prolix harangues, he cut the firſt ſhort with this ſenſible remark; "<hi>Be not tedious,</hi>" ſays he, "<hi>life is ſhort.</hi>" He raiſed a fine army, and well diſciplined, and meditated the conqueſt of <hi>Malabar.</hi> Amidſt all his great talents, he mingled the weakneſs of being aſhamed of his <hi>caſt</hi> or <hi>tribe.</hi> He wiſhed to be a <hi>Brahmin;</hi> he ordered a golden calf to be made, he entered at the mouth, and came out at the oppoſite part; this was his <hi>Metempſychoſis;</hi> and he dated all his edicts from the days, ſays Abbé <hi>Raynal,</hi> of this glorious regeneration.</p>
               <p>THIS kingdom begins in Lat. 10° 18′, near <hi>Cranganore.</hi> The breadth is greatly contracted, by reaſon of the approach of the <hi>Ghauts</hi> towards the ſhore. Interſected by rivers, and covered with thick woods, it ſeems almoſt unconquerable. The <hi>Rajah,</hi> whom I have mentioned, gave his country ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſtrength, by which he ſaved his ſucceſſor from the oppreſſion of the riſing uſurper, <hi>Ayder Alli.</hi>
                  <q>Around his capital, and chief province,</q> ſays the author of the War in <hi>Aſia,</hi> i. p. 266,
<q>he ſuffered the woods to grow for a number of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0792500101:198"/>years, till they formed an impenetrable belt of great depth. This, cut into labyrinths, afforded eaſy egreſs to his people, and rendered all attacks from without impracticable. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured within this natural fortification, he encouraged the cultivation of the arts and ſciences: he invited the approach of men of genius and knowledge; he cultivated the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Brahmins,</hi> and was himſelf admitted into their ſociety, by the ceremony of paſſing, (as <hi>Raynel</hi> ſays) through a golden cow, which became the property of the <hi>Brahmins,</hi> the cow being ſacred in <hi>India,</hi> as formerly in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and by preparing his own military ſtores, caſting cannon, making gunpowder, &amp;c. he rendered himſelf independent of foreign aid. The ſubjects of his remoter provinces, who, to avoid the ravages of war, had taken refuge within the woody circle, now returned with their families and effects to their former habitations.</q> This mode of fortification he evidently copied from his wild neighbors, the <hi>Polygars;</hi> but they live in almoſt a ſavage ſtate, while he adopted their plan to ſecure the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mild arts of peace!</p>
               <p>EVEN the approach to this difficult retreat was impeded by the famous lines of <hi>Travancore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LINES OF TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANCORE.</note> which extend from the fouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern banks of the river of <hi>Cranganore,</hi> cloſe to ſea, to the foot of the <hi>Ghauts,</hi> ſtrongly fortified in their whole extent: Theſe proved the firſt check to the ambition of <hi>Tippoo Sultan.</hi> He wiſhed to provoke the <hi>Rajah</hi> to begin hoſtilities, in order that he might not be charged with being aggreſſor. For ſeveral days, from the 23d to the 28th of <hi>December</hi> 1789, the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s horſemen rode up to the <hi>Rajah</hi>'s lines, and made uſe of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0792500101:199"/>every inſulting expedient to draw the firſt act of hoſtility from the <hi>Travancore</hi> troops; but finding them aware of his artifice, and that a detachment of <hi>Engliſh</hi> troops was ſtationed at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he at laſt gave way to his rage, and on the 29th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> attacked the lines by ſtorm. His troops had filled the foſs with cotton. They paſſed by that means into the interior of the lines, when, by ſome accident, the cotton took fire, and the whole formed a tremendous blaze. In their rear were the flames; in front a furious enemy. Actuated by deſpair, they fought with incredible valour: out of fifteen hundred men, only forty were taken, the reſt fell victims to the rage of the <hi>Travan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corian</hi> defendants

               <p>FROM Cape <hi>Comorin</hi> I take my departure for the iſland of <hi>Ceylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ISLE OF CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENTYN.</note> the neareſt part of which, the iſle of <hi>Calpentyn,</hi> is about a hundred and fifty miles diſtant. The intervening ſea is the gulph of <hi>Manaar,</hi> which grows narrower and narrower till it reaches the fragments of the prior junction with the continent, of which Cape <hi>Koiel,</hi> a large promontory of the <hi>Marawars,</hi> and various rocks, are parts. The Cape will be deſcribed in my progreſs from Cape <hi>Comorin</hi> along the eaſtern coaſts of <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooſtan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEFORE <hi>Cape Koiel</hi> is the <hi>inſula-ſolis</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. vi. 22,
<note place="margin">RAMANA KOIEL.</note> the iſle of <hi>Ramana Koiel,</hi> or the iſle of the temple of the god <hi>Rama,</hi> founded near the edge of the water, and on vaſt ſtones, to break the force of that element. <hi>Rama</hi> had a right to a temple oppoſite to <hi>Ceylon,</hi> for he killed the giant <hi>Ravanen,</hi> king of that iſland, and placed his brother, <hi>Vibouchanen,</hi> on the throne. <hi>Rama</hi> was highly venerated in this country. The capital of the <hi>Marawars,</hi> and the reſidence of the prince, was named, in honor of the deity, <hi>Ramana-dabaram.</hi> The paſſage between this iſland and the continent is called <hi>Odioroa</hi> paſſage. It is extremely ſhort, about five miles broad, and not exceeding in depth three feet.</p>
               <p>FROM the eaſtern end of the iſle of <hi>Ramana Koiel,</hi> is a chain of rocks which runs quite acroſs the narrow channel to the iſle
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0792500101:204"/>of <hi>Manaar,</hi> almoſt adjacent to the <hi>Ceyloneſe</hi> ſhore: the length is about thirty miles, but the whole chain is frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by narrow paſſages, ſo very ſhallow, ſays <hi>d'Apres,</hi> in his <hi>Neptune Oriental,</hi> p. 85, as to be navigable only by the ſmall craſt of the neighboring ſhore, and that only in calm weather, ſo diſturbed is the channel in gales by a dreadful ſurf. The little veſſels that wiſh to make the paſſage, go under <hi>Manaar,</hi> where they muſt unload, pay duty to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> get their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel dragged through the paſs, and take in their cargo on the other ſide. It is very probable, that this ſucceſſion of rocks was part of an iſthmus, which in very early times had united <hi>Ceylon</hi> and the continent; for the water on each ſide of this chain, does not exceed thirteen or fourteen feet. <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the paſſage before cited, takes notice of the greeniſh caſt of this part of the channel, of its being filled with ſhrubs, that is, with corals; and of its being ſo ſhallow, that the rowers often bruſhed off the tops with their oars.</p>
               <p>THIS chain of rocks is called <hi>Adam's Bridge;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ADAM'S BRIDGE.</note> the tradition is, that our common father, after his tranſgreſſion, was caſt down from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and fell upon <hi>Ceylon;</hi> but that afterwards, this bridge was made by angels for him to paſs over to the continent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manaar</hi> is, as the name implies, ſandy. The little channel is on the eaſtern ſide, and defended by a ſtrong fort, garriſoned with a hundred men, notwithſtanding it is impaſſable for any veſſels which draw more than four or five feet water. It had on it ſeven churches, built by the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> The natives were converted by St. <hi>Francis de Xavier,</hi> and ſtill continue profeſſors
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0792500101:205"/>of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> notwithſtanding they have labored under many perſecutions. The pearl muſſel is found in great abundance on this coaſt, and the fiſhery has, at different times, been attended with good ſucceſs, ſince the <hi>Dutch</hi> have become maſters. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, that the greateſt plenty were found in his days on the coaſts of <hi>Tabrohana,</hi> and <hi>Toidis,</hi> and <hi>Perimula,</hi> on the peninſula of <hi>Malacca.</hi>
               </p>

<q>Here is a peculiar fiſh (properly a ſea-calf) of an amphibious nature; the females have breaſts, and give ſuck, and the fleſh, when well boil'd, taſtes not unlike our ſturgeon, and might eaſily be miſtaken for veal.</q>

He was a moſt barbarous tyrant, and took a diabolical delight in putting his ſubjects to the moſt cruel and lingering deaths. Elephants were often the executioners of his vengeance, and were directed to pull the unhappy criminals limb from limb with their trunks, and ſcatter them to the birds of the air, or beaſts of the field. The emperor's reſidence was at <hi>Candy,</hi> nearly in the center of the iſland; but he was, in <hi>Knox</hi>'s time, by the rebellion of his ſubjects, obliged to deſert that city.

<note place="margin">ROBERT KNOX.</note> The author <hi>Robert Knox</hi> is a writer fully to be depended on; a plain honeſt man, who, in 1657, ſailed in one of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's ſhips to <hi>Madras;</hi> and on the return, in 1659, was forced by a ſtorm into <hi>Ceylon,</hi> to refit: when his father (who was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) went on ſhore, and, with ſixteen more of the crew, were ſeized by the emperor's ſoldiers, and detained. The Captain died in a year's time. Our author lived nineteen years in the iſland, and ſaw the greateſt part of it. At length, with difficulty, he eſcaped, and arrived ſafe in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1680. His hiſtory of the iſland, and of his adventures, were publiſhed in 1680; and appears to be the only authentic account of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts, and the only one that can be entirely relied on.</p>
               <p>THERE is in this iſland a race of wild men, called <hi>Wedas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">WEDAS, OR BEDAS.</note> or <hi>Bedas;</hi> they ſpeak the <hi>Cingaleſe</hi> language, but inhabit the depth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0792500101:214"/>of woods, and the faſtneſſes of the mountains, and are, in all reſpects, as ſavage as the domeſticated animals are in the ſtate of nature.

               <p>THESE <hi>Wedas</hi> wear their hair long, collect it together, and tie it on the crown of the head in a bunch. Their complexions are, comparative to the other <hi>Cingaleſe,</hi> light: they inhabit the depth of woods, and their ſkins, that way, eſcape the effect of the burning ſun. They live entirely on fleſh, or on roots; the firſt they either eat raw, or dried, or preſerved in honey. They live either in caves, or under a tree, with the boughs cut and laid round about them to give notice when any wild beaſts come near, which they may hear by their ruſtling and trampling upon them
<note n="†" place="bottom">Knox, p. 62.</note>. They are like them, without law, and, as <hi>Wolf,</hi> page 259, ſays, without religion. <hi>Knox,</hi> p. p. 61, 62, aſſerts the contrary. The wilder ſort never ſhew themſelves; the tamer will enter into ſome kind of commerce with their civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed countrymen. Their dreſs is only a cloth wrapped round their waiſts, and brought between their legs. A ſmall ax is uſually ſtuck in the wrapper. They are ſkilful archers, and very nice in their arrows. The heads are of iron, made by the ſmiths of the civilized people. They have no other means of beſpeaking them, than leaving near the ſhop a pattern, cut out of a leaf, with a piece of fleſh by way of reward: If he does the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0792500101:215"/>work, they bring him more meat, otherwiſe they ſhoot him in the night.</p>
               <p>AFTER this account of the loweſt of the human race,
<note place="margin">ELEPHANT.</note> I fear I ſhall injure the half reaſoning elephant, on putting him on a level with ſuch of our own ſpecies as have ſcarcely any of the reaſoning particles left. This iſland was celebrated by <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. viii. c. 9, for its race of elephants, which were larger, and more adapted for war, than thoſe of <hi>India.</hi> He alſo gives the methods of capture
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. viii. c. 8.</note>. They are, at preſent, taken in different manners, and after being tamed, are ſent to the great annual fair at <hi>Jaffanapatam.</hi> The merchants of <hi>Malabar</hi> and <hi>Bengal,</hi> have notice of the numbers and qualities of the elephants to be ſet up to ſale; ſometimes a hundred are ſold at one fair. A full grown beaſt, twelve or fourteen feet high, will be ſold at the rate of two thouſand dollars.</p>
               <p>THE manner of taking theſe huge animals is thus deſcribed by Doctor <hi>Thunberg,</hi> iv. p. 240, who undertook a journey up the country to ſee what the <hi>Dutch</hi> call an <hi>Elephant-toil,</hi> or <hi>ſnare,</hi> "which ſerved for capturing and incloſing a great number of elephants. The toil was conſtructed of ſtout cocoa trees, almoſt in the form of a triangle, the ſide neareſt to the wood being very broad, and augmented with ſlighter trees and buſhes, which gradually extended themſelves into two long and impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wings. The narrower end was ſtrongly fortified with ſtakes, planted cloſe to each other, and held firmly together by ropes, and became at length ſo narrow, that only one ſingle
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0792500101:216"/>elephant could ſqueeze itſelf into the opening. When the governor gives orders for an elephant chace on the company's account, which happens at the expiration of a certain number of years, it is performed in the following manner: A great multitude of men, as well <hi>European</hi> as <hi>Cingaleſe,</hi> are ſent out into the woods, in the ſame manner in which people go out on a general hunt for wolves and bears in the north of <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe diffuſe themſelves, and encompaſs a certain extent of land which has been diſcovered to be frequented by elephants. After this they gradually draw nearer, and with great noiſe, vociferation, and beat of drum, contract the area of the circle; in the mean time the elephants approach nearer and nearer to the ſide on which the toil is placed. Finally, torches are lighted up, in order to terrify ſtill more theſe huge animals, and force them to enter into the toil prepared for them. As ſoon as they all have entered, the toil is cloſed up behind them. The laſt time that elephants were caught in this manner, their numbers amounted to upwards of a hundred, and on former occaſions has ſometimes amounted to one hundred and thirty."</p>
               <p>"THE firſt care of the captors, is to bring them out of the toil, and to tame them. For this purpoſe one or two tame elephants are placed at the ſide where the opening is, through which each elephant is let out ſingly, when he is immediately bound faſt, with ſtrong ropes, to the tame ones, who diſcipline him with their proboſcis, till he likewiſe becomes tame, and ſuffers himſelf to be handled and managed at pleaſure. This diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary correction frequently proceeds very briſkly, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accompliſhed in a few days, eſpecially as the wild elephant is at the ſame time brought under control by hunger."</p>

               <p>THIS certainly is not the <hi>Deaf Adder.</hi> The <hi>Indian</hi> jugglers, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Malabar,</hi> have a power of taming theſe dreadful animals, and inſtructing them to dance, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious and ſlow air of their flagelets. The ſerpent firſt ſeems aſtoniſhed, then begins to rear himſelf, and ſometimes by a gentle motion of the head, and with diſtended hood, ſeems to liſten with pleaſure to the notes. This is ſaid not to be peculiar to thoſe which are accuſtomed to the exerciſe, but even the ſnakes newly taken, will ſhew the ſame diſpoſition, and fling themſelves into the ſame attitudes.</p>

                  <q>HAD Providence left the feathered tribe unendowed with any particular inſtinct, the birds of the torrid zone would have built their neſts in the ſame unguarded manner as thoſe of <hi>Europe:</hi> but there, the leſſer ſpecies, having a certain preſcience of the dangers that ſurround them, and of their own weakneſs, ſuſpend their neſt at the extreme branches of the trees: they are conſcious of inhabiting a climate replete with enemies to them and their young; with ſnakes that twine up the bodies of the trees, and apes that are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſearch of prey; but, heaven-inſtructed, they clude the gliding of the one, and the activity of the other.</q>

                  <q>THE brute creation in the torrid zone, are more at enmity with one another, than in other climates; and the birds are obliged to exert unuſual artifice in placing their little broods out of the reach of an invader. Each aims at the ſame end, though by different means. Some form their penfile neſt in ſhape of a purſe, deep, and open at top; others, with a hole in the ſide; and others, ſtill more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their lodge near the ſummit.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>BUT the little ſpecies we deſcribe, ſeems to have greater diffidence than any of the others; it will not truſt its neſt even to the extremity of a ſlender twig, but makes one more advance to ſafety, by ſixing it to the leaf itſelf.</q>

Its eggs are white: the color of the bird, light yellow; its length three inches; its weight only three ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenths of an ounce; ſo that the materials of the neſt, and its own ſize, are not likely to draw down a habitation that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on ſo ſlight a tenure.</q>

Mr. <hi>Loten</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that when he was governor in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> one morning at break of day he ſaw ſome hundreds entangled on the boughs of the great <hi>Waringen</hi> tree, before his window, and ordered one of his <hi>Ceyloneſe</hi> ſervants to take them off. They are excellent food, and are often ſhot by the <hi>Europeans.</hi> They are obſerved never to alight on the ground, but to perch on high trees, and give this the preference, on account of the fruit. It is for the ſame reaſon the haunt of various other birds; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſweetneſs of the fruit, it is neglected by mankind.</p>
               <p>THIS tree immediately attracted the attention of the antients. <hi>Oneſicritus,</hi> the philoſopher who followed <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in his expedition into <hi>India,</hi> commanded his galley, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded his actions, firſt gives us an account of this wonderful tree. For this, at leſt, he does not merit the ſevere remark made on him by <hi>Strabo,</hi> lib. xv. p. 1022, who ſeems incredulous to all he ſays; poſſibly there may be other points in which he may be alſo defended. This tree riſes high in the air, then drops its boughs, which take root, and ſucceſſively create new ſtems, till a vaſt extent is covered with the arched ſhade. It is even ſaid to form of itſelf a foreſt of arched avenues, and a labyrinth of alleys, impenetrable by the rays of the vertical ſun; perhaps the extent may be exaggerated. We will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ourſelves with giving the dimenſions of one near <hi>Manjee,</hi> weſt of <hi>Patna;</hi> the diameter of which was from three hundred and ſixty three feet, to three hundred and ſeventy three: the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0792500101:231"/>circumference of the ſhadow at noon, eleven hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; that of the ſeveral ſtems, which were no more than fifty or ſixty, nine hundred and twenty-one. Hundreds of people may find a comfortable retreat beneath its foliage. Such is the account given by the veracious Mr. <hi>Marſden,</hi> in page 131 of his excellent hiſtory of <hi>Sumatra.</hi>

               <p>THIS valuable tree grows in greater quantity in the iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> than any other place. It grows wild in the woods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any culture: every province does not poſſeſs it, there is none in that of <hi>Jaffanapatam,</hi> nor <hi>Manaar,</hi> but abound in moſt of the internal parts, and about <hi>Negumbo</hi> and <hi>Gale.</hi> A pigeon, I think the Pompadour, <hi>Brown's Illuſtr.</hi> tab. 19, is the ſpecies, which, by carrying the fruit to different places, is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminator of this valuable tree. I do not believe it to be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this iſland; but the bark is infinitely ſuperior in quality to any other. Botaniſts enumerate numbers of kinds, but they only vary being taken from trees of different ages, or growing in different ſoils, and ſituations. It may be found in <hi>Malabar, Sumatra,</hi> &amp;c. but is depretiated by another name, <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and <hi>Canella,</hi> to our unſpeakable loſs;
<note place="margin">CINNAMON, OR CASSIA.</note> 
                  <hi>Cinnamomum</hi> was a more dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified name. The antients ſpeak of it under that title, in ſuch high terms, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> wiſely retained the name, which gave it greateſt reſpectability. Our countryman, the late <hi>Taylor White,</hi> Eſq. in Ph. Tranſ. vol. l. p. 860, and Mr. <hi>Combes,</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in <hi>Sumatra,</hi> in page 873, are entirely of opinion, that <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon</hi> and <hi>Caſſia</hi> do not ſpecifically differ. Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s account is accompanied with ſome very good figures of the leaves of the former.</p>
               <p>THE celebrated bark is the inner, and is reckoned the moſt perfect when taken from trees of ſeven or eight years old, if they grow in a wet ſlimy ſoil; but thoſe which grow in the warm white
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0792500101:246"/>ſand of the vallies, come to maturity in five years. <hi>Seba</hi> ſays, that the ages of the trees are fourteen, fifteen, or ſixteen years. It is the heat which gives the bark that quilled form in which it comes over to us, eſpecially the ſmaller and more delicate ſort, which is taken from the ſmaller branches. The bark is firſt freed from the external coat, when it is on the trees; is then cut lengthways, ſtripped off, dried in the ſand, and ſo becomes merchantable.</p>
               <p>THE barkers of cinnamon are brought up to the trade, and are called <hi>Chialiaſes.</hi> The account given by Mr. <hi>Eſchelſkroon</hi> of the management, is moſt authentic; from him I ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe what will be highly ſatisfactory to the readers. At page 339 of <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s account of the iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> he begins thus:—
<q>The time for barking the tree commences in the months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and ſometimes even in <hi>Auguſt:</hi> now as ſoon as they come out of their villages for that purpoſe, every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict ſends a detachment of <hi>Dutch</hi> ſoldiers, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the natives themſelves, called <hi>Laſcaryns,</hi> along with them, in order to guard the wood where they are to work, and this partly on account of the roving <hi>Cingaleſe</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers, which ſometimes fall on the barked cinnamon, and make it their booty; but ſtill more for the purpoſe of having an eye upon the <hi>Chialiaſes</hi> themſelves, that they may not be able to conceal any of the cinnamon, and afterwards carry it off.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE bark that is peeled during the day, muſt be carried every evening to the <hi>Dutch</hi> guard, belonging to their reſpective diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts; there cleanſed, well dried, and made up into bundles, and afterwards taken in cloſe caſes to the factory, where they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0792500101:247"/>are weighed, and received by the company as payment of the aſſeſſment or tax impoſed on theſe people by government. A man muſt be a very good hand indeed, that can gather thirty pounds of cinnamon in a day; whence it is eaſily calculated, how many perſons it will take to gather ten or twelve million pounds, and that too of the beſt; for what is brought in is looked over before it is weighed, and the refuſe of it burned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>At the time for gathering this drug, the company are obliged to draw out a <hi>cordon</hi> of ſeventy-two miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; and as there are a great many of theſe <hi>corps de garde,</hi> it follows that the company muſt pay a great many <hi>Europeans,</hi> as well as <hi>Cingaleſe.</hi> Theſe cinnamon barkers are under the command of a captain, called a <hi>Malabadde,</hi> and are diſtributed into four different claſſes. All the <hi>Chiliaſes</hi> muſt be ready at all times to work at the Governor's command, for on him it depends how much is to be barked and delivered in; and this again depends on the demand for it from <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>THIS important article of luxury was well known to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. The <hi>Greeks</hi> called it <gap reason="foreign">

The juice, or expreſſed oil, at one thouſand

                  <hi>denarii,</hi> or £.32. 5. 10. The <hi>Daphnoides,</hi> or <hi>Iſocinnamon,</hi> ſeems not to be thought the genuine kind, yet ſold at the price of three hundred <hi>denarii,</hi> or £.8. 13. 9, the ſame price as the true <hi>cinnamon.</hi> The <hi>Cinnamomum camocans</hi> was the expreſſed juice of a nut, and perhaps a different article from the true <hi>cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon,</hi> was ſold for no more than forty aſſes, or two ſhillings and ſeven-pence. The antients, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> eſteemed, as we do at preſent, the cinnamon of the young twigs. It was chiefly made uſe of as a perfume, either as an ingredient for their unguents, or to rub their bodies with, in form of oil. They appear to have been ignorant of the tree that produced it, as well as the country; they ſuppoſed that it came from that part of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> which bordered on the <hi>Troglodytes. Pliny</hi> ſays they bought all they could of their neighbors; but even Mr. <hi>Bruce,</hi> who would certainly do all the honor he could to <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> never mentions it among his botanical enumerations. <hi>Pliny</hi> talks confuſedly of a long voyage made with the cargoes of this pretious article, and of the croſſing of vaſt ſeas: of the cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being under the protection of the god <hi>Aſſabinus,</hi> and of its never being cut without his permiſſion. I dare ſay that the <hi>Cinnamon</hi> and <hi>Caſſia</hi> came then as it does now, from the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar</hi> coaſt, and <hi>Taprobone</hi> or <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and that the merchants croſſing the <hi>Sinus Aethiopicus</hi> in ſearch of it, induced the <hi>Roman</hi> Naturaliſt to make <hi>Aethiopia</hi> its native country
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pliny, in lib. xii. c. xix. and other parts of his Nat. Hiſt, treats largely of this tree.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE antients give a moſt romantic account of theſe trees, that of their being guarded by a dire ſpecies of bat, fighting cruelly with their ſharp claws; and by flying ſerpents; one was
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0792500101:249"/>the enormous bat of the torrid zone; the others, the winged lizard, before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>ITS modern uſe for culinary purpoſes is unknown to none. <hi>Cinnamon-water</hi> is alſo a fine <hi>liqueur.</hi> From the leaves is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a thick and fragrant juice, appropriated for the candles of his imperial Majeſty of <hi>Ceylon;</hi> and from the roots is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the oil of camphire, and a ſort of camphire ſuperior to what we have in the ſhops, which likewiſe is reſerved for the Emperor, who eſteems it an excellent cordial. <hi>Seba,</hi> in Ph. Tranſ. abr. vi. 326, from whom we have the account, ſpeaks highly of its virtue in <hi>arthritic</hi> caſes. The bark, and eſſential oil, is an article in our diſpenſary.</p>

               <p>IN <hi>Ceylon</hi> are found two ſpecies of the bread-fruit,
<note place="margin">BREAD FRUIT.</note> the <hi>Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus</hi> of botaniſts. One, the <hi>Integrifolia, Lin. Suppl.</hi> 412;
<note place="margin">THE INTEGRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FOLIA.</note> the other, the <hi>Inciſus,</hi> 411. It is ſingular, that this bleſſing to the iſland ſhould paſs ſo long unnoticed: Yet <hi>Knox,</hi> page 14, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us of (perhaps) both kinds, certainly of the firſt, and that above a century ago. The <hi>Integrifolia</hi> he calls by the <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loneſe</hi> name, <hi>Warragah,</hi> which is the ſpecies ſilled with great kernels: ſee the fruit expreſſed in different plates, entire and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, by M. <hi>Sonnerat,</hi> in his voyage to <hi>New Guinea,</hi> at page 99. Theſe kernels are taken out and boiled by the natives, and often prove preſervatives againſt famine in ſcarcity of rice. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly the rind appears prickly, but the ſpines are ſoft, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0792500101:261"/>give way to the touch. After the interval of a century, from the time of <hi>Knox,</hi> Doctor <hi>Thunberg</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Travels, iv. p. 255.</note> gives an account of both ſpecies. This he ſays is the <hi>Maldivian ſour ſack</hi> of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that it contains two or three hundred great kernels, each four times the ſize of an almond; and that the fruit grows to the weight of thirty or forty pounds; that the taſte is unpleaſant, and cadaverous, yet that not fewer than fifteen diſhes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from it. He adds, that the trees of both kind are replete with a milky juice, as tenacious as bird-lime itſelf; and <hi>Knox</hi> adds, that the boys apply it to that purpoſe. <hi>Rumphius,</hi> i. p. 104, calls the larger variety of this ſpecies <hi>Saccus Arboreus major, Nanha,</hi> and gives the figure in tab. xxx. The other he names <hi>Saccus Arboreus minor Tsjampedaka,</hi> ſee p. 107, tab. xxxi. both theſe are oblong; the laſt ſack-ſhaped. The leaves are entire and ovated. The fruit grow in a moſt ſingular manner, hanging by the ſtalk from the body of the tree, <hi>ex arbore trunco prode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> ſays <hi>Bauhin,</hi> in his Pinax, p. 511. See alſo the figure in <hi>Rumphius,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Linſchotten,</hi> tab. 76, 77.</p>
               <p>THIS ſpecies grows in moſt of the ſame places with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<note place="margin">PLACES.</note> It is alſo frequent in the <hi>Maldive</hi> iſles, from whence, in about the year 1727, or 1728, ſome roots were brought, and planted in this iſland. From this circumſtance the ſpecies is called <hi>Maldiviſche Syr Sack.</hi>

This tree is ſuppoſed to have been introduced by the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> from the <hi>Brazils</hi> into the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> many other ſpecies, now common there, are thought to have been brought by them from the new world.</p>

This is the celebrated plant which the <hi>Jews</hi> believe to have been the tree of knowlege of good and evil, placed in the midſt of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which our great mother was forbidden to touch; and by her diſobedience brought ſuch heavy penalty on all her offspring. <hi>Milton</hi> does not attempt to deſcribe it; he only ſays—

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0792500101:266"/>Moderns do not ſpeak in raptures of the fruit. Sir <hi>Joſeph Banks</hi> gives the moſt favorable account, that they all have a pleaſant vinous taſte. Three ſpecies merit that praiſe; the others muſt be dreſſed by frying or boiling, and ſo eaten as bread. But the form of the plant is the moſt groteſque in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and moſt rich when loaden, as it is, with its ſplendid look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit. The ſtem grows to the height of ten or twelve feet, and to the thickneſs of a man's leg, yet can readily be cut through with a knife; neither does it live above two years. It cannot riſe to the dignity of a tree: Its leaves are the largeſt of any known vegetable; ſome are more than twelve feet long, and two broad; are very ſmooth, of an elegant green above, and yellow beneath; they more reſemble paper than a leaf, and give a moſt ruſtling ſound. The fruit grows in vaſt cluſters, and is of an oblong ſhape, and is filled with a pulp ſoft as butter. Doctor <hi>Trew,</hi> by the ſkilful hand of <hi>Ehret,</hi> gives of it the moſt comprehenſive idea.</p>
               <p>THIS fine plant was not overlooked by the antients.
<note place="margin">PALA PLINII.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> certainly means this ſpecies by his <hi>Pala,</hi> which he deſcribes in theſe words, lib. xii. c. 6,—<q>Major alia pomo et ſuavitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentior, quo ſapientes <hi>Indorum</hi> vivunt. Folium alas avium imitatur longitudine trium cubitorum, latitudine duûm. Fructum cortice emittit, admirabilem ſucci dulcedine, ut uno quaternos ſatiet. Arbori nomen palae, pomo arienae.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS account agrees well, not only in the ſize of the leaves and fruit, and delicacy of the pulp, but it alſo gives us reaſon to ſuppoſe, that there had been ſome tradition delivered down to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0792500101:267"/>the <hi>Indians</hi> of its having been the <hi>Paradiſiacal</hi> tree, and that it continued the food of the wiſe men, or the <hi>Brahmins,</hi> as if it was ſuppoſed to ſtill have the power of imparting wiſdom to thoſe who fed on its fruits. <hi>Linnaeus</hi> gives the name of MUSA <hi>ſapientum, Trew's Ehret,</hi> tab. 21, 22, 23, to another ſpecies, with a ſhorter fruit.

                  <hi>Trincomale</hi> harbour is in Lat. 8° 30″, a fine and ſecure port, protected by a ſtrong garriſon, conſiſting of about four hundred men. Such was the number in fort <hi>Oſtenburgh,</hi> when it was taken by aſſault, on <hi>January</hi> 11, 1782, by our brave ſeaman, Sir <hi>Edward Hughes;</hi> which, on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 26 of the ſame year, was wreſted from us by his active and gallant rival <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON <hi>September</hi> 2d, the former came off <hi>Trincomale,</hi> and to his great ſurpriſe found the <hi>French</hi> colors flying on all the forts, <hi>Suffrein,</hi> with a ſuperior ſquadron, ſailed out of the harbour, ſecure, as he thought, of victory. Our brave admiral, and his officers, enraged at the loſs of the place, eagerly accepted the offer of combat. The contending admirals diſplayed every proof of courage and ſkill. <hi>Suffrein</hi>'s ſhip was reduced to a wreck, and he obliged to remove his flag to another. By ſome neglect of ours we loſt the diſabled ſhip. Night alone terminated the battle. <hi>Suffrein</hi> retired into <hi>Trincomale,</hi> crowding in without order. Thus ſecured, <hi>Hughes</hi> left him reluctantly, and ſailed for <hi>Madras</hi> with his ſhattered ſquadron. Our loſs was inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, in common men, for it did not exceed fifty-one killed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0792500101:277"/>and three hundred wounded. In officers we ſuffered ſeverely. The captains <hi>Lumley, Watt,</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> fell in the action. The loſs of the <hi>French</hi> was enormous. Four hundred and twelve men were killed, and ſix hundred and ſeventy-ſix were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The carnage on board the gallant <hi>Suffrein</hi>'s ſhip, the <hi>Hero,</hi> was unheard in any fight of any age, it was an unparalleled car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. Many of the <hi>French</hi> captains had behaved ill, ſix were broke, and ſent priſoners to the iſland of <hi>Mauritius;</hi> and thus ended the unavailing ſlaughters in the <hi>Indian</hi> ſeas.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF SIR WILLIAM JAMES, BARONET;</head>
            <byline>COMMUNICATED BY LADY JAMES.</byline>
            <p>SIR WILLIAM JAMES embarked in a ſea life at twelve years of age. He was more than twenty years at ſea before he got the command of a ſhip. He was with Sir <hi>Edward Hawke</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> in 1738, as a junior officer. Some years after, he commanded a ſhip in the <hi>Virginia</hi> trade; in her he was taken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> and carried a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the <hi>Havannah.</hi> His ſufferings after his captivity will be related hereaſter:—In the beginning of 1747, he went to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> as chief officer of one of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's ſhips, and performed two voyages in that ſtation. In 1749, the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company appointed him to the command of a new ſhip called the <hi>Guardian,</hi> equipped as a ſhip of war; in her he ſailed to <hi>Bombay,</hi> to protect the trade on the <hi>Malabar</hi> coaſt, which was much annoyed by the depredations of <hi>Angria,</hi> and other pirates, with which thoſe ſeas ſwarmed.</p>
            <p>DURING two years he was conſtantly employed in convoying the merchant ſhips from <hi>Bombay</hi> and <hi>Surat,</hi> to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> the Gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and up and down the <hi>Malabar</hi> coaſt, from the Gulph of <hi>Cambay</hi> to Cape <hi>Comorin.</hi> He was frequently attacked on this ſervice by the different piratical ſtates. At one time, when he had near ſeventy ſail of ſhips and veſſels under his charge, he was aſſailed by a large fleet of <hi>Angria</hi>'s frigates and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0792500101:281"/>gallivats, full of men. With the <hi>Guardian, Bombay</hi> grab, and <hi>Drake</hi> bomb ketch, he engaged the enemy, and kept them in cloſe action, whilſt his fleet got ſafe into <hi>Tellicherry.</hi> In this conflict he ſunk one of the enemies largeſt gallivats, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the reſt to ſeek for ſafety in <hi>Gheriah</hi> and <hi>Severndroog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT the beginning of the year 1751, Sir <hi>William</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed commander in chief of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine forces, and hoiſted his broad pendant on board the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi> a ſine ſhip of 44 guns. On <hi>April</hi> 2d, 1755, he was ſent with the <hi>Protector, Guardian, Bombay</hi> grab, and <hi>Drake</hi> bomb, with ſome gallivats, to attempt ſuch of the ports belonging to <hi>Angria</hi> which lie to the northward of <hi>Gheriah,</hi> his principal fortreſs, and capital.</p>
            <p>THE chief of theſe fortreſſes was <hi>Severndroog,</hi> where <hi>Angria</hi>'s veſſels refitted, and took ſhelter when they could not reach <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah.</hi> It was well defended by batteries along the ſhore, and the entrance of the harbour was ſecured by a ſtrong caſtle, on which were mounted ſeventy pieces of cannon. <hi>Angria</hi>'s people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>Severndroog</hi> as their ſtrongeſt hold next to <hi>Gheriah.</hi> Sir <hi>William,</hi> having reconnoitred the place, and informed himſelf of its ſtrength, brought his ſhips with a leading wind cloſe to the caſtle-walls, and by a ſteady well-directed fire (whilſt the <hi>Drake</hi> threw in her bombs) ſoon brought on a parley, and in leſs than three hours the governor ſurrendered the caſtle, and the veſſels in the harbour; from hence Sir <hi>William</hi> went to <hi>Fort Victoria,</hi> which quickly followed the fate of <hi>Severndroog;</hi> and the next day four other forts were numbered in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: all theſe falling, was a ſevere blow to <hi>Angria,</hi> who
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0792500101:282"/>had a ſhort time before attacked a fleet of <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips, under the protection of a 50 gun ſhip and a frigate: The <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet was diſperſed, and the 50 gun ſhip, and ſome of the merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were brought in great triumph to <hi>Gheriah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN Sir <hi>William</hi> returned with his victorious fleet to <hi>Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay,</hi> he found Admiral <hi>Watſon</hi> there, with three line-of-battle ſhips, and ſome frigates, &amp;c. The government of <hi>Bombay</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Admiral about means to deſtroy the powers of <hi>Angria,</hi> and the <hi>Mahratta</hi> ſtates joined in the confederacy, for they had ſuffered by his depredations.</p>
            <p>SIR <hi>William</hi> was ſent with his little ſquadron to reconnoitre <hi>Gheriah,</hi> a place repreſented to be almoſt impregnable from the ſea. He judiciouſly ſtood cloſe in to the walls, under the cover of night, and with his boat ſounded and examined the channels leading to the harbour, and outer road; in the day-time he ſtood in within gun-ſhot of the walls; and having in two days made himſelf perfectly maſter of the enemy's ſtrength, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Bombay.</hi> This piece of ſervice he performed with ſo much promptneſs and ſkill, that he received the thanks of the Governor and Admiral; and they were ſo well perſuaded, from his report, of the practicability of the enterprize, that no time was loſt in equipping the ſhips, and embarking the troops.</p>
            <p>THE ſquadron formed off <hi>Gheriah</hi> the 10th <hi>February,</hi> 1756. Sir <hi>William,</hi> in the <hi>Protector,</hi> led the ſquadron to the attack in one diviſion, whilſt another diviſion of frigates led the bomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketches in another line; a heavy and tremendous ſire began on our part from the ſhips of the line, whilſt the ſhells were thrown with great ſucceſs from the bombs into the harbour, where all <hi>Angria</hi>'s ſhips were hawled for ſafety; theſe were ſoon ſet on
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0792500101:283"/>fire by the bombs; the fire from the caſtle and batteries ſoon ſlackened, and before the evening ſet in, the caſtle ſurrendered, and <hi>Gheriah,</hi> and all its dependencies, fell into our hands. Thus ſhortly ended an enterprize, which, for many years, had been in contemplation by the <hi>European</hi> governments in <hi>India,</hi> but which was never before attempted, from an idea that no force ſufficient could be brought againſt the walls of this caſtle. Lord <hi>Clive,</hi> at this time a lieutenant-colonel, commanded the land forces.</p>
            <p>ON the <hi>Malabar</hi> coaſt, ſoon after this, he fell in with a <hi>French</hi> ſhip from <hi>Mauritius,</hi> very much his ſuperior in men and guns; ſhe was called <hi>l'Indienne:</hi> after a ſmart action ſhe ſtruck, and Sir <hi>William</hi> carried her in triumph to <hi>Bombay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIR <hi>William James,</hi> in an eminent manner, diſplayed his nautical abilities, by ſhewing, that in deſpight of a contrary monſoon, a communication between <hi>Bombay</hi> and the <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel</hi> coaſt may be effected in caſes of exigency
<note n="*" place="bottom">The tracks are laid down in Mr. Arrowſinith's map of the world.</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS paſſage was attempted by Sir <hi>William</hi> in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and he accompliſhed it in nearly as ſhort a time as it uſually was done in the favorable monſoon. It was of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt moment that he ſucceeded at the time he did, for by it, he conſirmed to Admiral <hi>Watſon</hi> (then in the <hi>Ganges)</hi> the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the war with <hi>France,</hi> and brought to his aſſiſtance 500 troops, by which the Admiral and Colonel <hi>Clive</hi> were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in <hi>March</hi> 1757, to take <hi>Chandenagore,</hi> the chief of the <hi>French</hi> ſettlements in <hi>Bengal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN effecting this paſſage, the commodore croſſed the equator
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0792500101:284"/>in the meridian of <hi>Bombay,</hi> and continued his courſe to the ſouthward as far as the tenth degree, and then was enabled to go as far to the eaſtward as the meridian of <hi>Atcheen</hi> head, the N. W. extremity of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> from whence, with the N. E. monſoon, which then prevaled in the bay of <hi>Bengal,</hi> he could with eaſe gain the entrance of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> or any port on the <hi>Coromandel</hi> coaſt.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of this narrative it was mentioned, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had ſuffered ſhipwreck. The uncommon hardſhips he and his people encountered were as follows:—After they were releaſed from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> priſon at the <hi>Havannah,</hi> they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a ſmall brig for <hi>Carolina.</hi> The crew of the brig, and Sir <hi>William</hi> and his people, amounted to fifteen. The ſecond day after putting to ſea, a very hard gale of wind came on; the veſſel ſtrained, and ſoon became ſo leaky, that the pumps and the people bailing could not keep her free; and at length, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worn out with labor, ſeven of them, with Sir <hi>William,</hi> got into the only boat they had, with a ſmall bag of biſcuit and a keg of water; the veſſel ſoon after diſappeared, and went down. They were twenty days in this boat without a compaſs; their biſcuit ſoon got wet with the ſea, which for two days made a breach over the boat; a ſnuff-box Sir <hi>William</hi> had with him ſerved to diſtribute their daily allowance of water; and after encountering every difficulty of famine and ſevere labor, on the twentieth day they found themſelves on the iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> not ten miles from whence they had been embarked out of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> priſon: but a priſon had no horrors to them. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> received them once more into captivity; and it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0792500101:285"/>that only one out of the ſeven periſhed, though after they got on ſhore, but few of them had the uſe of their limbs for many days.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1759, Sir <hi>William</hi> returned to his native country. The <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company preſented him with a handſome ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant gold-hilted ſword, with a complimentary motto, expreſſive of their ſenſe of his gallant ſervices. Soon afterwards he was choſen a director, and continued a member of that reſpectable body more than twenty years; in which time he had filled both the chairs. He was fifteen years deputy maſter of the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Trinity Houſe;</hi> a governor of <hi>Greenwich</hi> hoſpital; ſerved two ſeſſions in parliament for <hi>Weſt Looe;</hi> and on the 25th of <hi>July</hi> 1778, the King was pleaſed to create him a baronet.</p>
            <p>He planned the reduction of <hi>Pondicherry</hi> during the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> war, and received a rich ſervice of plate from the <hi>India</hi> Company, as a teſtimony of their ſenſe of his ſkill and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that affair.</p>
            <p>ON the 16th <hi>December,</hi> 1783, Sir <hi>William</hi> died, aged 62. In the year following, a handſome building was erected on his eſtate in <hi>Kent,</hi> near the top of <hi>Shooter's Hill;</hi> it is built in the ſtyle of a caſtle, with three ſides, and commands a moſt extenſive view. The loweſt room is adorned with weapons peculiar to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries of the Eaſt. The room above has different views of naval actions and enterprizes painted on the ceiling, in which Sir <hi>William</hi> had been a conſiderable actor. The top of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is finiſhed with battlements about ſixty feet from the baſe. The top of the battlements are four hundred and eighty feet above the level of <hi>Shooter's Hill,</hi> and more than a hundred and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0792500101:286"/>forty feet higher than the top of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s cupola.—On a tablet over the entrance door is this inſcription:
<q>
                  <l>This Building was erected M.DCC.LXXXIV.</l>
