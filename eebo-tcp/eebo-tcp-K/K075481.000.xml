            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AMONG all the uſeful and inſtructive Books written for the multitude, there has been none calculated to give that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary information to Strangers coming to reſide in London, which they are always in want of, nor any pointing out thoſe eaſy and ſalutary remedies which the inhabitants of the metropolis may have recourſe to, to protect them from the arts and villainies of thoſe who prey upon the ignorant and incautious. Impreſſed with the idea of the utility of ſuch a work, the author of the ſubſequent pages has given them to the world, and flatters himſelf he has omitted nothing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known, to ſecure the individual in tranquillity and the peaceable enjoyment of his home, and put him in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of conducting his domeſtic concerns with wiſdom and oeconomy.</p>
            <p>If the reader is deſirous of hauing a Compendium of all the laws that reſpect, him as a domeſtic man, a gentleman, and a member of ſociety, and lead him to avoid the penalties he is liable to, I will refer him to a work lately publiſhed, called <hi>THE COUNTRY LAWYER,</hi> where he will find every ſubject in which he has any intereſt fully treated of, and on the beſt authorities: the particulars of this work he will find in an advertiſement at the end.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>HOUSES.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HOUSES and lodgings in London are let either furniſhed or unfurniſhed, and their prices are according to their ſize, their ſituation, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fitting up. In the central parts of London and Weſtminſter, ſuch as the neighbourhood of St. James's, Charing-Croſs, the ſquares, Covent-Garden, the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, St. Paul's Church-yard, Cheapſide, the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, &amp;c. they are high rented; in more diſtant parts they are cheaper, and in by-ſtreets, courts, lanes, alleys, and ſuch obſcure places, cheaper ſtill.</p>
               <p>A private houſe 24 feet in front, and about ſeventy deep, two or three rooms on a floor, unfurniſhed, in the beſt ſtreets, will let from 100 guineas a-year to 150; ſuch a houſe, in other places, may be had from 80 to 100 guineas: unfurniſhed lodgings in ſuch houſes are ſeldom to be met with.</p>
               <p>In leſs central places, but in good ſtreets, unfurniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſes of twenty feet in front, two rooms and a light cloſet on a floor, may be had for ſixty or ſeventy guineas a-year; and houſes of eighteen feet in front for forty or thirty guineas, according to the ſituation and conveniencies. Unfurniſhed lodgings in ſuch houſes let proportionably. The firſt floor generally goes at half the net rent of the houſe without taxes; the parlour floor, or ſecond floor, at one fourth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0744100700:22"/>2. Houſes about twenty-one feet in front will let from four guineas a week furniſhed to eight guineas, according to the ſeaſon of the year and the time they are engaged for. The deareſt ſeaſon is from Chriſtmas to June, when families are in town and the parliament ſitting; the cheapeſt, when families are out of town, and the parliament prorogued. In the winter ſeaſon, ſuch a houſe as I have mentioned, taken for four or five months, may poſſibly be had for ſeven guineas a-week. Thus taken, the tenant pays no taxes, the goods are delivered on inventory, and whatever is deſtroyed is paid for. Furniſhed lodgings, that is, the firſt floor with a ſervant's room, &amp;c. in ſuch a houſe, will let for from two guineas a-week to three and a half, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the goodneſs of the furniture, the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies wanted, the trouble given, the time they are engaged for, and the ſeaſon of the year.</p>
               <p>Houſes of fifty guineas a-year rent will let furniſhed for from two guineas weekly to five, and the firſt floor furniſhed will let for, from one guinea a week to two guineas; ſecond floors two thirds of the rent of firſt floors, and parlour floors at the price of ſecond floors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is generally eſtimated, that in lodging-houſes the rent of the firſt floor furniſhed, with other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, ſuch as kitchen, cellars, garret, &amp;c. ſhall pay the rent and taxes of the whole houſe unfurniſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Shops, when let ſeparate, will fetch from 20 l. a-year to 60 l. free of taxes, according to their ſize, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, trade of the ſtreet, and ſhew of window.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Landlords have now got into a method of making tenants pay guineas for rent inſtead of pounds, and alſo land-tax and repairs; but all theſe outgoings ſhould be conſidered when the agreement is made, as well as the taxes on the houſe, for in ſome pariſhes the poor-rates and land-tax are lower than in others. Perſons who have money may often get the remnant of a leaſe cheap, provided they will pay down a certain ſum of money for ſuch leaſe; for there are always diſtreſſed houſe-keepers in London, trying to procure money by every poſſible means; for which reaſon, ſuch as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a leaſe ſhould examine the covenants of that leaſe, and the ſtate of the building, and particularly take care
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0744100700:23"/>
that the rent and taxes are paid up to the time they take poſſeſſion of it, and alſo the ground-rent, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the receipts; otherwiſe the tenant may have the arrears of ſuch rent or taxes to pay, and the ſeller of the leaſe may not be found, or, if found, not able to repay.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The general conditions of a leaſe are, to leave ſuch fixtures at the end of the term as are given in with the leaſe on ſchedule, and to leave it in ſuch a ſtate as it was in when taken, the wear from time only excepted; to pay the rent half-yearly, under a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the leaſe, but with a liberty of aſſigning it dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the term.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If a tenant purchaſes or takes a leaſe of another tenant, during its term, by aſſignment, he is no longer bound for the rent than whilſt it is in his poſſeſſion; he may aſſign it to another, and, this done, is no longer anſwerable for the rent; but the firſt tenant, aſſigning it without the conſent of his landlord, is held bound for the rent during the whole term, if the occupier does not pay it.</p>

In purchaſing a leaſe of a tenant, it is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the purchaſer ſhould alſo buy the fixtures at a fair appraiſement; in doing this, he ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the leaſe, and ſee that he does not give money for thoſe fixtures which belong to the houſe; for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords will often fit up a houſe with every neceſſary fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and put the tenant to no expence in this matter. But if the fixtures have been put up by the tenant, he has a liberty to remove or ſell all ſuch as are not fixed to the freehold.</p>
               <p>Fixtures removeable are locks, bells, ciſterns, grates fixed, coppers, dreſſers, ſhelves, counters, &amp;c. Paper paſted to the wall, buildings erected, new windows, chimney-pieces, &amp;c. or things to beautify the houſe, &amp;c. and fixed to the freehold, muſt go with the houſe, at the end of the term, and cannot be removed.</p>
               <p>When goods or fixtures are appraiſed, the ſeller and the buyer each appoints one appraiſer, and the price is fixed between them; if they cannot agree, a third is called in by the other two, and his deciſion is final.— If ſix or eight hours is taken up in this buſineſs, each appraiſer expects a guinea for his trouble; if a few fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only are to be appraiſed, the appraiſer will expect only half-a-guinea. However, if you employ him in removing your furniture, repairing it, &amp;c. and you make a prior agreement with him, he will probably not charge you for the appraiſing of a few fixtures. Be careful to have an honeſt man for an appraiſer, for his voice has been known to have been bought over on the other ſide. When goods are appraiſed to a buyer, a greater value is put upon them than they would fetch at a ſale; and if immediately ſold, they would not fetch the appraiſed price by thirty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In taking a houſe of its owner, take care that it is in thorough repair, and give a rent accordingly.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is very dangerous to take unfurniſhed lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in London; for ſhould the tenant of the houſe not pay his rent, your goods will be liable to be ſeized for it; ſo will your carriage and horſes ſtanding at livery, for the rent of the ſtables, if that rent is in arrear.— To avoid this, enquire into the circumſtances of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0744100700:26"/>
houſe-keeper, and if you cannot get the landlord of the houſe to give you an agreement in writing, that he will not ſeize your goods for any arrears that may become due by his tenant, aſk to ſee the landlord's receipt for the laſt half-year, before you pay your own rent.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Such houſe-keepers who have troubleſome lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may remove them, if they will not quit otherwiſe, by raiſing the rent weekly upon them; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay, ſuing them for the ſame; if the lodgings are furniſhed, and they do not pay, an opportunity may be taken, when the lodger and all perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him are out of the apartments, to lock the door, and keep him from re-entering; if any thing is owing, any effects of the lodger may be detained.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If a tenant of an unfurniſhed houſe gives notice to his landlord to quit, and does not quit at the time given in ſuch notice; or if he will not quit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on a legal notice from his landlord, but holds poſſeſſion beyond his term, if the landlord has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him in writing that he expects double rent for his ſo doing, he is obliged to pay double the rent firſt agreed on. 11 Geo. 2. c. 19. ſ. 18. 4 Geo. 2. c. 28. ſ. 1.</p>
               <p>If a tenant cannot be removed by any of theſe means, he muſt be ejected out by a courſe of law.</p>
               <p>Notice of warning muſt be in writing, directed to the tenant.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It is a late determination of the courts, that if it be neceſſary to give a tenant at will half-a-year's notice to quit, the ſaid notice muſt be given half-a-year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expiration of his year; that is to ſay, his year and the notice muſt expire at the ſame time; for if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Aſſurances on buildings and goods are deemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and ſeparate adventures, ſo that the premium on goods is not advanced by reaſon of any aſſurance on the building wherein the goods are kept, nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium on the building by reaſon of any aſſurance on the goods.</p>

               <p n="9">9 As an addition to the expence of inſurance, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has laid a tax of 1 s. 6 d. on every 100 l. inſured, which muſt be paid at the time you pay your inſurance, which is always a year in advance.</p>

If inſuring as above, you have loſt 100 l. of cloaths, they will pay no more than 50 l. the ſum inſured, and the ſame in other articles.

                  <head>Cautions againſt Fire.</head>
                  <p n="13">13. To guard againſt fire, every maſter or miſtreſs of a family ſhould be particularly attentive, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants put every fire out before they go to bed, and that they put out the candles in their own room; for if a fire does not begin in your own houſe, as watchmen are always about to give notice, there is ſufficient time to eſcape. But if families ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to be ſurpriſed by fire, and cannot eſcape at the door, they ſhould by all means endeavour to be cool, and not be too much alarmed—fear overcomes reaſon, and will prevent ſtudying our ſafety. If there be no way out at the top of the houſe; from the firſt floor win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, or even from the ſecond, a perſon might eſcape by tying the blankets and ſheets together, faſtening one end to a chair, with the window half down, and throwing the other end out, and lowering himſelf down by the blankets, &amp;c. the window will prevent the chair following you.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The law enjoins, that the pariſh-officers ſhall pay as a reward to the turn-cock, whoſe water firſt reaches the place where any fire breaks out, a ſum not exceeding ten ſhillings; to the firſt engine brought complete, a ſum not exceeding thirty ſhillings; to the ſecond a ſum not exceeding twenty ſhillings; and to the third a ſum not exceeding ten ſhillings: and to make perſons careful of fire, whenever a chimney takes fire, and the houſe is not burnt, or wherever any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is done to a houſe by fire beginning in a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the pariſh-officers pay the rewards as above, the tenant or lodger, whoſe chimney is thus ſet on fire, ſhall re-pay the church-wardens the ſaid ſums, or ſuch part of them as a juſtice ſhall direct, if the matter is referred to him. 14 Geo. 3. c. 78.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But as a preſervative againſt fires, every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is furniſhed with long ladders: theſe are kept at certain places, and every family ſhould know where they are kept, and write it down, and fix the writing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0744100700:40"/>16. If families have any thing to preſerve more than ordinary; for example, ſhop-books, books of account, writings, bank-notes, caſh, &amp;c. as theſe things take but little room, it would be adviſeable for thoſe who have no other ſecure place, to put them every night into a bag, and place them in their chamber by their cloaths; they can thus be readily carried off.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Some families have ſtone-cloſets, others have iron cheſts, but the above method would be almoſt equally as ſecure.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Tradeſmen would do well to keep duplicates of their books, and lodge one ſet in the houſe of a friend; the occurrences of a week might be tranſcribed at the week's end.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Thoſe who have bank-notes ſhould always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the number, date and ſum of each note, in a book, as ſoon as received, in which caſe, if deſtroyed, on giving the bank ſecurity to re-pay the money, in caſe the note ever appears againſt them, they will give the loſer the caſh. If they receive them of bankers, and can remember where they received them, and on whoſe account, ſuch bankers will furniſh them with the particulars, as they always enter them in their books.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. If a neighbouring houſe is on fire, preſerve your temper, be cool and wary; don't be in haſte to open your doors and let in the rabble, be they as impatient as they may; for in fires, thieves are always ready to plunder a houſe, and you may loſe more that way than any other. The inſurance-offices always retain in their ſervice a number of men to attend at fires; theſe may be known by their dreſs and badge; and if you admit any into your houſe to aſſiſt you in removing your property, let theſe be the only people. The maſter of the houſe ſhould ſtand at the door himſelf for that purpoſe, and the goods, as removed, ſhould be carried to the houſe of ſome friend in the neighbourhood, on the oppoſite ſide of the ſtreet.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The taxes of a houſe in London are nearly half the rent, and are as follow:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Land-tax, a tax on the ground, paid by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, half-yearly, but generally allowed by the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord in the rent, if no agreement to the contrary.—
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0744100700:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This is generally four ſhillings in the pound, but in ſome pariſhes leſs than others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A houſe-tax paid to Government, by the tenant, of ſix-pence, nine-pence, or one ſhilling in the pound according to the rent. The rent, in this tax, is rated to the full. See <hi>Houſes,</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the houſe has a retail-ſhop belonging to it, it pays an additional tax of from four ſhillings to two ſhillings in the pound, according to the rent of the houſe. This to be paid alſo by the tenant. See <hi>Houſes,</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The poor's-rate is another tax, but a parochial one, paid by the tenant to the overſeers of the pariſh, for the maintenance of the poor. This is collected every half-year, and the aſſeſſment is from one to ſix ſhillings in the pound, or more, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poor in the pariſh. This aſſeſſment is made by the pariſh officers, and ratified by a bench of juſtices. The book, with this ratification, and the ſums each houſe-keeper is to pay, is brought round to every houſe, when the money is collected, and each inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant may ſee how much others pay, then or at any other time, on paying ſix-pence or a ſhilling. The rent of each houſe is generally eſtimated in the pariſh-book at two-thirds of the real rent paid; and if any perſon finds that he pays more in proportion than the reſt of the pariſh, he may obtain redreſs, by an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the quarter-ſeſſions, at a very little expence.</p>
                  <p>Any perſon occupying any houſe, &amp;c. out of which any other perſon aſſeſſed has removed, or which, at the making the rate was empty, every perſon ſo removing, and the perſon ſo coming into and occupying the ſame, ſhall pay to ſuch rate in proportion to the time he oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the ſame. In caſe of diſpute, the proportion to be aſcertained by two juſtices. 17 Geo. 2. c. 38. ſ. 12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another tax is the window-tax, paid by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Government, and collected half-yearly.</p>

This is only collected occaſionally, and may be from three-pence in the pound to two or three ſhillings, according to the exigencies required.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Another rate or aſſeſſment is the paving-tax, for repairing, cleaning, and lighting the ſtreets. This is one ſhilling and ſix-pence in the pound, of two-thirds of the rent or value.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Another is for watching them, but this is a trifle.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There is a further call on every houſeholder for Eaſter-offerings, for the rector or vicar of the pariſh; this is four-pence a-head for every one in each family capable of receiving the ſacrament, paid once a year, at Eaſter. But this ſeldom is collected; it is generally leſt to each family to give what they pleaſe; but it is always expected that they give ſomething; perhaps a few ſhillings.</p>
                  <p>Once or twice a year the church-wardens generally bring round a book, to make a collection for the lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or afternoon preacher. At this time a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper generally gives a few ſhillings, but this is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. A further expence to the inhabitants is the river water, with which each houſe is ſerved, from about twenty-four to thirty ſhillings a year, according to the time of ſerving, whether every day or three times a week.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The London-bridge water-works ſupply the city, and the greateſt part of its liberties, with Thames wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the rate of from twenty-four to thirty ſhillings (paid half-yearly) according to the diſtance from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-bridge. The pipes of this Company ſpread all over the city to Tower-hill, Snow-hill, Shore-ditch, and St. Dunſtan's-church, Fleet-ſtreet. Office at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-bridge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The York-building water-works, (office in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers-ſtreet, attendance from three in the afternoon till ſeven) ſupplies Weſtminſter, and the weſt end of the town, as far as Holborn, with Thames water, and will convey the water, if deſired, to the upper-ſtories of a houſe, the ſecond or third ſtory, according to their ſituation. The higher the houſe ſtands from the water ſide, the leſs height can they convey the water. The prices of the water is the ſame with the London-bridge water-works; only, if the water is to be conveyed to the ſecond or third ſtory, more money is paid annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, from thirty ſhillings to five pounds. The Thames water is reckoned ſofter than that of the new river.— If a fire happens in the night, application for water from this Company, and that of London-bridge, muſt be made at the reſpective offices, and it will be ſome time, half an hour or more, before they can get their engines to work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The New-River Company (office in Dorſet-ſtreet, Fleet-ſtreet) ſupplies all London on the north ſide of the Thames, from Mile-end turnpike to Hyde-park corner, with water brought twenty miles from London, to a reſervoir at Iſlington. The terms of this Company are rather higher than thoſe of other water-companies, but the water is generally clearer and better. They ſerve families from twenty-four ſhillings a year to five
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0744100700:45"/>
pounds, according to the quantity of water they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which is ſettled by the collector of the diſtrict, whoſe name may be known, by applying at the office, in Dorſet-ſtreet. This collector alſo will furniſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with the names of the turn-cocks in his diſtrict, printed on paper, to whom application is to be made in caſes of fire; and in the collector's receipts will be found the place to apply to, in want of water and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaints. This Company conveys the water to upper ſtories of houſes, without any additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence than the lead pipes, which are the property of, and muſt be fixed by, the tenant; the nearer a houſe ſtands to the Thames ſide, that is, the lower it is from the reſervoirs, the higher in the houſes the water can be conveyed. In the New River Water-works, the water runs from an eminence; in the London-bridge and York Company, it is forced up by fire; of courſe, the higher it is conveyed, the more money annually is required.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are other water-works, thoſe of Chelſea, Hampſtead, Bayſwater, Shadwell, Lambeth, &amp;c. that ſupply other parts of the town, and the Borough of Southwark, with ſoft water, and on nearly the ſame terms. Thrale's water-works, that ſupply part of Southwark, ſerve ſo low as 20 s. a-year.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The lead pipes from the main, that is, from the middle of the ſtreet, are conſidered as belonging to the houſe, and muſt be paid for, and kept in repair by the tenant; other repairs and expences are paid by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral companies.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Attendance is always given at the reſpective offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from morning till night, and complaints immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redreſſed. It is proper to ſend to theſe offices im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on a fire breaking out, eſpecially thoſe that ſupply the Thames water.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is adviſeable for every houſe-keeper, on firſt coming to London, to apply to the offices for the names of the turn-cocks, and where they live; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to fire-offices, for the places where the fire-engines are; alſo to the veſtry-clerks of the different pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for the places where the ladders are kept, and from year to year, who are the conſtables and other

pariſh-officers, and to write theſe down and ſtick them up in the kitchen, or other part of the houſe, that the earlieſt application, in caſe of fire, may be made for every neceſſary aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In froſty weather, to ſecure water to the houſe is the care and buſineſs of the tenant. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, freſh horſe-dung ſhould be laid over the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which the lead pipes paſs, and ſome ſhould be wound round the pipe as it croſſes the area. Dung can be had at any of the ſtables for a trifle, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of fetching it in a cart is not much.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Bakers' men, who carry the bread round to their cuſtomers, will ſometimes, if families run up a bill, ſell a loaf or two by the way, and put the money into their own pockets, telling their maſters, that they left them at ſuch houſes. The maſter, of courſe, charges the cuſtomer for bread he never had; and, when the bill comes to be paid, it perhaps occaſions a diſpute, and the buyer finds himſelf obliged to pay for it after all. To avoid this, the beſt method is, never to run a bill with a baker, but pay for the bread as it is left; or, if this be inconvenient, order the bill in every Monday morning, while the occurrences of the week are in the memory: theſe bills, examined and filed, will prevent your being cheated. Bakers, like milk-women, will ſometimes leave tallies, on which they daily chalk what is left, but a mark is eaſily added, while the ſervant is inattentive, which robs you of the price of a loaf, or a pint of milk. Theſe marks are ſometimes made on the door-poſt, oftener without the door than within; of courſe an addition can be made unknown to your ſervant, as the baker or milk-woman paſſes the door; or they may be wholly rubbed out, by wanton boys or others, as is frequently the caſe; and when the ſcore is gone, the baker or milk-woman may charge what they pleaſe; and as they can ſell a loaf or a pint of milk to thoſe who pay ready money, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete that money; to conceal this fraud from their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they will ſcore it up to their cuſtomers on credit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. With reſpect to milk, though ſold at 3 d. a quart, it is always mixed with water. There are cows that are driven into the ſtreets, about the weſt end of the town, from which you may have your milk, and ſee it milked, at 4 d. a quart, but the milk of theſe is not very good, as the cows are driven about all the day; yet it is better than what is brought by milk-women.</p>

               <head>BUTCHERS AND MEAT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is by no means adviſeable to deal with one butcher, unleſs you can agree to have all your meat, viz. beef, mutton, veal, lamb and pork, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, at one and the ſame price, all the year round; which ſome butchers will do at 5 d. a pound, and occaſionally give you, at the ſame price, a quarter of houſe-lamb. If you enter into ſuch an agreement, take care to have a bill of the weight always ſent home with the meat, and order it to be weighed by your own people.</p>
               <p>If you make no ſuch agreement, and deal regularly with one butcher, you will frequently be charged for a joint you never had; and for half a pound, or a quarter of a pound more than the joint weighs: and you will always pay a halfpenny, or a farthing more per pound, than was you to go to market and cheapen it yourſelf. In buying a joint at market, of ſeven pounds and an half, you may often deduct the half pound, but when ſent home by a butcher who credits you, never. This conduct in a family will occaſion a great ſaving at the year's end. If you pay your butcher but once a quarter, be ſure to have a bill of the weight and price ſent in with your meat, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bill of the week's meat every Monday morning. In this caſe you will ſee what you are about, and not be liable to be impoſed upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Good meat ſhould not look lean, dry, or ſhrivel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the fleſhy part ſhould be of a bright red, and the fat of a clear white. When the fleſh looks pale, and the fat yellow, the meat is not good. Cow beef is worth a penny a pound leſs than ox beef, except it be the meat of a maiden heiſer. In a buttock you may know it by the udder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The average price of beef is from 4d. a pound to 5d. The prime boiling parts are the rump, buttock edge-bone, briſkit, thick and thin flank; roaſting pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſurloin and ribs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0744100700:49"/>Butchers make a difference in price between pieces of beef to roaſt and boil; if you take a piece of each, they will ſell prime beef for 4d. halfpenny; if a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling piece alone 4d. if roaſting alone 5d.</p>
               <p>If you want rump-ſteaks in any quantity, it is cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give 7d. a pound without bone than 4d. halfpenny for the whole rump. A buttock is the cheapeſt joint, as it is free from bone; for if you wiſh it, the butcher will ſell it you without the marrow-bone, which is worth its weight for the marrow.</p>

Ewe mutton is not worth ſo much as weather by a penny in the pound; mutton five years old, if it can be got, is the moſt delicious; its natural gravy is brown. A leg of ewe mutton may be known by the udder on its ſkirt. The average price of prime weather mutton is 4d. halfpenny per pound, though it will ſell often for 5d. halfpenny.</p>

If fiſh is firm, not flabby or ſlimy, the gills ruddy or bleeding, and the eyes bright, you may depend on it it is freſh; but if otherwiſe, not ſo.

               <p>Thames ſalmon is always double the price of other ſalmon; not that it is better taſted, but being later out of the water, it can be crimped, which gives it a firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The price of ſea-ſalmon is from 9 d. to 3 s. a pound.</p>

The beſt freſh lump butter, in ſummer, may be bought for 9 d. halfpenny or 10 d. a pound; in winter for 11 d. or 12 d. Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping butter, which is the fineſt in flavour, may be there bought for 2 d. a pound more than lump butter. Butter-ſhops ſell this for 1 s. 6 d. a pound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In winter time, Cambridge and Dorſetſhire ſalt but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arrives freſh in London twice a week, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one penny or a halfpenny a pound as dear as freſh; but the beſt way for a family is to buy a half firkin, which weighs 28 lb. of the beſt Yorkſhire butter — This may be bought for 17 s. or 18 s. the half firkin, leſs than 8 d. a pound, and may be bought agreeable to the palate of the buyer; but when you taſte it, taſte a piece on the outſide, next the tub; if this is good, and free from any rankneſs, you may be certain the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0744100700:54"/>
middle is. But the middle ſhall often be ſweet, when the outſides are rank; and butter-men, knowing this, always give a taſte out of the middle. The Dorſetſhire butter, in tubs with broad hoops, weight about 80 lb. rather fetches the beſt price, but for keeping it is the beſt butter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bad butter is not to be mixed with good, on pain of forfeiting double the value. Buyers of butter ſhould ſet their mark on the tub, &amp;c. and if the ſellers open the tubs, or put in other butter, after the tubs are thus marked, they are liable to a penalty of 10 s. for every hundred weight. Application to a magiſtrate. 13 &amp; 14 Car. 2. c. 16. 4 and 5 W. &amp; M. c. 7.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Cheeſe is always the better for keeping two or three years, provided it be kept dry. Families who like good old cheeſe ſhould buy it one year under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they do their wine, &amp;c. Old cheeſe good for any thing can ſeldom be met with; and if it is, cheeſe-mongers aſk a large price for it. Cheeſe, a year and a half old, of the beſt dairies, (and the beſt is always the moſt delicious, and in the end the cheapeſt) can be bought from 4 d. halfpenny a pound to 6 d. In buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, every houſe-keeper ſhould pleaſe his own palate. Though decayed cheeſe will pleaſe many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates beſt, it may be bought a halfpenny, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a penny a pound under the price of ſound cheeſe. Gloceſter cheeſe is generally a penny a pound under the price of Cheſhire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In buying of bacon, the Wiltſhire is reckoned the beſt, and may be bought at capital ſhops for 6 d. halfpenny or 7 d. a pound, by the flitch: ſmall bacon, ſuch as weighs about 40 lb. the ſlitch, is the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. In buying it, have the flitch cut through, and if the fat looks red, and the ſkin is thin, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably turn out well, and boil firm; but if you make an agreement, the ſeller will change it, if you diſlike it. Ruſty bacon looks brown when cut, particularly at the inſide edge.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE price of coals in London is from 32 s. a chaldron to 50 s. In long froſts, they have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſo high as 5 l. but, on an average, they may be bought in ſummer time at 33 s. or 34 s. a chaldron.— Houſe-keepers ſhould endeavour to lay them in at the cheapeſt time: there are advertiſing coal-merchants, who, for ready money, will ſell 39 buſhels for two or three ſhillings under the price that others ſell 38 buſhels for; but in dealing with theſe, and indeed with other ſellers, it is prudent to ſee the coals at the wharf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſent in; and when they are ſent in, to take care you have your meaſure, otherwiſe you may have your year's coals that will not burn, or pay a larger price for them than you expected. Good coals are generally large, black and ſhining: the Pontops are the beſt. If you truſt to your coal-merchant, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the meaſurement, it will however be neceſſary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0744100700:59"/>
that the number of ſacks are counted when the coals are ſhot. Advertiſing coal-ſellers go often by fictitious names, to avoid the penalties for ſhort meaſure: it is proper, therefore, to be on your guard, particularly againſt thoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ſeveral coal-acts paſſed this year, 1786, for the cities of London and Weſtminſter, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of Southwark, coal-meters are appointed to meaſure coals when firſt carted, and re-meaſure them afterwards, if the buyer requeſts it: the coal-meters office for the city of London and its liberties, is in Earl-ſtreet, Blackfriar's-bridge; that for Weſtminſter and its liberties at the bottom of Northumberland-ſtreet, in the Strand; and thoſe for the Borough of Southwark and its diſtricts at Marigold-ſtairs, Surry-ſide of Blackfriar's-bridge, and at the Sun and Hat-Block, in the Maize, Tooley-ſtreet. Theſe offices are open all day, to hear complaints and give redreſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Coals, when taken out of the barge, and ſold as wharf-meaſure, are to be meaſured in the preſence of a coal-meter. The ſeller to pay 4 d. a chaldron for meaſuring, which the buyer is to re-pay, on a ticket of ſuch meaſurement being produced by the carman, under the penalty of 10 s. for the carter not delivering ſuch ticket. But when brought in, if the buyer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf diſſatisfied with the meaſure, the driver of the cart ſhall not depart, till a coal-meter can be procured from the above offices to re-meaſure them, on pain of his forfeiting 20 s. and the owner of the cart 5 l.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The carman ſhall be paid 2 s. 6 d. an hour for the time he waits, and the meaſurer ſhall be paid 6 d. for meaſuring each chaldron, by the buyer; but if, on re-meaſuring, they are found deficient, the ſeller ſhall pay the expences of re-meaſuring, and alſo forfeit 5 l. a buſhel for every buſhel deficient, and forfeit the chaldron of coals to the poor; the meter ſhall forfeit 5 l. a buſhel, and the coal-porter that meaſured them 2 s. 6 d. a buſhel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But to ſave the half-crown an hour paid for waiting, it is beſt to appoint a meter to attend at the time you expect the coals. If families would keep a

buſhel-meaſure, and one may be bought for 7 s. 6 d. a ſack or two of the coals might be meaſured without much trouble.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A labouring coal-meter, delivering tickets for coals which he was not preſent at the meaſuring of, ſhall forfeit 40s. and be incapacitated, and the principal ſhall forfeit 5 l. if the 40s. penalty is not paid by the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meter in one month.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A carter fraudulently delivering, or ſuffering coals to be taken from his cart, ſhall forfeit 40 s. or be whipped and impriſoned from one to three months.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To puniſh offences, application muſt be made to a magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="9">9. All contracts for coals, not being leſs than five chaldrons, ſhall be for pool-meaſure, including the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain or addition of one chaldron in twenty, though the term of pool-meaſure ſhall not be mentioned in the contract; that is, nine buſhels or three ſacks ſhall be given in with every five chaldrons, (though ſellers now, if you buy but one chaldron, will profeſs to give you 38 buſhels). 19 Geo. 2. c. 35.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Wharfingers bribing a coal-meter ſhall forfeit 50 l.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Sacks ſhall be, when empty, four feet long, and two feet wide; and none other ſhall be uſed, on pain of the wharfinger's forfeiting 5 l. and the coal-meter 40 s.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Scotch coal is always in large pieces, and is bought by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="13">13. Charcoal is ſold retail at 1 s. 4 d. a buſhel, or 3 s. a ſack, that is three buſhels; but if had from the country, by the load, which is 60 ſacks, it may be bought for 2 s. 6 d. a ſack.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Billet-wood may be bought at the wharfs for 40 s. or two guineas a load, delivered home any where on the ſtones; a load conſiſts of 300 pieces or billets.</p>
               <p>Billet-wood, (except beech-wood) ſhall be three feet four inches long, and meaſure ſeven inches in circumference, in the ſmalleſt girth, on pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting them to the poor. 9 Ann. c. 18.</p>

All faggots to be ſold, ſhall contain in compaſs, beſides the knot of the bond, 24 inches of aſſize; and every faggot-ſtick, within the bond, ſhall be three feet long, except one ſtick of one foot in length, to harden the binding. 43 Eliz. c. 14.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the choice of ſervants, a houſe-keeper cannot be too particular. London is ſo much the ſink of vice, that the lower claſs of people are very much corrupted. Thoſe brought from the country are ſoon infected with the diſſolute manners of town-ſervants, and become equally bad with them. To expect at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment from a ſervant is idle, and betrays an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the world. Servants will now and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, in order to gain the confidence of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers, and thus forward their own intereſt; but, if we ſuppoſe them in our intereſt, it is becauſe we do not thoroughly know them. Economy in a family, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do not like. The more extravagant a maſter or miſtreſs is, the better they live, and the more they can purloin; and ſhould, what they call, a generous maſter or miſtreſs fail in the world, owing to a waſte or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention to domeſtic concerns, they will cry to their fellow-ſervants, "It is a pity! he was a good-natured generous man!—Come, let us go look for another place!" This being conſidered, we are to expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them but a performance of their duty, keep them whilſt they do it, and diſcharge them when they neglect it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt thing, then, is to endeavour to get good ones, if we do not bring them out of the country with us. There are, in different parts of the town, regiſter-offices, or places where ſervants of all denominations attend at certain hours, and where a maſter may ſee them, at the expence of one ſhilling, and hire them; or, by ſending a ſhilling to the keepers of ſuch offices, and a deſcription of the ſervant wanted, they will ſend you one, day after day, till you are ſuited; but as it is the refuſe of ſervants in general that apply to theſe offices, you muſt not take the recommendation of the office-keeper, who is paid alſo by the ſervant for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the place; nor any written character; for ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hings in London are procured from friends, and often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orged; nay ſervants of bad character will often go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0744100700:68"/>
they will refer you to perſons ſeemingly of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who perhaps know little of them. It is proper therefore, that the maſter or miſtreſs ſhould apply for the character themſelves, make ſome enquiry concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon they apply to, and aſk all thoſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they think neceſſary. There are few ſervant-maids in London, or indeed in the country, but what are whores; it is perhaps an uncharitable ſuppoſition, but it is nevertheleſs true. To expect, therefore, to meet with an innocent virtuous girl, is next to impoſſible; it is ſufficient if ſhe is orderly, and conducts herſelf with decorum. If a houſe-keeper cannot get a ſervant recommended by a friend, or ſome tradeſman with whom he deals, ſuch as the baker, butcher, poulterer, green-grocer, tallow-chandler, publican, or the like, I would recommend papers deſcribing the ſervant want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and where to apply, being ſent or left at the chandler's ſhops in the neighbourhood, which ſeldom fails of ſucceſs; others will have recourſe to advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the public newſpapers, an inſertion for which, once, coſts 3 s. 6 d. If this mode is adopted, the beſt paper to advertiſe in is the <hi>Daily Advertiſer</hi> in Fleet-ſtreet, which is taken in by almoſt all the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in London. Such an advertiſement will bring you ſcores of ſervants; and here you muſt be very careful in your choice, and particular as to charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for an advertiſement will bring with the good a number of diſreputable people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The general wages of ſervants are as follow:— Steward, valet, butler, 30 l. a-year; women-cooks, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> l. lady's-maids, from 12 l. to 20 l. inferior women ſervants, from 7 l. to 9 l. foot-men 14 l. and a livery: women-ſervants to provide their own tea and ſugar.— Board-wages of an upper ſervant 10 s. 6 d. a week, with fire and candle, and 7 s. a week to an under-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They generally agree for a month's wages, or a month's warning, which is a bad method; as there are few ſervants, when warning is given, but will be very impertinent and untractable, it is far the beſt, when you mean to part with them, to get rid of them at once, be it ever ſo inconvenient: by enquiry an honeſt chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0744100700:69"/>
to ſupply the place of a woman-ſervant, may be procured for 1 s. a day. If ſuch are hired to waſh, their wages are larger: 1 s. 6 d. with tea and a dram twice a day, and ſtrong beer at dinner and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but for this they ſlave hard, will begin work at two in the morning, and continue it till nine the next evening. If ſuch a perſon is wanted, employ none of your own ſervant's recommending, but apply for their character to thoſe houſe-keepers who have employed them, and on whom you can better rely.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Women cooks, and ſervants of all work, when they hire themſelves, will endeavour to get the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-ſtuff allowed them as a perquiſite; if you would not be robbed, never comply with this; nor allow your coachman the old wheels; for as the one will, to ſerve herſelf, ſtrip your meat of its fat, melt more but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than neceſſary, and convey the ends of candles, &amp;c. into the greaſe-pot, to increaſe its weight; ſo will the other often injure the wheels, if they are likely to laſt too long.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you deliver into the cuſtody of ſervants, plate, china, linen, &amp;c. to keep; and tell them, before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they muſt be reſponſible for it; if they loſe any part of it, the law will oblige them, as far as they are able, to make it good; but not elſe: to enable them, therefore, to pay for any thing miſſing, it is adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to keep part of their wages in hand. As they are hired by the year, they ſhould always be paid one half year under another, reſerving half-a-year in hand. As to breaking of china, &amp;c. you cannot compel a ſervant to pay for it, unleſs it was ſo agreed on the hiring, or done deſignedly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To avoid diſputes reſpecting wages, it is prudent to have the agreement in writing, and a receipt for what you pay; for (ſorry am I to ſay it) this claſs of people make as little ceremony of taking a falſe oath, where there is no proof to the contrary, as of telling a lie.</p>
               <p>Diſputes with ſervants, about wages under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0 l. and other things, if they cannot amicably be ſettled, ſhould be referred to a neighbouring magiſtrate, who is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed to hear the complaint and redreſs it; the expence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0744100700:70"/>
but trifling; but the wages of coachmen, grooms, and the like, magiſtrates can take no cognizance of.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Where ſervants are hired for a year, they cannot be put away before the expiration of that term, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reaſonable cauſe to be allowed by one juſtice; nor after the end of the term, without a quarter's warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given before witneſs; if a maſter diſcharges a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant otherwiſe, he is liable to a penalty of 40 s.— 5 Eliz. c. 4.</p>
               <p>If a ſervant refuſe to ſerve his term, he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted till he give ſecurity to ſerve the time; or he may be ſent to the houſe of correction, and puniſhed there as a diſorderly perſon. 5 Eliz. c. 4. 7 Jac. c. 4.</p>
               <p>A yearly ſervant is not to be diſcharged by reaſon of ſickneſs, or any other diſability by the act of God; not may his wages for thoſe cauſes be abated. Dalt. 129. All hiring without ſtipulation of time is, ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hiring for a year, and the law ſo conſtrues it.</p>
               <p>Both maſter and ſervant may however part by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent, and then the allowance of the cauſe by a juſtice of peace is not neceſſary. A maſter's detaining wages, or not allowing ſufficient meat, drink, &amp;c. is good cauſe for a ſervant's departure; but it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a juſtice. Dalt.</p>
               <p>If a ſervant, hired for a term, quits his ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of his term, he loſes all his wages; but if the maſter puts him away, he ſhall be paid to the time he ſerved.</p>
               <p>A woman-ſervant who marries is obliged to ſerve out her time; and if both man and wife agree to ſerve, they muſt perform the agreement. Dalt. 92.</p>
               <p>If a ſervant be retained for a year, according to the ſtatute 5 Eliz. c. 4, and the maſter die within that time, the executor muſt pay the wages; but not ſo if the retainer was not for a year.</p>
               <p>A ſervant hired at a month's wages, or a month's warning, cannot quit his place, nor be diſcharged, a day before the expiration of the month, without the whole month's wages be paid, unleſs by the authority of a juſtice, for ſome reaſonable complaint. If a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, after warning given, is inſolent, or refuſes to do his duty, a magiſtrate, on complaint, will commit him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0744100700:71"/>
to priſon, for the time he has to ſerve; but the maſter will be ordered to pay him his wages whilſt there.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If a ſervant or workman aſſault his maſter or miſtreſs, or any other having charge over them, he may be bound to his good behaviour, or be committed for a year, or leſs, at the diſcretion of two magiſtrates. 5 Eliz. c. 4. ſ. 21.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If any ſervant ſhall purloin, or make away with his maſter's goods, to the value of 40 s. it is felony.— 12 Ann. c. 7.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Should a woman with child procure herſelf to be retained with a maſter for a term, who knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof, this is good cauſe to diſcharge her from her ſervice; if ſhe prove with child during her ſervice it is the ſame; but if he does not diſcharge her before a magiſtrate, when he knows of it, and keeps her on, he muſt provide for her till her delivery, and one month after, and then ſhe is to be ſent to her place of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Dalt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A ſervant ſetting fire careleſsly to a houſe, is liable to pay, on the oath of one witneſs, a hundred pounds to the ſufferer, or be committed to hard labour for 18 months. 14 Geo. 3. c. 78.</p>
               <p n="13">13. By the 25th of Geo. 3. c. 43, every perſon keeping one male-ſervant, ſhall pay annually for him

               <p>Every perſon keeping a woman ſervant, ſhall pay annually, for one, 2s. 6d. for two, 5s. each, for three or more, 10s. each. Ibid.</p>
               <p>A batchelor in all caſes pays double theſe duties. Ib.</p>

               <p>All maſters or miſtreſſes muſt accompany their liſts with a declaration, whether they mean to pay for any, and how many ſervants, in any other place or pariſh, and to ſpecify in what place or places. S. 28.</p>
               <p>As this is an annual tax, if a perſon keeps at any one time two ſervants, for example, and enters theſe two, that is, aſſerts in his written notice that he had two before the 5th of April, ſhould one of theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants quit his ſervice a month afterwards, he muſt pay for the two, till 5th April following.</p>

If you never deal with tradeſmen upon credit, ſhould your ſervants to whom you give money to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe things, put the money in their pockets, and order them to be ſet down to you, you are not obliged to pay for them; but if you ſometimes ſend money, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deal upon credit, though you ſhould ſend the money for any article, if your ſervant does not pay it, you will be obliged to pay it again; for your tradeſman cannot be ſuppoſed to know whether the money was ſent or not.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If you would avoid being robbed, never ſuffer your ſervants to take acquaintances down into the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen with them. Many inſtances have occurred where villains have made acquaintance with incautious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, purpoſely to find a method of breaking into the houſe, and learning what there is worth coming for.</p>
               <p n="16">16. To ſave trouble to the maſter and ſervants, where many are not kept, it is a good method to have in your ſitting room, near the bell, a paper poſted, with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary articles on it, in diviſions, that are chiefly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuch as, Coals, Candles, Beer, Water, Broom, Lay the Cloth, Go to the Door, &amp;c. with a pin, to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0744100700:75"/>
which a line is fixed with a lead going down into the kitchen to a ſimilar paper fixed there; then, by fixing this pin in a hole in either of the diviſions above, the weight will drop or riſe to the ſame diviſion below. Do this before you ring your bell, and order your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to look at the index; ſhe will then know what is wanted before ſhe comes, and bring it with her. The expence of this index is trifling.</p>
               <p n="17">17. It may alſo in ſome families be worth while to have a line from the parlour to the ſtreet door, to open it without going out of the parlour. This, where there is but one ſervant, ſaves a great deal of trouble.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0744100700:89"/>The conditions of the policy and agreement are, that the aſſurance ſhall be void, if the perſon whoſe life is aſſured ſhall depart the kingdom of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or enter into the army or navy, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious conſent of the company, or ſhall die by ſuicide, duelling, or the hand of juſtice.—This corporation does not grant any annuities on lives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The terms of aſſurance at the <hi>Amicable Society,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant's-inn, Fleet-ſtreet, are as follow:—</p>
               <p>July 25, 1706, Queen Anne incorporated William, then Lord Biſhop of Oxon, Sir Thomas Aleyn, Bart. and others, and every other perſon who ſhould be then after admitted a ſubſcriber, (not exceeding 2000 in the whole) by the name of the Amicable Society, with power to purchaſe and alien lands, not exceeding the yearly value of 2000 l. to acquire any goods and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels whatſoever, to ſue, and be ſued, and to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeal.</p>
               <p>Every perſon afterwards admitted, is to be eſteemed a member of the corporation, and is to pay on his and her own life 6 l. 4 s. per annum, in ſuch manner as the directors of the ſaid corporation, for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall think fit; on whoſe deceaſe the nominee, &amp;c. is to be entitled to an equal ſhare of 10,000 l. when there are 2000 ſubſcribers, or of a ſum in proportion, if the Society ſhall conſiſt of a leſſer number.</p>
               <p>Twelve perſons were appointed directors, with power for any ſeven, or more of them, to hold courts; and the major part of them aſſembled were to manage the affairs of the corporation according to the charter, and to the by-laws to be made by the major part of the members in a general court, which court may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of leſs than twenty members; and for a ſucceſſion of directors, twelve members (living within the bills of mortality) were to be choſen yearly, within forty days after Lady-day, to be directors for one year, and until others ſhould be choſen in their places; and one of the members of the corporation was appointed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, to be ſucceeded, from time to time, by another member.</p>
               <p>January 16, 1729, George II. granted additional
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0744100700:90"/>
powers and authorities as were not contained in the original charter.</p>
               <p>No perſon can be admitted a member under the age of twelve, or above the age of forty-five years, (except in exchange) and perſons above the age of forty-three are required to procure authentic certificates of their ages.</p>
               <p>Perſons in London, or within fifteen miles thereof, muſt appear before a court of directors, and there vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily make oath, "That he or ſhe is in a good ſtate of health, and hath no diſtemper, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of his or her knowledge, judgement or belief, may tend to the ſhortening of his or her days."</p>
               <p>Perſons living above fifteen miles from London, and not appearing before a court of directors, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted members (after they are upon enquiry other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe approved of) by certificates and affidavits.</p>
               <p>Not more than three numbers or ſhares can be had upon any one life.</p>
               <p>Every perſon, on admiſſion, is to pay a premium of 7 l. 10 s. for each number or ſhare, together with 7 s. 6 d. for the policy.</p>
               <p>A dividend of 1 l. 4 s. is allowed to each member, out of the profits of the corporation, whereby the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter payment of 6 l. 4 s. is reduced to 5 l. per annum, which 5 l. is to be paid quarterly, under certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties for every ſhare.</p>
               <p>The death of every member muſt be proved by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of burial; together with an affidavit of his or her death, and identity.</p>
               <p>If a member dies out of England, ſecurity muſt be given to indemnify the corporation, before any claim is paid.</p>
               <p>Any perſon above the age of forty-five, if in good health, may be admitted in exchange for a member who is older than himſelf.</p>
               <p>By a reſolution of the general court, the 10th day of May, 1770, the claims are not to be leſs than 150 l. upon each number or ſhare; but they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably larger, as will appear by the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:

This declaration is the baſis of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between the ſociety and the perſon deſirous to make ſuch aſſurance: and if any artful, falſe, or frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent repreſentation ſhall be uſed therein, all claim, on account of any policy ſo obtained, ſhall ceaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and be void, and the monies which ſhall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0744100700:97"/>
have been paid upon account of ſuch aſſurance, ſhall be forfeited to the uſe of the ſociety.</p>
               <p>Every perſon making aſſurance with the ſociety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a member, and enters into a covenant that he will conform to, obſerve, and keep the ſtatutes, bye-laws, rules, orders, and ordinances of the ſociety.— But no member has a right to vote at a general court, who is not aſſured in the ſum of 100 l. or upwards, upon a life or lives, for the whole continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of the ſociety is conducted and carried on by fifteen directors, annually choſen out of thoſe members, who are aſſured with the ſociety in the ſum of 300 l. or upwards, upon a life or lives, for the whole continuance thereof.</p>
               <p>Four general courts are held every year, on the firſt Thurſday of March, June, September and December, or as often as nine members qualified to vote ſhall think proper, at which times the accounts and ſtate of the ſociety are laid before the perſons preſent.</p>
               <p>If at any time it ſhall appear to a General Court of the Society, that the premiums received, and to be received, will not be ſufficient to pay the claims, then the General Court are to direct a call to be made upon the ſeveral members of the Society, in proportion to the ſums by them aſſured, for making good the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; for which call credit is to be given, and the call afterwards to be repaid; with intereſt, at the rate of 3 per cent.</p>
               <p>If a call ſhould at any time be requiſite, (which is highly improbable) the members aſſured for a ſingle year will be rated towards ſuch call in the proportion of one ſixth part, and the members aſſured for a number of years certain, in the proportion of two third parts of the ſum charged upon the members aſſured for the whole continuance of life, for every 100 l. by them reſpectively aſſured.</p>
               <p>As often as it ſhall appear to a General Court, that the ſtock of the Society is more than ſufficient to pay the claims liable to be made, then the General Court is to declare a dividend of the ſurplus, or of ſuch part thereof as ſhall be judged convenient, amongſt the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0744100700:98"/>
members of the ſociety liable to contribute towards a call in proportion to the ſums in which they are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to the number of years of their ſtanding in the ſociety.</p>
               <p>The court of directors are impowered to aſſure either a groſs ſum, or an annuity, to be paid to children after they ſhall have attained an age aſſigned.</p>
               <p>The court of directors are impowered to aſſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities for a life or lives, on the payment of a groſs ſum.</p>
               <p>So as the amount of any annuity or annuities to be granted upon any <hi>one</hi> life do not exceed one hundred pounds:</p>
               <p>And towards ſecuring the payment of the ſeveral annuities, a fund is reſerved of two-thirds of the ſums originally paid for the purchaſe.</p>
               <p>There are two or three other ſocieties for aſſurance on lives, that pay annuities to widows and children, but they are not ſufficiently eſtabliſhed to put any great dependence on them, of courſe they are not here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed.</p>

               <p>AT the weſt end of the town there are no regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among porters; chairmen are chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying goods and going of errands. See CHAIRMEN, No. 18. Chairmen are very unreaſonable in their demands, they will not go a hundred yards with a letter for leſs than ſixpence, and if they go a mile they expect a ſhilling. But in the city they are under very good regulations.</p>
               <p>The city porters are divided into brotherhoods, and conſiſt of four ſorts, viz. Ticket Porters, Fellowſhip Porters, Tackle Porters, and Companies Porters.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ticket Porters are all freemen, and their buſineſs is to land and ſhip off goods, exported or imported, to all parts of America, &amp;c. alſo to houſe all merchants goods, metals, &amp;c. go of meſſages, &amp;c. They give a hundred pounds ſecurity for their fidelity and honeſty, and ſuch as employ them need only take notice of the names ſtamped on the ticket that hangs to their girdle, and on complaint made to their Governor at Founders Hall, Lothbury, ſatisfaction will be made to ſuch as they have injured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Fellowſhip Porters are employed alſo as ticket porters. Their chief Governor is the Alderman of Billingſgate Ward, to whom complaint is to be made.</p>

IN walking through London, you may always find your way, if, before you ſet out, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult a map of London, and attend to the names of the ſtreets and courts, which are always painted on a board againſt the houſes, at the corner of each ſtreet or court.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you wiſh to walk ſafe, never paſs under any goods, &amp;c. that are drawing up to the top of a houſe by a crane, nor paſs a houſe where the bricklayers are at work, leſt any thing ſhould fall on your head; it is adviſeable, on ſuch occaſions, to croſs the way: and if you would ſave your clothes, never paſs under a lamp, whilſt the lamp-lighter is triming it, nor go near any rails, &amp;c. freſh painted; or conteſt the way with a baker, barber, chimney-ſweeper, barrow-woman, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the wall or houſes are on your right hand, keep the wall and you will have no interruption, every one will give way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But don't diſpute the wall with a cart or carriage, leſt you ſhould be cruſhed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Never ſtop in a crowd, or to look at the windows of a print-ſhop or ſhew-glaſs, if you would not have your pocket picked.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Do not walk under a pent-houſe, leſt perſons watering flower-pots, or other ſlops, ſhould drop upon your head.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be careful, if you meet a porter carrying a load upon his head, that you do not get a blow that may be fatal.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you walk with an umbrella, and meet a ſimilar machine, lower yours in time, leſt you either break it, or get entangled with the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9 One ſide of the way is generally ſhady; it is not neceſſary perhaps to recommend croſſing to the ſhady ſide in ſultry weather, or keeping to windward when the duſt flies.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In wet weather look where you ſtep; if you would not be ſplaſhed, don't tread on a looſe ſtone.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0744100700:136"/>11. Don't haſtily croſs a ſtreet when a coach is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, leſt your foot ſhould ſlip and you be run over.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In froſty weather it is adviſeable to walk in the coach-ways, which are not ſo ſlippery as the foot-paths; and to bind a piece of cloth-liſt round one of your ſhoes, it will ſave you many a fall.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It is very dangerous walking in a thick fog, as you cannot ſee the danger before you; people who walk in London ſhould always look before them, both above and below.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It would be prudent for the men to have their coat-pockets open in the lining within; this will often prevent them from being picked. At leaſt every one ſhould attend to his pocket at night, or as he paſſes a crowd.</p>

               <p n="1">1. PERSONS travelling to or from London ſhould be careful not to take too much money with them. Bank poſt-bills, made payable to the holder or order, is the ſafeſt conveyance; for theſe are of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue till indorſed by the perſon they are made payable to; and if loſt, as the bank does not pay them till ſeven days after ſight, there is time to give notice of the loſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Trunks, &amp;c. ſhould not be faſtened behind car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, unleſs with chains, or unleſs ſervants ride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and will attend to them till they are ten or twelve miles from the metropolis; for there are thieves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently waiting at the outſkirts of the town, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the evening, to cut ſuch luggage from behind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If trunks, boxes, or packages are to be ſent by coaches or waggons into the country, it is prudent to let ſome perſon be preſent at the packing up, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the contents, and to take a liſt of what the trunk, &amp;c. contains. This perſon ſhould then take it to the warehouſe of the coach or waggon himſelf, and deliver it to the book-keeper, ſee it booked, and pay for the booking, which is 2 d. In this caſe, if it be loſt, you will be able to prove the contents, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the value from the owner of the coach or waggon. See STAGE-COACHES, 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But let your ſervant be very careful not to leave the trunk, &amp;c. with any perſon ſtanding at the door of the inn, or in the inn-yard; but to enquire for the book-keeper, and not part with his load till he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it into the cuſtody of the book-keeper, and ſee it booked. On this account the porter ſhould be able to read writing, to know what he is about. Rogues are very often about inn-yards, to caſe ſuch meſſengers of their loads.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such perſons as you ſend with parcels from one part of the town to another, ſhould be cautioned not to be led into a public houſe by the way, to drink with any ſuppoſed countryman, nor to ſuffer any good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0744100700:167"/>
perſon in the ſtreet, to give them a hand and help them on the way with their bundle or load; for there are many of theſe obliging people in London ſtreets, that when they get poſſeſſion of the bundle, &amp;c. will run away with it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If you hire a baſket-woman at market, or a porter to carry any thing for you home, which you may have bought, tell ſuch perſon where they are to carry it, and make them walk before you all the way. Your eye will then be upon them, and if they ſlip away from you it will he your own fault. If it be inconvenient to attend them, employ no ſuch perſon but whom you know, or is known to the perſon with whom you deal. But if you buy of a ſhop-keeper, they will always ſend the goods home.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Never ſtop in a crowd in the ſtreets, to ſee what occaſions it: if you do, it is two to one but you either loſe your watch or your pocket-handkerchief. There are fellows who create diſturbances for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Never carry any bank-notes or bills about you, without firſt entering, in ſome book at home, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and date, and particulars of ſuch notes, that in caſe you loſe them, or your pocket is picked of your book, you ſtand ſome chance of recovering them, or ſtop the payment.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Alſo enter, in ſome book at home, the number, maker's name, &amp;c. and deſcription of your watch, and whatever elſe of value you carry about you, that you may know how to deſcribe it, if loſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Never part with ſuch articles out of your hands, to perſons you are unacquainted with.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If you would walk ſafe, you would always avoid crowds, ſtopping to look at the pictures in a print-ſhop, &amp;c. See p. 115, No. 5, 14.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If by chance you ſhould drop any thing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in the ſtreet, whilſt you are looking for it, you will have many aſk you what you have loſt, and offer to aſſiſt you in the ſearch. Tell them it is nothing of any conſequence: if you acquaint them, you are likely never to find it, as they will probably find it for you and keep it.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0744100700:168"/>13. Give directions to your ſervants, on no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deliver any thing from your houſe to a ſtranger, under a pretence of your having ſent for it; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a great coat or any other thing: there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways villains ready to take advantage of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For the ſame reaſon, never let them take in a parcel for you, under an idea that it came by ſuch a carriage, if they are to pay any thing for it; for ſuch packages have been ſound to contain nothing but brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, &amp;c. In ſhort, never let them pay any thing without your knowledge or order ſo to do, to any one. Perſons bringing things will often take the money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, and aſk for it again at the houſe they carry it to.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Before you get into a hackney-coach or chair, always take the number, as, if you leave any thing therein, you may then, by ſummoning the coachman, or chairman, to the Hackney-coach office, probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it. They may ſay they never ſaw it, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly their next fare might find it and take it: poſſibly ſo. This is a lie, for they always look, when they ſet down a fare, before they ſhut the door. To be truly ſafe in this matter, every one ſhould look round the coach or chair before they quit it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Thieves have lately made a practice of knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at doors in an evening, under a pretence of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a letter, and, when the door is open, if in a retired place, have ruſhed in, in numbers, and robbed the family. To avoid this, a chain ſhould be always put acroſs the door within, (ſo as to admit the door to open a little way) before duſk, and the door not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſtranger, but the letter, if any, taken in.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If you do not ſit in your front-parlour in an evening, take care the windows are faſtened down, for men have been known to enter a houſe this way, ſecrete themſelves till the family is aſleep, and then rob the houſe; or they have robbed that room only, while the family have been backwards, and decamped the ſame way.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If the houſe next door to you is empty, be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0744100700:169"/>
the upper windows; for villains will now and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete themſelves in ſuch empty houſes, and, in the night, get into the adjoining houſe, by the back-doors or windows, or from the leads. Your garret-windows therefore ſhould always be ſecured, and trap-doors opening to the leads well bolted.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Before you come out of any play-houſe, or place of public entertainment, take care to ſecure your watch and your pockets, for pick-pockets are always about at ſuch places.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Never ſuffer any beggars to be begging at your door, particularly if you live in any retired place, for, under a pretence of begging, if they ſee no one in the way, they will be ſure to rob you of ſomething.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Do not ſuffer yourſelf to be impoſed on by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars in the ſtreets, for they have all their arts, and will affect diſtreſs to excite your humanity; if you have any thing to give, it would be beſt beſtowed to poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed families; it is a miſtaken charity to give to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars in the ſtreets, whom the laws have provided for.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Auctions in great thorough-fares, in the day-time, where men ſtand at the door and invite paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are great impoſitions. Slight ill-made goods are made up for ſuch auctions, and if you buy, it is ten to one but you are cheated, and give twice the value of the article purchaſed. Never buy at an auction, but where the auctioneer is known to be a reputable man. At auctions of linen-drapery, they will put, perhaps, ſufficient painted muſlin for a gown, and a piece of dowlas, worth 7 d. a yard, and ſell the two at one price per yard; from an opinion that there may not be above thirty yards of dowlas, you bid accordingly, but, when meaſured, there ſhall be ſixty, of courſe you are deceived and cheated.</p>
               <p n="23">23. For the ſame reaſon, never buy at a pawn-brokers ſuch articles as they diſplay at their windows; for a notion of buying things cheap, has drawn many to buy at theſe places; and this has led the pawn-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to get things made up purpoſely for ſale, in a ſlight manner. Half the things at their windows are new, and ſold as ſecond-hand.</p>
               <p n="24">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0744100700:170"/>24. Indeed, in purchaſing, it will be always ſound beſt to purchaſe of, and employ people of credit, though you pay rather a greater price, for they have a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter at ſtake, and will uſe you well, in hopes of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your cuſtom in future; but if you buy in general of thoſe who underſell the fair trader, and advertiſe things at a very low price, depend upon it, unleſs you are a very good judge of the articles you buy, and take eſpecial care, you will be taken in.</p>
               <p n="25">25. People in diſtreſs are always wanting to borrow money, and hold out advantageous terms in advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to lenders. Be ever on your guard in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo againſt thoſe who publicly, by adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, offer to raiſe money on ſecurities. They will get the ſecurities into their hands, ſuch as bonds, notes, &amp;c. and will frequently ſhuffle you out of them. To theſe the public have given the denomination of ſwindlers. If you are in trade, be cautious how you are taken in by cuſtomers you are a ſtranger to. There are a number of people in town, who live by getting goods on credit, and taking in the incautious ſhop-keeper.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Be very circumſpect and cautious of having any thing to do with notes of hand or accepted drafts, drawn by people you are unacquainted with, for it is by ſuch modes that the unwary are duped and robbed of their property.</p>
               <p n="27">27. If you keep an open ſhop, never ſuffer a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to leave a parcel in your ſhop, (under a pretence of having further to go, and wiſhing it to be taken care of till his return) unleſs you know the contents of the parcel. Men have been known to leave contraband goods, in this manner, and go and inform againſt the ſhop-keeper, in order to get the penalty. In like manner, a ſack of unroaſted coffee has been left at a grocer's, and he has been exchequered in conſequence of it.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Never ſtep in between perſons quarrelling in the ſtreet, unleſs you chuſe to have your pocket picked. Theſe are often ſham-quarrels, to collect people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the opportunity of plundering them.</p>
               <p n="29">

               <p n="30">30. Where perſons, by fraud in gaming, win above 10 l. they ſhall forfeit five times the value, and ſuffer ſuch corporal puniſhment as in caſes of wilful perjury. 9 Ann. c. 14.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Shop-keepers ſhould be on their guard againſt perſons coming in and looking over a great quantity of goods, without purchaſing. Sharpers often, making a genteel appearance, will take an opportunity, on theſe occaſions, when the ſhop-keeper's back is turned, to pilſer and purloin.</p>
               <p n="32">32. In return, buyers ſhould always be careful that they are not impoſed on by ſhop-keepers, for they will often ſurvey you from head to foot, and aſk a price ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their cuſtomer. They will often aſk 10 s. for an article at a coach-ſide, which they will ſell for, to a perſon on foot, for half the money.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Shop-keepers who have the reputation of ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cheap, will evidently do ſo, in ſome ſmall articles, the price of which every buyer is acquainted with; but they take care to bring up the <hi>lee-way,</hi> as the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's phraſe is, and make you pay handſomely in other things. In ſhort, every tradeſman muſt live, and there are ſuch numbers of the ſame profeſſion in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that they are obliged to make uſe of a variety of artifices to get cuſtom; and the buyer, with all his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs and care, ſhall not often be able to avoid being taken in.</p>
               <p n="34">34. It often happens, that if a parcel is ſent in from the country, by a waggon, and ordered to be left till called for, and you ſend for it, that they will tell you no ſuch thing is brought, and then the porter of the inn will bring it, in order to get a ſhilling or two: in this caſe give him nothing, but before you give him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo, take poſſeſſion of it, otherwiſe he will take it back again: ſhould this fellow, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, if any game is ſent you, and not ordered to be delivered, not bring it, and it ſpoils, and the maſter of the waggon does not diſcharge him, ſummon the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Court of Conſcience, for the value of the thing ſpoilt, and you will be never ſerved ſo again.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0744100700:172"/>
Porters of inns are in general very exorbitant in their demands, and very inſolent. If they aſk too much for bringing a thing, never pay it, but tell them they may take it back again, and you will ſend for it.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Perſons would do well to be careful of their hats in public companies; for want of ſuch care, many a perſon has brought home an old hat for a new one.

               <p>There is a Society of Tradeſmen, &amp;c. inſtituted in 1767, for the protection of their property againſt the inroads of felons, forgers, cheats, &amp;c. and to ſave the charges of proſecutions, rewards and advertiſements, which are paid out of the public ſtock, raiſed annually at five ſhillings each member; which ſubſcription, tho' ſmall, has not only been found ſufficient for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes intended, but has enabled the Society to veſt a ſum in the funds, beſides leaving a conſiderable balance in the treaſurer's hands.</p>

               <p n="11">11. When the party has been ſerved with an order, if he does not attend, the court adjudges the debt due to the plaintiff, and an execution is taken out, which ſeizes either the goods or the perſon of the debtor, and unleſs the money is then paid, and the coſts, he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to priſon.</p>

At the courts in Vine-ſtreet, and Caſtle-ſtreet, the price of a ſummons is 8 d. of an order 2 s. 2 d. of a hearing, after the delivery of a ſummons, 2 s. 2 d. of a hearing after the ſerving of an order, 1 s. 3 d. the coſt of an execution is 2 s. 6 d. and the plaintiff's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his money 8 d. All the coſts, except the laſt 8 d. the defendant is obliged to re-pay.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The day of hearing at the court at Fullwood's Rents is Thurſday; the Judge of this court is the County Clerk, who acts by deputy.

Theſe the defendants pay in the end, and the plaintiff can receive his money with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fee.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The determinations of the Courts of Conſcience are final, but they generally indulge the debtor with time to pay the money, if he requeſts it. They will ſuffer him to pay it at a ſhilling or ſix-pence a week; this money muſt be regularly paid into the court, or an attachment againſt the party iſſues; and when the time elapſes in which the whole debt is paid, the plaintiff applies to the court for his money, and receives it on paying a few pence.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The plaintiffs and defendants in theſe courts are in general people ſo very low, that a gentleman would ſooner loſe 40 s. than attend them. If he is a defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, it is beſt to get ſome perſon to attend for him; if plaintiff, and can prove his demand, he may even then get ſome perſon to apply for him; but if he cannot prove his debt otherwiſe than by his own oath, he ſhould attend himſelf, for if he has no other proof, the plaintiff's oath is always ſufficient. Of courſe, it is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0744100700:176"/>
better in theſe courts to be plaintiff than defendant, for if the plaintiff ſwears to his debt, no oath of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant will avail him.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In order to recover in theſe courts, the debt muſt be under 40 s. (at leaſt the claim muſt), and both parties muſt reſide in London. The ſummons muſt be taken out in that court in whoſe diſtrict the defendant lives.</p>
               <p n="18">18. No oath is required on taking out the ſummons, nor is it neceſſary to ſpell the defendant's name right, or know his chriſtian name; all that is required is to know where he is to be found, that the ſummons may be left at his place of reſidence; if the party will not attend by a ſummons, it is neceſſary to get the chriſtian name of the defendant, in order to obtain an order, and if he is a houſekeeper this is readily got at, by applying to the veſtry-clerk of the pariſh where he lives, and examining the poors-rate book.</p>

               <p>IS that ground about White-hall and St. James's, which belongs to the crown, and which is privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged from arreſts. This privileged place includes Charing-croſs, on the north ſide of the way, from the' corner of St. Martin's-lane to Hedge-lane, and both the King's meuſes. On the ſouth ſide, from the ſtreet leading into Spring-gardens, to the public houſe beyond the Treaſury, and all Spring-gardens; on the oppoſite ſide of the way, from Northumberland-houſe to the end of Privy-garden in Parliament-ſtreet, taking in all Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-yard, Whitehall, and Privy-garden. It further includes all the parks, the ſtable-yard St. James's, Cleveland-court, and all Hyde-park, except the mere croſſing from the Green-park to Hyde-park. Moſt houſes in the Verge let lodgings, and I knew an artful fellow once that eluded all his creditors, by reſiding there; if he wanted to go out of it, he took water at Whitehall-ſtairs, which place is privileged, and as no writ can be ſerved on the water, without a water-bailiff's warrant, which cannot be immediately procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he would land ſafely in the city, or on the Surry ſide: for a Middleſex writ loſes its force in the city, and in Surry, unleſs backed by a city or Surry magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, which requires time and preparation to get done; ſo that, if he landed in Surry, he might take his horſe and ride to the land's-end, or he would occaſionally walk through the parks, and order his horſe to wait for him on the oppoſite ſide. By this means, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly eluded the ſheriff's officers, who could not be in every place, or eternally watching him.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

or in a limited period, be approved, they will ſuffer him to continue in the Verge, but if they find him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to act fraudulently, they will tell him that the Verge ſhall not ſhelter him; and if he does not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quit it, they will order him to be arreſted by their own officer; but, let the caſe be as it will, they always give him notice to quit the place, and give him a reaſonable time to do it in; but if he can make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with any of the gentlemen of the Board, he meets with favour there, as a man does in all ſituations of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſheriff's-officer arreſting a man in the Verge, will be puniſhed by an application to the Board of Green Cloth, and the perſon arreſted will be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

               <p>By this eſtimate, the expences are leſs than keeping them in your own ſtable. To be ſure, you have none of the coachman's ſervice but that of driving, but then, on the other hand, you are not liable to loſe the uſe of your carriage by accidents attending the horſes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to keep a chariot and pair of horſes properly, three horſes ſhould be kept for the purpoſe; and this advantage you have by hiring a job.
