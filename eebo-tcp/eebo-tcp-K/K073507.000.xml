            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>True, madam! <hi>Watcher</hi> is confined, but this confinement is rather form than reality.—And if he was of that ſeditious ſpirit that we attribute to him, he has friends enough at his nod, to ſhake the pillars, not of his p—n only, but the p—e too.—And it is from ſome violent attempt of that ſort, that my beſt hopes are at preſent founded.—But I fear he has too much penetration for us all;—for altho' he ſuſtains the ſpirit of the multitude, he artfully reſtrains their impetuoſity.—As for the j—s—I hope they lean to our ſide, but the ſagacity of <hi>Manſupple</hi> is ſo guarded, that he'll do nothing raſhly—the beſt ſervices he will do for us, muſt have, at leaſt, the countenance of l—.—The m—y are no doubt at our devotion; but even with reſpect to them, I am under ſome difficulties—there's Lord <hi>Shelter</hi> rides

                     <hi>Watcher</hi> does by no means either ſeduce or inflame them.—They are ſenſible that it is on account of his firm attachment to them, and to the juſt influence he has got amongſt them, that the reſentment of a—n ſo keenly perſecutes him; they juſtly think, if they were to leave him to lie neglected in a priſon, where he's confined for their ſakes, it would be the height of ingratitude.—This leads numbers of them ſucceſſively to ſhew their perſonal gratitude, by which they imagine they keep up his ſpirits—This is poiſon to his perſecutors.—They make a parade of g—s, c—s, &amp;c.—Such parades always gather abundance of idlers; and the indifferent, and the intereſted mingling together, look like a concourſe of people, and are howſoever quiet, branded with the name of mob!—The ſcheme of g—t is to deter every body from ſo much as looking at him.—In hopes, by procraſtinating his trial as they do, from day to day, that the people will at length be tired out, and ſo deſert him:—But to blame him with any fatal conſequences, is juſt as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as it would be to blame me.—If I ſent out a ſhip to purchaſe wealth to the nation, and if by the miſmanagement of the maſter or pilot, the ſhip ſhould be loſt—the loſs of that ſhip's crew may, I ſay, be as juſtly imputed to me, as the murders of this day can be imputed to honeſt <hi>Jack Watcher.</hi>

                  <p>Proofs, in ſuch a caſe cannot be poſitive, becauſe corruption ſeldom admits of evidence.—But never was any caſe ſupported by ſo ſtrong preſumptive proof.—During his ſervice in p—t, his vigilance and activity could not eſcape the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the m—s.—We all know that many, with not the half of his talents, were bought off at a very high price, and his continuing ſo long unplaced, and unpenſioned, is a convincing teſtimony to me, that he was not to be purchaſed.—In the next place, when through him, ſuch a wound was given to the <hi>native liberty of E</hi>—! can you ſuppoſe that any <hi>ſon of corruption</hi> would have, in defence of it, undergone ignominious trials, and ſuffered impriſonment, when doubtleſs he could have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both, by letting the ſtab which <hi>liberty</hi> had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, paſs unnoticed! Would not the m—y, think you, have paid him a very high price; rather than have ſubmitted to the diſgrace he brought upon them, and their emiſſaries? and yet did he not, as advocate for the <hi>public,</hi> peril his freedom and fortune, rather than yield one inch of <hi>theirs?</hi>

                  <p>As for the ſeditious part of it, <hi>Honeſty</hi> has too much good ſenſe not to grant me, that the ſpeeches put into the mouths of the beſt of k—s by wicked m—rs, have before <hi>Watcher's</hi> time been as freely handled, and not a word ſaid about it.—As to the accuſation of impiety—I am ſorry he is liable to the imputation.—But I will no more admit that he was guilty of a publication in that caſe; than if you was to ſhew me a witty poem; however wild it might be, of which I ſhould wiſh for a copy, and you ſhould conſent to let me take one, on condition that I would furniſh you with two or three.—The peruſal of free thoughts on religious ſubjects, is only dangerous to the morals of mankind when they fall into the hands of weak heads, incapable of diſtinguiſhing between right and wrong.—When they come into the hands of men of ſenſe, they will be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and expoſe their errors, and thereby do rather ſervice than harm to the truth.—And as it is impoſſible to conceive that ever the piece in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was deſigned for the public eye, as I can't help thinking that a moſt abſurd verdict which pronounced it to be a publication; and by that means ſubjected the <hi>undeſigning copier</hi> to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to a criminal publiſher.</p>

                  <p>Why, I'll tell thee <hi>Honeſty.</hi>—I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what are in reality the ſentiments of <hi>Watcher</hi> himſelf—In the beginning of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours here—popular appearances were neceſſary for

him, to ſupply the defections of thoſe affected pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots who had formerly flattered him with their eternal protection.—He found, after he had riſked all, and ſpent all, in purſuit of the very ſchemes they had concerted with him, that they had fallen off, and become ſo luke-warm, that unleſs he ſhould be able to inſpirit the public with a juſt ſenſe of his and their own oppreſſions, he muſt fall a ſacrifice to real merit—he therefore, did not at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their cabals; but as no man is more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than he, to preſerve order and harmony in the community, and knowing very well the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of popular fury; he has laboured with as much zeal to moderate their reſentments, as he nobly intends to employ for the redreſs of their grievances!</p>

                  <p>Not entirely abandoned him,—that's what for their own ſakes, at leaſt for the ſake of that popularity on which they would ſtill fain plume themſelves; they dare hardly do.—They continue I believe to contribute towards his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence—but for his noble and ſpirited meaſures, they leave him to ſtruggle through them the beſt way he can.—They will not conſent, I imagine, that he be too rigorouſly handled; but they will as little concur with him in bringing to juſtice thoſe tools of A—n who have diſgraced and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nation, to aggrandize themſelves, and to cruſh the efforts of true patriotiſm.</p>

                     <hi>Chatwell</hi>'s degeneracy does by no means ſurprize me, I have ever lookt upon him to be the vaineſt of all men!—his beſt hopes were, from the beginning, founded in the people's applauſe; that he courted; that he obtained; and he has made a good account of it.—The amazing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which crown'd his a—n, made him the idol of the people, who would not ſee how greedily he adorned himſelf with ornaments of which he often ſpoiled the real purchaſer; no man in theſe days dared to contradict him, and he therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed every glory to himſelf.</p>
