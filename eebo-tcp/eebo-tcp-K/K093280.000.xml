            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ZAPHANIEL'S Exhortation to his Fellows in the Faith.</head>
            <p>THOSE vain tale-bearing Books, entitled Memoirs, have ſo far ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Readers, that the truth is to them but a threadbare Garment.</p>
            <p>Unſatisfied are they with each Hiſtory, unleſs the Writer delivereth all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, concerning every Perſon whom he memorialiſes; from the Colour of an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brow, even unto the Pattern of a Shoe-buckle.</p>
            <p>Since therefore it accordeth, that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators muſt uſe ſuch Preciſion; enforced am I to extend my Plan, the primitive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0187700100:5"/>Deſign of which was no more, than to repeat the Spirit-moving Diſcourſes, that preceded this Play Actor, and comical Comedians Regeneration; which were utter'd unto him, by the great Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> the good Mr. <hi>Weſley,</hi> the pious Mr. <hi>Bradbury,</hi> and the learned Mr. <hi>Romaine.</hi> But now it behoveth me, for expediting the Sale of my Book, to give an Account of his Birth, Parentage, Education, Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Behaviour. Yet, for as much as it doth not, in any Sort, ſuit me to deliver thoſe Hiſtorialiſms, according to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Times, I have agreed with a Scribe of this Town, vulgarly called a Wit; and he hath undertaken to Dreſs theſe Anecdotes, in all the faſhionable Language of fine fangled Phraſes, for the Peruſal of the Publick.</p>

SCENE the FIRST.</head>
               <stage>DANCING MASTER. EDITOR. ZAPHANIEL.</stage>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE afternoon as I was preparing a Political Eſſay, for the next day's Chronicle, in anſwer to a letter, I had inſerted the week before, on the other ſide the queſtion, the boy from the blue poſts, ſaid, two gentlemen wanted me at his maſter's.</p>
               <p>My dear wife, whoſe prudence, and perſon, are unequalled, was unwilling I ſhould go; but upon recollection, I ventured (not without ſome neceſſary precaution, I muſt confeſs) and was inducted into a room, where two very well look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men were ſeated.</p>
               <p>The ſhorteſt of them was dreſſed in a laced coat, a fine flowered gold and ſilver waiſtcoat, figured Ruffles, a heart at his ſhirt boſom made of green and red ſtones; he had a ſword and a bunch of ribbands at the handle, and he held a ſnuff-box in his hand.</p>
               <p>As his complexion was of the olive tint, his eyes vacant, his noſtrils charged with rappee, and his eye-brows, forehead, and other parts of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0187700100:8"/>his face, indicating he much practiſed the look contemptuous, I took him for ſome foreign no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, juſt imported: but he was a figure danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the Opera-houſe; and thus he opened the buſineſs to me.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>DANCING MASTER.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, we have taken the liberty to ſend for you; becauſe we hear you are an author. That gentleman <stage>(pointing to his friend, who wore his own dark brown hair, parted on the top of his head, and ſmòothly ſtroked down each ſide of his temples, then tucked behind his ears, as you have ſeen window curtains turned back)</stage> Mr. Zaphaniel has got ſome very curious ſtories relating to a particular play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but he wants to have them put into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtile.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>DANCING MASTER.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay as to that, Sir, it will be left to you. I have nothing to ſay to ſtile, for <hi>my</hi> part.—Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen like me never read. I never looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Book in my life.—I keep my chariot, Sir, and people now-a-days, don't keep their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots by book reading.</p>

                  <speaker>DANCING MASTER.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, Ay, as drole as you can, faith—touch up all the actors and ſingers in it. They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to be made game with; as to the dancers, you may let them alone, only if you can cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly throw in any hints about myſelf, for I teach moſt of the people of faſhion in town, I am indecd the beſt dancer either for execution or addreſs, or ſchool buſineſs, in Europe. I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0187700100:9"/>hate vanity—but I'll tell you more of myſelf, when you come to dine with me.—Where's the papers, Zaffy?</p>

NANCY you muſt know, Sir, is a wench he's a friend to, for the fellow faith has a deviliſh ſmart ſort of a genius for high life; although he is but a player, he keeps his girl, wears embroidery, drinks burned cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, and betts his 50 as freely, as if he was the beſt nobleman, or dáncing maſter in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>DANCING MASTER.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt know, Sir, there is no doing any good in the world, without puffing. It does not ſignify, if you are the clevereſt fellow that can be, in your way, without you can puff your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf off, or get your friends to puff you off, you will never get forwards; for it is not now the queſtion, whether an artiſt is a genius? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0187700100:10"/>he is in faſhion? Now there are ſeveral ways of managing this bringing a man into faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; ſome chuſe to bribe a very great lady's hair-dreſſer; others get into faſhion 'cauſe their fathers have a vote, or their ſiſter a pretty face, or they were born on this ſide, or that ſide Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-bridge; or, becauſe—becauſe—in ſhort, Sir, there are many ſchemes, but I don't like any of them half ſo well, as printing your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the news papers, or writing a book about it.</p>
                  <p>I was let into the ſecret by my maſter, who got all his money by advertiſing. For, as he ſaid, never mind what other people ſay, do you ſay as much as you can for yourſelf; and keep at it; and if you will go on telling the town, ſo you will talk them into it, until they believe every ſyllable about you.</p>
                  <p>The MSS. I took home with me, and, being promiſed ready money, began to digeſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials immediately.</p>

                  <p>Thus was Mr. Thomas Ap Morgan, a Welch chairman, very vehemently telling his mind to David Llwhyddwhuydd, his partner. David mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replying, you know, my dear countryman, that now I am the very laſt, look you, of all the Llwhyddwhuydds in all Wales, and will any countryman of mine, any true Briton, and there are no true Britons but Welch folks, you know, Thomas.</p>

                     <p>Yes, to be ſure I do, and thank God for that, I am but a Welchman truly, but I am a true Briton, and Britons never will be ſlaves; and therefore why ſhould your wife want to bite my noſe then?</p>

                     <p>Why they went on board ſhip with Captain Noah, and the ſhip ſettled upon a very high mountain, and the mountain was Penmanmuir, and Wales was the firſt place peopled again; and Japhet married into our family, and I have ſome of his blood now in my veins, and our family has been in Merionethſhire ever ſince. Now here lies the point, my dear. Suppoſe my ſon, becauſe my wife ſhould loſe her longing, is to be born without a noſe, or <stage>(God help us)</stage> with two noſes now; for great authors ſay, that a woman with child, when ſhe longs, or is affrighted the effects will be the ſame upon the child.</p>

                  <p>CASE. I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> relates, that a woman in Sicily obſerving a lobſter taken by a fiſherman, and being moved by an earneſt longing for it, brought forth a lobſter, altogether like what ſhe had ſeen and longed for.—Vide the copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Is told by <hi>John Swammerdam.</hi> A certain woman at Utrecht, being with child, was frighted with the ſight of a negro, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be delivered of a perfect black; but at laſt recollecting herſelf, ſhe made uſe of a ſecond imagination, to prevent the danger from the firſt; for ſhe waſhed herſelf from head to foot, with hot water, to clear the child from blackneſs. The time of her delivery being
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0187700100:15"/>come, the child was born with all his teeth, and appeared perfectly white, except thoſe places, the hot water did not reach.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. By ditto. A child was born in Normandy with horns upon his head, and cloven feet, and he proved afterwards to be a man of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſenſe and judgment: the occaſion of that misfortune was, that his father having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a ſatyr upon the ſtage, had the knowledge of his wife in that ridiculous dreſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We have a caſe in <hi>Fabricius Hildanus,</hi> upon the faith of <hi>Ludovicus Horniceus,</hi> a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Frankfort, viz. a woman having been frighted with the firing of a gun, was delivered of a child with a wound in the back, of the ſame ſhape, as if it had been done with a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet ſhot.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Father <hi>Malebranche,</hi> in his ſearch after truth, relates, that ſeven or eight years ago, was ſeen in the hoſpital of incurables a young man, who was born an idoet; and whoſe body was broken in the ſame places where malefactors are broke; he had lived near twenty years in that condition, and has been ſeen by ſeveral perſons. The cauſe was, his mother hearing a criminal was to be broke, went to ſee the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Malebranche</hi> proceeds to explain this ſtrange accident: children, ſays he, ſee what their mothers ſee; they hear the ſame cries, they receive the ſame impreſſions of the objects, and are moved by the ſame paſſions; all the blows given to the malefactor did violently ſtrike the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0187700100:16"/>mother's imagination; and by the counterblow, the tender and ſoft brain of the child.—The fibres of the child's brain, not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the torrent of the ſpirits, were broken; that's the reaſon why he came into the world without underſtanding. The violent courſe of the mother's animal ſpirits went with force from her brains to the ſeveral parts of her body, which anſwered to the parts of the malefactor: 'twas the ſame in the child—but becauſe the bones of the mother were capable to reſiſt the violence of the ſpirits, they were not wounded. But this rapid ſtream of the ſpirits was capable to carry away the ſoft and tender parts of the bones of the child; and 'tis to be obſerved, that if the mother had determined the motion of the ſpirits, toward any other part of the body, her child had not had his bones broke; but that part which anſwered to the part towards which the mother determined her ſpirits had been ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. A gentlewoman of Helſenor, ſays <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholin,</hi> was delivered of a great cat; which, to the aſtoniſhment of the aſſiſtants, ran away with great celerity, and was never ſeen afterwards—becauſe the lady was frightened with one.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>Bartholin</hi> alſo relates; I have it, he ſays from <hi>John Naborouſky,</hi> a gentleman of Poland, and my good friend, that a woman of that country was brought to bed of two ſmall fiſhes, without ſcales; which were no ſooner born, but they ſwam in the neighbouring waters, as naturally as others do; becauſe the lady did long for them; ſo that you ſee, my friend Thomas,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0187700100:17"/>look you, it is all the ſame, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of theſe learned people, whether a lady is frighted, or whether a lady longs.</p>

                     <p>Well, let us hear ſome more ſtories, in the Name of God.—I do love to hear ſuch things, to be ſure; but God help me, for my own ſake, but to be ſure I cannot believe all theſe things, ſo well as the ſcholars do, becauſe I have not their learning; but go on, do my friend, do go on. <stage>Which requeſt David obeyed immediately.</stage>

                  <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Philippus Meurs,</hi> apoſtolical prothono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and cannon of St. Peter's in Louvain, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend ancient man, affirmed unto me, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, ſays our author, <hi>Thomas Fienus,</hi> that he had a ſiſter compleat in the reſt of her body, but without a head. Inſtead of which, was joined to her neck a ſhell fiſh, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſea-muſcle, made up of two ſhells, which ſhut and opened; and by which, from a ſpoon, ſhe took her nouriſhment. And this he ſaid was occaſioned, for that the mother with child with her had a ſtrong deſire after ſome muſcles ſhe beheld in the market, but could not procure at that inſtant. This ſiſter of his lived in this monſtrous condition, to be eleven years old; and then, by accident, happening angrily, and very ſtrongly, to bite the ſpoon they fed her with, and breaking the ſhells, died quickly after.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. <hi>Schenkius</hi> tells of a woman very big; who, among other diſcourſes with her neighbours, mention being made of her great belly, ſhe told them, ſhe reckoned about the time of Epiphany,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0187700100:18"/>or feſtival of the three kings. Upon which the good woman wiſhing ſhe might bring forth three kings; ſhe merrily anſwered, with all her heart; and accordingly, at the time, ſhe bore three ſons; one of them an Ethiopian, or of a black colour, as uſually one of thoſe kings are painted. The ſame relation is confirmed by <hi>Cornel. Gemma,</hi> being ſeen, as he ſays, by great multitudes, in the city of Louvain, and authenticated by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted teſtimony.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. There was a lady, a kinſwoman of mine, ſays Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> who uſed much to wear black patches upon her face (a faſhion among young women) which I, to put her from, uſed to tell her in jeſt, that the next child ſhe ſhould go with, ſhould come into the world with a great black ſpot in the midſt of its forehead; and the apprehenſion was ſo lively in her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that ſhe had a daughter born, and marked juſt as the mother had fancied, with a great black ſpot upon her.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. There lived amongſt us at Bern in Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, ſays <hi>Gul. Fabricius,</hi> an honeſt woman, who, about ten years ſince, being great with child, and quarrelling with another woman, put herſelf into ſuch a paſſion, that ſhe was unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain herſelf. After which, falling into labour, ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and heroick mind, but her feet and hands contracted, as if ready to fight, and her whole body in continual motion, ſo that ſhe walks, as it were, dancing, and in a trembling poſture, after the manner of angry people, unable to govern their paſſion.</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0187700100:19"/>XII. <hi>Amb. Parey</hi> gives us to underſtand, that in the year 1517, a child was born (in a village near Fontainbleau) with the ſhape of its face exactly like that of a frog; which was brought to paſs by the mother's holding that creature in her hand, to allay the heat of a fever, about the time of her conception.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. But ſomething ſingular beyond all theſe, is the tale of <hi>Languis,</hi> of a woman longing to bite the naked ſhoulder of a baker paſſing by her; which, rather than ſhe ſhould loſe her longing, the good-natured huſband hired the baker at a certain price. Accordingly, when the big-bellied woman had bit twice, the baker's wife broke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the people who held her, would not ſuffer her to bite her huſband again; for want of which, ſhe bore one dead child, with two living ones.</p>
                  <p>Why then, I ſay (thus Thomas very loudly began, hitting his hand hard upon the table) I ſay, the baker was—.</p>
                  <p>At that inſtant a voice from the ſtreet called chair, chair; out run Mr. David and Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, the book, the noſe, the wife, were in an inſtant forgot; for the occult deſire of money-getting annihilates all other conſiderations, as black abſorbs all factitious colours.</p>
                  <p>How the chairman came to be ſo learned (as we all love to know every thing) courteous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, you ſhall, if you pleaſe, be informed.</p>
                  <p>Upwards of twenty years had he taken in the Magazines, and had made ſo many abſtracts, and remembered ſo many extracts, that if he had

                  <p>He was the living Lexicon, to which the whiſt and jockey clubs applied, whenever they made a bett about ſpelling a word; and he had, from obſervation, acquired ſuch a genius or power in diſputation, that all ſmatterers he ſilenced, as eaſily as Socrates did the Sophiſts; if a true ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar happened to contradict him, David, from his knowledge of the world, dumfounded the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by offering him ten pound on't; for he proceeded upon one general, and not an often controverted principle, <hi>i. e.</hi> no rich men will mind learning; <hi>ergo,</hi> only poor folks are ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>Therefore every fool, every dunce, dares to aſſert, to contradict, to find fault, or praiſe; even with the utmoſt ignorant effrontery, and oppoſe the opinions of men of real merit—blockheads having one undeniable reſource, the propoſing a wager.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd, maſter Neddy's mama, was born in America, the daughter of a mulatto woman, her papa, the famous councellor Juſtice, who was ſent abroad on account of ſome books being miſſing. The grandfather's diſgrace is the reaſon why none of his deſcendants ever choſe to learn their letters.</p>
                  <p>Hence, as <hi>Heinſius</hi> obſerves, it is very eaſy to account for the Hero of this Hiſtory being illiterate.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Juſtice was imported under-cook to a Weſt-Indian family, who came to England for improvement; they hired a fine houſe the ſouth ſide of Maidſtone, within half a mile exactly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0187700100:22"/>of the market-place, and on the right-hand of the London road.</p>

                  <p>In Maidſtone, at this time, there was a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Comedians, that town and county being remarkable for the reſidence of ſuch ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

                  <p>In all rural theatrical communities, it is the cuſtom of one of the actors to carry play-bills to the people of faſhion's houſes about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and as theſe Jamaica gentlefolks were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for ſumptuous living, the manager caſt himſelf into that part of the buſineſs; this occaſioned much murmuring when his back was turned, among the reſt of the company; they would meet at the ale-houſe, and call him all the ſcoundrels, and tyrants imaginable; but the moment they ſaw him returning, they run out of the room, begged he would drink with them, and happy was he; who could get his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief out firſt, to wipe the duſt off from his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's ſhoes. He loved, like moſt of his brethren, eleemoſinary high living, therefore he never miſſed carrying up a bill every morning to the Weſt Indian ſquires; and uſed to wait in the hall, at firſt, along with the butcher's boy, to know their honours commands.</p>

                  <p>He ſpoke Tragedy ſpeeches to them, he ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them tricks, he made them faces, he ſung ſongs, he acted the lame man, and the ſtutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, and ſtood upon his head, and drank out of his ſhoe, no man had more wit than he had; and he rehearſed all the other comicalities, by which benefit-making geniuſes puſh their tickets off. The young lady above-mentioned fell in love with this maſter actor, his name, or at leaſt the name he went by, was Samly; and as Mr. Samly was ſeeing Miſs Juſtice home from the play-houſe, in about a week afterwards, ſhe confeſſed her affection to him, and informed him, that ſhe had forty nine pounds of her own, and in her own poſſeſſion, all in ſpecie.</p>
                  <p>Samly immediately fell in love with her, they vowed eternal fidelity to each other, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thoſe vows by the moſt particular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before they went out of the home cloſe, while the bright ſtars in the fiery fretted canopy of heaven ſparkled over their heads, and the ſilent gloworms twinkled at their ſides, the leafy hedges ruſtling to their embraces, and the whoping owls at diſtance toot tooting to their ſighs (as Mr. Samly obſerved) made up great nature's loving concert. The next week, unknown to any of their acquaintance, they ſet out for London together; Samly left his cloaths and ſcenes behind him; indeed they were mortgag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0187700100:25"/>for rather more than the worth, to the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord of the ſtable in which they acted.</p>
                  <p>The Editor of this Treatiſe remembers this Mr. Samly's company at Maidſtone, and they had the uſe of a brewhouſe to ſhift their cloaths in; the ladies dreſſing-place was the maſh-tub, and Alexander the Great, he has known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe his mad ſcene very cleverly in the cooler.</p>
                  <p>The brace of lovers determined to remain in cog for ſome time in London; becauſe, as Miſs Juſtice ſaid, what would all the world think of her, if all the world ſhould come to know it? therefore deſired Mr. Samly would get a licence as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                  <p>Reſuming his ſubject, thus he went on—<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the winter comes on, thou opening roſe of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we'll take a ready furniſhed houſe in ſome of the genteel ſquares about Piccadilly. But firſt, I'll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with myſelf, which Theatre I chuſe to belong to.—A man of my merit, my lovely attractreſs, will be careſſed by the managers of both houſes; ſo I'll play them off one againſt t'other; promiſe them both, and at laſt, who bids moſt has me. I know my cue—but I am reſolved never to come upon the ſquare of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0187700100:26"/>common ſalary actors; no, I will have ſo much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when I play, or elſe ſuch a ſum of money out of the houſe as a ſharer, and this way</hi>—(hitching up his breeches at the ſame time) <hi>this way I ſhall, keep up my conſequence; and conſequence is what an actor ought to ſtudy, as much, ay, and more than his parts.</hi> But it happened to Mr. Samly, as it may have to thee, reader, his expectations were ſuperior to his advancement; the managers of both Theatres refuſed him.</p>
                  <p>His caſe was very ſevere, he had a great mind to print it, to let the town know how he was uſed; he did ſo, but it did not anſwer any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the public took no notice of it, and the bookſeller loſt money by it.</p>
                  <p>His lady's fortune being ſoon diſſipated, duns grew exceedingly impertinent, misfortunes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves before him, in all the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phantoms of hunger, bad ſhoes, bum bailiffs, rainy weather, no truſt, and an empty coal-hole; he curſed the pride of managers, their ignorance, their inhumanity; he damned the town, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed life, he grew deſperate; and one morning, before the fringed covering of his lady's eye-lights were withdrawn, he went down ſtairs, and opening the ſtreet-door, he, I am afraid it will never be believed, but the fact is authentic, and I can bring ſeveral reputable people to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the truth of it,—he, that very morning, reſolved—to work at his own buſineſs, and relinquiſh the ſtage for ever, ſaying, with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Wolſey,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Farewel, a long farewel to human greatneſs;</hi> onwards he went, leaving his lady, London, his creditors, and choice ſpirits, making the beſt of his way to his own pariſh in Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire,

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0187700100:29"/>Juſt as the epiſtle above-mentioned came to hand, it happened that Miſs Shred was upon a viſit to Miſs Juſtice, or Mrs. Samly, as ſhe was called in the neighbourhood. This young lady, the viſitor, had a very great taſte for plays her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was an occaſional actreſs at Richmond, and at Bartholomew Fair; her father has been breeches ſeater to me theſe nine years, and it was from his mouth, that I have been aſſured of the authenticity of this relation.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Miſs Juſtice had heard the letter read, ſhe ſhrieked, ſhe ſtamped, ſhe wrung her hands, ſhe took ſalts: not Ariadne for the loſs of Theſeus; not a quean condemned to the ducking-ſtool; not—but no alluſions could carricature her. Her lamentations brought up the landlord Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd, to whom Miſs Shred diſcovered Samly's perfidy, although ſhe did not ſhow him the letter, but begged Mr. David would leave the lady a little until ſhe came to herſelf. As it is good manners to do ſo, we will attend the chair—carrying gentleman down ſtairs, who rejoiced exceedingly at the two pieces of good news, as he called them.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, to find Mr. Samly was not her huſband; and in the next place, to ſuppoſe Mr. Samly was run away from her; for David long had loved, long had he ſecretly admired her.</p>
                  <p>The tender God of ſoft deſires rouſed all the ſentimental ſoul of Llwhyddwhuydd, ſoftning his heart, as vinegar will render marble ſupple.</p>
                  <p>'Twas on the 4th day after Mr. Samly and his Chloe had taken the lodgings, that Miſs Juſtice fryed ſome beef ſtakes and onions for Mr. Samly's dinner, and invited their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to the feaſt; ſo reliſhing was the ſauce,

Daſh not the book down, oh ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, becauſe I have related unembelliſhed the beginning of love. — Love has many begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but one ending. Love is like the city of London in a map of England, and the ſenſes are the turnpike roads on which travellers trot to it. Love is like the tunes in the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars Opera, nay, its like the Beggars Opera itſelf; becauſe the cataſtrophe is often brought about very unexpectedly.</p>
                  <p>Men have odd taſtes; why then ſhould David be blamed for this? Is it not common for ladies to relate the ſurpriſing conqueſts they have made over their huſbands, and the ſimple means by which thoſe victories have been obtained. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Blanch avowed to me, her ſpouſe fell in love with her for her ſmall ear. The deputy's wife ſhot her good man with a pair of black ſattin ſhoes, and ſtone buckles; the motion of the hips in walking has made many lady's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Eſquire Pointer declared but laſt week, he was particularly ſtruck with the white point of his wife's elbow: and with all-becoming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for the marriage ſtate do I ſpeak this, as I am myſelf in that nuptial band, I was won to ſurrender my liberty to the all excellent graces
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0187700100:32"/>of my wife, who, in her virgin ſtate, alarmed my eager deſires, when ſhe threw herſelf into that moſt graceful attitude of tying her garter. Here I muſt beg leave to be indulged with ſome anecdotes concerning my ſpouſe.</p>
                  <p>She was born, ſhe was bred a gentlewoman, I married her out of Sir Trinket Trolly's family; her mamma was companion to lady Trolly, and my wife, born in that houſe, was educated in all the becoming elegance, inherent to a woman of the firſt quality.</p>
                  <p>While I paid my addreſſes to her, ſeveral wealthy tradeſmen proffered her their ſervices; but her ſoul was above mixing with vulgarities. She ſcorned to liſten to the voice of mechanic money-loving-ſlaves, ſhe valued the addreſſes of a man of wit, more than all Peru.</p>

                              <p>In London, madam, there are men, as well as women, on the town, and they go by the names of Wits, and Droles, and Clever-fellows, and Choice Spirits; whether they give theſe titles to themſelves, or other people call them ſo, its no matter, but they are ſent for into company to divert people of faſhion, with what they can do, juſt as girls are, I mean, madam, in the way of ſinging and ſaying comic things, and telling ſtories.</p>
                              <p>It is a ſhame though, men ſhould expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, becauſe they are all of them bred to trades, and might get their livings honeſtly and decently, if they were not a ſet of lazy, mean-ſpirited, and conceited fellows.</p>
                              <p>Now when any of our ſex is blaſted, it is all up with us, we are unhappy enough to be reduced to the neceſſity of going into company, or ſtarving; no body will employ us in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt way; becauſe a girl who is forced to be a whore for her livelihood, is looked upon (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0187700100:35"/>by all good chriſtians) to be the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible creature upon the face of the earth.</p>
                              <p>I ſent a card to one of theſe wits and geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſes to ſup with me; the conſequence of which you may naturally ſuppoſe — we went to bed together. — Really I loved him infinitely, for he was not only vaſtly clever, but immenſely odd, and that, you know, takes with our ſex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately.</p>
                              <p>But he ſoon behaved as all ſuch ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will, horridly ingrateful. For after I had paid all his debts (they were not large, indeed, becauſe no ſhops would give him much credit) new cloathed him, and put money in his pocket, he uſed me—as ſurlily, as if I had been his wife; had I really been married to him, he cou'd not have treated me worſe.</p>
                              <p>The word fool, fool; was perpetually his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, not only to me, but to all his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we were all fools, he ſwore, and yet in the whole fifteen months of our cohabitation, tho' he called every body bockheads, yet he never did one rational, or juſt thing: but by chance; he could repartee drolely, tell very high ſtories, argue charmingly upon all ſubjects, make ſongs as faſt as I could cut out cap-patterns; but his words and his deeds were no more alike, than the ſign of a dolphin, and a real one.</p>
                              <p>He once wrote a book in praiſe of neatneſs in dreſs, of elegace, and of decency, he was three weeks about it, and in all that time, never waſhed his hands, face or teeth once. — Cleanlineſs, or dirt, was all the ſame to him, money or no money — only let him but get into company, 'was all he cared for, when he had no money, he was toſſed into the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0187700100:36"/>when he got three or four guineas, he threw it away; and he would ſooner ſit without ſhifting himſelf for a fortnight, in a night cellar, if he had no body left that he could make laugh but link boys, than be regular to the bounds of decency and domeſtic enjoyments.</p>
                              <p>He grew ſo overbearing at laſt, ſo irregular and ſo obſtinate, that I could not bear it — he ſcorned to be talked to, and too proud to ſay he had ever been in the wrong — he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as all wits are, irreſolute and froward as a baby, giddy as a drunken man, abſent as a lunatic, as difficult to be pleaſed as a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ideot, and conceited as an Opera Singer.</p>
                              <p>Oh, my dear, never have any thing to do with your geniuſes, unleſs you can get one of them now and then to write a ſong upon you, for that very often helps a lady to many a good friend—but for all that, I never would have any connection with ſuch ſort of ſparks—as to granting a man that made a good ſong upon me a favour, <hi>ang paſſawnt,</hi> as the French ſay, I ſhould not mind it—but don't never, dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be fond of them—no—the only men worth a lady's notice, are thoſe gentlemen, who have no wit indeed, but then they have what is better than all the wit, genius and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world—and what moſt commonly wit, genius and underſtanding never have any thing to do with; and that is, MONEY—<hi>Money,</hi> my dear. Let but a lady have that—and ſhe is ſure of having, doing, ſaying, and being, juſt what ſhe pleaſes.</p>
                              <p>The next perſon to whom I was predeſtinated, happened to be neither a wit nor a ſcholar, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he was both a genius and a gentleman, becauſe he was a gameſter. As daring as a lyon,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0187700100:37"/>he would as ſoon draw his ſword as his ſnuff-box, and was as quick as volatile ſalts.</p>
                              <p>He valued his honour before any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, in the way of playing any game at cards or dice; for he would ſooner venture his life than be found out, ſo careful was he of his honour. You can't imagine how polite he was, and what fine company he kept, although, as I told you, he could hardly write his name, or ſpell a word of two ſyllables; but a gentleman's being ignorant of letters, is no proof againſt his politeneſs; for really, I believe, it would go very hard with ſome folks of the beſt company, if they were to be examined concerning their reading and writing.</p>

                     <p>Well, madam, my friend did ſuch things in the money-winning way, and with ſuch grace!—to be ſure he lived like a nobleman, and mantained me like a dutcheſs; I had my equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page all upon gilded ſprings, and I uſed to ſcorn all low bred perſons, as I called them, for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a foot; becauſe, as my friend uſed to tell me, nobody never need be poor, if they had but a ſpirit to do things — for if people wanted luck, they ſhould make it, or elſe be puniſhed with poverty for their faintheartedneſs.—But
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0187700100:38"/>for all that, what by the law, or by one thing or another, we dwindled, to be obliged to live in a two pair of ſtairs back-room, madam, as you may do now; and I can't but ſay, we uſed to ſit and think ourſelves very ill done by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—becauſe, why ſhould we be poor? when we took as much pains in the proper way of getting fortunes, as ever any people did who got eſtates, as the faſhion is now to get them. Well, madam, at laſt we parted, and he married a methodiſt's widow, with 500 l. a year join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and I engaged myſelf as a figure dancer at the Opera Houſe, becauſe I was told, a lady had a better chance there of being taken into keeping, than at the Engliſh Play-houſes. But I did not find the Opera people's taſte ſo eager at intriguing with any of our ſex, as I expected.—O, curſe that Italy, my dear—but no more of that—I grew very low, and I ſent to my late friend, who had married the methodiſt's widow for a guinea; and his anſwer was, truly he had done with all the vanities of this life, and ſo ſhould I; and that he would adviſe me not to look after money, but go and ſeek the Lord.</p>

                  <head>SCENE MATRIMONY.</head>
                  <p>ON the wedding-night, after the raptures of enjoyment between Mr. and Madam Llwhyddwhudd were evaporated; when every heart-felt thrill and throb of deſire ſubſided; each fine ſtring of delight, which had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatic ſtretched by imagination's apparatus, let down into a philoſophic relaxation, the new married pair lay back to back. — The lady being moſt reſtleſs, was conſidering, whether it would, or would not, offend the rules of delicacy, if ſhe was once again to turn to her huſband.</p>
                  <p>Her ſpouſe was then debating, ſince he had married ſo good a cook, and ſo notable a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, about making his houſe a public one; which he did the winter following, and had great buſineſs, among the beſt people in the neighbourhood; his ſpouſe being ſo obliging a landlady, occaſioned the famous TRIPE AND TROTTER CLUB, to be inſtituted at Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd's.</p>
                  <p>THE TRIPE AND TROTTER CLUB, was the original of all the other Clubs now exiſting in this metropolis. — From thence came the famous Beef-ſtake Clubs, the Whiſt Clubs, the Ox-cheek Clubs, the Jockey Clubs, the Hornpipe Clubs, the Pea-ſoup Clubs, the Choice Spirit Clubs, the Spirituous Liquor Clubs, the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Clubs, the Philoſophical Clubs, the Roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clubs, the Punning Clubs, the Spouting Clubs, the Kept Miſſes Clubs, and the Club of Diſcontents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0187700100:44"/>David, as he began to get money, grew aſthmatical and pot-bellied; not breathing ſo freely as he was won't to do, it frighten'd him; like the reſt of the wealth accumulating part of mankind, he was terrified at the thoughts of dying, therefore ſent for a phyſician immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                  <p>Reader, you muſt have known ſuch perſons, who, while they worked for their living, were uſeful members to ſociety; but when, by chance or craft, they become maſters of money, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a haughtineſs of behaviour, abandoning themſelves to a vitiated ſtate of idleneſs, and gluttony. The event is, their being ſeized with a complication of infirmities, which, in their active and praiſe-worthy ſtate, they felt not; they hurry to a doctor, give five guineas for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in hopes to have a worthleſs carcaſe ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the worms; which, was it to continue on the earth for twenty years longer, would not be of five ſhillings uſe to any of its fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>David, by his phyſician's order, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his former trade; this he had entirely left off; his ſoul, as he ſaid, being always ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above ſuch an employment; but when health is concerned, when a life is to be ſaved by it— although a lady or gentleman may have ever ſo good a ſpirit, to be ſure, upon ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they muſt give way; according to Sir John Falſtaff's aphoriſm,</p>
                  <q>Honour muſt be hid in neceſſity.</q>
                  <p>While Mr. David was putting himſelf once more into chair-carrying exerciſe, ſome ſoldiers were ordered to be quartered in his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0187700100:45"/>and Corporal Knott brought a billet for himſelf, to Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's</p>
                  <p>The Corporal was a gentleman remarkable for his gallantry; he had had as many fine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as any general officer; he was form'd for intrigue, and graced with every accompliſhment which could undo the fair.</p>
                  <p>He ſung all the ſongs in the Beggars Opera, he could ſpeak ten Tragedy love ſpeeches, could dance a hornpipe, ſhew tricks with cards, balance a lady's fan upon his noſe, no gentleman could fill a tea-pot more gracefully, or ſwear more often, or more agreeably: then he wore his hat ſo ſmartly bluff, and his hair was powdered ſo ſmooth, could he have been but as conſtant as he was lovely. Yet as no man is perfect, he affected to imitate his betters, and boaſt of his amours.</p>
                  <p>It is natural for one hero to take another for his pattern; he choſe Alexander the Great for his; it was the Macedonians frailty to glory too much in his conqueſts; which Arrian could no more excuſe in the ſon of Philip, than I can in Corporal Knott.</p>
                  <p>He, though admired by the fair, was diſliked by his brother ſubalterns, eſpecially the veterans, who, hagged by winter campaigns, their faces weather-worn, and ſcarified; did not like to ſee him look ſo plump, ſo pert, ſo ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and wear his linnen ſo well ironed; when they, who had endured all the inclemency of every hard ſeaſon, in the tented and untented fields of unhoſpitable Germany; who reflected, that, at the time they were thus fighting their country's battles, inſtead of wearing nice plaited linnen, had not any linnen to plait; and half a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0187700100:46"/>dozen brave Britiſh battallion boys, who ſcorned to turn their backs upon double the number of French fellows, though all beruffled and chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlin'd, yet all <hi>their</hi> linnen, would not ſet up a tinder merchant.</p>
                  <p>They ſnarled at this beau Corporal; ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was not fit for any ſervice, but juſt to make one in an officer's guard, at the Opera-houſe.</p>
                  <p>Often have I heard theſe non-commiſſioned heroes, as they have limped along—that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their gait proceeding, either from the wounds received in battle; or from the neglect of not being dreſſed after the fight; or from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable contractions, or relaxations, the fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of being expoſed to the ſcorching heats, and ſudden damps of Africa, and America; and to the ſeverity of wintering in ill-provided quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, on the banks of the Rhine, the Weeſer, the Lippe, &amp;c. &amp;c. for which, perhaps, Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and Dutch commiſſaries, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I was preſent at the diſputation, which old <hi>Winterneſs</hi> had with Corporal <hi>Knott</hi> on this ſubject; which, with the reader's leave, we'll inſert — becauſe, if it is not a ſtory, it is a dialogue; and as it is a dialogue, it will be a means of diſplaying a copper-plate exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of an old warrior, and a junior fine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; or, more properly, to explain the print; it is a contraſt between the <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> in Mr. Knott's figure, and the <hi>Fortune</hi> of <hi>War</hi> in the old ſoldier's portrait.</p>
                  <p>At the valiant tooper the altercation happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; old Winterneſs was relating in the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0187700100:47"/>company all the engagements he had been in; fighting all his battles o'er and o'er again, and marking with a ſtick, upon the ſand of the ale-houſe kitchen, the marches and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches of our armies, dwelling with emphaſis on the ſpot where he had received a ſhot, or loſt a limb.—There, my boys, juſt there, where I put my foot now, there I ſtood on the left of the Scotch greys, and had theſe two cuts on my ſkull, and, as it mought be here, I had theſe three wounds; and ſuppoſing now theſe pieces of pipe to be our front line, as I was to the right of the royal, a muſquet ball took me in flank, and went through both my thighs, and there Sir, as I was running after the French Pollavouſees, I loſt the uſe of my right eye; and, Sir, ſuppoſing this full-pot now to be Bocachica caſtle, there I ſtood while we were attacking it; and here it was, that I left my arm and leg at Cartagenah. — But what then — I don't think much at it, not I —I have gained honour and glory enough for an honeſt man—I know what it is to ſerve my country — and ſo here's his Majeſty King George's health, and all his family, and Old England for ever—and as to my limbs, why they're welcome to um, as welcome as I am to this tobacco of my own buying.</p>
                  <p>This limb-loſing converſation was foreign to the Corporal's thoughts; he had been bred up in polite and delicate principles, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically oppoſite to ſuch gothic cuſtoms; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſeveral people of birth lately, have been mad enough to relapſe into their forefathers ruſticity, and not mind the ſun's ſpoiling their complexions, nor different climates having any

                  <p>Yet he was ready, with a ſmall ſword, to give any private gentleman ſatisfaction—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was fighting upon honour, which no perſon of honour could refuſe—but fighting for one's country may be refuſed; becauſe you may have—or—or—or—or—or—&amp;c. &amp;c. Knott, unwilling that <hi>Old Chelſea</hi> ſhould win all the applauſe of the company, interrupted the ſcar-furrowed gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadier; obſerving, that a man might run as many riſques, be in as many dangers at home, as abroad; and to prove it, related his intrigues with ſeveral fine women.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he recounted the hair breadth ſcapes to get <hi>Miſs Neatsfoot,</hi> the tripe-man's daughter off —how he ſcaled the back garret, how he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the watchman, and how the town was obliged to him for bringing ſo accompliſhed a girl upon it—thus the Corporal went on. — It was I that gave that girl the firſt idea of acting. <hi>I uſt to tell her,</hi> how the firſt time ſhe got into grand keeping, ſhe muſt perſuade her friend to ſpeak to ſome of the managers, about letting her come upon the Stage; becauſe I know that's common — ay, and it's grown a ſcheme too among ſeveral gentlemen about town, to get
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0187700100:50"/>rid of their women that way; for when a girl grows ſtale upon their hands, and they want to part with her genteely, without being a ſettlement out of pocket by her; why then theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will call on one or other of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers, and ſo, in a ſort of half-aſking favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they will tell the proprietor, that there is a fine woman of their acquaintance, who they know will be of ſervice in the Play-houſe; and taking the patentee by the hand, the'll ſay— come ſet the girl down in the liſt, pon honner I ſhall take it immenſely kind, I know you won't refuſe me, what's forty or fifty ſhillings a week out of your pocket; beſides, I am ſure ſhe'll earn it. And this is the way that we have women of the town belonging to the Theatres.</p>
                  <p>Then, continued the Corporal, there was <hi>Bett Filbert,</hi> ſhe was the beſt dreſt fruit girl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout St. James's market—I beat the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raſcals for her — no woman of quality, though ſhe had ever ſo fine a ſilk ſtocking, and diamond ſhoe-buckle on, could ſhow a neater leg and foot then Bett's was, with her ſilver claſps, red clocks, and pinned up petticoats; and as to an elegant and polite manner of doing things; who ever opened oyſters with more affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility then Bett? or made a hot-pot with more taſte then ſhe did?</p>
                  <p>Then there was <hi>Waſte Butt,</hi> the publican's widow, I ſpent about five and forty pounds of her money, only ſhe grew too fond; and when once a woman begins to behave ſo its fulſome, and what no man of true delicacy can bear; I was obliged, therefore, to leave her, and got <hi>cherry-cheeked Judy,</hi> that uſed to liſp at Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-gate, <hi>can o'milk, Sir?</hi>—I was private then,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0187700100:51"/>my officer made me a corporal for her — I a'nt the firſt gentleman, I ſuppoſe, who has made his fortune by women, nor come to preferment, by giving up his miſtreſs.</p>

                  <p>This diſpute would certainly have grown ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, had not the Editor of this work ſtarted up between them—whiſpered Knott, that he ſaw a fine girl paſs by the ſaſh window, and give the Corporal a beckon; away ſkipped Knott, and I begg'd old Winterneſs to be pacified; and that I would bring him half a pound of the beſt pigtail next ſunday.</p>
                  <p>This pleaſed the veteran, he ſhook the Editor heartily by the hand, promiſed him never to mind any more fools for the future; ſwore, when he dyed he would leave me all his papers, if I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0187700100:52"/>would promiſe him to write the hiſtory of an old ſoldier.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary we ſhould return to the other perſonages of our dramatical copper-plate hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and conſider to what purpoſe Corporal Knott was introduced into this narration; with regret I record it, but Madam Llwhyddwhuydd, for all her reſolutions, fell in love with him.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a lady's vows, like French treaties, are not to be relied on—they are like haſty made acts of parliament, which the cunning of conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>niency can always find means to evade. —Beſides, when love is in the caſe; nay, when money, for love and money are like a principle in mechanics, which acts equal and contrary. Love is equal in its power of action to money, but contrary in its effects; for as money will make perſons blind to every thing, but their own intereſt; love will make perſons ſee every thing, but their own intereſt. And with this mechanical, metaphyſical, tritical, critical, and analytical diſquiſition, proper it is to finiſh this ſcene of the drama.</p>

                  <p>There is ſomewhat vaſtly ſignificant, not only in the reputation of being a ſoldier, but alſo in a ſoldier's reputation; which made Madam Llwhyddwhuydd, as ſoon as ever the Corporal came with his billet to her houſe, regard him with an eye of complacency.</p>
                  <p>But when ſhe heard what a number of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he had ruined, ſhe could not take her eyes from him, not being able to imagine what he poſſeſſed ſo extraordinary, that made ſo many

                  <p>The Corporal conceived a moſt violent incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for her, from the moment he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her huſband was a monied man, and that ſhe bore the purſe.</p>
                  <p>He immediately opened his trenches with a love ſpeech, made regular approaches, by ſqueezing her hand; planted his battery of ogles againſt her; and quickly found he had a friend in the garriſon, which determined him to make one general aſſault, by a billet doux, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſhould be in the moſt elegant manner; and concluded to have a ſong wrote upon her.</p>
                  <p>He enquired among the Choice Spirits, who then held their meetings, like the primitive chriſtians, by ſtealth, the reforming conſtables carrying on terrible proſecutions againſt them; he found them at the cat and bagpipe, in Roſemary-lane, after declaring, upon honour, he was no informer; and owning his buſineſs; he was inducted to the preſident, whom you ſee in the print, one George Alexander Stevens, and who was recommended to the Corporal as a ſong-writer.</p>
                  <p>Stevens received ſix-pence from him as earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; for it was a rule, which the poets of that club had made, to always have half the money down; and the preſident declared he would write the ſong, as ſoon as ever the diſputation was over, which the gentleman's entrance had put a ſtop to.</p>
                  <p>The argument was warmly ſupported by the two altercators, Stevens and Harry Howard the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0187700100:55"/>aſs-man, concerning eſſential qualities. George inſiſted, the only acquiſitions, which could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute human happineſs, were temperance, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and propriety of behaviour.—Harry, on the contrary, ſwore, that there were no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments worth a man's while to be maſter of, except good breeding, and a good educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This diſpute would have laſted much longer, had not a headborough opened the door, and producing a warrant againſt Harry Howard for ſcurrility, took away one ſide of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>A ſheriff's officer would have carried off the other, he came there with a thief-take's dog fearful of a reſcue—but leaſt the thread of our hiſtory ſhould be ſnapped too ſoon, we ſhall turn over this cauſe and arreſt, to the chapter entitled the art of bail-taking, or—the—by—London—and Weſtminſter.</p>
                  <p>All gentlemen performers in the pen and ink way of ſong-making, muſt acknowledge it is extremely unlucky, when the lady's name, whoſe perſon they are to celebrate, won't make a proper rhime.</p>

                  <p>The Editor of this undertaking cannot be ſo ingrateful, as to ſuffer ſuch a noble action of the Corporal's to ſlip, without taking proper notice of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the</hi> moſt Noble, moſt Worthy, moſt — <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye great men of many manors, who at this preſent writing can chuſe your taverns, and pay a ready money reckoning for every dainty you call for; while I, twirling my mutton before an ill-ſupplied fire, am ſtretching the elaſticity of my invention, to its utmoſt pitch, how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, upon credit, one ſingle beer and beer libati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—Oh, would ye but imitate this generous ſoldier's behaviour, and beſtow upon the artiſts, you employ, a premium for their merit. But artiſts, perhaps, would think themſelves happy,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0187700100:57"/>could they, inſtead of being paid overplus, only receive the prices they agreed for.</p>
                  <p>But laments are vain, the labourers of genius, and the lollers in a coach and ſix, are no more analogous, than politics and plain-dealing.</p>
                  <p>Honeſtly and <hi>bona ſide</hi> I ſpeak; if they do call me names, I can't help it; but ⅝ of all the rich people in England, were it not for their money, would have no more ſenſe, no more wit, no more taſte, no more generoſity, no more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, no more learning, no more affability, nor more of any more, mores, than we have, who are obliged to mind our books, to make the pot boil.</p>
                  <p>Yet writers, who pretend to ſatyriſe rich folks, are to blame; nor ſhould any pen and ink dealers call the expectants and dependants of wealthy men, who are known by the name of toad-eaters, to an account for their behaviour.</p>
                  <p>To be ſure, the members of the toad-eating club will give his honour vaſt applauſe, if his honour ſays but any thing bordering upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe; and they will alſo lift up their hands and eyes, with theatrical aſtoniſhment, if her ladyſhip ſhould make an obſervation pertinent to the ſubject, and extol the vaſtneſs of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's capacities. Now I cannot ſee any flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in all this; for it is wonderful, conſidering rich peoples education. The ductility of their tutors, the venality of their menials, and the libertiniſms they are indulged in; how they can ever ſay, think, or do any thing, to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Heirs to great fortunes are born as well mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, very often, as the pooreſt tenant's child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; but the underſtanding of the eldeſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0187700100:58"/>hope of great families, is either totally neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe cultivated in an improper manner.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why men of genius are ſo ſeldom rewarded by men of fortune, is, becauſe men of fortune don't underſtand genius; therefore rich people are more proper objects for pity than ſatire. It is the want of having their minds juſtly improved by arts and ſciences, which makes them ſuch ſtrangers, to the happineſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do with their time.</p>
                  <p>To be a man of faſhion, they think, is the excellence of perfection; or they would not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſuch vaſt ſums for the encouragement of grooms, gamblers, proſtitutes and rare-ſhows; when ſo many works of public utility become abortive, and ſo many artiſts pine away for want of the hand of bounty, to bring them to life, for the ſervice of their country.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a ſhame, that in ſo noble a nation as England, renowned throughout the world for arts and arms, the major part of thoſe, who ſhould ſet a better example, only exhauſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their fortunes, in an eternal round of viſits, cards, auctions, foreign fidlers, and ballad-ſingers.</p>
                  <p>As to ballad-ſingers and ballad-makers, the difference is trifling in regard of their merit; but the reward is not proportionable. This Stevens, to my knowledge, has wrote upwards of 200 ſongs, yet never was ſo well paid for any; nay, for all the reſt, as for that one he made the Corporal.</p>

                  <head>SCENE, <hi>the</hi> OVERTHROW.</head>
                  <p>Home haſted the Corporal with the copy of verſes, and gave them the lady wrapped up, as he received them from the author. She hurried into her own room with the pacquet, imagining it was ſome very pretty preſent; but when it was unwafered, and it appeared to be only a paper filled with written hand, which ſhe could not read one ſyllable, Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd ſuffered the moſt cruel agitation of ſpirits, that ever any lady was thrown into; who, by the ſudden whim of ſpouſe or papa, was prevented from being punctual to the moment of aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>She ſuppoſed the letter to be an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Corporal gone to the rendevouz, and had left her that, as a direction where to follow him. How did ſhe then lament her not being book-learned; ſhe fretted, ſighed, ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0187700100:67"/>called on her ſtars, on the Corporal, and fate.</p>
                  <p>The maid, paſſing by the door, heard the outcry, run down to Mr. Knott, beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into the back kitchen, aſked him what he had done to her miſtreſs; for that, as how her miſtreſs was in the moſt wonderful conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, about the Corporal, and what he had wrote in a paper.</p>
                  <p>Knott, who had been, Bajazet like, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though but in fancy, his ſcheme, and what an opinion his landlady muſt have of him, and how fine a fellow ſhe muſt think him; to be able to write ſo fine a ſong, was ſtruck as flat, with what the girl ſaid to him, as a new actor juſt hiſſed.</p>
                  <p>It occured to him, on the inſtant that the verſe-maker had hummed him; and, inſtead of the ſong he had paid for, had palmed ſome other paper, on purpoſe to make the lover look like a fool; and Knott muttered, <hi>damm theſe wits, they are always full of miſchief, eſpecially againſt their beſt friends; however, I'll break the raſcal's bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unluckily for ſome parties, George, the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad-compiler, then was paſſing along on the other ſide of the way, the military man had a view of him, and through the entry Knott burſt into the ſtreet after the ſcribbler.</p>
                  <p>Paſſion or anger will as effectually dazzle perſons eyes as intereſt. Mr. Knott, by rage, was ſo dim-ſighted, that, as he ſprung from the threſhold, he ſaw not a ſedan, which David and his partner were bearing by with a fair in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0187700100:68"/>Againſt its ſide ruſhed the Corporal, and down came the chair, ſhattering upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The glaſſes were ſmaſhed, the ſaſh frames ſhivered; and the ſoldier tumbling over the top of it, rowled into the channel, calling out, as he lay, <hi>oh, Stevens, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll do for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>George Alexander, hearing a threatning voice, imagining it to be a bailiff's, ſtarted off, faſt as fear could wing his feet; and (like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious fine porter, running to his duty) overſet every one who ſtood in his way.</p>
                  <p>The firſt perſon, who fell a victim to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the poet's fears, was <hi>Well-fleet Betty,</hi> ſtanding on the upper ſtep of a cook's cellar, with a baſket full of goods upon her head; one hand was reſted upon her hip, her elbow form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point of an angle, and with the fingers and thumb of the other hand, ſhe was ſnapping defiance.</p>
                  <p>The bard took her in flank, ruſhing againſt her outſtanding elbow; the ſudden ſhock turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her half round, and backwards ſhe pitched into the cellar, juſt as Theo. Cibber's property<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was bringing up twelve-pennyworth of ſoup and ox-cheek <hi>bouilli,</hi> for his maſter come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian's dinner.</p>
                  <p>Down ſouſed Betſy's head into the diſh, and her feet fell on each ſide of the young man's head, upon his ſhoulders; her weight returned him into the cellar; and the broken baking pan, the ox-cheek, the ſoup, and the oyſters, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the floor.</p>
                  <p>Onward ſcampered George, overturning Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's waiter, who had a box full of jellies in his hands; then the ſong ſcribbler met parrellel to his breaſt a mop-handle, which a wench was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0187700100:69"/>twirling; his force flung it in a diagonal direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion down; but the mop hit in its way the ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtockin'd ſhins of a French dancing-maſter the blow brought <hi>Monſieur Capriole</hi> to the ground, he pitched upon his face, and his noſe was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened againſt the pavement.</p>
                  <p>The perpetrator of this miſchief began to be ſcant of breath; and turning his head, as he ran, to ſee where his purſuers were, he threw down a ſalop ſtall.</p>
                  <p>The vender of that diet drink, had juſt ſerved a diſh to no leſs a chapman, than the little poet DERRICK, <hi>the doer of Dryden's works,</hi> who, not thinking of any thing, was very innocently cooling his ſaſſafras, when the groſs bodied bard, like a collier, running foul of a pleaſure boat, tumbled the ſmall ſized verſifier into the dirt.</p>
                  <p>The bulk of Mr. Derrick's muff, prevented him from being bruiſed; but the blade of his pinch-beck hilted rapier, ſnapped in the ſcabbard, and the ſpray of the ſalop, obliged the little gentleman to keep his bed, until the ſcowerer had repaired the damage his laced coat and waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat had ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>Here the race ended; the author of all theſe ills, tumbling at the ſame time, was ſeized by the woman, to pay for what was broke, ſpoiled and ſpilt.</p>

                  <p>The perſon who happened to be in the chair, when it was overturned, was the very drole SAM. FOOT, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the greateſt mimic genius in England; who, after much ſhrieking and ſtruggling, roſe head and ſhoulders high, betwixt the broken frame of the chair-glaſs; his face all ſcratched, like a freſh blooded ghoſt, aſcending through the tragedy trap; on his countenance pallid fear ſat frightful; his livid lips quivered with terror; he begged help for God's ſake, and religiouſly reiterated his intreaties to the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders.</p>
                  <p>He had not, at this time, exhibited publickly any of his extraordinaries; neither was he as yet determined, to what part of the arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences he ſhould devote himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It was to this adventure, and the advice of Miſs Shred, that the town has had the happineſs of being entertained with his <hi>Vis Oeuvres.</hi>

                  <p>After he was delivered from the chair, and inducted into Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's beſt one pair of ſtairs room. Miſs Shred, who ſaw from her chamber the accident, ran over to David's houſe, fearful, they had not politeneſs enough, to accomodate ſo brilliant dreſſed a perſon, as Mr. Foot.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Shred inſiſted, upon carrying up the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of water, and towel, to the gentleman. Mr. Foot received her with all that complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, peculiar to himſelf; and aſſured her, both

                     <p>Sir, a perſon of your appearance demands the moſt polite reception; and, as I am conſcious, the people of this houſe, are too vulgar to uſe ſuch a perſon, as you are, as you ſhould be; therefore I left my own houſe, that I might pay a proper regard to one of your elegant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>

                     <p>Madam, you do me too much honour; to be ſure ma'am, I conceive the inhabitants of this porter-ſelling territory, to be the quinteſſence of vulgarity. My Ideas never before announc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a contemptible ſet of reptiles, as thoſe creatures were, who helped me out of the chair: one ſhould not, they ſay, mock one's friends; but upon my ſoul, they were ſuch a collection of groteſques, that while they were doing me a great piece of ſervice, I could not help taking them off; and the fellow who ſeemed to have the moſt humanity about him, and was really very tender of me, ſquinted his compaſſion with two ſuch inverted eyes, ſaying—<hi>I hope your honour cant hurt, Sir.</hi>

                     <p>I vow, Sir, that look was vaſtly like him; but I am ſurpriſed, Sir, a gentleman of your accompliſhments, ſhould ſeem to heſitate, about taking off your friends; it is the extreme wit
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0187700100:73"/>of the politeſt perſons; and which, Sir, you muſt know, and if you was not to do it, Sir, it would be a loſs to the world; for you know, Sir, each individual admires to have an acquaintance, nay, all their acquaintance, made ridiculous; and I am perſuaded, no perſon, can be more happy in that execution, than yourſelf.</p>

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> FOOT.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, it is impoſſible for me to expreſs, how high an idea I entertain of a lady, poſſeſſed of ſuch a capability, as I find you miſtreſs of, therefore I can do no leſs, than dedicate myſelf to your ſervice.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>
                        <hi>Miſs</hi> SHRED.</speaker>
                     <p>I accept your homage, dear Foot, and I give you my hand, which acts equal with my heart; and as I know your talents, are as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trordinary, as you are pleaſed to obſerve my capabilities are ſurpriſing, I will plan, and you ſhall execute, as I am conſcious my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are perfectly pictureſque.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>This it was, on which Mr. Foot laid the foundation of that grandeur, we have ſeveral times ſeen him ſo amazingly arrive at. To
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0187700100:75"/>Miſs Shred he was obliged, for the hint of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tea; by her he alſo was initiated into that ſpecies of wit and humour, with which, to this day, he continues, with ſo much originality, to entertain the town.</p>
                  <p>During this above-ſtairs converſation, David was buſied, in picking up his chair's fragments; the Corporal was upon foot purſuing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but the ſoldier met his officer at the turn of a ſtreet, who ordered him immediately to get ready, and ſet out next morning for Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall.</p>
                  <p>Knott, though he was alarmed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, knew his duty was to be ſilent, and obey.—But took his reſolutions accordingly; as he had been hitherto ſucceſsful in his ſchemes, with the fair ſex, and that his time was ſo ſhort, he went upon the hunt, for two of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades he could confide in.</p>
                  <p>This was the reaſon, that Madam Llwhydd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whydd did not ſee her lover all that day; although its certain, no lady ever more longed, that is, ſhe wanted to be ſatisfied, and no perſon, ſhe was ſure, or at leaſt ſhe thought herſelf ſure, and that fancy with many ladies, amounts to a certainty, that no body could ſatisfy her, ſo well, as the Corporal.</p>
                  <p>The damaged chair was ſent to be repaired; Mr. Foot and his lady took coach for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try jaunt. David, having nothing elſe to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf with, reſolved to walk into Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to ſee his brother on board of ſhip.</p>
                  <p>His ſpouſe, who knew her huſband would not be at home, until four or five in the morning, began to be vaſtly uneaſy about the Corporal, who made it evening before he returned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0187700100:76"/>The gueſts withdrawn, the maid hurried to bed; juſt as the feeble watchman, whiſtling in his ſound, came by coughing out, pa-a-aaſt 11 o'clock—Mr. Knott, high in blood, ſtole (like Lothario) unheeded to his dear Llwhydd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whuydd's chamber, he found the lady <hi>looſe, unattir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, warm,</hi>—I aſhamed to ſay it—but <hi>fuddled,</hi> abſolutely <hi>non compos;</hi> how it happened, as well as ſo melancholy an accident can bear relating, ſhall be diſcloſed.</p>
                  <p>That night the lady went up ſtairs, in charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits. Mr. Knott having received the wink of aſſignation, while he ſat below, drinking with his comrades. But alaſs, unhappy gentlewoman, reflecting perhaps too much, on what might very naturally happen, between her, and the Corporal; ſhe grew immoderately thirſty, in poetry we ſhould expreſs it, <hi>ſhe was burning with deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By miſtake ſhe put a bottle of brandy to her mouth, which had, in the hurry, been put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corked where the water-bottle uſed to ſtand. It was there placed by the maid, the miſtreſs's ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den coming up, prevented the girl from any other ways diſpoſing it.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's agitation of mind, rendered her incapable of judging the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, until ſhe had ſwallowed ſo large a gulph; intoxication was the conſequence. By which the reader is deprived of one of thoſe luſcious deſcriptions, which are now looked upon in the novel way, the moſt eſſential embelliſhments for modern bookſelling.</p>
                  <p>Yet not to have our cuſtomers entirely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, we preſent them with the lady aſleep, in one of thoſe engaging attitudes, ſo enticing,

                  <p>Elderly lovers have out-lived their's, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both muſt be alike fed, and their ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs appetites, tempted by inſubſtantial garniſh; not having power to reliſh manly food.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Knott, knowing by the orders he had received from the captain, there was no time to ſpare, took ſome pains to waken the lady; and having recovered her ſo well, as to acknowledge ſhe loved no man like the Corporal, he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her how he was pinched for time; the lady, fearing to loſe her ſo very lately gained lover; the force of liquor, and power of the Corporal's arguments, altogether correſponding, made her conſent that very night to go off with him. The maid faſt aſleep in the garret, the drawer dead drunk in the cellar, and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from home. She packed up all the plate, ready money, and her beſt cloaths; for that is an obſervation I have generally made, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who, by ſtealth, leave their huſbands, are determined that the loſs ſhall be as ſeverely felt, as the time they have to accompliſh their ſcheme will admit.</p>
                  <p>It was by the help of Mr. Knott's comrades, every article was brought ſafe to the Fly; in which the Corporal and his lady were convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without one accident to Portſmouth; there the next morning, by the greateſt good luck, they found a ſloop going off for Plymouth, in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0187700100:79"/>which they embarked, and in four days landed there, then by eaſy journeys reached Cornwal; to which the Corporal's rout was directed.</p>
                  <p>Since we have conducted Mrs. Llwhydd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whuydd ſo far, we'll let her reſt a little after her journey, and take a trip to London, to inquire what became of her huſband.</p>

                  <p>The ſpirit of the liquor ſublimates through the valves, and ducts, from the ſtomach: and the froth, or Aerial parts of diſputes, obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, altercations and witticiſms, make their way, thro' the auricular glands or organs, at the ſame time, into the cellulae of the brain.

                  <p>But when all the pia and dura mater apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are filled, and not a ſingle idea, even for the good of ſelf, can be wedged in, there will remain great quantities of this windy effluvia, which the owner of the head has imbibed in the laſt day and night's exerciſe, which muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, charged, before the proper diſpoſed imaginations can have room to act.</p>

                  <p>After David had ſlept about five hours, loud and ſound, the elaſtic coats of his brain began to exert their pulſations, and he dreamed a dream which forboded miſchief, as plain as any dream, ever repeated at breakfaſt, by the polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, prettieſt, and moſt ſenſible maid, wife, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or miſtreſs, you enjoyed a morning's tête a tête with, or at leaſt, that you ſaid you did.</p>
                  <p>David did dream, as how, that the Tower of London was made of papier machée; and that the French intended to undermine all our coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and ſo deſtroy the nurſery of our ſeamen.</p>
                  <p>Out of the ſeven or eight millions of Great Britain's inhabitants, one million we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſe will read this book; and that 900,000 of thoſe readers, delight in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of dreams; for their emolument, we ſhall explain this dream, viz. The Tower of London, being made of chewed paper, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the affection of his wife, which he thought permanent, as the bulwarks which the mud and graſs of tower ditch ſemicirculates; was as inſubſtantial, as the incoherent orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of waſte paper: and the French, and the coal-pits meant, that a wicked enemy, ſhould undermine the navigation to his wife's heart.</p>
                  <p>At noon, next day, David waked, and with broad eyes found,—but by all rules of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an author, as well as a painter, is to

How Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd looked; where he looked; what he ſaid, when he could ſpeak; and how long it was, before he returned to a capability of ſaying, or ſeeing, or doing any thing.</p>

                              <p>The three eſtates, or different modes of the Soul's conſtitution, are denominated high-life, middle-life, and low-life.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe degrees, when put into a paſſion, act upon the ſame parallel; and as you may have ſeen Mr. Bayes's ſun, moon, and earth, dancing the hay; ſo it is with theſe; highlife ſhall be middle, middle ſhall be low, low high, and they ſometimes dance ſo much, and ſo long, that there is no diſtiction to be obſerved between them.</p>

I wiſh, may it pleaſe your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that you would either look a little more into it, or ſuffer your eldeſt ſon, to be a little better acquainted with it; and I would bett a good name againſt great riches, and that's ten pounds to a crown, you know; that if thoſe perſonages, who can read it, would ſtudy it, not thumb and dog's ear a drole place or two; but go fairly, and honeſtly through it; they would be taught, to think worſe of themſelves, than they do at preſent; and thereby become better for the future.</p>
                  <p>There would every egotiſt diſcover, <q>That his conſequence was but conceit, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment merely opinion. That FLATTERY is the univerſal language.

                     <q>And when the moſt polite are moſt angrily agitated, they may, and do often, ſwear, huff, kick, curſe, ſtrike, abuſe, break, and bellow, with ſuch violence, as if they were no more than a chairman; or any other ſuch illiberal beings. And I beg leave to obſerve, (for all what the heralds office alledge to the contrary) even her grace, although deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately dignified, may be horridly chagrin'd, if

                  <p>The unfortunate Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſwore himſelf out of breath, in hurrying backwards, and forwards, throughout the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, to tell his ſad ſtory. Vowed many raſh vows, and ſaid many bad things. When his friends found his anger, was obliged, for want of freſh ſpirits, to ſubſide; and he was ſufficiently relaxed, to hear conſolation, they adminiſtered advice <hi>gratis.</hi> As all Engliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to do, one among another; the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of my countrymen and women, are apt enough to beſtow their counſels, even unaſked, in all caſes,—none but phyſicians and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers making money of their words.</p>
                  <p>They ſell their advice, as Lapland witches do wind, only to make more miſchief.</p>
                  <p>His partner, begged him to be comforted; ſqueezing Mr. Llwhyddwhydd by the brawny part of his thumb; my dear David, don't hurt yourſelf any more, by grief. I don't doubt, but all will be well as ever; and your ſpouſe ſhall come home again; and there will be no harm done; and you will live hapyy, to the end of your days; and you muſt take example by your betters, and forget, and forgive, as the Bible ſays.</p>
                  <p>This ſpeech, gave David great cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; and after he was in bed that night, thus he ſoliloquiſed.</p>
                  <p>In the name of God, and St. David, can I ever, in honour, have my wife home again? Am I not an ancient Briton? Where then muſt I put my honour? Is not my honour, the ſeat of my heart? and has ſhe not given away her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0187700100:85"/>honour? and would ſhe come home, and take away my honour too? now that damm dog of a ſoger, has laid hold of her honour for himſelf,—more ſhame for him; that any of King George's men ſhould not have honour of their own.</p>
                  <p>Not being able to ſleep, he went to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; and looking over the index of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, among thoſe curious receptacles of the atoms of univerſal learning, he found the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing eſſay, concerning</p>

                                 <p>However, the mahometans have great honeſty, in reſpect of their meum and tuum dealings. But that method of merchandiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is no more than an abſolute ſentiment, which might do well enough for the moral law, but the ſtatutes, and practices of the European courts, being by revealed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more enlightened; ſuch infidels as Turks and heathens, by not having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we chriſtians have, can never act ſo upright as we do.</p>
                                 <p>Laws, honour, equity, and honeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refined, are to be conſidered—but we refer the reader, for a proper explication of thoſe matters, to our notes, upon the Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian creed.</p>
                                 <p>In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are extremely tenacious of their honour; as they are alſo of their religion; the two moſt noble practices of the ſoul.</p>
                                 <p>They are perſons of ſuperior honour, and religion, to the reſt of Chriſtendom; which accounts, why ſo many people are poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aſſaſſinated, and put into the inquiſition, in thoſe countries, more than any others. It is all done, as that very pains-taking Mr. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques obſerves, to GLORIFY GOD, and for their own honour.</p>
                                 <p>The French, are not much bigotted to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial honour; but they have very ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic ideas of glory, and imagine, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0187700100:87"/>glory is preferable to limbs, health, life, and even the profits of a 25 per cent. uſury.</p>
                                 <p>Nay, ſo prone are our Engliſh people, to follow French faſhions, that we have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this mode; and ſuch is the common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of our country, to improve upon every invention, that a great many of our Britons have carried this glory much farther than ever the French dared; they had a very fair trial for it lately; and, in ſpite of pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This was not ſatisfactory to Mr. Llwhydd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whuydd; he did not underſtand any thing about glory; all his care was about his honour, and not meeting with an explanatory account, in any of his volumes, he aroſe next morning, to conſult an old acquaintance, and country woman of his, and one of the wiſeſt people ever born; for ſhe was deſcended in a direct line, from the child, that Queen Sheba had by King Solomon. Though ſhe could not prove herſelf of one of the moſt ancient families; yet, for the greatneſs of her underſtanding, the defect of birth was overlooked; and ſhe was made overſeer of the weeders, to a Welch gardener's at Lambeth.</p>

                                 <p>I ſay unto you, my beloved, that when the ſpirit agitateth the fleſh, it is a ſpiritual act; but when the fleſh motioneth the ſpirit, it is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal one. And this is the difference, between GRACE and DISGRACE.</p>
                                 <p>For worldly things, unleſs ſanctification ſeeths them, are no more than kitchen ſtuff; which the ſcum of our ſins maketh, in boiling over, and that is put into the offal pot of repentance.</p>
                                 <p>Therefore, the ſaints of the Tabernacle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clarified by the juſtification of the new birth, are pure Chriſtian ſuet; which, when mixed with the plumbs of the righteous, make up the pudding of glorification.</p>

                     <p>O ſweet Abraham, what heavenly language is this: don't go to ſleep, David, I deſire of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0187700100:94"/>you; how can you be worſe than a heathen, and not liſten to this ſweet ſoul-ſaving ſpeech.</p>
                     <stage>Reads again,</stage>
                     <p>The pudding of glorification—therefore I ſay, that we may mingle the ſpirit with the fleſh, even as potatoes and butter-milk make ſtirra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; for that is the type of the carnalities, and ſpiritualities.</p>
                     <p>So I ſay <stage>[wiping her ſpectacles,]</stage> it is not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conſider the uprightneſs of the fleſh, as directed by the ſpirit; becauſe we may receive the ſpirit at home, or in the fields, or in an alley, or in a centry-box; and I'll ſtand centry among you; and if you have faith, you ſhall raiſe the dead to life. I won't be a velvet-mouth'd preacher, like your church doctors, and book learned blockheads. —no—no—no—oh—oh,—can a boy fly a kite without thinking of the clouds? can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpread her fan, without thinking of an angel's wings? Therefore, I ſay, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man is not the ſpiritual man. Yet the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man may think of natural things. So thoſe things are to be put forward, which are to ſatisfy the longings of the ſoul; and tho' at firſt it may be painful to undergo them.</p>

                  <p>At that inſtant, the tankard from the hand of Mr. David, fell to the ground; the good man, overcome with the two quarts of porter, the keeping all night awake, reflecting upon his honour, and the potency of the preacher's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, dropped faſt aſleep.

                  <head>SCENE PLYMOUTH.</head>
                  <stage>Madam Llwhyddwhuydd, Corporal Knott, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank Doctor, Duel, Merry Andrew, Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Cards, and News-papers.</stage>
                  <p>THE Corporal, by this time, and his lady, began to view one another in not that rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous point of ſight, as at firſt. All the plate, and ready money, which ſhe had taken with her, was expended; for Mr. Knott, had too much of the fine gentleman in him, not to be fond of play; and too good an opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to fancy any perſon could take him in; but after the money was all gone, his eyes were opened, and he determined to commence gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler himſelf.</p>
                  <p>At his quarters lodged a Mountebank and his man. The Merry Andrew was a maſter of arts in ſporting; he could bend, ſlip, ſhade, ſpur, feather-edge, work a brief, knew ſhorts and longs, the high and low games at put, the three ſhuffles of whiſt, upper and under palm, opening a pack, or rounding dice, with all the ſecures, the bars, loads, ringing of changes, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But he, having then an occaſion for a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe he wanted to take his maſter in for a ſum; and as all ſporting men act beſt by confederacy, the Corporal and Pickle Herring entered into a family compact.</p>
                  <p>Mean while poor Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd daily ſat diſconſolate at home, never ſeeing her gallant,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0187700100:96"/>but when he reel'd to bed, incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having to her like a gentleman.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh, ſome ladies of my acquaintance, with whom it is at this moment a toſs up, between inclination and intereſt, would read this part of my book carefully; and they would know, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, modern memoirs mention whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Zephyrs, eternal conſtancy, love-lane aſſignations, breath-ſtopped kiſſes, midnight moon-ſhine, a charming fellow, and the poſt chaiſe door open,—that according to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted teſtimonials of ſeveral maiden gentle-women, who, by heart-felt experience, vow, a lady is worſe cooped up, who goes off with her gallant, than the moſt domeſtic wife, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes the drudgery of the nurſery, and kitchen.</p>
                  <p>Let us only example Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd. She had no perſon to viſit her, was viſited by no perſon, obliged, from having a houſe of her own, to put up with a mean, ready furniſhed lodging; in which, ſitting all day ſolitary,—for believe me, dear ladie, the fine fellow of your fancy, ſoon grows ſick of his ſweatmeats, and every fond couple, who leave honour, family and ALL for love, having then nothing but love to live upon, ſoon eat up their allowance.</p>
                  <p>Think ladies, what Mr. David's wife ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who, like all other eloping ladies, had truſted the gallant with all, and dreaded to aſk him for a ſingle ſhilling, leſt he ſhould think her extravagant; denying herſelf neceſſaries, becauſe he ſhould not grumble at expence How melancholy her caſe; no companions, but her own thoughts, reflecting and comparing paſt, with preſent times; her former reſpect, her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0187700100:97"/>infamy,—her huſband's tenderneſs, his repeated tenderneſs; her gallant's coldneſs, his continued indifference.</p>
                  <p>It is not, I hope, ſo bad with every lovely lady errantreſs. Yet many of them have experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—don't ſigh, dear creatures;—I know its a melancholy ſcene, and in the cataſtrophe ſtill more vexatious; becauſe the reaſon which ſome ladies alledge, for running away from their guardians or parents, is, the unbearable uſage, which they receive at home, therefore apply to gallants, in hopes of mending their condition, as flying fiſh ſpring out of the ſea to avoid the Dolphin, and tumble into the jaws of the ſhark.</p>
                  <p>Yet as the moſt time-ſerving-ſcribbler ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes himſelf, at the bottom of a dedication, to his right honourable patron; as the tradeſman bows, bill in hand, to his honour, with paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel awe, I addreſs the ladies, and aſſure them, that my opinion of their magnanimity, will not ſuffer me to imagine, any thing here ſaid, can alter what a fine woman has already reſolved upon.—No—ſpite of all advice or example, her ſpirits will carry her through, whatever her will gives the word for, let the conſequence be—no matter what.</p>
                  <p>David's ſpouſe had, for ſome time, been in a moſt uncomfortable ſtate. She felt the ſevere pinches of neceſſity, which are evident ſymptoms of repentance; daily, hourly did ſhe reproach herſelf, how ill ſhe had uſed her dear, dear huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; how ill her gallant had uſed her; not a friend had ſhe to confide in, except the Merry Andrew above-mentioned; to him ſhe now and then diſcloſed her griefs; he proffered her all the aſſiſtance in his power; vowed he had a vaſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0187700100:98"/>regard for her, and ſealed thoſe vows, upon her lips; juſt at the inſtant, the Corporal opened the door.</p>
                  <p>All in rage, Mr. Knott ruſhed on the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, kicked him down ſtairs; b—d his lady, and vowed never again to bed her.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Mr. Knott was glad of an occaſion to break off the acquaintance; for he found it very heavy, ſupporting her out of his pay; and beſide, he had commenced another intrigue, with a lady who kept a raffle, who had agreed to go off with him.</p>
                  <p>The tumbler, all in a rage, for being uſed ſo by the Corporal; went inſtantly to his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and diſcovered, that the night before, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Corporal had cheated the doctor at cards, of fifteen pounds, four ſhillings; and told his maſter, that his conſcience would not let him keep it.</p>
                  <p>No one thing can hurt a lady, or gentleman, or any other two legged exiſtent, if there are any other perſons, in this kingdom, that are not either gentlemen or ladies, except ſome of the Opera Singers.—I ſay, and am ſure, nothing can hurt ſo much, as being made a fool, or a tool, unleſs ſelf-intereſt orders it ſo to be.—then, indeed, as A—B—C—D—E—and—&amp;c. obſerved, it is proper to appear in taſte.</p>
                  <p>But to be a tool, and be out of pocket by it,—Seneca, at the head of his ſtoical regiment of Old Buffs, could not bear it.</p>
                  <p>And as the doctor, like all other doctors, wore a ſword (which, I believe, the faculty at firſt bore emblematically, to denote an aptitude to kill) after a conſultation, with his Merry Andrew,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0187700100:99"/>he determined upon having his money, and ſent Mr. Knott the following letter.</p>

                  <p>The Corporal received this note, as he ſat over a large bowl of punch, with two recruits juſt liſted. He was as brave, as Britiſh ſpirits could make him; and reading the letter, ſwore 'twas very well, he'd come; he would do every thing like a gentleman, and give every body ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—but as to returning, or paying the money back, he was above it.—No, he was too much a man of honour, he ſwore, to be compelled, no, the ſword ſhould decide it.</p>
                  <p>All fluſh, all gallant was Mr. Knott, the drum beating, recruits ſinging, and bumpers going briſkly about.—Yet the contents of the letter, began like oil, to prevent the potency of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0187700100:100"/>the brandy punch, any longer ſublimating into the Corporal's head.</p>
                  <p>Not that he feared the doctor, or even death, the preſident and commander in chief of all doctors; but his honour was doubly concerned; he promiſed to meet a lady, a new lady, that night; and he would not break that appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for twenty doctors; but then, who would dare to ſay, Knott wou'd'nt fight? No body ſhould; he ſwore, and in order to keep his word and honour, with both parties, he laid his plan of operations accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The doctor, who was equally political, <hi>(in what a political age do we now live!)</hi> made this appointment by moon-light, becauſe his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt ſhould not diſcover, that he had a quire of white paper for a breaſt-plate, faſtened neatly under his ſhirt.</p>
                  <p>Each combatant, firmed in his ſafeguard ſcheme, went with the utmoſt intrepidity to the combat. Nobly, magnanimouſly they met. So when—no—come, all ye ſpirits, who have inſpired the belligerant powers, to firm fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and thou, whoever thou art, whether begot by Folly, or Madneſs, or both; thou AETHERNAL, who preſides over duels, ſuitable-ſpirit for ſuch a ſubject, inſpire me, to deſcribe the memorable behaviour, of thoſe truly paired belloniſts, who ſo intrepidly paraded upon the ſuppoſed-to-be-ſanguinary-ſpot; and then, ſo woundleſs,—ſo—ſo—ſo.—<hi>So have I ſeen</hi> — ay, reader, and ſo may you alſo have ſeen, as well as me, a great many things; but among all the ſhews, did you ever obſerve a ſlit deal figure, ſet up, on the top of a malt-houſe tunnel, or, as a ſcare-ſcrow in a garden, holding in each hand
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0187700100:101"/>a wooden ſword; which, by the contrivance of the carpenter, and force of the wind, whirl'd its arms about, above, and below, acroſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, ſlaſhing, ſtriking, flouriſhing, in every prize-fighting direction, ingratefully thraſhing that air, which puts it in motion.</p>
                  <p>Thus is a duelliſt agitated, by honour, which is no more than air; a puff, a wind, a vapour.—Miſtake not the editor's meaning—he is only writing concerning the term honour, which urges, planet ſtruck people, to take the unneceſſary trouble of cutting one another's throats, when, as the madman obſerved, <hi>let but your enemies alone, and they'll dye of themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But duelliſts, like Jobſon at blindman's buff, lay about them, ſlap, daſh, north, eaſt, weſt, ſouth, on every point of the compaſs, becauſe this honour anſwers to all points, all make a point of honour.</p>
                  <p>It was one of honour's points, the money-getting point, which goaded the doctor to this honourable experiment, and which the Editor, would not have been ſo explicit in, had he not taken the trouble of viſiting tennis courts, billiard-rooms, horſe-race meetings, whiſt-clubs, ſkettle-grounds, hazard-tables, and nine hole alleys; and been aſſured from all parties there, that the doctor was right (in point of honour) to demand his money; and the Corporal was right (in point of honour) to refuſe returning it.</p>
                  <p>The place appointed for their meeting, was a very wide, dry trench, high mounded on each ſide, and open at each end, like that part of New Market turf, called the devil's ditch, and where, for the name ſake, all hereafter duels ſhould be decided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0187700100:102"/>They came to the, ſpot, juſt as the clock ſtruck nine, they drew their ſwords, and ſtood in quart and tierce attitudes, between four and five yards aſunder.</p>
                  <p>They flouriſhed their blades, on which the moon ſhine bright beaming, the glare ſtartled the heroes.</p>
                  <p>As veracity is the Editor's principle obſervance, throughout this treatiſe, it is neceſſary, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late how two ſuch men could be brought to the ſcene of action, and draw their ſwords at each other.</p>
                  <p>The doctor was aſſured by his tumbler, that if he did but ſend a challenge, it would bring the Corporal to any terms, and he had nothing to do, but only go to the appointment, draw his ſword, and Knott would return the money.</p>
                  <p>After (by his man's advice) the letter was ſent, the mountebank began to have ſome qualms—he doubted, he was diſmayed, and as Mr. John Weſley, and Mr. John Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's coadjutors, have often declared, <hi>that Satan buffetted them about;</hi> even ſo was the doctor's tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ghts toſſed, here and there, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to make of himſelf, he reſolved to bumper it about until fighting time, to drive off even the idea of death.</p>
                  <p>Not that he way any ſtranger to that ſpectre; having employed him in as many ſhapes, as the doctor had patients; but he wanted not that fiend, to have any concerns with himſelf; therefore he drank to fortify his mind, and wore a ſtationary breaſt-plate, to barricade his noble parts.</p>
                  <p>The Corporal marched to the rendeſvouz, with a certainty of ſucceſs.—Firſt from his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0187700100:103"/>own conſequence, that the quack ſcoundrel dare not fight him; next, let it even come to the worſt, and he ſhould be obliged to draw his ſword,—Mr. Knott had planned ſuch a ſcheme,—and entirely by the ſcale, ſector, and true modern practiſe of duelling, which is, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the vaſt, vaſt honour, of being a fighting man, and duelliſt, without running any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous riſque.</p>
                  <p>The Corporal's plot was, to wait for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, to make the firſt thurſt, then to fall backwards immediately, and bid the doctor make the beſt of his way off, becauſe that he himſelf was a dead man, the doctor having done for him.</p>
                  <p>Both thus ſecure in their ſafe-guards, ſtood firm—but at the diſtance before-mentioned; indeed it is proper, all quarrelling people ſhould ſo keep aſunder; their right arms were extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſword point-paralled to ſword point.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, the doctor being by drink, the moſt elevated, quavered out, ha, ha, and ſtamped his foot at the ſame time; but the unfaithful ſod, ſinking to his tread, brought his body forwards; deſtroyed the centre of gravity, and prone on his face he fell, without ſtretched arm and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>
                  <p>The Corporal obſerved the glittering ſteel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, backwards at that ſignal fell down, and with a great groan cried out—O I am done for—it's through and through me.—Doctor I forgive you—but make the beſt of your way off—for—oh—I am a dead man.</p>
                  <p>Terrified at theſe words, his antagoniſt reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what it was to kill a man, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſecundum artem ſtatute; crawled
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0187700100:104"/>backwards on his hands and knees, crab like, out of the oppoſite end of the ditch. Leaving his ſword (as he ſuppoſed) ſticking in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral's body; as ſoon as he got upon his feet, he ſcamper'd off, ſtrait forwards, not minding which road he took, all he thought of, at that time was, the hue and cry, which he fancied he heard very plainly behind him.</p>
                  <p>The Corporal, riſing by degrees, was ſoon ſatisfied of the ſucceſs of his ſcheme, and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the duplicate ſword, haſtened to his other rendeſvouz, and there he ſhewed his new lady the weapon, which he had brought away with him; telling Madam Raffle, <q>I was obliged to kick that ſcoundrel mountebank, my dear, and make him deliver up his ſword, here it is you ſee, for his inſolence, to pretend to dare to hint any thing againſt your reputation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of every intrigue, fond beauty fancies all is goſpel, which her gallant ſpeaks.—Knott's new miſtreſs replied, <q>That to be ſure, I knowed as how, Mr. Corporal, you was a vaſtly brave man; and we will live and dy, and I'll go through the world with you.</q>—But the cataſtrophe of their loves hereafter.</p>
                  <p>We have now got rid of a pair of lovers, as dextrouſly as any play wright, who after cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly bringing them together, gives the promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a cue—wheu—wheu whiſtles Mr. Pimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limpimp, the word giver, and the brace of woers are interſected from the audience, by the canvas landſcape, or ſize painted ſtreet ſcene; and the reſt of the comedy goes on as uſual.</p>
                  <p>When our laſt expreſs came away, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank was on foot, terribly racing it along,

                     <p>Who is it will diſintereſtedly pilot a genius, to the Cape of Good Hope?—I,—I,—I—I, will,—we all will,—every body will,—and body will take him on board, and be glad to ſail with him; for all the world will be fond of his company; who denys it? but pray, Sir, when the veſſel comes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0187700100:106"/>to port, who will help him out of the ſhip? who will pay the captain for his paſſage?</p>
                     <p>However diverting, during the voyage this drole fellow may have been, and whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes he may receive with invitations to every one's meſs, while on board, as ſoon as anchor is dropped, all is forgot. Every one then is hurrying home about their own buſineſs, adieu Mr. Genius—your ſervant, Mr. Genius—here Tom put theſe things behind the poſt-chaiſe; we are obliged to you for your good company, Mr. Genius, ſorry can't ſtay with you any longer—go on boy—a very divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature that man was, my lord—yes, anſwers the man of title; theſe wits and droles are very well for a gentleman to be entertained with, now and then at taverns, or on ſhipboard; but they ſhould not be taken any notice of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly—for they are always poor—know nothing of the world, and are rather imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>

                     <p>This will be illuſtrated in the continuance of the quack's hiſtory, who we left upon foot, nor have we yet brought him to a ſtand-ſtill. Fright made him miſs his way, it was midnight before he reached the gates of his inn; they were barred, and every candle out in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſed to think all was ſo quiet, he reſolved to creep up the back way into the yard, get his money and cloaths out of his room, before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ſecrete himſelf among the miners.</p>
                     <p>Up a broken butterice, belonging to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he ſcrambled, and got aſtride the wall; juſt as Tom the tapſter opened the garden-door, in his breeches, ſhirt and ſlippers.</p>
                     <p>The moon brightly ſhining at the mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank's back, made a long black ſhadow upon the graſs-plat; which, moving before the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's eyes, ſtopped him from ſtepping forward; his knees knocked together, his teeth chattered, his feet he drew ſoftly out of the ſlippers, and and ſidling barefooted, he ſlunk into a dark ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at his left hand.</p>
                     <p>The medicine-monger was not a whit leſs terrified, at ſeeing a human figure in white; for the moon gave him full view of the tapſter. A croſs the wall he ſat aghaſt; he thrice attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay ſome prayers, but had none to ſay. He muttered the only religious ſentiment, which he knew, viz. grace after meat; ſaying, Lord make me thankful for what I have received—this over and over he repeated, holding himſelf on the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0187700100:108"/>wall by the help of his hands, as a ſailor fixes his fiſts upon the ſaddle pommel.</p>
                     <p>The doctor was confident he ſaw the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's ghoſt; almoſt petrified with apprehenſion, he ſat there, and there would have ſat until morning, had not the ſtronger fear, leaſt the ghoſt ſhould be creeping along the ſide of the wall, to ſeize him, forced him from his place; and heaving himſelf up by his hands, he ſtrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling, throwed himſelf along the wall, on the ridge of the bricks, with his eyes all the time fixed on that ſpot, from whence the ghoſt had vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>He reached the top of an old cow-houſe, and rolling himſelf upon it, his weight broke the boards, and betwixt two rafters he ſell, jammed midway; his weight forced him down, his bulk prevented his whole body to fall through; there he was wedged faſt by the waiſtband, and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hell held him, he ſhrieked, roared, kicked, flung his arms about, and tumbled the looſened rotten planks over and over.</p>
                     <p>The poor drawer, hearing the dreadful out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, ecchoed his ſhrieks, with ſhrieks more ſhrill, and run up the yard, calling out help, murder, fire, help, help.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe wakened every one in the inn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the landlord. Each ſtarted up terrified at the exclamation, confuſion, and affright ſeized them; from firſt, ſecond floors, and garrets; from down, feather, and flocks, all came, hurry ſcurry, like mob from the twelve-penny gallery.—Back to her own bed, Betty the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid ſlipped, to put ſome things on, leaving her gallant, a London rider, ſhaking in a fear-raiſed argue fit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0187700100:109"/>The hoſteſs ſcudded from the ſerjeant of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, her eldeſt daughter, ſlipped out of the commanding officer's apartment, her youngeſt, down barefooted was brought trembling, upon the boot-catcher's back. All the reſt of the good company half dreſſed, aſſembled round the tapſter, who told them, there was a ſpirit playing the devil in the old cow-houſe.</p>
                     <p>By the tempting promiſe of two guineas, the three oſtlers and a ſtage-coachman were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to go armed with pitchforks, to find out this ghoſt, and the company, the female part, all went together, to get the reſt of their cloaths on; and the gentlemen the ſame; agreeing to meet in the large dining room to hear farther particulars. And Sir Greenfin Calipaſh, was to be ſeated in the grand chair, to take the examination.</p>
                     <p>While the gueſts were getting ready, all big with expectation, like the polite audiences in Cock-lane; a new noiſe alarmed them, an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, which was within the houſe, proceeding from the landlord, who having been put to bed very drunk, was by the continuation of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious noiſes waked; and parched with thirſt, bawled out loud as aſſes bray — <hi>ſome oat-ale, a tankard of oat-ale, and be—to ye.</hi>

                     <p>Dr. SINECURE, the learned profeſſor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur, begged leave to be heard upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, concerning the ſeeming contradiction of depoſition, in reſpect of the colour of the ghoſt. <hi>And then he coughed, and then he hemmed, and then thus went on.</hi> I am conſcious, my moſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent auditors, that I can clear this contradiction much to the ſatisfaction of the polite part of the aſſembly, I have now the honour to ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—becauſe—<hi>cough and hem again</hi>—I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ladies and gentlemen, I have not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the nature of ghoſts philoſophically; but by every rule of preſpective, as far as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the vaniſhing.—Have I, Sir Greenfin, your permiſſion to proceed? <hi>bowing low as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the preſident, the preſident as low down bowing in return.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon which the profeſſor of univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurſhip in arts and ſciences, looking about him with much conſequence, coughed, hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſpit, wiped his mouth, ſmoothed his foretop, ſpread his ſtock, pulled his ruffles, and began.</p>
                     <p>Every ghoſt, every ghoſt, and every appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every apparition as well as every ghoſt poſſeſſes in its own nature, two ſides or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperficies; which are denominated philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0187700100:111"/>an opaque ſide and a lucid one—<hi>cough</hi> —now the two witneſſes being, as it were, fixed or placed at oppoſite angles, ſaw the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſides of the ghoſt—for inſtance, the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who ſaw it a black ghoſt, had his rays of light abſorbed, by refrangibility of reflection, while the other had a view of the ghoſt, in his illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſtate ariſing from refraction; becauſe the radiancy of the rays, ſtriking upon the retina, and this pellucidity of ſhade, is called by the painters, the CLEAR OBSCURE—<hi>cough, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus therefore I form my hypotheſis—<hi>coughs</hi> —Suppoſe my left thumb to be A, my left little finger B, all my left hand C,—<hi>Hem</hi>—<hi>hem</hi>—now therefore, I ſay, A <hi>plus,</hi> B; B <hi>minus,</hi> C, becauſe every perſon being capable of ſeeing a dark or a light, that is an opaque, or a lucid ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, or ſide belonging to my finger and thumb, not only according as I form it into an inclined plain, then the ſhades and lights fly off in tangents of obtuſe angles, or if that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject refracted is diametrically oppoſite in a hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal parallel to the optic nerve; thus it was, one ſaw the apparition in a black or nigriferous point of ſight, and the other beheld it as a light, or illuminated appearance.—<hi>Cough, hem and ſpit.</hi>

                     <p>Had I, my moſt ineffable auditors, had I my books and inſtruments here, I might perhaps have demonſtrated this more clearly.</p>
                     <p>Sir Tim. Dowgate replied, it was clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and he apprehended every ſyllable on't—vaſtly clear indeed, lady Dowgate anſwered; the doctor's a moſt amazing man of ſcience, and I am poſitive has more true learning than all Doctors Commons.—Indeed lady Hadit obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nothing could have been delivered more
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0187700100:112"/>clearly, and ſhe underſtood every word on't. So do I, ſo do I, its immenſely clear, vaſtly ſo replied all the polite heap, and agreed, that as a ſcholar, an artiſt, an orator, and connoiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeur, Dr. Sinecure was quite the thing, and they were ſure on't.</p>
                     <p>The under-bred part of the aſſembly, allowed him to be a moſt wonderful man; and every one, gentle and ſimple, joined in praiſing loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his late lecture, and great learning; and they agreed he had made it out ſo well, that they all underſtood it.</p>
                     <p>The doctor condeſcended to incline his head in a direction, between a bow and a nod, with the utmoſt pedagogick conſequence.</p>
                     <p>Then Sir Green fin Calipaſh ſtood up, and tucking his neckcloth ends under his garnet breaſt buckle, he begged leave to obſerve, that as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the good of this nation his ſtudy, and would venture to ſay, that he knew both Old and New England's political conſtitution, as well as any one man in it. Yet he could not ſay, although he apprehended every thing doctor Sinecure had ſaid; yet he could not ſay he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the meaning of theſe affairs about black and white ghoſts; becauſe, though he believed in ghoſts as much as any chriſtian could; yet why ſholud ghoſts be black or white either? why might they not as well be of any other colours?</p>

                        <p>Indeed my lady, I'm no more a devil, than any other chriſtian body whatever, and I only want a little oat-ale, and that made me call Tom tapſter.</p>

                     <p>Coming, Sir, bawls the waiter, and down ſouſe on his poſteriors ſquaſhes Dr. Sinecure upon the hearth, and his teeth were looſened by the fall, for he ſtood upon Tom's ſhoulders, who bolted out in an inſtant; but over eager as he ſtooped to get out of the chimney, he beat his maſter down with his head.</p>
                     <p>The ſidelong attitude in which the landlord lay acroſs one of the benches, made lady Hadit burſt into a violent laugh; for it was, as her ladyſhip ſaid, <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſight—this mirth, and the preceding converſation, diſpelled the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's fears; they raiſed themſelves by degrees, or elſe were helped up. Tom and landlord went down, and the reſt retired to their ſeparate apartments.</p>
                     <p>The landlady waited upon lady Hadit, and would have made an apology for her huſband's rudeneſs in ſtanding naked before her.</p>

                              <p>I William Trip, mate of the Concord tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, captain Robert Farding, of Lynn Regis, maſter, do declare, that as we were coming from Liſbon, June 7, 1759; it happened to be my watch upon deck, I ſaw a bean cod overſet in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0187700100:119"/>our ſhip's wake, juſt as we were coming out of the Tagus.</p>
                              <p>We having not taking in our boat, I got down abaft, caſt off the painter, and ſkulled away, to pick up a perſon I ſaw floating, and brought him on board our veſſel.</p>
                              <p>The gentleman whom I got out of the water happened to be a Roman Catholic parſon, one whom they call in their lingo a Jeſuit, and who had got out of Portugal by ſtealth.</p>
                              <p>He was very ill while he was on board us, and I tended him. So one day, as we lay off the Wight, he ſent to ſpeak with me; and when I came, he deſired me to ſit down by him, and hear ſometing he had to ſay to me.</p>
                              <p>Upon which, that I might be, as one may ſay, yard arm and yard arm, with him, I got a coil of rope, clapt it aloft my ſea cheſt, brought it along ſide his hammock, ſo I ſet down on it, and our heads were then on the ſame latitude toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                              <p>So then he began (reaching out his hand on the ſtarboard ſide) ſays he, my good friend—you have been ſo civil to me, that I have no way to return your kindneſs, but by making you a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of this book of receipts, and telling you a piece of ſecret hiſtory, that you may make money of it, if you have a mind to print it.</p>
                              <p>You muſt know, Mr. Trip, that our ſociety, for many years, found our intereſt declining both in France and Portugal; and therefore our ſuperiors thought of re-eſtabliſhing themſelves in England.</p>
                              <p>Several miſſionaries that were ſent from Rome to England, aſſured us in their letters, that the Engliſh people would believe any thing, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0187700100:120"/>the ſyſtem or faſhion of the minds of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, of both the high and low life multitude turned upon an axis, whoſe points were CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEIT, and CREDULITY.</p>
                              <p>The ſucceſs which the methodiſts, and their doctrines met with, encouraged us greatly; nay our ſociety received ſeveral letters from their moſt eminent preachers in your iſland; and they told us, our miſſion would be received, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we joined them; and that upon particular pecuniary conceſſions on our ſide, they would unite with us. Becauſe they aſſured us, they muſt and would be of infinite ſervice to our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, ſince they knew ſo well how to work upon the multitude.</p>
                              <p>Before we would conſent to ſign any articles with them, we reſolved, from experiment, to diſcover how far we could venture to impoſe upon the people of England.</p>
                              <p>I was diſpatched upon that miſſion, and to prevent ſuſpicion, or the leaſt inquiry of what I was, I made intereſt to be engaged, as one of the ſubaltern players, belonging to the Theatre in London, only to do trifling parts; and when I was once ſeen upon the Stage in that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was impoſſible any perſon could ſuſpect I was good for any thing.</p>
                              <p>A brother of our order followed me with freſh inſtructions; but as his part required he ſhould be introduced at all hours, and in all places, to the very beſt company; he aſſumed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an Italian fiddler, tooth cleaner and deſigner; and when we have met to compare notes in an evening, he has made me ſmile, to hear him relate how every door uſed to fly open at his approach; and he would goſſip for two
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0187700100:121"/>hours with very great perſonages, while the anti-chamber would be full of colonels and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modores, waiting for an audience.</p>
                              <p>The earthquake was of my projecting, ſo was the bottle-conjurer, it was me who wrote the prophecy for the perſon called the life-guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but in reality he was porter to the Fanciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans at Padua.</p>
                              <p>He, as you may remember, foretold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the earthquake would happen ſuch a day, and Bloomſbury-fields, and Bloomſbury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, was filled with coaches; and whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies crammed in them, who there ſet all night, not daring to truſt themſelves in their own houſes. I ſmiled when I ſaw them thus huddled together; but was amazed to ſee many of your preachers hurrying out of town, as if they were panick ſtruck with the dread of leaving <hi>this</hi> world—when they are certain, there is one ſo infinitely preferable, and in which, by the doctrines they profeſs, they muſt be eternally happy.</p>
                              <p>Are they, thought I, only like phyſicians, who adminiſter medicines for the good of mankind, <hi>(as they ſay)</hi> yet have no faith in their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
                              <p>One afternoon, by chance, I met with Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Canning; ſhe had loſt ſix-pence, was cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, dared not to go home, ſhe ſaid—I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her, ſhe had the moſt ſtupid look, yet on converſing with her, I diſcovered ſhe poſſeſſed cunning and obſtinacy.</p>
                              <p>By the promiſe of making up her loſs, a new topknot, and the temptation of riding in a hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-coach, I prevailed upon her to go with me, and when ſhe was perfect in her part, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0187700100:122"/>her, as you muſt remember; this ſcheme anſwered, to prove Engliſh peoples aptneſs to embrace, or take part with incoherencies.</p>
                              <p>Rejoiced I was, when the gentleman, who endeavoured to detect the impoſture, met with ſuch oppoſition by his example. I was ſure other magiſtrates would be deterred from making any other ſtrict and impartial enquires—for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. Trip (thus the Jeſuit went on) though your nation is one of the beſt in the world, yet at preſent, folly and prejudice have ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo peſtilentially among all ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations; that any perſon, who now would en deavour to benefit his country from a praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy principle of integrity—So great is the defection throughout all degrees—ſo epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic the contagion of ſelf-intereſt; the patriot would be hooted at for a madman, reviled as a pretender, or puniſhed with contempt, and if poſſible with beggary.</p>
                              <p>Preferment makes the Engliſh nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have, juſt as the children of Iſrael did, when the manna fell among them, they ſnatch up all they can, overload themſelves often— no matter, by this method, leſs is left for their neighbours.</p>
                              <p>After this affair was over, I was ſent for back to Rome upon ſpecial affairs, relative to our ſociety; but I left a brother of our order full inſtructions how to proceed, and the plan for a project, that, as ſoon as he recovered, he was to put in execution; it was the COCK-LANE PHANTOM, or what was then called <hi>Miſs Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This was our moſt favourite ſcheme, this was our corner ſtone; we therefore employed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0187700100:123"/>more—I ſuppoſe he would have ſaid <hi>ſkill,</hi> but our ſhip, at that moment, by the wind ſhifting, took ſuch a luſt, that her lee-ruff-tree dipped in the water, and the Jeſuit was canted overboard out of his hammock, pitched his head upon the trunnion of a four pounder, and never ſpoke another word.</p>
                              <p>I was overſet, but I ſoon righted; but as for my companion, death clapped a ſtopper upon his tongue, as quick as one could crack a biſcuit.</p>
                              <p>And this is the truth, and the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, as witneſs my hand.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond is the winding-ſheet ghoſt, or torch-holding-immateriality; which is a loveſick maiden, that glideth along the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night dew, to undraw the feet curtains of her forſworn ſwain, and bidding him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0187700100:124"/>him of former affairs, of plighted troth and ruin'd maidenheads. She cometh in a white ſheet, to do pennance for being ſo fooliſh as to break her heart, hang, drown, or poiſon herſelf for love and conſtancy.</p>
                     <p>The third and laſt is the hobgobblin, or raw head and bloody bones—this is very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, and often uſed to appear to ſeveral particular perſons, both at ſea and land, an hour or two before an engagement—but it is at preſent, as well as the love-ſick ghoſt, almoſt out of faſhion.</p>

                     <p>Whereas Chloe, the wife of Muſter, what do you call um, was decoy'd away by one Knott, a Corporal; this is to give notice, that if ſhe will return home to her own lawful ſpouſe, ſhe ſhall meet with a hearty welcome, and no queſtions aſked.</p>

                  <p>The huſband's grief, was left to the reader's imagination. The Editor bequeaths the wife's joy to the ſame colouriſt, and as he made bold to carry her off, takes the ſame freedom to bring her home again; her huſband received her with all that joy, which every fond forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpouſe has felt, when, with out-ſtretched arms, he once more impounds his long ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lady.</p>

                              <head>A DISSERTATION on DAILY-PAPERS.</head>
                              <p>No Patriot, in or out of place, ever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their utility, with that grateful attention, theſe publications deſerve.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0187700100:128"/>Is there a want in the world, but what may be inſtantly relieved, if the patient will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the columns of thoſe morning and evening intelligencies? with as much gravity, as ever any one of the faculty pulled off his gloves; I do declare, that without the help of theſe dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaries for the day, the great buſineſs of the nation could not be carried on.</p>
                              <p>How could Mrs. Philips hope for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her cuſtomers? or the nobility and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try know where to pay in their Opera ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? where could they ſend for the beſt royal beautifying fluid? or could be ſure of having French chicken gloves genuine? how ſhould we know when Mr. Whitfield preaches in Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, or Georgia? or where we ſhould be ſure of Roman purl unadulterated? how ſhould we be aſcertained where the moſt notified Dr. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor performs his occuliſtical, or oratorial ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations? or where the beſt liquid blacking is to be got? where to ſend for the pure aetherial volatile quinteſſence of eſſence? or how could we be informed, that the ſea-water at Bright-Helmſtone, is better than any other ſea-water? were it not for being ſo inſtructed, by paragraphs and advertiſements aforeſaid. O credulity, cre-credulity, thou univerſal power, how much are we indebted to thy influences?</p>
                              <p>New diſcoveries, elixirs, lotions, injections, and noſtrums, for the ladies, are (as we read) to be had at every toy-ſhop.</p>
                              <p>Sometimes, indeed, the applications and uſes of theſe extraordinary ſuccedaneums are not expreſſed, in ſo delicate a ſtile, as polite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might wiſh. But when we conſider, the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0187700100:129"/>humane intent of the makers-up, and venders of theſe medicines, the ſtile is excuſed.</p>
                              <p>As in the country, we put up with the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of the entertainment, for the good will of the hoſt.</p>
                              <p>The humanity of the College of Phyſicians here muſt be noticed; they have an authority to inſpect into medicine-mongers; and can, nay, and ſhould, and I ſuppoſe do, viſit ſeveral places where drugs are ſold. Yet it never was known, that any deputation from Greſham College, or Apothecaries-hall, inſpected into the noted Dr. Franks, Dr. Sarrant, Dr. Rock, Dr. Jeſuit Drop, Dr. Greek Water, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This wilful omiſſion, is owing to the ſame public ſpirit, by which Mr. Aſhley on Ludgate-hill is agitated; gentlemen of the faculty, are willing to let every perſon have phyſic as well as punch, in ſmall quantities, and therefore wink at the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid advertiſers.</p>
                              <p>Yet ſuch is the malignity of humankind, that even this generous behaviour of the faculty has been found fault with; and the babbling pack of ſcandal yelpers bark out — that as quacks make diſeaſes worſe, the profits of the regular bred muſt be thereby increaſed.</p>
                              <p>Malicious inſinuations, as if gentlemen of the M. D. ſignatures, would be guilty of ſuch pitiful fineſſes. Thus the mad multitude have as baſely clamoured againſt the POLICE.—The low-life herd of hirelings give out, that truly, if the worthies in commiſſion would but take half as much pains to ſuppreſs the bawdy-houſes, bagnios, &amp;c. in their pariſhes, as they labour to take highwaymen, it would be of more benefit
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0187700100:130"/>to the nation in general—but how little do theſe people know of ſporting—if the cover was grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up, the breeding of game would be prevented; how then could money for a ſubſcription pack of harriers, tarriers, &amp;c. be collected?</p>
                              <p>With what force I ween?—but good heaven forgive us, God bleſs their majeſties, and every perſon who is commiſſioned by them, to ſee juſtice done as it ſhould be.—And as Mr. Jacob Henriques obſerves, it is all for the glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Old England.</p>
                              <p>When I mention the word quacks, it is not to be preſumed, that any gentleman recipe-ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, acting under letters patents, can be hinted at; becauſe we are all certain, patents are only granted to men of excellent ſcience, of approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed education, whoſe diſcoveries have been owing to indefatigable ſtudy, and are witneſs from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated experiments, before the moſt ſkillful, to be entirely calculated for the health and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the people of England.</p>
                              <p>Theſe, and many more uſes than theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to news-papers, they not only bring health to patients, but ladies to deſpairing lovers, and wives to huſbands, as in the caſe of Mr. and Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd now under our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; had it not been for the conveniency of advertiſing, when could they have come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again.</p>
                              <p>Yet David did not deſcend one grain from the dignity of in-bred honour, by permiting his wife to return home.</p>
                              <p>For while he had one ready-money cuſtomer left, his big heart deſpiſed ſubmiſſion; but when all his trade was loſt, the garriſon of his great
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0187700100:131"/>mind was forced to capitulate, his nobleneſs of ſpirit and blood of Japhet, were forced to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render priſoners of war, at and to diſcretion. <hi>He obeyed the times.</hi> Madam Llwhyddwhuydd gave him her hand, he kiſſed it—tears of joy ſwelled over his eye brinks, and he told her, in the name of God and good people, how his heart was glad to ſee her, to be ſure, and I do hope in deed, I do now.</p>

                  <p>She forgave him, and raiſed him with a tender reconciling look, equal to what the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged (though detected) lady can ſoften into, when her huſband has made a proper humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and giving up all his informers.</p>

                  <p>SOON after Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd's return, Mr. Ap Thomas, her ſpouſe's partner, with a full pot of porter in his hand, happened to run againſt her, juſt as ſhe came from her Sunday noon's walk in St. James's Park.</p>
                  <p>Her white ſatin trollopee was ſplaſhed with it, and the very ſmell of porter always made Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd ſick; becauſe perſons are apt to depiſe what they get their living by; her cloaths were ſpoiled, and ſuch cloaths too!—a dreſs, that the firſt dutcheſs in the land might have gone to court in.</p>

                  <p>The word vulgar, was grimgribber, to the ancient Briton; to be reflected upon, as if he was not a gentleman, irritated him to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he returned her ſevere words; with words yet more ſevere.</p>
                  <p>The writer of this part has ſerved his time to the knowledge of mankind, and ſince worked ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral year journeyman in that profeſſion; elſe he never could have believed ſuch words could have eſcaped any man's lips; who valued himſelf upon being a gentleman, as Mr. Thomas utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—He made uſe of ſuch phraſes, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if they were not in a paſſion, or choſe to be looked upon ſuperior to the ſcurrilous rank of informing conſtables, would rehearſe.</p>

                  <p>She went up to her chamber, and ſent for Miſs Shred, to conſult about repairing the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage done to her dreſs; then ſhe acquainted Miſs Shred, with Thomas's abuſe, repeating the very words over and over, and over again, and concluded, ſaying, No Miſs, upon <hi>my</hi> honour, I never can, or ever will forgive that

                  <p>And he ſays further, in exhorting all ſinners to regenerate.—Oh what a heavenly comfort it is, to conſider, that a ſinner, after running thro' a life of all wickedneſs, ſhall, only by attending on our tabernacle, be purified. Is it not a rich balſam for a ſore ſoul? therefore come unto us all ye who are afflicted, with the remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the methods, by which ye have got your wealth; and ye ſhall but give a tythe to us, by way of paying inſurance to the ſaints, who will

                  <p>All theſe ſentimental chapters, the Editor poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned; and therefore was obliged to cut out, and to turn over above 70 pages, before he could find the continuation of this Regiſter, which went on as follows.</p>

                     <head>The <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> for a LADY's LONGING.</head>
                     <p>David's lady ſoon had it in her power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her vow—the vow of revenge, which ſhe had ſolemnly taken to be even with Thomas her trollopee ſpoiler. Finding herſelf with child, to the great joy of her ſpouſe, ſhe told her huſband ſhe longed for a bite or two at his partner Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's noſe; and it was that which occaſioned thoſe learned quotations, inſerted in the firſt pages of this hiſtory. And if the reader pleaſes to remember Mr. David and his partner, in the midſt of that moſt claſſical converſation, were called away by the noiſe of chair, chair—juſt as Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd had fixed his ſtraps to the poles, a meſſage came that his lady was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken very ill; upon which hurrying away as faſt as he could with the fare, he returned to comfort his good woman, who that morning fell in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, occaſioned by her over care as an oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.</p>

                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0187700100:139"/>For though Madam Llwhyddwhuydd was big with child, and reckoned every hour, yet ſhe would needs go to market herſelf, becauſe ſhe ſaid, ſervants had ſo many ways of cheating their maſters and miſtreſſes. It happened, as ſhe paſſed by a public houſe, near the market, two people were quarrelling about the critical rules of the game of Put; the altercation being pretty high, the cards were thrown out at the window, juſt as this lady was paſſing by, and the knave of Clubs hit her upon the noſe. She was frighted, put into a chair, carried home immediately, and fell into labour in about half an hour. Her friends immediately prognoſticated, that from the incident of the knave of Clubs ſtriking her, it would be a boy; if it had been a queen, they ſaid, it would have been a girl, and that her ſon would, as he grew up, be an odd mortal, and as comical to look at, as the knave of Clubs was.

                  <p>After Madam Llwhyddwhuydd was put into bed, and her goſſips aſſembled, the good women ordered a man-midwife to be ſent for; but Mrs. Llwhyddwhuydd knowing the objection her ſpouſe had to men-midwives, was prudent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to refuſe ſuch aſſiſtance, becauſe ſhe was ſure it would offend her huſband's delicacy.</p>
                  <p>However, the other ladies were unanimous for a man. She entreated, ſhe begged, they were obſtinate; the diſpute was loud, it reached into the ſtreet, and every ſtall, chandlers-ſhop, and cellar-keeper in the pariſh aſſembled at the door, and determined, that as they knew David was ſent for, he ſhould not paſs into his own houſe, until they had his word and honour, to ſend for a man-midwife for his lady; for as each ſaid, if it was only for the look of the thing, he ſhould have one; David appeared, at that inſtant they ſurrounded him, as the print relates to you, much better than I can. However, one figure in it, I muſt beg leave to explain; which is, the big-bellied female, who ſeems to be full of grief—that lady, is ſpouſe to a moſt celebrated wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of political papers; and who has wrote very ſeverely againſt men-midwives; becauſe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to pay for their attendance, thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had refuſed their aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>She was a party deeply concerned in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and it afflicted her, to take notice of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids obſtinacy—he indeed once or twice at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſpeak—but it was a vain attempt; as he could not, we beg leave to ſpeak for him.</p>

                  <p>The putters together of thoſe daily and month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paragraph compendiums had proved, that no huſband of nice honour, would ſuffer a man-midwife; and as David was a man of the niceſt honour, how could he endure them?</p>
                  <p>In ſome papers it was hinted, that men-mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives could be of no uſe, becauſe the Indian women delivered themſelves.</p>
                  <p>In other papers it was inſerted, that in a ſtate of nature, there were neither men midwives, nor parſons; and that people could do well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both; and as how in the firſt ages, and the firſt ages were the beſt ages, and that this age was the worſt age; but in the firſt ages there were no arts, or ſciences, nor occaſion for any; that people would live better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, than with them; that neither man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or womankind had need for more help than the animals in the fields; or the fowls of the air; that it was only villainous cuſtom, evil habits, wrong tendencies, and the prejudice of education; that made us employ ſurgeons, tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, chymiſts, ſhoe-makers, men-midwives, dancing-maſters, ſnuff-makers, French-cooks, ſaddles, ſhirts, ſhifts, or pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
                  <p>From the information of thoſe weekly paid journaliſts, we may eaſily account why GREAT SCHOLARS, who ſtudy nature ſo nicely, are ſuch GREAT SLOVENS; as they know by their extreme ſkill, that we are not ſuperior to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0187700100:143"/>beaſts; they chuſe to retain as much brutality as poſſible in their behaviour.</p>
                  <p>David, like the traveller in the contention with the wind, wrapped himſelf up in his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tout, determined to ſtand out the tempeſt; when word was brought him, that madam Llwhydd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whuydd was brought to bed of a fine boy, and as like the father—</p>
                  <p>He would not ſtay to hear the reſt of the meſſenger's obſervation; burſting through the crowd, run home, and received the congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his company. Mr. Llwhyddwhuydd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rejoiced having a ſon and heir; and that was the utmoſt of his hopes, wiſhes, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, before he had read the obſervations above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. Yet now his principal ſatisfaction aroſe, from the reflection his lady was brought to bed without the help of a man-midwife.</p>

                  <p>Then, I would no more meddle with a pen and ink, than a lady in high keeping would mend her own linnen; for my mind ſcorns the drudgery of writing, reading, and reflecting, as much as any rich man in the kingdom can do.</p>
                  <p>My wife has an acquaintance, who promiſes to provide for me, either in the church, the navy, the law, the army, the cuſtoms, at court, or in the exciſe; it does not ſignify what branch it is; for if a man has but intereſt, he is fit for any place.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0187700100:152"/>Royal may be weak enough, or fond enough, or mean enough, and mercenary enough, to deſcend being upon the town. But who? (Mrs. Charke uſed to exult) who can ſay, they ever ſupped with the Queen of Sheba, at the Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, or had fair Roſamond at Haddock's?</p>
                  <p>This daughter of Colley Cibber, the late Poet Laureate, was a lady of ſurpriſing ſingularity; but the oddities of the human mind are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</p>
                  <p>There is his honour Sir ******, a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician; yet all his delight is chucking ſix-pence into a quart decanter.</p>
                  <p>Is not Mr. ***** the great phyſician, an admirer of parched peas; but cannot eat any, except what he cooks himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Mr. ***** the famous mathematician, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers battledore and ſhuttle-cock, to painting, poetry, and muſic; and don't we all know ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dignified ****, who, though amazingly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, value themſelves more upon their taſte, in veniſon, and Madeira, than in interpreting the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>Some ladies of diſtinction have been known to admire low company; their huſbands at the ſame time not caring for any; but it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to account why we are whim bitten. So far has oddity been epidemical, that noblemen have been known; nay, and ſeveral at this time are, really fond of their wives; and what is as remarkable, their ladies are as warm in their affections for their huſbands.</p>
                  <p>Our minds will be attached to irregularities. Miſs ***, with the fineſt eyes in England, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be near ſighted; and Lady *****, a moſt charming figure, drawn by elegance, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0187700100:153"/>dreſſed by grace—chuſes to appear round ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>Sir ******, one of our moſt eloquent ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a gentleman of amazing learning, believes he can ſpin a top, better than any other man in England, and wants to have 500 upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Rt. *****, who has ſeven of the fineſt children, perhaps in Chriſtendom, has impaired his eſtate, in purchaſing and preparing butterfly-wings, to line his ſtudy, in imitation of tapeſtry. And Mr. ***, the moſt eminent attorney in Great Britain, employs his whole time in gudgeon fiſhing.</p>
                  <p>This Mr. Warner above-mentioned, had an oddity of temper, which is uncommon among theatrical managers. He never looked upon his people, to be off the Stage as good as himſelf; he never choſe to countenance them as acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or be familiar with them as friends.</p>
                  <p>A fortnight or three weeks preceding the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough fair, he uſed to have a great levee of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the buſineſs, although at that inſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps out of employ; who would wait upon him, to know if he wanted any hands in the acting, ſinging, dancing, hocus pocus, or han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock and jannock way.</p>
                  <p>They uſed at firſt to come about dinner-time, and no perſon keeps a better-houſe than he does, or underſtands it better; there was always ſomething good in the pot, or roaſting at the fire. There would they walk up and down the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en — now glancing at the meat, now at the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſometimes darting their eyes down, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding into the dripping pan, then eagerly expectant, lift them up again to the boiler; and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0187700100:154"/>then they would ſtrut acroſs the kitchen, and ſpout; and ſay, <hi>to be, or not to be;</hi> and Jemmy would laugh, and whiſper me, ſaying, <hi>not to be eat by them colls, I aſſure you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of theſe paſſages I was remarking to Mr. Warner, and we were thinking of old af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and I juſt had told him of the dripping-pan, and the tragedy and comedy people, as Mr, Zaphaniel and the dancing-maſter came in; we went up one pair of ſtairs, and there I was ſhewn MASTER EDWARD and MISS ANN, walking arm in arm up and down the Skettle-alley.</p>

                              <p>YOU ſee Mr. Poet (obſerved the Dancing-maſter) you ſee there, that is Miſs NANCY, ſhe's a very deſirable girl, faith, as ſhowey a figure, as it is poſſible to repreſent.</p>

                              <p>I proteſt, Mr. Zaphaniel replied, ſhe is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt the daughters of delight — yea, ſhe is fair as the faireſt females of Judah.—She is more precious to my ſight, than the roſe of Sharon, or the ſnow-drops of Damaſcus; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily my friends, my heart beateth to behold her, and I would ſooner chuſe to have her within my fold, than both my fiſts full of the gold of ophir.</p>

                                 <speaker>DANCING-MASTER.</speaker>
                                 <p>This lady appeared firſt as a public performer at Sadler's Wells; for ſome years before ſhe had performed with the public, but never until then theatrically. As ſhe was extremely agreeable in her figure, and the novelty of her dancing added to it, with her excellence in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe ſoon grew to be a favourite with the town; and the enſuing ſeaſon, Nancy was engaged at Covent-Garden Playhouſe. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vaſtly celebrated, admired, imitated, and followed by every body; which is always the conſequence, when once a lady of pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the faſhion.</p>
                                 <p>The firſt night of her performance at the New Houſe, our hero, whoſe ſoul was ever agitated by love and ambition, confeſſed himſelf her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer.</p>
                                 <p>Let me do Maſter Edward this juſtice, to praiſe him for his emulation, in ſo ſpirituouſly aiming at every new part in comedy, which Mr. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick is famous for. Yet as every biographer is ſuppoſed to be the friend of the genius, whoſe life he celebrates, I would adviſe Maſter Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rather, hereafter, to ſtrike out a new caſt of acting for himſelf, where compariſons could not be made. In juſtice to his merit, it muſt be allowed, he, who is capable of being the maſter Stephen, the Miſer, &amp;c. &amp;c. has a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of comic abilities, to be, without buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonery, grimace or mimickry, a capital actor; and be held in a much higher point of character, than what at preſent he is. Although now he is the drole and comical one of the town, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0187700100:156"/>pleaſes them with his performances; it is in his power, not only to give pleaſure to an audience, but to gain their eſteem; and difficult as that part may be to act, it is worth his while to ſtudy it.</p>
                                 <p>Edward was in love to all the degrees, ſallies, and dependencies of deſparation.—The lady obſerved her conqueſt, and enjoyed it. She knew her man; had heard that, to his girls and his gameſters, he did not mind what money he threw away. He was a trout worth tickling, and therefore returned him look for look.</p>
                                 <p>Emboldened by this eye language, he began to contrive a ſcheme, for enlarging the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. He wiſhed to talk with her, but he wanted words — he wiſhed to write to her; but he wanted letters; therefore employed his landland, Mr. THOMAS PHILIPS <hi>(of whom more hereafter)</hi> to be his ſecretary.</p>
                                 <p>I cannot forbear mentioning a piece of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Neddy's to that old gentleman, who behaved in this affair extremely friendly to him; and yet ſo far can gaming abſorb all grateful principles, that Edward has betted twenty to five his landlord won't live until Lady-day next. The conceit of ſuch a bett has had a violent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the mind of the old gentleman. Mr. Pond alſo, to the beſt of my remembrance, has ſuch another wager. I have not, indeed, a ſyllable to ſay againſt Mr. Pond; he is as fair a ſportman as ever ſtepped up the ſtand; and pays his betts as punctual, as if he was a man of quality. Yet, after he has ſaid done to ſuch a bett; what buſineſs had he to drive Mr. Philips from Greg's coffee-houſe? it ſeems as if it was deſigned, as a heart-breaking ſtroke; ſince, to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0187700100:157"/>be debarred from that academy of univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, muſt be as great a damp upon the ſpirits of any of the curioſi; as it was to Buſſy Rabutin, to be baniſhed from the French court.</p>
                                 <p>When Miſs Ann became a principal dancer, ſhe had a friend, (a female one I mean) to wait upon her behind the ſcenes, to watch her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and take care of her ſteps.</p>
                                 <p>This duenna was her relation, and therefore had a more than ordinary care of her charge, leaſt detraction ſhould be malicious.</p>
                                 <p>The ogles which <hi>Neddy</hi> the drole, and <hi>Nancy</hi> the deſireable, reciprocally interchanged, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old lady guardianeſs. She trembled at the danger Nancy's honour was in; and ſoon as they came home that evening, thus began the moſt careful governante.</p>
                                 <p>I once thought, yes, that I did, Miſs Nancy, how you had a better ſpirit, and a more politer taſte, than to coquet it with a player—mercy upon us, what is our family fallen too, if this is the caſe? and ſo you're in love with the fellow, are you? I ſay, love too! I'll tell you what, child, when once any fine woman, like you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to give her company to people of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, who can pay her well for it; why there's no harm done—but for a lady to fall in love, it's juſt like a tradeſman dealing all upon honour, they had better ſhut up ſhop at once, my dear.</p>

                     <p>Lord, Madam, how you talk, as if I ever loved a man in my life, you know I never did; and yet you know I have had as fine men,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0187700100:158"/>as ever put laced cloaths on, and did I ever love any of um? how ſhould I, I have had too many and ſeen too much of them, to love them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed, I uſed to tell them I did; what then? that was no more than rehearſing one's part you know — as to love—why now, Madam, you know you have gone out a nurſing, and have a ſweet creature it was; and yet at the ſame time it was ready to make you ſick. Why ſo it is with us girls of the town, we kiſs men, and fondle them, and make babies of them, and tell them they are ſweet creatures, and yet, at the ſame time, they make us almoſt ſick—what then, it don't laſt long; and though the ſervice may be hard, it's ſoon over; and if the wages are good, what does it ſignify?</p>

                     <p>Why, now, didn't you but yeſterday read in one of thoſe ſix-penny blue covered books, there, that we take in monthly, and a charming libry they make, that's certain, — how that a great Roman Catholic Emperor, laid a tax upon peoples making water, and how his ſon found fault with him for it, becauſe it was a baſe thing; and didn't the father, as the book ſays, take up a piece of gold that was gathered by the tax, and bid his ſon examine, if it ſmelt of chamber-ly. So, madam, what does it ſignify, if we girls can but get money, who it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0187700100:159"/>comes from; do you think my mercer can tell one body's guinea from another?</p>

                     <speaker>GOVERNESS.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, child, but what guineas can you get from a ſhow-man?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>
                        <hi>Miſs</hi> ANN.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, mun, he no more minds money, than I do modeſty; but will give it away as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as I do my hair-combings. Beſides ma'am, the caſe is this, I ſhan't always look ſo well as I do now; for theſe curſed waſhes I uſe, for all they do give one's neck and face ſuch a fine whiteneſs, yet they make one's ſkin in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, look all crumpled, like a waſher-woman's fingers, and turns one's fleſh as yellow, as a peaſe-pudding. Now, you muſt know, that this young fellow, Ned, will always have a good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary from the Playhouſe; becauſe he is deviliſh comical, to be ſure; tho' he has not all the wit in the world neither—what then — the fitter for my purpoſe—if I can but perſuade him to marry me—why ſhouldn't I be made an honeſt woman of? and I will too — I have got ſome money, and I'd give it all, if I could but be made an honeſt woman; for it don't ſignify talking, but I can no more look a modeſt woman in the face, as I ſhould do, than I can ſay my prayers. I wonder what's the meaning of it; however, I don't deſpair, 'cauſe I know Ned's but a Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, and a girl may get him to do any thing; we are to ſup together to night.</p>

                  <p>This piece of mechaniſm, being juſt imported, was brought to my patron, for his countenance and inſpection, juſt after the footman came for me. He ſaw at once its moſt amazing utility; and cried out, BRAVO, before one wheel went about.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>I bowed — indeed, I bowed at every word I had conferred upon me; for, by the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have been empowered to make, in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt, grandeſt aſſemblies of my ſuperiors, I have noted, a bow, and a ſmile, and a curtſy, and a

                        <p>Your ſpeak, Sir, as every man of ſenſe ought to ſpeak. By men of ſenſe, I don't mean thoſe wretches, who pretend to be clever, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhoes to their feet, or dare to arraign the conduct of their betters; yet have not as much earth of their own, as will ſerve to bury them. <hi>They,</hi> Mr. Trip, ſhould be puniſhed; <hi>they</hi> ſhall ſtarve for their contumacy: but be <hi>you</hi> conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; <hi>you</hi> ſhall find your account in it. You are a man of ſenſe; your underſtanding, I don't doubt, is <hi>clear, ripe,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong;</hi> that is, <hi>clear</hi> enough to diſtinguiſh what is for your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; <hi>ripe</hi> enough to be ready for any thing; and <hi>ſtrong</hi> enough not to be biaſs'd by any of thoſe beggar-making bubbles of public ſpirit.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0187700100:175"/>Love, gratitude, friendſhip, freedom; thoſe, and other ſuch like terms, Mr. Trip, are only tubs toſs'd out for the whale, and which the hydra MOB call the harmonies and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>Next, you are to take care that, in your future writings, you rail againſt the liberty of printing, call it the licentiouſneſs of the preſs.</p>
                        <p>You are alſo to endeavour to inculcate the doctrine of non-reſiſtance; and to argue ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly for the eligibility of arbitrary power.</p>

However, <hi>you</hi> have a better way of thinking; and therefore keep company only with thoſe, who have nothing to do, and as little to ſay, and taſte the benefits of that tranquil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, which hardly any, but thoſe who have their fortunes made for them, are ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>

            <head>An Account of the Continuation of this Work.</head>
            <p>AN errand-boy belonging to the printer, vulgarly, and irreligiouſly called a Devil, hearing that, for want of an author, no more copy could be obtained to complete this volume, told his maſter, he knew a gentleman, who lodged in his mother's back garret; (the author and devil being bed-fellows) who, the boy ſaid, he was ſure would finiſh it; becauſe he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard the gentleman ſay, that as far as a pen and ink could go he would undertake any thing.</p>
            <p>The Devil being agent for both parties, a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was immediately ſtruck, between publiſher and author, whoſe name is CANNON, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, CAPTAIN CANNON, on account of his inventive faculty, or allegorical manner, in which he was won't to expreſs himſelf.</p>
            <p>This perſon appeared to be one of the EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRAORDINARIES OF THE TIMES, by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentatives againſt the late <hi>Orator Henley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe altercations, the loquacity of Cannon was ſo conſpicuous; he became a favourite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the people of exquiſite taſte, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a mountebank doctor; who admired the lad for the facility of his phyſical and metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical replies; and determined (even without the leaſt intereſt being made in the young fellow's behalf) <hi>ſtrange as it may ſeem,</hi> to encourage ſo promiſing a genius, therefore conſtituted him immediately his MERRY ANDREW.</p>
            <p>A widow lady, whoſe ſpouſe had ſuffered the ſeverity of the law, becauſe he endeavoured, upon
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0187700100:179"/>a belligerant principle, to inveſtigate the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal axiom, GET MONEY, fell in love with the Merry Andrew, for eating fire and tow; ſhe was then in equipage, by a very famous mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial writer; therefore the lady had power to recommend, or introduce Cannon to her friend; who made him his amanuenſis.</p>
            <p>Under this maſter, he became proficient in politics, and was properly initiated in the grand myſtery of myſteries, or the true art of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment writing, viz. to DEIFY the INS; and make DEVILS of the OUTS.</p>
            <p>The Methods he made uſe of in his Pickle-herring capacity, were of infinite ſervice to him in his political one. He was alſo a very good poſture-maſter; and that brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great eſteem among his ſuperiors; and he had hints that he ſhould be encouraged, equal to the moſt celebrated of the retained writers.</p>
            <p>He grew noted among the notified; he was ſuppoſed to have great intereſt with ſome people. It was whiſpered about, he was in the ſecret, therefore when in company, he abſtracted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accordingly.</p>
            <p>He began to conſider himſelf, and reflect, that ſuch a writer as he was, and engaged in ſuch connections, was liable to meet with a ſudden change of circumſtances, either for the better, or worſe, according to the weight, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, or prejudice of party.</p>
            <p>Upon a CHARIOT, and the PILLORY, he daily meditated; as they were both particular exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what he knew had been beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on different perſons very often, for the ſame action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0187700100:180"/>Conſcious of his own importance, he formed to himſelf a new ſyſtem of behaviour; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, wore, and bore an author-like conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>He had his ſhoes cleaned every day, and wrote E. S. Q. R. after his name. The wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at the coffee-houſes made bows to him; and the landlord at the Shakeſpear ſhook him by the hand. He had the liberty of the ſcenes, gave his opinion in the green-room, and told every body, how many days in the week he dined with my lord.</p>
            <p>Then he wore a ſword, and a ſnuff-box, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pity poor writers; hired a laced coat; and looked about him.</p>
            <p>At laſt, he condeſcended to tell the town him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was a man of wit and learning, and folks pointed at him as he went along the ſtreets, ſaying, <hi>That's</hi> HE.</p>
            <p>He drew his pen for preferment; and waged ſcurrilous warfare againſt all his betters, who were out of favour. He fought bluſhleſs, through the field of faction. He mangled the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, he deſpoiled the departed of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. VENALITY crowned his temples with a brazen frontlet; and trampling over the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len worthies, ſhe led him to the ſhrine of SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRET SERVICES; where the <hi>Oracle</hi> aſſured him protection and reward.</p>
            <p>At that time, there were numbers to provide for, who had been true ſervants of his HONOUR; and for whom, when no more vacancies could be made, new places muſt be contrived.</p>
            <p>This was the captain's caſe. He had the promiſe of being INSPECTOR GENERAL of the MILK OFFICE, within the bills of mortality;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0187700100:181"/>to prevent ſo wholeſome a commodity from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteration.</p>
            <p>The author of this ſalutary ſcheme was an Arabian; who came over here in Oliver's time, to get a patent for it; becauſe foreigners always are more ſtudious for our good, and ſtudy more for the benefit of this nation, than the Engliſh can do, or indeed dare do, for themſelves.</p>
            <p>But the Arabian was diſcovered to be in the Tartar intereſt; becauſe he endeavoured to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute mares milk inſtead of cows; to make us brew all our porter from oatmeal, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prove horſe-fleſh more wholeſome than ROAST BEEF.</p>
            <p>This project was thrown aſide for ſeveral years, until particular contingencies occaſioned it to be revived, as above mentioned; and all the proper attendants appointed, viz.</p>
            <list>

            <p>The multiplicity of friends, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, or ſomebody elſe had to oblige, procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the inſtitution; which made Cannon, about the year 1746, relinquiſh all his inſpecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial hopes, and be contented with the head la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of an author, mantaining himſelf by the ſweat of his brow, as poets, or proſe people, ſhould do.</p>
            <p>During the winter ſeaſon, he picks up a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty living, with ſeveral more ſuch ſubaltern genii, by putting together magazines, and memorandum books, penning murders, making rebuſes, and ſinging ſongs for both parties, and writing in news-papers againſt the players.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt do thoſe <hi>proſe writers</hi> the juſtice to declare, that they would not do ſo if they could help it.</p>
            <p>They acknowledge it is wrong, to prejudice the town againſt any performer; becauſe his bread may be loſt by it.—What then?—they had rather all the world ſhould ſtarve than themſelves; and ſtarve they muſt, if their works did not go off; and they can only ſend abuſe to market; well knowing, ſcurrility is always ſaleable; depraved appetites delight in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0187700100:183"/>things uncleanly; and ſome virtuoſi make col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of ſnakes, toads, ſpiders, monſters, deformities, dark lanthorns, and poiſon'd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
            <p>In the ſummer months theſe writers retreat into the country; mantain themſelves very decently, and indeed reputably, by making hay, and harveſt work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> The publiſher thus far has taken the liberty to premiſe, in behalf of the ſecond un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker of this performance, who now begs to be indulged in a word or two from himſelf.</p>

            <head>CANNON.</head>
            <head>To the READER,</head>
            <p>IT is with reluctance that I agreed to finiſh the Memoirs of this Comedian; becauſe I am not in amity with any Theatrical Profeſſors—having met with ſevere uſage from the ſuperiors of that Fraternity.</p>
            <p>At the age of 19 I did a Tragedy, not acted it, I mean (for I was always above being a player) but wrote one; which had not the leaſt bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy among the unities; and therefore I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured myſelf, I muſt have great credit for my manufactory.</p>
            <p>As to making intereſt, to have my tragedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended; though I was told, it was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to go to work; yet, being bigotted too much to the excellence of my piece, I deſpiſed ſuch advice; and was aſſured, within my own
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0187700100:184"/>mind, that it would be put into rehearſal by the manager, upon his firſt reading it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>multa cadunt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>However, by uſing the ſame chandlers-ſhop, I got acquainted with a young lady, whoſe ſiſter was dreſſer to a very celebrated actreſs.</p>
            <p>She invited me to drink tea with her ſiſter, the dreſſer, to whom I read my play; who approved of it mightily; becauſe, as ſhe obſerved, there was not much dreſſing in it.</p>
            <p>I had the honour of being introduced to the lady, her miſtreſs, who received me with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deportment; which, as Gil Blas obſerves, moſt of the ladies theatrical put on to ſtrangers, eſpecially if the viſitors are foot people.</p>
            <p>She ſtared at me, when I came into her room, ſo much, that I was prodigiouſly out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (a fault, of which even detraction will deny I am often guilty.)</p>
            <p>But recollecting it is the common look, which ladies bear, both on and off the ſtage, when they condeſcended to SEE their inferiors, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to come to myſelf.</p>
            <p>After I had been ſurveyed, as much as ſhe thought it conſiſtent with her dignity, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me, ſhe tinkled a ſilver hand-bell; and, on the maid's entrance, the lady, in a moſt delicate accent, ordered her ſervant to take the footſtool, which the actreſs was then reſting one foot upon,—carry it there, <hi>thus the lady pointing to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the room, ordered;</hi> put <hi>my</hi> footſtool there; that the man <hi>(pointing to me)</hi> may ſet upon it, and read his play to me, and bring my eau-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce, and my aether bottle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0187700100:185"/>Then, in the moſt engaging attitude, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined herſelf upon the couch, on which ſhe had before been ſeated, and looked like one of thoſe fine figures at the print ſhops, of Venus, or a Madona, or ſome ſinging or dancing lady in a repoſe, And thoſe graving and etchings are done by ſome great man, or after ſome great man's manner, as we are told in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues by <hi>auctioneers</hi> and <hi>picture-dealers,</hi> who have ſuch univerſal capacities, it is impoſſible for them to be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>They are the loadſtones of connoiſſeurſhip. The only judges of genius. Counſellors of taſte. Determiners of merit. Interpreters of ſcience; and leading-ſtrings, baits, bits, curbs, ſpurs, whips, wheels, levers, pullies, and primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles, for every lady and gentleman of fortune, who chuſe to be trammell'd into taſte, and be ambled about as connoiſſeur's hobby-horſes.</p>
            <p>Before I had read a page of my play, the lady interrupted me, finding great fault with my tones, with my emphaſis, and my accents.</p>
            <p>Swinging herſelf off the couch, ſhe aroſe with a graceful dignity, becoming a Penelope; the gold fringe of her ſlippers playing to her feet, her ſilk train ſweeping along the carpet; then flouriſhing her white handkerchief, the lady ſpoke three or four ſpeeches of Caliſta, to ſhow me how people ought to deliver tragedy. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, when ſhe had again ſeated herſelf, as ſhe looked into the lid of her patch-box, ſhe enquired if I had ſeen her play all her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and which I liked her beſt in.</p>
            <p>My reply was <hi>(for I had a hint given me, not to be ſparing of compliments)</hi> that where every one
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0187700100:186"/>was excellent, it was impoſſible to perceive an inferiority.</p>
            <p>She ſmiled, with the utmoſt complacency, upon me; ſhe took my MSS. promiſed me it <hi>ſhould</hi> be done, and ſuffered me, kneeling, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the back of her hand, as I took my leave; but meeting at the door a perſon very richly dreſſed, I was ordered to walk in again.</p>
            <p>This viſitor to the lady was in a velvet coat, embroidered; a gold tiſſue waiſtcoat, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and every other part of his apparel equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich. I took particular notice of his watch chain, it was remarkably long, and as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably filled; for I counted no leſs than ten vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeals, and toys in different ſhapes, upon it.</p>
            <p>The gentleman was a very eminent haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher, and a great friend of the lady's, as I heard afterwards. He ſtared at me alſo; full as much as I had been ſtared at before—then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gentlewoman, he aſked her, in very ill pronounced French, Who the Devil I was?</p>
            <p>She replied, an author.</p>
            <p>I thought ſo, he replied, <hi>ſtill in French;</hi> and ſwore a great oath, at the ſame time—I thought he was a ſhabby genius, of ſome ſort, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—but now my angel we'll have ſome fun with this fellow, I ha'ant roaſted a ſcribbler a great while: for damn me, if theſe authors, not one in a hundred of um, have any thing to ſay to a gentleman as they ſhould do; becauſe they are blockheads, and ought to be caned, kicked, or dragged through a horſe-pond; for what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have they to think about their betters.</p>
            <p>I would not diſcover to him or the lady, that what they ſaid in French, was underſtood by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0187700100:187"/>me; but allowed him to the length of his tether, without interruption; and he accordingly aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that contemptuous behaviour, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy inſolence, which the wearers of fine cloaths conceit they have a power to beſtow on the wearers of plain ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hear what their honours</hi> ALL <hi>ſay.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Every perſon muſt be a ſcoundrel, a Lyar, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, illiterate, damned contemptible, deſpicable, filthy, fulſome, horrid, vile, vulgar, baſe, odious, and one of the</hi> MOB, <hi>who is not a perſon of fortnne, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion or family,—vide the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fine dreſſed gentleman haberdaſher feating himſelf by the lady, his leg acroſs her lap, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one hand to his ſide, and with the other chinking the ſeals at his watch chain—yawn'd— then leaned back—yawn'd again—then bending ſuddenly forward, fixed his eyes full upon me; ſeeming, as Falſtaff, ſays, <hi>to awe with a ſtare.</hi>

               <p>O dam it, Sir, as to that, I have a better memory than any man in England, and thoſe two lines I ſpoke are <hi>Horace</hi>'s, and I'll bet you 50 l. on't; and out he pulled a green purſe, ſeemingly full of money; which, in his eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he let fall upon the tea-table, and broke a cup and ſaucer, belonging to a ſet of French china, that had been preſented to the lady by a former lover; and which ſet ſhe told the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe would not have had deſtroyed for 500 pounds.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>A ſtrange ſcene of altercation enſued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches roſe high between them—until the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, ſwore ſeveral of the moſt horrid oaths, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs could put together, that he never would ſpeak to her again; and hurried out of the room, bouncing the door after him, as violently, as if, like Sampſon, he would ſhake the houſe down about us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0187700100:198"/>After the paſſionate departure of her friend, the lady addreſſed herſelf to me—but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, different from that ſhe received me with.</p>
            <p>Affectation was away—the haughtineſs of the actreſs was baniſhed; and only the fine woman of affability appeared.</p>
            <p>Deſiring me to ſit down, with a look, that ſpoke the moſt delicate ſenſibility; the lady told me—I believe, Sir, I am not the only perſon in this room, whom the hot-headed man, that has juſt left it, made uneaſy this morning; for if I gueſs right, your face told me, you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood every thing he ſaid to me in French about you.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>AUTHOR.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, madam, I underſtood every ſyllable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>LADY.</speaker>
               <p>I thought ſo, by heavens! I thought ſo, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your behaviour, Sir, and will endeavour to recompence you, for the pain of mind I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious you muſt have endured; too much I feel of that myſelf; what are all diamonds, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, fine furniture, and elegance of dreſs, when the mind, retreating into itſelf, ſhrinks back aſhamed to reflect on the means by which thoſe are purchaſed. Yet I muſt act the hypocrite, I muſt conform—conform to thoſe I hate, nay worſe—bear with rich ſtupidity, applaud with ſeeming attention, arrogant dulneſs; and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even fondly flatter, indelicate folly. Sure of all ſlavery, mine is the worſt! where the will is not left free; what is—</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0187700100:199"/>Thus ſhe gave vent to her reflections; as ſhe walked up and down the room, tears following one another, down the damaſk of her cheeks, tranſparent as dew drops, upon the roſe leaf.</p>
            <p>At that moment, her lover, the gentleman haberdaſher returned, and diſcovering her cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, run to her, took her in his arms, forced her to the ſettee, and kneeling down before her, begged her to forgive him; deſiring her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a ring he held out to her, and vowing, that had he known his leaving her ſo abruptly, would have ſo deeply affected her, he would not have done it for all the world.</p>
            <p>The lady's face at this time ſeemed agitated with aſtoniſhment, and diſdain, by turns; but I had not an opportunity any longer to obſerve it. Her friend addreſſing me that inſtant, with, <hi>you'll excuſe us this morning Mr. Writer, I ſhall be glad to ſee you ſome other time.</hi>

               <p>Aſſured of my play being preſented, I ſought ſome time for a proper perſon to dedicate it to; one from whom I could expect the greateſt advantages; one, who could do me great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if I did but properly apply myſelf, and blazon forth his merits to the WORLD.</p>
               <p>I had a ſufficient quantity of matter by me which I had abſtracted from the Greek, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and French panegyricks; and alſo from the works of moſt of our beſt writers, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; from whom I had borrowed the choiceſt phraſes, which they made uſe of in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Divinity. All theſe things I had
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0187700100:200"/>ready marſhalled, to appear in rank and file, before the public, in behalf of my patron, as ſoon as I could find one.</p>
               <p>Being for ſome time troubled with bad eyes, becauſe the room where I write, lay, and cook my victuals, ſmokes terribly; and as I dread blindneſs more than any other diſtemper, I gave up all thoughts of baiting my works with great mens defence, and turn penſion or place fiſher.</p>
               <p>I conſidered my natural defects ought to be firſt remedied; therefore to the OCCULIST CHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VALIER TAYLOR, SENIOR, I addreſſed the following dedication.</p>

               <p>You do? then, my dear, you are guilty of a very indelicate ſuppoſition. Are ladies of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion to turn wet-nurſes, and have their heads horridly diſtracted by the noiſe of the nurſery, or vapoured to death with cradle-rockings? is it taſte? — I aſk you, my dear, upon your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is it taſte, for <hi>me,</hi> who come of ſuch a family as I am come from, to have a child dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at my breaſt, as beggars carry their brats.

               <p>There, my dear, you muſt be wrong; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely wrong, upon <hi>my</hi> honour.—<hi>Your</hi> family may be the more ancienter in England; but <hi>my</hi> family is from America; we were the anceſtors of five original nations of the SENEKAS, from whom came the CHIKASAS, from whom
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0187700100:206"/>came the CATAWAWS, from whom came the CHEROKEES.</p>

               <p>But I tell you <hi>my</hi> family is the moſt ancienteſt in the world; ay, and in America to boot; for they did go into the Ark, as game-keepers to ſquire Noah; and his worſhip's ſon did marry queen Winifred; and from whom came the Cadwalladers; and from whom came the Tudors; and from whom came the Llwhuyddwhuydds.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>She</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and from <hi>my</hi> family came the <hi>Cherokee,</hi> and the</p>

            <p>Then they raiſed their voices at the ſame time, louder and louder, until out of breath, and black in the face, they ſtood ſpeechleſs, ſtaring at one another, like a pair of pitted turkey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks.</p>
            <p>The lady firſt recovered, and giving her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a look, blended with ſcorn and reproach, that look, which fine women know ſo well how to wear <hi>(beating a tatoo with her feet, and hitting the tea-ſpoon upon the edge of a ſaucer)</hi> thus ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry, Sir, that I ſhould ſo far forget myſelf, as to contend with you about families. Upon my honour, I ſhall, for the future, take care how I ever enter into any ſuch arguments with you, and immediately fell into a violent fit of the ſullens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had I but time to analyſe that diſtemper, and point out the methods of cure, how happy ſhould I
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0187700100:207"/>make many huſbands? but a more intereſting ſcene preſents itſelf,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>David, kneeling at his wife's feet, moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically begging her to be good to him, to ſpeak to him, to look at him, or let him take hold of her hand.</p>
            <p>But all his addreſs was vain—vain, as the petition diſtreſs preſents; vain, as the hopes of wit; or pretenſions of undower'd beauty and virtue.</p>
            <p>Mr. Llwhuddwhuydd was forced, before the preliminaries could be ſigned, to give up (upon his knees) every original branch of his family, and allow, both lineally and collaterally, the ſuperiority of his lady's anceſtry.</p>

               <p>I beg, my dear huſband, now you'll riſe, — I chuſe it—there's my hand, I offer it to you as a token, I don't take any thing ill,—I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and forgive; it is taſte to do ſo; and I'll ſuffer death, before I would be impolite.

               <p>He ſhall be put to ſchool, as ſoon as he goes into breeches; and he ſhall be kept at learning, Latin and Greek for 12 or 14 years, to be ſure; becauſe I will have him a great ſcholar, and then I will bind him prentice—</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. LLWHUDDWHUYDD.</speaker>
               <p>No, excuſe me—he may be a ſcholar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; I am not againſt that; becauſe, perhaps one day, or another, ſuch a thing may be taſte. But I renounce his being 'prentice, there's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo vulgar in it, — no, let him go into the army. I am certain, that as you have carried
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0187700100:208"/>ſuch a number of people of faſhion, for ſo many years; and as they are under great obligations to you, for the care you have always took of them, they would not deny you ſuch a ſmall favour, as to give your ſon a commiſſion.</p>

Is not every genius deſpiſed by the politeſt people; do not the perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty call creatures ſo out of contempt, my God! did you ever know any body of faſhion a genius — no, Mr. Llwhuddwhuydd, inſtead of bringing your ſon up a genius, let him be a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; let him keep gentlemen company, not but, I muſt ſay, if his genius could turn to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics—</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And pleaſe God ſo it ſhall; I will bind him 'prentice to a politician; and when he is out of his time, he can ſet up for himſelf, and provide for his relations.</p>
