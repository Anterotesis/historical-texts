            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In both theſe points, Harry, I have been lucky enough to ſucceed—During the courſe of my ſauntring duty in the Park, with the nurſery maids, I met with a very fine girl, who has a conſiderable fortune in her own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but may expect a much greater if, ſhe marries with the conſent of the old folks—of them I know nothing—The young thing is entirely mine—and I am fooliſh enough to be in love with her.</p>

                  <p>There you muſt excuſe me. As you ſaid, I muſt be ſurer of my point, before I open myſelf, even to you—Lady Matchem has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me the characters of the family, which ſtand thus—The girl amiable and handſome, with a conſiderable fortune in her own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; but as you ſaid of yours, if papa and mama conſent, may have a much greater. The father is a man who has all his money in the ſtocks, and though he lives on this ſide Temple-Bar, is as ignorant of good company as if he had never removed from Thames-Street: all his time is taken up in liſtening to news, picking up intelligence, and buying in and ſelling out accordingly—The mother's only joy is cards and governing her family, which ſhe does with as much authority, as her huſband's obſtinacy will let her. She has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to open the matter to him, and this afternoon, I am, perhaps, to have the honour of an introduction to him. More I'll tell you when I know more.</p>

                  <p>Apoplexy!—eat as hearty a dinner at Gird ler's-Hall, as man could eat, and was dead before he could ſwallow church and ſtate, ſtiff before the ſecond toaſt could go round! Ah! the new paving of the ſtreets killed him—Ah! the fatal effects of luxury! they will never leave their curfed improvements till they have killed us all—But, my dear, there's rare news from the Alley, India ſtock is mounting every minute.</p>

                  <p>You think ſo, do you? I have thought ſo any time theſe three years, and ſo has Emily too, I fancy—I wanted to talk to you upon the ſame ſubject.</p>

                  <p>Jump, quotha! no, on my conſcience I ſhould wonder they did—and how comes it now to paſs?

                  <p>No, you ſhall find I am not mad, Mr. Grub; that I know how to diſpoſe of my child, Mr. Grub—what, did my poor dear brother leave his fortune to me and my child, and ſhall ſhe now be diſpoſed of without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting me?</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0054902400:35"/>upwards of fifty years—up early, down late, ſhop-keeper, and houſe-keeper, made a great fortune, which I could never find in my heart to enjoy. And now, when all the comfort I have in the world, the ſettlement of my child is in agitation—ſhall I not ſpeak, ſhall I not have leave to approve of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</p>

                  <speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear, what do you think of this buſineſs?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. GRUB.</speaker>
                  <p>Why I think, my dear, that as we can't help ourſelves, we may as well make the beſt on't. What's done can't be undone, and it's well it's no worſe, as was always the ſaying of my poor dear brother, Sir Tympany.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>GRUB.</speaker>
                  <p>Egad I believe he was right, and I may as well make the beſt on't; for if I don't give' her away, ſhe'll throw herſelf away. But I hope you won't follow the example of the great; there is ſuch work among them!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. BEVIL.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Sir, don't nouriſh ſuch ſtrange preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. The great have their follies, tis true, but they have alſo their virtues, as well as the reſt of mankind; and there are among them many ſhining objects of inmitation: we ſhould conſider, Sir, that the Greateſt Couple in the nation is the beſt and happieſt in it.</p>
