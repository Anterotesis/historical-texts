            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is matter of great doubt whether any dedicatory addreſs was ever freer from taint of flattery, than the preſent; if we pronounce you the beſt illuſtrator of, and the beſt <hi>living comment</hi> on, SHAKESPEARE, that ever has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, or poſſibly ever will grace the Britiſh ſtage, it is merely echoing the public voice, and concurring with that unparalleled unanimity of praiſe, which, during ſo long a courſe of years, hath attended your incomparable merit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1018102000:3"/>This compact edition of SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE is offered you as a grateful, tho' ſmall, return, for the infinite pleaſure, and extenſive information, derived from your exquiſite perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and judicious remarks, by,</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>SHAKESPEARE's admirers, even the enthuſiaſtic ones, who worſhip him as <hi>the god of their idolatry,</hi> have never ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to admit that his moſt regular pieces produce ſome ſcenes and paſſages, highly derogatory to his incomparable general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; he frequently trifles, is now and then obſcure, and, ſometimes, to gratify a vitiated age, indelicate: but can any degree of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical taſte wiſh the preſervation of dark ſpots, becauſe they have grown upon dramatic ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine? is not the corrective hand frequently proved to be the kindeſt? critics, like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſhould neither ſpare the rod, nor uſe it wantonly.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but all our author's faults may juſtly be attributed to the looſe, quibbling, licentious taſte of his time; he, no doubt, upon many occaſions, wrote wildly, merely to gratify the public; as DRYDEN wrote bombaſtically, and CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GREVE obſcenely, to indulge the humour, and engage the favour of their audiences: no man can ſuppoſe that the former conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his rhiming dialogues as marks of ſublimity, nor that the latter imagined his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1018102000:5"/>
               <hi>double entendres</hi> were wit; one wanted money, the other fame; for which, pompous ſounds and groſs ideas, were then popular baits; conſequently, chaſte criticiſm and delicacy were without ſcruple, ſacrificed to their ſeveral views.</p>
            <p>Our author did not go quite ſo far, but very frequently preſerved himſelf free from taint, reining his fiery PEGASUS with an able maſterly hand; why then ſhould not the noble monuments he has left us, of unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valled ability, be reſtored to due proportion and natural luſtre, by ſweeping off thoſe cobwebs, and that duſt of depraved opinion, which SHAKESPEARE was unfortunately forced to throw on them; forced, we ſay, for it is no ſtrain of imagination, to ſuppoſe that the Goths and Vandals of criticiſm, who frequented the theatre, in his days, would, like thoſe who over-ran the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, have deſtroyed and conſigned to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous oblivion, the ſublime beauties which they could not reliſh; and it is matter of great queſtion with us, whether the fool, in <hi>King Lear,</hi> was not a more general fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, than the old monarch himſelf.</p>
            <p>The above conſiderations firſt ſtarted the idea, and induced the undertaking, of this edition; and as the THEATRES, eſpecially
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1018102000:6"/>
of late, have been generally right in their omiſſions, of this author particularly, we have printed our <hi>text</hi> after their regulations; and from this part of our deſign, an evident uſe will ariſe; that thoſe who take books to the THEATRE, will not be ſo puzzled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to accompany the ſpeaker; nor ſo apt to condemn performers of being imperfect, when they paſs over what is deſignedly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Upon this point, however, it is to be obſerved, that the difference of power, of voice and execution, between different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, may make one eraſe more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nevertheleſs we come ſo near the mark of all, that ſcarce any perplexity can ariſe, in tracing them; beſides we would hope, that a reaſonable ſtandard being thus laid down, profeſſors of the drama will not be ſo forward, as capriciouſly and arbitrarily to deviate from it; it is commendable to conſult the extent of expreſſion, but thro' idleneſs to retrench what is beautiful and neceſſary, or through vanity to retain what is heavy and uneſſential to action, we deem an affront to the public, and a diſgrace to the performer.</p>
            <p>As an author, replete with ſpirited ideas, and a full flow of language, eſpecially one poſſeſſing <hi>a muſe of fire,</hi> cannot ſtop exactly where ſtage utterance and public attention
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1018102000:7"/>
require; ſome paſſages, of great merit for the cloſet, are never ſpoken; ſuch, though omitted in the text, we have carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the notes.</p>
            <p>And now, being upon this part of our ſubject, we hold ourſelves bound in juſtice and gratitude to Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> to mention a delicate fear, which he ſuggeſted, when we firſt ſolicited his ſanction and aſſiſtance. This fear was, leſt the prunings, tranſpoſitions, or other alterations, which, in his province as a manager he had often found neceſſary to make, or adopt, with regard to the text, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of repreſentation, or accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the powers and capacities of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, might be miſconſtrued into a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical preſumption of offering to the literati a reformed and more correct edition of our author's works; this being by no means his intention, we hope it will not become liable to ſuch an unmerited miſconſtruction. In juſtification of ourſelves alſo, we take this opportunity of declaring, that to expect any thing more of this work, than as <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the theatre,</hi> is to miſtake the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the editors.</p>
            <p>Having been long convinced that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying conjectural verbal criticiſms, tends rather to perplex, than inform readers; we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1018102000:8"/>
have given thoſe readings which to us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt conſonant to our author's manner and meaning, without obtruding one capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opinion on another.</p>
            <p>We have furniſhed an explanation of technical and obſolete terms; pointed out the leading beauties, as they occur, without deſcanting ſo much as to anticipate the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's conception and inveſtigation; we have ſhewn, with a becoming impartiality, what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us to be blemiſhes and imperfections: the requiſites for repreſenting every character of importance are defined, and the mode of performance eſſential for ſcenes pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly capital, is clearly pointed out.</p>
            <p>We have earneſtly conſulted correctneſs, neatneſs, ornament, utility, and cheapneſs of price; we have avoided all oſtentation of criticiſm, compacting our notes as much as poſſible; in regard whereof, it may be juſtly ſaid, that we could have enlarged the number, and extended the phraſeology, with much leſs trouble, than it coſt us to give them their preſent form; it has been our peculiar endeavour to render what we call the eſſence of SHAKESPEARE, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and intelligible; eſpecially to the ladies and to youth; glaring indecencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, and intricate paſſages explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1018102000:9"/>
and laſtly, we have ſtriven to ſupply plainer ideas of criticiſm, both in public and private, than we have hitherto met with.</p>
            <p>A general view of each play is given, by way of introduction.</p>
            <p>Though this is not an edition meant for the profoundly learned, nor the deeply ſtudious, who love to find out, and chace their own critical game; yet we flatter our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both parties may perceive freſh ideas ſtarted for ſpeculation and reflection.</p>

            <head>ESSAY ON ORATORY.</head>
            <p>THOUGH it is not ſtrictly within the limits of our plan, to range at large over the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive field of oratorical correctneſs, fancy and excellence, as it reſpects the pulpit, ſenate, and bar; yet it is hoped we ſhall ſo far touch on the eſſentials of them all, as to give hints, which may prove uſeful to each of the three degrees.</p>
            <p>If we ſay that an orator, like a poet, to excel, ſhould be born ſuch, it will be no ſtrained aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if we add that he muſt be more indebted to nature, than a ſon of the muſes, it will be eaſily admitted. Cultivated imagination, regulated by judgment, conſtitutes one; who, totally void of external requiſites, may ſhine from his cloſet, tho' ever ſo deformed in figure, rude in features, weak in voice, or blemiſh'd in appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1018102000:11"/>The other, though he may, by peculiar excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of delivery, and the help of a feeling ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject well treated on, be able to impreſs an audience, with little more than a good voice; yet experience powerfully convinces us that a graceful perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable marking features, expreſſive eyes, and ornamental geſture, are of the utmoſt utility: it is no argument to ſay, that a man, as in the caſe of Sir <hi>John Fielding,</hi> tho' the viſual gates of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy be ſhut, may ſhow ſtrong marks of oratorical merit; for the queſtion naturally follows, would he not be much more powerful in expreſſion, if the indexes of thought enjoyed their natural and proper vigour, eſpecially where particular feelings are to be excited?</p>
            <p>It is too common for ignorance and avarice, to miſapply the talents of youth, eſpecially in this point of view; many are deſtined for, and brought up to the moſt ſerious, the moſt important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of life, wherein public ſpeaking is required, who labour under glaring defects and imbecilities of expreſſion; hence ſo many drowſy, irkſome preachers, ſo many ſenatorical cyphers; and ſuch a number of imperfect pleaders: this parental blunder is much the ſame as breeding a purblind boy to watchmaking, or one hard of hearing to muſic.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing a perſon qualified by nature, let us ſee how far art may be called in. The complete orator muſt have a general and intimate knowledge of himſelf, the world and mankind; a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the paſſions and affections of thoſe he is to inſtruct and perſuade; a perfect acquaintance with the various diſtinctions of virtue and vice; he ſhould be critically intimate with all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and blemiſhes of the ancient writers; he ſhould
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1018102000:12"/>
be an hiſtorian and a logician; poſſeſſing a correct idea of, and taſte for, the liberal arts; if a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of the mechanical ones is added, ſo much the better; he ſhould poſſeſs a quick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and a retentive memory; he ſhould be able to break thro', with eaſe, the cobwebs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, and, above all, enjoy that grand ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient recommended by CICERO, ſocial philoſophy.</p>
            <p>He ſhould be maſter of all the arguments, for and againſt his ſubject; in ſhort, to ſum up all with the great <hi>Roman</hi> orator's own words,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he ſhould be furniſhed with logical acuteneſs, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical wiſdom, and poetical imagination, embelliſhed with the moſt poliſhed elocution and geſture of the ſtage."</q>
            </p>
            <p>To expatiate upon the obvious advantages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveable from each of the above qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to complete this very comprehenſive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter we are conſidering, would be to ſpin out a needleſs length of explanation; which could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no end, but anticipating the reader's reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inveſtigation; wherefore we ſhall quit this point, with obſerving, that when ſo many requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, both internal and external are neceſſary, it is no wonder that a complete orator is ſo very ſcarce a character.</p>
            <p>Declaimers, who may be juſtly ſtiled the pageants of oratory, poſſeſs the flowery, but not the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, part; they appeal boldly to fancy and the paſſions, but cautiouſly ſhun rational inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhew and plauſibility completely <hi>ſet</hi> up one of this dangerous kind of public ſpeakers, who oftener make proſelytes among the weak and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than ſound orators do; as they are moſtly pleaſing, tho' ſeldom inſtructive. Biſhop <hi>Sprat,</hi> ſpeaking of them, in his hiſtory of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1018102000:13"/>
emphatically ſays,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"of all the ſtudies of men, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſooner obtained, than a vicious abundance of phraſe; the trick of metaphors, and a volubility of tongue."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having come thus far, the three celebrated ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of antiquity ſeem to fall in the way; DEMOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THENES, ISOCRATES and CICERO; the firſt ſpoke from the heart, the ſecond from the head; the firſt was animated by his ſubject and powerfully enforced it; the ſecond decked it profuſely with rhetorical flowers; one flaſhed conviction, by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable imagery; the other amuſed imagination, with fantaſtical alluſions: of ISOCRATES we may ſay, his eloquence reſembled a pleaſant, but ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſtream, which tickles the ear with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able murmuring: DEMOSTHENES a deep majeſtic current, that in its courſe thunders on attention, and bears down all oppoſition: ISOCRATES poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes eaſe and elegance, DEMOSTHENES power and perſwaſion; CICERO who riſes far above the former, does not in our idea come up to the latter; he is however a very maſterly mixture of both, and therefore more likely to obtain general admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than either of his predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Oratory is well defined <hi>the exerciſe of eloquence</hi>; eloquence the <hi>fluency of ſpeech</hi>; and rhetoric the <hi>guide of both.</hi> It is odd that theſe three terms ſhould frequently be uſed as ſynonimous, when they ſo eſſentially differ.</p>
            <p>Oratorical compoſition ſhould be founded on a progreſſive unity of parts, but not like ſome of our ſermons, which are diſgraced with inſipid metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical formality commonly ſtiled <hi>heads</hi>; it ſhould enter modeſtly upon, warm into the ſubject, and, if required, kindle to fire, when the audience are ready to receive heated impreſſions; an impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1018102000:14"/>
exordium generally produces a cold conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that piece, which endeavours to catch attention too ſuddenly, will either not catch it at all, or be obliged ſoon to let it ſlip.</p>
            <p>FENELON, ARCHBISHOP OF CAMBRAY, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Beauties of Eloquence, ſpeaks to the following effect:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Of what uſe can any ornament be, that does not tend to prove, to paint, or to affect? thoſe ornaments, which only pleaſe, are falſe beauties; thoſe which pleaſe and perſuade, ſolid ones; the juſt and natural emotions of an orator have much grace and beauty in them; his correct and ſpirited painting charms us; all the eſſential parts of eloquencce tend to pleaſe; but merely pleaſing is not the moſt important aim; ideas and expreſſions, which only tickle the ear, may be deemed quaint turns; all graces of ſtyle, which ſerve to invigorate perſuaſion, are to be wiſh'd for; but all witty, punning conceits, all quibbling upon words, all ſtrained metaphors, all forced glaring imagery, and all luxurance of idea, which only ſerve to flaſh and glitter upon fancy, diſgrace ſound oratory."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In public ſpeaking, as well as in poetry and painting, art ſhould be carefully concealed: where perceptible, it has a coarſe and mean aſpect. The orator ſhould ſo intirely poſſeſs his audience of the ſubject, as to make them forget the ſpeaker.</p>
            <p>From the affecting exclamation of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cicero,</hi> and a dilation of it, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how expreſſion ſtrengthens, or enervates, a ſubject:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Wretched man that I am! whither ſhall I turn myſelf? where can I go? to the Capitol? it ſwims with my brother's blood! ſhall I go to to my own houſe? there to ſee my wretched mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſolved in tears, and overwhelmed with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1018102000:15"/>
ſorrow?"</q>
This is a beautiful, bold, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing picture of perplexed grief: mark how faded the tints of originality appear in the following faint copy:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know not where to go, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall turn myſelf, amidſt my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes—the Capitol is the place where my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's blood was ſhed; and at home I ſhall find my unhappy mother lamenting her ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition."</q>
With very narrow comprehenſion and very dull feelings we may readily perceive the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, in this languid extenſion and variation of phraſe.</p>
            <p>We ſhall offer an inſtance of the turgid and chaſte, in the following comparative contraſt. Suppoſe a perſon addreſſing an <hi>Engliſh</hi> audience, on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed decay of <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberty, ſhould thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Moſt renowned <hi>Britons</hi>—in the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous volume of Time we may read—even purblind eyes may ſee the glaring type, that there was a period, when liberty, diaphanous as ſun-beams at noon, exhilarated this oceanic iſle; when like the bird of <hi>Jove</hi> it ſoar'd aloft, and gazed with pleaſure on the face of day; now it faintly glimmers, like the fog-wrapped moon, and our glorious eagle is become a bird of night."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſee how the ſame ſubject may be treated, in oppoſition to this over-charged, bloated, tabernacle harangue; which, delivered in the <hi>Moorfield</hi> manner, muſt prove a laughable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of mirth, to divert common ſenſe, and aſtoniſh ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Fellow citizens, there was a time, when li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty diffuſed its bleſſings thro' this once happy iſle; when its value was known, and its worth revered; when, like the ſun, it was a common

comforter; the parent of pleaſure, eaſe, and ſecurity: now corruption and our own depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity have brought it to ſo enfeebled and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a ſtate, that every real friend of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt tremble, as I do, at the painful idea of its ſpeedy and inevitable diſſolution."</q>
            </p>
            <p>If eloquence (a very dangerous weapon in the hands of ill-deſigning men) is uſed to any other purpoſes than the following, we may conſider it as in a cenſurable ſtate of perverſion.</p>
            <p>It ſhould enforce the cleareſt proof of any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful truth, with ſuch intereſting motives as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the hearers, and work their paſſions to virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes; to raiſe indignation againſt ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; horror againſt cruelty; deteſtation againſt vice; abhorrence againſt ſlavery; compaſſion for miſery; love for virtue; reverence for religion; obedience to ſuperiors; and benevolence to all. Thus employed, eloquence appears in its full force and beauty: mere harangues ſeldom fail to catch the ear, but rarely touch the heart, and as ſeldom inform the head.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary that an orator ſhould call the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his aid; but then he ſhould be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not to impoſe on, or aſſail, them too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the one is cruel, the other impolitic. He ſhould be clear in his ideas, and conciſe in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: he ſhould perfectly underſtand juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of matter, and the proper climax of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: he ſhould be thoroughly poſſeſſed of every principle and part of his ſubject: he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a ſufficient number of appoſite, affecting figures. Thus prepared, he muſt ſpeak, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, from an untrammel'd imagination.</p>
            <p>The following paſſages, from Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s diſcourſe on the Paſtoral Care, ſeems well calculated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1018102000:17"/>
for the improvement of Lay, as well as Pulpit, ſpeakers.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The extempore orator ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently converſe with himſelf, to let his thoughts flow freely from him; eſpecially when he feels an edge and heat upon his mind; for then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py expreſſions will ſpontaneouſly come to his mouth. He muſt alſo write eſſays on all kinds of ſubjects; for, by writing, he will bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a facility and correctneſs of thinking and ſpeaking: and thus, by cloſe application for two or three years, a man may render himſelf ſuch a maſter this way, that he can never be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized; nor will new thoughts ever dry up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. If, in his meditations, happy thoughts and noble pathetic expreſſions offer themſelves, he muſt not loſe, but write them down."</q>
            </p>
            <p>We perfectly agree with the right reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that much oratorical merit may be derived from frequent, well-regulated ſoliloquies, and eſſay-writing; and are induced to offer a few more of his thoughts, though not in the exact words nor confined light wherein he has propoſed them.</p>
            <p>One moſt eſſential point is, that an orator ſhould have a due and deep ſenſe of the truth and utility of his ſubject: he muſt have a life and glow in his thoughts, with relation to it: he ſhould very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly feel in himſelf thoſe things which he explains and recommends to others: he ſhould ſpeak as if what he uttered came from the heart: the orator, unleſs he really is, or ſeems to be, in earneſt, will never make any material impreſſion. There is a degree of authority, even in the ſimpleſt matters that can be treated of, if they appear genuine, while the moſt important points fall into neglect, when conveyed through the cold vehicle of languid expreſſion.</p>

            <p>Mr. RAPIN, in his Reflections upon Eloquence, obſerves, that there are two extremes, which ſhould be equally and carefully avoided; the frigid ſtyle, and the boyiſh. The former renders diſcourſes dry and inſipid, by a languid flatneſs of expreſſion; the latter ungrateful and ſhocking, by a turgid loftineſs, and affected amplification. Thoſe who uſe the frigid ſtyle, call in pompous expreſſions, when the ſubject requires plain ones; and they who affect the boyiſh one, employ low expreſſions in the loftieſt themes. The frigid ſtyle properly includes all ſuch expreſſions as are too ſtrong, or too ſparkling, ſtrained metaphors, and frequent witticiſms: the boyiſh ſtyle comprehends ſtrokes of humour, and quaint conceits, upon ſerious ſubjects; looſe and heavy repetitions, in that part of an oration which ought to be cloſe and conciſe; too violent exaggerations, and too labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious figures.</p>

It requires the fineſt, and moſt ſignificant feelings, in the performer, to create, by ſympathy, proper ſenſations in the audience.</p>
            <p>That noble and almoſt peculiar ſenſe of human nature, Sympathy, makes us not only ſhare in the diſtreſs of a fellow creature, but alſo pity the miſerable brute: it varies ſhapes and ſtrength, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the objects and circumſtances which occur. There are two principal degrees; ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of compulſion and ſympathy of election: the firſt is, when irreſiſtable motives arreſt the heart; the ſecond, when it becomes intereſted, by choice. Compulſive ſympathy inſtructs us to ſigh with ſucceſsleſs love; to kindle with real or well painted rage; to weep with grief; and to mourn for virtue in diſtreſs: elective ſympathy is when we make choice of objects in different ſituations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, without any perſonal knowledge or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate concern, anxious for their ſucceſs: in caſes of competition, whether of a pleaſurable or of a ſerious nature, man cannot remain a ſpectator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally indifferent; he muſt aſſiſt one ſide or the other, with a ſympathetic wiſh: in the choice he is free; yet that choice is frequently ſo capricious, that no firm reaſon can be offered, why it becomes fixed.</p>
            <p>Imagination is the vehicle which conveys ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to, and draws it meliorated from, the heart: that which the Theatre raiſes, is produced by the bold painting of the Poet's pen, aided by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and forcible talents of a good Actor; who is, in every ſentence, an illuſtrative comment upon his author's idea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:1018102000:22"/>This is that kind of ſympathy, which the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Dr. SMITH, in his Theory of Moral Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deſcribes to ariſe from the view of emotions in another perſon: the paſſions may be transfuſed from one perſon to another, inſtantaneouſly, and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the perſon principally concerned. Grief and Joy, ſtrongly expreſſed in the look and geſtures of any one, excluſive of voice, at once affect the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with ſome degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion: a ſmiling face is to every one who ſees it a cheerful object; as a ſorrowful countenance, on the other hand, is a melancholy one.</p>
            <p>What the ingenious Profeſſor ſays of mankind at large, may be brought to the point we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in view. Every faculty in one man, when he judges of propriety, is the meaſure by which he decides upon the like faculty in another: I judge of your ſight, by my ſight; of your ear, by my ear; of your reaſon, by my reaſon; of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, by my reſentment; of your love, by my love: I neither have nor can have any other way of judging, about them. This poſition granted, we are not to wonder at the endleſs variety of, and frequent abſurd critical opinions upon, the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>mimic</hi> ſtages of life.</p>
            <p>If an actor creates ſympathy (which to do ſhould be his foremoſt aim) he will command attention: if not, vain are the beſt requiſites, and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious aids of theatrical decoration.</p>

            <p>By laying the <hi>emphaſis</hi> on <hi>ſpiry,</hi> in the firſt line, the peculiar form of the trees mentioned is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; whereas, had the ſtreſs been laid upon <hi>firs,</hi> it would leave us at liberty to think upon <hi>oaks, elms,</hi> &amp;c. ſpiry too.—The word <hi>ariſe</hi> is marked, as being the purport of a command; and though, in general, the voice falls, at the end of a line, yet, in this caſe, the meaning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it ſhould be raiſed, but not too high, nor abruptly.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond line, <hi>vig'rous</hi> is marked as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the cedar: indeed all <hi>epithets,</hi> whether
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1018102000:25"/>
they precede or follow, require <hi>emphaſis.—Pierce</hi> is noted as painting a quickneſs and boldneſs of vegetation, while the imagination is raiſed to a more than ordinary height, by particulariſing <hi>ſkies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third line, <hi>chill</hi> is diſtinguiſhed as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic quality of the climate of Lebanon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fearleſs,</hi> in the fourth line, is pointed out as an extraordinary attribute of a bird; and <hi>conflicting ſtorms</hi> are emphatical, as a proof of that attribute; enlarging the idea much more than the ſimple word <hi>fearleſs,</hi> unaſſiſted, would have done.</p>
            <p>In the fifth line, <hi>tow'ring</hi> is diſtinguiſhed as an <hi>epithet</hi>; and <hi>cradle,</hi> which happily deſcribes the <hi>ſtork</hi>'s neſt in that rocking ſituation, is pointed out as the motive of the bird's reſolution.</p>
            <p>In the laſt line, <hi>high</hi> is marked as a material cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the imagery, and <hi>ſounding</hi> not only as an <hi>epithet,</hi> but alſo as referring to its turbulent ſituation among whiſtling or roaring gales.</p>
            <p>I have choſen the above ſtanza from the Pſalms, as pictureſque poetry reſts more upon <hi>emphaſis,</hi> than any other ſpecies of writing; and I have been ſo minute in the explanation of it, not only that my meaning might be underſtood, as to this branch of expreſſion, but likewiſe to ſhow that <hi>emphaſis</hi> ſhould be founded on reaſon, not laid merely for a jingle, or variation of ſound.—Having thus marked and explained one ſtanza, I ſhall propoſe two more for the exerciſe of the ſtudent, without any marks of diſtinction.</p>

            <p>After all that can be ſaid, the degrees of <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> are ſo many and ſo variable, that no <hi>preciſe</hi> rules can be laid down for their application.—In <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>declamation,</hi> as in <hi>muſic,</hi> there muſt be taſte, to give beauty; without it mere rectitude will be moſt unaffectingly inſipid. This quality, though improveable, muſt certainly be firſt derived from Nature.—A <hi>reader,</hi> before he can reach bare propriety, muſt thoroughly underſtand what he reads; for which reaſon the cuſtom of putting children to peruſe the Bible, in which there are many difficult words and abſtruſe paſſages, is by no means to be commended; nay, if we conſider it in another light, it is highly blameable; for by being made the ſubject of puzzle and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by being toſſed about in a careleſs and ſlovenly manner, that love and reſpect which the <hi>ſacred writings</hi> juſtly claim, are too frequently ſet aſide in youth<note n="*" place="bottom">This important point is very judiciouſly enforced by Mr. <hi>Hull,</hi> in a note on one of Mr. <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Genuine Letters—
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"He objected to the abſurd cuſtom practiſed then, as at this day, of ſuffering children to <hi>learn to read</hi> from the <hi>Bible</hi>; whence they too often contract a diſtaſte to the moſt edifying and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant volume, that can, in the proceſs of their lives, be laid before them." <bibl>Vol. I.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1018102000:27"/>
Turks, if a piece of written paper appears on the ground, it is taken up and carefully preſerved, leſt the word ALLAH, or GOD, be inſcribed on it.—Mark the contraſted irreverence of Chriſtians! who not only profane with their mouths that moſt aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful name, upon the moſt trivial occaſions, but alſo frequently uſe, as waſte paper, whole ſheets, in which not only his ſacred name is mentioned, but every letter a part of his <hi>divine word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another reaſon againſt making the Bible an early book among learners, is the frequency of periods, and peculiarity of ſtyle, in which it differs widely from moſt other compoſitions. It is not rare to find many perſons, who, by laboriouſly conning over the chapters, can ſtumble their way pretty tolerably through any part of it; yet put them to any other book, you ſhall find them lamentably hampered, and frequently at an abſolute ſtand.</p>
            <p>But to return more particularly to my ſubject.—As no abſolute rules can be laid down for <hi>emphaſis,</hi> in general, we muſt be content with remarks upon particular caſes; ſuch as, that oppoſition, or <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> requires an <hi>emphaſis</hi> upon each of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed words; and that moſt monoſyllables, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a queſtion, muſt be ſtrongly marked: as, <hi>Why</hi> did he ſo? <hi>What</hi> can he mean? <hi>How</hi> did ſhe look? In compound words, that are oppoſed to others, the <hi>emphaſis,</hi> or rather <hi>accent,</hi> properly falls on the diſtinguiſhing ſyllables: for inſtance, The <hi>virtuous</hi> are <hi>modeſt</hi>—the <hi>vicious immodeſt</hi>—the <hi>righteous</hi> are <hi>bleſſed</hi>—the <hi>unrighteous</hi> are <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</hi>—Here I have oppoſed ſimple to ſimple, and compound to compound; were the words <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> to be pronounced without oppoſition, the accent would fall upon the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſyllable, inſtead of the <hi>firſt.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1018102000:28"/>In <hi>explanatory emphaſes</hi> the very ſame words are differently marked, according to the writer's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: as, What did my maſter ſay? If I lay the ſtreſs upon <hi>what,</hi> it is a general interrogation; if I place it upon <hi>my,</hi> it implies that other maſters were concerned; if <hi>maſter</hi> is diſtinguiſhed, it notes that there were other perſons; and if the <hi>emphaſis</hi> lies boldeſt upon <hi>ſay,</hi> it ſhows I want to know his particular words.</p>
            <p>Both the cauſe and the effect in any ſentence require an <hi>emphaſis.</hi>—Example: To <hi>live</hi> WELL, is to <hi>die</hi> HAPPY—only to be GOOD, is to be GREAT—GUILT is the ſource of SORROW.</p>
            <p>CLIMAX is that progreſſive force and exaltation of expreſſion, which more powerfully impreſſes each ſubject on the mind; and is not only of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible uſe, but alſo highly ornamental. In the execution of this, there is much nicety, as the riſe, in moſt caſes, ſhould be gradual, always har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, and upon many occaſions very forcible.—To illuſtrate the matter, I ſhall offer ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of different degrees of <hi>climax.</hi> Firſt from Shakeſpeare's Brutus; which ſhould riſe with a full, ſmooth, philoſophic weight and dignity.</p>

               <l>Which ends this ſtrange eventful hiſtory,</l>

            <p>Every <hi>emphaſis</hi> and variation of voice ſhould be founded on reaſon; it may be proper, therefore, to ſhow why the ſeveral parts of the preceding lines are thus diſtinguiſhed. In the firſt age of infancy, the upper notes are moſt deſcriptive of that tender time, as they are alſo of the whimpering ſchool-boy; and their ſoftneſs likewiſe ſuits the ſighing of the lover. The forward confidence of the ſoldier demands a full-ſpirited medium; and the corpulent importance, generally imputed to magiſtracy, is well pictured by the jolly ſwell of the <hi>baſe</hi> notes, while the feebleneſs of faſt declining age calls for the <hi>counter-tenor,</hi> tremulated, as it were, with weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus much for general explanation, which I have delivered in as full and clear a manner as the nature of my deſign would poſſibly admit; and, having ſet forth ſuch examples as, explained by <hi>teachers,</hi> or carefully inveſtigated by <hi>ſtudents,</hi> may give a full idea of what is intended, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome brief remarks upon <hi>utterance</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1018102000:49"/>
               <hi>action,</hi> in which, though it is not probable that many will excel, yet moſt may be improved.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, if a voice is naturally harſh, great care ſhould be taken to avoid guttural expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; nor ſhould the tongue be allowed to play too much between the teeth; the breath, drawn, as it were, from the ſtomach, and vibrated upon <hi>within</hi> the mouth, will ſoften harſh notes, and render them much more tuneable; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a weak ſhrill voice ſhould borrow ſolidity and force from the throat: as too great an expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the lips is diſgraceful to the features, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural contraction of them will render expreſſion unmeaning and imperfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stops</hi> and <hi>cadences</hi> are a moſt eſſential point of conſideration, and cannot be better ſet forth than in the following remarks of a French author:
<q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'It is neceſſary for us,'
ſays he,
'to reſpire from time to time, but the voice does not repoſe equally at the concluſion of every ſenſe; in a ſentence of conſiderable length, we reſpire at every <hi>comma</hi>; but this ſhort pauſe is made in ſuch a manner as to ſhow, by the tone of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, that we are to go farther, the ear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining unſatisfied, becauſe the pronunciation continues ſuſpended till the ſentence is completely finiſhed; as for example: <hi>At ſuch a time, the King, having taken theſe matters into conſideration, determined,</hi> here Attention is inquiſitive to know what follows; the <hi>colon</hi> and <hi>ſemicolon</hi> are marks of more conſiderable reſpiration, yet ſtill leave Judgment in ſuſpence till the period unfolds the whole, and calls for a concluding cadence.<p>'In every part, or parts of a ſentence there is elevation and depreſſion of the voice, which never abſolutely repoſes but at the concluſion of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1018102000:50"/>
a period, all other reſpiration being of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.'</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There is undoubtedly much judgment in the compoſition of harmonious and comprehenſive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; a diſſonant unconnected ſtyle will take greatly from the beauty and force of expreſſion, as a diſcordant piece of muſic muſt diſgrace a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ableſt maſter, and injure the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the moſt perfect inſtruments.</p>
            <p>Frequent uſe ſtrengthens and meliorates the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of expreſſion, and practice will teach a moſt eſſential point, that of pitching the voice to any place or number of perſons. There is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nicety in knowing the different effect which the ſame notes of voice may have in places of equal dimenſions, but of different conſtruction, of a place containing but few auditors, or thronged with a large number; and this point of excellence muſt be attained by much practice and obſervation. Only thus much may be obſerved in general of the operations of ſound; that where it undulates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, the louder a <hi>reader</hi> or <hi>declaimer</hi> goes beyond the juſt pitch, the more indiſtinct he will be, of which we find very frequent inſtances in <hi>cathedral</hi> churches: a full audience in any place will require at leaſt twice the force of expreſſion of a thin one; which, excluſive of ſome buzz that muſt unavoidably attend a numerous aſſembly, may be philoſophically accounted for by an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial denſity of air, from the conjunct reſpiration of ſo many people.</p>
            <p>The voice being pitched, and modulated thro' the ſeveral variations which may be found neceſſary, it remains to conſider, to comprehend, and to feel the ſubject; without which expreſſion muſt be languid, unaffecting, and weariſome. What we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1018102000:51"/>
               <hi>read</hi> or <hi>ſpeak</hi> unfelt, muſt be like painting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light or ſhade; there may be juſt ſymmetry of parts and good colouring; but unleſs they are raiſed and brought forward, both pall on the view, and die upon the canvaſs.</p>
            <p>Spirit and feeling are neceſſary to idea as well as to ſight; for which reaſon <hi>teachers</hi> ſhould not only make their <hi>pupils</hi> underſtand every word they <hi>read,</hi> but their general ſenſe in a ſtate of connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a point of care ſeldom attended to.</p>
            <p>Emphatic expreſſion, feeling, and taſte, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly eſſential to poetry, as that, in general, appeals oftner to the paſſions than any other ſpecies of writing. <hi>Cadences</hi> alſo are more critical in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers than in proſe; in both they ſhould be ſmooth, gradual, and die away almoſt inſenſibly, yet ſo as to preſerve and to impreſs the laſt ſyllable both upon the ear and mind, without ſnapping ſhort the breath or ſound, which is extremely grating to a judicious hearer.</p>
            <p>How often is verſe of every kind miſerably mangled! A ſort of unmeaning pedantic recitative, tedious from a repetition of miſplaced unharmonious tones, is ſubſtituted for dignity; thus we find many, who make a tolerable ſhift with proſe, the moment they ſee any number of meaſured ſyllables, throw aſide nature, reaſon, nay even common ſenſe, to diſplay their knowledge of verſification, and what they think its peculiar importance.—What can be more abſurd? Genuine poetry needs no pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous affectation to dignify it; for as by tranſpoſing the words you cannot reduce it to proſe, neither can you take from its harmony by plain, natural expreſſion.</p>
            <p>I know not any thing which has done our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the reading of it, more injury than the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1018102000:52"/>
gingle of rhime, eſpecially that which is thrown into heroic meaſure, it being certain that the more correct an author in that way is, the more he will lead to monotony. Inſtance Mr. Pope, who has been ſo critically exact in accenting particular ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, that very few of his pieces can be read with any tolerable variation of voice; for which reaſon I would have learners kept from rhime in heroic meaſure till they are well grounded in a juſt mode of utterance. Indeed we are not to wonder that the <hi>generality</hi> chaunt verſe in ſo lamentable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when ſome of thoſe who have ſketched rules for reading, inſiſt upon ſuch a ſervile obedience to the author, as not only to change the accented ſyllable, but even to favour his bad rhime, with falſe pronunciation; for example, to ſound the laſt ſyllable of <hi>liberty,</hi> as an exact <hi>rhime</hi> either to <hi>flee</hi> or <hi>fly.</hi>—To preſcribe a ſtop or half pauſe at the end of a line, whether the ſenſe requires it or not, is another rule that has been given, equally erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and diſguſtful.</p>
            <p>In <hi>reading,</hi> properly ſo called, <hi>action</hi> has no concern, but <hi>declamation</hi> is very defective without it; yet, except upon the <hi>ſtage,</hi> and among many there miſerably methodized, we ſcarce find any.—When I recommend <hi>action,</hi> I would not be ſuppoſed to intend that a ſpeaker ſhould be in continual motion; or that, puppet-like, he is to lift up firſt one hand and then another, merely to lay them down again.—No—I would have motions few, eaſy, graceful; and, for my own part, I know not how a declaimer can poſſibly feel and ſtand ſtock-ſtill: but, admit the poſſibility of this, I will venture to ſay there is but little probability that his audience will think him in earneſt: I know that ſome delicate perſons are afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1018102000:53"/>
too <hi>theatrical</hi>; but there is a very wide difference between the <hi>action</hi> of an <hi>orator</hi> and an <hi>actor,</hi> unleſs when the latter judiciouſly repreſents the former; but I ſhall no further urge the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a point ſo obvious, let us proceed to the thing itſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, <hi>action</hi> ſhould be entirely reſerved for thoſe paſſages which contain ſomewhat inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting or important, as demonſtration, or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing of a charge. This ſhould be attended with the right arm ſtretched forward to the full extent, the fingers even, and the palm of the hand downwards, or ſometimes the hand turned ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, the fore finger only pointing: if the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance demonſtrated, or given in charge, be very momentous, the well known and admired action of St. Paul preaching at Athens, ſtretching forth both arms, palms downwards, has much force and propriety.</p>
            <p>Where <hi>grief</hi> is to be expreſſed, the right hand laid ſlowly to the left breaſt, the head and cheſt bending forward, is a juſt indication of it. To expreſs <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>reſolution,</hi> the ſame hand muſt move to the ſame place, but with quickneſs and vigour, recoiling as it were from the heart, which thereby ſeems to meet it. With this action the head ſhould be thrown back and the cheſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The expreſſion of <hi>ardent affection,</hi> is to cloſe both hands warmly at half arm's length, the fingers intermingling, and to bring them to the breaſt with ſpirit. If <hi>expanſion</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> or any thing ſimilar, is to be pointed out, then both arms ſhould be caſt different ways, in a parallel line, and the cheſt thrown open. Folding arms, with a drooping of the head, deſcribe contemplation; erection of the head ſpeaks dignity, or, with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1018102000:54"/>
features, contempt. There are ſome few other inſtances of action which may be graceful, and ſerves for variation, though not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but theſe muſt be left to the choice and diſcretion of the declaimer, and to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained operation of judicious feeling: only thus much it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that the left hand ſhould ſeldom or never be uſed by itſelf; and that all action ſhould move between the tip of the ſhoulder and the ſeat of the heart; all above is what Shakeſpeare juſtly ſtyles ſawing the air; all below both unmeaning and ungraceful. Upon the whole, every motion ſhould be the natural attendant of what is ſpoken: if an extreme cannot be avoided, I would rather recommend <hi>no</hi> action than <hi>too much,</hi> or than ſuch as muſt offend judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eyes.—<hi>Attitudes,</hi> or poſitions of the body, when happily ſtruck off and well applied, are not only pictureſque but ſtriking, all deſcription of them with a pen muſt be faint and confuſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we refer to the pencil of ſome able painter.</p>
            <p>To what has been already offer'd we ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join ſome uſeful remarks from an ingenious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on the Art of Speaking.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <p>"If nature, unaſſiſted, could form the eminent ſpeaker, where were the uſe of art and culture? which no one pretends to queſtion: art is but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture improved upon and refined; and before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is applied, genius is but a maſs of ore in the mine, without luſtre and without value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unknown and unthought of: the ancients uſed to procure maſters for pronunciation from the theatres, and had youth taught geſture and attitude, by the Palaeſtritae, who taught much the ſame among them, as dancing-maſters do among us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1018102000:55"/>"It is well when a youth has no natural impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or defect in his ſpecch; and I ſhould by no means adviſe that he who has, be brought up to any profeſſion requiring elocution; yet there are inſtances of natural defects ſurmounted; and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſpeakers formed by indefatigable diligence in ſpite of them; DEMOSTHENES when he began to ſtudy rhetoric, could not pronounce the firſt letter of the name of that art; and CICERO was long-necked and narrow cheſted; but diligent labour, in what we are earneſt upon, ſurmounts all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that are not too deeply rooted in nature: for want of proper application we are frequently diſguſted by public ſpeakers liſping, ſtammering, and ſpeaking thro' the noſe; pronouncing the letter k with the throat, inſtead of the tongue, s like th, and ſcreaming above, or croaking below all natural pitch of human voice.</p>
                  <p>Some unexperienced attempters at oratory mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as if they were conjuring up ſpirits; others bawl as loud as ſtreet hawkers; ſome ſo precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in expreſſion that no ear can diſtinguiſh; others drag words like the heavy pauſes of a great clock ſtriking; ſome have got a diſagreeable habit of ſhrugging up their ſhoulders; others of ſee-ſawing their bodies backwards and forwards, or from ſide to ſide; ſome open their mouths frightfully, others keep their teeth ſo cloſe as if the jaws were ſet; all which, with many other bad, diſgraceful habits, ſhould either be got the better of in early life, or the young perſons put into ſome other path than that of public ſpeaking: neglect of this, occaſions ſuch confirmation of deficiency, that not one ſpeaker in twenty knows what to do with his hands, voice, or eyes.</p>
