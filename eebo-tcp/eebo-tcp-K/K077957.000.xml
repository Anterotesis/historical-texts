            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Why, you muſt know, Madam, my Maſter had the Misfortune to quarrel with a Gentleman, who urg'd him to fight; my Maſter kill'd him: Upon which he was forc'd to change his Habit and his Name—From <hi>Cuningham</hi> to <hi>Boutefeu.</hi> But think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not ſafe to ſtay here, fled; and in his Journey happen'd into a Viſcount's Caſtle, but the Viſcount was gone a Journey. However, this Viſcount had a very beautiful Siſter, that had the Command in her Brother's Abſence; ſhe entertain'd my Maſter very ſplendidly: At laſt he fell in love with her, and ſhe with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Widow.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks ſhe was very forward, <hi>Jeffrey.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>She was ſo indeed, Madam; for before my Maſter left her, ſhe prov'd with Child.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Widow.</speaker>
               <p>How! with Child, and not married, <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey!</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>My Maſter had promis'd her Marriage, Madam.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Widow.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, the impudent Creature! And thy Maſter was to blame, not to keep his Word, <hi>Jeffrey.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all, Madam, when you have heard all. You muſt know, my Maſter grew jealous of one of the Servants, as indeed he had Reaſon: And one Day pretended to ride out, and he ſhou'd not return that Night, but left me to let him in, when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were all a-bed, which I did. Going up to this Lady's Bed-Chamber, and not being expected that Night, found the Servant in Bed with her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Widow.</speaker>
               <p>Unheard of Impudence!</p>
               <p>At firſt I was going to condemn thy Maſter, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a young Creature; but 'tis likely he was not the firſt, that had to do with her.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>Very likely ſo, Madam. Next Day my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was for packing up his Awls, and for going; ſhe cry'd, and urg'd his ſtay, and his Vows to marry her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Widow.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jeff.</speaker>
               <p>In the mean time the Viſcount return'd, found his Siſter in Tears, wou'd know the Reaſon, was told all. He ſwore, if ever he could get hold of him, he'd hang him at his Caſtle Gate, but my Maſter was got off ſafe. What it will come to, it they ſhould ever meet, I know not, but fear the Event.</p>
