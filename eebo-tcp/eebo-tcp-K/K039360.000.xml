            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I preſumed to ſolicit the honour of laying the ſubſequent trifle at your Royal Highneſs's feet; it was not without a thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the little value of the offering I was going to make; but I conſidered, mean as it was, it would ſerve as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my devotion; and to a Prince happy in a love of the arts, nothing could be unacceptable, which bore the remoteſt analogy to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0537101000:3"/>How far the Comic Opera, under proper regulations, has a right to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a junior offspring of the Drama, and as ſuch become candidate for a ſhare of public encouragement, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine; but if it can be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an agreeable amuſement, the Engliſh Theatre has never ſcrupled to adopt, what was capable of pleaſing there; and though as a work of genius, it is by no means to be ſet in competition with good Tragedies and Comedies, it may, I apprehend, be permitted as an occaſional relief to them, without bringing either our taſte or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding into queſtion.</p>
            <p>I need not inform your Royal Highneſs, that in France, where the ſtage has been cultivated with more care, and ſucceſs, than in any other country; this ſpecies of entertainment is received with very great applauſe; nor is it thought any injury to Corneille, and Moliere, that the pieces of Anſeaume and Favart, meet with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0537101000:4"/>It is true, among the French, Comic Operas have very often the advantage of being extremely well written; of which, On ne S'aviſe jamais de tout, Le Roy, et le Fermier, and ſome others are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; nor would the beſt compoſition of the greateſt maſter, make a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible poem paſs on an audience: I wiſh I could aſſert with truth, that in this reſpect, we fall nothing behind our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and that what I here preſent to your Royal Highneſs, might lay claim to ſome degree of merit, even in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but though I cannot do this, permit me to ſay, I have attempted to render it a little intereſting, and not wholly undivert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as far as the muſic, my principal care, would give me leave.</p>
            <p>But I humbly beg your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's pardon; in applying to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur, I forget that I am at the ſame time addreſſing a Great Prince: indeed, there is a ſubject, on which I could dwell with the trueſt pleaſure; but I

am too well inſtructed in your Royal Highneſs's character, to dare to offend you, with a language, which forms and cuſtom, too often impoſe upon princes, a neceſſity of hearing; I mean their own praiſe; to thoſe who are moſt deſerving, ever leaſt welcome.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE is ſcarce a language in Europe, in which there is not a play taken from our romance of Pamela; in Italian and French, particularly, ſeveral writers of the firſt eminence, have choſen it for the ſubject of different dramas.</p>
            <p>The little piece now ventured into the world, owes its origin to the ſame ſource, not only the general ſubject is drawn from Pamela, but almoſt every circumſtance in it. The reader will immediately recollect —the courtſhip of Parſon Williams—the Squire's jealouſy and behaviour in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, and the difficulty he had to prevail with himſelf to marry the girl, notwithſtanding his paſſion for her—the miller is a cloſe copy of Goodman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0537101000:7"/>
—Ralph is imagined, from the wild ſon which he is mentioned to have had— Theodoſia, from the young lady of quality, with whom Mr. B. through his ſiſter's perſuaſion, is ſaid to have been in treaty before his marriage with Pamela—even the gipſies, are borrowed from a trifling incident in the latter part of the work.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this plan, which he has varied from the original, as far as he thought convenient, the author has made ſimplicity his principal aim. His ſcenes, on account of the muſic, which could not be perfect without ſuch a mixture, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conſiſt of ſerious and buffoon. He knows groſſneſs and inſipidity lay in his way; whether he has had art enough to avoid ſtumbling upon them, the candid Public is left to determine.</p>

                  <p>Well Patty, Maſter Goodman my lord's ſteward has been with me juſt now, and I find we are like to have great doings, his lordſhip has brought down ſir Harry Sycamore, and his family; and there is more company expected in a few days.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>I know ſir Harry very well, he is by marriage a diſtant relation of my lord's.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray what ſort of a young body is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there? I think ſhe us'd to be with you at the caſtle, three or four ſummers ago, when my young lord was out upon his travels.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh very often, ſhe was a great favourite of my lady's; pray father is ſhe come down?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Why you know the report laſt night, about my lord's going to be married; by what I can learn ſhe is, and there is likely to be a nearer relationſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0537101000:14"/>
the families, e're long. It ſeems, his lordſhip was not over willing for the match, but the friends on both ſides in London preſſed it ſo hard: then there's a ſwinging fortune, maſter Goodman tells me, a matter of twenty or thirty thouſand pounds!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>If it was a million, father, it would not be more than my lord Aimworth deſerves; I ſuppoſe the wedding will be celebrated here, at the manſion-houſe?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>So it is thought, as ſoon as things can be properly prepared—And now, Patty, if I could but ſee thee a little merry—Come, bleſs thee, pluck up thy ſpirits—To be ſure thou has ſuſtained, in the death of thy lady, a heavy loſs; ſhe was a parent to thee, nay, and better, inaſmuch as ſhe took thee when thou wert but a babe, and gave thee an education which thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parents could not afford to do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah! dear father, don't mention, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, has been my greateſt misfortune.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay then, Patty, what's become of all thy ſenſe, that people talk ſo much about? —But I have ſomething to ſay to thee which I would have thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly.—I believe I need not tell thee, my child, that a young maiden, after ſhe is marriageable, eſpecially if ſhe has any thing about her to draw people's notice, is liable to ill tongues, and a many croſs accidents; ſo that the ſooner ſhe is out of harm's way the better.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>Undoubtedly, father, there are people enough who watch every opportunity to gratify their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; but when a young woman's conduct is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Patty, there may be ſomething in that; but you know ſlander will leave ſpots where malice finds none: I ſay, then, a young woman's beſt ſafeguard is a good huſband. Now there is our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, farmer Giles; he is a ſober, honeſt, induſtrious young fellow, and one of the wealthieſt in theſe parts; he is greatly taken with thee; and it is not the firſt time I have told thee I ſhould be glad to have him for a ſon-in-law.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Why that's ſpoken like a dutiful, ſenſible girl; get thee in, then, and leave me to manage it— Perhaps our neighbour Giles is not a gentleman; but what are the greateſt part of our country gentlemen good for?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>Very true, father. The ſentiments, indeed, have frequently little correſpondence with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is according to them alone we ought to regulate our eſteem.</p>

                  <p>And I promiſe thee my daughter will make thee a choice wife.—But there is one thing to be conſidered.—Thou know'ſt, friend Giles, that I, and all belongs to me, have great obligations to lord Aimworth's family; Patty, in particular, would be one of the moſt ungrateful wretches this day breathing, if ſhe was to do the ſmalleſt thing contrary to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and approbation.—I need not tell thee what ſhe owes them.</p>

                  <p>Well, maſter Giles, I'll aſſure thee ſhe is not one whit leſs obliged to my lord himſelf.—When his mother was taken off ſo ſuddenly, and his affairs called him up to London, if Patty would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at the caſtle, ſhe might have had the command of all; or if ſhe would have gone any where elſe, he would have paid for her fixing, let the coſt be what it would.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Giles.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, for that matter, folks did not ſpare to ſay, that my lord had a kind of a ſneaking kindneſs for her himſelf: and I remember, at one time, it was riſe all about the neighbourhood, that ſhe was actually to be our lady.</p>

                  <p>Pardon me papa, it is not I am unreaſonable; when I gave way to my inclinations for Mr. Mervin, he did not ſeem leſs agreeable to you and my mama, than he was acceptable to me.

                  <p>And yet papa, what elſe can I call it? for though lord Aimworth is extremely attentive, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, I aſſure you he is by no means one of the moſt ardent of lovers.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>

                  <p>Well, but Doſſy, don't you ſee how your mama loves me; if my finger does but ach, ſhe's like a bewitched woman; and if I was to die, I don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe wou'd outlive the burying of me: nay ſhe has told me as much herſelf.</p>

                  <p>Well but Madam, be their quality ever ſo great, I can't ſee what right my lord John, and my lord Thomas, have to direct my inclinations; and I muſt tell you there is a much nearer relation of mine, and one who has a better right to rule me, that is my father, who has a great regard for Mr. Mervin, and would conſent to our union with all his heart.</p>

                  <p>Upon my word farmer, you have made an excellent choice—It is a god-daughter of my mother's Madam, who was bred up under her care, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt I do not know a more amiable young woman— but are you ſure farmer, that Patty herſelf is inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this match?</p>

                  <p>Why as far as this here, my lord; to be ſure, the miller did not care to publiſh the banns, without making your lordſhip acquainted — But I hope your honor's not angry with I.</p>

                  <p>This worthy baronet, and his lady, are certainly a very whimſical couple, however, their daughter is perfectly amiable in every reſpect; and yet I am ſorry I have brought her down here; for can I in honour marry her, while my affections are engaged to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? To what does the pride of condition and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the world force me! Muſt I then renounce the only perſon that can make me happy; becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what? becauſe ſhe's a miller's daughter. Vain pride and unjuſt cenſure: has ſhe not all the graces that education can give her ſex, improved by a genius ſeldom found among the higheſt? Has ſhe not modeſty, ſweetneſs of temper, and beauty of perſon, capable of adorning a rank the moſt exalted? But it is too late to think of theſe things now; my hand is promiſed, my honour engaged; and if it was not ſo, ſhe has engaged herſelf, the farmer is a perſon to her mind, and I have authoriſed their union by my approbation.</p>

                  <p>I humbly beg pardon my lord, for preſſing ſo abruptly into your preſence; but I was told I might walk this way; and I am come by my father's commands, to thank your lordſhip for all your favours.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Favours Patty! what favours? I have done you none; but why this metamorphoſis? I proteſt if you had not ſpoke, I ſhould not have known you; I never ſaw you wear ſuch cloaths as theſe in my mother's life time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>No my lord, it was her ladyſhip's pleaſure I ſhould wear better, and therefore I obey'd; but it is now my duty to dreſs in a manner more ſuitable to my ſtation, and future proſpects in life.</p>

                  <p>Well, and don't you think you could have made a better choice than farmer Giles? I ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine your perſon, your accompliſhments, might have intitled you to look higher.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>Your lordſhip is pleaſed to over-rate my little merit; the education I received in your family, does not intitle me to forget my origin; and the farmer is my equal.</p>

                  <p>In what reſpect? the degrees of rank and fortune, my dear Patty, are arbitrary diſtinctions, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the regard of thoſe who conſider juſtly; the true

                  <p>The farmer my lord, is a very honeſt man.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>So he may, I don't ſuppoſe he would break into a houſe, or commit a robbery on the highway; what do you tell me of his honeſty for?</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Offend! I am not offended Patty, not at all offended—but is there any great merit in a man's being honeſt?</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>The farmer is an ill bred illiterate booby, and what happineſs can you propoſe to yourſelf in ſuch a ſociety. Then as to his perſon I am ſure—But perhaps Patty you like him, and if ſo I am doing a wrong thing.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay I ſee you do, he has had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to pleaſe you, and in that caſe you are certainly in the right to follow your inclinations—I muſt tell you one thing Patty, however—I hope you won't think it unfriendly of me—But I am determined farmer Giles ſhall not ſtay a moment on my eſtate, after next quarter day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Patty.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope my lord, he has not incurred your diſpleaſure—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>That's of no ſignification—Could I find as many good qualities in him as you do, perhaps—but 'tis enough, he's a fellow I don't like; and as you have a regard for him, I would have you adviſe him to provide himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Why I was thinking, if ſo be as you would come down, as we might take a dance together; little Sal, farmer Harrow's daughter of the Green, would fain have had me for a partner, but I ſaid as how I'd go for one I liked better, one that I'd make a partner for life.</p>

                  <p>Thank you Miller, there's no occaſion for either—I only want to ſpeak a few words to you, and have company waiting for me without.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>No Miller, let them ſtay where they are— I find you are about marrying your daughter—I know the great regard my mother had for her, and am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that nothing but her ſudden death, could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her leaving her a handſome proviſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear my lord, your noble mother, you, and all your family, have heap'd favours on favours, on my poor child.</p>

                  <p>Whatever has been done for her ſhe has fully merited—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Why to be ſure, my lord, ſhe is a very good girl.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Poor old man—but thoſe are tears of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction—here maſter Fairfield, to bring matters to a ſhort concluſion, here is a bill of a thouſand pounds.— Portion your daughter with what you think convenient of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf</speaker>
                  <p>A thouſand pound my lord! pray excuſe me; excuſe me worthy ſir, too much has been done already, and we have no pretenſions.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>I inſiſt upon your taking it—Put it up and ſay no more.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fairf.</speaker>
                  <p>Well my lord, if it muſt be ſo; but indeed, indeed —</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>In this I only fullfil what I am ſatisfied would pleaſe my mother. As to myſelf, I ſhall take
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0537101000:56"/>
upon me all the expences of Patty's wedding, and have already given orders about it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>Alas Sir, you are too good, too generous; but I fear we ſhall not be able to profit of your kind intentions, unleſs you will condeſcend to ſpeak a little to Patty.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>Why my lord, I thought we had pretty well ordered all things concerning this marriage, but all on a ſudden, the girl has taken it into her head, not to have the farmer, and declares ſhe will never marry at all—but I know my lord, ſhe'll pay great reſpect to any thing you ſay; and if you'll but lay your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on her to marry him, I am ſure ſhe'll do it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, pray my lord do; I'll ſend her into you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Maſter Fairfield!
<stage>(Fairfield goes out and returns)</stage>
What can be the meaning of this? refuſe to marry the farmer! How, why? My heart is thrown in an agitation, while every ſtep I take ſerves but to lead me into new perplexities.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                  <p>She's coming, my lord, I ſaid you were here; and I humbly beg you will tell her, you inſiſt upon the match going forward; tell her you inſiſt upon it my lord, and ſpeak a little angrily to her.</p>

                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>Yet another conflict! well, 'tis the laſt, and I muſt go through it.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>I came hither, Patty, in conſequence of our converſation this morning, to render your change of ſtate as agreeable and happy as I could; but your father tells me, you have fallen out with the farmer; has any thing happened ſince I ſaw you laſt, to alter your good opinion of him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>No my lord, I am in the ſame opinion with regard to the farmer now, that I always was.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought, Patty, you loved him, you told me?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>My lord!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, no matter—It ſeems I have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in that particular—Poſſibly your affections are engaged elſewhere; let me but know the man that can make you happy, and I ſwear—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, my lord, you take too much trouble upon my account.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps Patty, you love ſomebody ſo much beneath you, you are aſhamed to own it; but your eſteem confers a value whereſoever it is placed—I was too harſh with you this morning; our inclinations are not in our own power; they maſter the wiſeſt of us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray, pray my lord, talk not to me in this ſtile; conſider me as one deſtined by birth and fortune to the meaneſt condition and offices; who has unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily been too apt to imbibe ſentiments contrary to them; let me conquer a heart where pride and vanity have uſurped an improper rule, and learn to know my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of whom I have been too long ignorant.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps, Patty, you love ſome one ſo much above you, you are afraid to own it.—If ſo, be his rank what it will, he is to be envied; for the love of a woman of virtue, beauty, and ſentiment, does
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0537101000:58"/>
honour to a monarch — What means that downcaſt look, thoſe tears, thoſe bluſhes? Dare you not confide in me—Do you think Patty, you have a friend in the world would ſympathize with you more ſincerely than I.</p>

                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſhall I anſwer? No my lord, you have ever treated me with a kindneſs, a generoſity of which none but minds like your's are capable; you have been my inſtructor, my adviſer; my protector: but, my lord, you have been too good; when our ſuperiors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the diſtance between us, we are ſometimes led to forget it too; had you been leſs condeſcending, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I had been happier.</p>

                  <p>And have I, Patty, have I made you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; I, who would ſacrifice my own felicity to ſecure yours?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>I beg my lord, you will ſuffer me to be gone; only believe me ſenſible of all your favours, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the ſmalleſt.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>How unworthy! you merit every thing, my reſpect, my eſteem, my friendſhip, and my love! yes I repeat, I avow it; your beauty, your modeſty, your underſtanding, has made a conqueſt of my heart; but what a world do we live in? that while I own this, while I own a paſſion for you, founded on the juſteſt, the nobleſt baſis; I muſt at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the fear of that world, its taunts, its reproaches—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah Sir, think better of the creature you have raiſed, than to ſuppoſe I ever entertained a hope tending to your diſhonour: would that be a return for the favours I have received? would that be a grateful reverence for the memory of her—pity and pardon the diſturbance of a mind that fears to enquire too minutely into its own ſenſations—I am unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate my lord, but not criminal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>Patty, we are both unfortunate; for my own part, I know not what to ſay to you, or what to propoſe to myſelf.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Pat.</speaker>
                  <p>Then my lord, 'tis mine to act as I ought: yet while I am honoured with a place in your eſteem,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0537101000:59"/>
imagine me not inſenſible of ſo high a diſtinction, or capable of lightly turning my thoughts towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>My lord, I am convinced it is for your credit and my ſafety, it ſhould be ſo; I hope I have not ſo ill profited by the leſſons of your noble mother, but I ſhall be able to do my duty wherever I am call'd to it; this will be my firſt ſupport, time and reflection will compleat the work.</p>

                  <p>Really my lord I don't know; I ſaw her go into the garden about a quarter of an hour ago, from our chamber window.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Into the garden! perhaps ſhe has got an inkling of our being informed of this affair; and is gone to throw herſelf into the pond. Deſpair, my lord, makes girls do terrible things. 'Twas but the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday before we left London, that I ſaw, taken out of Roſamond's pond in Saint James's Park, as likely a young woman as ever you would deſire to ſet your eyes on; in a new calamancoe petticoat, and a pair of ſilver buckles in her ſhoes.</p>

                  <p>Don't mention it, madam; the fault has been mine; who have been innocently the occaſion of a young lady's tranſgreſſing a point of duty and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, which, otherwiſe, ſhe would never have violated.

                  <p>Well maſter Fairfield, I will not preſs on you a donation, the rejection of which does you ſo much credit; you may take my word, however, that your fears upon this occaſion are entirely groundleſs; but this is not enough, as I have been the means of loſing your daughter one huſband, it is but juſt I ſhould get her another; and, ſince the farmer is ſo ſcrupulous, there is a young man in the houſe here, whom I have ſome influence over, and I dare ſay, he will be leſs ſqueamiſh.</p>

                  <p>Go then, immediately, and bring Patty hither; I ſhall not be eaſy till I have given you entire ſatisfaction. But, ſtay and take a letter, which I am ſtepping into my ſtudy to write; I'll order a chaiſe to be got ready, that you may go back and forward with greater expedition.</p>

                  <p>Well, and now you may go and wait at the fore door, if you like it; but I forewarn you and your gang, not to keep lurking about our mill any longer, for if you do, I'll ſend the conſtable after you, and have you every mother's ſkin clapt in the county gaol; you are ſuch a pack of thieves, one can't hang ſo much as a rag to dry for you; it was but the other day that a couple of them came into our kitchen to beg a handful of dirty flour to make them cakes, and before the wench could turn about, they had whipped off three braſs candleſticks and a potlid.</p>

                  <p>I know very well the ridicule that may be thrown on a lord's marrying a miller's daughter; and I own with bluſhes, it has for ſome time had too great weight with me; but we ſhould marry to pleaſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not other people: and on mature conſideration, I can ſee no reproach juſtly merited, by raiſing a deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman to a ſtation ſhe is capable of adorning, let her birth be what it will.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Har.</speaker>
                  <p>Why 'tis very true my lord: I once knew a gentleman that married his cook maid; he was a relation of my own—you remember fat Margery, my lady! She was a very good ſort of a woman, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe was, and made the beſt ſuet dumplings that ever I taſted.</p>

                  <p>Will you never learn, Sir Harry, to guard your expreſſions—Well, but give me leave my lord to ſay a word to you—there are other ill conſequences attending ſuch an alliance.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Aim.</speaker>
                  <p>One of them I ſuppoſe is, that I, a peer, ſhould be obliged to call this good old miller, father-in-law; but where's the ſhame in that? he is as good as any lord, in being a man; and if we dare ſuppoſe a lord that is not an honeſt man, he is, in my opinion, the more reſpectable character. Come maſter Fairfield, give me your hand, from henceforth you have done with working; we will pull down your mill, and build you a houſe in the place of it; and the money I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the portion of your daughter, ſhall now be laid out in purchaſing a commiſſion for your ſon.</p>
