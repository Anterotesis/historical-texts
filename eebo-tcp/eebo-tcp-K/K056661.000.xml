            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ESSAY
ON THE
SOUTH-SEA
TRADE.</head>
            <p>A NEW Trade being now to be ſet on
Foot, and in a New Manner, with a
Capital Stock, and by the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Government, it has been
long expected when ſome Able Pen would have
undertaken to guide the People of this unſettled
Age how to think about it.</p>
            <p>There has not been in our Memory an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of ſuch Conſequence, and ſo generally to
be engaged in; nor has there been an Undertaking,
about which the People, even thoſe who are to
be concern'd have been ſo uneaſie, their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it ſo confuſed, and their Knowledge of the
Manner and Circumſtances of it ſo ſmall.</p>
            <p>There has not been an Undertaking in this Age
introduced in ſuch a Method, againſt which ſo
many People, upon ſo differing Foundations, are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0164202400:4"/>
pleaſed (perhaps ſome of them hardly knowing
why) to oppoſe themſelves: Before it was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it had the general Suffrage of all Mankind,
every Man talk'd of it as a Thing fit to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
worthy of the Encouragement of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Government, Queen and Nation: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it was tax'd in Print as a Token of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Blindneſs, and a Want of Judgment in
the Miniſtry or Managers of all the paſt Years of
this War. The Advantages the <hi>French</hi> made of it
were look't upon as the great Supports of the War
to them, and what encouraged them to carry it on;
and we were reckon'd unaccountably Negligent, in
that we either did not make thoſe Advantages our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or prevent the Enemy from making uſe
of them againſt us.</p>
            <p>Several Publick Printed Pamphlets diſpoſed to
ridicule the carrying on a War in <hi>Spain,</hi> have
laid down this as the main Point, which the firſt
Contrivers of that War ſhould have attempted in
the ſtead of it, and have made a Jeſt of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
for the Defect; and when the great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Silver which the <hi>French</hi> Squadrons, and
Private Merchant Ships, have brought Home
from the <hi>South-Seas</hi> have been ſpoken of, it has
been frequently accompanied with Reflections,
and a general Regret, that thoſe happy Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
ſhould paſs by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alledging, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Nation, who are ſo much better qualified
every Way, both by their Manufactures to Trade
<hi>with,</hi> Iſlands to Trade <hi>from,</hi> and Naval Strength
to manage and protect that Trade, ſhould ſo
long lye ſtill, and leave unattempted, a Trade,
which in the Enemies Hand is ſo fatal to us, and
which in our Hands might be ſo fatal to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0164202400:5"/>
Yet notwithſtanding all this, ſuch is the evil
Genius of our Times, that now ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
is ſet on Foot, either it is ſo ill digeſted,
or the Perſons uſhering it into the World are
thought ſo Diſagreeable, or Unskilful, or the Thing
itſelf ſo ill placed in our View, that no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of the Kind has met with ſuch a Fate as
this; and if it muſt go on, it ſeems throng'd with
Difficulties, calculated to deſtroy it in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>
            <p>It is needful therefore with the utmoſt Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
to enquire into the Caſe, and ſee where
the Objections lye; for againſt the Trade itſelf,
<hi>quaſi a Trade to the South-Seas,</hi> no Body will,
or can, raiſe any Objection; the Objection muſt
be founded either on
<list>
                  <item>The Manner.</item>
                  <item>The Method.</item>
                  <item>The Perſons.</item>
                  <item>The Time of its Introduction.</item>
                  <item>Or againſt ſome Part of the propoſed Scheme
of carrying on this Trade.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To enquire out this, to weigh duly the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Objections, and ſet the whole in
a true Light, that we may determine whether
this Trade is to be carried on, or no, is the Deſign
of this Eſſay.</p>
            <p>The Act of Parliament, which gives the Power
and Limits the Extent of this New Trade, has
given it Birth, and a Name, but has not in the
leaſt directed in what Poſture the Perſons to be
concern'd ſhall put themſelves, in what Manner
they ſhall carry it on, how they ſhall proceed,
or where they ſhall begin; nor was it neceſſary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0164202400:6"/>
that this ſhould be made any Part of the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which principally belongs to the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer:
The Power of an Act of Parliament
was neceſſary to eſtabliſh a Company, to give
them Excluſive Priviledges, to limit and reſtrain
theſe Priviledges, and ſettle Bounds between
them and other Trades; but how this Trade is
to be begun, how carried on, where they ſhall
fix their Footing, from whence to go on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively
to the End deſign'd, this is left entirely
to the diſpoſe of the Body, to whom the Power
and Priviledge of ſuch Trade is deputed.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' in the Order of Things we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be objected againſt the Regularity of
this Proceeding, yet this ſeeming on one Hand
to leave the World in the Dark, as to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of carrying on this Trade, has on the other
Hand filled us with the Crude and Indigeſted, or
Ill-digeſted Notions, and Gueſſes of the Town;
every Man giving his own Opinion in ſuch a
Manner, that from the Variety of Propoſals,
which every one makes, from the Difficulties raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and from the Objections brought up againſt
the Manner of carrying on this Trade, we are
now brought, by Unhappy Degrees, to all Manner
of Confuſion of Thoughts about it, and from every
Body laying down a Way how to carry it on,
to every Body crowding in their Suſpicions, their
Suggeſtions of <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> being Impracticable,
and the <hi>other</hi> too Hazardous; one Way <hi>not</hi> Safe,
another <hi>not</hi> Juſt, a Third <hi>not</hi> Feaſible <hi>and the
like,</hi> as if becauſe ye are not at a Certainty
which Way it ſhall be done, or which is the beſt
Way to do it, that therefore it cannot be done
at all.</p>
            <p>Whether it be the real Opinion of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0164202400:7"/>
that the Thing is impracticable in itſelf,
or whether ſome Men, for Reaſons worſe
grounded, think it convenient, if poſſible to have
it appear ſo, is not the preſent Debate; if the Miſt
may be taken off by cool Reaſoning, and People
brought to ſee by a clear Light, they will be the
leſs influenced by the Deſign of any, who may
find it convenient for other Purpoſes, that this
Caſe ſhould be as much perplex'd as poſſible.</p>
            <p>To this End this ſhort Tract is made Publick,
in which, if the Caſe may be ſtated clearly, the
falſe Gloſſes, Miſts and Shadows, with which
this Age is amuſed, taken away, and the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
of People on either Hand removed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
we may come to a right Underſtanding of
the Caſe: Having premiſed this by Way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction,
it ſeems naturally to lead the Reader
to a View of the Doubts, now ſtarted among us
about this Trade.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether this Trade to the <hi>South-Seas</hi> can
be carried on, or no?</item>
               <item>2. Whether the Manner of propoſing this
Trade be Rational and Juſt?</item>
            </list>
            <p>It ſeems indiſpenſably neceſſary to enquire into
theſe Things firſt, before we meddle with the
Manner how it is to be carried on, ſince the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
that ſeem moſt to perplex the Town
now, <hi>whether by Deſign or no,</hi> are laid againſt the
Thing in general, that it will come to Nothing
that it is a Chimera, a Sham, has Nothing, in it, is
Impracticable, will be Dropt again, was taken
up to ſerve a Turn, <hi>and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Allegations to ſuſtain this are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0164202400:8"/>
1. They ſay the Scheme is Impracticable; that
you propoſe a Thing not to be done; impoſſible
in the general Notions of Trade; that this was
not a Seaſon for it; that the Countries you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to Trade with are in the Poſſeſſion of the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> our declar'd Enemies;
that 'tis Time enough to talk of Trading thither
when you have ſome of the Country in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that Conquering Nations is a Work which
do's not belong to Merchants and Companies,
whoſe Stock will be exhauſted by any Attempt of
that Kind; that to talk of Trade before Conqueſt,
and Conqueſt before any Attempt made, are
equally ridiculous.</p>
            <p>2. That when any Part of this Country may
be taken from the Enemy and poſſeſs'd, it ought
to be proved that the Enemy ſhall not be in any
Manner able to diſpoſſeſs you again, to attack or
moleſt you; in which Caſe Commerce and Trade
will not only be interrupted, but entirely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>3. That neither of the Nations who poſſeſs
<hi>South America, viz.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> will
ever Capitulate with you, or upon any Terms,
whether in Peace or War, conſent to a Free Trade,
and therefore it cannot be expected that the Scheme
as it is propoſed can anſwer the Ends of Trade.</p>
            <p>4. That it's evident the Affair of Trade was
not the main End of the Propoſal, but other Aims
are couch'd under this Pretence, which other
Aims are not pleaſing to the Parties concern'd,
and therefore were gloſſed over with this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Advantage, to make them paſs the more eaſily
and undiſcovered with the People; but that the
Pretence being equally liable to Objection, as
the Thing deſign'd, ſo both together render the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0164202400:9"/>
Minds of the People more uneaſie than they were
before.</p>
            <p>The Second Queſtion lies againſt the Manner
of propoſing this Trade, which they ſay is violent
and unuſual, a <hi>Force</hi> upon the People againſt
their Will, inconſiſtent with their Liberty, and
that therefore it is entred upon with a general
Diſſatisfaction, curs'd by them that are to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, hated by thoſe that refuſe it, and ridicul'd
by all; that it is a meer Project of a Party, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
to ſerve the Turn they are carrying on
by it, and to put a Face of Payment upon a Debt
which they know not what to do with, and which
made them uneaſie; and all this without a Reality,
that they might ſtifle the Clamour of thoſe whoſe
juſt Demands upon the Government could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
be anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>If the Objectors have not full Scope given them
here in relating their Objections, it is only becauſe
the Reproaches and Reflections which they ſtudy
to ſet them off with, and which they very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
beſtow upon the Government, and upon
the Perſons who they think are the Inſtruments of
it, are left out, as Things which ſeem not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
at all, either to make their Argument more
forcible, or add to the Number of Reaſons; and
this Omiſſion 'tis hoped they will excuſe in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
who is not writing to reproach any Side, but
to calm and quiet the Minds of every Side, and
bring Things, if poſſible, to a clear and right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>The
Reader will pardon the Breach of Order, if
in ſpeaking to the Objections the latter come firſt
in Courſe; becauſe, as they lye rather againſt the
Part already acted Introductory to the <hi>South-Sea</hi>
Trade, rather than againſt the Part that ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0164202400:10"/>
be acted, they ſeem to demand to be firſt
ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>In Order to this it may ſeem neceſſary a little Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically
to enter into the Steps taken on every
Hand to introduce this Affair into the World, and
this without excuſing or accuſing one Side or other,
may be ſufficient to give a right View of the Thing,
and reſtore People to their Temper in judging
about it.</p>
            <p>In the Conſultations which of Courſe employ
the Heads of the Miniſters of State every Year
about the Time of the Sitting of the Parliament,
theſe Three Things generally are the chief.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How and Where to carry on the War.</item>
               <item>2. How to pay Debts and ſupport Credit.</item>
               <item>3. How to raiſe Money.</item>
            </list>
            <p>When theſe Things in their Ordinary Courſe
came to be debated the laſt Parliament, Two
Things with a more than ordinary Weight ſeem'd
to preſs upon the Publick.</p>
            <p>1. A Vaſt Debt, which, whether by the Miſconduct
of the former Managers, or by the Neceſſity of the
Publick Affairs, is not to the Purpoſe here, was lying
upon the Nation in the ſeveral Offices of the Navy,
Victualling, Ordnance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with other
Deficiencies, amounting to ſeveral Millions, which
as Juſtice on one Hand called loudly upon them

Credit was touch'd by it; and if ſome Proviſion
was not made for it, there was Reaſon to fear
Parliamentary Credit would receive a Blow which
would not be eaſie to recover; and which might
be fatal to all the Schemes and Propoſals for
Funds and Loans which might follow, ſince the

Great Sums of Money would too much influence
the future Lending and Lenders of Money, if

2. The Planting our own People in thoſe Rich
Climates, where, by laying a Foundation of Trade
which was never yet ingaged in, Our Subjects
might come to be enric'd, and made full amends
for the Loſs of their <hi>Spaniſh Trade;</hi> and alſo the
Channel of Silver which has hitherto flowed
with ſo full a Stream into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to
the Support of our Enemies, might be turn'd,
and might with the ſame Fullneſs and Freedom
empty itſelf among our Merchants; and farther,
the Settlements to be made there might be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Magazines of Wealth to us and our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>It is Unhappy that a Deſign big with ſo many
Advantages has met with this Misfortune, that
the joining together theſe Two, tho' great and
juſt Proſpects, has been caſually and eventually
the Ruin of both; not that we grant them yet
ruined, but that the Difficulties ſtarted, and the
Uneaſineſſes among us rais'd at the Beginning, are
the Cauſes of ruinous Quarrels, Breaches and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
about it, which it is moſt eaſie to prove are
founded upon the want of a right Underſtanding
and Diſtinguiſhing the Caſe; by which alſo if
perhaps in the contriving and joining theſe great
Events together any Miſtake has been made, it
might with Eaſe come to be rectified, without
gratifying thoſe who ſeem glad of private Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
in order to puſh on the greater Miſtake,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Deſign of rendring the Whole abortive
and ineffectual.</p>
            <p>To Diſtinguiſh therefore rightly of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and thereby come to a Clear Underſtanding
in it, we ought to debate it Two Ways.</p>
            <p>1. In its ſeparate pre-exiſtent State, as a Debt,
and as a Trade reſpectively.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0164202400:14"/>
2. In the <hi>now</hi> Conjoined Circumſtance, as blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, whereby the Debt and the Trade is
call'd, tho' wrong and erroneouſly, One <hi>South-Sea
Stock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In its Separate or Pre-exiſtent State, we find,
as before, Two Things upon the Wheel; or to
ſpeak more plain, the Miniſtry had Two Things
upon their Hands, either of them neceſſary to be
done, and both having their reſpective Difficulties
in the Management.</p>
            <p>1. The Debt of the Navy, Ordnance, Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is no Part of this Work to enquire
how the Government came to be embarraſs'd
with ſo great a Debt unprovided for; whether
the concealing it from the Nation ſo long, or the
very being a Debt, may be laid to any Man's Door,
or no, is not the Caſe here: Perhaps the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of theſe Sheets differs ſomething from every
Side in his Opinion, and may reſerve that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to defend thoſe who may be defended, and
charge thoſe who may be charged, at another
Time; at preſent it is of no Signification to the
Point in Hand, and is therefore much better let
alone than meddled with.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of the Debt is evident; the Act for
making Proviſion for it has ſet it forth at large;
there remain'd due and owing great Sums, for
which there ſeem'd to be no Parliamentary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made, other than the Credit of the Publick;
and which there ſeem'd to be an abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to make ſome preſent Proviſion for, both
as it reſpected the People concern'd, who were
in Diſtreſs for their Money, and as it reſpected
the Publick Credit, which began to ſuffer by the
high Diſcounts allow'd on Sale of theſe Debts.</p>

A Vaſt Debt to be clear'd in One Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

            <p>Theſe Things are not hinted to enlarge the

great, which was of Neceſſity to be rais'd ſeems

running on their Bills, and were better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
than now.</p>
            <p>Where I an utter Enemy to the very Name and
Perſons of the Preſent Managers of Publick Affairs;
were I bent to quarrel at all they did, becauſe they

and reproach every Action of their Miniſtry,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0164202400:17"/>
and reſolv'd as far as in me lay to be a general
Evil Genius, to blaſt and ſcandalize Things for the
Sake of Men, Men for the Sake of Parties,
and Parties for the Sake of Prejudice, a Practice
too much the Mode among us for ſome Years
paſt; were this Paper, I ſay, directed by ſuch a
Spirit as this, yet I could not find any Room in
this Part of the Affair to raiſe the leaſt Objection;
for I cannot ſee, ſpeaking with the utmoſt Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
that in the Circumſtances of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
as they then ſtood, the Parliament could
do any Thing <hi>Leſs</hi> or <hi>More</hi> than they did.</p>
            <p>1. They could not do <hi>Leſs</hi> than take ſome
Care to bring the Debt to ſome Point of Certainty.</p>
            <p>The Demand was Great and Loud; the Sum
was branch'd out into Multitudes of Hands, and
thoſe Hands ſuch as being the Trading Sort of
People, could not <hi>the beſt of any</hi> be without their
Money; this was attended with ſeveral intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Evils.</p>
            <p>1. It cauſed the Poor People to run to the Stock-jobbers,
to the Man-eating Diſcounters, and Money-lending
Extortioners, either to pledge or ſell their
Bills; and the Payments in Courſe appearing
every Day more and more Remote and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
thoſe <hi>Cannibals,</hi> for in ſome Sence they are
ſuch, made every Day their Advantage of it to
prey upon the Neceſſitous and Indigent People,
till the Diſcount of theſe Bills came to near 40
<hi>per Cent.</hi> and the Tickets of Poor Sailors to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſcount, if Sold; and Loans
upon them were worſe, they being not to be had
under 10 to 12 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt, which in a
few Years would ſwallow up the whole Debt,
Principal and Intereſt, as is plain without putting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0164202400:18"/>
the Reader to the Trouble to run over Tables of
Calculation.</p>
            <p>2. This every Day ſunk the Credit of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that the Rates of every thing riſing in
Proportion to the Diſcount of their Bills, would
ſoon have brought the Queen's Affairs to the ſame
or a wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Poſture than his late Majeſty King
<hi>William</hi> ſtruggled with when the Sum given by
Parliament, thro' the Extravagance of Diſcount,
Prices of Goods, and Deficiences of Funds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were generally to be accounted in real Aid of the
Publick Service to be not above One Third of
what they were called in the Votes of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things being before them, it is left to
any one to conſider, whether the Parliament only
giving Money for the ordinary Service of the
Navy, Victualling, Ordnance, Tranſport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
every Year, and ſo leaving Payments to be made
in Courſe, had been either Prudent or Practicable,
ſince every Year the ordinary Service brought us in
Debt farther than the Sums demanded by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
unforeſeen, and impoſſible to be provided for.</p>
            <p>There might be much more ſaid, but it is left
to the moſt diſſatisfied rational Man in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſay, whether to have left the Caſe to Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Courſe, as above, had been any Thing elſe
than juſt a putting off the Evil Day, and leaving
the Debt as a growing Diſeaſe, which may at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be borne with, but will at laſt infallibly prove
mortal, bring a ſlow, but certain, Death upon the
Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encreaſing every Day till at laſt it ſhould
have been ſo great, that they could never have
paid it at all. This I take to be the True, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
State of the Caſe at that Time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſay the Parliament could not have done <hi>Leſs</hi>
than they did, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to bring the Debt to a Point:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0164202400:19"/>
fix the Sum; eſtabliſh a Fund of Intereſt for the
Payment and Annual Diſcharge of the Increaſe, that
they might know what they were in Debt, and
might hereafter take a convenient Occaſion, as the
Publick Affairs would permit, to diſcharge the
Whole.</p>
            <p>To ha' paid neither Principal nor Intereſt
muſt at laſt have made the Debt intolerably
Great, reduc'd the Creditor to unſufferable
Hardſhips, and in Time the Diſcount of thoſe
Bills would have run at 70 and 80 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and
the Offices would ha' been able to have bought
no Stores or Proviſions at all, but what they muſt
have advanc'd ready Money for, which ready
Money either they would not have to pay, or the
Payments in Courſe muſt entirely ſtop.</p>
            <p>Let any Man judge this with Impartiality, and
cenſure it if they can; I muſt own I do not ſee
what the Parliament could do <hi>Leſs</hi> than they did
in the Caſe of the Debt, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to put it upon a
Fund for the Payment of the Intereſt, till Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be made for the Principal, which Principal
it is evident they were not in a Condition to make
a preſent Proviſion for; and this leads me to the
Second Head, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>2. That I do not ſee what they could do <hi>More.</hi>
There are but Two Articles in the Caſe of a Debt.
1. Payment of Principal. 2. Payment of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.—If
the firſt cannot be done, the laſt muſt;
this is only a Conſideration for the Party's ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till the other can be done. No Man tho' he
cannot pay a Debt can be call'd a Bankrupt, if he
offers Security, and pay the Intereſt; it is no
Reproach to the Nation or the Government to ſay
they cannot pay this Great Principal Debt, at leaſt
Now; but you are offer'd in the Nation's Behalf
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0164202400:20"/>
the Payment of Intereſt, and that Intereſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till the Principal be paid: So that in the
Common Courſe and the Nature of Things the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no Way to be term'd Bankrupt; the Debt
is ſecured, and were there not ſomething elſe
in it, this Payment would have been allowed to
be very good; for why ſhould we tread on one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's
Heels to purchaſe Annuities of Intereſt
at but Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> and pay our ready Money
with ſuch Eagerneſs for them; and yet refuſe the
ſame Intereſt for a Debt which we would before
have ſold for 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Diſcount, or perhaps
had bought with that Allowance. This is a moſt
unaccountable Paradox, and to conſider the Debt
in its ſeparate Capacity it is really ſomething My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
on other Accounts, of which hereafter.</p>
            <p>I might add here alſo to encreaſe the Wonder
that the Settlement allows the paſt Intereſt to be
caſt up, and to be added to the Principal, and
the running Intereſt for the Future to be paid
upon the Whole; ſo that the Creditor turns Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
upon the Government, and receives Intereſt
upon Intereſt, which he had no Title to before;
and which I mention, becauſe it will occur again
to be ſpoken of, as being a full Equivalent to all
that Advance, which can be recalled out of his
Hands for the Stock of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company,
of which by itſelf.</p>
            <p>(2.) This brings us to the Conſideration of
this Affair in its Complex Poſture, in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd
Circumſtances; (<hi>viz.</hi>) as the Payment of
this Debt is blended together with a Thing Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
<hi>ſay ſome,</hi> in its Nature Exotic, and remote to
the Notions and Underſtandings of the Generality
of the People particularly concern'd in this
Debt; out of their Way, foreign to their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0164202400:21"/>
and conſequently Diſagreeable and Unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying.</p>
            <p>The
Miniſtry, <hi>if I may venture to ſay ſo,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
had quite other Notions of this Part of the
Caſe, and annexed this Article to the other as an
Additional Conſideration to the Debt aforeſaid,
expecting no doubt that the Excluſive Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas</hi> ſhould be
receiv'd with a particular Satisfaction, ſhould be
valued at ſomething in the Rate of their Debt, and
ſhould have made the Subſcription more worth to
thoſe that ſubſcribed; that it was given in as an
Encouragement to all People who ſhould hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Truſt the Government; that in Conſideration
of their having been kept out of their Money,
theſe Things were thrown in, both to gratifie and
oblige them. (1.) The turning their paſt Intereſt
into Principal, and, (2.) The giving them an Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> a Trade ſo improved
in the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and ſo capable to
be improved in ours.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, ſpeaking without the leaſt
Reſpect of Perſons, the Projectors who contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the Government or Miniſtry who managed,
nay, the very Parliament who granted this Act,
underſtood this Caſe in ſome Meaſure as I have
put it, and the Reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe really in the Nature of the Thing,
abſtracted from Prejudice and Party, it ſeems that it
is certainly ſo. How infinitely then does the Plague
of Parties influence all our Affairs! And how
does it change the very Nature and Conſequence
of Things!</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe, had they not conceived thus of
it, they would never have tack'd it to a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0164202400:22"/>
Thing of this Value and Conſequence, ſince I
believe it will be readily granted, that either of
theſe Things, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the ſettling a Fund of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
for the Debt, and the erecting a Publick
Company for a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> would
have been leap'd at apart by every one concern'd in
the firſt, or capable of venturing in the laſt; and
I think I do not ſpeak without Book in either
of theſe.</p>
            <p>It remains to enquire, why that, which in a
ſeperate Conſideration is ſo clear, and without
exception, ſhould fall under ſuch a general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
when brought together; that there are ſome
Reaſons to be aſſign'd, which are Invidious,
Perſonal, and which the Author of this cares not
to mention, is a Thing rather to be ſigh'd for than
diſputed; but ſome Reaſons other than theſe may
be hinted at.</p>
            <p>1. The ſeeming Force there is in the Act, to
make theſe the Company, and none elſe, and
to oblige theſe to be the People.</p>
            <p>2. The unhappy ſorting of the People, in the
Conſequence of the Act, putting them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Trade, who are neither qualified by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
or Genius to it, and who by their
Ignorance have brought themſelves to diſlike
it, even becauſe they do not underſtand.</p>
            <p>Both theſe I take to be Misfortunes to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of this Affair; and yet both are Things,
which, 1. They could not eaſily foreſee. And,
2. Foreſeeing they could not eaſily prevent,
without putting all upon a Hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0164202400:23"/>
1. They could not eaſily <hi>foreſee</hi> it; for who
could have imagin'd that a Thing ſo generally
applauded before, which we had been blam'd ſo
often and ſo publickly for neglecting, which our
Enemies the <hi>French</hi> have made ſuch Infinite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of, ſhould not be eſteem'd an Advantage
to us? <hi>Or that,</hi> to oblige them all to an equal
and proportion'd Subſcription would be taken as
an Impoſition? I muſt own I'm againſt all
Manner of Force, and think it had been better
here left more to Choice; <hi>But how better?</hi> I do
not mean better for the <hi>People,</hi> but better for
the <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> that their Work had been eaſier,
and the Popular Clamour leſs without it; for
the Advantage propoſed is to the People, not to
the Miniſtry; and the Force then is no more than
as you would have forc'd a Child or a Lunatick
out of a Houſe that was on Fire; and I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
put it thus upon a Suppoſition, that there
is ſome Conſtraint, than argue, tho' the Caſe
might hear it, ſtrictly ſpeaking, that really here
is no Force at all.</p>
            <p>2. But ſuppoſe the Miniſtry had foreſeen that
the Notion of a Force, how much ſoever to our
Advantage, is ſo Irkſome a Thing, that it would
hazard the bringing the Propoſal into a general
Diſlike. Since Liberty is ſo Nice a Thing that
it ſhould not be touch'd upon, tho' it was never
ſo much to the Advantage of the Perſon;
yet I own I do not ſee how they could go
forward (<hi>viz.</hi>) in joining the Two Propoſals,
and leave the Thing more to Choice, than they
have done.</p>
            <p>Liberty is an Invaluable Priviledge, and no
Man can in his right Underſtanding be eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be too careful of it.—I remember a Story
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0164202400:24"/>
of Two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers in <hi>Catalonia</hi> this very
War.—The General finding that the Liberty our
People took in eating Grapes, and other Luſcious
Fruits in thoſe hot Countries, was very deſtructive
to the Health of the Men, that it threw them into
Fluxes and Fevers, and deſtroyed great Numbers
of them, made an Order that none of the Men
under great Penalty ſhould eat any Grapes.—Two
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers had tranſgreſs'd the Order,
and carried the Puniſhment along with the Crime,
for they fell into a Flux, and were dangerouſly
III.—The Officer order'd them to be brought
before him, in Order to puniſh them: One of
the Men anſwer'd, <q rend="inline">'The General may e'en let us
alone, for we ſhall not trouble him long. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Sick as they were, Orders in the Army
muſt be obſerved, and they were brought before
him, <hi>for go they could not.</hi> The Officer ask'd
them how they durſt eat Grapes when they knew
the Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Fellow boldly told him, <hi>That in
all his Orders as to the Service they had obeyed
punctually, and never tranſgreſt; but in this, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
what concern'd themſelves only, they were</hi> Engliſh
men <hi>and</hi> Freemen, <hi>and thought they ought to be at</hi>
LIBERTY <hi>to Kill themſelves whenever they
had a Mind to it.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed upon theſe Nice Principles of Liberty
here may be ſome Force alledged, but in the main
it cannot be ſo properly called <hi>Force;</hi> becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man that does not think fit to come in may
remain in the State he was before; nor do I think
that State is or can be made <hi>Worſe</hi> than before
becauſe other Proviſion than a Parliamentary
Fund of Intereſt could never be made, or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be made; and if I judge right of the
Additional Article, which they call the <hi>South-Sea
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0164202400:25"/>
Stock,</hi> which is reckon'd an Incumbrance, it ſtands
upon this Foot, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that it takes nothing from
the Subſcription which it does not firſt add to it;
becauſe the Intereſt which is paid by this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
upon the Arrear of Intereſt allowed to
be added to the Principal, amounts in Time to
much more than the 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which is to be
called in by the Company to form the Stock for
Carrying on the Trade.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this has not been much thought of by
thoſe who complain of the Hardſhips that this
Trade is to them; and this may be farther improved
by ſuch whoſe Buſineſs it is to defend the Propoſal
in General: Theſe Sheets are not prepared to defend
one Side againſt another, but as far as is poſſible
to ſet the Matter in a clear Light between both,
that they may ſee for themſelves what it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to do or ſay in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>It ſeems very unhappy to this Nation that ſuch
Uneaſineſs, and ſuch Strife, and Clamour, and
Party-making, ſhould be among us, about not
the Things themſelves, but the meer joining them
together, ſince, as it is noted before, take them
aſunder, and I make no Doubt but we ſhould be
very ready to embrace them both: I explain my
ſelf thus.</p>
            <p>I cannot think but that all the Perſons
concern'd in the Debt upon the Navy, Tranſport,
Victualling, Ordnance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe Debt was in
the Poſture and Condition as was before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
would have been very well contented and
ſatisfied with an Act of Parliament eſtabliſhing a
Fund of Perpetual Intereſt at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for their
Debt till the Principal ſhall be paid, and would
have taken it as a very great Advantage to have
the Arrear of Intereſt added to the Principal
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0164202400:26"/>
Debt; had the Act gone no farther than this, I
firmly believe every one had been fully ſatisfied
and thankful: My Reaſons for it are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Why ſhould we not think ſo</hi> when we reflect
on the precarious Condition of thoſe Debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
(1.) How impoſſible to be paid in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages by the Courſe of the Navy? (2.) How
certain to encreaſe every Year by the ſame Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that brought 'em to the Height they were
at.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Why ſhould we not think ſo</hi> when we reflect
how well content People were with the like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod?
Tho' with but 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Caſes, as in that of the Orphans Debts in
the City of <hi>London,</hi> and how long and earneſtly
the Creditors of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Debt have been
ſoliciting for the ſame Grace, in either of which
Caſes the Debt was not leſs Juſt, or more unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ſome Time or other paid than this: But
if theſe are thought remote Inſtances, there are
other nearer our View which I need not name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Let ſuch as queſtion this look back to our Old
Tranſport Debt, Parliamentary Deficiencies, Loans
on Coals, and Culm, Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iriſh Eſtates
Army Debentures, <hi>and many other</hi> the Odd Ends
of the late Wars; for which, during the long So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation
in Parliament, and at the Treaſury, this
uſed to be the Plea, <hi>If they cannot pay us the
Debt, let them give us a Fund for the Intereſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and we are ſatisfied, then we can ſell it, then we
can make ſomething of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Why ſhould not we think ſo</hi> when we ſee, as
is hinted above, Annuities ſettled on Funds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
at the ſame Rate, or rather lower? And
which Annuities are but juſt the ſame Thing a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0164202400:27"/>
this, ſo eagerly purchaſed with ready Money, ſo
eaſily filled before the very Signing of the Act,
and bought afterwards at the Advance of a Year's
and a Year and half's Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the Reaſons why I think
had this Fund of Intereſt ſtood by itſelf as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for the Payment of this Debt, adding the
Arrear of Intereſt to the Principal Debt, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Whole into an Annuity of 32 Years at
6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> with the Principal Money to be then
repaid, nay, tho' the Principal Money had been
then to ſink, it would gladly have been accepted.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee the Misfortune of our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Breaches among ourſelves which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
all this Murmur.—The Annexing to this
Fund of Intereſt, the Priviledge of this Trade to
the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> to be carried on by a Stock
to be raiſed upon 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> only of this
Debt; and even this 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> obtain'd in the
Subſcription over and above the Debt by giving
an Intereſt upon the Arrear of Intereſt in the
Debt. This is the Fly in the Sweet Ointment of
the Apothecary, which cauſes it, however heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in itſelf, to ſend forth a ſtinking Savour.</p>
            <p>Now it would be enquired here why this was
added by the Government? Was it for ſome Gain
the Miniſtry were to make of it? Or, Was it
given in as a ſuppoſed Advantage to the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to encourage them, and to make amends, for
the Loſs they ſuſtain'd by being out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>As
to any Advantage to the Government by
granting the Priviledge of a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi>
and erecting a Company for that Purpoſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0164202400:28"/>
I ſhall give full Space for any one that can to
ſet thoſe Advantages down: I profeſs myſelf ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of any real Advantage made by it, no, not
One Farthing to the Government, or to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
either Publick or Private:—If there is
any ſuppoſed Advantage in the putting that Part
of the Stock which remains in the Treaſury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Form, ſo as it may be paſſed in
Payment, <hi>&amp;c. as it now is;</hi> I anſwer, this is
no Advantage at all, becauſe the ſame
would have been made in the Annuities or
Funds of Intereſt without it, and perhaps more
to the Satisfaction of the Receiver, as well as
to the Credit of the Payer; and therefore this
cannot be placed to the Account of the <hi>South-Sea</hi>
Trade, or brought as a Reaſon why the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
joined it to the Intereſt of the Debt: Nor
indeed upon the ſtricteſt Examination can I find
that ever any Advantage was pretended either by
the Miniſtry in propoſing it, or charg'd upon them
by the Objectors to it; but that truly and <hi>bona
fide</hi> the Miniſtry propoſed this meerly as an
Advantage to the Subſcribers; as an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the People concern'd, and as a Means
to promote a Trade which might be in the End
ſo glorious to the Nation, ſo profitable to the
Parties concern'd, and ſo manifeſt a Foundation
of the Increaſe of Wealth and Commerce to the
Whole. If there are any other Clauſes of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Government than theſe, I muſt own
they are laid out of my Sight; nor I believe can
the greateſt Enemies of the preſent Project find
them out, at leaſt I have never heard them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd,
and ſhall ſay more to it when I do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0164202400:29"/>
               <hi>On the other Hand,</hi> had the Miniſtry propoſed
ſuch a Trade by itſelf; had Books been laid open
in the City for a Voluntary Subſcription of a
Stock to carry it on; had the Adventure been
propoſed with the Favour, and under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
of the Government, with all its Hazards,
with all its ſuppoſed Impracticable Parts; had
the Priviledges and Limitations of the preſent
Act been offered, What think you, <hi>Gentlemen
Objectors?</hi> Will you ſpeak your Thoughts Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
without Party Prejudice, under this
Miniſtry, or any Miniſtry? Would it ha' been
rejected? Would not any Sum ha' been ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed?
Would Adventurers ha' been found, or no?
I am perſwaded no Man will ſay it would ha'
failed; no Man can doubt it, if they will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the forward Humour of the Age in New Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures;
or the long Interruption of Trade by
the War, which has left the Merchants of this
City and Nation leſs Room to extend their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
than formerly; if they conſider the Fluſh
Stocks which our Trading People are furniſhed
with, and their Readineſs to launch out, where
there are probable Advantages: Theſe Things
conſidered, there can be no doubt but ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
ſtanding by itſelf had been very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by the Generality of our People; nay, I
will not ſay but they would have purchaſed the
Priviledges and Protection, now ſlighted, with
the Advance of Money, as was done in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade, and has been offered in others.
Nor am I alone, I believe, in my Opinion.</p>
            <p>But have we not ſomething then Peculiar in
the Fate of this Nation, which an indifferent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0164202400:30"/>
Man muſt needs lament, that the Surface of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
can ſo much alter our Temper, and that our
Judgments are ſo over rul'd by our Prejudices,
that we cannot approve of that join'd together,
which we would ſo freely embrace if offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part?
I am not writing Satyrs here, nor plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a Party, if I were I ſhould take ſome
Freedom on both Sides; I ſhould perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
thoſe People who will reject Publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for the Sake of Private Prejudices; and
becauſe they cannot go along with the Publick in
all their Proceedings, will not therefore go along
with them in thoſe wherein the general Good
is evidently carried on.—I ſhould, on the other
Hand, perhaps ſay, that the joining theſe Two
Unhappy Happy Thoughts together was no To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of making a right Judgment of the Temper
of our Times, and the only Cauſe of the
Diſorder that has happened among us upon this
Head.</p>
            <p>Unhappy Conjunction! That Two Good
Things ſhould make One Bad One; Two Things
equally Happy aſunder, Advantageous, Pleaſing
and Profitable, apart, but put together pleaſes every
Body the leſs, and hardly and Body ſo well as
they would do aſunder.</p>
            <p>If any Man enquires why this is ſo? Why
that, which in itſelf is Agreeable, Uſeful, and
Profitable, ſhould not be ſo when join'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Thing equally ſo? Anſwer might be given
ſeveral Ways, in Brief thus.</p>
            <p>1. The Thing is Party-curſt, it is attack'd by
a Variety of Claſhing, Quarrelling People; ſome
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0164202400:31"/>
cry it ſo much up beyond its real Merit, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
run it down ſo far below, that the Strife
has rendred it a Bone of Contention.</p>
            <p>2. Some find fault with it, becauſe they do
not underſtand it, and ſome becauſe <hi>they think</hi>
they do;—and the Multitude of Inquirers on
one Hand, and Expoſitors on the other; ſome
asking what it is, who know well enough before;
others pretending to tell them what it is, while
they know nothing of it themſelves; by this the
Text is rendred Intricate, which in itſelf was
plain enough, and we amuſe ourſelves with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
where there are none.</p>
            <p>3. The Project and the People are unhappily
ill ſorted, by putting the Trade as an Appendix
to the Debt; had the Debt been ſettled on a
Fund, as above; had Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> been allowed
for Intereſt till the Principal had been paid; or
had they added One <hi>per Cent.</hi> more, and ſunk
the Principal, the People had gone away well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and they had ſold for the full Value; if the
Government had had any reſerved Stock of them
they would ha' been as Current as <hi>Chequer</hi> Bills,
and might ha' been iſſued out on any Account
whatſoever; but clogg'd with this <hi>South-Sea</hi>
Trade, like Two Men in the Water, who are
but Young Swimmers, alone they might make
ſhift to get out well enough, and People at Hand
would help them; but claſping together they
ſink out of reach, and drown one another.</p>
            <p>So of the Trade, it falls among People unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Trade, that have no Occaſion to
venture to Sea, underſtand nothing of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0164202400:32"/>
and therefore they cannot think of it with
any Temper. Butchers, Graſiers, Cheeſemongers,
Ship chandlers, Carpenters. Smiths, (and other
Handicrafts,) Brewers, Bakers, Coopers, and the
like, and an infinite Number of theſe; to talk
to theſe of a <hi>South Sea</hi> Trade is to talk <hi>Hebrew</hi>
and <hi>Arabic:</hi> Like <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Cock, they ſpurn the
Diamond with Contempt, and will ſell Two
of them for an Handful of Barley.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are ſome of the Grounds and Reaſons
of the Contempt of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade: The
Anſwers and Remedies I reſerve to ſpeak of in
its Courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the Particular Article of the
Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> and ſince it is to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to Object againſt the Conjunction, let us
enquire into them complexly.</p>
            <p>1. Is the Annuity the worſe for the <hi>South-Sea</hi>
Stock?</p>
            <p>2. Is the Stock the worſe for the Annuity?</p>
            <p>The Annuity is the worſe for the Stock thus far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that 10 <hi>per Cent</hi> upon the Original Stock
is liable to be call'd for, to be ſet apart as a Stock
for carrying on a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas;</hi> ſo
far you may ſay the Annuity is the worſe.—But
then this is alſo upon a Suppoſition that this
<hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade ſhall entirely miſcarry. And theſe
Objections lye againſt that Suppoſition.</p>
            <p>1. If it does miſcarry it does not follow that
they muſt run out all their Stock; there are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0164202400:33"/>
of many Undertakings in Trade, where the
Parties finding a Stop to the Proſpect, or an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability
of Succeſs, have laid it down with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Loſs, perhaps. One Quarter loſt, or more; and
is all this Clamour worth while for the Hazard of 2
and 1/2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſuppoſing it ſhould imſcarry; for it
does not follow they muſt wind off all the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
it is very probable the Company will ſee
whether they are likely to ſtand or no, get or
loſe, hold or fail, before they have run out One
Quarter Part of ſo great a Stock as is propoſed to
be adventured here.</p>
            <p>2. If it ſhould not miſcarry, but the Trade be
eſtabliſhed and thrive, all this Argument is then
at an End; then happy would be the Day that
the Stock was Subſcrib'd, happy the Thought
that laid the Scheme; and he that cries it muſt
down, now flatters us then ſooneſt with his good
Opinion of it, and pretends he thought ſo from
the Beginning; nor can the Trade be then the
worſe for the Annuity.</p>
            <p>But how can this be, <hi>ſay the Objectors?</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed!
It cannot ſucceed! the Thing is not Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
the Door is not Open for a Trade; to ſet
People to trade now, is as if the Government
wanted more Confederates, and were to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a Body of Men to make War, not to Trade;
that the New Company ſhall join in the Grand
Alliance; and, like a little Republick, help to carry
on the War; that we muſt fight our Way thro',
and trade <hi>au coup de Canon.</hi> A Trade! <hi>ſays One,</hi>
It muſt be a Trade in Blood, we ſee no other
Trade in view; for let which Party ſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
the Trade muſt be carried on by Force; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King <hi>Philip,</hi> nor King <hi>Charles,</hi> will let their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0164202400:34"/>
Subjects Trade with you but by Force, on Pain of the
Gallows, and with all poſſible Difficulty and
Hazard. It is therfore but an Amuſement of
Trade, ſay they without any Reality; and this
being ſo viſible a Colluſion, they tell us, makes
all the reſt be ſuſpected, and is a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the General Diſlike.</p>
            <p>And thus I am brought to enquire, as <hi>in the
Title,</hi> Whether this Trade is to be carried on,
<hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>No?</hi> Whether in Reality ſuch a Trade
is Probable or Feaſible? Or, Whether it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,
and not to be attempted but with a
Folly next to Lunacy, which is ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>To come at this Queſtion in a Poſture that
may render the Anſwer intelligible, it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſtate the Thing itſelf queſtion'd about,
and to lay down in as clear Terms as poſſible
what this Thing call'd the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade is;
what it means as it is now vulgarly accepted;
and what we are to underſtand by it.</p>
            <p>By the Trade to the <hi>South Seas</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
One of theſe Three Things.</p>
            <p>1. An Open, Free Commerce of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to and in the ſeveral Ports and Places of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> either ſuch as are, or
ſhall be, Reduced by us, or by King <hi>Charles</hi> III.
with Liberty to carry our Manufactures and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
Ships and Factor, thither directly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Stop in <hi>Old Spain,</hi> and to lade, return and
bring back from thence ſuch Goods as ſhall be
purchaſed there; and in ſhort, to Trade thither
as the <hi>French</hi> do now with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under
King <hi>Philip,</hi> or as we do to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>—
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0164202400:35"/>
And in this Senſe I think it can be no Offence to
ſay this Trade can never be Carried on.</p>
            <p>2. Or, <hi>We are to underſtand</hi> a Settling in ſome
Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in <hi>America,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Way of Conqueſt, Factory, or otherwiſe,
as by the 6th Article of the Grand Alliance (quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before) we are allowed to do; and keeping
the ſaid Settlement as our own, erect there a Free
Market for our <hi>European</hi> Goods; the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
having Free Acceſs to come thither to Buy, and
we having Liberty from thence to trade to their
Dominions above.—And in this Senſe it is as
Impracticable to carry on this Trade as in the
other.</p>
            <p>3. Or, by a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> we are
to underſtand our Seizing ſome ſuch Part or Place
in <hi>America,</hi> whether already poſſeſs'd, or not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd,
as we ſhall think proper, and taking it as
our own, by Virtue of the Treaty above noted, to
ſettle, plant and inhabit the ſame as a Colony,
erecting there ſuch Trade with the Adjacent
Countries, whether <hi>Spaniards</hi> or others, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the Native Fruitfulneſs of the Place as
much as poſſible, taking at the ſame Time all
Opportunities to open a Trade with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
as much as Circumſtances will admit, and which
there is no Queſtion will be conſiderable.—And
this is the Way a Trade may be carried on.—This
I am of the Opinion is the Way of
Trade the Government propoſes, and what they
mean by a Trade to the <hi>South-Seas;</hi> and this is
ſo far from being little or inconſiderable, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it may be leſs than the Golden Mountains ſome
People have form'd Notions of in their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0164202400:36"/>
that this Trade is not only probable to
be Great, but capable of being the Greateſt, moſt
Valuable, moſt Profitable, and moſt Encreaſing
Branch of Trade in our whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commerce,
well worth all the Hazard, Adventure, Expence,
and Pains of the Undertaking; ſufficient to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us in the Proſpect, and reward us in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
a Trade, which had it been offer'd to the
Merchandizing Part of Mankind, who underſtood
Trade, who were employ'd in Commerce, and
accuſtom'd to Adventures, and not unhappily
join'd in and tied down to a Rabble of caſual
Subſcribers, neither inclin'd to, capable of, or in
the leaſt having a Genius to trade, it would no
doubt have met with another kind of Reception
than now it has.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſht that in order to ſet Things
right among us, People would give themſelves
leave to diſtinguiſh a little between what <hi>is,</hi>
and what <hi>is not,</hi> the Deſign in this Thing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade, and between what <hi>may
be done,</hi> and <hi>may not be done,</hi> that we may not
preſently argue ourſelves out of all the Trade
becauſe we have not the Gates of <hi>Mexico</hi> opened
to us. This is no Part of the Thing, the very
Word <hi>South-Seas</hi> in the Act of Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
otherwiſe, the Words <hi>find out</hi> and <hi>diſcover</hi>
mention'd in the Act tell us otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>We are to find out or diſcover ſome Place or
Places in <hi>America,</hi> where we may fix and ſettle
a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colony, which by the Treaty is to be
our own; and is not this enough? Will not Trade
fall in? Will not the Country produce to us as well
as to the <hi>Spaniards?</hi> Are we leſs induſtrious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0164202400:37"/>
than they; if we fix in a barren Spot that's our
Fault, but why not ſomewhere among the Gold,
the Silver, the Drugs, the Indico, Cocoa, Coche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal,
and the like, as well as they; and being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
here, fixt, and ſettled, can we want a
Trade? Did any Man think all we were to do
was only to carry Goods to <hi>Cartagena</hi> and <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
and bring home Money? This bears no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Deſign, nor is of a Duration worth
our depending upon; for it would be every
Day in the Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to put an end
to it, and prohibit it again. But our Buſineſs is
to ſeize and poſſeſs, <hi>mark the Word in the Article
of the Grand Alliance,</hi> and to keep it for our own.</p>
            <p>This is then what we are to underſtand by a
Trade to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) that we ſhall,
under the Protection, in the Name, and by the
Power of Her Majeſty, <hi>Seize, Take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,</hi>
ſuch Port or Place, or Places, Land, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory,
Country or Dominion, <hi>call it what you
pleaſe,</hi> as we ſee fit in <hi>America,</hi> and <hi>Keep it for
our own, Keeping it</hi> implies Planting, Settling,
Inhabiting, Spreading, and all that is uſual in
ſuch Caſes: And <hi>when this is done,</hi> what are we
to do with it? <hi>Why,</hi> we are to Trade <hi>to</hi> it, and
<hi>from</hi> it; <hi>Whither?</hi> Where-ever we can with
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> or any Body that will Trade with us;
and it is not ſaying we ſhall have no Trade with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when we ſay they will not ſuffer
their People freely to Trade with us; but let the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> get a good Footing on the <hi>South-Sea</hi>
Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> and let them and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
alone for Trading with one another, let the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> prevent it if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0164202400:38"/>
This is what I am willing to have called the
True Deſign of this <hi>South-Sea</hi> Company; and I
am the rather ſo, becauſe I have ſeen no Scheme,
nor can I form any Scheme in my Thoughts upon
any other Foundation that is Feaſible in its Nature,
or Practicable in any of its Parts.</p>
            <p>The Contrivers of this Undertaking know too
well the Temper, Conſtitution, and State of
Affairs, of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to themſelves, that by any Treaty, Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or Stipulation, either in <hi>New Spain</hi> or
<hi>Old,</hi> they will ever be brought to lay open the
Trade of their <hi>Indies</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or indeed to
any Nation of the World.</p>
            <p>Perhaps they might be brought to admit a
Trade to particular Places for Proviſions, Fiſh,
Corn, or ſuch Things as they may more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
want in thoſe Places for the Subſiſtence of
their People: Or, they may be brought to treat
with you for an Aſſento or Permiſſion to bring
Negroes to them; a Thing more proper for the
<hi>African</hi> Company than any other; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for that may be only becauſe they know not
where elſe to have them. But that they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you to a Free Importation among them of your
<hi>European</hi> Manufactures, and Exportation of
Bullion from them, is ſo contrary to the Nature of
their Trade, ſo deſtructive to their own Intereſt,
and would be ſo fatal to the very Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in <hi>Europe,</hi> I mean
as to Commerce, that unleſs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are to
be diveſted of common Senſe, Infatuate, and given
up, abandoning their own Commerce, throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0164202400:39"/>
the only Valuable Stake they have left in
the World, and in ſhort, bent to their own Ruin,
we cannot ſuggeſt that they will ever on any
Conſideration, or for any Equivalent, part with ſo
Valuable, indeed ſo Ineſtimable a Jewel, as the
Excluſive Power of Trade to their own Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Miſtaking of this I believe to be another
Reaſon, and perhaps One of the Chief too, of the
pretended Diſlike and Complaint againſt this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>It is always a Diſadvantage to any Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to have it repreſented in Unintelligible
Terms, and to have it make high Pretenſions,
even to Things Impracticable in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and nothing has been more the Misfortune
of this Affair before us.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken to this largely elſewhere, and
therefore ſhall ſay the leſs here; but without
doubt they who firſt repreſented this Deſign, as
an Undertaking to ſettle a Free Trade, with the
Conſent, and by the Conceſſion, of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Ports and Places poſſeſſed by
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> either ignorantly
amuſed themſelves by their own wrong Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Things; or formed theſe Notions, and
ſpread them about to amuſe other People,
with a deſign to perplex their Heads about it, and
bring the Thing itſelf into Contempt, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>, than to fill the Peoples Thoughts

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0164202400:40"/>
and then Banter them with the Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of putting them in Execution.</p>
            <p>This is ſo much the worſe too in this Caſe
by how much there was no Manner of Reaſon
or Occaſion for this Miſtake; and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Planting, Settling, and Poſſeſſing, as is
above noted on the Continent of <hi>America</hi> or <hi>South-Seas,</hi>
is every Way ſufficient to all the Ends, and
to all the Reaſonable Wiſhes, of the Government
in the Firſt Propoſal: Fruitful of all Manner of
Improvement, capable of as many, and indeed
many more, Advantages than the ſuppoſed Free
Trade with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, which are
already planted; and this, if it were duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
would ſet us right in our Thoughts
about it, I mean as to the Propoſal of ſuch a
Trade being Advantageous to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the Subjects of this Project been Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
bred to Buſineſs, acquainted with Trade,
and whoſe Buſineſs it is as well to underſtand
as to ſeek out New Adventures, it had been
embraced with all imaginable Eagerneſs and
Satisfaction, far from being run down and blown
up in this Manner by the Town; the Diſaſter
lyes in this, as before noted, that the Debt and
the Trade going together is ill ſorted with the
People it falls upon; they that are qualified to
claim the Debt, being ſome of them the worſt
qualified to embark in the Trade of any People in
the Town, and conſequently the beſt qualified
to find Fault with, and make a Noiſe about it.</p>
            <p>No Men are ſo apt to diſlike and complain of
a Thing, eſpecially of this Nature, as thoſe who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0164202400:41"/>
do not underſtand it; and as they are forwardeſt
to complain, ſo are they hardeſt to be anſwered
and ſatisfied by Reaſon; and this perhaps is not
the leaſt Diſafter which at preſent attends this
Project, which perhaps will never recover the
Blaſt of Reproach, thus caſt upon it, but by
length of Time, the Remedy which Cures many
Diſtempers of the State beſides this.</p>
            <p>I know there is another Popular Reaſon given
us for the general Diſlike of this Thing, and that
is, the obliging all the People to ſubſcribe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or no; and much is ſaid on this
Article, calling it a Force, an Invaſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and a Breach of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' the Act of Parliament may be
pleaded in Bar of this Charge; becauſe, what is
done in Parliament is every Man's Act and Deed,
and a Voluntary Conceſſion can be no Force; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
it is no kind of a Force that the Law defends,
and the Nature of the Thing obliges to; yet is
here no real Force in the literal Senſe, nor does
it ſay, that thoſe who will not comply to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
his Debt ſhall never be paid; it does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
exclude them from the preſent Benefit, but
it takes away none of their Claim to both the
Principal and Intereſt from the Government, as
before. However, this is not my Buſineſs here,
the Parliament no queſtion will defend the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of their own Acts.</p>
            <p>My Buſineſs now is to enquire how this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Trade, upon the Foot of a Colony or Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
can be carried on; for having Advanc'd, and,
I think, with good Reaſon, that it can be done no
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0164202400:42"/>
other Way; if I do not ſhew you that it may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
be done this Way, I ſhould be ſuppoſed
writing a Satyr upon the Undertaking, which I
aſſure you I am not.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of poſſeſſing Part of <hi>America,</hi> I
think a Project worthy the Nation, and worthy
the Parliament; and that this War has been the
only Juncture for it that has happened theſe
Fifty Years, and the like whereof may never
happen again; I ſee no Misfortune in it, but its
being tack'd to the Debt above-mentioned; and
conſequently, a Set of People, adapted to the
Concern, who are every Way unſuitable to it,
and uncapable of underſtanding it, better quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to rail at it, than embark in it; this, I ſay,
I count the Misfortune of the Nation in it, and
nothing but an Exquiſite Management can prevent
the Evil Effects of this Misfortune; nor had this
Diſaſter happened to it, but from the earneſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Propoſers had to make the People ſome
amends, over and above, for the ſcop of Payment
they had met with in their Publick Debts; and in
any Age but ours perhaps it would ha' paſt for
an Amends, and for an Advantage, nay, in ours
it would ha' p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt ſo, had it not fallen upon ſuch
a Promiſcuous Multitude of People, not in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
to receive the Advantages, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Thing, or put any Hand to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Succeſs of it.</p>
            <p>If theſe Things have join'd in with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Uneaſineſs of the Times, to render the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as it now ſtands, unacceptable, I cannot
think that this does yet in the leaſt leſſen the
Value of a <hi>South-Sea</hi> Undertaking in general, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0164202400:43"/>
ſuch and as it is; a taking Poſſeſſion of ſome Part of
<hi>America,</hi> to eſtabliſh an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony, and erect
a Trade thither from <hi>England,</hi> as aforeſaid, againſt
which, (abſtracted from the Miniſtry, the Publick
Credit, Parties and Factions, among us, with
which, in this Argument, I have nothing to do)
againſt this; I ſay, I believe no Man will raiſe
One Objection, but all unanimouſly agree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
we wiſh to ſee it put in Execution, as a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
upon which may be Built an Immenſe Trade,
a New, and very much Wanted Vent, for our
Manufactures of <hi>Britain,</hi> a New, and as
much Wanted, Vent for the Proviſions, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
the Produce of our Colonies on the <hi>North</hi>
of <hi>America;</hi> and a wonderful Encreaſe of our
Navigation, Strength, and People.</p>
            <p>It is Impoſſible for the Author of this to finiſh what
he had reſolv'd to do here towards deſcribing the
Nature of, and ſubſequent Meaſures for, purſuing
this Deſign. If this ſhort Eſſay appears acceptable,
I may in a Second Part go forward with it, and
therein diſtinguiſh more plainly between carrying
on this Affair as an Improvement of Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
carrying it on as a National Intereſt. I know
the Endeavours uſed to make it appear a Teſt
of Parties, and a Trial of Skill between Sides;
of this I ſhall take no Cognizance; but if a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part of this Work comes to be Publiſh'd,
I ſhall endeavour rather to ſhew what you may
do, than what I fear you will not do.</p>
            <p>I ſhall diſtinguiſh the Conqueſt of that Part we
may plant in, and the planting itſelf; or, in
ſhort, between the Queen's Part and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
and ſhew you how abſolutely neceſſary it
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0164202400:44"/>
is that they be kept aſunder. That the Trade muſt
be entirely unincumbered with War; that it is
the Governments Part, not only to take Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to keep the Poſſeſſion when taken; that
Protection muſt be effectually provided for, or
elſe no Attempt can be Succeſsful. I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to explain what this Protection will be, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom, in what Manner needful, what
probable Oppoſition may be expected, and from
who.</p>
            <p>2. I may give you an Eſſay at the Great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<hi>Where</hi> this Settlement may, or can, or muſt,
be made; and in doing this I may make Publick
ſome of the Schemes which I had the Honour to lay
were laid before his late Majeſty in the Beginning
of this War, and which were ſo approved of both
by himſelf, and ſeveral of thoſe whom his Majeſty
was pleaſed to communicate them to, that nothing
but the unhappy Death of that Glorious Prince
prevented that this Attempt, (inſtead of that which
has proved ſo fatal at <hi>Barcelona,</hi>) had taken up the
laſt Seven Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Blood and Treaſure
of this Nation, which in all Probability e'er now
would have brought back as many Millions as the
other has carried out.</p>
            <p>3. I ſhall in ſuch an Eſſay give convincing
Proofs, that if ſuch an Attempt may be made,

might be in ſuch a Reſtored, Separated Eſtate,
ſhall be the Subject of farther Conſideration.</p>
