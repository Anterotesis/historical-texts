            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Eyes of <hi>Europe</hi> ſeem at
this time to be turn'd wholly
upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s New
Undertaking againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.
The Reaſons of his
making this Attempt, his Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
has publiſhed by his Miniſters, and the
Memorials, or Letters, which they have
given in to the ſeveral Courts of the Princes
where they reſide, fully expreſs the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Reaſons
why he takes this Occaſion to break with
the Emperor.</p>
            <p>Theſe Memorials, or Letters, are firſt,
The Letter of Seignior <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> Secretary
of State to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> directed to
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, or Reſidents at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0340001700:3"/>
Foreign Courts; Secondly, The Memorial
of the Marquis <hi>Beretti Landi,</hi> Miniſter for
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the States General,
and the Memorial of the Prince <hi>de Cellamere</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> to the Regent of <hi>France,</hi> all on the
ſame Subject, and all tending to juſtify the
Conduct of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in this Affair,
beſides the declaration by word of Mouth
from the Marquis <hi>de Monteleone,</hi> the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
of <hi>Spain,</hi> to his <hi>Britannick</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all theſe Memorials, for they
are too long to repeat here, may be drawn
up and abridg'd in the following Heads,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1<hi>ſt.</hi> That the Emperor does not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
King <hi>Philip</hi> to be King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but
gives him only the Title of Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi>
aſſuming to himſelf the stile and Dignity
of King of <hi>Spain, Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
all the Titles attending the Poſſeſſion
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy; that He (the
Emperor) whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
calls only <hi>Arch Duke,</hi> has Erected a
Council at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which he calls the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Spain</hi>; That he Confers Titles and
Honours, ſuch as Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if
he was really King of <hi>Spain</hi> in Poſſeſſion,
and the like.</item>
                  <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> That theſe things are Evedences of
his reſolving to attack King <hi>Philip,</hi> and
Chace him out of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf if he was able,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0340001700:4"/>
or when he ſhall be ſo; and in the mean
time, takes all Occaſions to ſhew himſelf a
mortal Enemy.</item>
                  <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> That the Emperor Broke the Terms
of Peace and Neutrality, even as ſoon as
they were made, <hi>viz.</hi> That when (his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majeſty) conſented by Treaty to quit
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> where in a few Days more he
muſt have been overcome, and been redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the neceſſity of having fallen into the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Hands; yet he did not quit
the Towns and Strengths, as he ought to
have done, by Conſigning them into the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Hands, to whom they were
to be ſurrendred, but gave them over to the
Rebels the <hi>Catalans,</hi> encouraging them to
hold out againſt his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to return and aſſiſt them, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
the ſhedding of much Blood, and the
Expenſe of an Infinite maſs of Treaſure, to
reduce thoſe Places to Obedience.</item>
                  <item>4<hi>thly,</hi> That he not only encourag'd the
Rebel <hi>Majorkins</hi> in their Rebellion againſt
his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty, but actually ſent them
Ships, Men, Money, Arms, Proviſions,
Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſupport them in their
Rebellion againſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them alſo to maintain their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in hopes of farther Aſſiſtance.</item>
                  <item>5<hi>thly,</hi> That the Imperial Governor of
the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> has, by order from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
Arreſted, and put in Priſon, the
Abbot <hi>Molinez,</hi> a Perſon Sacred by his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0340001700:5"/>
of Grand Inquiſitor, Reverend by his
Age, and who ought to have been ſo by the
Paſports which were given him at <hi>Rome</hi> from
the Pope, with Approbation of Count <hi>Gallas</hi>
the Imperial Miniſter there; and laſtly,
who having given no Offence in Perſon to
the Emperor, is viſibly Arreſted, as an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty, and an Inſult
upon his Government.</item>
                  <item>6<hi>thly,</hi> That his Imperial Majeſty has him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
broken the Neutrality of <hi>Italy,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting
Immenſe Sums of Money from the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> on pretence of its being
their juſt Due to pay towards the carrying on
His War againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That this being a particular
Conjuncture for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Purpoſe,
favourable for his Deſigns, and the like, his
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty thinks he cannot let ſlip ſo
fair an Occaſion, as well reſpecting the
Troubles in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as the general Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the People of <hi>Italy,</hi> and their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to enter into Meaſures, for the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
delivering themſelves out of the Hands of
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the General Heads of the
Charge, as may be ſeen by the ſaid Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
or Manifeſtoes of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters,
to which I refer, they having all been made
publick in the common Printed Papers of the
Town, as to the pretence of the Emperor
uſing Artifices to ſecure to himſelf the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0340001700:6"/>
to the Eſtates of the Grand Duke of
<hi>Tuſcany,</hi> That I look upon as Trifling and
without Foundation, and therefore not
worth naming among the reſt.</p>
            <p>It is not our buſineſs to enquire here,
whether theſe Objections are juſt, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what is Alledged can be made good in
Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Emperor has done ſo
and ſo, as above: Nor is it the preſent
Queſtion, whether if theſe Allegations are
juſt, they are a ſufficient Argument for the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> to take up Arms, and begin
a War in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Deſign of this Tract, is to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how theſe things reſpect the other
Powers of Chriſtendom; and what Part it
is probable they may take in the Quarrel;
and by other Powers here, I am to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
to mean in particular the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> the King of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Cantons of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi>
what ſhare they are like to have in the
Quarrel, and whether they are bound by
the Treaty of Neutrality to Concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a War for the keeping the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Italy</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> yea,
or no.</p>
            <p>I begin with the King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> To make
ſhort with his Story, I ſhall look on him
as one of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> for ſuch he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0340001700:7"/>
is: We ſee his Majeſty acting a very
ſubtle Part, as indeed it ſtands him in ſtead
at this time to do. It is true, the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi>
threaten him, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his Proteſtations of being reſolved
to purſue the Neutrality, they miſtruſt
him, and ſeem as reſolv'd to fall on him in
their Way; nay, ſome ſay, they reſolve to
begin with him. No Man will be ſo weak
as to ask what is his <hi>Sicilian</hi> Majeſty's Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
if he is attack'd; but the Queſtion
with him ſeems to be, whether his Majeſty
having now a very great Army on Foot, in
a Readineſs for Action, and apprehending
the Imperialiſts will certainly attack him,
ought not, by way of Prevention, to begin
firſt, having ſo clear an Advantage, and an
Opportunity, which it is very probable,
may not be offer'd again, I mean, as that
of joyning with <hi>Spain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Queſtion which the Politicians
who conſider not what is right, or what is
wrong, but what is fitteſt to be done, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Intereſt of the Party; I ſhall in
brief ſtate what I think will be the
Caſe here, and as therein I give only one
Opinion, let others judge as they ſee Cauſe,
and let the Event determine. In a Word,
I ſay, I think it ſeems unavoidable, and the
King of <hi>Sicily</hi> cannot be unconcern'd in a
War, if it follows, and that his Majeſty
will not fail to oyn his Arms with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0340001700:8"/>
K. of <hi>Spain</hi>; only that this cannot be expected
till the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have landed a conſiderable
Body of Men on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> either
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> or perhaps high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
up, towards the King of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s own
Country, which is more than probable, by
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General's demanding Paſſage
of the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> for an Army into
the <hi>Parmeſan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore being ſo near a Deciſion,
and at preſent, repreſenting it ſelf to our
View as unavoidable, I lay it down as a
thing moſt certain, either voluntarily of
himſelf, or forced by the Imperialiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
will certainly joyn with <hi>Spain</hi> in this
new Enterprize; and I muſt tell the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Miniſters, who talk ſo loudly of the
Certainty of the King of <hi>Sicily</hi>'s Ruin in
ſuch a Caſe, and let the Event be what it
will, there is great Reaſon to believe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
if not all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſeem to
reſolve to run the Venture of it, if the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
give them but a little more Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
What their Dependence and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
are, Time will not fail to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>I
will not ſay, but theſe Princes may have
their ſeveral Grievances, and may have juſt
Reaſons to complain of the Violences and
Oppreſſions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> I am
willing in Compliment to their Integrity, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0340001700:9"/>
ſuppoſe, tho' not to grant, the Imperial
Governours have perhaps exceeded their
Commiſſions, or that even their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
have been in ſome things invaſive of
the Right of the ſeveral Powers complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
contrary to Juſtice, and to a Treaty of
Neutrality; and I will give theſe Complaints
their full Weight, when I come to examine
the grand Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether for
this they ought to take up Arms, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Neutrality, in which the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Rights is not the only Queſtion;
but by which the Ballance of Power in
<hi>Europe</hi> is preſerv'd: In which Ballance of
Power, moſt, if not all the other Powers of
<hi>Europe</hi> are concern'd, at leaſt thoſe Powers
are, of whom I am more particularly to
ſpeak.</p>
            <p>In this Circumſtance then I lay down the
State of things in <hi>Italy,</hi> at this time, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> are in a preſent
Diſpoſition to Revolt, and that the King of
<hi>Sicily</hi> is in the ſame Caſe, and that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
want a powerful Protection of ſome other
Potentate to ſupport them, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may expect, if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
thus able to protect them, they will
certainly joyn with him whenever a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Army appears.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Pretenſions then, and
the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> being thus ſtated, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0340001700:10"/>
Plot among them ſeems to be diſcover'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> on the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his own Grievances only, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the War, and according to the Succeſs
his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty meets with, the other
Princes ſhall declare themſelves; ſo that if
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould not be able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the Deſign, they may all retreat to
their Solemn Proteſtations of not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Quarrel of <hi>Spain,</hi> and may
make ſmooth Water with the Emperour,
when they find themſelves unable to raiſe a
Storm: But on the contrary, if the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> can force his Way into <hi>Italy,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
the Imperialiſts, ſo as to protect them,
then they will declare themſelves.</p>
            <p>Upon this Foot I ſhall treat the Affair
in general; if I do any Wrong to the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> it will be time to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it when the Wrong appears.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the Hiſtory of Fact:
The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> according to this Scheme,
has begun the War, and ſerving himſelf, of
the Emperor's being perfectly deſtitute of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Marine Power, and of the unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
of a furious War with the <hi>Turks,</hi>
he invades the Dominions of his Imperial
Majeſty, in particular, the Iſland of <hi>Sardig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Fleet, and the Imperial Government not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0340001700:11"/>
three Men of War, could no ways be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.</p>
            <p>Here
we ſtop a while, and make a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
at once to the Courts of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
and the <hi>Hague.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not ſo
ignorant, as not to know, or ſo dull, as not
to think of it; That the Powers or Courts
above mentioned, who had all ſeverally ſo
great a Share in making the Capitulation, or
Treaty for the Neutrality of <hi>Italy,</hi> would
intereſt themſelves in this Affair, as having
charg'd themſelves with the Guarantee of
that Neutrality, and therefore his <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Majeſty caus'd, not only the Letters and
Memorials mentioned above, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in the Nature of Manifeſto's to the
ſaid Courts, but made often a repeated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of ſtopping their Proceedings, till time
might be given to the pacifick Princes and
Powers, who he thus appply'd to by ſuch
Methods as they thought moſt proper to
bring his Imperial Majeſty to liſten to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and to do Juſtice to his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Pretenſions.</p>
            <p>Theſe Propoſals being taken <hi>Ad Referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
did indeed entitle the ſaid Princes and
Powers to make the needful Repreſentations
to the Emperor, and to make uſe of all the
good Offices they found for their Purpoſe,
to induce the Emperor to refer likewiſe the
Matters in Diſpute to their Mediation, as
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> likewiſe offer'd to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0340001700:12"/>
By the way, I muſt here obſerve as I
go, in order to make every thing clear to
the Reader of this Enquiry. 1. That theſe
Powers were more or leſs, all of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
before as Guarantees of the Treaty of
Neutrality in <hi>Italy.</hi> 2. That tho' their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo Guarantees qualified them the better
to be Mediators; yet this Mediation, if they
had accepted it, does not by any Means
tye up their Hands from, or leſſen the
Right they have to act as Guarantees of the
Neutrality of <hi>Italy.</hi> 3. That we do not find
in the Propoſal, any Conditions made with
them, that this Offer ſhould ſubſiſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in caſe they declar'd themſelves accepting
the ſaid Mediation. 4. We do not find that
the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> their High Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes
the States General, and the Regent
of <hi>France,</hi> did actually engage in any ſuch
Mediation. But 5. that being willing to do
all good Offices, for the preſerving the
Peace and Tranquility of <hi>Europe,</hi> they have
concerned themſelves, in the moſt earneſt
Manner to his Imperial Majeſty, in what the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> demands, and to induce him
to accept of the Propoſals of his <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Majeſty, in Order to a Treaty.</p>
            <p>But while this is depending, and before
they have been able to obtain any Anſwer,
or enter into any Negociation on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
we find <hi>Spain</hi> entirely regardleſs of
the offer'd Suſpenſion of her Conqueſts, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0340001700:13"/>
taking no Notice of the Engagements ſhe
had enter'd into with his <hi>Britanncik</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and other Powers, as above? I ſay,
we find <hi>Spain</hi> vigorouſly puſhing on her
Advantages, making Preparations for new
Enterprizes, and even by her Ambaſſador,
the Prince <hi>de Cellamare,</hi> at the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> declaring publickly, that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to do ſo; this laſt Declaration being
indeed ſo inconſiſtent with thoſe mentioned
above, deſerves to be remark'd as follows;

which he had aſſembled at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Inſtances, continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations,
and extraordinary Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
made at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> by the
<hi>German</hi> Miniſters and their Friends, who
were alarm'd upon the firſt Advice of ſuch
an Enterprize, out of a Remorſe of their
own Conſcience, have kept me to this
time under an Uneaſineſs, which your
Excellency, who knows ſufficiently my
Zeal for the Glory of the King my Maſter,
and how devoted I am to his Service, may
eaſily imagine, as well as the extreme A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
thoſe Rumours have produc'd in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0340001700:14"/>
me; but that Trouble was throughly
calmed, by a Letter which I received
from Monſieur the Marquis <hi>Grimaldo,</hi>
whereof I have annexed a Copy to this
Memorial, which I have the Honour to
deliver to your Excellency.</p>
                     <p>I have the Satisfaction to ſee therein
the Reaſons that have induced the King
my Maſter, to undertake to recover <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignia</hi>
by Force of Arms, ſet forth in ſuch
a manner, as ought to perſwade all the
World of the Juſtice of this Expedition.
My Penetration, tho' not very extenſive,
had already afforded me a Glymſpe of the
Solidity of thoſe Reaſons, which are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the Infractions made by the Court
of <hi>Vienna,</hi> of the ſolemn Treaties for the
Evacuation of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Majorca,</hi> and
the Non-performance of the Conditions
on which the Suſpenſion of the Arms in
<hi>Italy</hi> had been concluded. Such Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
can never be forgotten!</p>
                     <p>I put therefore into the Hands of your
Excellency, a Copy of the Letter of M.
the Marquis <hi>Grimaldo,</hi> that you may be
entirely and fully porſwaded of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the Arms of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and be able more exactly to acquaint
the Regency therewith. I cannot add any
thing to that Letter, but a Reflection, <hi>viz.</hi>
That as the King my Maſter, has forbore
hitherto to attack the Arch-Duke in the
Dominions he has uſurp'd from him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0340001700:15"/>
two Motives, equally wiſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
ſo he does not do it at preſent but
at the utmoſt Extremity, and after the
Archduke has violated all the Regards due
to Crowned Heads, and after he has put
upon him the Affront of ſeizing with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the Great Inquiſitor of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Motive is, that the King my
Maſter, whoſe Courage and Greatneſs of
Soul are worthy of his Birth and his Throne,
reſents much more what wounds his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
than the Enterprizes that are made
chiefly againſt his Intereſt, of which I am
an unexceptionable Witneſs, having ſeen
to what a degree his generous Courage was
provoked, when he heard the unjuſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and odious Uſage ſuffer'd ſince the
loſs of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the
Priſons of <hi>Milan,</hi> on the Part of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
by the Viceroy the Marquis de <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi>
and the other General Officers, who
ſerv'd under him, amongſt whom I have
the ineſtimable Glory to have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by a particular Attention of the
Enemies of the King my Maſter, to abuſe
me.</p>
                     <p>Your Excellency will immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſcond Motive. The laſt Affront
offer'd by the Archduke to the King my
Maſter, at a time that he did not expect to
receive a new one, has had the effect of a
new Weight put into a pair of Scales already
full, and has immediately turn'd the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0340001700:16"/>
His Majeſty would have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
made a Sacrifice of his Reſentment,
to the Holy Maxims, which are the Rule
of his Conduct; and would have given it
up as a new Victim to the Good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
if he had not ſeen that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Forces of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
their Allies, were Maſters of the Sea
in the <hi>Levant</hi>; and laſtly, if he had not
been fully convinc'd that he was under a
neceſſity to make an Enterprize of great
Moment, in order to prevent new Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
and confound the Pride of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who to ſatisfy the Pride of their
Hatred, and terrify People by their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
have ſeized a Clergyman, whom
Old Age and Infirmities render'd an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Compaſſion; trampling under foot,
by their cruel Uſage againſt his Perſon, the
Laws of Nations, and the Treaties, which
ought to have protected him againſt all
Impriſonments; and the rather, becauſe
with the Conſent of the Miniſter of the
Archduke at <hi>Rome,</hi> he took his Way thro'
the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> with a Paſs given him by the
Pope. The Archduke, in violating that
Paſs, has ſhewn little Reſpect to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head of that Church, againſt
whoſe Enemies he boaſts ſo much to fight
at this time.</p>
                     <p>I pray God to preſerve your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0340001700:17"/>Before I enter then upon the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of a War, I think here occurs a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or previous Queſtion to be Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>viz.</hi> Is this proceeding of <hi>Spain</hi> an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and to
all the Powers to whom thoſe pacifick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
were made, and who ſo willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
their good Offices with his Imperial
Majeſty, or is it not? Is it uſing his Majeſty
well, or is it oftering the higheſt Contempt
to his Perſon, and to the Interpoſition of
his Intereſt, as is poſſible to be offer'd? Is it
not a Breach of Faith and Honour? In a
Word, Is it not dealing Deceitfully and
Diſhonourably with His Majeſty, making
uſe of his good Offices to Amuſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Prince who they were propoſed to
ſerve; and in a Word, making a Property of
the three moſt Potent Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> in
order to advantage himſelf of their Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and, as before, he had Deceived <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
in the matter of his Armament by Sea,
on Petences, and indeed Promiſſes, of fitting
out a Fleet for the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Venetians</hi>
againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo now Deceiving the
Emperor by the fraud of a ſpecious Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
which no Prince could have ſuch mean
thoughts of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as to believe
he was not ſincere in? It cannot be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
that in this the King of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
is uſed well, or uſed really as one Crown'd
Head ought to uſe another; nor can it be
ſuggeſted, but that when Occaſion preſents,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0340001700:18"/>
and Circumſtances concurs, His Majeſty
knows very well how to Reſent it, and is
not without the Means of making his <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Majeſty ſenſible of it.</p>
            <p>But our queſtion at home is it ſeems of
another nature, and indeed ſomething of a
new faſhion, <hi>viz.</hi> whether we ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Honour of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne ſhall
be ſo far aſſerted, as that His Majeſty ſhall,
upon the ſingle Point of being Affronted,
Engage in this matter? or whether we ſhall
leave the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Powers to be ſo far depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated,
as to take no notice of ſuch Uſage,
and conſequently to be Affronted on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
by all the Kings of the Earth?</p>
            <p>However for once, and to gratify the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
far beyond their Expectations, and
to leave room for all their ſpecious ſoft
ways of covering theſe things over, I ſhall
give way to their Harangues upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> That we
have lately been involv'd in a heavy War,
which has brought an inſupportable Burthen
of Debt upon the whole Kingdom; That
we are but juſt entering upon Methods for
working out of thoſe things, and have
ſcarce taſted the ſweet part of any one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
worth naming; That all the Savings of
the laſt Year have not eaſed the People of
one Tax, neither can they in ſome years yet

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0340001700:21"/>
to come, and that it will be a great many
years before we can poſſibly give ſuch Eaſe
to the poor People, as to bring their living,
and keeping their Families, to be as Cheap
to them as before, and yet their Proviſions
are even dearer than in time of War: That
all neighbouring Countries are reducing
their Expence and leſſening their Debts,
and in a fair way to be out of Debt before
us, even tho' no new War ſhould be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced:
But that every year brings with it
ſome new load upon <hi>Britain</hi> to keep her low,
as for Example, the Rebellion for one Year,
the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Affair for another, and if now
we Engage in a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> we are in
a fair way to continue the Charge of all
the Taxes and Funds that are upon us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what new Demands may be neceſſary,
and ſo the Nation will for ever ſink under a
weight already own'd to be inſupportable.</p>
            <p>To all theſe things, they add the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it to our Commerce, which after a
long Decay, and ſuffering infinite Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the laſt War, began to revive again
in all parts of the World; but will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be overwhelm'd in the moſt ſenſible
parts of it, ſuch as the Trade to <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf,
the Aſſiento Contract, the Trade to <hi>Italy,</hi>
and the like; and perhaps the Effects of our
Merchants and South-Sea Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be
ſeized by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0340001700:22"/>
This is a long Detail of plauſibles, which
indeed our People begin to fill their Mouths
with in this Caſe, and in ſome of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Caſes they are not without weight; It
is true, our Debts are many and great, and
the Nation wants a receſs of Taxes; it is
true, our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade is Conſiderable, and
the Effects of our Merchants are Great
Abroad, and may be liable to be Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'll add to this, That we have Reaſon to
believe from the Wiſdom, and the pacifick
Diſpoſition of His Majeſty himſelf, from
the Prudence and Moderation of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
from the juſt Deſire the King muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
have to reſtore the Tranquility of
His Subjects, and from a willingneſs once
to Enjoy his new Dominions in Peace, and
ſee his People flouriſhing in Arts and Trade,
by which they are now in a fair proſpect of
making themſelves more than ever, the
Greateſt and moſt Opulent Nation in the
World.</p>
            <p>But againſt all theſe Things, doubtleſs
there are other matters that weigh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Scale of this Queſtion, and
which merit to be conſidered by themſelves;
I ſhall fetch nothing remote to make good
the deficiency, for the Subject is but too fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Argument, and the Neceſſity will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0340001700:23"/>
even at firſt ſight, if we go back Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
but a little way into things paſt,
and compare them with the viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
of things to come.</p>
            <p>The Great, and indeed the true Reaſon,
which was always alleg'd for the puſhing
on the late War at ſo vaſt an Expence, and
the continuing it thro' ſo many Difficulties,
as at firſt for many years obſtructed the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of it, was the fixing the Ballance of
Power in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was for this, That ſo many Powers of
<hi>Europe</hi> Confederated to reduce the Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Power of <hi>France,</hi> by whoſe Conqueſts
and Ambitious Deſigns that Ballance was
deſtroyed, and the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> in
Danger of ſubmitting at laſt to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Tyranny in the Conqueror.</p>
            <p>It was for this that the Glorious King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
fix'd the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, as the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
of his Demands from <hi>France</hi>; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
if <hi>Spain</hi> went beyond thoſe limits, he
would be then as much a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> as he
was then a <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was for this that ſuch long Struggles
were made to prevent the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy
falling into the Hands of the Houſe of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0340001700:24"/>
It was for this we Complain'd ſo warmly
of the Meaſures in the laſt Reign, and of the
Conditions of the late Peace, as betraying
the Confederacy, and deſtroying the Great
End of the War, by giving up <hi>Spain</hi> to King
<hi>Philip,</hi> who at that time was entirely in the
Intereſt of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was for this all the Renunciations of the
Treaty of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> were entred into, and the
weight of the Argument acknowledg'd, even
in thoſe very things which were ſaid Eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to betray it, and by thoſe very People
who have been ſo openly Charg'd with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it unprovided for, or not ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.</p>
            <p>It
was on the Pretence of this being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſecur'd, that the People who made
the Peace of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> juſtify themſelves, and
tell us that it was a good Peace, and that it
fully anſwered the end of the War.</p>
            <p>It muſt then follow, that even thoſe very
People ought to be the firſt to declare, that
what ever Prince breaks in upon that Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
Deſtroys the Efficacy of the Peace,
and brings us into the ſame neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
a War, that there was at that time
for Beginning and Carrying it on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0340001700:25"/>
As the Ballance of Power was the Reaſon
of the War, ſo it is the only Baſis of the
Peace; whatever Prince makes an attempt
upon that Ballance, declares War againſt all
the reſt, as they are naturally Guarantees of
the whole; or elſe they tacitly declare that
there was no juſt Reaſon at firſt, from the
Interruption of that Ballance, to begin the
former War, much leſs to carry it on as they
did, which would Arraign all the Princes of
the Confederacy, and Charge them with
Ambition, Unjuſt Invaſion, and Blood.</p>
            <p>Theſe Points carry their own Evidence
with them, and admit ſo little diſpute, that
it would ſeem a meer ſpinning out our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
to go about proving, or farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
any part of them; all the publick
Tranſactions, Declarations of War, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
and Treaties, which were ſeverally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd
thro' <hi>Europe</hi> in the Time when theſe
things were done, are full of it, and may be all
call'd up as Evidences to this one Great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the Policies of <hi>Europe, viz.</hi> That
Preſerving the Ballance of Power in <hi>Europe,</hi>
was the Reaſon of the War, and the Grand
Preliminary of the Peace.</p>
            <p>This then being laid down as a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to argue from, it follows to enquire
in few Words, Is the diſpoſſeſſing the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria</hi> of their Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0340001700:26"/>
reuniting thoſe Dominions to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Monarchy, a Breach of this Ballance of
Power, or is it not?</p>
            <p>I need go no further for Arguments to ſet
forth the Importance of thoſe <hi>Italian</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
than thoſe made uſe of by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who magnified them as moſt mighty
Additions to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs, when
they would have perſwaded us, that giving
thoſe Parts to the Emperor, would make
him too great for the reſt of the World, and
overthrow that Ballance they were given
to preſerve.</p>
            <p>If then thoſe Dominions, whoſe Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
and Influencies are indeed equal to
their Power, were ſcarce thought ſafe to be
given to the Emperor, and were not thought
ſafe to remain to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe
of the Ballance, which would thereby be
in Danger; How then can it conſiſt with
the Ballance, to have them ſnatch'd out of
the Emperor's Hands again, and return
back to the ſame Hand from whence they
were taken?</p>
            <p>This Conſideration alone, obliges not
<hi>Great-Britain</hi> only, but even the whole
Confederacy, as one Man, to Declare againſt
this Invaſion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to
oblige him to put a Stop to his Attempts,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0340001700:27"/>
or make War upon him; otherwiſe, the End
of the late War is defeated, and the Effect
of the late Peace is deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſufficient to ſay, the Emperor
had thoſe Dominions conquer'd for him,
and put into his Hands, and he ought to
take Care to maintain his Poſſeſſion; for, if
the Emperor is, by any Incident of War,
<hi>as the preſent War with the</hi> Turks, <hi>for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
expos'd to the Poſſibility of a Surprize,
it would ſhew a very ill Concern for the
general Good of <hi>Europe,</hi> to let his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which we thought our ſelves ſo much
concern'd to get for him, be loſt again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he (the Emperor) may not be able to
prevent it.</p>
            <p>It was for our own Sakes, and for the
Publick Safety of <hi>Europe,</hi> in which the whole
Confederacy were concern'd, that the War
was carried on; it was not to aggrandize
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that theſe Dominions
were conquer'd, but to weaken the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Enemies, whoſe Power was too great;
and they were allotted to the Emperor, not
becauſe his Arms had Conquer'd them, for
without the Help of the Confederates, he
neither did conquer them, nor could have
Conquer'd them; but becauſe it was meet,
in Order to preſerve this great Article of the
Ballance, I ſay, it was meet for the Good
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0340001700:28"/>
of all <hi>Europe</hi> that the Emperor ſhould have
them.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe ſpeaking of the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
it is not meerly in Compliment to
the Emperor, whoſe immediate Intereſt or
Family, we have no Concern in, that we
are intereſted in this Affair; but it is the
common Intereſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> the ſame which ſo
many Years War was carried on for, and the
ſame which the Peace was; or ought to have
been made for: For this common Intereſt
it is meet that theſe Places, theſe Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould remain to the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria</hi>; and they muſt remain to that
Houſe, or that Ballance be ſo far deſtroy'd,
and the Ends of the Confederates are not
anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>It remains then to judge, whether <hi>Great
Britain</hi> can quietly and unconcernedly look
on, and ſee the great Ends for which they
laid out their Blood and Treaſure with ſo
much Chearfulneſs, and for ſo many Years,
deſtroy'd at once, and a Foundation laid
for the ſame Neceſſity of Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to be laid out again? Can we ſit ſtill,
and ſee Meaſures taken, which have in
themſelves a direct Tendency to renew the
War? Thoſe pacifick Gentlemen who plead
ſo earneſtly in Behalf of Peace, ſhould tell
us the Meaning of the ancient well known
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0340001700:29"/>
Maxim, <hi>Pax quaeretur Bello,</hi> and whether
a timely Exerting the Strength which is
now in our Hands, may not be the only Way
to eſtabliſh Peace, and prevent War?</p>
            <p>It is much eaſier to keep things in the
Poſture they are in, than to reſtore them
again after the Blow is given; <hi>Italy</hi> is a
large Country, a Conjuncture offers to the
ambitious Views of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which
perhaps may be in it ſelf tempting enough;
the delicious Morſel, ſeems, as it were,
dropping into his Mouth; the Diſcontents
of the People there are repreſented as very
great, and perhaps they are ſo; it may be,
the <hi>Germans</hi> have not treated them very
kindly, they have oppreſs'd them with
heavy Taxes, preferr'd Foreigners to the
Places and Preferments which the Natives
have claim'd a Right to, carried away their
Native Troops to ſerve the Emperor in
his Wars in <hi>Hungary,</hi> Extorted great Sums
of Money and the like: What can we ſay
to this, had they applied to any Foreign
Princes to have interceeded for them to
his Imperial Majeſty, none of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
would have refus'd their good
<hi>Offices,</hi> as far as the Cuſtom of Nations
would admit one Prince to concern himſelf
in the Government of another: But that
theſe Grievances ſhould entitle them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
and to go back to a Prince from whom
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0340001700:30"/>
the whole Intereſt of <hi>Europe</hi> was concern'd
to ſeparate them; This quite alters the
Caſe: And to ſay we muſt ſit ſtill, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and ſuffer it, as we have acted in the
ſame kind our ſelves, and from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Liberty we inſiſt upon for our ſelves,
this is ſaying nothing to the purpoſe, for
our Views are in this the Liberties of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and not the Liberties of <hi>Italy</hi>; the
firſt we are Nationally concern'd in, not the
laſt: Nay, if they were together in one
bottom, we ſhould no otherwiſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the Liberties of <hi>Italy,</hi> than as they
were on one bottom with thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi>;
but when they are oppoſite to one another,
the Caſe is quite alter'd. The particular
Rights of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes or People are
quite out of the queſtion; the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Confederates is, the preſerving that
Ballance, which is the Foundation of the
Liberties of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can we ſay in this Caſe that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
is Diſſolv'd, and the Affair is now
no more a Common Concern: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt is the ſame, and the Princes,
as I ſaid, even Natural Guarrantees for
the preſerving it.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid here for the Nature
of this War, the Injuſtice of the manner,
as well as that of the pretences for it: But
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0340001700:31"/>
it is true, theſe regard the Emperor rather
than us: However, I ſhall collect the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
that we may view them, and that
the World may judge of, what Honour,
what Equity, is to be expected from thoſe
Powers, who can ſatisfy themſelves to give
<hi>Europe</hi> Cauſe for ſuch Complaints as theſe.
Some of them are to be found in the Pope's
Letter to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where his
Holineſs expoſtulates warmly, and even
almoſt calls it perfidious Treatment, <hi>viz.</hi>
1. That his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty promiſes and
engages his Royal Word, to him the Pope,
that he would not offer any Diſturbance to
his Imperial Majeſty's Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi>
during his being thus engag'd in a War
with the <hi>Turks.</hi> 2. That his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
engaged to his Holineſs, to ſend a
powerful Fleet into the <hi>Levant,</hi> in Aid of
the Chriſtian Princes againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi>
which Fleet was to joyn the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and
act in Conjunction with the other Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries;
whereas, on the contrary, this Fleet
was not only not ſent to the <hi>Levant</hi> againſt
the <hi>Turks,</hi> but has been employ'd againſt
the Chriſtian Emperor, at the ſame time
when his Imperial Majeſty had employ'd
his whole Force to reſiſt the Enemy of the
Chriſtian Name, and not only has been
thus employ'd; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> have been
thereby abandon'd, and left to ſtruggle with
the ſuperior Force of their Enemies, to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0340001700:32"/>
their great and unſpeakable Loſs and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and to the great Hazard of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;
and the <hi>Turks</hi> being hereby left
Maſters of the Seas, after two bloody En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements;
which had the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet
been joyn'd, would either not have been
fought, or if they had, the Chriſtans might
have obtain'd a moſt glorious Victory, or
at leaſt, the Triumphs of the Infidels had
been prevented, and the Effuſion of the
Chriſtian Blood been ſaved. 3. That in
order to this Equipment for the Service of
Chriſtendom, his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his Holineſs, a Brief for the raiſing
a great Sum of Money from the Clergy
of <hi>Spain,</hi> which his Holineſs granted.
Likewiſe, a Hat was inſiſted for the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,
now Cardinal <hi>Alberoni</hi>; upon the
granting which, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of ſending the ſaid Squadron with
all Speed againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> was renewed;
yet all theſe Engagements were laid aſide,
and the Power rais'd to fight with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of Chriſt turn'd againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Emperor in a Manner ſo ſurprizing,
as to the Faith and Honour of his <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Majeſty, as is not to be expreſs'd in better
Terms than in the Pope's Letter above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
to which I particularly refer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0340001700:33"/>
It is true, as I have obſerved, that
theſe Breaches of Faith and Honour, do
not in particular affect us, or relate to
<hi>Britain</hi>; but the Reader may conſider
them, and compare them with the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
and Declarations of the Marquis
<hi>de Beretti Landi,</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome
the like here; wherein his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
offers, or promiſes to ſtop his Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and proceed no farther than the
Conqueſt of <hi>Sardignia,</hi> but leave the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Diſpute with the Emperor, to the
Mediation of his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, and
their High Mightineſſes the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet, as all Advices now
ſay, and even the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
in <hi>France</hi> acknowledges, his <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Majeſty reſolves to puſh his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to the utmoſt, in Purſuit of his
Quarrel with the Emperor.</p>
            <p>I am loth to make indecent Reflections
upon Perſons exalted to the Dignity of
Sovereign Princes, and always retain a
Reverence to the Majeſty of Crown'd
Heads; and therefore, forbear all thoſe
Reflections which ſome People make upon
his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty, as a Branch of the
Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> ſuggeſting that ſuch
things as theſe ſeem to be Copying after
the Pattern of <hi>France.</hi> I wiſh his <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Majeſty would adhere to the Maxims of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0340001700:34"/>
Honour, ſo ſtrictly adher'd to, and ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
practis'd by ſome of his glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
on the Throne of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
rather than ſend us back to his
particular Progenitors, or to a Court,
where ſuch things have formerly been too
much practis'd; and which I mention with
the more Caution, as the World ſeems to
acknowledge, the Court of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf
is acted now by other Principles, and
may be expected, in a few Years, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
other Maxims, as well of Policy as
of Honour, differing from thoſe which
brought it ſo eminently to the Gate of
Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I ſee nothing can be ſaid then why the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be ſuffer'd unoppoſed,
to puſh on his preſent Deſigns, which are
founded on ſuch Trifling pretences, and on
ſuch Diſhonourable Meaſures, unleſs we
can ſay, that we have no Concern in the
General G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that we are not
as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oncern'd to keep any new Power
from Growing too Formidable and Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in <hi>Europe,</hi> as we ſhall be afterwards to
pull it down; and if it will be our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
as moſt certainly it muſt, to reduce
every Exorbitance of Power in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and preſerve the Ballance on which the
Tranquility of <hi>Europe</hi> Depends, it muſt be
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rudence to prevent the firſt riſe of ſuch
Exorbitance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0340001700:35"/>
As to the diſadvantages to our Commerce
Abroad, our inability to Engage in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
at Home, our being in Debt, and
oppreſs'd with Taxes, and the like, they are
all Granted, and I make no doubt, that as
it is natural to infer from thence, that we
ſhould by no Means Engage in any New
Expence if it be poſſible to avoid it; ſo I
believe, as is ſaid above, That His Majeſty
will not be prevail'd on to uſe Force in this
Caſe, if all poſſible Good Offices between
the Parties can prevent it, and if Reaſon
will take place; in a Word, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will not bring us into a War without an
abſolute and apparent Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>But let us not Depreciate our Country ſo
much, or lay our ſelves ſo low neither, as
to ſuggeſt that we cannot do, what we
cannot in Honour and Juſtice avoid; that
would be to ſay, We are ſo weakned by the
late War, that we are not able even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
an Enemy, if we are Attack'd.</p>
            <p>If our Power is Contemn'd if the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown is ſlighted, if
Princes come to think ſo meanly of <hi>Britain,</hi>
as not to think it worth while to keep their
Words with us, it is indeed attacking us:
They that will break their Promiſes with
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> How long do we think they
would be before they would break the Peace
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0340001700:36"/>
with his Majeſty, if they found it for their
advantage to do it?</p>
            <p>To be Treated thus, is to be attack'd in
the worſt manner, and Great Princes have
always reſented the breach of Faith with
them, as the worſt Affront that could be
put upon them; and I hope, none will ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
in this Caſe, that a Breach of Faith
with the King, is not a Breach of Faith
with the Kingdom, and that in a manner
more particularly provoking.</p>
            <p>As to our Trade, perhaps it may be true,
that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may take ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
againſt our Merchants; but let
ſuch People who are frighted at thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
remember what infinite Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
our ſuperiority at Sea gives our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in War with <hi>Spain</hi>; let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when the
whole Nation was viſibly enrich'd by a War
with <hi>Spain</hi>; and to this, let me add, ſhould
we now heartily ſet about a War with <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <hi>Spain</hi> giving the Occaſion, it is no hard
matter to ſhew how infinite Advantages
may be made of it in the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi>
Capable to make full Reparation for all the
Damages our Trade can ſuffer: But of that
hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0340001700:37"/>
               <hi>Laſlty,</hi> Let it be obſerv'd, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
does not tend to an immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
War againſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi>;
it takes it for granted, that Neceſſity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
ſome Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to joyn to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Neutrality of <hi>Italy,</hi> and as has
been hinted to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to act againſt
thoſe that would break that Neutrality; if
this leads us to act againſt the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> it is not <hi>Britain,</hi> but the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> that leads us to it; and if in doing
this, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> takes if for a Breach
of the Peace, it is his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Majeſty that
begins the War, and not the King of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and the Conſequences muſt lye at
their Door, and not at ours.</p>
