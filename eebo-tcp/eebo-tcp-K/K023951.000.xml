            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE APOTHECARIES.</head>
            <p>TO prevent the Miſchiefs ariſing from Ignorance, or Temerity in the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of Medicines, King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, by his Charter eſtabliſhed the COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, <hi>excluding</hi> all Perſons, who ſhould not be liſenced by them, from the Practice of Phyſick within <hi>London,</hi> and ſeven Miles thereof: Which Charter was ſoon afterwards confirmed by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Excluſion</hi> from Practice extended all over <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to prevent the like Miſchiefs in the <hi>Preparation</hi> of Medicines, the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege were by ſubſequent Acts directed to elect, yearly, <hi>Four</hi> of their Fellows, who, after taking an Oath of Office, were impowered (with the Aſſiſtance of the Wardens of the Company of Grocers and Apothecaries) to viſit all Apothecaries Houſes within <hi>London</hi> only, and to deſtroy ſuch Drugs and Medicines as they ſhould find defective; which Power of <hi>Viſitation</hi> was afterwards, by a Charter of King <hi>James</hi> the Iſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Diſtance of <hi>ſeven</hi> Miles round <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the Exerciſe of this laſt Power being limitted to four Perſons, the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Sir Theodore De Mayerne,</hi> and <hi>Henry Atkins,</hi> Phyſicians to King <hi>James</hi> the Iſt (and who, being the then <hi>moſt illuſtrious</hi> Members of the College, may be ſuppoſed to declare the Senſe of the whole Body) ſo very inſufficient for ſuppreſſing the variety of Abuſes intended to be remedied, that at <hi>their</hi> Deſire, and for the <hi>more effectually</hi> preventing thoſe Abuſes, the ſaid King very ſoon after, by another Charter, formed the Apothecaries of <hi>London</hi> into a diſtinct Society, with the like Powers of Viſitation, and expreſsly <hi>prohibited</hi> all Perſons from exerciſing the Buſineſs of an Apothecary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeven Miles of <hi>London,</hi> unleſs firſt examined, approved, and licenſed by the ſaid <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRUE it is that the <hi>Validity</hi> of the ſaid Charter being doubtful, and the <hi>Extent</hi> of the Powers thereby granted uncertain, and there being no Proviſion for rectifying any <hi>Abuſe</hi> of thoſe Powers, the ſaid <hi>Society</hi> have ever been very cautious in the Exerciſe thereof, and of late Years eſpecially, have kept up the <hi>Form</hi> only of a <hi>Viſitation:</hi> Whence it has happened, that ſeveral ignorant, and illiterate Perſons have been encouraged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Buſineſs of an Apothecary, whilſt others, of perhaps a more regular <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and better <hi>Knowledge,</hi> have in order to engroſs the Trade, by under-ſelling the fair Apothecary, ventured to compound their Medicines of damaged, ſtale, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Ingredients; ſo that upon the whole, great Quantities of pernicious Medicines have been ſold in the Neighbourhood of <hi>London,</hi> and tranſmitted into all Parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>THESE Practices being notorious, the College in 1722, procured the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (now propoſed to be revived) to eſtabliſh their Power of Viſitation agreeable to their Charter. But a Clauſe having, upon their Attempt to obtain a Bill for reviving the ſaid Act in 1729, been added by a Committee of the Houſe of Commons [for granting an Appeal from the Judgment of the Cenſors to ſix Phyſicians and ſix Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries to be determined upon Oath, and in Caſe of Equality of Voices, by the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Preſident or Vice-Preſident of the College] the ſaid Bill was drop'd, and the College have not ſince thought proper to apply for any Bill of that kind, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Continuance and daily Increaſe of the bad Practices above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>AT length ſeveral Apothecaries, [whoſe Profeſſion affords them but too frequent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of obſerving the Extent and miſchievous Effects of thoſe bad Practices,] thought it their Duty, as well in Regard to the <hi>Publick,</hi> as themſelves, to repreſent the ſame to the LEGISLATURE.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0142604000:2"/>
            <p>IN Conſequence of this Application, the Houſe of Commons have been pleaſed to order in a Bill, to revive, <hi>explain, and amend</hi> the ſaid Act paſſed in 1722. From which Order the ſaid Petitioners conceive that honourable Houſe was ſatisfied of the <hi>Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of a mere <hi>Revival</hi> of the ſaid Act, and therefore they ſubmit the following <hi>Amendments</hi> or <hi>Alterations,</hi> as what they humbly apprehend will render the ſaid Act <hi>moſt effectual</hi> on the one Hand, and prevent any <hi>Abuſe</hi> of the Powers thereby granted on the other, <hi>Viz.</hi>

            <p>THAT their <hi>Number,</hi> even if they were to give their <hi>utmoſt</hi> Attention, and dedicate their <hi>whole</hi> Time to this Duty, would not be ſufficient to viſit <hi>all</hi> Apothecaries Shops within <hi>London,</hi> and ſeven Miles thereof, which upon a fair Computation, will appear to be upwards of a Thouſand.</p>
            <p>THAT the original Juriſdiction, and the Determination on the Appeal ought not to be in the <hi>ſame</hi> Body, the Members of which may be ſuppoſed tender of each other's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and the general Character of their <hi>Community.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THAT by the ſaid Act no Proviſion is made for preventing Perſons from entering upon the Buſineſs of <hi>Pharmacy</hi> who have not been properly inſtructed therein, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0142604000:3"/>who conſequently require a much ſtricter and more frequent Viſitation than any <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Number of Viſitors can poſſibly attend.</p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>only</hi> Puniſhment provided by the ſaid Act for keeping any adulterated, or pernicious Medicine for Sale, is the <hi>deſtroying</hi> it, which in moſt Inſtances (as Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icines are principally adulterated for the ſake of ſaving the <hi>expenſive</hi> Ingredients) is a very <hi>trifling</hi> Puniſhment, by no Means adequate to the <hi>Offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE <hi>Alterations</hi> in the Act (it is humbly conceived) will anſwer all the ſalutary Intentions of the honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and yet preſerve to the Society of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,</hi> the Privileges granted to them by their <hi>Charter; Privileges!</hi> ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unreaſonable in their own Nature, that <hi>Parliament</hi> has thought proper to grant, or confirm the like to the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> and Company of <hi>Surgeons;</hi> and that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of thoſe <hi>Guards</hi> againſt the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of Power, which the Petitioners propoſe, and deſire may be provided in <hi>their</hi> Caſe; nor can the ſaid <hi>College,</hi> and <hi>Company</hi> but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, in the Society of <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> a Conſtitution which, in their <hi>own</hi> reſpective Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they have, by long Experience, found to be highly beneficial to the <hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to the <hi>College,</hi> it is true the Power of <hi>Viſitation,</hi> which has hitherto been exerciſed by their <hi>Cenſors,</hi> and the Wardens of the Society of <hi>Apothecaries</hi> in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> is by theſe <hi>Alterations</hi> propoſed to be wholly veſted in ſworn Examiners of the ſaid <hi>Society.</hi> But then in lieu thereof, the ſaid College are intended to be veſted with a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Juriſdiction, and Controul, which the Petitioners humbly conceive is more ſuitable, not only to the Convenience, but Dignity of that learned <hi>Body;</hi> and from the above-mentioned Teſtimony of <hi>Sir Theodore de Mayerne</hi> and <hi>Dr. Atkins,</hi> as well as from the Nature of the Thing itſelf, it appears that the Apothecaries are very properly qualified for the <hi>Viſitation</hi> hereby propoſed to be entruſted with them.</p>
            <p>As to the Perſons who will be immediately affected by the <hi>Examination</hi> intended by theſe Amendments,—It is ſubmitted whether it can be thought an <hi>Hardſhip</hi> to oblige thoſe who will engage in a Profeſſion, of ſo much Conſequence to the Publick, to give a Teſt of their Ability and Fitneſs for it; and as they will become intituled to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Privileges,</hi> without being ſubject to the many burthenſome and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Offices</hi> of the ſaid Society, it is but reaſonable that they ſhould contribute <hi>ſomething</hi> towards defraying the <hi>additional</hi> Expences which theſe new Duties will occaſion.</p>
            <p>THE Application of the yearly Sum of ſix Shillings (it is likewiſe hoped) will be thought ſo very uſeful to the <hi>Publick,</hi> that no Objection can be made to ſo <hi>trifling</hi> a Demand.</p>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Society</hi> do (at an Expence too great for their preſent Circumſtances) endeavour to maintain a Botanical Garden, which the Munificence of that great Patron of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and uſeful Knowledge, <hi>Sir Hans Sloane,</hi> has enabled them to eſtabliſh: A Matter in ſeveral <hi>foreign</hi> Cities, thought worthy of the <hi>Publick</hi> Care. At this Garden, (at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent furniſhed with as great a Number of <hi>Plants</hi> as perhaps any in <hi>Europe</hi>) a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrator is appointed by the <hi>Society,</hi> to inſtruct their Members, and Pupils in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Branch of <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> and to ſuperintend, at proper Times, <hi>Herborizations</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>London;</hi> of all which Advantages the ſaid <hi>Licentiates</hi> and their Apprentices will be entitled to partake.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, the <hi>Petitioners</hi> humbly hope the Publick will, by theſe Propoſals, be ſatisfied that they have no <hi>unreaſonable</hi> Views of enriching the <hi>Society,</hi> of which they are Members, or of procuring any particular Advantage to <hi>themſelves;</hi> their ſole <hi>Intention,</hi> in offering to take this <hi>Burthen</hi> upon them, being that they may contribute as much as in them lies to the preventing <hi>Frauds</hi> in their Profeſſion. And as a Proof that they have no <hi>oppreſſive</hi> Views, they decline no <hi>Appeal</hi> to any Juriſdiction the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> ſhall think proper, not deſiring to be truſted with a Power over <hi>others,</hi> which they would be ſorry to ſee granted to any, over <hi>themſelves:</hi> neither do they wiſh for more than a temporary <hi>Probation</hi> of their Scheme, that ſo, if it ſhall be found <hi>hurtful</hi> or ineffectual, it may not be intailed upon <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
