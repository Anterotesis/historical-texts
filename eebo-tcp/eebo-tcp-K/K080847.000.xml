            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Thus would be-critics cenſure modern plays;</l>
               <l>Some are too dull, without intrigue, or jeſt—</l>
               <l>And ſome mere ſpeaking pantomimes at beſt;</l>
               <l>That living authors are by dead ſurpaſt,</l>
               <l>So he muſt write the worſt, who writes the laſt—</l>
               <l>Still each new drama captiouſly they blame,</l>
               <l>And, though the town be pleas'd, deny it ſame.</l>
               <l>Should this deciſion be allow'd as juſt,</l>
               <l>The bays denied the Bard, may grace his buſt!</l>
               <l>But if this taſte for antiques we purſue,</l>
               <l>Age may improve wit, wine, and women too.</l>
               <l>One <hi>old opinion</hi> we would ſtill retain,</l>
               <l>The right that England has to rule the main!</l>
               <l>Long as the ſea ſhall fence our envied land,</l>
               <l>Long as our navy ſhall the ſea command;</l>
               <l>So long ſhall Howe's, St. Vincent's, Duncan's name,</l>

                     <speaker>Cook.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I thinks, that for the death of an old maſter, a little dripping from the eyes would be quite natural.</p>

                     <speaker>Valet.</speaker>
                     <p>It may be natural, maſter Cook; but lord bleſs you, the genteel feel of your tip top folks, is no more like nature, than one of your fine kabobbed fricaſſees is to plain roaſt and <hi>taties.</hi> Beſides, when a man leaves behind him a good ten thouſand a year, I think it quite natural for the heir to laugh.

               <l>'Tis—"ſtir that fire, give me ſome coffee, wife."</l>

            <q>We can recommend this ſtory as uniting to a great degree of intereſt the rarer qualities of good ſenſe, and an accurate knowledge of mankind. The grammatical errors and vulgariſms which diſgrace many even of our moſt celebrated novels, have here no place; and ſeveral of the ſhorter poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical pieces interſperſed through the work, have very conſiderable merit. Amuſement is combined with utility, and fiction is inliſted in the cauſe of virtue and practical philoſophy.

            <p>The Monthly Critics, who have already reviewed this new work, ſpeak of it in the following words:</p>
            <p>The writers of the Monthly Revicw for laſt month ſay, "We cannot diſmiſs theſe volumes without obſerving, that they contain a conſiderable portion of political information. The work will, by its diſcerning readers, be characterized as highly intereſting; and it will prove particularly ſo to thoſe who ſtill remember the times to which the anecdotes here recorded are referable. To the future hiſtorian alſo it will afford much aſſiſtance, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing, in many inſtances, towards the means of information, which, but for publications of this kind, might be utterly conſigned to oblivion.</p>
            <p>The writers of the Analytical Review for January laſt, ſay, "The work before us will be found particularly intereſting to thoſe who wiſh to obtain an idea of the management of ſtate affairs in this country, during the whole of the preſent reign."</p>
            <p>The writers of the Gentleman's Magazine for January laſt, ſay, "Theſe volumes are written by the author of the Anecdotes of the late Earl of Chatham, and are not inferior to that work either in intereſt or intelligence. Thoſe perſons who are fond of reading the political anecdotes of their own times, particularly from the year 1760 to the year 1780, (an important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod), which, the writer aſſures us, have not been printed, will receive fiom this work much pleaſure and information."</p>
            <p>The writers of the European Magazine, ſay, "The editor of theſe volumes is entitled to the thanks of the public, for preſerving many facts which otherwiſe might have fallen into oblivion. The reader will find entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and information in them, and the future inveſtigator of the acts of the preſent reign will meet with ſome valuable materials to exerciſe his ſagacity upon, which are to be no where elſe found, and which will ſerve to guide him through the obſcure paths of political fineſſe."</p>

            <q>The author has made a valuable Collection of Anecdotes, eſpecially of the late and moſt conſpicuous part of Lord Chatham's Life; and of other matters connected with it. He ſays he is not conſcious of having advanced one falſehood: We give credit to his declaration, having found no cauſe to doubt it.

            <q>We have found ſo many lively and pleaſant exhibitions of manners, ſo many amuſing and intereſting anecdotes, and ſo many obſervations and reflections, gay and grave, ſportive and ſentimental, (all expreſſed in a gay and familiar ſtyle,) better ſuited to the purpoſe than ſentences laboured with artificial exactneſs, that we cannot but recommend it to our readers as a highly amuſing and intereſting performance.
