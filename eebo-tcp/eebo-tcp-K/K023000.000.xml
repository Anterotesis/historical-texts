            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As for the Letters we have procured to be added, they ſerve but to compleat, explain, and ſometimes ſet in a true light, thoſe others, which it was not in the Writer's or Our power to recall.</p>
            <p>This Collection hath been owing to ſeveral Cabinets; ſome drawn from thence by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and others (even of thoſe to Ladies) voluntarily given. It is to one of that Sex we are beholden for the whole Correſpondence with <hi>H. C.</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which Letters being lent her by that Gentleman, ſhe took the Liberty to print; as appears by the following, which we ſhall give at length, both as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing curious, and as it may ſerve for an Apology for our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>AFTER ſo long a ſilence, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great oppreſſions I have ſigh'd under has occaſion'd, one is at a Loſs how
<pb facs="tcp:0096900700:10"/>
to begin a letter to ſo kind a friend as your ſelf. But as it was always my reſolution, if I muſt ſink, to do it as decently [that is as ſilently] as I cou'd: ſo when I found my ſelf plung'd into unforeſeen, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable ruin, I retreated from the world, and in a manner buried my ſelf in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal place, where I knew none, nor none knew me. In this dull unthinking way, I have protracted a lingring death, [for life it cannot be call'd] ever ſince you ſaw me, ſequeſter'd from company, depriv'd of my books, and nothing left to converſe with but the Letters of my dead, or abſent, friends, amongſt which latter I always plac'd your's, and Mr <hi>Pope</hi>'s, in the firſt rank. I lent ſome of them indeed to an ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was ſo delighted with the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that he importuned me for a ſight of the reſt, which having obtained, he convey'd them to the Preſs, I muſt not ſay altogether with my conſent, nor wholly without it. I thought them too good to be loſt in oblivion, and had no cauſe to apprehend the diſobliging of any. The publick, <hi>viz.</hi> all perſons of taſte and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wou'd be pleas'd with ſo agreeable an amuſement; Mr <hi>Cromwell</hi> cou'd not be angry, ſince it was but juſtice to his merit, to publiſh the ſolemn, and private profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Love, Gratitude, and Veneration,
<pb facs="tcp:0096900700:11"/>
made him by ſo celebrated an Author; and ſurely Mr <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to reſent the publication, ſince the early pregnancy of his Genius was no diſhonour to his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. And yet had either of you been aſk'd, common modeſty wou'd have oblig'd you to refuſe, what you wou'd not be diſpleas'd with, if done without your knowledge: And beſides to end all diſpute, you had been pleas'd to make me a free gift of them, to do what I pleas'd with them: and every one knows that the perſon to whom a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is addreſs'd, has the ſame right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, as he has of goods purchas'd with his money. I doubt not but your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and honour will do me the right, of owning by a line, that I came honeſtly by them. I flatter my ſelf, in a few months I ſhall again be viſible to the world, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thro' good providence that Turn ſhall happen, I ſhall joyfully acquaint you with it, there being none more truly your oblig'd Servant, than, <hi>Sir,</hi>

                  <p>WHEN theſe Letters were firſt print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I wond'red how <hi>Curll</hi> cou'd come by 'em, and cou'd not but laugh at the pompous title; ſince whatever you wrote to me was humour, and familiar Raillery. As ſoon as I came from <hi>Epſom,</hi> I heard you had been to ſee me, and I writ you a ſhort letter from <hi>Will</hi>'s, that I long'd to ſee you.

T.</hi> I began to fear that I was guilty. I have never ſeen theſe Letters of <hi>Curll</hi>'s, nor wou'd go to his ſhop about them; I have not ſeen this <hi>Sapho,</hi> alias <hi>E. T.</hi> theſe ſeven years;—her writing, <hi>That I gave her 'em, to do what ſhe wou'd with 'em,</hi> is ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the point too far: I thought not of it; nor do I think ſhe did then: But ſevere Neceſſity, which catches hold of a Twig, has produced all this; which has lain hid, and forgot by me, ſo many years. <hi>Curll</hi> ſent me a Letter laſt week, deſiring a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive anſwer about this matter, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I wou'd give him none, he went to <hi>E.

I am extremely concern'd, that my former Indiſcretion in putting 'em into the hands of this <hi>Pretieuſe,</hi> ſhou'd have given you ſo much diſturbance; for the laſt thing I ſhou'd do wou'd be to diſoblige you; for whom I have ever preſerv'd the greateſt eſteem, and ſhall ever be, <hi>Sir,</hi>

By the interval of twelve years at leaſt, from her poſſeſſion, to the time of printing 'em, 'tis manifeſt, that I had not the leaſt ground to apprehend ſuch a deſign: But as People in great ſtraits, bring forth their hoards of old Gold, and moſt valued Jewels, ſo <hi>Sapho</hi> had recourſe to her hid treaſure of Letters, and play'd off, not only your's to me, but all thoſe to herſelf (as the Lady's laſt-ſtake) into the preſs.—As for me, I hope, when you ſhall cooly conſider the many thouſand inſtances of our being deluded by the females, ſince that great Original of <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Eve,</hi> you will have a more favourable thought of the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning error of.</p>

               <p>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of yours of the 8th inſtant; and will make you a true excuſe, (tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no very good one) that I defer'd the troubling you with a letter, when I ſent back your Papers, in hopes of ſeeing you at <hi>Binfield</hi> before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I ſhould freely now (as I have done too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly in converſation with you) tell
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0096900700:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you my opinion; which I have frequently ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance with your deſires, than that I could think it reaſonable. For I am not yet ſatisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of Poetry, who never have been practis'd in the Art. There may poſſibly be ſome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py genius's, who may judge of ſome of the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture: But this, tho' it may ſometimes be in the right, muſt be ſubject to many miſtakes, and is certainly but a ſuperficial knowledge; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into the art, the methods, and the particular excellencies of the whole compoſure, in all the parts of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides my want of skill, I have another reaſon why I ought to ſuſpect my ſelf, by reaſon of the great affection I have for you, which might give too much biaſs, to be kind to every thing that comes from you; but after all, I muſt ſay (and I do it with an old-faſhion'd ſincerity.) that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely approve of your Tranſlation of thoſe Pieces of <hi>Homer,</hi> both as to the verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the true ſenſe that ſhines thro' the whole; nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occaſion, that you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0096900700:18"/>
wou'd proceed in tranſlating that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Poet, to make him ſpeak good <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> to dreſs his admirable characters in your proper, ſignificant, and expreſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and to make his works as uſeful and inſtructive to this degenerate age, as he was to our friend <hi>Horace,</hi> when he read him at <hi>Praeneſte, Qui, quid ſit pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</hi> &amp;c. I break off with that <hi>quid non?</hi> with which I confeſs I am charm'd.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, I intreat you to ſend this preſently to be added to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanies, and I hope it will come time enough for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to ſay of my Nephew <hi>B</hi>'s obſervations, for he ſent them to me ſo late, that I had not time to conſider them; I dare ſay he endeavour'd very faithfully (tho' he told me very haſtily) to execute your commands.</p>
               <p>All I can add is, that if your exceſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſhou'd hinder you from publiſhing this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I ſhall only be ſorry that I have no more credit with you, to perſuade you to oblige the publick, and very particularly, dear Sir,</p>

               <p>I Send you <hi>Dennis</hi>'s remarks on the <note n="*" place="bottom">On Criticiſm.</note>
                  <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> which equally abound in juſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms and fine Railleries: The few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in my hand in the margins, are what a morning's leiſure permitted me to make, purely for your peruſal. For I am of opinion, that ſuch a Critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book, is but one way to be properly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, and that way I wou'd not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time perſecuted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. This I knew not before; if I had, his name had been ſpar'd in the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> for that only reaſon. I can't conceive what ground he has for ſo exceſſive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; nor imagine how thoſe <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <q>
                        <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> reddens at each word you ſpeak,</l>
                        <l>And ſtares tremendous with a threatning eye,</l>
                        <l>Like ſome fierce Tyrant in old Tapeſtry.</l>
                     </q>
                  </note>three lines can be call'd a reflection on his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which only deſcribe him ſubject a little to Anger on ſome occaſions. I have heard of combatants ſo very furious, as to fall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0096900700:20"/>
down themſelves with that very blow which they deſign'd to lay heavy on their anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts. But if Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s rage proceeds only from a zeal to diſcourage young and unexperienc'd writers from ſcribling, he ſhou'd frighten us with his Verſe not Proſe: for I have often known, that when all the precepts in the world would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a ſinner, ſome very ſad example has done the buſineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Thought we find afterwards put into Verſe in the <hi>Dunciad, Book</hi> 1.</note> Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with reaſon, and I will alter 'em in caſe of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindneſs where he meant an injury, and ſo ſerve inſtead of a friend. What he obſerves at the bottom of page 20th of his reflections, was objected to by yourſelf, and had been mended but for the haſte of the preſs: 'Tis right <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> and I confeſs it what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call a <hi>Bull</hi> in the expreſſion, tho' the ſenſe be manifeſt enough: Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Bulls are ſeldom in the expreſſion, they are always in the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall certainly never make the leaſt reply to him, not only becauſe you adviſe me, but becauſe I have ever been of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that if a book can't anſwer for itſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0096900700:21"/>
to the publick, 'tis to no ſort of purpoſe for its author to do it. If I am wrong in any ſentiment of that <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I proteſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, I don't deſire all the world ſhould be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill conſequence) meerly that I my ſelf may be thought right, which is of very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.) I'd be the firſt to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of my ſelf; for (as I take it) when a man owns himſelf to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wiſer than he was. But I have had an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the publiſhing that book of <hi>D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s</hi>'s, which otherwiſe I ſhould never have known: It has been the occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me friends, and open abetters, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gentlemen of known ſenſe and wit; and of proving to me what I have till now doubted, that my writings are taken ſome notice of by the world in general, or I ſhould never be attack'd thus in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. I have read that 'twas a cuſtom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> while a General rode in triumph, to have common ſoldiers in the ſtreets that rail'd at him and reproach'd him; to put him in mind, that tho' his ſervices were in the main approved and rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep him humble.</p>

You will ſee by this, that whoever ſets up for wit in theſe days, ought to have the conſtancy of a primitive Chriſtian, and be prepar'd to ſuffer martyrdom in the cauſe of it. But ſure this is the firſt time that a Wit was attack'd for his <hi>Religion,</hi> as you'll find I am moſt zealouſly in this treatiſe: and you know, Sir, what alarms I have had from the <note n="*" place="bottom">See the enſuing Letters.</note>oppoſite ſide on this account.

               <p>The manner in which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> takes to pieces ſeveral particular lines, detach'd from their natural places, may ſhew how eaſy it is to a caviller to give a new ſenſe, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0096900700:23"/>
a new nonſenſe to any thing. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his conſtructions are not more wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the genuine meaning, than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts, as they call'd 'em.</p>
               <p>Our friend the <hi>Abbè</hi> is not of that ſort, who with the utmoſt candour and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, has modeſtly told me what others thought, and ſhewn himſelf one (as he very well expreſſes it) rather of a <hi>Number</hi> than a <hi>Party.</hi> The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks moſt ſorts of learning flouriſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em, and I am of opinion that only ſome ſort of learning was barely kept alive by 'em: he believes, that in the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and obvious ſenſe, that line (<hi>A ſecond deluge Learning over-run</hi>) will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be underſtood only (as 'tis meant) of polite Learning, Criticiſm, Poetry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the only learning concern'd in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Eſſay.</hi> It is true, that the <hi>Monks</hi> did preſerve what learning there was, about <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth's time; but thoſe who ſucceeded fell into the depth of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, or at leaſt ſtood at a ſtay while others roſe from thence, inſomuch that even <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Reuchlin</hi> could hardly laugh them out of it.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0096900700:24"/>
in not concealing what he thinks my error. And his teſtifying ſome eſteem for the book, juſt at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour againſt it, is an inſtance of great generoſity and candor, which I ſhall ever acknowledge.</p>

               <p>IN your laſt you inform'd me of the miſtaken zeal of ſome people, who ſeem to make it no leſs their buſineſs to perſuade men they are erroneous, than Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do that they are ſick; only that they may magnify their own cure, and triumph over an imaginary diſtemper.

to <hi>ſublime the ſouthern wits,</hi> and to <hi>ripen the genius's of northern climates?</hi> I fear theſe gentlemen underſtand grammar as little as they do criticiſm; and perhaps out of good nature to the Monks, are willing to take from 'em the cenſure of ignorance, and to have it to themſelves. The word <hi>They</hi> refers (as I am ſure I meant, and as I thought every one muſt have known) to thoſe critics there ſpoken of, who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to ſome particular ſett of writers, to the prejudice of all others. And the very ſimile it ſelf, if twice read, may convince them, that the cenſure here of damning, lies not on our Church at all, unleſs they call our Church <hi>one ſmall Sect:</hi> and the cautious words, (<hi>by each Man</hi>) manifeſtly ſhow it a general reflection on all ſuch (whoever they are) who entertain thoſe narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, I promiſe you, Sir, if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of ſound faith tho' weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will (tho' it were from no other principle than that of common good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) comply with it.

If the heat of theſe good diſputants (who, I am afraid, being bred up to wrangle in the ſchools, cannot get rid of the humor all their lives) ſhou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo far as to perſonal reflections upon me, I aſſure you notwithſtanding I will do, or ſay nothing, however provok'd (for ſome people can no more provoke than oblige) that is unbecoming the character of a true Catholick. I will ſet before me the example of that great man, and great Saint <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> who in the midſt of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny proceeded with all the calmneſs of innocence, and the unrevenging ſpirit of primitive chriſtianity. However I wou'd adviſe them to ſuffer the mention of <hi>him</hi> to paſs unregarded, leſt I ſhould be forc'd to do that for his reputation which I wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to vindicate ſo great a light of our Church from the malice of paſt times, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the preſent, in a language which may extend farther than that in which the Trifle about Criticiſm is written. I wiſh theſe gentlemen wou'd be contented with finding fault with me only, who will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly am concern'd; I have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to diſturb it

               <p>THE concern which you more than ſeem to be affected with for my reputation, by the ſeveral accounts you have ſo obligingly given of what reports and cenſures the holy <hi>Vandals</hi> have thought fit to paſs upon me, makes me deſirous of telling ſo good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of letting before you in a clear light the true ſtate of it.</p>
               <p>I have ever believ'd the beſt piece of ſervice one cou'd do to our religion, was openly to expreſs our deteſtation and ſcorn of all thoſe mean artifices and <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> which it ſtands ſo little in need of, and which have laid it under ſo great a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal among its enemies.</p>

Nothing has been ſo much a ſcarecrow to them, as that too peremptory and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly-uncharitable aſſertion of an utter <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but ourſelves; <hi>invincible</hi> ignorance excepted, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome people define under ſo great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, and with ſuch excluſions, that it ſeems as if that word were rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as a ſalvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl'd about ſo freely on almoſt all mankind by the Hands of eccleſiaſticks) than as a real exception to almoſt-univerſal damnation. For, beſides the ſmall number of the truly faithful in our Church, we muſt again ſubdivide; the <hi>Janſeniſt</hi> is damned by the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> by the <hi>Janſeniſt,</hi> the <hi>Scotiſt</hi> by the <hi>Thomiſt,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>There may be errors I grant, but I can't think 'em of ſuch conſequence as to deſtroy utterly the charity of mankind; the very greateſt bond in which we are engag'd by God to one another. Therefore I own to you, I was glad of any opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my diſlike of ſo ſhocking a ſentiment as thoſe of the religion I profeſs are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly charg'd with; and I hop'd, a ſlight inſinuation, introduc'd ſo eaſily by a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ſimilitude only, cou'd never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven offence; but on the contrary muſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0096900700:29"/>
needs have done good; in a nation and time, where we are the ſmaller party, and conſequently moſt miſrepreſented, and moſt in need of vindication.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon, I took occaſion to mention the <hi>Superſtition</hi> of ſome ages after the ſubverſion of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which is too manifeſt a truth to be deny'd, and does in no ſort reflect upon the preſent profeſſors of our faith who are free from it. Our ſilence in theſe points may with ſome reaſon make our adverſaries think we allow and perſiſt in thoſe bigottries; which yet in reality all good and ſenſible Men deſpiſe, tho' they are perſuaded not to ſpeak againſt 'em; I can't tell why, ſince now 'tis no way the intereſt even of the worſt of our Prieſthood (as it might have been then) to have them ſmother'd in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: For as the oppoſite Sects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being ſlander'd; 'tis our buſineſs now to ſhow it is ſlander'd unjuſtly, and to vindicate ourſelves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with. This can't ſo well be brought about with ſerious faces; we muſt laugh with them at what deſerves it; and then we need not doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>

As to particulars: you cannot but have obſerv'd that at firſt the whole objection againſt the ſimile of wit and faith lay to the word <hi>They:</hi> When that was beyond contradiction removed (the very Grammar ſerving to confute 'em) then the objection lies againſt the <hi>Simile itſelf;</hi> or if that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile will not be objected to (ſenſe and common reaſon being indeed a little ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and not apt to give way to every body) next the mention of <hi>Superſtition</hi> muſt become a crime (as if <hi>Religion</hi> and ſhe were ſiſters, or that it were a ſcandal upon the family of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſay a word againſt the Devil's baſtard.) Afterwards, more miſchief is diſcover'd in a place that ſeem'd innocent at firſt, the two lines about <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,</hi> at the bottom of page 24. An or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man wou'd imagine the author plainly declar'd againſt thoſe ſchiſmatics, for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the underſtanding of ſome few of its believers: But theſe believers are call'd <hi>Dull,</hi> and becauſe I ſay that <hi>thoſe Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics</hi> think <hi>ſome</hi> believers <hi>dull,</hi> therefore theſe charitable interpreters of my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will have it, that <hi>I</hi> think <hi>all</hi> believers dull.

and I have cauſe to know that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's fault (if he has any) is not want of zeal: He put a notion into my head, which I confeſs I can't but perfectly acquieſce in; that when a ſett of people are piqu'd at any truth which they think to their own diſadvantage, their method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on the truth-ſpeaker is to attack his reputation a By-way, and not openly to object to the place they are really gall'd by: What theſe therefore (in his opinion) are in earneſt angry at, is, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> whom their tribe oppreſs'd and perſecuted ſhou'd be vindicated after an age of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy by one of their own people, willing to utter an honeſt truth in behalf of the dead, whom no man ſure will flatter, and to whom few will do juſtice. Others, you know, were as angry that I mention'd Mr. <hi>Walſh</hi> with honour; who as he never refuſed to any one of merit of any party the praiſe due to him, ſo honeſtly deſerv'd it from all others, tho' of ever ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent intereſts or ſentiments. May I be ever guilty of this ſort of liberty, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of principle! which gives us the hardineſs of ſpeaking well of thoſe whom envy oppreſſes ev'n after death. As I wou'd always ſpeak well of my living friends when they are abſent, nay becauſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0096900700:32"/>
they are abſent; ſo would I much more of the dead, in that eternal abſence; and the rather becauſe I expect no thanks for it.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee I do in my conſcience perſiſt in what I have written; yet in my friendſhip I will recant and alter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pleaſe, in caſe of a ſecond edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which I think the book will not ſo ſoon arrive at, for <hi>Tonſons</hi>'s printer told me he drew off a thouſand copies in this firſt impreſſion, and I fancy a treatiſe of this nature, which not one gentleman in three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore even of a liberal education can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, can hardly exceed the vent of that number.)

Methinks the Moraliſts and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending intirely either ſolitude, or publick life. In the former, men for the moſt part grow uſeleſs by too much reſt, and in the latter are deſtroy'd by too much precipitation; as waters lying ſtill, putrify and are good for nothing, and

               <p>YOU formerly obſerv'd to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the diſparity we often find in him ſick and well: Thus one of an unfortunate conſtitution is perpetually exhibiting a miſerable example of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to conſider myſelf in theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent views, and I hope have receiv'd ſome
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0096900700:43"/>
advantage by it, if what Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> ſays be true, that
<q>
                     <l>The ſoul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</l>
                     <l>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſurely ſickneſs, contributing no leſs than old age to the ſhaking down this ſcaffolding of the body, may diſcover the inward ſtructure more plainly. Sickneſs is a ſort of early old age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly ſtate, and inſpires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thouſand volumes of philoſophers and divines. It gives ſo warning a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion to thoſe props of our vanity, our ſtrength and youth, that we think of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ourſelves within, when there is ſo little dependance upon our out-works. Youth at the very beſt is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and ſmoother manner than age: 'Tis like a ſtream that nouriſhes a plant upon a bank, and cauſes it to flouriſh and bloſſom to the ſight, but at the ſame time is undermining it at the root in ſecret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me, it has afforded ſeveral Proſpects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0096900700:44"/>
world have nor dazzled me very much; and I begin where moſt people end, with a full conviction of the emptineſs of all ſorts of ambition, and the unſatisfactory nature of all human pleaſures. When a ſmart fit of ſickneſs tells me this ſcurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that honeſt <hi>Hibernian,</hi> who being in bed in the great ſtorm ſome years ago, and told the houſe would tumble over his head, made anſwer, What care I for the houſe? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the beſt time to die when one is in the beſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſo exceſſively weak as I now am I may ſay with conſcience, that I am not at all uneaſy at the thought that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men whom I never had any eſteem for, are likely to enjoy this world after me. When I reflect what an inconſiderable little atome every ſingle man is, with reſpect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a ſhame to be concern'd at the removal of ſuch a trivial animal as I am. The morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Exit, the ſun will riſe as bright as ever, the flowers ſmell as ſweet, the plants ſpring as green, the world will proceed in its old courſe, people will laugh as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and marry as faſt as they were us'd to do. The memory of man, (as it is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly expreſs'd in the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi>)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0096900700:45"/>

               <p>I Was the other day in company with five or ſix men of ſome learning; where chancing to mention the famous verſes which the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> ſpoke on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, they were all agreed that 'twas a piece of Gaiety unworthy of that Prince in thoſe circumſtances. I could not but differ from this opinion: Methinks it was by no means a gay, but a very ſerious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liloquy to his ſoul at the point of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; in which ſenſe I naturally took
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0096900700:46"/>
the verſes at my firſt reading them when I was very young, and before I knew what interpretation the world generally put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

               <p>I AM ſorry you publiſh'd that notion about <hi>Adrian</hi>'s <hi>Verſes</hi> as mine; ſhad I imagin'd you wou'd uſe my name, I ſhou'd have expreſs'd my ſentiments with more modeſty and diffidence.

But I think the ſuppoſition you draw from the notion of <hi>Adrian</hi>'s being addicted to Magick, is a little uncharitable, <q rend="inline">("that he might fear no ſort of Deity, good or bad")</q> ſince in the third verſe he plainly teſtifies his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a future ſtate, by being ſollicitous <hi>whither</hi> his ſoul was going? As to what you mention of his uſing gay and ludicrous expreſſions, I have owned my opinion to be that the expreſſions are not ſo, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0096900700:51"/>

               <p>YOU have at length comply'd with the requeſt I have often made you, for you have ſhown me, I muſt confeſs, ſeveral of my faults in the ſight of thoſe letters. Upon a review of them, I find
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0096900700:52"/>
many things that would give me ſhame, if I were not more deſirous to be thought honeſt than prudent: ſo many things freely thrown out, ſuch lengths of unreſerv'd friendſhip, thoughts juſt warm from the brain, without any poliſhing or dreſs, the very diſhabille of the underſtanding. You have prov'd yourſelf more tender of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's embryo's than the fondeſt mothers are of their own, for you have preſerv'd every thing that I miſcarry'd of. Since I know this, I ſhall in one reſpect be more afraid of writing to you than ever, at this careleſs rate, becauſe I ſee my evil works may again riſe in judgment againſt me: Yet in another reſpect I ſhall be leſs afraid, ſince this has given me ſuch a proof of the extreme indulgence you afford to my ſlighteſt thoughts. The reviſal of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters has been a kind of examination of conſcience to me; ſo fairly and faithfully have I ſet down in 'em from time to time the true and undiſtinguiſh'd ſtate of my mind. But I find that theſe, which were intended as sketches of my friendſhip, give as imperfect images of it, as the little landſcapes we commonly ſee in black and white, do of a beautiful country; they can repreſent but a very ſmall part of it, and that depriv'd of the life and luſtre of nature. I perceive that the more I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0096900700:53"/>
to render manifeſt the real affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and value I ever had for you, I did but injure it by repreſenting leſs and leſs of it: as glaſſes which are deſign'd to make an object very clear, generally contract it. Yet as when people have a full idea of a thing, firſt, upon their own knowledge, the leaſt traces of it ſerve to refreſh the remembrance, and are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing on that ſcore: So I hope the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge you had of my eſteem for you, is the reaſon that you do not diſlike my letters.</p>
               <p>They will not be of any great ſervice (I find) in the deſign I mentioned to you: I believe I had better ſteal from a richer man, and plunder your letters, (which I have kept as carefully as I would Letters Patents, ſince they intitle me to what I more value than titles of honour.) You have ſome cauſe to apprehend this uſage from me, if what ſome ſay be true, that I am a great Borrower; however I have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challeng'd me for it: and thoſe who ſay it are ſuch, whoſe writings no man ever borrow'd from, ſo have the leaſt reaſon to complain: Their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own.—Another has been pleaſed to declare, that my Verſes are corrected by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0096900700:54"/>
other men: I verily believe theirs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corrected by any man: But indeed, if mine have not, 'twas not my fault, I have endeavoured my utmoſt that they ſhould. But theſe things are only whiſpher'd, and I will not encroach upon <hi>Bays</hi>'s province and <hi>pen Whiſpers,</hi> ſo haſten to conclude</p>

               <p>THough any thing you write is ſure to be a pleaſure to me, yet I muſt own your laſt letter made me uneaſy: You real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe a ſtyle of compliment, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as little as I deſerve it. I know 'tis a common opinion that a young ſcribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth of a young Lady. From the moment one ſets up for an author, one muſt be treated as ceremoniouſly, that it is, as unfaithfully,
<q>
                     <l>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</l>
                  </q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which firſt makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb for life. But I muſt grant it is but a juſt judgment upon Poets, that they whoſe chief pretence is Wit, ſhou'd be treated juſt as they themſelves treat Fools, that is, be cajol'd with praiſes. And I believe, Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0096900700:57"/>
I would not be thought to ſay this, as if the obliging letter you ſent me deſerv'd this imputation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid of his Wife. <hi>It was not ſufficient that he knew her to be chaſt, himſelf, but ſhe ſhou'd not be ſo much as ſuſpected by others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the wonderful diſcoveries, and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of myſelf; I treat it as you who are in the Secret treat common news, groundleſs reports of things at a diſtance, which I who look into the true ſprings of the affair at home, in my own breaſt, know to have no foundation at all. For <hi>Fame</hi> tho' it be as <hi>Milton</hi> finely calls it, <hi>The laſt Infirmity of noble Minds,</hi> is ſcarce ſo ſtrong a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as to warrant our loſs of time here: It can never make us lie down contentedly on a death-bed (as ſome of the ancients are ſaid to have done with that thought.) You, Sir, have yourſelf taught me, that an eaſy ſituation at that hour, can proceed from no ambition leſs noble than that of an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by the ſtrongeſt endeavours of the Wit, but may be gain'd by the ſincere intentions of the Heart only. As in the next world, ſo in this, the only ſolid bleſſings are owing to the goodneſs of the mind, not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0096900700:58"/>
of the capacity: Friendſhip here is an emanation from the ſame ſource as Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude there: the ſame benevolence and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition that qualifies us for the one, if extended farther, makes us partakers of the other.

               <p>I Have been almoſt every day employ'd in following your advice, and amuſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Painting, in which I am moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0096900700:59"/>
obliged to Mr. <hi>Jervas,</hi> who gives me daily inſtructions and examples. As to poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs, I am content at preſent to be a bare looker-on, and from a practitioner turn an admirer, which is (as the world goes) not very uſual. <hi>Cato</hi> was not ſo much the wonder of <hi>Rome</hi> in his days, as he is of <hi>Britain</hi> in ours; and tho' all the fooliſh induſtry poſſible has been uſed to make it thought a Party-play, yet what the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor once ſaid of another may the moſt properly in the world be apply'd to him, on this occaſion.:
<q>
                     <l>Envy itſelf is dumb, in wonder loſt,</l>
                     <l>And Factions ſtrive, who ſhall applaud him moſt.</l>

               <p>The numerous and violent claps of the Whig-party on the one ſide of the theatre, were echo'd back by the Tories on the other; while the Author ſweated behind the ſcenes with concern, to find their applauſe proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the caſe too of the Prologue-writer, who was clapp'd into a ſtanch Whig, at almoſt ev'ry two lines. I believe you have heard, that after all the applauſes of the oppoſite Faction, my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> ſent for <hi>Booth</hi> who play'd <hi>Cato,</hi> into the box,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0096900700:60"/>
between one of the acts, and preſented him with fifty guineas; in acknowledgment (as he expreſt it) for defending the cauſe of <hi>Liberty</hi> ſo well againſt a <hi>Perpetual Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator.</hi> The Whigs are unwilling to be diſtanc'd this way, (as 'tis ſaid) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſign a preſent to the ſame <hi>Cato</hi> very ſpeedily; in the mean time they are get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ready as good a Sentence as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer on their ſide: So betwixt them, 'tis probable that <hi>Cato</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Garth</hi> expreſt it) <hi>may have ſomething to live upon, after he dies.</hi> I am</p>

To be uncenſur'd, and to be obſcure, is the ſame thing. You may conclude from what I here ſay, that 'twas never in my thoughts to have offer'd you my pen in any direct reply to ſuch a Critic, but only in ſome little raillery; not in defence of you, but in contempt of him.<note n="*" place="bottom">This relates to the Paper occaſion'd by <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Remarks upon <hi>Cato,</hi> call'd, Dr. <hi>Norris</hi>'s <hi>Narrative of the Frenzy of</hi> John Den . . .</note> But indeed your opinion, that 'tis intirely to be neglected, would have been my own, had it been my own caſe: but I felt more warmth here than I did when firſt I ſaw his book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt myſelf, (tho' indeed in two minutes it made me heartily merry.)

               <p>YOUR laſt is the more obliging, as it hints at ſome little niceties in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me, and which (ſo trivial as things of this nature ſeem) are yet of no ſlight conſequence, to people whom every body talks of, and every body as he pleaſes. 'Tis a ſort of Tax that attends an eſtate in <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the ſmall poſſeſſion an author holds. For indeed an author who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thanked for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſometimes ill-treated by thoſe very perſons that firſt debauch'd him. Yet to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way diſpleas'd that I have offended the violent of all Parties already; and at the ſame time I aſſure you conſcientiouſly, I feel not the leaſt malevolence or reſentment againſt any of thoſe who miſrepreſent me, or are diſſatisfied with me.

As I hope and would flatter myſelf, that you know me and my thoughts ſo entirely as never to be miſtaken in either, ſo 'tis a pleaſure to me that you gueſs'd ſo right in regard to the Author of that <hi>Guardian</hi> you mentioned. But I am ſorry to find it has taken air that I have ſome hand in thoſe Papers, becauſe I write ſo very few as neither to deſerve the credit of ſuch a report with ſome people, nor the diſrepute of it with others. An honeſt <hi>Jacobite</hi> ſpoke to me the ſenſe or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of the weak part of his Party ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fairly, that the good people took it ill of me, that I writ with <hi>Steele,</hi> tho' upon never ſo indifferent ſubjects—This I know you will laugh at as well as I do: yet I doubt not but many little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators and perſons of ſower diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will take occaſion hence to beſpatter me. I confeſs I ſcorn narrow ſouls, of all parties, and if I renounce my reaſon in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</p>
               <p>I can't imagine whence it comes to paſs that the few <hi>Guardians</hi> I have written are ſo generally known for mine: that in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular which you mention I never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to any man but the publiſher, till ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately: yet almoſt every body I met told me of it.</p>

The true reaſon that Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> laid down the Paper, was a quarrel between him and <hi>Jacob Tonſon.</hi> He ſtood engaged to his bookſeller, in articles of penalty, for all the <hi>Guardians;</hi> and by deſiſting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> was quit of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: theſe papers being printed by <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I cannot any way enter into that ſecret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the reſt of his politicks. Tho' 'tis ſaid, he will take into theſe papers alſo ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the politick kind, as before: But I aſſure you as to myſelf, I have quite done with 'em, for the future. The little I have done, and the great reſpect I bear Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> as a Man of Wit, has rendered me a ſuſpected Whig to ſome of the Violent, but (as old <hi>Dryden</hi> ſaid before me) 'Tis not the Violent I deſign to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>I generally employ the mornings in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mr. <hi>Jervas</hi>

               <p>I Have been lying in wait for my own imagination, this week and more, and watching what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy, that were worth communicating to you in a letter.

and truth, tho' never ſo low or vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, are yet pleaſing when openly and artleſsly repreſented; it would be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, to read the very letters of an infant, could it write its innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies and tautologies juſt as it thought 'em. This makes me hope a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from me will not be unwelcome to you, when I am conſcious I write with more unreſervedneſs than ever man wrote, or perhaps talk'd to another.

'Tis no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable proſpect to be reflecting, that ſo long a ſiege as that of <hi>Troy</hi> lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progreſs.

There are indeed, a ſort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, called Commentators and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their number and bulk, and perplex our progreſs under pretence of fortifying their author. Theſe lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themſelves have digged, encompaſſed with dirt of their own heaping up, but I think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more ſpeedy and gallant way than by mining under ground, that is, by uſing the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their heads.</p>
               <p>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find you are concern'd how I ſhall be paid, and are ſollicitous that I may not have the ill fate of many diſcarded Generals, to be firſt envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd, and laſtly neglected. The former (the

But if they can read (for I know ſome Critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſome ſpecimens of my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation from this Author in the <hi>Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,</hi> which they are heartily welcome to. I have met with as much malignity another way, ſome calling me a Tory, becauſe the heads of that party have been diſtinguiſhingly favourable to me; ſome a Whig, becauſe I have been favoured with yours, Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> his friendſhip, and of late with my Lord <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax</hi>'s Patronage. How much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a concluſion might be formed, by any good-natur'd man, that a perſon who has been well uſed by all ſides, has been offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to none. This miſerable age is ſo ſunk between animoſities of Party and thoſe of Religion, that I begin to fear, moſt men have politicks enough to make (thro' vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) the beſt Scheme of Government a bad one; and faith enough to hinder their own Salvation.

               <p>AS I take Ingratitude to be a greater crime than Impertinence, I chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to run the riſque of being thought guilty of the latter, than not to return
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0096900700:75"/>
you my thanks for a very agreeable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment you juſt now gave me. I have accidentally met with your <hi>Rape of the Lock here,</hi> having never ſeen it before. Style, Painting, Judgment, Spirit, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready admired in others of your Writings; but in this I am charmed with the magic of your <hi>Invention,</hi> with all thoſe images, alluſions, and inexplicable beauties, which you raiſe ſo ſurprizingly, and at the ſame time ſo naturally, out of a trifle. And yet I cannot ſay that I was more pleaſed with the reading of it, than I am with the pretext it gives me to renew in your thoughts the remembrance of one who values no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beyond the friendſhip of men of wit, learning and good nature.</p>
               <p>I remember to have heard you mention ſome half-formed deſign of coming to <hi>Italy.</hi> What might we not expect from a Muſe that ſings ſo well in the bleak climate of <hi>England,</hi> if ſhe felt the ſame warm Sun, and breath'd the ſame Air with <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are here an incredible number of Poets, that have all the inclination but want the genius, or perhaps the art, of the Ancients. Some among them who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> begin to reliſh our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and I am informed that at <hi>Florence</hi> they have tranſlated <hi>Milton</hi> into <hi>Italian</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0096900700:76"/>
Verſe. If one who knows ſo well how to write like the old <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, came among them, it wou'd probably be a means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve them from their cold, trivial conceits, to an imitation of their Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>As Merchants, Antiquaries, Men of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have all different views in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; I know not whether it might not be worth a Poet's while, to travel, in order to ſtore his mind with ſtrong Images of Nature.</p>
               <p>Green fields and groves, flow'ry meadows and purling ſtreams, are no where in ſuch perfection as in <hi>England:</hi> But if you wou'd know lightſome days, warm ſuns, and blue skies, you muſt come to <hi>Italy;</hi> and to enable a man to deſcribe rocks and precipices, it is abſolutely neceſſary that he paſs the <hi>Alps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will eaſily perceive that it is ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt makes me ſo fond of giving advice to one who has no need of it. If you came into theſe parts, I ſhou'd fly to ſee you. I am here (by the favour of my good friend the Dean of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s) in quality of Chaplain to the Earl of <hi>Peterborough;</hi> who about three months ſince left the greateſt part of his family in this town.

Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf with much indignation againſt me one evening at <hi>Button</hi>'s Coffee-houſe (as I was told) ſaying, That I was entered into a Cabal with Dean <hi>Swift</hi> and others to write againſt the <hi>Whig-Intereſt,</hi> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to undermine his own reputation, and that of his friends <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Addiſon.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> never open'd his lips to my face, on this or any like occaſion, tho' I was almoſt every night in the ſame room with him, nor ever offer'd me any indecorum. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> came to me a night or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Philips</hi> had talk'd in this idle manner, and aſſur'd me of his disbelief of what had been ſaid, of the friendſhip we ſhou'd always maintain, and deſir'd I wou'd ſay nothing further of it. My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> did me the honour to ſtir in this matter, by ſpeaking to ſeveral people to obviate a falſe aſperſion, which might have done me no ſmall preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice with one Party. However <hi>Philips</hi> did all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0096900700:78"/>
he could, ſecretly to continue the report with the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club, and kept in his hands the Subſcriptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it have ſince given him to underſtand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to be with a man whom I think a ſcoundrel) I wou'd not even ask him for this money, but commiſſioned one of the <hi>Players,</hi> his equals, to receive it. This is the whole matter; but as to the ſecret grounds of <hi>Philips</hi>'s malignity, they will make a very pleaſant Hiſtory when we meet. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> and ſome others have been much diverted with it, and moſt of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club have made it the ſubject of their ridicule on their Secretary. It is to this management of <hi>Philips,</hi> that the world owes Mr. <hi>Gay</hi>'s <hi>Paſtorals.</hi> The ingenious Author is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your ſervant, and would have comply'd with your kind invitation, but that he is juſt now appointed Secretary to my Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in his Embaſſy to <hi>Hanover.</hi>

               <p>YOU mention the account I gave you ſome time ago of the things which <hi>Philips</hi> ſaid in his fooliſhneſs; but I can't tell from any thing in your Letter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you receiv'd a long one from me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a fortnight ſince. It was principally intended to thank you for the laſt obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that reaſon you paſs it in ſilence. I there launched into ſome account of my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs, and intend now to give you ſome hints of my ſpiritual. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your Letter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you <hi>pray'd</hi> for me: Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of moſt other Friends, who never talk of praying for a Man after they have done
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0096900700:80"/>
him a ſervice, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human Sciences, which I aſſure you I am daily more and more convine'd of; and indeed I have for ſome years paſt, look'd upon all of 'em no better than amuſements. To make them the ultimate end of our purſuit, is a miſerable and ſhort ambition, which will drop from us at ev'ry little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments here, and even in caſe of no diſappointmentr here, will infallibly deſert us hereafter. The utmoſt fame they are capable of beſtowing, is never worth the pains they coſt us, and the time they loſe us. If you attain the top of your deſires that way, all thoſe who envy you will do you harm; and of thoſe who admire you, few will do you good. The unſucceſsful writers are your declared enemies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſucceſsful your ſecret ones: For thoſe hate not more to be excelled, than theſe to be rivalled. And at the upſhot, after a life of perpetual application, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that you have been doing nothing for yourſelf, and that the ſame or leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry might have gain'd you a Friendſhip that can never deceive or end, a ſatisfaction which praiſe cannot beſtow, nor vanity feel, and a glory which (tho' in one reſpect like ſame, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0096900700:81"/>
ſhall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. Theſe, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my ſentiments, whenever I think at all; for half the things that employ our heads deſerve not the name of thoughts they are only ſtronger dreams or impreſſions upon the imagination: Our ſchemes of government, our ſyſtems of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but ſo many ſhadowy images, and airy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, which ariſe to us but ſo much the livelier and more frequent, as we are more o'ercaſt with the darkneſs, and diſturb'd with the fumes of human vanity.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing that makes old men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long habit, and wearineſs of the ſame track. <hi>Homer</hi> will work a cure upon me; fifteen thouſand verſes are equivalent to fourſcore years, to make one old in Rhime: And I ſhou'd be ſorry and aſhamed, to go on jingling to the laſt ſtep, like a waggoner's horſe, in the ſame road, and ſo leave my <hi>Bells</hi> to the next ſilly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal that will be proud of 'em. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reaſon, who is meaſuring ſyllables and coupling rhimes, when he ſhould be mending his own Soul, and ſecuring his own immortality. If I had not this opinion, I ſhould be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy even of thoſe ſmall and limited parts

               <p>I Have no better excuſe to offer you, that I have omitted a task naturally ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me as converſing upon paper with you; but that my time and eyes have been wholly employ'd upon <hi>Homer,</hi> whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fear I ſhall find but one way of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is, in his blindneſs. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually afflicted with headach's, that very much affect my ſight; and indeed ſince my coming hither I have ſcarce paſſed an hour agreeably, except that in which I read your letter. I would ſeriouſly have you think, you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friendſhip, than he who leaſt deſerves it on all other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts than his due ſenſe of it. But let me tell you, you can hardly gueſs what a task you undertake, when you profeſs your ſelf my friend; there are ſome <hi>Tories</hi> who will take you for a <hi>Whig,</hi> ſome <hi>Whigs</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0096900700:83"/>
who will take you for a <hi>Tory,</hi> ſome <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> who will eſteem you a rank <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> who will account you a <hi>Heretick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be juſt to all men. The notions of right and wrong are ſo far ſtrain'd, that perhaps to be in the right ſo very violently, may be of worſe conſequence than to be eaſily and quietly in the wrong. I really wiſh all men ſo well, that I am ſatisfied but few can wiſh me ſo; but if thoſe few are ſuch as tell me they do, I am content, for they are the beſt people I know: While you believe me what I profeſs as to Religion, I can bear any thing the Bigotted may ſay; while Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> likes my poetry, I can endure <hi>Dennis</hi> and a thouſand more like him; while the moſt honeſt and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can eaſily ſupport it, tho' the moſt violent and mad of all parties roſe up to throw dirt at me.</p>
               <p>I muſt expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my <hi>Homer.</hi> Whoever in our times would be a profeſſor of learning above his fellows, ought at the very firſt to enter the world with the conſtancy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a primitive Chriſtian, and be prepared to ſuffer all ſorts of publick Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0096900700:84"/>
It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but endeavour to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf, or gratify others by his ſtudies, he is immediately treated as a common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, inſtead of being look'd upon as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend; and aſſaulted as generally, as if his whole deſign were to prejudice the State, and ruin the publick. I will venture to ſay, no man ever roſe to any degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in writing, but thro' obſtinacy and an inveterate reſolution againſt the ſtream of mankind: So that if the world has receiv'd any benefit from the labours of the Learned, it was in its own deſpite. For when firſt they eſſay their parts, all people in general are prejudiced againſt new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then ſome particular perſons who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unfortunate in their own attempts, are ſworn foes to them, only becauſe they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.—Upon the whole, one may ſay of the beſt writers, that they pay a ſevere fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the moſt worthleſs part of mankind to levy upon them when they pleaſe.</p>

I fancy no friendſhip is ſo likely to prove laſting as ours, becauſe I am pretty ſure there never was a friendſhip of ſo eaſy a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity we have, expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Artiſt you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope (piouſly hope) to hear theſe things. At home we follow our buſineſs, when we have any; and think and talk moſt of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friendſhip of a ſtay'd man and his wife, who are ſeldom ſo fond as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the buſineſs of the houſe from going on all day, or ſo indolent as not to find conſolation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the laſt, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantick friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, like violent loves, begin with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, proceed to jealouſies, and conclude in animoſities. I have liv'd to ſee the fierce advancement, the ſudden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of theſe enormous friendſhips, and am perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of a Maxim we once agreed in, That nothing hinders the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant agreement of people who live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0096900700:89"/>
but meer vanity; a ſecret inſiſting upon what they think their dignity or merit, and an inward expectation of ſuch an Over-meaſure of deference and regard, as anſwers to their own extravagant falſe ſcale; and which no body can pay, becauſe none but themſelves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts.</p>

               <p>WHatever ſtudies on the one hand, or amuſements on the other, it ſhall be my fortune to fall into, I ſhall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of 'em. The Task I undertook<note n="*" place="bottom">The Tranſlation of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliad.</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0096900700:90"/>
the place, than with the Books and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of it.</p>
               <p>I find ſtill more reaſon to complain of the negligence of the Geographers in their Maps of <hi>old Greece,</hi> ſince I look'd upon two or three more noted names in the publick libraries here. But with all the care I am capable of, I have ſome cauſe to fear the Engraver will prejudice me in a few ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I have been forced to write to him in ſo high a ſtyle, that were my epiſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, it would raiſe no ſmall admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in an ordinary man. There is ſcarce an order in it of leſs importance, than to remove ſuch and ſuch mountains, alter the courſe of ſuch and ſuch rivers, place a large city on ſuch a coaſt, and raze another in another country.

May I venture to ſay, who am a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and to ſay to you who are a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> that nothing is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing to me, than that people ſo greatly warm'd with a ſenſe of Liberty, ſhould be capable of harbouring ſuch weak Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that ſo much bravery and ſo much folly can inhabit the ſame breaſts?</p>
               <p>I could not but take a trip to <hi>London,</hi> on the death of the <hi>Queen,</hi> mov'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon curioſity of mankind, who leave their own buſineſs to be looking upon other mens. I thank God, that as for myſelf, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all the accidents of State-changes by my circumſtances, and above them by my phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. Common charity of man to man, and univerſal good will to all, are the points I have moſt at heart; and I am ſure thoſe are not to be broken for the ſake of any go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, or government. I am willing to hope the beſt, and what I more wiſh than my own or any particular man's advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, that this turn may put an end entirely to the diviſions of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory;</hi> that the parties may love each other as

well as I love them both; or at leaſt hurt each other as little as I would either; and that our own people may live as quietly as we ſhall certainly let theirs; that is to ſay, that want of <hi>power</hi> itſelf in us may not be a ſurer prevention of harm, than want of <hi>will</hi> in them. I am ſure, if all <hi>Whigs</hi> and all <hi>Tories</hi> had the ſpirit of one <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> that I know, it would be well for all <hi>Roman-Catholicks;</hi> and if all <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> had always had that ſpirit, it had been well for all others, and we had never been charged with ſo wicked a ſpirit as that of Perſecution.</p>
               <p>I agree with you in my ſentiment of the ſtate of our nation ſince this change: I find myſelf juſt in the ſame ſituation of mind you deſcribe as your own, heartily wiſhing the good, that is the quiet of my country, and hoping a total end of all the unhappy diviſions of mankind by party-ſpirit, which at beſt is but the madneſs of many for the gain of a few.</p>

He aſſur'd me that he wou'd make uſe not only of his intereſt, but of his art, to do you ſome ſervice; he did not mean his Art of Poetry, but his Art at Court; and he is ſenſible that nothing can have a better air for himſelf, than moving in your favour, eſpecially ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations were ſpread that he did not care you ſhould proſper too much as a Poet.

all is ſafe, and you are eſcap'd even in his opinion.

               <p>I Have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleas'd to ſpeak of me in a manner which nothing but the real reſpect I have for you can deſerve. May I hope that ſome late male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volencies have loſt their effect? Indeed it is neither for me, nor my enemies, to pretend to tell you whether I am your friend or not; but if you would judge by probabilities, I beg to know which of your poetical acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance has ſo little Intereſt in pretending to be ſo? Methinks no man ſhould queſtion the real friendſhip of one who deſires no real ſervice: I am only to get as much from the <hi>Whigs,</hi> as I got by the <hi>Tories,</hi> that is to ſay, Civility; being neither ſo proud as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of any good office, nor ſo humble, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0096900700:98"/>
not to dare heartily to deſpiſe any man who does me an injuſtice.</p>
               <p>I will not value myſelf upon having ever guarded all the degrees of reſpect for you; for (to ſay the truth) all the world ſpeaks well of you, and I ſhould be under a neceſſity of doing the ſame, whether I cared for you or not.</p>
               <p>As to what you have ſaid of me, I ſhall never believe that the Author of <hi>Cato</hi> can ſpeak one thing and think another. As a proof that I account you ſincere, I beg a favour of you: It is, that you would look over the two firſt books of my tranſlation of <hi>Homer,</hi> which are now in the hands of my Lord <hi>Halifax.</hi> I am ſenſible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it: 'tis therefore ſome evidence of the truſt I repoſe in your good will, when I give you this opportunity of ſpeaking ill of me with juſtice, and yet expect you will tell me your trueſt thoughts, at the ſame time that you tell others your moſt favourable ones.</p>
               <p>I have a farther requeſt, which I muſt preſs with earneſtneſs. My Bookſeller is reprinting the <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> to which you have done too much honour in your <hi>Spectator</hi> of N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 253.

is the only one I could wiſh omitted of all you have written: but I wou'd not deſire it ſhould be ſo, unleſs I had the merit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving your objection: I beg you but to point out thoſe ſtrokes to me, and you may be aſſured they ſhall be treated without mercy.</p>
               <p>Since we are upon proofs of ſincerity (which I am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each other's opinion) give me leave to name another paſſage in the ſame <hi>Spectator,</hi> which I wiſh you would alter It is where you mention an obſervation upon <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes of <hi>Syſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>'s Stone, <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe Words are ſince leſt out in Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s Edition, but were extant in all during Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Life.</note>

               <p>THE Farce of the <hi>What-d'ye-call it,</hi> has occaſioned many different ſpeculations in the town. Some look'd upon it as meer jeſt upon the tragic poets, others as a ſatire upon the late war. Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> hearing none of the words, and ſeeing the action to be tragical, was much aſtoniſhed to find the audience laugh; and ſays, the Prince and Princeſs muſt doubtleſs be under no leſs amazement on the ſame account. Several templers, and others of the more vociferous kind of criticks, went with a reſolution to hiſs, and confeſt they were forced to laugh ſo much, that they forgot the deſign they came with. The Court in general has in a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0096900700:105"/>
very particular manner come into the jeſt, and the three firſt Nights, (notwithſtanding two of them were court-nights) were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by very full audiences of the firſt quality. The common people of the pit and gallery receiv'd it at firſt with great gravity and ſedateneſs, ſome few with tears; but after the third day they alſo took the hint, and have ever ſince been very loud in their claps. There are ſtill ſome ſober men who cannot be of the general opinion, but the laughers are ſo much the majority, that one or two criticks ſeem determin'd to undeceive the town at their proper coſt, by writing grave diſſertations againſt it: To encourage them in which laudable deſign, it is reſolv'd a <hi>Preface</hi> ſhall be prefixt to the <hi>Farce,</hi> in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday Mr. <hi>Steele</hi>'s affair was decided: I am ſorry I can be of no other opinion than yours, as to his whole carriage and writings of late. But certainly he has not only been puniſh'd by others, but ſuffer'd much even from his own party in the point of character, nor (I believe) receiv'd any amends in that of intereſt, as yet; whatever may be his Proſpects for the future.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, among a thouſand others, is a great inſtance of the fate of all who are carried away by party-ſpirit, of any ſide. I wiſh all violence may ſucceed

               <p>IF your Mare could ſpeak, ſhe wou'd give you an account of the extraordinary company ſhe had on the road; which ſince ſhe cannot do, I will.</p>
               <p>It was the enterprizing Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> the redoubtable rival of Mr. <hi>Tonſon,</hi> who moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a ſtonehorſe, (no diſagreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to your Lordſhip's mare) overtook me in <hi>Windſor-foreſt.</hi> He ſaid, he heard I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for <hi>Oxford,</hi> the ſeat of the muſes, and would, as my bookſeller, by all means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me thither.</p>
               <p>I ask'd him where he got his horſe? He anſwered, he got it of his publiſher: <q rend="inline">"For that rogue my printer, (ſaid he) diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

me: I hoped to put him in good humour by a treat at the tavern, of a brown fricaſſee of rabbits which coſt two ſhillings, with two quarts of wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my converſation. I thought myſelf cockſure of his horſe, which he readily promiſed me, but ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> had juſt ſuch another deſign of going to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> expecting there the copy of <hi>a Comment upon the Revelations;</hi> and if Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> went, he was preingaged to attend him, being to have the printing of the ſaid copy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>So in ſhort, I borrow'd this ſtonehorſe of my publiſher, which he had of Mr. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixon</hi> for a debt; he lent me too the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty boy you ſee after me; he was a ſmutty dog yeſterday, and coſt me near two hours to waſh the ink off his face: but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very forward in his catechiſe: if you have any more bags, he ſhall carry them.</p>
               <p>I thought Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>'s civility not to be neglected, ſo gave the boy a ſmall bagg, containing three ſhirts and an Elvezir <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil;</hi> and mounting in an inſtant proceeded on the road, with my man before, my courteous ſtationer beſide, and the aforeſaid Devil behind.</p>

               <p>I Am writing you a long letter, but all the tediouſneſs I feel in it is, that it makes me during the time think more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently of my being far from you. I fancy if I were with you, I cou'd remove ſome of the uneaſineſs which you may have felt from the oppoſition of the world, and which you ſhould be aſhamed to feel, ſince it is but the teſtimony which one part of it gives you that your merit is unqueſtionable: What wou'd you have otherwiſe from ignorance, envy, or thoſe tempers which vie with you in your own way? I know this in mankind, that when our ambition is unable to attain its end, it is not only wearied, but exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated too at the vanity of its labours; then we ſpeak ill of happier ſtudies, and ſighing condemn the excellence which we find above our reach.—</p>

aſſure you of the continuance of that eſteem and affection I have long borne you, and the memory of ſo many agreeable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations as we have paſſed together. I wiſh it were a compliment to ſay ſuch converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are not to be found on this ſide of the Water: for the ſpirit of Diſſenſion is gone forth among us nor is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Button</hi>'s is no longer <hi>Button</hi>'s when <hi>Old England</hi> is no longer <hi>Old England,</hi> that region of hoſpitality, ſociety, and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Party affects us all, even the wits, tho' they gain as little by politicks as they do by their wit. We talk much of fine ſenſe, refined ſenſe, and exalted ſenſe; but for uſe and happineſs give me a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. I ſay this in regard to ſome gentlemen, profeſſed wits of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who fancy they can make Poetry of conſequence at this time of day, in the midſt of this raging fit of Politicks. For they tell me, the buſy part of the nation are not more divided about <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> than theſe idle fellows of the Feather about Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s and my Tranſlation. I (like the <hi>Tories</hi>) have the town in general, that is the mob, on my ſide; but 'tis uſual with the ſmaller Party to make up in induſtry what they want in number, and that's the caſe with the little Senate of <hi>Cato.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if our principles be well conſidered, I

We have, it ſeems, a great <hi>Turk</hi> in Poetry, who can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bear a Brother on the throne; and has his Mutes too, a ſett of Nodders, Winkers, and Whiſperers, whoſe buſineſs is to ſtrangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth. The new Tranſlator of <hi>Homer</hi> is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſlave he has, that is to ſay, his firſt Miniſter; let him receive the honours he gives him, but receive them with fear and trembling: let him be proud of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his abſolute Lord; I appeal to the People, as my rightful judges and maſters; and if they are not inclined to condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flying proceedings from the ſmall Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at <hi>Button</hi>'s.

But others are of opinion it has been longer among you, and was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced much about the ſame time with <hi>Frogs,</hi> and with equal Succeſs Poor <hi>Poetry!</hi> the little that's left of it here longs to croſs the Seas, and leave <hi>Euſden</hi> in full and peaceable Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel:

And we begin to wiſh you had the ſinging of our Poets, as well as the croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Frogs, to yourſelves in <hi>Saecula Saeculorum.</hi> It would be well in exchange, if <hi>Parnelle,</hi> and two or three more of your Swans, would come hither, eſpecially that Swan, who like a true modern one, does not ſing at all, Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> I am (like the reſt of the World) a Sufferer by his Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Indeed I hate that any Man ſhould be idle, while I muſt tranſlate and comment: And I may the more ſincerely wiſh for good Poetry from others, becauſe I am become a perſon out of the queſtion; for a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator is no more a Poet, than a Taylor is a Man.</p>

               <p>THAT you have not heard from me of late, aſcribe not to the uſual lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Correſpondent, but to a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where your name is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with honour, even in a land flowing with Tories. I had the good fortune there to be often in the converſation of Doctor <hi>Clarke:</hi> He entertained me with ſeveral Drawings, and particularly with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſigns of <hi>Inigo Jones</hi>'s <hi>Whitehall.</hi> I there ſaw and reverenced ſome of your firſt Pieces; which future Painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the <hi>Culex</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Batrachom</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having named this latter piece, give me leave to ask what is become of Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and his Frogs? <hi>Oblitusque meorum, obliviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendus &amp; illis,</hi> might be <hi>Horace</hi>'s wiſh, but will never be mine, while I have ſuch <hi>meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums</hi> as Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> I hope the ſpring will reſtore you to us, and with you all the beauties and colours of nature. Not but I congratulate you on the pleaſure you muſt take in being admired in your own Country, which ſo ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to Prophets and Poets. But in this you
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0096900700:133"/>
have the Advantage of Poets; you are Maſter of an Art that muſt proſper and grow rich, as long as people love, or are proud of themſelves, or their own perſons. However, you have ſtay'd long enough, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, to have painted all the numberleſs Hiſtories of old <hi>Ogygiae.</hi> If you have begun to be Hiſtorical, I recommend to your hand the ſtory which every pious <hi>Iriſhman</hi> ought to begin with, that of St. <hi>Patrick:</hi> To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. <hi>P.</hi> was, when he tranſlated the <hi>Batrachomuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia</hi>) to come into <hi>England</hi> to copy the Frogs, and ſuch other Vermine as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen in that land ſince the time of that Confeſſor.</p>
               <p>I long to ſee you a Hiſtory Painter. You have already done enough for the Private, do ſomething for the Publick; and be not confined, like the reſt, to draw only ſuch ſilly ſtories as our own faces tell of us. The Ancients too expect you ſhould do them right; thoſe Statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make them truly known to all nations, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you intend to write of their <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> I hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble deſign.</p>
               <p>As to your enquiry about your Houſe, when I come within the walls, they put
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0096900700:134"/>
me in mind of thoſe of <hi>Carthage</hi> where your Friend, like the wandring <hi>Trojan,</hi>

                     <l>Animum Pictura paſcit inani.</l>
                  </q>
For the ſpacious Manſion, like a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Caravanſerah, entertains the Vagabond with only bare Lodging. I rule the Family very ill, keep bad Hours, and lend out your Pictures about the Town. See what it is to have a Poet in your Houſe! <hi>Frank</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does all he can in ſuch a Circumſtance, for conſidering he has a wild Beaſt in it, he conſtantly keeps the Door chain'd. Every time it is open'd, the Links rattle, the ruſty Hinges roar, the Houſe ſeems ſo ſenſible that you are its ſupport, that it is ready to drop in your Abſence; but I ſtill truſt my ſelf under its Roof, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Providence will preſerve ſo many <hi>Raphaels, Titian</hi> and <hi>Guido's,</hi> as are lodg'd in your Cabinet. Surely the Sins of one Poet can hardly be ſo heavy, as to bring an old Houſe over the Heads of ſo many Painters. In a word, your Houſe is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but what of that?

               <p>LAST poſt brought me the favour of your letter of the 10th <hi>Aug. O. S.</hi> It would be taking too much upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, that 'twas a Witty one; I never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to more judgment than to know what pleaſes me, and can aſſure you, it was a very Agreeable one. The proof I can give you of my ſincerity in this Opinion, is, that I hope and deſire you would not ſtop at this, but continue more of them.</p>
               <p>I am in a place where Pleaſure is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually flowing. The Princes ſet the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the Subjects follow at a diſtance. The Ladies are of all parties, by which means the converſation of the Men is very much ſoftened and faſhioned from thoſe blunt diſputes on Politicks, and rough Jeſts, we are ſo guilty of, while the Freedom of the Women takes away all Formality and Conſtraint. I muſt own, at the ſame time, theſe Beauties are a little too artificial for my Taſte; you have ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Picture, the Original is more painted, and ſuch a cruſt of Powder and eſſence in their Hair, that you can ſee no difference between
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0096900700:136"/>
black and red. By diſuſing Stays, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging themſelves at a Table, they are run out of all Shape; but as to that, they may give a good reaſon, they prefer Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to Parade, and are by this means as ready, as they are generally willing to be Charitable.</p>
               <p>I am ſurpriz'd to find I have wrote ſo much Scandal; I fancy I am either ſetting up for a Wit, or imagine I muſt write in this Style to a Wit; I hope you'll prove a good natured one, and not only let me hear from you ſometimes, but forgive the ſmall Encouragement you meet with.

               <p>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with a Letter, but was diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged for want of ſomething that I could think worth ſending fifteen hundred Miles. <hi>Italy</hi> is ſuch an exhauſted Subject, that, I dare ſay, you'd eaſily forgive my ſaying nothing of it; and the imagination of a Poet is a thing ſo nice and delicate, that it is no eaſy matter to find out Images capable of giving Pleaſure to one of the few, who (in any Age) have come up to that Character. I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs lately returned from an Iſland, where I paſſed three or four Months, which, were it ſet out in its true Colours, might methinks amuſe you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The Iſland <hi>Inarime</hi> is an Epitome of the whole Earth, containing within the compaſs of eighteen Miles, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful variety of Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains, and barren Mountains, all thrown together in a moſt romantic Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0096900700:138"/>
The Air is in the hotteſt Seaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly refreſhed by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales produce excellent Wheat and <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, but are moſtly covered with Vineyards, intermixt with Fruit-trees. Beſides the common kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Peaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they produce Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Limes, Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Melons, and many other Fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our Climates, which lie every where open to the Paſſenger. The Hills are the greater part covered to the top with Vines, ſome with Cheſnut Groves, and others with thickets of Myrtle and Lentiſcus. The Fields on the Northern ſide are divided by hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Landſcape, which is likewiſe ſet off by the variety of ſome barren Spots, and naked Rocks. But that which crowns the Scene, is a large Mountain, riſing out of the middle of the Iſland (once a terrible <hi>Volcano,</hi> by the Ancients called <hi>Mons Epomeus</hi>) its lower parts are adorned with Vines and other Fruits, the middle affords Paſture to flocks of Goats and Sheep, and the top is a ſandy pointed Rock, from which you have the fineſt Proſpect in the World, ſurveying at one view, beſides ſeveral pleaſant Iſlands lying at your Feet, a tract of <hi>Italy</hi> about three hundred Miles in length, from the Promontory of <hi>Antium,</hi> to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0096900700:139"/>
he Cape of <hi>Palinurus.</hi> The greater part of which hath been ſung by <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as making a conſiderable part of the Travels and Adventures of their two Heroes. The Iſlands <hi>Caprea, Prochyta,</hi> and <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi> together with <hi>Cajeta, Cumae, Monte, Miſeno,</hi> the Habitations of <hi>Circe,</hi> the <hi>Syrens,</hi> and the <hi>Leſtrigones,</hi> the Bay of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Promontory of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and the whole <hi>Campagnia felice,</hi> make but a part of this noble Landſcape; which would demand an Imagination as warm, and numbers as flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as your own, to deſcribe it. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this delicious Iſle, as they are without Riches and Honours, ſo are they without the Vices and Follies that attend them; and were they but as much ſtrangers to Revenge, as they are to Avarice or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, they might in fact anſwer the poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notions of the Golden Age. But they have got, as an alloy to their Happineſs, an ill habit of murdering one another on flight Offences. We had an Inſtance of this the ſecond Night after our Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being ſhot dead by our Door: And yet by the ſole ſecret of minding our own buſineſs, we found a means of living ſecurely among theſe dangerous People. Would you know how we paſs the time at <hi>Naples?</hi> Our chief Entertainment is the Devotion of our Neighbours. Beſides the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0096900700:140"/>
gayety of their Churches (where Folks go to ſee what they call <hi>una Bella Devotione</hi> (i. e.) a ſort of Religious Opera) they make Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works almoſt every Week out of Devotion; the Streets are often hung with Arras out of Devotion; and (what is ſtill more ſtrange) the Ladies invite Gentlemen to their Houſes, and treat them with Muſick and Sweetmeats, out of Devotion; in a word, were it not for this Devotion of its inhabitants, <hi>Naples</hi> would have little elſe to recommend it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Air and Situation. Learning is in no very thriving ſtate here, as indeed no where elſe in <hi>Italy.</hi> However, among many pretenders, ſome Men of taſte are to be met with. A Friend of mine told me not long ſince, that being to viſit <hi>Salvini</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> he found him reading your <hi>Homer.</hi> He liked the Notes extreamly, and could find no other fault with the Verſion, but that he thought it approached too near a Paraphraſe; which ſhews him not to be ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our Language. I wiſh you Health to go on with that noble Work, and when you have that, I need not wiſh you Succeſs.

               <p>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to ſee and converſe with a Man, whom in his Writings I had ſo long known with Pleaſure: But it was a high addition to it, to hear you, at our very firſt meeting, doing juſtice to your dead friend Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> I was not ſo happy as to know him; <hi>Virgilium tantum vidi</hi>—Had I been born early enough, I muſt have known and lov'd him: For I have been aſſur'd, not only by your ſelf, but by Mr.

                  <hi>Congreve</hi> and Sir <hi>William Trumbul,</hi> that his perſonal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwithſtanding the many libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miſrepreſentations of them, (againſt which the former of theſe Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him<note n="*" place="bottom">He ſince did ſo, in his Dedication to the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> prefix'd to <hi>Tonſon</hi>'s <hi>Duodecimo</hi> Edition of <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Plays, 1717.</note>.) I ſuppoſe thoſe Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his ſucceſs and fame: And thoſe Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times, were only like Gnats in a Summer's Evening, which are never very troubleſome but in the fineſt and moſt glorious Seaſon; (for his Fire, like the Sun's, ſhin'd cleareſt towards its ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.)</p>
               <p>You muſt not therefore imagine, that when you told me of my own Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances that they were above thoſe Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, I was ſo vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be ſo humble as to think my ſelf quite below their Notice. For Critics, as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination to Carrion: And though ſuch poor Writers as I, are but Beggars, however no Beggar is ſo poor but he can keep a Cur, and no Author is ſo beggarly but he can keep a Critic.

Our Wit (as you call it)is but Reflection or Imitation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcarce to be call'd ours. True Wit, I believe, may be defin'd Juſtneſs of Thought, and a Facility of Expreſſion; or (in the Midwives Phraſe) a perfect Conception, with an eaſy Delivery. However this is far from a compleat Definition; pray help me to a better, as I doubt not you can.</p>

to it, whilſt they forget to pay their more private and particular, as more juſt Debts, to their beſt and neareſt Friends. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope, you who have as much Good-Nature as Good Senſe, (ſince they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are Companions) will have Patience with a Debtor, who you think has an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to pay you his Obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time ſhould conſider when you have oblig'd me beyond my preſent Power of returning the Favour, that a Debtor may be an honeſt Man, if he but intends to be juſt when he is able, tho' late. But I ſhould be leſs juſt to you, the more I thought I could make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to ſo much Profuſeneſs of Wit and Humanity together; which though they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom accompany each other, in other Men, are in you ſo equally met, I know not in which you moſt abound.

               <p>Therefore I will ſay no more now of them, than that your good Wit ne'er for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited your good Judgment, but in your Partiality to me and mine; ſo that if it

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0096900700:151"/>
Patience beforehand; for if it proves the longeſt, it will be of courſe the worſt I have troubled you with. Yet to expreſs my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter, is not more my Duty than my Intereſt; as ſome People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindneſs, to put you in mind of beſtowing another. The more favourable you are to me, the more diſtinctly I ſee my Faults; Spots and Blemiſhes, you know, are never ſo plainly diſcover'd as in the brighteſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine. Thus I am mortified by thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations which were deſign'd to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me: for Praiſe to a young Wit, is like Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately beſtow'd, it chears and revives; but if too laviſhly, overcharges and depreſſes him. Moſt Men in years, as they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſcouragers of Youth, are like old Trees, that being paſt Bearing themſelves, will ſuffer no young Plants to flouriſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them: But as if it were not enough to have out-done all your Coaevals in Wit, you will excel them in Good-Nature too. As for my <note n="a" place="bottom">His <hi>Paſtorals,</hi> written at 16 Years of Age.</note>green Eſſays, if you find any pleaſure in 'em, it muſt be ſuch as a Man naturally takes in obſerving the firſt Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he

has rais'd himſelf: and 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be eſteem'd any otherwiſe, than as we value Fruits for being early, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs are the moſt inſipid, and the worſt of the Year. In a word, I muſt blame you for treating me with ſo much Compliment, which is at beſt but the Smoak of Friendſhip. I neither write, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you, to gain your Praiſe, but your Affection. Be ſo much my Friend as to appear my Enemy, and tell me my Faults, if not as a young Man, at leaſt as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd Writer.</p>

               <p>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of <hi>March</hi> I have received, which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country, tho' it were one's Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity, or Juſtice, for giving you your Due; who ſhou'd not let your Modeſty be ſo unjuſt to your Merit, as to reject
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0096900700:153"/>
what is due to it, and call that Compliment which is ſo ſhort of your deſert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (as you ſay) however you muſt allow there is no Smoak but there is ſome Fire; and as the Sacrifice of Incenſe offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half ſo ſweet to others, if it had not been for its Smoak; ſo Friendſhip, like Love, cannot be without ſome Incenſe, to perfume the Name it would praiſe and immortalize. But ſince you ſay you do not write to me to gain my <hi>Praiſe,</hi> but my <hi>Affection,</hi> pray how is it poſſible to have the one without the other? We muſt admire beſore we love. You affirm, you would have me ſo much your Friend as to appear your Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections: But (my Friend) that would be ſo hard to do, that I who love no Difficulties, can't be perſuaded to it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Vanity of a Scribler is ſuch, that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's; eſpecially when he muſt take pains to do it: And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion, when you talk of any Thing, or Man but your ſelf, I cannot ſuffer you to murther your Fame, with your own hand, without oppoſing you; eſpecially when you ſay your laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

As to my enquiry after your Intrigues with the <hi>Muſes,</hi> you may allow me to make it, ſince no old Man can give ſo young, ſo great, and able a Favourite of theirs, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.

               <p>I Cannot contend with you. You muſt give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments, and to collect only this in general from 'em, that your Deſign is to encourage me. But I ſeparate from all the reſt that Paragraph or two, in which you make me ſo warm an Offer of your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Were I poſſeſs'd of That, it would put an end to all thoſe Speeches with which you now make me bluſh; and change them to wholeſome Advices, and free Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, which might make me wiſer and happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion, that Friendſhip is beſt contracted betwixt Perſons of equal Age: but I have ſo much Intereſt to be of another Mind, that you muſt pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine, in oppoſition to that Opinion.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place 'tis obſervable, that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally cauſed by our finding the ſame Diſpoſitions in them, which we feel in our ſelves. This is but Self-love at the bottom: Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be ſuch, the Inclinations of ſuch
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0096900700:157"/>
being commonly various. The Friendſhip of two young Men is often occaſioned by Love of Pleaſure or Voluptuouſneſs, each being deſirous, for his own ſake, of one to aſſiſt or incourage him in the Courſes he purſues; as that of two old Men is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the ſcore of ſome Profit, Lucre, or Deſign upon others. Now, as a young Man who is leſs acquainted with the Ways of the World, has in all probability leſs of Intereſt; and an old Man who may be weary of himſelf, leſs of Self-love; ſo the Friendſhip between them is the more likely to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard. One may add to this, that ſuch a Friendſhip is of greater Uſe and Advantage to both; for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to pleaſe the young one; and the young Man more diſcreet and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the help of the old one: ſo it may prove a Cure of thoſe epidemical Diſeaſes of Age and Youth, Sourneſs and Madneſs. I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Poſſibility of this; One alone abundantly ſatisfies me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to the very Heart; which is, that <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> was at this time about Seventy Years old, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> under Seventeen.</note>

               <p>I Shou'd believe my ſelf happy in your good Opinion, but that you treat me ſo much in a Style of Compliment. It has been obſerv'd of Women, that they are more ſubject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being generally treated this way; but the weakeſt Women are not more ſo than that weak Claſs of Men, who are thought to pique them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Wit. The World is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanting, when a Coxcomb is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing himſelf, to help to give him the finiſhing Stroke.</p>
               <p>Every Man is apt to think his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour overſtock'd with Vanity, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but fancy, there are certain Times, when moſt people are in a diſpoſition of being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a vaſt Good a little Truth might do, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſuch ſeaſons. A very ſmall Alms will do a great kindneſs, to people in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0096900700:159"/>
I could name an acquaintance of yours, who wou'd at this time think himſelf more oblig'd to you for the Information of his Faults, than the Confirmation of his Follies. If you would make thoſe the Subject of a Letter, it might be as long as I could wiſh your Letters always were.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder you have hitherto found ſome difficulty (as you are pleas'd to ſay) in writing to me, ſince you have always choſen the Task of commending me: Take but the other way, and I dare ingage you will find none at all.</p>
               <p>As for my Verſes which you praiſe ſo much, I may truly ſay they had never been the cauſe of any Vanity in me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what they gave me when they firſt occaſion'd my acquaintance with you. But I have ſeveral times ſince been in danger of this Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain, the greateſt magnifying Glaſſes in the World are a Man's own Eyes, when they look upon his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet even in thoſe, I cannot fancy my ſelf ſo extremely like <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> as you wou'd perſuade me: If I muſt be like him, 'tis you will make me ſo,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0096900700:160"/>
by complimenting me into a better opinion of my ſelf than I deſerve: They made him think he was the <hi>Son of Jupiter,</hi> and you aſſure me I am a Man of Parts. But is this all you can ſay to my honour? You ſaid ten times as much before, when you call'd me your Friend. After having made me believe I poſſeſs'd a ſhare in your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to treat me with Compliments and ſweet Sayings, is like the proceeding with poor <hi>Sancho 'Panca:</hi> They had perſuaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion, and then gave him nothing to ſubſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but <hi>Wafers</hi> and <hi>Marmalade.</hi> In our Days, the greateſt obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him. For as when Madmen are found incurable, wiſe Men give them their Way, and pleaſe them as well as they can; ſo when thoſe incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably Be-Mus'd, the beſt way both to quiet them, and ſecure your ſelves from the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their Vanity; (which indeed for the moſt part is all that is fed in a Poet.)</p>
               <p>You may believe me, I could be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily glad that all you ſay were as true, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to me, as it wou'd be to your ſelf, for ſeveral weighty Reaſons; but for none ſo much, as that I might be to you what you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0096900700:161"/>
deſerve; whereas I can now be no more, than is conſiſtent with the ſmall, tho' ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Capacity of,</p>

               <p>I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from the Town to the Country; from <hi>Will</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe to <hi>Windſor</hi> Foreſt. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Town-Wits, and the downright Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fools; that the firſt are pertly in the Wrong, with a little more Flouriſh and Gaiety, and the laſt neither in the Right nor the Wrong, but confirmed in a ſtupid, ſettled Medium betwixt both. However, methinks theſe are moſt in the Right, who quietly and eaſily reſign themſelves over to the gentle Reign of Dulneſs, which the Wits muſt do at laſt, tho' after a great deal of Noiſe, Pother, and Reſiſtance. Ours are a ſort of modeſt, inoffenſive People, who neither have Senſe, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulneſs. They are commonly known in the World by the Name of honeſt, civil Gentlemen. They live much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting Life, purſuing with earneſtneſs and hazard, ſomething not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but preſer Solitude to the Company of all theſe; for tho' a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0096900700:163"/>
Man's ſelf may poſſibly be the worſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to converſe with in the world, yet one would think the Company of a Perſon whom we have the greateſt regard to, and affection for, could not be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant: As a Man in love with a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, deſires no converſation but hers, ſo a Man in love with himſelf, (as moſt Men are) may be beſt pleaſed with his own. Beſides, if the trueſt and moſt uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, be the Knowledge of our ſelves, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude conducing moſt to make us look into our ſelves, ſhould be the moſt inſtructive State of Life. We ſee nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, than Men, who for the ſake of the circumſtantial Part, and meer outſide of Life, have been half their Days rambling out of their Nature, and ought to be ſent into Solitude to ſtudy themſelves over again. People are uſually ſpoil'd inſtead of being taught, at their coming into the World; whereas by being more converſant with Obſeurity, without any Pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a Man be a Coxcomb, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is his beſt School; and if he be a Fool, it is his beſt Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Theſe are good Reaſons for my own Stay here, but I wiſh I could give you any for your coming hither, except that I earneſtly invite you. And yet I can't help
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0096900700:164"/>
ſaying, I have ſuffered a great deal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content that you do not, tho' I ſo little merit that you ſhould.</p>

               <p>YOURS of the 26th of <hi>October</hi> I have received, as I have always done yours, with no little Satisfaction, and am proud to diſcover by it, that you find fault with the ſhortneſs of mine, which I think the beſt Excuſe for it: And tho' they (as you ſay) who have moſt Wit or Money, are moſt ſparing of either; there are ſome who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Poor to be thought Rich, and are Poor, which is my Caſe: I cannot but rejoice, that you have undergone ſo much diſcontent for want of my company; but if you have a mind to puniſh me for my fault, (which I could not help) defer your coming to Town, and you will do it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.

deſpair of ſeeing you, who, in return to your inviting me to your Foreſt, invite you to my Foreſt, the Town; where the Beaſts that inhabit, tame or wild, of long Ears or Horns, purſue one another either out of Love or Hatred. You may have the Pleaſure to ſee one Pack of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds purſue another Herd of Brutes, to bring each other to their Fall, which is their whole Sport: Or, if you affect a leſs bloody Chace, you may ſee a Pack of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels, called <hi>Lovers,</hi> in a hot purſuit of a two legg'd <hi>Vixen,</hi> who only flies the whole low'd Pack to be ſingled out by one Dog, who runs mute to catch her up the ſooner from the reſt, as they are making a Noiſe, to the Loſs of their Game. In fine, this is the Time for all ſorts of Sport in the Town, when thoſe of the Country ceaſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave your Foreſt of Beaſts, for ours of Brutes, call'd Men, who now in full Cry, (pack'd by the Court or Country) run down in the Houſe of Commons, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted horned Beaſt of the Court, to the ſatisfaction of their Spectators: Beſides, (more for your Diverſion) you may ſee not only the two great Play-houſes of the Nation, thoſe of the Lords and Commons, in Diſpute with one another; but the two other Play-houſes in high Conteſt, becauſe the Members of one Houſe are remov'd

               <p>I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter, with my Paper<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame which was printed in the Year 1717, in a <hi>Miſcellany</hi> of <hi>Bern. Lintot</hi>'s, and in the preſent Edition of the Poſthumous Works of Mr. <hi>Wycherley.</hi>
                  </note> to Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> corrected. I own you have made more of it by making it leſs, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> are ſaid to burn half the Spices they bring home to inhance the Price of the remainder, ſo to be greater Gainers by their Loſs, (which is indeed my Caſe now.) Well; you have prun'd my ſading Laurels of ſome ſuperfluous, ſapleſs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0096900700:167"/>
and dead Branches, to make the remainder live the longer; thus like your Maſter <hi>Apollo,</hi> you are at once a Poet and a Phyſician.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation of you to the Town, your Good-Nature was the firſt Cauſe of my confident requeſt; but excuſe me, I muſt I ſee ſay no more upon this Subject, ſince I find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with: tho' you have given me ſome Encouragement to hope, our Friendſhip tho' young might be without Shyneſs, or criminal Modeſty; for a Friend, like a Miſtreſs, tho' he is not to be mercenary to be true, yet ought not to refuſe a Friend's kindneſs becauſe it is ſmall or trivial: I have told you (I think) that a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady ſaid to her poor, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Gallant, that a Queen if ſhe lay with a Groom, would expect a mark of his kindneſs from him, tho' it were but his Curry-comb. But you and I will diſpute this Matter when I am ſo happy as to ſee you here; and perhaps 'tis the only Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in which I might hope to have the better of you.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, to make you another excuſe for my boldneſs in inviting you to Town, I deſign'd to leave with you ſome more of my Papers, (ſince theſe return ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of your Hands than they went from mine) for I intended (as I told you formerly)

               <p>BY yours of the laſt Month, you deſire me to ſelect, if poſſible, ſome Things from the <note n="†" place="bottom">Printed in <hi>Folio,</hi> in the Year 1704.</note>firſt Volume of your Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, which may be alter'd ſo as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again. I doubted your meaning in this; whether it was to pick out the beſt of thoſe Verſes, (as that on the <hi>Idleneſs of Buſineſs;</hi> on <hi>Ignorance;</hi> on <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> &amp;c.) to make the Method and Numbers exact, and avoid Repetitions? For tho' (upon reading 'em on this occaſion) I believe they might receive ſuch an Alteration with advantage; yet they would not be chang'd ſo much, but any one would know 'em for the ſame at firſt ſight. Or if you mean to improve the worſt Pieces, which are ſuch as to render them very good, would require a great addition, and almoſt the entire new writing of them? Or, laſtly, if you mean the middle ſort, as the Songs and Love-Verſes? For theſe will need only to be ſhortned, to omit repetition; the Words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0096900700:170"/>
your mind in this, for I am utterly at a loſs. Yet I have try'd what I could do to ſome of the <hi>Songs,</hi>

So that I muſt needs deſire you would apply your Gare wholly at preſent, to thoſe which are yet unpubliſhed, of which there are more than enough to make a conſierable Volume, of full as good ones, nay, I verily believe, of better than any in Vol. I. which I could wiſh you would defer, at leaſt 'till you have finiſh'd theſe that are yet unprinted.</p>
               <p>I ſend you a Sample of ſome few of theſe; namely; the Verſes to Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> in <hi>his old Age;</hi> your new ones on the <hi>Duke of Marlborough,</hi> and two others. I have done all that I thought could be of advantage to them: Some I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, as we do Sun-beams, to improve their Energy and Force; ſome I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken quite away, as we take Branches from a Tree, to add to the Fruit; others I have entirely new expreſs'd, and turned more into Poetry. <hi>Donne</hi> (like one of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors) had infinitely more Wit than he wanted Verſification: for the great dealers
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0096900700:171"/>
in Wit, like thoſe in Trade, take leaſt Pains to ſet off their Goods; while the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdaſhers of ſmall Wit, ſpare for no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations or Ornaments. You have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd me to paint your Shop, and I have done my beſt to bruſh you up like your Neighbours. But I can no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Merit of the Production, than a Midwife to the Virtues and good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Child ſhe helps into the Light.</p>
               <p>The few Things I have entirely added, you will excuſe; you may take them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for your own, becauſe they are no more than Sparks lighted up by your Fire; and you may omit them at laſt, if you think them but Squibs in your Triumphs.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Englefyld</hi> being upon his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> tells me I muſt write to you by him, which I do, not more to comply with his deſire, than to gratify my own; tho' I did it ſo lately by the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger you ſent hither: I take it too as an opportunity of ſending you the fair Copy of the <hi>Poem</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">The Original of it in Blots, and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy, in Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Hand, is in the <hi>Harley-Library,</hi> among other ſuch <hi>Brouillons</hi> of Mr. <hi>Wycher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Poems, corrected by him. <hi>Vid. Lett. Ap.</hi> 10, 1705/6. <hi>Note</hi> (a.)</note> on <hi>Dulneſs,</hi> which was not then finiſh'd, and which I ſhould not care to hazard by the common Poſt. Mr. <hi>Englefyld</hi> is ignorant of the Contents, and I hope your prudence will let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo, for my ſake no leſs than your own: Since if you ſhould reveal any thing of this nature, it would be no wonder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſhould be rais'd, and there are thoſe (I fear) who would be ready to improve them to my diſadvantage. I am ſorry you told the great Man, whom you met in the <hi>Court of Requeſts,</hi> that your Papers were in my hands: No Man alive ſhall ever know any ſuch thing from me; and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0096900700:176"/>
I give you this warning beſides, that tho' your ſelf ſhould ſay I had any way aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted you, I am notwithſtanding reſolv'd to deny it.</p>
               <p>The method of the Copy I ſend you is very different from what it was, and much more regular: For the better help of your Memory, I deſire you to compare it by the <hi>Figures</hi> in the Margin, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame in this Letter. The Poem is now divided into four Parts, mark'd with the literal Figures I. II. III. IV. The firſt contains the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of Dulneſs, and ſhews how upon ſeveral ſuppoſitions, it paſſes for 1. Religion. 2. Philoſophy. 3. Example. 4. Wit. And 5. The cauſe of Wit, and the end of it. The ſecond Part contains the <hi>Advantages</hi> of Dulneſs: 1ſt, In Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and 2dly, at Court; where the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of the Byaſs of a Bowl, and the Weights of a Clock, are directly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to illuſtrate thoſe advantages of Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them; (which was your only objection to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them.) The third contains the <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Dulneſs in all Stations, and ſhews in a great many Particulars, that it is ſo fortunate, as to be eſteem'd ſome good Quality or other in all ſorts of People; that it is thought Quiet, Senſe, Caution,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0096900700:177"/>
Policy, Prudence, Majeſty, Valour, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, Honeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fourth Part I have wholly added, as a Climax which ſums up all the <hi>praiſe, advantage,</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of Dulneſs in a few words, and ſtrengthens them all by the oppoſition of the <hi>diſgrace, diſadvantage,</hi> and <hi>unhappineſs</hi> of Wit, with which it concludes<note n="b" place="bottom">This is totally omitted in the preſent Edition: Some of the Lines in the H. M. are theſe.
<q>
                        <l>Thus Dulneſs, the ſafe Opiate of the Mind,</l>
                        <l>The laſt kind refuge weary Wit can find,</l>
                        <l>Fit for all ſtations, and in each content,</l>
                        <l>Is ſatisfy'd, ſecure, and innocent;</l>
                        <l>No pains it takes, and no offence it gives,</l>
                        <l>Un-fear'd, unhated, undiſturb'd it lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </q>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Tho' the whole be as ſhort again as at firſt, there is not one Thought omitted, but what is a Repetition of ſomething in your firſt Volume, or in this very Paper: Some Thoughts are contracted, where they ſeem'd encompaſs'd with too many words; and ſome new expreſs'd, or added, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll ſee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Simile of the <hi>Clock-Weights;</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="bottom">It was originally thus expreſs'd:

                     </q>
We find it ſo in a Letter of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> dated <hi>April</hi> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Verſes of his, <hi>To the Author of a Poem call'd Succeſſio,</hi> which got out in a Miſcellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> died, and two after he had laid aſide the whole deſign of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Poems.</note>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0096900700:178"/>
and the Verſification throughout, is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch, as no body can be ſhock'd at. The repeated Permiſſions you give me of dealing freely with you, will (I hope) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe what I have done; for if I have not ſpar'd you when I thought Severity would do you a kindneſs, I have not mangled you where I thought there was no abſolute need of Amputation. As to Particulars, I can ſatisfy you better when we meet; in the mean time, pray write to me when you can, you cannot too often.</p>

               <p>YOU may ſee by my Stile, I had the happineſs and ſatisfaction to receive yeſterday (by the hands of that Wagg, Mr. <hi>Englefyld</hi>) your extreme kind and obliging Letter of the 20th of this Month; which, like all the reſt of yours, did at once mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify me, and make me vain; ſince it tells me with ſo much more Wit, Senſe and Kindneſs than mine can expreſs, that my Letters are always welcome to you. So that even whilſt your Kindneſs invites me to write to you, your Wit and Judgment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0096900700:179"/>

               <p>Now, as for my owning your aſſiſtance to me, in over-looking my unmuſical Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and harſher Senſe, and correcting them both, with your Genius, or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I muſt tell you I always own it, (in ſpite of your unpoetick Modeſty) who would do with your Friendſhip as your Charity; conceal your Bounty to magnify the Obligation; and even whilſt you lay on your Friend the Favour, acquit him of the Debt: But that ſhall not ſerve your turn; I will always own, 'tis my infallible Pope has, or would redeem me from a poetical Damning, the ſecond time; and ſave my Rhimes from being condemn'd to the Criticks Flames to all Eternity: But (by the Faith you proſeſs) you know your Works of Supererrogation, transfer'd upon an humble, acknowledging Sinner, may ſave even Him; having good Works enough of your own beſides, to enſure yours, and their Immortality.</p>
               <p>And now for the pains you have taken to recommend my <hi>Dulneſs,</hi> by making it more methodical, I give you a thouſand thanks; ſince true and natural <hi>Dulneſs</hi> is ſhown more by its pretence to form and method, as the Sprightlineſs of Wit by its deſpiſing both.

               <p>THE Compliments you make me, in regard of any inconſiderable Service I could do you, are very unkind, and do but tell me in other words, that my Friend has ſo mean an opinion of me, as to think I expect acknowledgments for trifles; which upon my faith I ſhall equally take amiſs, whether made to my ſelf, or to any others. For God's ſake, (my dear Friend <hi>Wycherley</hi>) think better of me, and believe I deſire no ſort of Favour ſo much, as that of ſerving you, more conſiderably than I have yet been able to do.</p>

and ſorry for the report: In the firſt place, glad that it was not true; and in the next ſorry that it ſhou'd give you any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, or concern more than ordinary for me; for which, as well as your concern for my future well-being or life, I think my ſelf moſt eternally oblig'd to you; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, your concern for either will make me more careful of both. Yet for your ſake I love this Life ſo well, that I ſhall the leſs think of the other; but 'tis in your power to enſure my Happineſs in one and the other, both by your society and good Example, ſo not only contribute to my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity here, but hereaſter.</p>
               <p>Now as to your Excuſe for the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Style, or Letter, I muſt needs tell you, that Friendſhip is much more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to a true Friend than Wit, which is generally ſalſe Reaſoning; and a Friend's reprimand often ſhews more Friendſhip than his compliment: Nay Love, which is more than Friendſhip, is often ſeen, by our Friend's correction of our Follies or Crimes.

                     <hi>Jacob Tonſon</hi>'s ſixth Vol. of <hi>Miſcellany Poems.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Miſcellany,</hi> if it were only to ſhow you that there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0096900700:189"/>
are as bad Poets in this Nation as your Servant. This modern Cuſtom of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Miſcellanies, is very uſeful to the Poets, who, like other Thieves, eſcape by getting into a Crowd, and herd together like <hi>Banditti,</hi> ſafe only in their Multitude. Methinks <hi>Strada</hi> has given a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of theſe kind of Collections; <hi>Nullus hodiè mortalium aut naſcitur, aut moritur, aut praeliatur, aut ruſticatur, aut abit peregrè; aut redit, aut nubit; aut eſt, aut non eſt, (nam etiammortuis iſti canunt) cui non illi extemplò cudant Epicaedia, Genethliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithalamia, Vaticinia, Propemptica, Soteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Paraenetica, Naenias, Nugas.</hi> As to the ſucceſs which you ſay my part has met with, it is to be attributed to what you were pleas'd to ſay of me to the World; which you do well to call your <hi>Propheſy,</hi> ſince whatever is ſaid in my favour, muſt be a Prediction of things that are not yet; you, like a true Godfather, engage on my part for much more than ever I can perform. My Paſtoral Muſe, like other Country Girls, is but put out of Countenance, by what you Courtiers ſay to her; yet I hope you would not deceive me too far, as knowing that a young Scribler's Vanity needs no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits from abroad: for Nature, like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Mother, kindly takes care to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0096900700:190"/>
her Sons with as much of their own, as is neceſſary for their Satisfaction. If my Verſes ſhould meet with a few flying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, <hi>Virgil</hi> has taught me that a young Author has not too much reaſon to be pleas'd with them, when he conſiders, that the natural conſequence of Praiſe, is Envy and Calumny.

               <p>THE laſt I receiv'd from you, was dated the 22d of <hi>May.</hi> I take your charitable hint to me very kindly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you do like a true Friend, and a true Chriſtian, and I ſhall endeavour to follow your Advice, as well as your Example.—As for your wiſhing to ſee your Friend an Hermit with you, I cannot be ſaid to leave the World, ſince I ſhall enjoy in your converſation, all that I can deſire of it; nay, can learn more from you alone, than from my long Experience of the great, or little Vulgar in it.</p>
               <p>As to the Succeſs of your Poems in the late Miſcellany, I told you of in my laſt; (upon my word) I made you no Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for you may be aſſur'd, that all ſorts of Readers like them, except they are

The Salt of your Wit has been enough to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the whole inſipid Hotch-Potch it is mingled <note n="†" place="bottom">The ſixth Volume of <hi>Tonſon</hi>'s Miſcellanies.</note> with; and you will make <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Ladder</hi> raiſe you to Immortality, by which others are turn'd off ſhamefully, to their Damnation (for poetick Thieves as they are) who think to be ſav'd by others good Works, how faulty ſoever their own are: But the Coffee-houſe Wits, or rather Anti-Wits, the Critics, prove their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by approving your Wit; and even the News-Mongers and Poets will own, you have more Invention than they; nay, the Detracters or the Envious, who never ſpeak well of any body, (not even of thoſe they think well of in their abſence) yet will give you (even in your abſence) their good Word; and the <hi>Criticks</hi> only hate you,

               <p>I HAVE had yours of the 30th of the laſt Month, which is kinder than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it ſhou'd be, ſince it tells me you cou'd be better pleas'd to be ſick again in Town

in my company, than to be well in the Country without it; and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of Happineſs than of Health; yet, my dear Friend, ſet raillery or compliment aſide, I can bear your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (which procures your Health and Eaſe) better than I can your company when you are in Pain; for I cannot ſee you ſo without being ſo too.

I hope (in point of your good nature) you will have no cruel Charity for thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mine, you were ſo willing to be troubled with; which I take moſt infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind of you, and ſhall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No Friend can do more for his Friend than preſerving his Reputation (nay not by preſerving his Life)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0096900700:196"/>
ſince by preſerving his Life he can only make him live about threeſcore or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years; but by preſerving his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he can make him live as long as the World laſts; ſo ſave him from damning, when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore I pray condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their Accomplices in <hi>Newgate,</hi> to ſave them from condemnation by the Publick. Be moſt kindly unmerciful to my poetical Faults, and do with my Papers, as you Country-gentlemen do with your Trees, ſlaſh, cut, and lop-off the Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies and dead Parts of my wither'd Bays, that the little remainder may live the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and increaſe the value of them, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the number. I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Pleaſure, notwithſtanding your compliment, which ſays, you take the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindly: Such is the generoſity to your Friends, that you take it kindly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by them to do them a kindneſs; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it to them. Wherefore you may be ſure to be troubled with my Letters out of Intereſt, if not Kindneſs; ſince mine to you will procure yours to me, ſo that I write to you more for my own ſake than yours; leſs to make you think I write well, than to learn from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0096900700:197"/>
you to write better. Thus you ſee Intereſt in my Kindneſs, which is like the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the World, rather to make a Friend than be a Friend; but I am yours, as a true <hi>Plain-dealer.</hi>

               <p>I Return you the <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Paſtorals.</note>Papers you favour'd me with, and had ſent them to you yeſterday morning, but that I thought to have brought them to you laſt night my ſelf. I have read them over ſeveral
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0096900700:204"/>
times with great ſatisfaction. The Preface is very judicious and very learned; and the Verſes very tender and eaſy. The Author ſeems to have a particular Genius for that kind of Poetry, and a Judgment that much exceeds the years you told me he was of. He has taken very freely from the Ancients, but what he has mixt of his own with theirs, is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. 'Tis no flattery at all to ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had written nothing ſo good at his Age<note n="*" place="margin">Sixteen.</note>. I ſhall take it as a favour if you will bring me acquainted with him; and if he will give himſelf the trouble any morning to call at my Houſe, I ſhall be very glad to read the Verſes over with him, and give him my opinion of the particulars more largely than I can well do in this Letter. I am, <hi>Sir,</hi>

               <p>I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter, and ſhall be very glad of the continuance of a correſpondence by which I am like to be ſo great a gainer. I hope when I have the happineſs of ſeeing you again in <hi>London,</hi> not only to read over the Verſes I have now of yours, but more that you have written ſince; for I make no doubt but any one who writes ſo well, muſt write more. Not that I think the moſt voluminous Poets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt, I believe the contrary is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true. I mention'd ſomewhat to you in <hi>London</hi> of a <hi>Paſtoral Comedy,</hi> which I ſhould be glad to hear you had thought upon ſince. I find <hi>Menage</hi> in his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon <hi>Taſſo</hi>'s <hi>Aminta,</hi> reckons up four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Paſtoral Plays in <hi>Italian:</hi> And in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over my old <hi>Italian</hi> Books, I find a great many Paſtorals and Piſcatory Plays, which I ſuppoſe <hi>Menage</hi> reckons together. I find alſo by <hi>Menage,</hi> that <hi>Taſſo</hi> is not the firſt that writ in that kind, he mentioning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other before him, which he himſelf had never ſeen, nor indeed have I. But as the <hi>Aminta, Paſtor Fido,</hi> and <hi>Filli di Sciro</hi> of <hi>Bonarelli</hi> are the three beſt, ſo I think there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0096900700:206"/>
is no diſpute but <hi>Aminta</hi> is the beſt of the three: Not but that the Diſcourſes in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor Fido</hi> are more entertaining and copious in ſeveral peoples opinion, tho' not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Paſtoral; and the Fable of <hi>Bonarelli</hi> more ſurprizing. I do not remember many in other Languages, that have written in this kind with ſucceſs. <hi>Racan</hi>'s <hi>Bergeries</hi> are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are all too full of Conceits. <hi>Rapin</hi> will have the deſign of Paſtoral Plays to be taken from the <hi>Cyclops</hi> of <hi>Euripides.</hi> I am ſure there is nothing of this kind in <hi>Engliſh</hi> worth mentioning, and therefore you have that Field open to your ſelf. You ſee I write to you without any ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or method, as things come into my head, and therefore pray uſe the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with me, who am, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I Cannot omit the firſt opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing thoſe Papers of mine. You have no leſs right to correct me, than the ſame hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0096900700:207"/>
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Man may lay Colours one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till they ſtiffen and deaden the Piece. Beſides to beſtow heightning on every part is monſtrous: Some parts ought to be lower than the reſt; and nothing looks more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, than a Work, where the Thoughts, however different in their own nature, ſeem all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown, where <hi>Weeds, Graſs,</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> are all laid even, and appear undiſtinguiſh'd. I believe too that ſometimes our firſt Thoughts are the beſt, as the firſt ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Grapes makes the fineſt and richeſt Wine.</p>
               <p>I have not attempted any thing of Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Comedy, becauſe I think the Taſte of our Age will not reliſh a Poem of that ſort. People ſeek for what they call <hi>Wit,</hi> on all ſubjects, and in all places; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that Nature loves Truth ſo well, that it hardly ever admits of flouriſhing: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi> is to Nature what <hi>Paint</hi> is to Beauty; it is not only needleſs, but impairs what it wou'd improve. There is a certain Majeſty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintneſs of Wit: inſomuch that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics have excluded it from the loftieſt Poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well as the loweſt, and forbid it to the Epic no leſs than the Paſtoral. I ſhou'd certainly diſpleaſe all thoſe who are charm'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0096900700:208"/>
with <hi>Guarini</hi> and <hi>Bonarelli,</hi> and imitate <hi>Taſſo</hi> not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the <hi>Fable</hi> too. If ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhou'd have place in the ſtory of a Paſtoral Comedy, I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of <hi>Chance</hi> than of <hi>Deſign;</hi> Intrigue not being very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that Innocence, which ought to conſtitute a Shepherd's Character. There is nothing in all the <hi>Aminta</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) but happens by meer accident; unleſs it be the meeting of <hi>Aminta</hi> with <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> at the <hi>Fountain,</hi> which is the contrivance of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and even that is the moſt ſimple in the world: The contrary is obſervable in <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> where <hi>Coriſca</hi> is ſo perfect a Miſtreſs of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to paſs without her. I am inclin'd to think the Paſtoral Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has another diſadvantage, as to the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> Its general deſign is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life, ſo that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter muſt in ſome meaſure debaſe it; and hence it may come to paſs, that even the virtuous Characters will not ſhine ſo much, for want of being oppos'd to their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.—Theſe Thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have reaſon to doubt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0096900700:209"/>
them: but I hope your Judgment will ſet me right.</p>
               <p>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other point: It is how far the liberty of <hi>Borrowing</hi> may extend? I have defended it ſometimes by ſaying, that it ſeems not ſo much the Perfection of Senſe, to ſay things that have <hi>never</hi> been ſaid before, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe <hi>beſt</hi> that have been ſaid <hi>ofteneſt;</hi> and that Writers in the caſe of borrowing from others, are like Trees which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wou'd produce only one ſort of Fruit, but by being grafted upon others, may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes Poetry flouriſh; but then Poets like Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſhou'd repay with ſomething of their own what they take from others; not like Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to tell me ſincerely, if I have not ſtretch'd this Licence too far in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorals? I hope to become a Critic by your Preceps, and a Poet by your Example. Since I have ſeen your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; however you have not taken away all my Vanity, ſo long as you give me leave to profeſs my ſelf</p>

               <p>I Had ſooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the ſame time of my Journey to <hi>Windſor;</hi> but I am now forc'd to put that quite off, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to go to my Corporation of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> I think you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in the right in your Notions of Paſtoral, but I am of opinion, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis what pleaſes the common people, is not what ever pleaſes the beſt judges. <hi>Paſtor Fido</hi> indeed has had more admirers than <hi>Aminta;</hi> but I will venture to ſay, there is a great deal of difference between the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of one and the other. <hi>Coriſca,</hi> which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Paſtorl; and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narelli</hi>'s fancy of making his Shepherdeſs in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Borrowing;</hi> 'tis very evident the beſt <hi>Latin</hi> Poets have extended this very far; and none ſo far as <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is the beſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0096900700:211"/>
of them. As for the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, if we cannot trace them ſo plainly, 'tis perhaps becauſe we have none before them; 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that moſt of them borrow'd from <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> has been accus'd of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that wrote before him, that his Thefts might not be diſcover'd. The beſt of the modern Poets in all Languages, are thoſe that have the neareſt copied the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry, the Thoughts are ſo obvious (at leaſt if they are natural) that whoever writes laſt, muſt write things like what have been ſaid before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, and accuſe the Moderns of having ſtol'n thoſe Inventions from them; it being evident in all ſuch caſes, that whoever live firſt, muſt firſt find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<q>
                     <l>—unus &amp; alter Aſſuitur pannus,</l>
                  </q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts ſtol'n, and all the reſt is quite different from it, a Poem makes a very fooliſh figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Antients ſo mixt with that of the Moderns, that none can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the one from the other, I can never
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0096900700:212"/>
find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion, and that I have ſhewn your Verſes to ſome who have made that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them. I have ſo much Company round me while I write this, and ſuch a noiſe in my ears, that 'tis impoſſible I ſhould write any thing but Nonſenſe, ſo muſt break off abruptly. I am, Sir,</p>

               <p>AT my return from the North I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the favour of your Letter, which had lain there till then. Having been abſent about ſix weeks, I read over your Paſtorals again, with a great deal of pleaſure, and to judge the better read <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s Eclogues, and <hi>Spenſer</hi>'s Calendar, at the ſame time; and I aſſure you I continue the ſame opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to improve them, 'tis probable you
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0096900700:213"/>
will make them yet better againſt Winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a Man may correct his Verſes till he takes away the true Spirit of them; eſpecially if he ſubmits to the correction of ſome who paſs for great Critics, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Rules, and never enter into the true Deſign and Genius of an Author. I have ſeen ſome of theſe that would hardly allow any one good Ode in <hi>Horace,</hi> who cry <hi>Virgil</hi> wants fancy, and that <hi>Homer</hi> is very incorrect. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rate of mortals; but generally they are great admirers of <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Lucan;</hi> and when they write themſelves, we find out all the Myſtery. They ſcan their Verſes upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the firſt may be laſt, or the laſt firſt, without any ſort of prejudice to their Works; in which there is no Deſign, or Method, or any thing Natural or Juſt. For you are certainly in the right, that in all Writings whatſoever (not Poetry only) <hi>Nature</hi> is to be follow'd; and we ſhou'd be jealous of our ſelves for being ſond of <hi>Similes, Conceits,</hi> and what they call ſaying <hi>Fine Things.</hi> When we werein the North, my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> ſhew'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0096900700:214"/>
me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain great <note n="*" place="bottom">The Earl of <hi>P</hi>
                  </note>General in <hi>Spain;</hi> I told him I wou'd by all means have that General recall'd, and ſet to writing here at home, for it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a Man with ſo much Wit as he ſhew'd, cou'd be fit to command an Army, or do any other Buſineſs. As for what you ſay of Expreſſion: 'tis indeed the ſame thing to Wit, as Dreſs is to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I have ſeen many Women over-dreſt, and ſeveral look better in a careleſs Night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoiſelle <hi>Spanheim</hi> dreſt for a Ball. I do not deſign to be in <hi>London</hi> till towards the Parliament: then I ſhall certainly be there; and hope by that time you will have finiſht your Paſtorals as you would have them appear in the world, and particularly the third of <hi>Autumn</hi> which I have not yet ſeen. Your laſt Eclogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſame Subject as that of mine on Mrs. <hi>Tempeſt</hi>'s Death, I ſhou'd take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn, as if it were to the Memory of the ſame Lady, if they were not written for ſome particular Woman whom you wou'd make immortal.

               <p>AFter the Thoughts I have already ſent you on the ſubject of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you deſire my opinion as to ſome farther particulars. There are indeed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Niceties, which tho' not much obſerved even by correct Verſifiers, I cannot but think deſerve to be better regarded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may expreſs it ſo) a Style of Sound. As in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a gliding Stream, the Numbers ſhou'd run eaſy and ſlowing: in deſcribing a rough Torrent or Deluge, ſonorous and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0096900700:216"/>
and ſo of the reſt. This is evident every where in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and no where elſe that I know of to any obſervable degree. The following Examples will make this plain, which I have taken from <hi>Vida.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Molle viam tacito lapſu per levia radit.</l>
                     <l>Incedit tardo molimine ſubſidendo.</l>
                     <l>Luctantes ventos, tempeſtateſque ſonoras.</l>
                     <l>Immenſo cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</l>
                     <l>Telum imbelle ſine ictu, Conjecit.</l>
                     <l>Tolle moras, cape ſaxa manu, cape robora Paſtor,</l>
                     <l>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite peſtem.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This, I think, is what very few obſerve in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force in imprinting the image on the reader: We have one excellent Example of it in our Language, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Ode on St. <hi>Caecilia</hi>'s Day, entitled, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Every nice Ear, muſt (I believe) have obſerv'd, that in any ſmooth <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe of ten ſyllables, there is naturally a <hi>Pauſe</hi> at the fourth, fifth, or ſixth ſyllable. It is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0096900700:217"/>
upon theſe the Ear reſts, and upon the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Verſification. For example,</p>
               <p>At the fifth. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Where-e'er thy Navy ‖ ſpreads her canvas Wings.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At the fourth. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Homage to thee ‖ and Peace to all ſhe brings.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſixth. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Like Tracts of Leverets ‖ in Morning Snow.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now I fancy, that to preſerve an exact Harmony and Variety, the Pauſes of the 4th or 6th ſhou'd not be continu'd above three lines together, without the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of another; elſe it will be apt to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at leaſt it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite ſo dead a weight, ſo tires not ſo much tho' it be continued longer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to <hi>Exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> whether Words or Syllables, which are made uſe of purely to ſupply a vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>Do</hi> before Verbs plural is abſolutely ſuch; and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode <hi>did</hi> and <hi>does</hi> in the ſame manner, which are almoſt always
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0096900700:218"/>
uſed for the ſake of Rhime. The ſame Cauſe has occaſioned the promiſcuous uſe of <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to the ſame Perſon, which can never ſound ſo graceful as either one or the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would alſo object to the Irruption of <hi>Alexandrine</hi> Verſes of twelve ſyllables, which I think ſhould never be allow'd but when ſome remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has been too free of theſe, eſpecially in his latter Works. I am of the ſame opinion as to <hi>Triple Rhimes.</hi>
               </p>

You are but too good a Painter already; and no Picture of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s was ever ſo beautiful, as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.

I have imagination enough in your abſence, to trace ſome reſemblance of you; but I have been ſo long us'd to loſe my judgment at the ſight of you, that 'tis paſt my power to correct it by the life. Your Picture ſeems leaſt like when plac'd before your eyes, and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifeſt diſadvantage by being ſet in the faireſt Light in the world. The Painters are a very vain gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and have a long time pretended to rival Nature; but to own the truth to you, ſhe made ſuch a finiſh'd piece about three and twenty years ago, (I beg your pardon Madam, I proteſt I meant but two and twenty) that 'tis in vain for them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to contend with her.

It becomes our Sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allow us: By this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I may write to you moſt impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe you once anſwer'd me modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if you ſhou'd never do me that honour for the future, I am to think (like a true Coxcomb) that your ſilence gives conſent.

Secondly, becauſe I fancy you ſpell better, as having been at ſchool later. Thirdly, becauſe you have nothing to do but to write if you pleaſe, and poſſibly it may keep you from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying your ſelf worſe: it may ſave ſome honeſt neighbouring Gentleman from three or four of your peſtilent glances. Caſt your eyes upon Paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: Men are ſeducing, books are dangerous, the amorous one's ſoften you, and the godly one's give you the ſpleen: If you look upon trees, they claſp in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; birds and beaſts make love; the Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon melts you into yielding and melancholy. Therefore I ſay once more, caſt your eyes upon Paper, and read only ſuch Letters as I write, which convey no darts, no flames, but proceed from Innocence of ſoul, and ſimplicity of heart. However, I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you a Bonnet lin'd with green for your eyes, but take care you don't tarniſh it with ogling too fiercely: I am told, that hand you ſhade your ſelf with this ſhining weather, is tann'd pretty much, only with being carried over thoſe Eyes—thank God I am an hundred miles off from them—

               <p>THE Wits would ſay, that this muſt needs be a dull Letter, becauſe it is a marry'd one. I am afraid indeed you will find what Spirit there is muſt be on the ſide of the Wife, and the Husband's part as uſual will prove the dulleſt. What an unequal Pair are put together in this ſheet? in which tho' we ſin, it is you muſt do penance. When you look on both ſides of this paper, you may fancy that our words (according to a Scripture expreſſion) are as a <hi>Two-edg'd Sword,</hi> whereof Lady <hi>M.</hi> is the ſhining blade and I only the Handle. But I can't proceed without ſo far mortifying Sir <hi>Robert</hi> as to tell him, that ſhe writes this purely in obedience to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0096900700:227"/>
me, and that it is but one of thoſe honours a Husband receives for the ſake of his Wife.</p>
               <p>It is making court ill to one fine Woman to ſhew her the regard we have for another; and yet I muſt own there is not a period of this Epiſtle but ſquints toward another over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt it. It will be in vain to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Your penetrating Eyes cannot but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how all the letters that compoſe theſe words lean forward after Lady <hi>M</hi>'s letters, which ſeem to bend as much from mine, and fly from them as faſt as they are able. Ungrateful letters that they are! which give themſelves to another man in the very preſence of him who will yield to no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in knowing how to value them.</p>
               <p>You will think I forget my ſelf, and am not writing to you; but let me tell you, 'tis you forget your ſelf in that thought, for you are almoſt the only Woman to whom one can ſafely addreſs the praiſes of another. Beſides can you imagine a Man of my importance ſo ſtupid, as to ſay fine things to you before your Husband? Let us ſee how far Lady <hi>M.</hi> her ſelf dares do any thing like it, with all the wit and addreſs ſhe is miſtreſs of. If Sir <hi>Robert</hi> can be ſo ignorant (now he is left to himſelf in the country) to imagine any ſuch matter, let him know from me, that here in town
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0096900700:228"/>
every thing that Lady ſays, is taken for Satire. For my part, every body knows it is my conſtant practice to ſpeak Truth; and I never do it more than when I call my ſelf.</p>

few proficients have a greater genius for Monſters than my ſelf; but I never taſted a monſter to that degree I have done this creature: It was not, like other monſters, produced in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> nor came from the country of the <hi>Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul,</hi> but is the production of the joint-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of a <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Parſon and his Spouſe, who intended in the ſingleneſs of heart to have begot a chriſtian but of one ſex, and providence has ſent them one of two.</p>
               <p>There are various opinions concerning this Creature about town, Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> obſerves that the Age is very licentious, and the preſent Reign very lewd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, in permitting a Lady <hi>by Authoriy</hi> (as appears by the printed bills) to expoſe her perſonal curioſities for a ſhilling.</p>

                  </hi> is of the ſame opinion.</p>
               <p>Among theſe various conjectures, that I might be informed of the truth, I took along with me a Phyſician and a Divine, the one to inſpect the ſtate of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The perſons I made choice of were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Dr. <hi>P<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> We were no ſooner in the room but the Party came to us dreſt in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical imitation of Men—your ſharp wit, my dear Siſter, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-habit.</p>
               <p>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my ſelf look'd firſt. The Prieſt you will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly fancy was in his nature moſt an Infidel, and doubted moſt of this Miracle: we therefore propos'd to him to take the ſureſt method of believing, ſeeing and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He comply'd with both admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of ſnuff upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we ſhould by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male, for by ſo doing we ſhould be guilty of leſs ſinfulneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:0096900700:231"/>
The Doctor upon inſpection differ'd from this opinion, he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at moſt a natural one: He ſaid upon the whole it was a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think otherwiſe, was a trifle, nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for.</p>
               <p>As for this Party's temper of mind, it appears to be a moſt even diſpoſition, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the good qualities of both ſexes: for ſhe is neither ſo inacceſſible as other Ladies, nor is he ſo impudent as other Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant a turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman, and that ſhe tells the Gentlemen ſhe has the <hi>Tendre</hi> of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. As a further proof of this affable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he formerly receiv'd viſits of the fair ſex in their maſques, till an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fellow in a female diſguiſe mingled with a party of ladies, and impudently overheard their improving Speculations.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, ſhe civilly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at my requeſt, that my two ſiſters ſhould be admitted privately whenever you wou'd do her the honour of your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to <hi>Bath</hi> fell out in the three hundred ſeventy ſixth week of the Reign of my Sovereign Lady <hi>Sylvia.</hi> At the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0096900700:233"/>
preſent writing hereof it is the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty ninth week of the Reign of your moſt Serene Majeſty, in whoſe ſervice I was liſted ſome weeks before I beheld your Siſter. This information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either ſhall happen to be Queen-Regent at that time.</p>
               <p>Pray tell your ſiſter, all the good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and virtuous inclinations ſhe has, never gave me ſo much pleaſure in her converſation, as that one vice of her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy will give me mortification this month. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> commands her to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſhe refuſes! indeed if I were in <hi>Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> I ſhould honour her for this obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and magniſy her no leſs for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than we do the <hi>Barcelonians.</hi> But people change with the change of places (as we ſee of late) and virtues become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces when they ceaſe to be for one's intereſt, with me, as with others.</p>
               <p>Yet let me tell her, ſhe will never look ſo finely while ſhe is upon earth, as ſhe would here in the water. It is not here as in moſt other inſtances, for thoſe Ladies that would pleaſe extremely, muſt go <hi>out</hi> of their own element. She does not make half ſo good a figure on horſeback as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden;</hi> but were ſhe once ſeen in the Bath, no man wou'd part with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0096900700:234"/>
her for the beſt Mermaid in chriſtendom. You know I have ſeen you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white; I have experienc'd the utmoſt you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful ſteps, deſerve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and eaſy behaviour in <hi>Buckram:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between ſwimming and walking, free enough, and more modeſtly-half-naked, than you can appear any where elſe. You have conquer'd enough already by land; ſhow your ambition, and vanquiſh alſo by water. We have no pretty Admirals on theſe Seas, but muſt ſtrike ſails to your white Flags, were they once hoiſted up. The Buckram I mention is a dreſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly uſeful at this time, when we are told the Princeſs is bringing over the faſhion of <hi>German</hi> Ruffs: You ought to uſe your ſelves to ſome degrees of ſtiffneſs beforehand. And when our Ladies chins have been tickled a-while with ſtarch'd muſlin and wire, they may poſſibly bear the bruſh of a <hi>German</hi> beard and whisker.</p>
               <p>I cou'd tell you a delightful ſtory of Dr. <hi>P.</hi> but want room to diſplay it in all its ſhining circumſtances. He had heard it was an excellent cure for Love, to kiſs the Aunt of the perſon beloved, who is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of years and experience enough to

               <p>IF you ask how the waters agree with me, I muſt tell you, ſo very well, that I queſtion how you and I ſhould agree if we were in a room by our ſelves? Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> has honeſtly aſſured me, that but for ſome whims which ſhe can't entirely conquer, ſhe would go and ſee the world with me in man's cloaths. Even you, <hi>Madam,</hi> I fancy (if you wou'd not partake in our adventures) would wait our coming in at the evening with ſome impatience, and be well enough pleas'd to hear 'em by the fire-ſide. That would be better than reading Romances, unleſs Lady <hi>M.</hi> would be our Hiſtorian; for as ſhe is married, ſhe has probably lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hours in the night-time, to write or do what ſhe will in. What raiſes theſe deſires in me, is an acquaintance I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0096900700:236"/>
with my Lady <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who has all the ſpirit of the laſt age, and all the gay experience of a pleaſurable life. It were as ſcandalous an omiſſion to come to the <hi>Bath</hi> and not to ſee my Lady <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> as it had formerly been to have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd to <hi>Rome</hi> without viſiting the Queen of <hi>Sweeden.</hi> She is, in a word, the beſt thing this Country has to boaſt of; and as ſhe has been all that a woman of ſpirit could be, ſo ſhe ſtill continues that eaſy and independent creature that a ſenſible woman always will be.</p>
               <p>I muſt tell you a truth, which is not however much to my credit. I never thought ſo muſt of your ſelf and your ſiſter, as ſince I have been fourſcore miles diſtance from you. In the Foreſt I look'd upon you as good neighbours, at <hi>London</hi> as pretty kind of women, but here as divinities, angels, goddeſſes, or what you will. In the ſame manner I never knew at what a rate I valu'd your life, till you were upon the point of dying. If Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> and you will but fall very ſick every ſeaſon, I ſhall certainly die for you. Seriouſly I value you both ſo much that I eſteem others much the leſs for your ſakes; you have robb'd me of the pleaſure of eſteeming a thouſand pretty qualities in them, by ſhowing me ſo many finer in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0096900700:237"/>
your ſelves. There are but two things in the world which could make you indifferent to me, which I believe you are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, I mean Ill-nature and malice. I have ſeen enough of you not to overlook any Frailty you cou'd have, and nothing leſs than a Vice can make me like you leſs. I expect you ſhou'd diſcover by my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards you both, that this is true, and that therefore you ſhould pardon a thouſand things in me for that one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Expect nothing from me but truths and freedom, and I ſhall always be thought by you what I always am,</p>

I never ſaw ſo great a thing with ſo much littleneſs in it: I think the Architect built it entirely in compliance to the taſte of its Owners: For it is the moſt inhoſpitable thing imaginable, and the moſt ſelfiſh: it has, like their own hearts, no room for ſtrangers, and no reception for any perſon of ſuperior quality to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There are but two Apartments, for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0096900700:243"/>
the Maſter and Miſtreſs, below; and but two apartments above (very much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to them) in the whole Houſe. When you look upon the outſide, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you ſee the inſide, it is too little for a Subject; and has not conveniency to lodge a common family. It is a houſe of Entries and Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; among which there are three Viſta's through the whole, very uſeleſsly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but ſpoil'd by two Arches towards the End of it, which take away the ſight of ſeveral of the windows. There are two ordinary ſtair-caſes inſtead of one great one. The beſt things within the houſe, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well-proportion'd; and the cellars and offices under-ground, which are the moſt commodious, and the beſt contrived of the whole. At the top of the Building are ſeveral Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the building look at once fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and heavy. What ſeems of the beſt taſte, is that Front towards the gardens, which is not yet loaded with theſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets. The two Sides of the building are intirely ſpoil'd by two monſtrous bow-windows which ſtand juſt in the middle, inſtead of doors: And as if it were fatal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0096900700:244"/>
that ſome trifling littleneſs ſhould every where deſtroy the grandeur, there are in the chief front two ſemicircles of a lower ſtructure than the reſt, that cut off the arges, and look as it they were purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign'd to hide a loſtier and nobler piece of building, the top of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears above them.

               <p>Indeed I was treated in ſuch a manner, that I could not but ſometimes ask my ſelf in my mind, what College I was founder of, or what Library I had built?

               <p>YOU are by this time ſatisfy'd how much the tenderneſs of one man of merit is to be prefer'd to the addreſſes of a thouſand. And, by this time, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman you have made choice of is ſenſible, how great is the joy of having all thoſe charms and good qualities which have pleas'd ſo many, now apply'd to pleaſe one only.

               <p>THE chief cauſe I have to repent my leaving the town, is the uncertainty I am in every day of your Siſter's ſtate of health I really expected by every poſt to have heard of her recovery, but on the contrary each letter has been a new awakening to my apprehenſions, and I have ever ſince ſuffer'd allarms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on allarms on her account.

               <p>IT is with infinite ſatisfaction I am made acquainted that your brother will at laſt prove your relation, and has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd ſuch ſentiments as become him in your concern.

                  </gap> that which is one of the greateſt pleaſures, the knowledge that others enter'd into my own ſentiments concerning you. I ever was of opinion that you wanted no more to be vindicated than to be known; and like Truth, cou'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no where but you muſt conquer. As I have often condol'd with you in your adverſities, ſo I have a right which but few can pretend to, of congratulating on the proſpect of your better fortunes; and I hope for the future to have the concern I have felt for you overpaid in your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Tho' you modeſtly ſay the world has left you, yet I verily believe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you again as faſt as it can: For to give the world its due, it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis paſt its power to oppoſe it. Therefore if you ſhould take it into favour again upon its repentance, and continue in it, you would be ſo far from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0096900700:259"/>
leading what is commonly call'd an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled life (and what you with too much unjuſt ſeverity call a vagabond Life) that the wiſe cou'd only look upon you as a Prince in a progreſs, who travels to gain the affections he has not, or to fix thoſe he already has; which he effectually does wherever he ſhews himſelf. But if you are reſolv'd in revenge to rob the world of ſo much example as you may afford it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your deſign will be vain; for even in a Monaſtery your devotions cannot carry you ſo far towards the next world as to make This loſe the ſight of you, but you'll be like a Star, that while it is fix'd to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhines over all the Earth.</p>

               <p>I Can ſay little to recommend the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I ſhall write to you, but that they will be the moſt impartial repreſentations of a free heart, and the trueſt copies you ever ſaw, tho' of a very mean original. Not a feature will be ſoften'd, or any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous light employ'd to make the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing a little leſs hideous: but you ſhall find it in all reſpects, moſt horribly like. You will do me an injuſtice if you look upon any thing I ſhall ſay from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, as a compliment, either to you or my ſelf: Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour; and I know you'll no more expect it of me to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere till death in every ſentiment or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I now ſet down, than you would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a man's face ſhould never change when once his picture was drawn.</p>
               <p>The freedom I ſhall uſe in this manner of <hi>thinking aloud,</hi> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the beſt ſort of fools, the honeſt ones. And ſince what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in ſpight of all our art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almoſt fooliſh to take any pains to conceal it at
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0096900700:261"/>
all, and almoſt knaviſh to do it from thoſe that are our friends. If <hi>Momus</hi>'s project had taken, of having windows in our breaſts, I ſhou'd be for carrying it further, and making thoſe windows; caſements; that while a man ſhow'd his heart to all the world, he might do ſomething more for his friends, even give it them, and truſt it to their handling. I think I love you as well as King <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Herodias</hi> (tho' I never had ſo much as one dance with you) and would as freely give you my heart in a diſh, as he did another's head. But ſince <hi>Jupiter</hi> will not have it ſo, I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſhew my taſte in life, as I do my taſte in painting, by loving to have as little drapery as poſſible. Not that I think every body naked altogether ſo fine a ſight as your ſelf and a few more would be; but becauſe 'tis good to uſe people to what they muſt be acquainted with; and there will certainly come ſome day of judgment or other, to uncover every ſoul of us. We ſhall then ſee that the <hi>Prues</hi> of this world ow'd all their fine figure only to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrater-lac'd than the reſt; and that they are naturally as arrant Squabs as thoſe that never girded their loins at all.—But a particular reaſon that may engage you to write your thoughts the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, is, that I am confident no one
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0096900700:262"/>
knows you better: for I find, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers expreſs their thoughts of you, they fall very ſhort of mine, and I know at the ſame time theirs are ſuch as you would think ſufficient in your favour.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily imagine how deſirous I muſt be of a correſpondence with a perſon, who had taught me long ago that it was as poſſible to eſteem at firſt ſight, as to love: and who has ſince ruin'd me for all the converſation of one ſex, and almoſt all the friendſhip of the other. I am but too ſenſible, thro' your means, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men wants a certain ſoftneſs to recommend it, and that of women wants every thing elſe. How often have I been quietly going to take poſſeſſion of that tranquillity and indolence I had ſo long found in the country; when one evening of your converſation has ſpoil'd me for a <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire!</hi> Books have loſt their effect upon me, and I was convinced, ſince I ſaw you, that there is one alive wiſer than all the Sages: a plague of female wiſdom! it makes a man ten times more uneaſy than his own. What is very ſtrange, Virtue herſelf (when you have the dreſſing her) is too amiable for one's repoſe. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have ſeen you to have converſed with you; they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0096900700:263"/>
would have been ſtrangely bit, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and you had bewitch'd them with Reaſon and Virtue (two Beauties that the very Fops pretend to have no acquaintance with.)</p>
               <p>The unhappy diſtance at which we cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond, removes a great many of thoſe reſtrictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer converſation prejudice truth, to ſave good breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a bluſh; we converſe upon ſuch unfortunate generous terms, as exclude the regards of fear, ſhame, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in either of us. And methinks it would be as paltry a part, to impoſe (even in a ſingle thought) upon each other in this ſtate of ſeparation, as for Spirits of a different ſphere who have ſo little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with us, to employ that little (as ſome would make us think they do) in putting tricks and deluſions upon poor mortals.</p>
               <p>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a queſtion, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than moſt inſtances of my Life. In what manner did I behave the laſt hour I ſaw you? What degree of concern did I diſcover when I felt a misfortune which I hope you will
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0096900700:264"/>
never feel, that of parting from what one moſt eſteems? for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greateſt of all the hypocrites that ever decency made.</p>
               <p>I never ſince paſs by your houſe but with the ſame ſort of melancholy that we feel upon ſeeing the Tomb of a friend, which only ſerves to put us in mind of what we have loſt. I reflect upon the circumſtances of your departure, which I was there a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of (your behaviour in what I may call your laſt moments) and I indulge a gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my kind of pleaſure in thinking that thoſe laſt moments were given to me. I would fain imagine this was not accidental, but proceeded from a penetration which I know you have, in finding out the truth of people's ſentiments; and that you were willing, the laſt man that <hi>would have</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from you, ſhould be that laſt that <hi>did.</hi> I really look'd upon you juſt as the friends of <hi>Curtius</hi> might have done upon that Hero, at the inſtant when he was devoting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Glory, and running to be loſt out of generoſity. I was obliged to admire your reſolution, in as great a degree as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored it; and had only to wiſh, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would reward ſo much Virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could enjoy elſewhere!</p>

The advantage of hearing your ſentiments by diſcovering mine, was what I always thought a great one, and even worth the riſque I generally run of manifeſting my own indiſcretion. You then rewarded my truſt in you the moment it was given, for you pleas'd or inform'd me the minute you anſwer'd. I muſt now be contented with more ſlow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns. However 'tis ſome pleaſure, that your thoughts upon Paper will be a more laſting poſſeſſion to me, and that I ſhall no longer have cauſe to complain of a loſs I have ſo often regretted, that of any
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0096900700:266"/>
thing you ſaid, which I happen'd to forget. In earneſt, Madam, if I were to write to you as often as I think of you, it muſt be every day of my life. I attend you in ſpirit through all your ways, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you thro' every ſtage in books of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and fear for you thro' whole folio's; you make me ſhrink at the paſt dangers of dead travellers; and if I read of a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect, or agreeable place, I hope it yet ſubſiſts to pleaſe you. I enquire the roads, the amuſements, the company, of every town and country thro' which you paſs, with as much diligence, as if I were to ſet out next week to overtake you. In a word, no one can have you more conſtantly in mind, not even your guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angel (if you have one) and I am willing to indulge ſo much Popery, as to fancy ſome Being takes care of you who knows your value better than you do your ſelf: I am willing to think that Heaven never gave ſo much ſelf-neglect and reſolution to a woman, to occaſion her calamity, but am pious enough to believe thoſe qualities muſt be intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to her benefit and her glory.</p>
               <p>Your firſt ſhort letter only ſerves to ſhow me you are alive: it puts me in mind of the firſt Dove that return'd to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0096900700:267"/>
                  <hi>Noah,</hi> and juſt made him know it had found no reſt abroad.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in it that pleaſes me, but when you tell me you had no Sea-ſickneſs. I beg your next may give me all the pleaſure it can, that is, tell me any that you receive. You can make no diſcoveries that will be half ſo valuable to me as thoſe of your own mind; Nothing that regards the States or Kingdoms you paſs through, will engage ſo much of my curioſity or concern, as what relates to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Your welfare, to ſay truth, is more at my heart than that of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſure I may defend the truth, though perhaps not the virtue, of this declaration. One is ignorant, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at beſt, of the merits of differing religions and governments: but private virtues one can be ſure of. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know what particular perſon has deſert enough to merit being happier than others, but not what nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to conquer or oppreſs another. You will ſay, I am not <hi>Publick-ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> let it be ſo, I may have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tenderneſſes, particularly regards, or narrow views; but at the ſame time I am certain that whoever wants theſe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0096900700:268"/>
can never have a <hi>Publick-ſpirit;</hi> for (as a friend of mine ſays) how is it poſſible for that man to love twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand people, who never loved one?</p>
               <p>I communicated your letter to Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

thoſe bleſſings and earthly proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Divines tell us are the cauſe of our Perdition; for if he makes you happy in this world, I dare truſt your own virtue to do it in the other. I am,</p>

               <p>I Had pleas'd myſelf ſooner in writing to you, but that I have been your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in a Fit of Sickneſs, and am not yet ſo much recovered, but that I have thoughts of uſing your <note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſes.</note>Phyſicians. They are as grave Perſons as any of the Faculty, and (like the Antients) carry their own Medicaments about with them. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Moderns are ſuch Lovers of Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, that nothing is grave enough to eſcape them. Let 'em laugh, but People will ſtill have their Opinions: As they think our Doctors Aſſes to them, we'll think them Aſſes to our Doctors.</p>

I am glad you are ſo much in a better State of Health, as to follow me to jeſt about it. My Concern, when I heard of your Danger, was ſo very ſerious, that I almoſt take it ill Dr. <hi>Evans</hi> ſhould tell you of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly, if you and a few more ſuch people were to leave the World, I would not give Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to ſtay in it.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo much concern'd as to the point, whether you are to live fat or lean: Moſt Men of Wit or Honeſty are uſually decreed to live very lean; ſo I am inclined to the opinion that 'tis decreed you ſhall: However be comforted, and reflect that you'll make the better Buſto for it.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſomething particular in you, not to be ſatisfied with ſending me your own Books, but to make your Acquaintance continue the Frolick. Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> forc'd me to take <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> which has ſince done me great Credit with ſeveral People, as it has done <hi>Dryden</hi> and <hi>Oldham</hi> ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, in ſhewing there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between their <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> and this, as between Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and King <hi>George.</hi> It is truly a Scandal, that Men ſhould write with Contempt of a Piece which they never once ſaw, as thoſe two Poets did, who were ignorant even of the Sex, as well as Senſe, of <hi>Gorboduc.</hi>

them. If therefore you are ever moved on my Account by that Spirit, which I take to be as familiar to you as a Quotidian Ague, I mean the Spirit of Goodneſs, pray never ſtint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Civility beyond my natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I dare truſt you, Sir, not only with my Folly when I write, but with my Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence when I do not; and expect equally your Pardon for either.</p>
               <p>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the reſt of this Paper, it ſhould be ſpotted and diverſified with Conceits all over; you ſhould be put out of Breath with Laughter at each Sentence, and pauſe at each Period, to look back over how much Wit you had paſs'd. But I have found by Experience, that People now a-days regard Writing as little as they do Preaching: The moſt we can hope is to be heard, juſt with Decency and Patience, once a Week, by Folks in the Country: Here in Town we hum over a Piece of fine Writing, and we whiſtle at a Sermon. The Stage is the only Place we ſeem alive at; there indeed we ſtare, and roar, and clap Hands for K. <hi>George</hi> and the Government. As for all other Virtues but this Loyalty, they are an obſolete Train, ſo ill-dreſs'd, that Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, hiſs 'em out of all good Company. Humility knocks ſo ſneakingly at the Door,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0096900700:274"/>
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes it give way to the free Entrance of Pride, Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</p>
               <p>My Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> from having ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in your Company too long, really behaves herſelf ſcandalouſly among us: She pretends to open her Eyes for the Sake of ſeeing the Sun, and to ſleep becauſe it is Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is thought to have ſaid her Prayers before; talks without any manner of Shame of good Books, and has not ſeen <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Play of the <hi>Non-juror.</hi> I rejoiced the other Day to ſee a Libel on her Toilette, which gives me ſome Hope that you have at leaſt a Taſte of Scandal left you, in Defect of all other Vices.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, I heartily wiſh you well; but as I cannot entirely deſire the Ruin of all the Joys of this City, ſo all that remains is to wiſh you wou'd keep your Happineſs to your ſelves, that the happieſt here may not die with Envy at a Bliſs which they cannot attain to.</p>

               <p>YOU'LL think me very full of my ſelf, when after a long Silence (which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0096900700:275"/>
however to ſay Truth has rather been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to contemplate of you, than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you) I begin to talk of my own Works. I find it is in the finiſhing a Book, as in concluding a Seſſion of Parliament, one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thinks it will be very ſoon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd for Incidents to retard the clearing <hi>any publick Account,</hi> and ſo I ſee it is in mine. I have plagued myſelf, like great Miniſters, with undertaking too much for one Man, and with a Deſire of doing more than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me, have done leſs than I ought.</p>
               <p>For having deſign'd four very laborious and uncommon ſorts of Indexes to <hi>Homer,</hi> I'm forc'd, for want of Time, to publiſh two only; the Deſign of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully executed. I've alſo been oblig'd to leave unfiniſh'd in my Desk the Heads of two Eſſays, one on the <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and another on the <hi>Oratory</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> So they muſt wait for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Editions, or periſh; and (one Way or other, no great Matter which) <hi>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think of you every Day, I aſſure you, even without ſuch good Memorials of you as your Siſters, with whom I ſometimes talk of you, and find it one of the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all Subjects to them. My Lord
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0096900700:276"/>
                  <hi>Digby</hi> muſt be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There needs no more than an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with your Family, to make all Elder Sons wiſh they had Fathers to their Lives-end.</p>
               <p>I can't touch upon the Subject of filial Love, without putting you in mind of an old Woman, who has a ſincere, hearty, old-faſhion'd Reſpect for you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly blames her Son for not having writ to you oftner, to tell you ſo.</p>
               <p>I very much wiſh (but what ſignifies my wiſhing? my Lady <hi>Scudamore</hi> wiſhes, your Siſter's wiſh) that you were with us, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the beautiful Contraſt this Seaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas you could form in the Winter can make you imagine what <hi>Twickenham</hi> is (and what your Friend Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Twickenham</hi> is) in this warmer Seaſon. Our River glitters beneath an unclouded Sun, at the ſame time that its Banks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Verdure of Showers: Our Gardens are offering their firſt Noſegays; our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought happily together, are ſtretching their Arms to meet each other, and growing nearer and nearer every Hour: The Birds are paying their thankſgiving Songs for the new Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have made 'em: My Building rites
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0096900700:277"/>
high enough to attract the Eye and Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of the Paſſenger from the River, where, upon beholding a Mixture of Beauty and Ruin, he enquires what Houſe is falling, or what Church is riſing? So little taſte have our common Tritons of <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> whatever Delight the true, unſeen, poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Gods of the River may take, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on their Streams my <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, or <hi>Ionic</hi> Pilaſters.</p>
               <p>But (to deſcend from all this Pomp of Style) the beſt Account I can give of what I am building, is, that it will afford me a few pleaſant Rooms for ſuch a Friend as yourſelf, or a cool Situation for an Hour or two for Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> when ſhe will do me the Honour (at this Publick Houſe on the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</p>
               <p>The Moment I am writing this, I am ſurprized with the account of the Death of a Friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talking of, a meer Jeſt!

               <p>YOUR Doctor is going to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſtays a Fortnight or more: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would be comforted to have a Sight of him, whether you need him or not.

The Spirit of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy,</hi> ſo long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him: He is a Philoſopher all of Fire; ſo warmly, nay ſo wildly in the Right, that he ſorces all others about him to be ſo too, and draws them into his

               <p>As all human Life is chequer'd and mix'd with Acquiſitions and Loſſes (though the latter are more certain and irremediable, than the former laſting or ſatisfactory) ſo at the time I have gain'd the Acquaintance of one worthy Man I have loſt another, a very eaſy, human, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr. <hi>Stonor.</hi> It's certain the Loſs of one of this Character puts us na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally upon ſetting a greater Value on the ſew that are left, though the Degree of our Eſteem may be different. Nothing, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> is ſo melancholy a Circumſtance in human Life, or ſo ſoon reconciles us to to the Thought of our own Death, as the Reflection and Proſpect of one Friend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another dropping round us!

               <p>YOUR making a ſort of Apology for your not writing, is a very genteel reproof to me. I know I was to blame, but I know I did not intend to be ſo, and (what is the happieſt Knowledge in the World) I know you will forgive me: For ſure nothing is more ſatisfactory than to be certain of ſuch a Friend as will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look one's Failings, ſince every ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is a Conviction of his Kindneſs.</p>
               <p>If I am all my life to dwell in Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and never to riſe to Actions, I have but too much need of that gentle diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I experience in you. But I hope better things of myſelf, and fully purpoſe to make you a viſit this ſummer at <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn.</hi> I'm told you are all upon removal very ſpeedily, and that Mrs. <hi>Mary Digly</hi> talks in a Letter to Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> of ſeeing my Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi>'s Wood in her way. How much I wiſh to be her Guide thro' that enchanted Foreſt, is not to be expreſt: I look upon myſelf as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician appropriated to the place, without whom no mortal can penetrate into the Receſſes of thoſe ſacred Shades. I could paſs whole Days, in only deſcribing to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0096900700:285"/>
her the future, and as yet viſionary Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are to riſe in thoſe Scenes: The Palace that is to be built, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villions that are to glitter, the Colonnades that are to adorn them: Nay more, the meeting of the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Severn,</hi> which (when the noble Owner has finer Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's Embraces thro' ſecret Caverns of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till they riſe and openly celebrate their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the midſt of an immenſe Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre, which is to be the Admiration of Poſterity a hundred Years hence. But till the deſtin'd time ſhall arrive that is to manifeſt theſe Wonders, Mrs. <hi>Digly</hi> muſt content herſelf with ſeeing what is at preſent no more than the fineſt Wood in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Women of Quality are all turn'd Followers of the <hi>Camp</hi> in <hi>Hyde-Park</hi> this Year, whither all the Town reſort to magnificent Entertainments given by the Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Seythian</hi> Ladies that dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not more cloſely attached to the Luggage. The Matrons, like thoſe of <hi>Sparta,</hi> attend their Sons to the Field, to be the Witneſſes of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens

with all their Charms diſplay'd, provoke the Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee ſupply the place of <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> black Broth. This camp ſeems crowded with perpetual Victory, for every Sun that riſes in the Thunder of Cannon, ſets in the Muſick of Violins.

               <p>The Article you enquire of, is of as little Concern to me as you deſire it ſhou'd; namely the Railing Papers about the <hi>Odyſſey.</hi> If the Book has Merit, (and ſince you like it, it muſt) it will extinguiſh all ſuch naſty Scandal, as the Sun puts an end to ſtinks, meerly by <hi>coming out.</hi>

Not but Malice and Injuſtice have their Day, like ſome poor ſhort-liv'd Vermine, that die of ſhooting their own Stings. <hi>Falſhood is Folly</hi> (ſays <hi>Homer</hi>), and Liars and Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators at laſt hurt none but themſelves, even

in this World: In the next, 'tis Charity to ſay, God have Mercy on them! They were the Devil's Vice-gerents upon Earth, who is the Father of Lies, and I fear has a Right to diſpoſe of his Children.</p>
               <p>I've had an Occaſion to make theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of late, more juſtly than from any thing that concerns my Writings, for it is one that concerns my Morals, and (which I ought to be as tender of as my own) the good Character of another very innocent Perſon, who I'm ſure ſhares your Friendſhip no leſs than I do. ***** No Creature has better natural Diſpoſitions, or would act more rightly, or reaſonably, in every Duty, did ſhe act by herſelf, or from herſelf: But you know it is the Misfortune of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to be governed like a Ship, I mean the Head guided by the Tail, and that by every Wind that blows in it.</p>

a Life as you have been long accuſtomed to lead. As for Good Works, they are things I dare not name, either to thoſe that do them, or to thoſe that do them not; the firſt are too modeſt, and the latter too ſelfiſh, to bear the mention of what are become either too old faſhion'd or too private, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute any Part of the Vanity or Reputation of the preſent Age. However, it were to be wiſh'd People would now and then look upon Good Works as they do upon old Wardrobes, meerly in caſe any of 'em ſhould by chance come into Faſhion again; as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd Petticoats (which may be properly compar'd to Charities, as they cover a Multitude of Sins).</p>

I aſſure you, Men, Women, and Children, I have done with theſe things. Charity not only begins, but ends, at home.

               <p>I Know of nothing that will be ſo Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing to you at preſent, as ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the laſt Act of that eminent Comic Poet, and our Friend, <hi>Wycherley.</hi> He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would marry as ſoon as his life was deſpair'd of. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a few days before his Death he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the Ceremony; and join'd together thoſe two Sacraments which wiſe Men ſay ſhould be the laſt we receive; for if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0096900700:300"/>
Unction in our Catechiſm, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they are to be taken. The old Man then lay down, ſatisfy'd in the Conſcience of having, by this one Act paid his juſt Debts, obliged a Woman who (he was told) had Merit, and ſhewn a heroic reſentment of the ill uſage of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Debts; a Jointure of four hundred a year made her a Recompence; and the Nephew he left to comfort himſelf as well as he could, with the miſerable Remains of a mortgaged Eſtate. I ſaw our Friend twice after this was done, leſs peeviſh in his Sickneſs than he uſed to be in his Health; neither much afraid of dying, nor (which in him had been more likely) much aſhamed of marrying. The Evening before he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he called his young Wife to the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and earneſtly entreated her not to deny him one requeſt, the laſt he ſhould make. Upon her Aſſurances of conſenting to it, he told her, <hi>My Dear, it is only this; that you will never marry an old Man again.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help remarking, that Sickneſs which often deſtroys both Wit and Wiſdom, yet ſeldom has power to remove that Talent which we call <hi>Humour:</hi> Mr <hi>Wycherley</hi> ſhew'd his, even in this laſt Compliment; tho' I think his requeſt a little hard; for

               <p>I AM juſt return'd from the Country, whither Mr <hi>Rowe</hi> accompanied me, and paſs'd a Week in the Foreſt. I need not tell you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd me; but I muſt acquaint you there is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity and Gaiety of Diſpoſition almoſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him, which make it impoſſible to part from him without that uneaſineſs which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0096900700:302"/>
generally ſucceeds all our pleaſures. I have been juſt taking a ſolitary walk by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, full of reflections on the tranſitory na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all human delights; and giving my Thoughts a looſe in the contemplation of thoſe Satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taſte in the Company of ſeparate Spirits, when we ſhall range the walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and perhaps gaze on this World at as vaſt a diſtance as we now do on thoſe Worlds. The pleaſures we are to enjoy in that Converſation muſt undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Diſcoveries each ſhall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the Happineſs of Minds can ſurely be nothing but Knowledge.</p>
               <p>The higheſt Gratification we receive from Company is <hi>Mirth,</hi> which at the beſt is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that beats about the breaſt for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty.</p>
               <p>Keeping good Company, even the beſt, is but a leſs ſhameful Art of loſing Time</p>
               <p>What we here call <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi> are little better: The greater number of Arts to which we apply ourſelves are mere grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Dark; and even the ſearch of our moſt important Concerns in a future being, is but a needleſs, anxious, and uncertain haſte to be knowing, ſooner than we can,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0096900700:303"/>
what without all this ſollicitude we ſhall know a little later. We are but <hi>Curious Impertinents</hi> in the caſe of Futurity. 'Tis not our buſineſs to be gueſſing what the State of Souls ſhall be, but to be doing what may make our own State happy; We cannot be Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</p>
               <p>If this be my Notion of a great part of that high Science, Divinity; you will be ſo civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Streſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſt. Even of my darling Poetry I really make no other uſe, than Horſes of the Bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they toſs their Heads as if they were proud of 'em) only to jogg on a little more merrily.</p>
               <p>Your Obſervations on the narrow concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mankind in the point of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, confirm me in what I was ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as at my firſt knowledge of you to hope, and ſince ſo amply to experience. Let me take ſo much decent Pride and Dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons like theſe, which I diſcover'd in your Mind, I had never made the Trial I have done; which has ſucceeded ſo much to mine, and I believe not leſs to your Satisfaction: For if I know you right, your Pleaſure is greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</p>

Your Remark, that the Variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Politics or Religion is often rather a Gratification than Objection, to people who have Senſe enough to conſider the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful order of Nature in her Variations; makes me think you have not conſtrued <hi>Joannes Secundus</hi> wrong, in the Verſe which precedes that which you quote; <hi>Bene nota Fides,</hi> as I take it, does no way ſignify the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Religion, tho' <hi>Secundus</hi> was of it. I think it was generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worſhipping him, which divided the whole World. I am pretty ſure You and I ſhould no more make good <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Tyrants in Faith, than we could have been qualify'd for <hi>Lictors</hi> to <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> when he converted refractory Members with the Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you what I think I have formerly ſaid; that I as little fear God will damn a Man who has Charity, as I hope that any Prieſt can ſave him without it.</p>

               <p>I Find that a real Concern is not only a Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing too: The more time we give our ſelves to think over one's own, or a Friend's unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the more unable we grow to expreſs the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a Letter, at ſuch a Seaſon as this, as to retard a melancholy Viſit to a Perſon one cannot relieve. One is aſhamed in that Circumſtance, to pretend to entertain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with trifling, inſignificant affectations of Sorrow on the one hand, or unſeaſonable and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things ſacred; to treat ſo ſolemn a matter as a generous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Suffering, with Compliments or Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as your's has no need of being ſpirited up into Honour, or like a weak Woman, praiſed into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis enough to do and ſuffer what we ought; and Men ſhould know, that the noble pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Suffering bravely is as far above that of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemiſh'd Conſcience and inflexible Reſolution are
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0096900700:306"/>
above an accidental Flow of Spirits, or a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious Buſineſs of Mankind be included in Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures; there are now ſome People who give us the Opportunity of affording as bright an Example in practiſing the one, as themſelves have given an infamous Inſtance of the Violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has always this Comfort when he is oppreſt, that he knows himſelf to be ſuperior to thoſe who injure him: For the greateſt Power on Earth can no ſooner do him that Injury, but the brave Man can make himſelf greater by forgiving it.</p>
               <p>If it were generous to ſeek for allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Conſolations in a Calamity of ſo much Glory, one might ſay that to be ruin'd thus in the Groſs, with a whole People, is but like periſhing in the General Conflagration, where nothing we can value is left behind us.</p>
               <p>Methinks in our preſent Condition, the moſt heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's Load, and (oppreſt as we are) to ſuccour ſuch as are yet more oppreſt. If there are too many who cannot be aſſiſted but by what we cannot give, our Money; there are yet others who may be relieved by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, by our Countenance, and even by our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0096900700:307"/>
Chearfulneſs. The Misfortunes of private Families, the Miſunderſtandings of People whom Diſtreſſes make ſuſpicious, the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Relations whom Change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may diſ unite, or the Neceſſities of half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruin'd Eſtates render unkind to each other; theſe at leaſt may be ſoften'd in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by a general well-manag'd Humanity among ourſelves, if all thoſe who have your Principles of Belief, had alſo your Senſe and Conduct. But indeed moſt of 'em have given lamentable <note n="*" place="bottom">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <hi>Preſton.</hi>
                  </note> proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want Senſe, are only religious thro' Weakneſs, and good-natur'd thro' Shame: Theſe are narrow-minded Creatures that never deal in Eſſentials; their Faith never looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Ceremonials, nor their Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any diſtreſſed, conſcientious <hi>French</hi> Refugee at this inſtant: what muſt my Concern then be, when I perceive ſo many Anxieties now tearing thoſe Hearts which I have deſired a place in, and Clouds of Melancholy riſing on thoſe Faces which I have long look'd upon with Affection? I begin already to feel both what ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and what others are yet too ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0096900700:308"/>
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old, for ſo many additional Inconveniences, and Chagrins, more than their ſmall Remain of Life ſeem'd deſtin'd to undergo; and with the Young, for ſo many of thoſe Gayeties and Pleaſures (the Portion of Youth) which they will by this means be depriv'd of.

Intervals, neither interrupting their own Employments, nor altogether careleſs of ours: but in general conſtantly wiſhing us well, and hoping to have us one day in their Company.</p>
               <p>To grow indifferent to the World is to grow Philoſophical, or Religious; (which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of thoſe Turns we chance to take) and indeed the World is ſuch a thing as one that thinks pretty much, muſt either laugh at, or be angry with: But if we laugh at it, they ſay we are proud; and if we are angry with it, they ſay we are ill-natur'd. So the moſt politic Way is to ſeem always better pleas'd than one can be, greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, greater Lovers, and in ſhort greater Fools, than we really are: So ſhall we live comfortably with our Families, quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd by our Maſters, and happy with our Miſtreſſes.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0096900700:312"/>
well in it: And I hope you have received your Reward, in being happy where you are. I believe, in the Religious Country you now inhabit, you'll be better pleas'd to find I conſider you in this light, than if I compared you to thoſe <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Conſtancy in ſuffering Pain, and whoſe Reſolution in purſuit of a generous End, you would rather imitate than boaſt of.</p>
               <p>But I had a melancholy hint the other day, as if you were yet a Martyr to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue your Virtue made you undergo on this ſide the Water. I beg if your health be reſtor'd to you, not to deny me the Joy of knowing it: Your endeavours of Service and good Advices to the poor Papiſts, put me in mind of <hi>Noah's</hi> preaching forty years to thoſe folks that were to be drowned at laſt. At the worſt I heartily wiſh your Ark may find an <hi>Ararat,</hi> and the Wife and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, (the hopes of the good Patriarch) land ſafely after the Deluge upon the Shore of <hi>Totneſs.</hi>

               <p>If I durſt mix prophane with ſacred Hiſtory, I would chear you with the old Tale of <hi>Brutus</hi> the wandering <hi>Trojan,</hi> who found on that very Coaſt the happy End of his Peregrinations and Adventures.</p>
               <p>I have very lately read <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> (to whom your <hi>Cornwall</hi> is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholden) in the Tranſlation of a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0096900700:313"/>
in my neighbourhood. The poor Man is highly concerned to vindicate <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery</hi>'s veracity as an Hiſtorian; and tole me he was perfectly aſtoniſhed, we of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion could doubt of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends of his Giants, while we believ'd thoſe of our Saints? I am forced to make a fair Compoſition with him; and, by crediting ſome of the Wonders of <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magog,</hi> have brought him ſo far already, that he ſpeaks reſpectfully of St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>'s carrying Chriſt, and the Reſuſcitation of St. <hi>Nicholas Tolentine</hi>'s Chickens. Thus we proceed apace in converting each other from all manner of Infidelity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> are no more, compared to <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> than the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Ghibellines</hi> were to the <hi>Mohocks</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdreadful memory.

               <p>You'll excuſe all this trifling, or any thing elſe which prevents a Sheet full of Compliment: And believe there is nothing more true (even more true than any thing in <hi>Jeffery</hi> is falſe) than that I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Affection for you, and am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me here, for I have been in and about this Country ever ſince your departure. I am pleas'd to date this from a place ſo well known to Mrs. <hi>Blount,</hi> where I write as if I were dictated by her Anceſtors, whoſe faces are all upon me. I fear none ſo much as Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Guiſe,</hi> who being in his Shirt, ſeems as ready to combate me, as her own Sir <hi>John</hi> was to demoliſh Duke <hi>Lancaſtere.</hi> I dare ſay your Lady will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect his Figure. I look'd upon the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Walls, and Terraces; the Plantations, and Slopes, which Nature has made to command a variety of Valleys and riſing Woods; with a Veneration mixt with a Pleaſure, that repreſented her to me in thoſe puerile Amuſements, which engaged her ſo many Years ago in this place: I fancy'd I ſaw her ſober over a Sampler, or gay over a jointed Baby. I dare ſay ſhe did one thing more, even in thoſe early
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0096900700:317"/>
times; <hi>remember'd her Creator in the Days of her Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You deſcribe ſo well your Heremitical ſtate of Life, that none of the antient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorites could go beyond you, for a Cave in a Rock, with a fine Spring, or any of the Accommodations that befit a Solitary. Only I don't remember to have read, that any of thoſe venerable and holy Perſonages took with them a Lady, and begat Sons and Daughters. You muſt modeſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be accounted a Patriarch. But were you a little younger, I ſhould rather rank you with Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> and his fellows. If Piety be ſo Romantick, I ſhall turn Hermit in good earneſt; for I ſee one may go ſo far as to be Poetical, and hope to ſave one's Soul at the ſame time. I really wiſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomething more, that is, a Prophet; for I wiſh I were as <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> to be taken by the Hair of the Head, and viſit <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Den. You are very obliging in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have now a whole Family upon my hands, to whom to diſcharge the part of a Friend: I aſſure you I like 'em all ſo well, that I will never quit my Hereditary Right to them; you have made me yours, and conſequently them mine.

I ſhould have elſe been ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and deeply affected, in the thought of your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a private Letter of <hi>Montaigne,</hi> giving an account of the laſt words of an intimate Friend of his: <q rend="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain I feel will ſoon be over, but I grieve for

               <p>I join with your Family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer. The Comforts you receive from their Attendance put me in mind of what old <hi>Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Saltoune</hi> ſaid one day to me: <q rend="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to die; I am a poor Individual; no Creature to wiſh, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only reaſon I have to repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſingle Man; now I grow old, I am like a Tree without a Prop, and without young Trees of my own ſhedding, to grow round me, for Company and Defence.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>I hope the Gout will ſoon go after the Fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an Interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards, except the Gout. Pray come, and never ſtir from us again. Do away your dirty Acres, caſt 'em to dirty People, ſuch as in the Scripture-Phraſe <hi>poſſeſs the Land.</hi> Shake off your Earth like the noble Animal in <hi>Milton.</hi>

When you ſhut the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the inſtant, from a luminous Room, a <hi>Camera obſcura;</hi> on the Walls of which all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats, are forming a moving Picture in their viſible Radiations: And when you have a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different Scene: it is finiſhed with Shells interperſed with Pieces of Looking-glaſs in angular forms; and in the Ceiling is a Star of the ſame Material, at which when a Lamp (of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicular Figure of thin Alabaſter) is hung in the Middle, a thouſand pointed Rays glitter and are reflected over the Place. There are connected to this Grotto by a narrower Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one toward the River, of ſmooth Stones, full of light and open; the other toward the Arch of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints, and Iron Ore. The Bottom is paved with ſimple Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to the Temple, is to be Cockle-ſhells, in the natural Taſte, agreeing not ill with the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic Idea of the whole Place.

               <p>I Should be aſham'd to own the receipt of a very kind Letter from you, two whole Months from the date of this; if I were not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0096900700:326"/>
more aſham'd to tell a Lye, or to make an Excuſe, which is worſe than a Lye (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built upon ſome probable Circumſtance, it makes uſe of a degree of Truth to falſity with: It is a Lye <hi>Guarded</hi>). Your Letter has been in my Pocket in conſtant wearing, till that, and the Pocket, and the Suit, are worn out; by which means, I have read it forty times, and I find by ſo doing, that I have not enough conſider'd, and reflected upon many others you have obliged me with; for true Friendſhip, as they ſay of good Writing, will bear reviewing a thouſand times, and ſtill diſcover new beauties.</p>
               <p>I have had a Fever, a ſhort one, but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent: I am now well. So it ſhall take up no more of this Paper.</p>
               <p>I begin now to expect you in Town, to make the Winter to come more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us both. The Summer is a kind of Heaven, when we wander in a Paradiſaical Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens; but at this Seaſon, we are like our poor firſt Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life, and forc'd to look about for more people to help to bear our labours, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warmer Houſes, and hive together in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>I hope you are long ſince perfectly reſtor'd, and riſen from your Gout, happy in the delights of a contented Family, ſmiling at
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0096900700:327"/>
Storms, laughing at Greatneſs, and merry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Chriſtmas-fire, exerciſing all the Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an old Patriarch in Charity and Hoſpitality. I will not tell Mrs <hi>B.</hi> what I think ſhe is doing; for I conclude it is her opinion, that he only ought to know it for whom it is done: and ſhe will allow herſelf to be far enough advanc'd above a fine La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not to deſire to ſhine before Men.</p>
               <p>Your Daughters perhaps may have ſome other thoughts, which even their Mother muſt excuſe them for, becauſe ſhe is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will not however ſuppoſe thoſe thoughts get the better of their Devotions, but rather excite 'em, and aſſiſt the warmth of them; while their Prayer may be, that they may raiſe up and breed as irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a young Family as their Parents have done. In a Word, I fancy you all well, eaſy, and happy, juſt as I wiſh you; and next to that I wiſh you all with me.</p>
               <p>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in dignity, and next in value. <hi>Minuiſti eum paullo minus ab Angelis.</hi> If therefore I wiſh well to the good and the deſerving, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire They only ſhou'd be my Companions and Correſpondents; I muſt very ſoon, and very much think of you. I want your Company, and your Example. Pray make haſte to Town, ſo as not again to leave us: Diſcharge the Load of Earth that lies on you,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0096900700:328"/>
like one of the Mountains under which the Poets ſay the Giants (that is, the <hi>Men of the Earth</hi>) are whelmed: Leave Earth to the Sons of Earth; your Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Which that it may be accompliſh'd in us all, is the Prayer of him who maketh this ſhort Sermon. Value (to you) Three Pence. Adieu.</p>

               <p>YOU writ me a very kind Letter ſome months ago, and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> That hindered my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering you, and I have ſince ſeveral times inquir'd of you, without any Satisfaction; for ſo I call the knowledge of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, or of any thing that concerns you.

Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> too has been ſilent all this year; I believe he has been diſpleas'd at ſome or other of my Freedoms; which I very innocently take, and moſt with thoſe I think moſt my friends. But this I know nothing of; perhaps he may have open'd to you: And, if I know you right, you are of a Temper to cement Friendſhips, and not to divide them. I really much love Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and have a true affection for your ſelf, which if I had any Intereſt in the world, or Power with thoſe who have, I ſhou'd not be long without manifeſting to you. I deſire you will not, either out of Modeſty, or a vicious Diſtruſt of another's value for you, (thoſe two Eternal Foes to Merit) imagine that your Letters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation are not always welcome to me.

               <p>IT has been my good fortune within this month paſt, to hear more things that have pleas'd me than (I think) almoſt in all my time beſide. But nothing upon my word has been ſo Home-felt a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as the News you tell me of your ſelf: and you are not in the leaſt miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when you congratulate me upon your own good Succeſs; for I have more People to be happy out of, than any ill-natur'd man can boaſt I may with honeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to you, that notwithſtanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inconveniencies and Diſadvantages they commonly talk of in the <hi>Res anguſti domi,</hi> I have never found any other, than the inability of giving people of Merit the only certain proof of our value for them, in doing 'em ſome real ſervice.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0096900700:333"/>

Every Corner of an Eye, or Turn of a Noſe or Ear, the ſmalleſt degree of Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have charms to diſtract me. I no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er look upon Lord <hi>Plauſible</hi> as ridiculous, for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear and pretty Elbow (as the <hi>Plain-dealer</hi> has it) but am in ſome danger even from the Ugly and Diſagreeable, ſince they may have their retired beauties, in one Trait or other about 'em. You may gueſs in how uneaſy a ſtate I am, when every day the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I have thrown away three Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>'s, each of which was once my vanity, two Lady <hi>Bridgewaters,</hi> a Dutcheſs of <hi>Montague,</hi> beſides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight of the Garter. I have crucify'd <hi>Chriſt</hi> over again in effigie, and made a <hi>Madona</hi> as old as her Mother St. <hi>Anne.</hi> Nay, what is yet more miraculous, I have rival'd St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf in Painting, and as 'tis ſaid

an Angel came and finiſh'd his Piece, ſo you would ſwear a Devil put the laſt hand to mine, 'tis ſo begrim'd and ſmutted. However, I comfort my ſelf with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reflection, that I have not broken the Commandment, for my Pictures are not the likeneſs of any thing in heaven above, or in earth below, or in the waters under the earth.

               <p>WElcome to your native Soil! wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to your Friends! thrice wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me! whether return'd in glory, bleſt with Court-intereſt, the love and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Great, and fill'd with agreeable Hopes; or melancholy with Dejection, contemplative of the changes of Fortune, and doubtful for the future: Whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd a triumphant <hi>Whig,</hi> or a deſponding <hi>Tory,</hi> equally All Hail! equally beloved and welcome to me! If happy, I am to ſhare in your elevation; if unhappy, you have ſtill a warm corner in my heart, and a retreat at <hi>Binfield</hi> in the worſt of times at your ſervice. If you are a <hi>Tory,</hi> or thought ſo by any man, I know it can proceed from nothing but your Gratitude
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0096900700:340"/>
to a few People, who endeavour'd to ſerve you, and whoſe Politicks were never your Concern. If you are a <hi>Whig,</hi> as I rather hope, and as I think your Principles and mine (as Brother Poets) had ever a Byaſs to the Side of Liberty, I know you will be an honeſt man and an inoffenſive one. Upon the whole, I know you are incapable of being ſo much of either Party as to be good for nothing. Therefore once more, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, or in whatever ſtate you are, All Hail!</p>
               <p>One or two of your old Friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd they had heard nothing from you ſince the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Death; I told 'em, no man living lov'd Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> better than I, yet I had not once written to him in all his Voyage. This I thought a convincing proof, how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him ſo every month. But they had reaſons too themſelves to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in your excuſe, as men who really value one another will never want ſuch as make their friends and themſelves eaſy. The late univerſal Concern in publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, threw us all into a hurry of Spirits; even I, who am more a Philoſopher than to expect any thing from any Reign, was born away with the current, and full of the expectation of the Succeſſor: During your Journeys I knew not whither to aim
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0096900700:341"/>
a letter after you, that was a ſort of ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flying: add to this the demand <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had upon me, to write fifty Verſes a day, beſides learned Notes, all which are at a concluſion for this year. Rejoice with me, O my Friend, that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is over; come and make merry with me in much Feaſting, for I to thee, and thou to me. We will feed among the Lilies. By the Lilies, I mean the Ladies, with whom I hope you have fed to Satiety: Haſt thou paſſed through many Countries, and not taſted the delights thereof? Haſt thou not left to thy Iſſue in divers Lands, that <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Gays</hi> and <hi>Dutch Gays</hi> may ariſe, to write Paſtorals, and ſing their Songs in ſtrange Countries? Are not the <hi>Blouzelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi> of the <hi>Hague</hi> as charming as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalinda's</hi> of <hi>Britain?</hi> or have the two great Paſtoral Poets of our Nation renounced Love at the ſame time? for <hi>Philips,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Philips, Hanover Philips,</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, yea and in a ruſtick manner kicked his <hi>Roſalind.</hi>—Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and I have been inſeparable ever ſince you went.

               <p>Pardon me if I add a word of advice in the Poetical way. Write ſomething on the King, or Prince, or Princeſs. On whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever foot you may be with the Court, this can do no harm—I ſhall never know where to end, and am confounded in the many things I have to ſay to you, tho' they all amount but to this, that I am entirely, as ever,</p>

               <p>I AM extremely glad to find by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your's to Mr. <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> that you have receiv'd one from me; and I beg you to keep, as the greateſt of Curioſities, that Letter of mine which you receiv'd and I never writ.</p>
               <p>But the Truth is, that we were made here to expect you in a ſhort time, that I was upon the Ramble moſt part of the Summer, and have concluded the Seaſon in Grief, for the death of my poor father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0096900700:343"/>
I ſhall not enter into a detail of my Concerns and Troubles, for two reaſons; becauſe I am really afflicted and need no Airs of grief, and becauſe they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my ſelf. But I think you (without too great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment) enough my friend, to be pleas'd to know he died eaſily, without a groan, or the ſickneſs of two minutes; in a word, as ſilently and peacefully as he lived.</p>

                  <l>Sic mihi contingat vivere, ſicque mori!</l>
               </q>
               <p>I am not in the humour to ſay gay things, nor in the affectation of avoiding them. I can't pretend to entertain either Mr. <hi>Pulteney</hi> or you, as you have done both my Lord <hi>Burlington</hi> and me, by your letter to Mr. <hi>Lowndes.</hi> I am only ſorry you have no greater quarrel to Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> and wiſh you paid ſome hundreds a year to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax. That Gentleman is lately become an inoffenſive perſon to me too; ſo that we may join heartily in our Addreſſes to him, and (like true Patriots) rejoice in all that Good done to the Nation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which we contribute nothing our ſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not forget to acknowledge your letter ſent from <hi>Aix;</hi> you told me then, that writing was not good with the Waters,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0096900700:344"/>
and I find ſince you are of my opinion, that 'tis as bad without the Waters. But I fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that is ſo bad with the Waters; and then you might write without any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, if you writ like our Brother-poets of theſe days.</p>
               <p>I have no ſtory to tell that is worth your hearing: you know I am no man of Intrigue; but the Ducheſs of <hi>Hamilton</hi> has one which ſhe ſays is worth my hearing, that relates to Mr. <hi>Pulteney</hi> and your ſelf; and which ſhe promiſes, if you won't tell me, ſhe will.

I would ſend my ſervices to Mr. <hi>Pulteney,</hi> but that he is out of favour at Court; and make ſome compliment to Mrs. <hi>Pulteney,</hi> if ſhe were not a Wig. My Lord <hi>Burlington</hi> tells me ſhe has as much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhin'd all the <hi>French</hi> Ladies, as ſhe did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> before: I am ſorry for it, becauſe it will be detrimental to our holy Religion, if heretical Women ſhould eclypſe thoſe

               <p>I Think it obliging in you to deſire an account of my health. The truth is, I have never been in a worſe ſtate in my life, and find whatever I have try'd as a remedy, ſo ineffectual, that I give myſelf entirely over.

I am always glad to hear often from you; always glad to ſee you, whatever acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents amuſements have interven'd to make me do either leſs than uſual. I not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently think of you, but conſtantly do my beſt to make others do it, by mentioning

Let Time convince thoſe who know me not, that I am an inoffenſive perſon; tho' (to ſay truth) I don't care how little I am indebted to Time, for the World is hardly worth living in, at leaſt to one that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have health a week together. I have been made to expect Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> in town this fortnight, or elſe I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to him. If he, by never writing to me, ſeems to forget me, I conſider I do the ſame ſeemingly to him, and yet I don't believe he has a more ſincere friend in the world than I am; therefore I will think him mine.

               <p>I Thank you for remembring me. I would do my beſt to forget my ſelf, but that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0096900700:347"/>
I find your Idea is ſo cloſely connected to me that I muſt forget both together, or neither. I'm ſorry, I could not have a glympſe either of you, or of the Sun, (your Father) before you went for <hi>Bath.</hi> But now it pleaſes me to ſee him, and hear of you. Pray put Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> in mind that he has one on this ſide of the World who loves him; and that there are more Men and Women in the Univerſe, than Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> and my Lady Ducheſs of <hi>M.</hi> There are Ladies in and about <hi>Richmond</hi> that pretend to value him and your ſelf; and one of 'em at leaſt may be thought to do it without Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, namely Mrs. <hi>Howard.</hi> As for Mrs. <hi>Blounts</hi> (whom you mercifully make mention of) they are gone, or going to <hi>Suſſex.</hi> I hope Mrs. <hi>Pulteney</hi> is the better for the <hi>Bath,</hi> tho' I have little Charity and few good Wiſhes for the Ladies, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of their beſt friends the Men. Pray tell her ſhe has forgot the firſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſon I ever troubled her with, and therefore it ſhall be the laſt (the very thing I fear the deſires). Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> is a ſtrange creature; he goes out of town, and leaves his Baſtards at other folks doors. I have long been ſo far miſtaken in him as to think him a Man of Morals as well as of Politicks. Pray let him know I made a very unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable enquiry t'other day of the welfare
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0096900700:348"/>
of his Wife and family: Things that (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) are below the conſideration of a Wit and an <hi>Omore</hi>-player. They are in perfect health. Tho' Mrs. <hi>A<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Now I ſpeak of thoſe Regions about the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> pray, dear <hi>Gay,</hi> conſult with him and Dr. <hi>Che e</hi> to what exact pitch yours may be ſuffer'd to ſwell, not to outgrow theirs, who are, yet, your Betters. Pray tell Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> that even Pigeon-pyes, and Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puddings are thought dangerous by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; for thoſe that have been ſent to the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> are open'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely pry'd into at the <hi>Tower:</hi> 'Tis the firſt time dead Pigeons have been ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of carrying Intelligence. To be ſerious, you, and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> (nay and the Doctor if he has not dined) will be ſenſible of my concern and ſurprize at the commitment of that Gentleman, whoſe welfare is as much my concern as any friend's I have. I think my ſelf a moſt unfortunate wretch; I no ſooner love, and, upon knowledge, fix my eſteem to any man; but he either dies like Mr. <hi>Craggs,</hi> or is ſ nt to Impriſonment like the Biſhop. God ſend him as well as I wiſh him, manifeſt him to be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as I believe him, and make all his Enemies know him as well as I do, that

they may love him and think of him as well!</p>

I have conſtantly had particular accounts of you from the Doctor, which have not ceas'd to alarm me yet. God preſerve your life, and reſtore your health.

If, as I believe, the air of a better clime as the Southern Part of <hi>France,</hi> may be thought uſeful for your recovery, thither I would go with you infallibly; and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable we might get the Dean with us, who is in that abandon'd ſtate already in which I ſhall ſhortly be, as to other Cares and Duties.

I ſo well remember the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation you were to me in my Mother's former Illneſs, that it doubles my Concern at this time not to be able to be with you, or you able to be with me. Had I loſt her, I wou'd have been no where elſe but with you during your confinement. I have now paſt five weeks without once going from home, and without any company but for three or four of the days. Friends rarely ſtretch their kindneſs ſo far as ten miles. My Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> have not forgotten to viſit me: the reſt (except Mrs. <hi>Blount</hi> once) were contented to ſend meſſages.

               <p>IF my friendſhip were as effectual as it is ſincere, you would be one of thoſe people who would be vaſtly advantag'd and enrich'd by it.

My only conſolation is to think you happier than myſelf, and to begin to envy you, which is next to hating (an excellent Remedy for Love.) How comes it that Providence has been ſo unkind to me, (who am a greater object of compaſſion than any fat man alive) that I am forc'd to drink wine, while you

               <p>I AM ſomething like the Sun at this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, withdrawing from the World, but meaning it mighty well, and reſolving to ſhine whenever I can again. But I fear the Clouds of a long Winter will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me to ſuch a degree, that any body will take a farthing-candle for a better Guide, and more ſerviceable companion. My Friends may remember my brighter days, but will think (like the <hi>Iriſhman</hi>) that the <hi>Moon</hi> is a better thing when once I am gone. I don't ſay this with any alluſion to my Poetical capacity as a Son of <hi>Apolio,</hi> but in my Companionable one, (if you'll ſuffer me to uſe a phraſe of the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s) For I ſhall ſee or be ſeen of few of you, this Winter. I am grown too faint to do any good, or to give any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I not only, as <hi>Dryden</hi> fairly ſays, <hi>Feel my Notes decay</hi> as a Poet; but feel my Spirits flag as a Companion, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to where I firſt began, my Books.

               <p>Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a Beatify'd Spirit, comparing your life with my ſtupid ſtate. For as to my living at <hi>Windſor</hi> with Ladies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is all a dream; I was there but two nights and all the day out of that company. I ſhall certainly make as little Court to others, as they do to me; and that will be none at all.

Had the Writer attack'd <hi>Vice,</hi> at a Time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant, and ſo far from being concealed as a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> that it is proclaimed with Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a <hi>Merit;</hi> I ſhould have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the Conſequence: Had he ſatirized Gameſters of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds Fortune, acquired by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as are in daily practice, and almoſt univerſally encouraged: Had he overwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſended the <hi>Religion of his Country,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Books as come from every Preſs, are publickly vended in every Shop, and greedily bought by almoſt every Rank of Men; or had he called our excellent <hi>Weekly Writers</hi> by the ſame Names which they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly beſtow on the greateſt Men <hi>in</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and <hi>out</hi> of the Miniſtry, for which they are all unpuniſhed, and moſt rewarded:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0096900700:368"/>
In any of theſe Caſes, indeed, I might have judged him too preſumptuous, and perhaps have trembled for his Raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>I could not but hope better for this ſmall and modeſt Epiſtle, which attacks <hi>no one Vice</hi> whatſoever; which deals only in <hi>Folly,</hi> and not Folly in general, but a ſingle Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it; that only Branch, for the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written muſt neceſſarily be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. I fancied it might eſcape Cenſure, eſpecially ſeeing how tenderly theſe Follies are treated, and really leſs accuſed, than Apologized for. <q>
                     <l>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</l>
                     <l>Health to himſelf, and to his Infants Bread</l>
                     <l>The Lab'rer bears.</l>
                  </q>Is this ſuch a <hi>Crime,</hi> that to impute it to a Man muſt be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an <hi>Innocent Folly,</hi> and much more <hi>Beneficent</hi> than the Want of it; for <hi>Ill Taſte</hi> employs more hands, and diffuſes Expence more than a <hi>Good</hi> one. Is it a <hi>Moral</hi> Defect? No, it is but a <hi>Natural</hi> one; a <hi>Want of Taſte.</hi> It is what the beſt good Man living may be liable to: The worthieſt Peer may live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily in an ill-favour'd Houſe, and the beſt reputed Citizen be pleaſed with a vile Garden. I thought (I ſay) the Author had
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0096900700:369"/>
the common Liberty to obſerve a Defect, and to compliment a Friend for a Quality that diſtinguiſhes him: which I know not how any Quality ſhould do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</p>
               <p>But, they ſay, the Satire is <hi>Perſonal.</hi> I thought it could not be ſo, becauſe all its Reflexions are on <hi>Things.</hi> His Reflexions are not on the <hi>Man,</hi> but his Houſe, Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, he reſpects (as one may ſay) the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the Nile and the Triton: He is only ſorry to ſee them (as he might be to ſee any of his <hi>Friends</hi>) ridiculous, by being in the wrong Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy, that to ſay a Thing is <hi>Perſonal,</hi> is the ſame as to ſay it is <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> not conſidering, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be <hi>Juſt</hi> that, is not <hi>Perſonal.</hi> I am afraid that <q rend="inline">"all ſuch Writings and Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as <hi>touch no Man,</hi> will <hi>mend no Man.</hi>"</q> The Good-Natured, indeed, are apt to be alarmed at any thing like Satire; and the <hi>Guilty</hi> readily concur with the <hi>Weak</hi> for a plain Reaſon, becauſe the Vicious look upon Folly as their <hi>Frontier:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Jam proximus ardet</l>

No wonder thoſe who know Ridicule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, find an inward Conſolation
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0096900700:370"/>
in removing it from themſelves as far as they can; and it is never ſo far, as when they can get it fixed on the <hi>beſt Characters.</hi> No wonder thoſe who are Food for Satiriſts, ſhould rail at them as Creatures of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> every Beaſt born for our Uſe would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to call a Man ſo.</p>
               <p>I know no Remedy, unleſs people in our Age would as little frequent the Theatres, as they begin to do the Churches; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Comedy were forſaken, Satire ſilent, and every man left to do what ſeems good in his own Eyes, as if there were no King, no Prieſt, no Poet in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I find myſelf obliged to touch a Point, on which I muſt be more ſerious; it well deſerves I ſhould: I mean the malicious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Character of <hi>Timon,</hi> which I will boldly ſay, they would impute to the Perſon the moſt different in the World from a <hi>Man-hater,</hi> and the Perſon whoſe <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Encouragement</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> have often been ſhewn in the <hi>righteſt Place.</hi> The Author of that Epiſtle muſt certainly think ſo, if he has the ſame Opinion of his own Merit as Authors generally have; for he has been favoured by this very Perſon.</p>
               <p>Why, in God's Name, muſt a <hi>Portrait,</hi> apparently collected from twenty different Men, be applied to one only? Has it his <hi>Eye?</hi> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <hi>Noſe</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0096900700:371"/>
or <hi>Mouth?</hi> No, they are totally differing. What then, I beſeech you? Why, it has the <hi>Mole on his Chin.</hi> Very well; but muſt the Picture therefore be his, and has no other man that Blemiſh?</p>
               <p>Could there be a more melancholy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance how much the Taſte of the Publick is vitiated, and turns the moſt ſalutary and ſeaſonable Phyſick into Poiſon, than if amidſt the Blaze of a thouſand bright Qualities in a Great Man, they ſhould only remark there is a <hi>Shadow</hi> about him, as what Eminence is without? I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the Author was incapable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting any ſuch to One, whoſe whole Life (to uſe his own Expreſſion in Print of him) is <hi>a continued Series</hi> of good and generous Actions.</p>
               <p>I know no man who would be more concerned, if he gave the leaſt Pain or Offence to any innocent Perſon; and none who would be leſs concerned, if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it, If ever that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, I dare engage he will own it, with all the Freedom of one whoſe <hi>Cenſures</hi> are <hi>juſt,</hi> and who ſets his <hi>Name</hi> to them.</p>

               <p>THE Clamour rais'd about my Epiſtle to you, could not give me ſo much pain, as I receiv'd pleaſure in ſeeing the general Zeal of the world in the cauſe of a great Man who is Beneficent, and the particular Warmth of your Lordſhip in that of a private Man who is innocent.</p>
               <p>It was not the <hi>Poem</hi> that deſerv'd this from you; for as I had the Honour to be your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like a Poet: but ſure the <hi>Writer</hi> deſerv'd more Candor, even from thoſe who knew him not, than to promote a Report, which in regard to that Noble Perſon was <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;</hi> in regard to me, <hi>Villainous.</hi> Yet I had no great cauſe to wonder, that a Character belonging to <hi>twenty</hi> ſhou'd be applied to <hi>one;</hi> ſince, by that means, <hi>nineteen</hi> wou'd eſcape the Ridicule.</p>
               <p>I was too well content with my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Noble Perſon's Opinion in this Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But

ſince Malice and Miſtake are ſo long a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have taken the opportunity of a third Edition to declare <hi>His Belief,</hi> not only of <hi>My Innocence,</hi> but of <hi>Their Malignity,</hi> of the former of which my own heart is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious, as I fear ſome of theirs muſt be of the latter.

               <p>I Little doubt of your kind Concern for me, nor of that of the Lady you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have nothing to repay my Friends with at preſent, but prayers and good wiſhes. I have the ſatisfaction to find that I am as officiouſly ſerv'd by my Friends, as he that has thouſands to leave in Legacies; beſides the Aſſurance of their Sincerity,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0096900700:375"/>
God Almighty has made my bodily diſtreſs as eaſy as a thing of that nature can be: I have found ſome relief, at leaſt ſometimes, from the Air of this Place. My Nights are bad, but many poor Creatures have worſe.</p>
               <p>As for you, my good Friend, I think ſince our firſt acquaintance there has not been any of thoſe little Suſpicions or Jealouſies that often affect the ſincereſt Friendſhips; I am ſure not on my ſide. I muſt be ſo ſincere as to own, that tho' I could not help valuing you for thoſe Talents which the World prizes, yet they were not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my Friendſhip: They were quite of another ſort; nor ſhall I at preſent offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my Laſt Requeſt, that you continue that noble <hi>Diſdain</hi> and <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of Vice, which you ſeem naturally endu'd with, but ſtill with a due regard to your own Safety; and ſtudy more to reform than chaſtiſe, tho' the one often cannot be effected without the other.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Bathurſt</hi> I have always honour'd for every good Quality, that a Perſon of his Rank ought to have: Pray give my Reſpects and kindeſt Wiſhes to the Family.

               <p>I Believe it was with me when I left the Town, as it is with a great many Men when they leave the World, whoſe loſs itſelf they do not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, as that of their Friends whom they leave behind in it. For I do not know one thing for which I can envy <hi>London,</hi> but for your continuing there. Yet I gueſs you

However, I will confeſs myſelf the leſs concern'd on that account, becauſe I have no very violent Inclination to loſe my Heart, eſpecially in ſo wild and ſavage a place as this Foreſt is: In the Town, 'tis ten to one but a young Fellow may find his ſtray'd Heart again, with ſome <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> or <hi>Drury-lane</hi> Damfel; but here, where I could have met with no redreſs from an unmerciful, virtuous Dame, I muſt for ever have loſt my little Traveller in a Hole, where I could never rummage to find him again.—Well, Sir, you have your Lady in the Town ſtill, and I have my Heart in the Country ſtill, which being wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more room in it for my Friends, and does not want a Corner at your Service.—To be ſerious, you have extremely oblig'd me by your Frankneſs and Kindneſs to me: And if I have abus'd it by too much Freedom on my part, I hope you will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to the natural Openneſs of my Temper, which hardly knows how to ſhow Reſpect, where I feel Affection. I wou'd love my Friend, as my Miſtreſs, without Ceremony; and hope a little rough Uſage

ſometimes may not be more diſpleaſing to the one, than it is to the other.</p>

               <p>I Have been ſo well ſatisfy'd with the Country ever ſince I ſaw you, that I have not ſo much as once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it beſides Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> and yourſelf. And from him I underſtand of your Journey this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into <hi>Leiceſterſhire;</hi> from whence I gueſs you are return'd by this time, to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your old Buſineſs of comparing Critics, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0096900700:383"/>
reconciling commentators; and to the old diverſions of a loſing game at Picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the theatre; where you are none of the malicious Audience, but the chief of amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of one <note n="*" place="bottom">His Hearing.</note>Senſe which there for the moſt part could only ſerve to diſguſt you, enjoy the vigour of another which raviſhes you.
<q>
                     <l>You know when one Senſe is ſuppreſt,</l>
                     <l>It but retires into the reſt.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>(According to the poetical, not the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Dodwell;</hi> who has done one thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not nonſenſe!) So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the Boxes, without being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any of the dulneſs of the Stage. You are ſo good a critic, that 'tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works; and next, that you are not ſo arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the reſt) without hearing. But now I talk of thoſe critics, I have good news to tell you concerning myſelf, for which I expect you ſhou'd congratulate with me: It is, that beyond all my expectations, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0096900700:384"/>
far above my demerits, I have been moſt mercifully repriev'd by the ſovereign power of <hi>Jacob Tonſon,</hi> from being brought forth to publick puniſhment; and reſpited from time to time from the hands of thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous executioners of the Muſes, whom I was juſt now ſpeaking of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver themſelves into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their diſadvantage; and not out of any Ambition to ſpread their fame, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executed in the face of the world, which is a fame but of ſhort continuance. That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to preſerve his for ninety-nine years; for thoſe names very rarely laſt ſo many days, which are planted either in <hi>Jacob Tonſon</hi>'s, or the <hi>Ordinary of Newgate</hi>'s Miſcellanies.</p>
               <p>I have an hundred things to ſay to you, which ſhall be deferr'd till I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſeeing you in town; for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to you by Letters before this, if I had not been uncertain were you paſs'd your time the laſt ſeaſon: ſo much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the pleaſure you cou'd deſire from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0096900700:385"/>
and your own thoughts the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in it. But nothing cou'd allure Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> to our Foreſt; he continu'd (as you told me long ſince he wou'd) an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate lover of the town, in ſpite of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and fair weather. Therefore hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, to all thoſe conſiderable qualities I know you poſſeſt of, I ſhall add that of Prophecy. But I ſtill believe Mr. <hi>Wycher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s intentions were good, and am ſatisfy'd that he promiſes nothing but with a real deſign to perform it: how much ſoever his other excellent qualities are above my imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, his ſincerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmoſt that I am,</p>

without ſuſpicion of their miſcarrying; not that they are of the leaſt value, but for fear ſomebody might be fooliſh enough to imagine them ſo, and inquiſitive enough to diſcover thoſe faults which I (by your help) wou'd correct.

And I deſire you to be the more ſevere, as it is much more criminal for me to make another ſpeak nonſenſe, than to do it in my own proper perſon. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire verſion of the firſt book.

The tranſlation goes on from thence to the words <hi>Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam,</hi> where there is an odd account of a battle at fifty-cuffs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Princes on a very ſlight occaſion, and at a time when one wou'd think the fatigue of their Journey in ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous a night, might have render'd them very unfit for ſuch a ſcuffle. This I had actually tranſlated, but was very ill ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conſcience; it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words—<hi>Hic primum luſtrare oculis,</hi> &amp;c.—to the end of the book.</p>
               <p>You will find, I doubt not, that <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was none of the diſcreeteſt Poets, tho' he was the beſt verſifier next <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil:</hi> In the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry, (which <hi>Horace</hi> had already taught the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>) when he asks his Muſe, where to begin his <hi>Thebaid,</hi> and ſeems to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould not be <hi>ab ovo Ledaeo?</hi> When he comes to the ſcene of his Poem, and the prize in diſpute between the Brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of it—

One of your objections, namely on that paſſage,
<q>
                     <l>The reſt, revolving years ſhall ripen into Fate,</l>
                  </q>
may be well grounded, in relation to its not being the exact ſenſe of the words—<note n="*" place="bottom">See the firſt book of <hi>Statius,</hi> Verſe 302.</note>
                  <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera reliquo ordine ducam.</hi> But the duration of the Action of <hi>Statius</hi>'s poem may as well be excepted againſt, as many things beſides in him: (which I wonder <hi>Boſſu</hi> has not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) For inſtead of confining his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>one year,</hi> it is manifeſtly exceeded in the very firſt two books: The Narration begins with <hi>Oedipus</hi>'s prayer to the <hi>Fury</hi> to promote diſcord betwixt his Sons; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Poet expreſly deſcribes their entrlng into the agreement of reigning a year by turns; and <hi>Polynices</hi> takes his flight for <hi>Thebes</hi> on his brother's refuſal to reſign the throne.

But <hi>Boſſu</hi> himſelf is miſtaken in one particular, relating to the commencement of the Action; ſaying in Book 2. Cap. 8. that <hi>Statius</hi> opens it with <hi>Europa</hi>'s <hi>Rape,</hi> whereas the Poet at moſt only deliberates whether he ſhou'd or not:
<q>
                     <l>—Unde jubetis</l>
                     <l>Ire, Deae? Gentiſne canam primordia, dirae,</l>

                     </l>
                  </q>
but then expreſly paſſes all this with a <hi>Longa retro ſeries</hi>—and ſays,

               <p>THE Morning after I parted from you, I found myſelf (as I had prophecy'd) all alone in an uneaſy Stage-Coach; a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the leaſt hope of entertainment but from my laſt recourſe in ſuch caſes, a Book. I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter into acquaintance with the <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> and had juſt receiv'd from them
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0096900700:397"/>
ſome cold conſolation for the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this life, and the incertainty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs; when I perceiv'd my Vehicle to ſtop, and heard from the ſide of it the dreadful news of a ſick Woman preparing to enter it. 'Tis not eaſy to gueſs at my mortification, but being ſo well fortify'd with Philoſophy I ſtood reſign'd with a Stoical conſtancy to endure the worſt of evils, a ſick Woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dreſs, that ſhe was Young and a Gentlewoman; but no ſooner was her hood remov'd, but I ſaw one of the fineſt faces I ever beheld, and to increaſe my ſurprize, heard her ſalute me by my name. I never had more reaſon to accuſe Nature for making me ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever ſeen thoſe fair eyes which knew me ſo well, and was utterly at a loſs how to addreſs myſelf; till with a great deal of ſimplicity and innocence ſhe let me know (even before I diſcover'd my ignorance) that ſhe was the daughter of one in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, lately marry'd, who having been conſulting her Phyſicians in Town, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into the Country, to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her. My Father, you muſt know, has ſometimes recommended the Study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to me, but I never had any ambition
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0096900700:398"/>
to be a Doctor till this inſtant. I ventur'd to preſcribe ſome Fruit (which I happen'd to have in the Coach) which being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den her by her Doctors, ſhe had the more inclination to. In ſhort, I tempted, and ſhe eat; nor was I more like the Devil than ſhe like <hi>Eve.</hi> Having the good ſucceſs of the 'foreſaid Gentleman before my eyes, I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and in ſpite of my evil Form accoſted her with all the Gaiety I was maſter of; which had ſo good effect, that in leſs than an hour ſhe grew pleaſant, her colour return'd, and ſhe was pleas'd to ſay my preſcription had wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I had the pleaſanteſt journey imaginable.</p>
               <p>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the air of a Romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as the greateſt of truths, That I think myſelf extremely oblig'd by you in all points, eſpecially for your kind and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Information and Advice in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the utmoſt concern to me, which I ſhall ever acknowledge as the higheſt proof at once of your friendſhip, juſtice, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. At the ſame time be aſſur'd, that Gentleman we ſpoke of, ſhall never by any alteration in me diſcover my knowledge of his Miſtake: the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of Return I can poſſibly
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0096900700:399"/>
make him for ſo many favours. And I may derive this pleaſure at leaſt from it, that whereas I muſt otherwiſe have been a little uneaſy to know my incapacity of returning to his Obligations; I may now, by bearing his Frailty, exerciſe my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Friendſhip more than Himſelf either is, or perhaps ever will be ſenſible of.<q>

               <p>But in one thing, I muſt confeſs you have yourſelf oblig'd me more than any man, which is, that you have ſhew'd me many of my Faults, to which as you are the more an implacable Enemy, by ſo much the more you are a kind Friend to me. I cou'd be proud, in revenge, to find a few ſlips in your Verſes, which I read in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſince in the Country with more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and pleaſure: the thoughts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt, and you are ſure not to let them ſuffer by the Verſification. If you wou'd oblige me with the truſt of any thing of yours, I ſhou'd be glad to execute any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions you wou'd give me concerning them. I am here ſo perfectly at leiſure, that nothing wou'd be ſo agreeable an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment

               <p>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my Letters wou'd be as bad as a Rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your Good-nature, the other wou'd be too much for your Quiet, which is one bleſſing Good-nature ſhou'd indiſpenſably receive from mankind, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for thoſe many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in ſpeaking well of me in my abſence; the only thing by which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0096900700:402"/>
you prove yourſelf no Wit or Critic: Tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will ſhow juſt as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am abſent, as he does ſeverity to 'em when I am preſent. To be very frank with you, Sir, I muſt own, that where I receiv'd ſo much Civility at firſt, I cou'd hardly have expected ſo much Sincerity afterwards. But now I have only to wiſh, that the laſt were but equal to the firſt, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, ſo you wou'd omit nothing to improve me.</p>
               <p>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your ſpeculative Angle in the Widow's Coffee-houſe, and bidding adieu for ſome time to all the <hi>Rehearſals, Reviews, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes,</hi> &amp;c. have march'd off into <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire.</hi> Thus I find you vary your life in the ſcene at leaſt, tho' not in the Action; for tho' life for the moſt part, like an old Play, be ſtill the ſame, yet no w and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining. As for myſelf, I would not have my life a very regular Play, let it be a good mery Farce, a G-d's name, and a fig for the critical Unities! Yet (on the other ſide) I wou'd as ſoon write like <hi>Durfey,</hi> as live like <hi>T<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>_…</desc>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0096900700:403"/>
merry life, is (if you will excuſe ſuch a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude) not unlike a F--t, at once naſty and laughable. For the generality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce, nor one, nor all of theſe: every Actor is much better known by his having the ſame Face, than by keeping the ſame Character: for we change our minds as often as they can their parts, and he who was yeſterday <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is to day Sir <hi>John Daw.</hi> So that one might ask the ſame queſtion of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern life, that <hi>Rich</hi> did of a modern play; <q>
                     <l>" Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me;</l>
                     <l>" Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perſuade myſelf it might be uſeful, at a time when we have no other Theatre, to divert ourſelves at this great one. Here is a glorious ſtanding Comedy of Fools, at which every man is heartily merry, and thinks himſelf an unconcern'd Spectator. This (to our ſingular comfort) neither my Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen herſelf can ever ſhut up, or ſilence. While that of <hi>Drury</hi> (alas!) lies deſolate, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt peace: and the melancholy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Nymphys yet lingring about its beloved avenues, appears no leſs moving than that of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Dames lamenting over their ruin'd <hi>Ilium!</hi> What now can they

hope, diſpoſieſs'd of their antient ſeats, but to ſerve as Captives to the inſulting Victors of the <hi>Hay-market?</hi> The afflicted ſubjects of <hi>France</hi> do not, in our <hi>Poſt-man,</hi> ſo gnie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly deplore the obſtinacy of their arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Monarch, as theſe periſhing people of <hi>Drury</hi> the obdurate heart of that <hi>Pharaoh, Rich,</hi> who like him, diſdains all Propoſals of peace and accommodation. Several Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels have been ſecretly affix'd to the great gates of his imperial palace in <hi>Bridges-ſtreet;</hi> and a Memorial repreſenting the diſtreſſes of theſe perſons, has been accidentally dropt (as we are credibly inform'd by a perſon of quality) out of his firſt Miniſter the chief Box-keeper's pocket, at a late Conference of the ſaid Perſon of quality and others, on the part of the Confederates, and his Theatrical Majeſty on his own part. Of this you may expect a copy as ſoon as it ſhall be tranſmitted to us from a good hand. As for the late Congreſs, it is here reported, that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of
ſo many wretched Ladies may induce this haughty Prince to reaſon.</p>

               <p>I MAY truly ſay I am more oblig'd to you this ſummer than to any of my Acquaintance, for had it not been for the two kind letters you ſent me, I had been perfectly, <hi>oblituſque meorum, obliviſcendus &amp; illis.</hi> The only companions I had were thoſe Muſes of whom <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, <hi>Adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentiam alunt, Senectutem oblectant, ſecundas res ornant, adverſis perfugium ac ſolatium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiſcum, peregrinantur, ruſtican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them; for the Muſes, if you take them as Companions, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant and agreeable; but whoever ſhould be forc'd to live or depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em, would find himſelf in a very bad condition. That Quiet, which <hi>Cowley</hi> calls the <hi>Companion of Obſcurity,</hi> was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, unleſs it was interrupted by thoſe fears you ſo juſtly gueſs I had for our Friend's welfare. 'Tis extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinc'd by his long
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0096900700:406"/>
ſilence. However the love of ſome things rewards itſelf, as of Virtue, and of Mr. <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherley.</hi> I am ſurpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in, and muſt agree with you, that our nation would have loſt in him alone, more wit and probity, than would have remain'd (for ought I know) in all the reſt of it. My concern for his friendſhip will excuſe me, (ſince I know you honour him ſo much, and ſince you know I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my uneaſineſs to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one to inſinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> which I fear may have had ſome effect upon him. If ſo, he will have a greater puniſhment for his credulity than I cou'd wiſh him, in that fellow's acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The loſs of a faithful creature is ſomething, tho' of ever ſo contemptible an one; and if I were to change my Dog for ſuch a Man as the aforeſaid, I ſhou'd think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows me about as conſtantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> in the Town.)</p>
               <p>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a worſe ſubject which my ſpleen tempts me to, I will give you ſome account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, ſince <hi>Montaigne</hi> (to whom I am but a Dog
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0096900700:407"/>
in compariſon) has done the very ſame thing of his Cat. <hi>Dic mihi quid melius deſidioſus agam?</hi> You are to know then, that as 'tis Likeneſs begets affection, ſo my favourite dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of the fineſt ſhap'd. He is not much a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him) a dumb ſurly ſort of kindneſs, that rather ſhows itſelf when he thinks me ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by ourſelves. If it be the chief point of Friendſhip to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I ſit, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witneſs our walk a year ago in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park.</hi>—Hiſtories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends, but I will not inſiſt upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of 'em, becauſe it is poſſible ſome may be almoſt as fabulous as thoſe of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> &amp;c. I will only ſay for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Dogs, that the two moſt antient and eſteemable books ſacred and prophane extant, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi>) have ſhewn a particular regard to theſe animals. That of <hi>Toby</hi> is the more remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no manner of reaſon to take notice of the Dog, beſides the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0096900700:408"/>
of the Author. <hi>Homer</hi>'s account of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>'s Dog <hi>Argus</hi> is the moſt pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick imaginable, all the Circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, and an excellent proof of the old Bard's Good-nature. <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> had left him at <hi>Ithaca</hi> when he embark'd for <hi>Troy,</hi> and found him at his return after twenty years, (which by the way is not unnatural as ſome Critics have ſaid, ſince I remember the dam of my dog was twenty-two years old when ſhe dy'd: May the omen of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaevity prove fortunate to her ſucceſſor!)

               <p>I Had written to you ſooner, but that I made ſome ſcruple of ſending prophane things to you in Holy week. Beſides our Family wou'd have been ſcandaliz'd to ſee me write, who take it for granted I write nothing but ungodly Verſes. I aſſure you I

am look'd upon in the Neighbourhood for a very well-diſpos'd perſon, no great Hunter indeed, but a great Admirer of the noble ſport, and only unhappy in my want of conſtitution for that, and Drinking. They all ſay 'tis pity I am ſo ſickly, and I think 'tis pity they are ſo healthy. But I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may deſtroy their good opinion of me: I have not quoted one <hi>Latin</hi> Author ſince I came down, but have learn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book a Song of Mr. <hi>Thomas Durfey</hi>'s, who is your only Poet of tolerable reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this country.

               <p>I Had not ſo long omitted to expreſs my acknowledgments to you for ſo much good-nature and friendſhip as you lately ſhow'd me; but that I am but juſt return'd to my own Hermitage, from Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi>'s,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0096900700:413"/>
who has done me ſo many favours, that I am almoſt inclin'd to think my Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one another, and that your converſation with him has made him as obliging to me as yourſelf. I can aſſure you he has a ſincere reſpect for you, and this I believe he has partly contracted from me, who am too full of you not to overflow upon thoſe I converſe with. But I muſt now be contented to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe only with the Dead of this world, that is to ſay, the dull and obſcure, every way obſcure, in their intellects as well as their perſons: Or elſe have recourſe to the living Dead, the old Authors with whom you are ſo well acquainted, even from <hi>Virgil</hi> down to <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> whom I do not think a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic by any means to be compar'd to Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> And I muſt declare poſitively to you, that I will perſiſt in this opinion, till you become a little more civil to <hi>Atticus.</hi> Who cou'd have imagin'd, that he who had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all the misfortunes of his Time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt even by the Proſcriptions of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> ſhou'd in theſe days find an Enemy more ſevere and barbarous than thoſe Tyrants? and that Enemy the gentleſt too, the beſt-natur'd of mortals, Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0096900700:414"/>
I leave you to reflect on this, and hope that time (which mollifies rocks, and of ſtiff things makes limber) will turn a reſolute critic to a gentle reader; and inſtead of this poſitive, tremendous, new-faſhion'd Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>AFTER I had recover'd from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Illneſs which was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in Town, about a fortnight after my coming hither I troubled you with a letter, and a paper inclos'd, which you had been ſo obliging as to deſire a ſight of when laſt I ſaw you, promiſing me in return ſome tranſlations of yours from <hi>Ovid.</hi> Since when, I have not had a ſyllable from your hands, ſo that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Death, I have not Oblivion. I ſhou'd at leaſt have expected you to have finiſh'd that Elegy upon me, which you told me you was upon the point of beginning when I was ſick in <hi>London;</hi> if you will but do ſo much for me firſt, I will give you leave to forget me afterwards; and for my own part will die at diſcretion, and at my leiſure. But I fear I muſt be forc'd like many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authors, to write my own Epitaph, if I wou'd be remember'd at all. <hi>Monſieur de la Fontaine</hi>'s wou'd fit me to a hair, but it is a kind of Sacrilege, (do you think it is not?) to ſteal Epitaphs. In my preſent, living dead condition, nothing wou'd be properer than <hi>Oblituſque meorum, obliviſcendus &amp; illis,</hi> but that unluckily I can't forget my friends, and the civilities I receiv'd from yourſelf,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0096900700:416"/>
and ſome others. They ſay indeed 'tis one quality of generous minds to forget the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations they have conſerr'd, and perhaps too it may be ſo to forget thoſe on whom they conferr'd 'em? Then indeed I muſt be forgotten to all intents and purpoſes! I am, it muſt be own'd, dead in a natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, according to Mr. <hi>Bickerſtaff;</hi> dead in a poetical capacity, as a damn'd author; and dead in a civil capacity, as a uſeleſs member of the Common-wealth. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, dear Sir, what melancholy effects may enſue, if Dead men are not civil to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If he who has nothing to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will not comfort and ſupport another in his Idleneſs? If thoſe who are to die themſelves, will not now and then pay the charity of viſiting a Tomb and a dead friend, and ſtrowing a ſew flow'rs over him? In the ſhades where I am, the Inhabitants have a mutual compaſſion for each other: Being all alike <hi>Inanes,</hi> and <hi>Umbratiles,</hi> we ſaunter to one another's habitations, and daily aſſiſt each other in doing nothing at all; this I mention for your edification and example, that <hi>Tout plein du vie</hi> as you are, yet you may not ſometimes diſdain—<hi>deſipere in loco.</hi> Tho' you are no Papiſt, and have not ſo much regard to the dead as to addreſs yourſelf to them, (which I plainly perceive by your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) yet I hope you are not one of thoſe

Heterodox, who hold them to be totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the good offices and kind wiſhes of their living friends, and to be in a dull State of Sleep, without one dream of thoſe they left behind them?

               <p>'TIS very natural for a young Friend, and a young Lover, to think the perſons they love have nothing to do but to pleaſe them; when perhaps they, for their parts, had twenty other engagements before.

This ſort of writing call'd the <hi>Rondeau</hi> is what I never knew practis'd in our Nation, and I verily believe it was not in uſe with the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> neither <hi>Macrobius</hi> nor <hi>Hyginus</hi> taking the leaſt notice of it.

               <p>AT laſt I have prevail'd over a lazy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to tranſcribe this Elegy: I have chang'd the ſituation of ſome of the <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes, and made ſome Interpola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but I hope they are not abſurd, and foreign to my author's ſenſe and manner; but they are refer'd to your cenſure, as a debt; whom I eſteem no leſs a Critic than a Poet: I expect to be treated with the ſame rigour as I have practis'd to Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> and you,

               <p>I Give you thanks for the Verſion you ſent me of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeableneſs that charms us without correctneſs, like a miſtreſs whoſe faults we ſee, but love her with them all. You have very judiciouſly alter'd his method in ſome places, and I can find nothing which I dare inſiſt upon as an error: What I have written in the margins being merely Gueſſes at a little improvement, rather than Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms. I aſſure you I do not expect you ſhou'd ſubſcribe to my private notions but when you ſhall judge 'em agreeable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and good ſenſe. What I have done is not as a Critic, but as a Friend; I know too well how many qualities are requiſite to make up the one, and that I want almoſt all
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0096900700:423"/>
I can reckon up; but I am ſure I do not want inclination, nor I hope capacity, to be the other. Nor ſhall I take it at all amiſs, that another diſſents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in underſtanding, he becomes the more eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day a critic upon himſelf, and finds ſomething or other ſtill to blame in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer notions and opinions. I cou'd be glad to know if you have tranſlated the 11th Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ad amican navigantem,</hi> the 8th of Book 3, or the 11th of Book 3, which are above all others my particular favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, eſpecially the laſt of theſe.</p>
               <p>As to the paſſage of which you ask my opinion in the ſecond <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it is either ſo plain as to require no ſolution; or elſe (which is very probable) you ſee farther into it than I can. <hi>Priam</hi> wou'd ſay, <q rend="inline">"that <hi>Achilles</hi> (whom ſurely you only feign to be your Father, ſince your actions are ſo different from his) did not uſe me thus inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He bluſh'd at his murder of <hi>Hector</hi> when he ſaw my ſorrows for him; and reſtor'd his dead body to me to be buried."</q> To this the anſwer of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſeems to be agreeable enough. <q rend="inline">"Go then to the ſhades, and tell <hi>Achilles</hi> how I degenerate from him:"</q> granting the truth of what <hi>Priam</hi> had ſaid of the difference between them.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0096900700:424"/>
Indeed Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s mentioning here what <hi>Virgil</hi> more judiciouſly paſſes in ſilence, the circumſtance of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s ſelling <hi>for mony</hi> the body of <hi>Hector,</hi> ſeems not ſo proper; it in ſome meaſure leſs'ning the character of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s generoſity and piety, which is the very point of which <hi>Priam</hi> endeavours in this place to convince his Son, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with the want of. But the truth of this Circumſtance is no way to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd being expreſly taken from <hi>Homer,</hi> who repreſents <hi>Achilles</hi> weeping for <hi>Priam,</hi> yet receiving the gold, <hi>Iliad</hi> 24: For when he gives the body, he uſes theſe words, <q rend="inline">"O my friend <hi>Patroclus!</hi> forgive me that I quit the corps of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ranſom for it, which I will beſtow upon thy funeral."</q>

               <p>YOUR Letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement, utterly forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all his Friends but you; for ſince Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> left <hi>London,</hi> I have not heard a word from him; tho' juſt before, and once ſince, I writ to him, and tho' I know my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf guilty of no offence but of doing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely juſt what he <note n="*" place="bottom">Correcting his Verſes.

In what I ſent you ſome time ago, you have not verſe enough to be ſevere upon, in revenge for my laſt criticiſm: In one point I muſt perſiſt, that is to ſay, my diſlike of your <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0096900700:427"/>
in which I take no pleaſure; I know very well that in <hi>Greek</hi> 'tis not only us'd by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> but is a common word for any Garden; but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> it bears the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and conveys the idea of <hi>Eden,</hi> which alone is (I think) a reaſon againſt making <hi>Ovid</hi> uſe it; who will be thought to talk too like a Chriſtian in your verſion at leaſt, whatever it might have been in <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek.</hi> As for all the reſt of my Remarks, ſince you do not laugh at them as at this, I can be ſo civil as not to lay any ſtreſs upon 'em (as I think I told you before) and in particular in the point of <hi>Trees enjoying,</hi> you have, I muſt own, ſully ſatisfy'd me that the Expreſſion is not only defenſible, but beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I ſhall be very glad to ſee your Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elegy, <hi>Ad Amicam navigantem,</hi> as ſoon as you can; for (without a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you) every thing you write either in verſe or proſe, is welcome to me; and you may be confident, (if my opinion can be of any ſort of conſequence in any thing) that I will never be unſincere, tho' I may be often miſtaken. To uſe Sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin, from whom I have experienc'd ſo much of it; and I need not tell you how much I really eſteem you, when I eſteem nothing in the world ſo much as that Quality. I know you ſometimes ſay civil things to me in your Epiſtolary Style, but thoſe I am to make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0096900700:428"/>
for, as particularly when you talk of <hi>Admiring;</hi> 'tis a word you are ſo us'd to in converſation of Ladies, that it will creep in to your diſcourſe in ſpite of you, ev'n to your Friends. But as Women when they think themſelves ſecure of admiration, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a thouſand Negligences, which ſhow them ſo much at diſadvantage and off their guard, as to loſe the little real Love they had before: ſo when men imagine others entertain ſome eſteem for their abilities, they often expoſe all their Imperfections and fooliſh works, to the diſparagement of the little Wit they were thought maſters of. I am going to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify this to you, in putting into your hands (being encourag'd by ſo much indulgence) ſome verſes of my Youth, or rather Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; which (as I was a great admirer of <hi>Waller</hi>) were intended in imitation of his manner; and are perhaps, ſuch imitations, as thoſe you ſee in awkward country Dames of the fine and well-bred Ladies of the Court. If you will take 'em with you into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> they may ſave you one hour from the converſation of the country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and their Tenants, (who differ but in Dreſs and Name) which if it be there as bad as here, is even worſe than my Poetry.

He will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to compound for his Quiet only, and leave all the circumſtantial part and pomp of life to thoſe, who have a health vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enough to enjoy all the Miſtreſſes of their deſires.

               <p>I was mightily pleas'd to perceive by your quotation from <hi>Voiture,</hi> that you had track'd me ſo far as <hi>France.</hi> You ſee 'tis with weak heads as with weak ſtomachs, they immediately throw out what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd laſt: and what they read, floats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurface of their mind, like Oil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on water, without incorporating. This, I think however, can't be ſaid of the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes I laſt troubled you with, where all (I am afraid) is ſo puerile and ſo like the Author, that no body will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect any thing to be borrow'd. Yet you, (as a friend, entertaining a better opinion of 'em) it ſeems ſearch'd in <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> but ſearch'd in vain.

Theſe are more after <hi>Virgil</hi>'s manner than that of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> whom yet in the character of Paſtoral he rather ſeems to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0096900700:434"/>
imitate. In the whole, I agree with the <hi>Tatler,</hi> that we have no better Eclogues in our language. There is a ſmall copy of the ſame Author publiſh'd in the <hi>Tatler</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 12. on the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I recommend it to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Garth</hi>'s Poem I have not ſeen, but believe I ſhall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at <hi>Will</hi>'s, who ſwore it was good: For tho' I am very cautious of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Critics, yet I think one may do it more ſafely when they commend, than when they blame.</p>
               <p>I agree with you in your cenſure of the uſe of <hi>Sea-terms</hi> in Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Virgil;</hi> not only becauſe <hi>Helenus</hi> was no great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in thoſe matters, but becauſe no Terms of Art or Cant-Words ſuit with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and dignity of Style which <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry requires.—<hi>Cui mens divinior atque os magna ſoniturum.</hi>—The Tarpawlin Phraſe can pleaſe none but ſuch <hi>Qui aurem habent Batavam;</hi> they muſt not expect <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Atticis probari,</hi> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phraſes of <hi>Martial</hi> here very dexterouſly.)</p>
               <p>Tho' you ſay you did not rightly take my Meaning in the verſe I quoted from <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> yet I will not explain it; becauſe tho' it ſeems you are reſolv'd to take me for a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0096900700:435"/>
Critic, I wou'd by no means be thought a Commentator.—And for another reaſon too, becauſe I have quite forgot both the Verſe and the Application.</p>
               <p>I hope it will be no offence to give my moſt hearty ſervice to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> tho' I perceive by his laſt to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, ſince he there told me he was going inſtantly out of Town, and till his return was my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I gueſs by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him I have ever borne all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Kindneſs imaginable to him. I do not know to this hour what it is that has eſtrang'd him from me; but this I know, that he may for the future be more ſafely my friend, ſince no invitation of his ſhall ever more make me ſo free with him. I cou'd not have thought any man had been ſo very cautious and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as not to credit his own Experience of a friend. Indeed to believe no body, may be a Maxim of Safety, but not ſo much of Honeſty. There is but one way I know of converſing ſafely with all men, that is, not by concealing what we ſay or do, but by ſaying or doing nothing that deſerves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, and I can truly boaſt this comfort in my affairs with Mr. <hi>Wycherley.</hi> But I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

his Jealouſy, which is become his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſhall never be his enemy whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſays of me.</p>

               <p>IT ſeems that my late mention of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curioſity. I therefore ſend you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for ſome years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of thoſe whoſe works may juſt deſerve reading. I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman, that is, at leiſure hours, and more to keep out of idleneſs, than to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a reputation: ſo that nothing regular or juſt can be expected from him. All that regards Deſign, Form, Fable, (which is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, or conſent of parts, (which is the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0096900700:447"/>
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring expreſſions, and ſomething of a neat caſt of Verſe, (which are properly the dreſs, gems, or looſe ornaments of Poetry) may be found in theſe verſes. This is indeed the caſe of moſt other Poetical Writers of <hi>Miſcellanies;</hi> nor can it well be otherwiſe, ſince no man can be a true Poet, who writes for diverſion only. Theſe Authors ſhou'd be conſider'd as <hi>Verſifiers</hi> and <hi>witty Men,</hi> rather than as <hi>Poets;</hi> and under this head will only fall the Thoughts, the Expreſſion, and the Numbers. Theſe are only the pleaſing parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to expreſs myſelf like a Painter) their <hi>Colouring</hi> entertains the ſight, but the <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the Picture are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected too narrowly.</p>
               <p>This Author form'd himſelf upon <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,</hi> or rather upon <hi>Marino.</hi> His thoughts one may obſerve, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often ſtrain'd and ſtiffned to make them appear the greater. For men are never ſo apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and inconſiderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than underſtood. This ambition of ſurpriſing a reader, is the true natural cauſe of all Fuſtian, or Bombaſt in
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0096900700:448"/>
Poetry. To confirm what I have ſaid you need but look into his firſt Poem of the <hi>Weeper,</hi> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21ſt ſtanza's are as ſublimely dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d ſtanza's of the ſame copy, are ſoft and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: And if theſe laſt want any thing, it is an eaſier and more unaffected expreſſion. The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been ſpared, being eihter but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example in the firſt one may gueſs at all the reſt, to be like this; a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and ſutiable expreſſions, of ſorc'd and inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable conceits, and of needleſs fillers-up to the reſt. From all which it is plain, this Author writ faſt, and ſet down what came uppermoſt. A reader may skim off the froth, and uſe the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of him are good for little, but what he did in his <hi>own, natural, middle-way,</hi> is beſt.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak of his <hi>Numbers</hi> is a little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, they are ſo various and irregular, and moſtly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic Verſe (the beſt example of which is his <hi>Muſick</hi>'s <hi>Duel</hi>) is careleſly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0096900700:449"/>
that had he taken more care, it had been muſical and pleaſing enough, not extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly majeſtic, but ſweet: And the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd of his writing, he was (ev'n as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct as he is) none of the worſt Verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators.</p>
               <p>I will juſt obſerve, that the beſt Pieces of this Author are, a Paraphraſe on Pſal. 23. On <hi>Leſſius,</hi> Epitaph on Mr. <hi>Aſhton,</hi> Wiſhes to his ſuppos'd Miſtreſs, and the <hi>Dies Irae.</hi>

               <p>I Reſume my old liberty of throwing out myſelf upon paper to you, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what thoughts float uppermoſt in my head, the ſubject of a letter. They are at preſent upon <hi>Laughter,</hi> which (for ought I know) may be the cauſe you might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times think me too remiſs a friend, when I was moſt intirely ſo: for I am never ſo inclin'd to mirth as when I am moſt pleas'd and moſt eaſy, which is in the company of a friend like yourſelf.</p>

As the fooling and toying with a miſtreſs is a proof of fondneſs, not diſreſpect, ſo is raillery with a friend. I know there are Prudes in friendſhip, who expect diſtance, awe and adoration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhipper, tho' a Papiſt. If I were to addreſs <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf in a heathen way, I fancy I ſhou'd be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> I was juſt going to ſay of his buttons, but I think <hi>Jupiter</hi> wore none (however I won't be poſitive to ſo nice a Critic as you, but his robe might be <hi>Subnected</hi> with a <hi>Fibula.</hi>) I know ſome Philoſophers define Laughter, <hi>A recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves to our own favour, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the weakneſs of another:</hi> but I am ſure I very rarely laugh with that view, nor do I believe <hi>Children</hi> have any ſuch conſideration in their heads, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their pleaſure this way: I laugh full as innocently as they, for the moſt part, and as ſillily. There is a difference too betwixt laughing <hi>about</hi> a thing and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>at</hi> a thing: One may find the inferior Man (to make a kind of caſuiſtical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction) provok'd to folly at the ſight or obſervation of ſome <hi>circumſtance of a thing,</hi> when the <hi>thing itſelf</hi> appears ſolemn and auguſt to the ſuperior Man, that is, our
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0096900700:451"/>
Judgment and Reaſon. Let an Ambaſſador ſpeak the beſt Senſe in the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf in the moſt graceful manner before a Prince, yet if the <hi>Tail</hi> of <hi>his Shirt</hi> happen (as I have known it happen to a very wiſe man) to hang out behind, more people ſhall laugh at that than attend to the other; till they recollect themſelves, and then they will not have a jot the leſs reſpect for the Miniſter. I muſt confeſs the iniquity of my countenance before you; ſeveral Muſcles of my Face ſometimes take an impertinent liberty with my Judgment, but then my Judgment ſoon riſes, and ſets all right again about my mouth: And I find I value no man ſo much, as he in whoſe ſight I have been playing the fool. I cannot be <hi>Sub-Perſona</hi> before a man I love; and not to laugh with honeſty, when Nature prompts, or Folly (which is more a ſecond Nature than any thing I know) is but a knaviſh hypocritical way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a mask of one's own Face.—To conclude, thoſe that are my friends I <hi>laugh with,</hi> and thoſe that are not I <hi>laugh at;</hi> ſo am merry in company, and if ever I am wiſe, it is all by myſelf.

Oh happy Favourite of the Muſes! how <hi>per-noctare,</hi> all night long with them? but alas! you do but toy, but ſkirmiſh with them, and decline a cloſe Engagement. Leave Elegy and Tranſlation to the inferior Claſs, on whom the Muſes only glance now and then like our Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Sun, and then leave 'em in the dark. Think on the Dignity of Tragedy, which is of the greater Poetry, as <hi>Dennis</hi> ſays, and foil him at his other weapon, as you have done in Criticiſm. Every one wonders that a Genius like yours will not ſupport the ſinking <hi>Drama;</hi> and Mr <hi>Wilks</hi> (tho' I think his Talent is Comedy) has expreſs'd a furious ambition to ſwell in your Buſkins. We have had a poor Comedy of <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s (not <hi>Ben</hi>) which held ſeven nights, and has got him three hundred pounds, for the Town is ſharp-ſet on new Plays. In vain wou'd I fire you by Intereſt or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when your mind is not ſuſceptible of either; tho' your Authority (ariſing from the General eſteem, like that of <hi>Pompey</hi>) muſt infallibly aſſure you of ſucceſs; for

               <p>IF I have not writ to you ſo ſoon as I ought, let my writing now attone for the delay; as it will infallibly do, when you know what a Sacrifice I make you at this time, and that every moment my eyes are employ'd upon this paper, they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from two of the fineſt Faces in the univerſe. But indeed 'tis ſome conſolation to me to reflect, that while I but write this period. I eſcape ſome hundred fatal Darts from thoſe unerring Eyes, and about a thouſand Deaths, or better.

Now you that are a Critic, pray inform me, in what manner I may connect the foregoing part of this Letter with that which is to follow, according to the Rules? I would willingly return Mr <hi>Gay</hi> my thanks for the favour of his Poem, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular for his kind mention of me; I hop'd, when I heard a new Comedy had met with ſucceſs upon the Stage, that it had been his, to which I really wiſh no leſs; and (had it been any way in my power) ſhould have been very glad to have contributed to it's Introduction into the world.
