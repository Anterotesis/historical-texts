            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0209501600:3"/>better to be potent in Fact than only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear puiſſant in Words, (as do the Generality of our modern Doctors) and to relieve Perſons under exquiſite Pain, than to divert our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with Concluſions drawn from Topicks grounded on fundamental Truths or eſſential Verities: Expect not therefore to meet with many profound Philoſophical Hypotheſis's, or that I ſhould prove the abſtruce Principles, or real Grounds of Sympathy, or concupiſcible At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Coition; nor with Mathematical Demonſtrations, which I mention laſt, becauſe I think the leaſt neceſſary in Phyſick.</p>
            <p>It is enough, (at leaſt for a time) that we have made known (for univerſal Good) ſuch a <hi>Polichreſtick,</hi> or Sovereign Medicine, as one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Conſimilar to it can't be produced by any Doctor, Chymiſt, or Apothecary in <hi>Great Britain:</hi> Yea, and ſuch a one as will extirpate thoſe Hydra's of Diſeaſes undermentioned, which have for ſo many Ages bid Defiance to the moſt eminent and ſage Phyſicians. Let not this ſeem a bold and emperical Aſſertion, but ſuſpend your Verdict till you have peruſed the following Account; which before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give, it will be requiſite to tell you, that the Author has uſed them with admirable yea almoſt incredible Succeſs, above theſe Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Three Years, not only in this Metropolis, but in moſt Parts of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and tho' he ſeldom adminiſtred them to any but ſuch as were (by the ableſt Phyſicians) pronounced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and had languiſhed under their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, ſome Three, ſome Seven, ſome Ten and ſome Twenty Years, yet there were none,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0209501600:4"/>tho' their Caſes were never ſo complicated, or of never ſo long Continuance, but were in the Space of one Month (at moſt) reſtored (by the help of theſe Pills) to a perfect State of Health. And tho' I could nominate above a hundred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and almoſt incredible Cures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, (to many of which ſome of our eminent Doctors now in being are no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) yet I decline it, and refer the Matter to Experience, which is the only true Examen or <hi>Lydian</hi> Touch-ſtone, to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſity, and matter of Fact from ſpurious and odible Impoſture.</p>

            <p n="10">10thly. Heat and Hardneſs of the Liver, which uſually cauſes the Jaundies, both yellow and black, and a ſchirrhus or ſtony Hardneſs of the Liver, generally thought incurable; and indeed if the Patient hath been a hard Drinker and in Years; if likewiſe the Diſtemper has been of long Continuance, it may be concluded ſo; but if none of theſe Three Circumſtances occur, theſe Pills have been found experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to reſtore the Liver to its proper Function. They alſo perfectly cure the black and yellow Jaundies.</p>
            <p n="11">11thly.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0209501600:7"/>under any Form or Symptom whatever, in any Part of the Body.

Provided alſo that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be of a Plethoric, or full habit of Body, not Thin, Meagre, or Lean, Old, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated; or that the Palſy hath not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervened ſome preceding Diſtemper, as a Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then theſe Pills will certainly reſtore the Members to their Priſtine Strength, and the Patient to perfect Health.</p>
            <p n="15">15thly, All hardneſs with Extenſion or ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Peritonaeum, and Belly, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Navel, but between that and the Pit of the Stomach, accompany'd with pain and difficulty of bending the Body downwards: Which in Men, hath by many Doctors been taken for a Dropſy, (as they do a Tympany of the Womb) and handled with the like Succeſs.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0209501600:8"/>Several other Caſes I could mention, ſurpaſſing belief, attended with ſuch Symptoms as the Doctors could neither tell what to call, nor how to manage; which perhaps we may take occaſion to inſert in the next Edition of theſe Directions. This only will I add, as a general Rule, that in all Cronic and Complicated Caſes, if the Party hath ſtore of Fluids, theſe Pills are never given without the deſired Succeſs.</p>
            <p>I have by by this time ('tis ſuppos'd) a little ſtartled you, by citing ſuch a Scroll or Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of direful Diſeaſes, and the Gout it ſelf, which for many Ages hath withſtood the force of all Medicines that could be oppoſed, by the moſt learned Academicks; I ſay, no doubt but you'll wonder, that they ſhould be eradicated by a Doſe or Two, of one only Medicine; but we boldly and openly bid defiance to all the <hi>Aeſculapian</hi> Tribe in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Medicine operating like this, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Account of which will probably put the matter out of all Diſpute, and to your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Satisfaction.</p>

               <head>Their manner of Operation, and the Method of ordering the Patient.</head>
               <p>A Convenient Room with a Fire in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided, and Two Perſons to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, let the Patient go into a warmed Bed, at Eight a Clock in the Evening (or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time in caſe of Neceſſity) put at the ſame time a blade or two of Mace and an upper Cruſt of Bread, into a Pint of Ale, and cover it up cloſe: Which done, give him the Pills in the Pulp of a roaſted Apple, (which is the beſt) or a Wafer moiſtened with Water or Canary, drinking nothing either with, or after them; then compoſing himſelf, he will preſently be a Sleep, and continue ſo Four Hours, and no longer; during which time he will ſweat moſt powerfully, and care muſt be had neither to wipe the Sweat off his Face, nor do any thing elſe to diſturb him. The Four Hours being expired, and the Patient awake, let two Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rub him dry with hot Cloaths, and put on him a clean hot Shirt and Gown; then bring him to the Fire, and let him eat a Morſel of the Bread, and ſip ſome of the Mace Ale made very hot, and well ſweetned with ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Loaf-Sugar; when he hath done this, and drank the remaining part of the Ale, Sweating will immediately ceaſe, which is <hi>è diametro,</hi> or directly contrary to all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics or Sweating Medicines now in uſe.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0209501600:10"/>Preſently after they work plentifully by Urine, (which when cold, in ſome Caſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions may be cut with a Knife as Size.) To ſee the Contents of which, a clean White-Ware Chamber-Pot muſt be in a readineſs, for they cleanſe the Kidnies and Ureters of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Stones, Sand, Slime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if any be lodged there: When he has been up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a quarter and half an Hour, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Bed again, it being turned and well warmed, or another well ſeaſoned put in its place, the Sheets and Blankets likewiſe being changed, and others well heated put on; then the Pills begin to work ſtrongly, by breaking Wind downwards, to his own and the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders great ſurprize.</p>
               <p>The Patient muſt neither eat nor drink any thing till Dinner, if he can faſt ſo long; if he can't, a Morſel of Bread, and a quarter of a Pint of hot Ale, ſweetened with ſingle refined Loaf-Sugar may be taken. Let his Dinner be hot, but neither of baked, fryed, nor frigofy'd Meat, his drink alſo muſt be hot, and I forbid Wines of all ſort, during the whole courſe of theſe Operations, and 24 Hours after they all ceaſe, and it would be better if neceſſity would permit to forbear Wine for 24 Hours before the Pills are taken.</p>
               <p>About two Hours after Dinner they begin to work downwards by Stool, except the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has Obſtructions in the Liver, Kidneys, Lacteals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or a Tympany of the Womb, or that Diſtemper which the Doctors call a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the <hi>Ovarium;</hi> in all which caſes, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0209501600:11"/>ſome others, the working by Stool is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by one large but eaſy Vomit; without any previous Nauſea, or Sickneſs which brings up none of the Meat with it. During the time they Purge, which is without any Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Gripes, the Patient muſt by no means ſtop a Motion, or expoſe himſelf to any cold or damp Air, or place; neither (except in Caſes of extream Thirſt, which I never knew to happen) muſt he drink any thing; but if Thirſtineſs urge, a little Tea, made of good Juniper-berries, and ſweetned with ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Loaf-Sugar, may be drank.</p>
               <p>About an Hour and half, or two Hours at moſt, after Supper (which muſt be hot,) the Patient muſt go to a well warmed Bed; and the Pills taken the Night before, will repeat their Operations ſucceſſively as at firſt, but in a much weaker degree: So that ſometimes there is no occaſion either to rub the Party or change his Linnen. In ſome Caſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, the firſt Doſe will work 2 or 3 Nights and Days, and the ſecond Doſe 3 or 4, eſpecially in hot Weather, or Summer Time; and then there muſt be an Intermiſſion of 2 or 3 Days before the Third Doſe be taken; but two Doſes commonly perform the Cure, be the Caſe never ſo Chronic and Complicated: In all my 33 Years Practice and upward, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew but one Patient that had Occaſion for the Third Doſe; whoſe Caſe and many others very wonderful, ſhall in another Eſſay be fully related.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0209501600:12"/>
               <p>Indeed their manner of Operation is ſo particular and extraordinary, that I almoſt think it hath ſcarce been parallell'd in any Age; for tho' they work moſt powerfully by all the Emunctories, yet they are ſo gentle and agreeable to Nature, that ſhe is not only exceedingly refreſh'd by them afterwards; but even pleaſs'd with the ſeeming Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance they give her. Hence 'tis no wonder that theſe <hi>Pilulae Polychreſtae,</hi> ſhould extirpate ſo many dreadful Diſeaſes in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
