            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:0114800200:5"/>on God in all their Dangers, nay at all times, for that is the beſt and ſureſt Anchor hold and Security that recourſe to can be had, and therefore I have furniſhed this Book with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wonderful and Remarkable <hi>Sea-Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> to ſhow them that their Hopes are not in vain; for the Wonders he has already wrought, he will doubtleſs continue to all that fear and put their Truſt in him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Collection</hi> is taken moſtly from the Mouths of thoſe who have experienc'd God's Mercy this way, and whoſe Dangers have been as great as any could be on this ſide the Grave; yet God, in his Mercy, delivered them out of all. The reſt are taken from ſuch Reverend <hi>Authors,</hi> that their Credit and Integrity is indiſputable, being purpoſely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to raiſe the Minds of Men to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate and adore the Love and Goodneſs of the All wiſe Creator of the Univerſe, and may indifferently ſerve to this end as well at <hi>Land</hi> as <hi>Sea,</hi> though chiefly intended for <hi>Sea-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> Men, to put them in Mind, when they read it, of their Danger, and what they may expect in their Danger from the Death they apprehend in it, if they apply their Hearts to true Wiſdom. When all Help or Hopes fail or ſeem to be at a loſs, then fix your Hearts and Eyes ſtedfaſtly on him who is able to do all things, and to whom nothing is impoſſible; on him, in whoſe Hands is all the
<pb facs="tcp:0114800200:6"/>Breath of Life, who can ſtop the Shafts of Death in their winged Motion, check the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Thunder in the Mid Volley, and turn the Raging of the Winds to a ſudden Calm.</p>
            <p>But not to be tedious in a <hi>Preface;</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this to you, as a ſuitable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in your Voyages or Travels, nay in your Houſes, or at all times, that you may know theſe things are the <hi>Lord's doing tho' they are Marvellous in your Eyes.</hi> And ſo conclude, ſubſcribing my ſelf,</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0114800200:11"/>their Spirits ſink now as low as they were lifted up high; and now the poor Seamen are like their Ship, one while mounted up in hopes to Heaven, and another while they are ſunk down again in deſpair as low as Hell; they know not now of another Cake, another Morſel, they are reduc'd to their former Exigency, which brings them to a reſolve to ſteer in this ſtrait their old courſe; to Lots they go again the ſecond time, only they have ſuch an Honour for the Providence of God, they will not put him into condemnation, that God hath acquitted; the Lot now falls upon another Perſon, and O now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the old trouble, and inteſtine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, how they ſhall find in their Hearts, to puniſh one, that never had offended any of them; and while one thinks of it, ſays he, <hi>Alas poor Man, what hath he done to deſerve this Sentence?</hi> another crys, <hi>Will not this Blood cleave to my Conſcience another day; tho' I went to this expedition a Preſt Soldier?</hi> another ſays, <hi>for his part he fees no way but Death, therefore he cannot take away Life, when he ſees not any Life can be preſerved by it:</hi> but they are call'd again to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, before they put the Knife to the Throat of this Sacrifice, and they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the laſt Encouragement to put Life into almoſt the Dead-mens Prayers; they

               <p>Theſe good Men ſailed half the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel over, about 500 Leagues, where they met with great diſtreſs of Weather, which broke off the Rudder of their Ship, and occaſioned a deſperate Leak to ſpring in her, which expos'd them to imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but they in this diſtreſs endeavour to hang on their Rudder again, but often were they fruſtrated in their attempt, to a total deſpair of effecting it. They alſo laboured with the like unſucceſsfulneſs to find out and ſtop the Leak; this poor Ships Crew had labour'd alſo by pumping to keep the Ship above Water, until all their few Hands were feeble, and all their Hearts faint; ſo that as ſo many <hi>deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons</hi> of Life, they ceaſe all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,

Then he encouraged them to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt to faſten the Rudder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they could not poſſibly make towards any Point for Shore. He after adviſed them to clear the Ship, as well as they could, from Water by Pumping, which they did happily effect, the Leak being ſtopt providentially of it ſelf,—

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0114800200:28"/>in ſeveral Paſſengers, Capt. <hi>Sale</hi> being Chief, and Capt. <hi>Lane</hi> and his Family, who came from <hi>London</hi> with him as his Aſſiſtant in the management of the Deſign; ſo they, in purſuit of the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, came to an Iſland call'd <hi>Cicatra,</hi> he lay down in the Platts, where they could not at preſent find an Harbour. So they ſent out their <hi>Shallop</hi> upon a Diſcovery, which upon Return, inform'd them of a better place to Ride in.—But ſending out the <hi>Shallop</hi> again upon a Diſcovery, before ſhe Return'd, there aroſe a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Storm, that carried her immediately upon the <hi>Rocks,</hi> and ſtav'd her, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much difficulty moſt of the People were ſav'd, and ſome Proviſions. Then were they Reduc'd to very great ſtraits formidable to Fleſh and Blood, a Barren Iſland, no Inhabitants, no likelihood of Relief, little Proviſions left; in this great ſtrait moſt of them reſolv'd to Travel up to the Weſtern end of the Iſland, and there to abide. Capt. <hi>Lane</hi> and his Family, and Son, who was Lieutenant, reſolv'd to ſeek for ſome kind of Proviſions, and ſo ſtaid on the Iſland. But Captain <hi>Sale</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Bounly,</hi> who had been Maſter of the Ship, and ſome other <hi>Seamen,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Shadwel,</hi> in all eight, reſolv'd to go
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0114800200:29"/>to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and took what Proviſions they could get, which was one <hi>Shark;</hi> but before they made to the Land, they were in very great want; for from this Iſland from whence they departed to <hi>Virginia,</hi> was 300 Leagues: In their now great Extremity, Providence car'd for them, ſo that they got another <hi>Shark,</hi> and were glad to eat him Raw. They were 11 days going to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Boat</hi> a very little one, that they could ſcarcely Steer in her for fear of Danger. Yet the Lord, in this deep Deſtreſs, <hi>made his Arm bare for their Salvation,</hi> and brought them ſafe to a place call'd <hi>Nuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Rich.

In the laſt day of the week, upon a time it prov'd a very ſtormy Day, and they being abroad a hunting for ſome ſupport, could get nothing. The Husband and Son come home very much troubled, and the Men that were gone into the Woods they could get nothing; and they being very much troubled, one took up a Reſolution not to come home, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there Captain would not ſuffer them to go and hunt on the Lord's-Day; on the other hand they thought he would wonder what was become of them, and fear leſt evil had befallen them; ſo they alter their Reſolution to come home, but empty of Relief; this very Evening before the Sabbath in this perplexity of thoughts, there fly over their Heads three gray <hi>Geeſe;</hi> a wonder it was, for ſuch <hi>Geeſe</hi> were never before ſeen there nor after.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0114800200:65"/>befel them: The Wind blowing hard into the <hi>Cove,</hi> and their Anchor coming home, their Shallop ſunk into the <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſo wet all their Proviſion, and ſome of it they found ſwimming up and down by the ſhoar: The ſight thereof, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully troubled them, to ſee the beſt part of their Proviſion, the only hope of their Lives under God, in danger either utterly to be loſt, or to be ſpoil'd by the <hi>Sea-water,</hi> for which they had taken ſuch pains, and run ſo many adventures in the getting of it: and in this their Miſery, they ſaw but one remedy, and that was a deſperate one, <hi>viz.</hi> to turn into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrote <hi>Sea</hi> to their Shallops to ſave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Proviſions, now ready to be waſh'd away by the Billows: This they did, and by main force drew the Shallops to the ſhore; then they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by the <hi>Sea-ſide</hi> to gather up ſuch of their Proviſions as were ſwimming up and down: and when the Weather prov'd fair, they went on to <hi>Bell-ſound:</hi> where being arriv'd, they took out their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and viewed the great Tent which was built of Timber and Boards, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Tiles: The uſe of it was for the <hi>Coopers</hi> to Work and Lodge in whilſt they made Casks for the putting up of the Train-Oyl; and they reſolved to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0114800200:66"/>build another ſmaller Tent within that for their Habitations; and accordingly, taking down a leſſer Tent that ſtood near to it, wherein the Land-men lay whilſt they made their Oyl, they fetch'd their materials from thence, both Boards, Poſts, and Rafters, and from the Chimnies of the Furnaces, they took a thouſand Bricks; they found alſo four Hogſheads of Lime, which mingled with ſand from the ſhoar, made good Mortar; But the Weather was grown ſo extream cold, that they were fain to make 2 Fires on both ſides, to keep their Mortar from freezing; then they raiſed a Wall of one Brick thickneſs againſt the inner Planks of the ſide of the Tent, but by that time they had Wall'd 2 ſides of their Houſe, their Bricks fail'd, ſo that they were forc'd to build the other 2 ſides of Boards; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nail'd on both ſides the Poſts, they were hollow between, which they fill'd up with Sand, that made it ſo tite, that the leaſt breath of Air could not poſſibly annoy them. The length of this Tent was 20 foot, and the breadth 16; their Chimney was the breadth of a Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and 4 foot high; they Ciel'd it with Boards of 5 or 6 times double, that no Wind could poſſibly get thro': The Door they made as cloſe as they could,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0114800200:67"/>and lin'd it with a Bed that they found there, which came over both the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhutting of it: they made no Windows, having no light but what came thro' the Chimney: then ſet they up 4 Cabins, quartering themſelves two and two in a Cabin; their Beds were the Deer-skins dry'd, which was a warm and comfortable Lodging for them in their Diſtreſs: Their next care was for Firing, and finding 7 old Shallops which were unſerviceable, they brake them up, and ſtow'd them over the beams of the great Tent to make it the warmer, and to keep the Snow from driving thro' the Tiles into the Tent: and by this time the cold increaſing, and ſcarce having any Day at all, they ſtav'd ſome emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cask, and brake two old Coolers (wherein they cool their Oyl) provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever Firing they could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to the next Years Voyage: yet conſidering the ſmall quantity of Fewel, the extremity of Cold, and the long time of their aboad, they Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as thriftily as poſſibly they could.</p>
               <p>Having thus fitted every thing in the beſt manner they could, on the 12 of <hi>Sept.</hi> looking out into the Sound, they eſpy'd 2 Sea-Horſes lying a Sleep on a piece of Ice, whereupon, taking up an
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0114800200:68"/>old harping-iron, they haſten'd to them, and firſt ſlew the old one, and the the young,; and ſo bringing them aſhore, they flay'd them, roaſted, and eat them. Not long after they kill'd another; but the Nights and cold. Weather increaſing on them, and they viewing their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, found it too ſmall by half; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſtinted themſelves to one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Meal a day, and agreed to faſt <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> excepting from the Greaves and Fritters of the Whale (which was a very loathſome Meat) of which they allow'd themſelves ſufficient for their preſent Hunger: at which Diet they continu'd for about 3 Months.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed whatever they could invent for their Preſervation; they found that all their Clothes and Shoes were worn, and torn; to repair which, they had this new device, of Rope-yarn they made Thread, and of Whale-bones Needles to ſow their Clothes withal: But <hi>Octob.</hi> 10. the Nights being grown very long, and the Cold ſo violent, that all the Sea was Frozen over; and they having now nothing to exerciſe their Minds upon, were troubled with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand imaginations: Sometimes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd <hi>their abſence from their Wives and Children, thinking what grief it would be to

And being tormented in their Minds with Fear, and Grief, and pinched in their Bodies with Hunger, and Cold, the hideous Monſter of Deſperation, preſented his uglieſt ſhape unto them: But thinking it not beſt to give way to Grief and Fear, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then for the preſervation of their Veniſon, and lengthening of their Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they thought beſt to roaſt every day half a Deer, and to ſtow it in Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, which accordingly they did, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much raw as would ſerve to roaſt every <hi>Sabbath day</hi> a quarter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when this was over, they began again to think of their enſuing Miſery, that in caſe God ſhould give them Life, yet they were to live as Baniſhed Men from all Company; and as if their Sorrows had been too little, they preſently found an increaſe of it; for their Whale-Frit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, after they had been drench'd in the

               <p>In the beginning of this darkneſs, they ſought ſome means to preſerve Light, and finding a piece of Sheet-Lead, and ſome Oyl in the Coopers Tent, and Rope-yarn they made a Lamp, which they kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning, which was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them in their extremity; yet their Wants and Miſeries were ſo many, and great, that ſometimes they brake forth into impatient Speeches againſt the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of them, but then their Conſciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0114800200:71"/>minded them after their own <hi>Evil deſerts,</hi> and ſo they took it as a juſt Hand of God for their former wicked Lives; or that God intended to make them Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Mercy in their wonderful deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: <hi>Humbling themſelves therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty Hand of God, they proſtrated themſelves in Prayer two or three times a day,</hi> which courſe they conſtantly held all the time of their Miſery.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> as the days began to lengthen, the cold began to ſtrengthen; which proceeded to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that it raiſed bliſters on their Fleſh as if they had been burnt with Fire, and if at any time they touched Iron, it would ſtick to their Fingers like Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime: If they went out of Doors to fetch in a little Water it would ſo pinch them, that they were ſore as if they had been beaten.

               <p>By the laſt of <hi>Jan.</hi> the Days were 7 or 8 Hours long, and then viewing their Victuals again, they found that it would not laſt above ſix Weeks longer, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0114800200:72"/>made them fear further Famine; but <hi>they had recourſe to God,</hi> who they knew, could ſupply them beyond their hopes.</p>
               <p>Looking out on a bright day, they ſaw a great ſhe Bear with her Cub coming toward their Tent, whereupon Arming themſelves with their Lances, the went forth, and ſtaid her coming; ſhe ſoon caſt her greedy Eye upon them, and hoping to devour them, haſted towards them: But with their Lances they gave her ſuch an hearty welcome, that ſhe tumbled upon the Ground, biting the Snow for anger: The Cub ſeeing this, eſcap'd by flight: The Weather was ſo extream Cold, that they were fain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to retire into the Tent, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmed themſelves, they drew in the dead Bear, wherewith they Dined merrily; and this Bear ſerv'd them 20 days: Only this miſchance they had, Eating her Liver, it made their Skins peel off; when ſhe was ſpent, they yet fear'd that their Veniſon would not hold out till the Fleet came out of <hi>England;</hi> but God ſent many Bears to their Tent, by times, at leaſt 40, whereof they kill'd 7; One of which was exceeding great, at leaſt 6 Foot High; ſo that their Food in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, they kept not themſelves to ſuch ſhort Commons, but oft Eat two or three

               <p>By this, the chearful Days lengthen'd ſo faſt, that ſeveral ſort of Fowl reſorted thither. <hi>March</hi> 16. one of their Maſtiffs went abroad which they never ſaw after; upon the coming of the Fowls, the Foxes, which all Winter had kept their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughts under the Rocks, came abroad to ſeek for their livings; whereupon they ſet up Traps, which they baited with the Skins of theſe Fowls, by which means they caught at times 50 Foxes; all which they roaſted, and found to be good Meat: Then taking the Bear-skins, laying the Fleſhy ſide upwards, and making Springs of Whale-bone, the caught about ſixty Fowls as big as Pigeons.</p>

                  <hi>May</hi> 1.

The ſame Day there came two Ships of <hi>Hull</hi> into the Sound, who knowing that ſome Men had been leſt there the Year before, being very deſirous to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>This was no ſmall cauſe of Sorrow to the Relater; the thoughts of their Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Barbarous actions, ſometimes ſurrounded him with Fears and Sorrows, hourly expecting to taſte of the ſaid Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.

But the great God, that is moſt compaſſionate in the greateſt extremities, had pity on him, and notwithaſtnding the alteration of the Climate, and the want of Clothes, and the ſtrangeneſs of his Food, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0114800200:80"/>was only Herbs, he continu'd in good Health, and had time enough to lament their direful Providence. The Natives who were daily expecting another Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, met with a diſappointment: either their Cuoſtms, or the over-ruling Power of God, would not ſuffer them to deſtroy him, he continuing ſtill in Health. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reſolve to ſell him: his <hi>Arannia,</hi> or Maſter, was pretty free to Diſcourſe him, which the Relator was capable of, being about 3 Years before in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where he had learn'd the <hi>Tata</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which is eaſily attain'd, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in a very few words, and all the <hi>Negroes</hi> ſpeak it. He began to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe his Maſter, to know <hi>the reaſon of their Cruelty,</hi> who told him, that <hi>he ſhould reſt himſelf contented, who if he were not Sick, ſhould not have his Head cut off.</hi> In the Boat, which in the beginning they took with them, was a Musket ſav'd of the 3 which was not diſcharg'd; which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſome time after he had been with him, brought to him to know <hi>the uſe of it:</hi> he endeavour'd as much as he could to make him apprehend the uſe of it, but ſtill they profeſt their ignorance: but they commanded and threaten'd him to ſhew the uſe of it. The fear of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Diſpleaſure and their Inhumanity,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0114800200:81"/>cauſed him to ſhoot it off; but the <hi>Negroes,</hi> which expected ſome delightful thing, were fruſtrated, and at the ſudden noiſe and flaſh of Fire (which they very much dread) ran from him, and were greatly affrighted; but quickly after, hearing no more of that noiſe, they came up to him again, and commanded him to <hi>do the like:</hi> He told them <hi>he had not Powder, which was the cauſe of the noiſe;</hi> but this would not ſatisfie theſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> He not being able to anſwer their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they concluded he was not willing, they proceed to threaten him, and were about to Murder him, had not his Maſter reſcu'd him. Upon Diſcourſe after with this <hi>Arannia,</hi> or Maſter, he began to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reaſon of their barbarous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him and his Friends, he telling him <hi>that naturally the People were Civil and ſimply Honeſt, but if provoked, full of Revenge;</hi> and that <hi>this Cruelty was occaſion'd by ſome unhandſome action of carrying a Native away without their leave, about a Year before; they reſolving if any came aſhore, they ſhould never go off alive.</hi> He had not been above 7 Weeks in the Country, but his Maſter preſented him to his King, whoſe Name was <hi>E fn-me,</hi> King of the <hi>Blackamoors,</hi> who immediately gave him to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe Name was <hi>Oni-jah,</hi> and when
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0114800200:82"/>the King went abroad, he attended him alſo as his Page, throughout the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above 12 Miles, yet boaſting extreamly of his Power and Strength, but glorying exceedingly that he had a <hi>White</hi> to attend him, whom he employ'd to carry his Bow and Arrows; at ſeveral places remote from the Sea-ſide, the People would run away from him for fear, others would fall down and ſeem to Worſhip him, and and uſe thoſe actions as they do to their Gods. Their Pregreſs was never ſo long, but they could return home at Night, but never without a handſome load of a Cup of the Creature. During all the time of the Relater's ſervitude there, he never knew him go abroad and come home Sober. They drink of the beſt <hi>Palm-Wine,</hi> and another ſort of ſtrong Liquor, call'd <hi>Penrore.</hi> The Relater quickly knew how to humour this profound Prince, and if any of the Natives abus'd him, upon his complaint, he had redreſs, as once by ſtriving with a <hi>Negroe,</hi> his Arm was broke, which by Providence more than Skill, was ſet again. After ſome Months, the King of <hi>Ca-al nanch,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>E-fn mancha,</hi> hearing of this beautiful <hi>White,</hi> courted his Neighbour Prince, that he would ſell him to him; at length they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0114800200:83"/>ſtruck a bargain, and the Relator was ſold for <hi>a Cow and a Goat;</hi> this King was a very ſober and moderate Perſon, free from Treacheries and Miſchiefs, that the other was ſubject unto; and he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Diſcourſe the Relater, and ask him of <hi>his King and Country,</hi> and <hi>if his Kingdoms and Dominions were as big as his,</hi> which were not above 25 Miles in length, and and 15 in breadth. He told him as much as his Underſtanding and Years made him capable of, keeping ſtill in the bounds of Modeſty, and yet relating as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the <hi>Honour and Dignity of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;</hi> firſt informing him of <hi>the greatneſs of one of his Kingdoms, the ſeveral Shires and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it contained, with the number of its Cities, Towns and Caſtles, and the ſtrength of each, the infinite number of Inhabitants, and valour of his Subjects.</hi> One of theſe Kingdoms was enough to amaze ſufficiently this petty Governour, that he need not to mention any more of his Majeſties Glory and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It put him in to ſuch a profound conſternation, that he reſolved to find out ſome way to tender his Reſpects to this mighty Prince, and no way could he find ſo convenient, as to tell the Relater, that <hi>if he could find but a paſſage, he would let him go to</hi> England, <hi>to tell his Majeſty of the great Favour and Reſpect he had for him.</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0114800200:84"/>This did not a little rejoice our <hi>Engliſh-man.</hi> Withal the King told him, that <hi>he would ſend him a Preſent, which ſhould be two Cabareets or Goats,</hi> which they do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at a very high rate; the King having not above 16 or 18. He tells the King, that <hi>the K. of</hi> England <hi>had many thouſands of his Subjects that were under the Degree of Genlemen, which had a thouſand of Sheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; the Fleſh of which, they valu'd at a very much higher rate than Goats.</hi> Tho' our <hi>Engliſh man</hi> liv'd very handſomely with this <hi>E-fn man-cha,</hi> King of the <hi>Ca-la-nanch,</hi> yet his deſires and his hopes were ſtill for his Native Country: At length he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Promiſe from his King, that <hi>the firſt</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship that came into that Road, ſhould have liberty to Releaſe or Purchaſe him;</hi> this very much rejoic'd his Heart: Now he thought ev'ry day a year, till he could hear of, or ſee ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship arriv'd. Many times when he was alone, his Heart would be oppreſs'd with Sighs and Sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, when he thought of his Relations, and the comfortable Society that they had together; that it ſhould be his ſad Lot to be Captivated amongſt barbarous Infidels. Oftentimes did he walk down to the Sea-ſide, ſometimes with Hopes, ſometimes with Fear, earneſtly expecting the Wind of God's Providence to blow in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0114800200:85"/>ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship thither: His often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Sea-ſide was diſcern'd by one <hi>Ja-ga,</hi> a Wizard, and the chiefeſt in 3 or 4 Kingdoms there-abouts; they are Perſons that the Natives give very much credit to, and on any difficult Occaſion, run to them for ſatisfaction. The famous <hi>Delphia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n Oracle</hi> was never had in greater Adoration, than the Prophetical Speeches of theſe <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Wizards. Tho' they have infinite numbers of them in every place, yet this <hi>Ja-ga</hi> had the moſt renown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and one day he comes to him, and very kindly ask'd him, <hi>Why he ſo very often frequented that place?</hi> He told him, <hi>To ſee if he could diſcover any</hi> Engliſh <hi>Veſſel to come in there:</hi> But he being not acquainted with his great Fame, askt him, <hi>When he did belive there would one come in?</hi> Not that he was willing to give credit to any of their Divinations, but ſuppoſing that he thereby ſhould pleaſe him, and anſwer his expectation. <hi>Ja ga</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately told him, <hi>That the</hi> 15 <hi>day after an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship ſhould come into the Road.</hi> Then he askt him, <hi>Whether that Ship ſhould carry him away.</hi> To which he anſwer'd doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but told him, <hi>That he ſhould be offer'd to the Maſter of the Ship, that they would not agree that he ſhould come to Shore again, and he ſhould not be Sold, but in a very
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0114800200:86"/>ſhort time after, he ſhould die for Grief.</hi> Theſe 15 Days ſeem'd very long and tedious; many a look did he caſt on the Sea with an aking Heart: The 14 Day he went to the higheſt Hill thereabout, but to no purpoſe, for he could diſcover no Ship: the next Morning he went again 2 or 3 times but ſaw none: about 2 or 3 Hours after came running into <hi>Efn-mancha,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and told him there was a Canoe coming, ſo they call'd our Ships; at which our <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> heartily rejoic'd, hoping then to be Releas'd forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, yet durſt not ſhew his joy for fear of Puniſhment, or of Death; for tho' he liv'd better now than with his firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, yet his Service was far worſe than the Slaves in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and their Diet worſe than Dogs-Meat; therefore had he cauſe enough of inward Joy; the Ship came immediately in, and he highs away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to <hi>Ja-ga,</hi> to know if it were an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, who reſolv'd him that it was; it happen'd to be the St. <hi>Maloes</hi> Merchant, Capt. <hi>Royden</hi> Commander, who haſten'd to diſpatch his Buſineſs, took in his <hi>Negroes,</hi> and was ready to Sail, and our <hi>Engliſh man</hi> heard never a word what ſhould become of him, the King never offering to ſell him; this put him on a reſolution to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make an eſcape, and to that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0114800200:87"/>end had prepar'd a piece of Timber which he had drawn near the Water-ſide, on which he intended to paddle to the Ship which then lay about a League from the ſhore. Juſt by the Sea-ſide; as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Launch his little floating Stick, he eſpy'd a great <hi>Aligator,</hi> which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Man at a Mouthful; this made him alter his Reſolution, and reſolve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to live with Inhuman Infidels, than to throw himſelf into ſo imminent a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which would have been little leſs than Self-murder. But the next day, which I may call a day of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God open'd the Heart of the King to let the poor <hi>Engliſh man</hi> go: He ſent him in a <hi>Canoe,</hi> plac'd between a <hi>Negroe's</hi> Legs, with ſome others to guide this ſmall Veſſel, for fear he ſhould leap over-board and Swim to the Ship. At a diſtance from the Ship he Hal'd her in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, which was no ſmall cauſe of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to thoſe on Board to hear an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue out of their <hi>Canoes:</hi> The <hi>Negroes</hi> gave him leave to ſtand up and ſhew himſelf to the Captain, to whom he gave an Account <hi>how four were left there, and only he preſerv'd.</hi> It was a pretty while before they could ſtrike a Bargain, tho' the Captain was reſolv'd not to leave him behind. Several times the <hi>Negroes</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0114800200:88"/>padled away with their <hi>Canoe,</hi> reſolving not to part with him; but what with his entreaties and promiſes, he perſuaded them to the Ship again, and they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him on Board for 45 Copper Bars and Iron Bars; each Copper Bar being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſs of a Youth's little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Iron Bars a little bigger. Now were his Joys compleated, he thought himſelf, as it were, <hi>caught up into the third Heavens;</hi> he could hardly perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but it was a Dream or Viſion, and that he did not really ſee <hi>Engliſh</hi> Faces, or embrace <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bodies. It was ſome time before he could throw himſelf at the Captains Feet, and acknowledge his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite cauſe of Joy in himſelf, and <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him for his Deliverance from ſuch a ſevere Captivity;</hi> that <hi>he that lately was a Slave to Infidels, that worſhip they know not what, ſhould now ſee the Faces of Chriſtians, and join with them in Worſhipping the true God;</hi> and to him firſt he offer'd up the Sacrifice of hearty Thankſgiving, that had ſent his Angel to redeem him from ſo cruel a Bondage. When he came on Board, his Hair was very Long, and his Skin Tawny (<hi>Malatto</hi>-like) having gone Naked all the time he was there, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently anointing himſelf with <hi>Palm Oyl</hi> he look'd like a <hi>Tawny-Moor;</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0114800200:89"/>the Seamen aboard, with Chriſtian-like Hearts, Apparell'd him. The Maſter commanded to hoiſt Sail, and having a fair Wind, they Sail'd to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where Capt. <hi>Royden</hi> was to tarry ſome time; but the Relator earneſtly deſiring to go to his Native Country, and his Ralations, got paſſage to the <hi>Downs,</hi> in the <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Capt. <hi>South</hi> Commander, which through God's Goodneſs, in a few Weeks arriv'd in the <hi>Downs,</hi> where the Relater was put on ſhore to his Uncle, Mr. <hi>Rich.

Oh! the freer any favour is, the more it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; Doth God ſee any thing in us, or in our Families, more than others, to beſtow ſuch deliverances for?

            <p n="3">3. Our Dangers and Deliverances ſhould be remembred, becauſe God hath gracious ends and deſigns both in the one and the other; What ends hath God to bring us into dangers? 1.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0114800200:126"/>a Perſon is convinced of the duty of Prayer, but it may be neglected; Oh then God will bring him into danger to quicken him to his duty; Oh, ſays God, <hi>In their affiction they will ſeek me early.</hi> The very Heathen Mariners called out for Prayer in time of danger. Obſerve it, that Perſons convinced of duties, either Perſonal or Domeſtical, and yet neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God uſually whips them to their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by one danger, affliction or another. The Proverb is good, <hi>if you wonld teach a Man to Pray, ſend him to Sea.</hi> 2. God by bringing us into dangers, hath a deſign upon us to convince us of ſin; many Convictions have come into the Soul at this door; Dangers have often proved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to Convictions. Oh! What Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have many poor Souls lain under while in danger, when it may be the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have given them a view of Eternity; when Dangers have preſented Death to the Man, and Conſcience hath cried, <hi>Now thou art ſinking, now there is but a ſtep betwixt thee and Eternity, betwixt thee and and another World?</hi> Oh then what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions hath the Soul lain under? and yet it may be when the Danger is over, the Conviction is over too. Well, though we may forget all, yet God remembers all. 3. God hath a deſign upon us in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0114800200:127"/>our Dangers, to prepare us for our latter end. The danger thou wert in, and have eſcaped, calls for thee to prepare for thy Death, which muſt certainly come to paſs ſhortly. God by Dangers would have you prepare for Death: And Oh! What a cutting Conſideration will this be when thou comeſt to die? that thou who haſt been in ſo many dangers by Sea and Land, ſhouldſt have no more learned to die, nor art yet ready to die. Alas, you eſcaped the laſt, that you might prepare for the next. 4. God hath a deſign upon our Graces by bringing us into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Danger is to evert and draw forth Grace. Thus the Diſciples Dangers at Sea were to draw forth their Faith. Faith and Patience come moſt viſibly upon the ſtage in times of moſt imminent Danger.</p>

The Goodneſs of God was the Aggravation of the Sin of <hi>David,</hi> ſays God, <hi>When I had done ſo and ſo for thee, nay, and I would have done more, wherefore haſt thou diſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, to do Evil in his Sight,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.8, 9.

                     <item>5. Deliverances and Dangers forgotten, will cauſe the Lord to pull in his Hand in a way of Mercy, will cauſe God to give up Perſons, and take his Protecting Preſence from them, take them from the ſhadow of his Wings. Souls by forgetting paſt Dangers and Deliverances, may put themſelves from under God's Protection for the future.</item>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Is it ſo that we are to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Sea-dangers and Deliverances? then it is a word of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted then to call to mind, and keep in mind, what God hath done for you; and in this Exhortation I addreſs my ſelf to Sea-faring Men, whoſe lives are a courſe and ſeries of Wonders in their frequent Salvations and Preſervations, (witneſs this Treatiſe) as you <hi>ſee the wonders of God in the Deeps, (viz.)</hi> The wonders of his Creation, ſo do you ſee the wonders of his Salvation: How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten may <hi>Wonderful</hi> be Written upon the Head of Salvations that you are every Voyage receiving from God? you never go out, and come home, but God works <hi>Wonderfully,</hi> and appears <hi>Wonderfully</hi> for you; Is not he a Wonder-working-God for you every Voyage?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Exhortation</hi> is to call to mind, and keep in mind, to Record and Regiſter your Dangers and Deliverances, and not to do as <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to do, who ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his Works. How often doth God bring this ſin of theirs in one <hi>Pſalm? They forgot his works, and the wonders he had ſhewed them, Pſal.</hi> 106.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.11.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Keep them in mind, for they are wonderful Dangers and Deliverances;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0114800200:133"/>They are Wonders, theſe are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. <hi>Marvellous things did he for them, in the ſight of their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He divided the Sea, and cauſed them to paſs through, and he made the waters to ſtand as an heap, Pſal.</hi> 78.12, 13. And it is brought in again in that <hi>Pſalm, They remembred not his hand, nor the day when God delivered them out of the hand of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.42. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>They forgot God their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which had done great things in Egypt, Wondrous works in the Land of Ham, Pſal.</hi> 106.21, 22. This heightens the and ſin exceedingly to forget ſuch Great Wonderful Dangers and Deliverances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Reſpect, they are often ſuch as threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a ſentence of Death to be executed upon you. May it not be ſaid of poor Sea-men, as was of them; <hi>For we would not (Brethren) have you ignorant of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which came to us in Aſia, that we were preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that we deſpaired of Life; but we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in him that raiſeth the dead, who delivered us from ſo great a Death, and doth Deliver,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.8, 9, 10. O how many Sea-faring
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0114800200:134"/>Men may ſay thus! <hi>Our Dangers have been ſuch, as we have often deſpaired of Life; there hath been but a little betwixt us and Death; nay, betwixt us and Eternity;</hi> And ſhall we forget ſuch dangers, when we have been ſo near death in them? As he ſaid to <hi>David, As the Lord lives, there is but one ſtep betwixt thee and death.</hi> O how often have you been near ſinking, near drowning, and yet God hath then appeared for you, with an outſtreached Arm, and in the Mount hath he been ſeen, And will you not remember this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Reſpect, they are ſudden and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, they are wonderfully ſudden; threatned with nothing but preſent Death and Deſtruction? It may be ſaid of Sea-men, as of thoſe in <hi>Job, Snares compaſſed them about, and ſudden fear trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them,</hi> Job 22.10. It doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble them, but all on a ſudden trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, before they know almoſt where they are (as we ſay;) We read of ſome whoſe Calamity ſhall come ſuddenly. <hi>Suddenly ſhall he be broken without Remedy,</hi> Prov. 6.15. O how terrible is ſuch a caſe, or ſuch a danger! And hath not God often threatened to make this your caſe and condition? O then do not forget ſuch dangers that have ſo ſuddenly lookt you in the Face!</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:0114800200:135"/>3. Your Dangers are Wonderful in this Reſpect, they are not Dangers in which your Bodies are concerned only, but they are Dangers in which your Souls are concerned; It is not only the danger of a Shipwrack'd Veſſel, and a Ship-wrack'd Eſtate, and a Shipwrack'd Body, but a Shipwrack'd Soul. Here is the great danger, leſt thou make a loſt Voyage for thy Soul: If thou hadſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a Storm, or died in the Time of ſuch a Voyage; Oh! What would have become of thy Soul, thy precious, thy immortal Soul? Hadſt not thou died in a Carnal, in a Chriſtleſs ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Had not they poor Soul periſh'd to all Eternity, if thou then hadſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried? Waſt not thou then a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger altogether to Chriſt, and a Work of Saving Grace upon thy Heart? Hadſt not thou then the guilt of all thy ſins upon the back of thy Soul unpardoned? And O what danger was this! And wilt thou forget ſuch dangers?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Dangers are ſuch at Sea, as none but a God can deliver from; all your skill cannot; O, then is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Artiſt at his Wits end! The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt tells us, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.27.) <hi>the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their Storms, are at their wits end;</hi> (or as ſome read it) <hi>all their wiſdom is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0114800200:136"/>ſwallowed up, they know not what courſe to ſteer,</hi> (the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annorators carry it,) <hi>Now their very Pilots are at a loſs: Now all their courage cannot contribute to their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though men of the greateſt natural cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and magnanimity in the world: Yet now their Hearts melt becauſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> as it ſaid of the Mariners in <hi>Jonah's</hi> Ship, <hi>The Mariners were afraid.</hi> O now, when Death and Eternity, the Grave and Judgment to come looks them in the face! Then they are <hi>Magor-Miſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibs,</hi> terror to themſelves, and to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; O then, the danger is ſuch, it muſt be only the finger of God that can help! I have heard of a Ship in <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Road, that in a great Storm, they feared the Anchor would come home, and the Maſter diſcourſing with a Youth in the Ship, that God had begun lately to work ſome Convictions upon, <hi>O ſays he,</hi> Maſter, <hi>if God do but lay a Finger upon one Strand of the Cable, it will hold;</hi> and in the morning many Ships were loſt near them, and there was but one Strand in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble left. O the ſinger of God only can ſave in ſome dangers. It was a good ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Godly Commander of a Ship in imminent danger, <hi>None now but that God that ſaved the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>at the Red Sea, can ſave us out of this diſtreſs;</hi> and as ſoon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0114800200:137"/>as he had ſaid it, the Wind altered, and ſaved them; And will you forget ſuch dangers as none but a God can ſave from?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Your dangers at Sea are ſuch as many thouſands have periſhed in; how many have gone to Sea, that never returned more? that have been ſwallowed up in the belly of the great Deeps? How many have periſhed by the Sword at Sea? how many by violent Storms? and that God ſhould put a difference betwixt you and others, and you ſhould forget it, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly heightens and aggravates the guilt. How many have loſt their lives? how many have loſt their limbs? and yet in ſuch dangers God hath brought you off; this is never to be forgotten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your dangers are not only wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but your deliverances are ſo too, and therefore ſhould be remembred. There is never a deliverance, but you may read a wonder in it; ſo many deliverances and ſalvations at Sea, ſo many wonders. God ſaves you in a miraclous way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is not this a wonder, that perſons of ſuch great ſins and provocations, ſhould be perſons of ſuch great ſalvations and preſervations? that ſuch as ſin every Voyage, nay, it may be at an high rate ſin every Voyage, ſhould be ſaved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at ſuch an high rate every Voyage?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0114800200:138"/>is not this a wonder, that Men of ſuch ſins, ſhould be men of ſuch ſalvations? that men that ſin againſt theſe ſalvations, ſhould not have theſe deliverances ſhorten upon them. Oh what a wonder is this! We ſhould wonder if a perſon ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſobliging any of us, and yet we ſhould be ſtill heaping up kindneſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: This made the Prophet <hi>Ezra</hi> ſay, <hi>Shall we again break his Commandments, after ſuch deliverances as this?</hi> O do not you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord every time that you go out and ſtill he delivers you, ſtill he returns you to your Relations, to viſit your habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in peace! and is not this a wonder?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Your deliverances are wonderful, if you conſider your deliverances are great deliverances. We read of ſuch; <hi>And the Lord ſaved them with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;</hi> or with a great Salvation. Thus ſaid <hi>Sampſon, Thou haſt given this great deliverance into the hand of thy Servant,</hi> (Judg 15.11.) Now any great tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are remembred and recorded. Your deliverances are great, if we conſider theſe things;
<list>
                     <item>1. They are commanded deliverances by the great God; his word of command brings all our deliverances about, whether at Sea or Land. Which made the Church in diſtreſs pray, <hi>Thou art my King, O God, command deliverances
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0114800200:139"/>for</hi> Jacob, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.4.) He commands every thing tending to deliverance at Sea; in order to deliverance, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Winds; <hi>He maketh the Storm a Calm,</hi> (Pſal. 107, 29.) He alſo commands the Seas; <hi>He ſays to the proud Waves, So far, and no farthar.</hi> You read of a decree ſet to the Sea, to command the Sea, that it cannot paſs; <hi>Though the Waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet can they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; though they roar, yet can they not paſs over it,</hi> (Jer. 5.22.) It is the great God only that rides Lord Admiral at Sea, to command the Seas and the Waves thereof. God is ſaid to ſhut up the Sea with doors, and ſet bars upon it, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further; and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtay'd,</hi> (Job. 38.8, 11.) <hi>Xerxes</hi> preſum'd he could tame the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Bridge of Boats; but all this was in vain, this is a flower in God's Crown alone, to command the Sea. Your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances are a fruit and effect of God's commanding Power, therefore great.</item>
                     <item>2. They are great deliverances, as they are the curious workmanſhip (as I may call them) of the Attributes of a great God. Deliverance is ſaid to be wrought for us, it is the handy work of God; <hi>If God will work, who can let?</hi> (as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.13, 14.) And he ſeems to ſpeak
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0114800200:140"/>it upon the account of the deliverance of his People: <hi>For your ſake I have ſent done to Babylon, and have brought down all their Nobles, and the Chaldeans, whoſe cry is in their ſhips.</hi> In every deliverance there is the excellent work of the Attributes of God; we may in ſuch a deliverance ſay, <hi>Here is the Power of God,</hi> and <hi>here is the Wiſdom of God,</hi> and <hi>here is the Wiſdom of God,</hi> and <hi>here is the Love of God,</hi> and <hi>here is the Faithfulneſs of God,</hi> &amp;c. For as God in the confounding of the Languages at <hi>Babel,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Go to, let us go down,</hi> (as if he directed himſelf to his glorious Throne) <hi>Come, let us go down.</hi> Gen. 11.7. (Or as ſome take it of the Trinity, as in the Creation.) So when God ſends us deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances in our diſtreſſes, he ſets his Attributes at work; <hi>Go Power, go Mercy, go Love, go Faithfulneſs, go and act your reſpective parts in this deliverance;</hi> and muſt not this be then an excellent and curious Piece that God's Attributes brings forth?</item>
                     <item>3. They are great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, if we conſider the great ſins and provocations they come over the heads of, the great unworthineſs of the received, heightens much the mercy and favour received; the reaſon why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do not greaten their deliverances, is becauſe they do not greaten their ſins, in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0114800200:141"/>the deep ſenſe and aggravations of them. O ſuch a Soul would ſay, as <hi>David, is this the manner of Men?</hi> O God, is not this a great deliverance for ſuch a great ſinner to receive?</item>
                     <item>4. They are great Deliverances, if we conſider the time and ſeaſon of their coming in; as this Deliverance of the Ships Company where <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>it was when all hope of being ſaved was taken away;</hi> and ſo were many of the Deliverances, mention'd in this Treatiſe. So <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sea-Deliverance, <hi>when he began to ſink, Chriſt ſtretched forth his hand immediately;</hi> he was now ſinking and going, but ſee how ready Chriſt was to ſave; <hi>He ſtretched forth his hand and caught</hi> Peter, (<hi>Matth</hi> 14.28, 29, 30.) Our ſinking time, is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt's</hi> ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time. <hi>In the Mount is the Lord ſeen;</hi> our extremity is Gods opportunity; and are not then the great deliverances never to be forgotten?</item>
                     <item>5. They are great deliverances, if we conſider they are not only Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Bodies, and Ships, and Eſtates ſometimes, but Souls; and where the Ship is loſt, and the Eſtate is loſt, yet for the life to be ſaved, and the Soul deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a very great Deliverance; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve when a Priſoner is under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, is a great Mercy: O when God Reprieves a poor Priſoner, this is ſome Deliverance; we read of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0114800200:142"/>ſome Deliverance God gave to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the days of <hi>Shiſhak;</hi> a Reprieve is ſome Deliverance, but if it end in ſuing out the Priſoner's Pardon, then it is a great Deliverance. If it be ſuch a Deliverance in a Storm at Sea, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had from a Sickneſs at Shore, <hi>Thou haſt deliver'd me in love to my Soul, and caſt all my Sins behind thy back,</hi> (Iſa. 38.) This is a double De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and ſure ſuch Deliverances as theſe are worth Recording; Theſe are to be written in Marble and not in Duſt, with the Pen of Iron, (as the Prophet ſays) and not with the point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Your Deliverances are wonderful, if you conſider the many thouſands that have periſhed in leſs Dangers to an Eye of Reaſon; they are diſtinguiſhing Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, and therefore wonderful; hath God dealt with all Men that go to Sea as with you. Have not thouſand periſhed by the Sword at Sea in bloody Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Miſcarried at Sea in dreadful and terrible Storms; Hath not the Sea been a Sepulchre for thouſands? Are not there Millions of the Dead that the Sea muſt one Day give up, and yet you Delivered, and yet you Spared? O what diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy is this! And ſhall this be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you? Should not you keep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0114800200:143"/>of diſtinguiſhing Mercy? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſunk ſometimes, and periſhed by your ſides? How many that went out with you that never Returned? One taken, and another left; one ſunk, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Deliverances are Wonderful, if you conſider the way that ſometimes God takes to bring them about; O what ſtrange ways doth God take to Deliver, when he hath a Mind to Deliver; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he brings down to the <hi>very Gate of the Grave,</hi> he brings to the Doors and Bars of the Sea, and then ſhuts theſe Doors; as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, He brings to the next Door to periſhing, and then he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers; <hi>Maſter ſave me, or I periſh;</hi> and then he lends an Arm, witneſs many of theſe Deliverances here mention'd. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth it by ſtrange means; low and contemptible, as the poor Man that we Read of, that Delivered the City, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.15.) ſometimes by unthought of and unexpected means, as he that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Major <hi>Gibbons,</hi> as this Story men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was a <hi>French</hi> Pyrate. As that Ship I have heard of, that when ſhe ſprang a Leak, and they all had like to have periſhed, and all on a ſudden the Leak ſtopt, and they knew no Reaſon, but when they came into the next Port

Theſe are to be remembred to the Lord while you live Oh! Methinks this one Motive ſhould ſet on the Exhortation, if I ſhould uſe no more, to Remember your Dangers and your Deliverances.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, another Motive is this, to Remember your Dangers with your Deliverances; this will in your great Diſtreſſes and Extremities, contribute ſome Hope to you; to read over your Regiſter, your ancient Records, how good God hath been at ſuch a time, and ſuch a time; how ſeaſonably he ſtept in and Delivered in ſuch a ſtrait and ſuch a ſtrait; Oh then ſays the Soul, why then ſhould I Deſpair, and caſt off all Hope now? Hath not he appeared and ſaved in Deaths often before now? For paſt Experiences are good ſupports for Hope in preſent Exigencies and Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; thus <hi>David</hi> argues, when at a great ſtrait, <hi>Thou haſt delivered me, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0114800200:145"/>wilt deliver me;</hi> and thus St. <hi>Paul, Thou haſt delivered me, and wilt deliver me. Haman</hi> found this a good way to Remember the Years of the Lord's Right Hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember your Dangers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, for God records them; they are filed up by God, and he will mind you of them another Day if you forget them now; he keeps his Journals and Records; he hath his Book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your forgotten Mercies, as well as your forgotten Sins; God will one Day read over all thoſe Deliverances you have forgotten; <hi>Oh poor Soul! Did not I deliver thee in ſuch a Danger, in ſuch a Diſtreſs, in ſuch a Death, when there was no Hope, when there was no Help, yet all this haſt thou forgotten; forgotten'thy Mercy, and forgotten the God of thy Mercy;</hi> Oh! will not this ſting you to the Heart, when God ſhall cauſe your ſtrangled, and murdered Mercies to walk in your Conſciences; when he ſhall give them a Reſurrection there?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Motive to Remember your Dangers and Deliverances: The Vows of God are upon you; Oh! What did you ſay to God in the day of your Diſtreſs and Calamity? <hi>Lord if thou wilt appear, and be a preſent Help in time of Trouble, it ſhall never be for gotten, it ſhall he Remembred
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0114800200:146"/>to the Lord as long as we have a Day to Live</hi> but when God brings poor Souls off many do not only forget their Vows but deny them: In Ancient times it was uſual in imminent Dangers, whether a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Sea or Land to make Vows; We read that <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Mariners, they vowed Vows (<hi>Jonah</hi> 1.16.) <hi>David</hi> did thus, <hi>Thy Vows are upon me, O God! I will render praiſes unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.11. (and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) <hi>I will pay thee my Vows, which my Lips have uttered, and my Mouth hath ſpoken when I was in trouble,</hi> (Pſal. 66.13, 14.) But becauſe this is ſo ordinary to make Vows at Sea, and break them a Shoar, let me enlarge a little upon it. 1. Why ſhould you forget your Vows after your Deliverances? They were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why ſhould you ferget your Vows after Deliverances, for God will require Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0114800200:147"/>Nay, this is not only the Reaſon why we ſhould not forget to pay, but why we ſhould not delay the Pay; <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow to the Lord thy God, thou ſhouldſt not be ſlack to Pay it, for the Lord thy God will require it, yea, will ſurely require it of thee, and it would be Sin in thee,</hi> (Deut. 23.21.) Take it for granted he will do it, ſo as to call to a Payment Day, he will demand it, he will ſend unto you a Summons to Pay the Vows you made to him in the day of your Diſtreſs. Oh! How often is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, God's Officer, that he ſends to you to demand Payment?

Say not before the Angel, <hi>It was an Error, wherefore ſhould God be angry at thy Vows, and deſtroy the works of thy Hands?</hi> (Eccleſ. 5.4, 5.) Some Expoſitors refes this to the Prieſt, before whom the Sin of raſh Vows was to be confeſs'd; others carry it to Chriſt, the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,

               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to forget your Deliverances and Dangers, is the greateſt Ingratitude and Unthankfulneſs in the World; hath God given you ſo many wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, ſo many miraculous Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, to be buried in the Grave of Oblivion? Will you Murder your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and then bury them? It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>Murder will out.</hi> Murdered Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will one day make terrible work, in walking in your Conſciences.</p>
               <p>The next Obſervation is this, That Salvations and Deliverances many times are not ſent until Perſons be left Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Hopeleſs. I ſhall give you a touch of this. <hi>Now all hope of being ſaved was taken away, no ſmall Tempeſt lay upon upon them; now they were gulft in Deſpair of ever coming off with their Lives:</hi> Yet this often is the condition of Nations, Ship-Companies, and Perſons, where God intends to ſave and deliver. The Proofs of the laſt Obſervations about Dangers and Deliverances being record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0114800200:149"/>and remembred, proves this alſo. Thus was <hi>Peter</hi> ſaved, the Diſciples ſaved, when juſt at ſinking.</p>
               <p>But why doth God ſtay ſo long before he ſends Deliverances and Salvations? 1. Becauſe he delights to draw forth a Spirit of Prayer; if Men will not Pray when ſinking, when Drowning, when Dying, they will never Pray. O ſee how <hi>Jonah</hi> Prays in his diſtreſs: <hi>And</hi> Jonah <hi>Prayed to the Lord out of the Fiſhes Belly, and ſaid, I cried by reaſon of mine Affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the Belly of Hell cried I, and thou heardeſt my Voice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When my Soul faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, I remembred the Lord; and my Prayer came in unto thy Holy Temple,</hi> (Jonah 2.1, 2, 3, 7.) O Sirs, God loves Prayer ſo well, that he ſtays with his Deliverances, that he might ſue them out by Prayer. <hi>Out of the Depths have 1 cried unto thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 130. 1.) Driven to it by deep and bottomleſs ſtraits, into which I am plunged. And it ſeems to be an Illuſion to Mariners, in their Diſtreſſes and Dangers of being Shipwrackt, crying unto the Lord. What, will any Man periſh, and never Pray for it? Die, and never Cry for it? What, and not ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Maſter, ſave me, or I periſh?</hi> What was it that did draw
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0114800200:150"/>forth Prayer in many of theſe Diſtreſſed Ship Companies (in this Treatiſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) but their Dangers and Diſtreſſes?</p>
               <p n="2">2. God doth not bring our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Salvations until we be Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, becauſe he will exerciſe his Peoples Graces: Therefore the Diſciples were not ſaved until the Ship was full, that their Graces might be exerciſed. O now is a time for Faith and Patience to be exerted, there is nothing more pleaſing unto God, than to ſee how poor Souls exerciſe their Graces, when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Extremities; God hath a great revenue of Glory ariſing to himſelf, out of the exerciſe of his own Grace in the Souls of Believers. O how doth Faith act its part when Mercy and Deliverance is delay'd! It was one of <hi>Luther</hi>'s won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>to believe for Mercy that was long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd.</hi> It is an high exerciſe of Faith, to look up to God long together, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to come. To ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jonah, I will look again towards thy Holy Temple,</hi> (Jonah 2.4, 8.) And with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Tho' he hide his Face from the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>I will wait upon him, and look for him,</hi> (Iſaiah 17.) What tho' thou be as the Prophet's Servant, who went down to the Sea to look, and he ſaid <hi>Maſter, there is nothing.</hi> But what
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0114800200:151"/>then? Doth he give over? O no, <hi>the looks again;</hi> and <hi>the ſeventh look he ſaw he Cloud.</hi> So Faith in its exerciſe, will look again and again, and never give over, until it eſpie the Mercy coming upon the wings of Prayer. So might I add of Patience; O how doth it act its part while the Deliverance tarries; it quietly waits for the Salvation of God; ſaying, as <hi>David, My Soul waits for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning,</hi> (Pſal. 130.6.) The Soul of the Believer poſſeſſes it ſelf in Patience until the Mercy come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God doth not bring our Salvations and Deliverances, until we be brought to an Extremity; becauſe they are moſt prized and welcomed then. O now Deliverance will be prized: The longer that a Mercy tarries, the more welcome it is when it comes: God loves to make all his Mercies welcome to us. O how welcome is Life, to a Perſon under a Sentence of Death! O how welcome is a Diſcovery of the love of Chriſt to a poor Soul, that hath long groaned under the burthen of unpardon'd Guilt! O how welcome was the Prodigal's Father's Houſe, when he had ſo long been ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Fields, with his Husks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Swine!</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0114800200:152"/>4. Becauſe God will have all his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Deliverances look like his own Hand and Arm, his Arm brings Salvation with him; he will have the print of his own Hand upon it, that poor Sinners may ſay, <hi>This is the Finger of God, the doing of God, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</hi> Alas, Men would attribute it to themſelves, if Salvation did not come in ſuch a way, <hi>when all hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saved is taken away.</hi> Oh! Every thing is beautiful in its Seaſon; is not Salvation and Deliverance now in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Now they begin to Deſpair, as to probable or viſible hopes. O now, God works like himſelf, now he appears in a Deliverance to be God; which ſet the Diſciples a wondering, <hi>What manner of Man is this, that the Winds and the Sea obey him?</hi> Mark 4.41. And at another time, when he deliver'd his Diſciples at Sea, and calmed the Winds, then they that were in the Ship Worſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>Of a truth thou art the Son of God,</hi> 14.32, 33.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe he will by ſuch Salvations ſet off his Love to poor Souls: Was not the Love of Chriſt ſet off highly, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Seaſon to ſave the Ship <hi>when it was full; to ſave them when they were ſinking;</hi> is not that great Love, that ſteps
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0114800200:153"/>forth to ſave in an Extremity? O what Love was this, to ſave this Ships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>when all hope of being ſaved was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away?</hi> Love always chuſes the fitteſt times to appear and evidence it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Becauſe he will have his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, endearing Deliverances to Souls. O how doth ſuch an appearance of God, at ſuch a time, endear the Soul of the Receiver. Therefore, ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I will love the Lord,</hi> (or love the Lord dearly) <hi>my Rock, and my Deliverer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I will proceed to give you alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of the <hi>Application,</hi> and not to be large, becauſe I have been large upon the former, which was mainly intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then learn we hence, that God may for gracious ends, known to himſelf, delay a Mercy or a Deliverance, and yet fully intend to give in that Mercy. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob may wreſtle all Night, and yet be put off; but in the break of Day the Mercy comes.</hi> The Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> may cry to Chriſt for her Daughter, and at preſent be put off, yet at laſt ſhe ſhall carry it. The belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul may not have the <hi>Dove</hi> come with an <hi>Olive-Branch</hi> in her Mouth until Evening. Chriſt's manifeſting of his Love to poor Souls, is called his Supping with them; <hi>And I will Sup with you:</hi> Now Supper comes not up till Evening.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0114800200:154"/>2. Learn we hence, that God's timing our Deliverances and Salvations, is beſt for us; his Time is the beſt Time. Our time is always ready, (but ſaith Chriſt) <hi>My time is not yet.</hi> If we had our Mercies in our time, we ſhould not ſee that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them; for every thing is beautiful in its Seaſon: And God chuſes the fitteſt Seaſons to ſend them, becauſe he will put a beauty upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learn we hence, <hi>that no caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate to God, tho' it be ſo to Man:</hi> One would have thought this a deſperate caſe, <hi>in ſuch a Storm, lightning the Ship,</hi> the <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut of the Tackling of the Ship, neither Sun nor Stars appeared, and all hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved taken away;</hi> yet all this was but deſperate to them, it was not ſo to God: Now their Extremity becomes God's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and he takes this Juncture of time to appear in. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42. 7, 8. all God's <hi>Waves and</hi> God's <hi>Billows had gone over him;</hi> a deſperate caſe! Yet God (then he believes) <hi>would command his loving kindneſs in the Day-time, and the Song ſhould be with him in the Night.</hi> Faith is an excellent Grace at a deſperate ſtand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Learn we hence, that <hi>God's Thoughts are not as our thoughts;</hi> when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> think of nothing but ſinking and periſhing, then doth God think of Saving and Delivering.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0114800200:155"/>They thought <hi>all hope of being ſaved was taken away,</hi> but God looks through the Storm and Cloud, and Comforts them. As the Diſciples, when they thought it had been a Spirit in their Storm that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them; <hi>No,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>be not afraid; be of good chear, it is I,</hi> Mark 6. 50, 51, 52.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Is it ſo, that the Salvations and Deliverances that many of us have, are not until we are brought to Extremities? Then it is a word of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> Then look up to God in the moſt deſperate Caſe, when you know not what to do in your Storms at Sea, in your Straits at Land. O then let your Eyes be up unto the Lord; you ſee how many Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances have come down in Extremities, as anſwers to Prayer. O Pray hard; let going to Sea, being in Storms at Sea, being brought to Extremities at Sea, learn you to Pray.</p>

               <p>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed; let the redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo; whom he hath delivered from the mercileſs rage of the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Lord is gracious and full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: flow to anger, and of great mercy.</p>
               <p>He hath not dealt with us according to our ſins: neither rewarded us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our iniquitirs.</p>
               <p>But as the Heaven his above the Earth: ſo great hath been his mercy towards us.</p>
               <p>We found trouble and heavineſs: we were even at deaths door;</p>
               <p>The Waters of the Sea had well nigh cover'd us: the proud waters had nigh gone over our ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Sea roared and the ſtormy wind lifted the waves thereof;</p>
               <p>We were carried up, as it were to Heaven, and went down again into the deep: our ſoul melted within us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of trouble;</p>
               <p>Then cried we unto the Lord: and
<pb facs="tcp:0114800200:167"/>thou didſt deliver us out of our diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be thy name, who didſt not deſpiſe the prayer of thy ſervants; but didſt hear our cry, and haſt ſaved us.</p>
               <p>Thou didſt ſend forth thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the windy ſtorm ceaſed, and was turned into a calm.</p>
               <p>O let us therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs: and declare the wonders that he hath done, and ſtill doeth for the children of men.</p>
               <p>Praiſed be the Lord daily; even the Lord that helped us, and poured his benefits upon us.</p>
               <p>He is our God, even the God of whom cometh ſalvation; God is the Lord by whom we eſcaped death.</p>
               <p>Thou Lord haſt made us glad through the operation of thy hands; and we will triumph in thy praiſe.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be the Lord God; even the Lord God who only doeth wondrous things.</p>
               <p>And bleſſed be the name of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> for ever; and let every one of us ſay, Amen, Amen.</p>
               <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son; and to the holy Ghoſt;</p>
               <p>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever ſhall be; world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>A Prayer to be ſaid before a Fight at Sea againſt any Enemy.</head>
               <p>O Moſt powerful and glorious Lord God, the Lord of hoſts, that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and commandeſt all things; Thou ſitteſt in the throne judging right: and therefore we make our addreſs to thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty in this our neceſſity, that thou wouldſt take the cauſe into thy own hand, and judge between us and our enemies. Stir up thy ſtrength, O Lord, and come and help us; for thou giveſt not always the battel to the ſtrong, but canſt ſave by many or by few, O let not our ſins now cry againſt us for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but hear us thy poor ſervants beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy and imploring thy help, and that thou wouldſt be a defence unto us againſt the face of the enemy. Make it appear that thou art our Saviour and mighty deliverer, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
