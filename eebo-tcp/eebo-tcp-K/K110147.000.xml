            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' Abundance of ſolid Particulars are naturally ſunk in the rapid Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Time, while many leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial are floating upon the Surface, to the Hand of every ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialiſt: And though ſome ſhining Circumſtances, in the proſperous Part of Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi>'s Life, have been darkened through Envy; as others, in the unfortunate Period, through Intereſt, by the Age in which he lived; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, his ſingle Life may perhaps be found more fruitful of memorable Incidents, than many Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of intire Ages: Inſomuch, as I may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, with a late Collector of his Memoirs, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the deſcribing a Perſon of ſo diffuſive a Praiſe, ſo equally great in ſo many different Parts of Life, will be like attempting a Landſkip from a high Hill, where the Multiplicity and Extent of the Proſpects may rather diſtract the Mind,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0181500200:5"/>
than direct it; and call for Judgment to reſtrain the Fancy, which is apt to run Riot, when employed upon too many Objects."</q> Many Guides may indeed appear to lead us through this Wilderneſs; but, numerous as the Authors are who mention him, they contain but Fragments of his Story; divers whereof, hitherto widely diſperſed, have eſcaped not only our general Hiſtorians, but the many Compilers of diſtinct Pieces on his Actions. Even the Moderns, who have treated of him with Impartiality, have yet been deficient in point of Induſtry, ſo as to prove no leſs injurious to his Merits, than ſome, who in his own Age conſpired to depreciate them. Hence the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, having been too ſuperficial and undigeſted; having neither regarded due Choice and Order of Matter, Proportion in the Parts, or Connexion of the whole; nor yet diſcharged themſelves by ſuch References to proper Vouchers, as might ſatisfy thoſe Readers it is my Ambition to pleaſe; I have eſteemed the Number of ſuch Writers, no Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Revival of his Story.</p>
            <p>And firſt for the Name of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> otherwiſe written <hi>Rale</hi> and <hi>Ralega,</hi> in ſome old Deeds I have formerly ſeen; it is certainly of great Antiquity in this Kingdom; ſince there are ſome Villages and Towns in the Weſt, as well as other Parts, ſo called, which might at firſt receive their Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from ſome, as well as afterwards give it to others, who were Natives or Poſſeſſors thereof, And ſince we are credibly informed, that one of thoſe Diſtricts belonged antiently to noble Lords of the ſame Name, as alſo that ſeveral of them were ſo called from the very Family we are to ſpeak of: And as the <hi>Raleghs</hi> of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> will appear to have flouriſhed there before the Conqueſt; they might be the Progenitors of thoſe in other Countries; as it is expreſly intimated out of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0181500200:6"/>
Records they were of thoſe in <hi>Warwickſhire.</hi> But as we are alſo told of no leſs than five Knights of this Name, at one Time differently ſituated in that Weſtern County before mentioned; and that there were three great Families ſo named alſo there, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s, who bore Arms different from thoſe of his paternal Coat; we may conclude, they were not all of one Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage; and at the ſame Time, that it is owing to the Eminency of this great Man, that a Diſtinction of the ſeveral Houſes, and his in particular, when all but his were in a Manner extinct, has been ſo elaborately endeavoured by the Antiquaries and Genealogiſts of his own Time.</p>
            <p>As to the Family of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> therefore in particular, it is generally agreed on, that <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Axminſter,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> was one of their moſt ancient Seats. But Sir <hi>William Pole,</hi> who is ſaid to have been one of the greateſt Searchers into the Antiquities of that Country, has been ſingularly ſhort in the Time of their firſt ſettling there. However, if we ſhould agree with him upon that Perſon for Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s direct Anceſtor, who firſt removed thither out of <hi>Nettlecomb-Ralegh</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. from whom there is a ſucceſſive Deſcent of thoſe ſix Knights, Sir <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>

One of theſe Sarcaſms I find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his little Book of <hi>Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms,</hi> where he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That when Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> had advanced <hi>Ralegh,</hi> ſhe was one Day playing on the Virginals, and my Lord of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> with another Nobleman ſtood by; when it happen'd that the Ledge before the Jacks was taken away, ſo that they were ſeen; whereupon that Lord and the other Nobleman ſmil'd and whiſper'd a little; the Queen mark'd it, and would needs know, <hi>what was the Matter?</hi> His Lordſhip anſwer'd, <hi>They laugh'd to ſee, that when</hi> Jacks <hi>went up,</hi> Heads <hi>went down.</hi>"</q> Tho' the Application of this Reflection particularly to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> if ſuch was made, is diſputable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0181500200:10"/>
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Alluſion, yet it is plain, that Sir <hi>Robert Naunton,</hi> who was Secretary of State at the Time of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death, and whoſe <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on that Queen's <hi>Favourites</hi> were written, though not printed, before thoſe <hi>Apophthegms,</hi> thought alſo, that it was made upon <hi>Ralegh;</hi> for he has ſaid, with Relation to this Jeſt by that witty Earl, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"We all know it ſavours more of Emulation and his Humour, than of Truth; it being a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Note of the Times, that the Queen, in her Choice, never took into her Favour a mere new Man, or a Mechanick."</q> But it is believ'd, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> himſelf was afterwards pretty even with his <hi>Quality-critics;</hi> where he ſo ſolidly expoſes the Emptineſs of Merit, nay, the real Detriment to it, in Poſterity's being entitled to the Rewards of their Anceſtor's Virtues, by <hi>hereditary</hi> Honours, Succeſſion of <hi>Blood,</hi> and Nobility in <hi>Parchment; thoſe only being truly</hi> noble, <hi>who by worthy Acts have render'd themſelves most</hi> notable.</p>
            <p>All therefore that needs be added on this Head, as a Matter more immediately requiſite, and indeed ſufficient for my preſent Purpoſe, is, That Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi> was the Son of <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> Eſq; of <hi>Fardel</hi> aforeſaid; who being thrice married, had by his firſt Wife <hi>Joan,</hi> Daughter of <hi>John Drake</hi> of <hi>Exmouth</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> Eſq; two Sons, one named <hi>George,</hi> and the other <hi>John;</hi> which laſt married <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>Bartholomew Forteſcue</hi> of <hi>Filley</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> and Relict of—<hi>Gaicrick</hi> of <hi>Ford;</hi> and they had Iſſue. His ſecond Wife was Daughter of one <hi>Darell</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> by whom he had a Daughter named <hi>Mary,</hi> who was married to <hi>Hugh Snedale</hi> of <hi>Hilling</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Eſq; and had Iſſue: His third Wife was <hi>Catherine</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Philip Champernon</hi> of <hi>Modbury,</hi> and Relict of <hi>Otho Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Compton</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> Eſq; He had by this laſt <hi>Venter,</hi> his third Son, <hi>Carew,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0181500200:11"/>
knighted, and of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> who married <hi>Dorothy</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>William Wroughton,</hi> and Relict of Sir <hi>John Tbynn;</hi> by whom he had Iſſue; and laſtly, his fourth Son, named <hi>Walter,</hi> the Subject of our enſuing Diſcourſe; who was thereby the <hi>uterine</hi> Brother of thoſe three eminent Knights, Sir <hi>John,</hi> Sir <hi>Humphry,</hi> and Sir <hi>Adrian Gilbert.</hi> By this laſt Wife, Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> had alſo one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, named <hi>Margaret;</hi> who was married firſt to—<hi>Radford</hi> of <hi>Mount Radford</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> Clerk of the Peace; and afterwards to—<hi>Hull</hi> of <hi>Larkebre,</hi> Eſq; in St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s Pariſh, <hi>Exeter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Family was indeed at this Time much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd from its former Splendor of Fame and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Fortune; for the Eſtate of <hi>Smalridge,</hi> which remain'd in the Name of <hi>Ralegh</hi> to the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was then ſold, by Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Grandfather <hi>Wimond,</hi> to <hi>John</hi> the Father of Sir <hi>John Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Compton;</hi> but I cannot find it reduc'd to that low Ebb, in the latter Reſpect, which ſome have intimated; for <hi>Fardel</hi> remained ſtill in their Poſſeſſion, which, after the Death of Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Father, ſell to the eldeſt Son <hi>George;</hi> and there were beſides <hi>Widdycomb Ralegh,</hi> and <hi>Coliton-Ralegh</hi> in their Poſſeſſion; the former of which was ſold, by Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s elder Brother Sir <hi>Carew Ralegh,</hi> to <hi>George</hi> the natural Son of <hi>George</hi> aforeſaid; and the latter was ſold, by Sir <hi>Walter</hi> himſelf, to <hi>Richard Martin,</hi> or his Father, of <hi>Exeter.</hi> But neither of theſe Places claim the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Birth.</p>
            <p>For his Father having the Remainder of a four-ſcore-years Leaſe, in a pleaſant Farm call'd <hi>Hayes,</hi> ſituate in the Pariſh of <hi>Budley,</hi> in that Part of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire</hi> bordering Eaſtward upon the Sea, near where the <hi>Ottery,</hi> or River of <hi>Otters,</hi> diſcharges it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Channel; and reſiding upon the ſaid Farm during the Time of his laſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0181500200:12"/>
this was the Birth-place of Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh;</hi> and it is accordingly diſtinguiſh'd, as for nothing more remarkable, by topographical Writers to this Day. After the Expiration of that Leaſe, <hi>Ralegh</hi> apply'd, but unſucceſsfully, to Mr. <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Otterton,</hi> to whom the Eſtate devolv'd, to fell it him; as appears by <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Letter to him, wherein he ſays, <hi>That for the natural Diſpoſition he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ad to the Place, being born in that Houſe, he had rather ſeat himſelf there, than any where elſe.</hi> From whence, it ſeems, that what ſome are, by another <hi>Devonian</hi> Antiquary, ſaid to have reported, and himſelf appears only to have recorded; as if <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>was born in the City of</hi> Exeter, <hi>and in the Houſe adjoining to the Palace-Gate;</hi> has no Authority, and perhaps, had not ſo much as Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to countenance it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Time of his Birth; I find the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation has been made from</hi> Camden<hi>'s Account of his Age at his Death, that he was born in the Year 1552. And herewith correſponds an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation I have found in an aſtrological Author, who, fixing his Birth in the ſixth Year of King</hi> Edward <hi>VI. which anſwers to the Year of our Lord aforeſaid, calls it,</hi> A Year remarkable in our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles; firſt, for that ſtrange Shole of the largeſt Sea-fiſhes, which, quitting their native Waters for freſh and untaſted Streams, wandered up the <hi>Thames</hi> ſo high, till the River no longer retained any Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhneſs; and ſecondly, for that it is thought to have been ſomewhat ſtained in our Annals with the Blood of the noble <hi>Seymer,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet:</hi> Events (ſays he) ſurpriſingly analogous both to the Life of this adventurous Voyager, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> whoſe Delight was in the hazardous Diſcovery of unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Coaſts; and alſo to his unfortunate Death.</p>
            <p>That his younger Years were ſeaſoned at the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> we may gather from good
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0181500200:13"/>
Authorities; as <hi>Hooker</hi> aforeſaid, Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Wood;</hi> which laſt ſays, <hi>He became Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner of</hi> Oriel College, <hi>in or about the Year</hi> 1568, <hi>when his Kinſman</hi> C. Champernon <hi>ſtudied there; and that his natural Parts being ſtrangely advanced by academical Learning, under the Care of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tutor; he became the Ornament of the Juniors; and was worthily eſteem'd a Proficient in Oratory and Philoſophy.</hi> But in that he came ſo late thither as this Author mentions, and ſtayed ſo long there as three Years, is a Miſtake; for he will preſently appear two Years before that Time amounts to, in the Wars abroad. What Time then can we ſpare for his Reſidence at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> College alſo, in that Univerſity; whereof Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> would needs have him a Member, either before or after he was of <hi>Oriel;</hi> unleſs we could find, as I fear we ſhall not, that he return'd from the School of <hi>Mars,</hi> to that of the <hi>Muſes?</hi> Little more can we expect to have been obſerved of this remote Part of his Life; and yet ſomething more in it has been preſerved by Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> aforeſaid, who had the Judgment to foreſee, that every little Circumſtance would be acceptable of a Man, whoſe Fortunes and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes had render'd him ſo memorable. And indeed it has been repreſented to me as a Matter of no ſmall Honour to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> that a caſual Expreſſion of his, in his immature and greeneſt Years, ſhould prefer it ſelf to the Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of that great Philoſopher, in his ſageſt and moſt advanced Age. But as he had obſerved, on the Nature of Things, that great Objects may be diſcern'd through a little Crevice; ſo he knew, with Reſpect to the Nature of Men, that a great Diſcovery of Genius may be made through a ſmall and ſudden Repartee; and hence might he be moved to remember; <hi>That while</hi> Ralegh <hi>was a Scholar at</hi> Oxford, <hi>there was a cowardly Fellow,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0181500200:14"/>
               <hi>who happened to be a very good Archer; but having been groſly abuſed by another, he bemoaned himſelf to</hi> Ralegh, <hi>and aſk'd his Advice;</hi> What he ſhould do to repair the Wrong that had been offer'd him? Ralegh <hi>anſwer'd,</hi> Why, challenge him—at a Match of Shooting.</p>
            <p>How long he continued at the Univerſity, is at laſt rightly concluded by <hi>Anthony Wood</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but as ſure as he thinks himſelf right in ſettling him a Student of the Municipal Laws in the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> upon ſeeing a Copy of Verſes he might write in that Inn of Conrt; I take this Aſſertion to be a greater Uncertainty than the other. For though Sir <hi>Robert Naunton,</hi> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly from him moſt other Writers of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Life, have alſo conſign'd him to the Study of the Law, on his leaving <hi>Oxford;</hi> there is a late Author who believes it a Miſtake ſo obvious, that no Merit can reaſonably be aſſum'd from correcting it; for Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> at his Arraignment, in a Reply to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-general, lays a heavy Imprecation upon himſelf, <hi>If ever he read a Word of Law or Statutes, before he was a Priſoner in the Tower.</hi> So that if this <hi>Ralegh</hi> was the Author of that Poem before mentioned, and of the <hi>Middle-Temple</hi> in that Year it was written, which we ſhall preſently arrive at, we muſt yet take Care to keep the <hi>Lawyer</hi> clear from the <hi>Templar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For we are expreſly told by <hi>Hooker, That after</hi> Ralegh <hi>had laid a good Ground to build his Actions on at the Univerſity, he travell'd into</hi> France; and this is confirm'd by <hi>Camden,</hi> according to whoſe Account of the Time, <hi>Ralegh</hi> could not be, at his Departure, above ſeventeen Years of Age; and by the Occaſion of his firſt going over, it will appear that a military Courſe of Life firſt fledg'd his Fame. For as it has been rightly obſerv'd, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0181500200:15"/>
had the Advantage of a ſtirring Age to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and exerciſe his active Genius, throughout the whole Series of his firſt Engagements. <hi>France</hi> was now embroil'd in Civil Wars; <hi>England</hi> ſoon after, to divert a menaced Danger from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> lent Aſſiſtance to the then diſtreſs'd and humble States of <hi>Holland; Spain,</hi> by a political Repriſal, raiſed ſtubborn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> to make the Rebellion more permanent, and more plauſible, religiouſly pretended that Kingdom was a Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt of <hi>France;</hi> and here we need not recur to the Original of thoſe Commotions there; need not trace the <hi>Hugonots</hi> to their Fountain-head; apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſe for their Oppoſitions againſt the <hi>Guiſards,</hi> labour to reconcile Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Defence of another Prince's oppreſſed Subjects, to the Laws of Nations, when imminent Danger, by ſuch Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, threatned her own; nor, laſtly, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate her Motives againſt <hi>France</hi> in particular, from their late Violation of Covenants, relating to the Rendition of <hi>Calais;</hi> theſe Topics being to be ſought where they have already been, and it is more proper they ſhould be directly diſcuſſed. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient therefore it will be, to obſerve in this Place, out of <hi>Camden</hi>'s Annals, that though the Queen had her Hand full of Diſorders at home, yet ſhe was not wanting either in Commiſeration or Relief to the perſecuted Proteſtants of <hi>France;</hi> and not only exhorted other Princes of the ſame Perſuaſion to lend their Hands to the common Cauſe, but ſupply'd the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> with Money and Men to ſupport it; permitting <hi>Henry Champernon,</hi> a Relation by Marriage of the Earl of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> to match with a ſelect Troop of a Hundred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Volunteers, well mounted and accoutred, into
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0181500200:16"/>
               <hi>France;</hi> who bore in their Standard this Motto: FINEM DET MIHI VIRTUS: <hi>Let Valour decide the Cauſe.</hi> In the Liſt of theſe Volunteers, was <hi>Philip Butſhed,</hi> with <hi>Francis Barcley,</hi> Men after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Note in their Time; and this <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> the moſt noted of all, then a very young Man, and firſt beginning to puſh his Fortune in the World; <hi>admodum adoleſcens, jam primum ſatis monſtratus,</hi> ſays our above-cited Annaliſt.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Hiſtorian in <hi>France</hi> of thoſe Times, tells us, this ſelect Troop of Horſe arrived in the <hi>French</hi> Camp, on the 5th of <hi>October</hi> 1569, and that they were very honourably received by the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Princes. But what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices diſtinctly they performed in <hi>France,</hi> or how long they continued there, neither the Writers of that Country, nor of our own, have, I think, given full Satisfaction. This Conſequence we draw from ſome Circumſtances in the latter Part of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Life, that he eſtabliſhed himſelf a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reputation while he was in that Kingdom; and from <hi>Hooker, That he ſpent good Part of his Youth in Wars and martial Services there:</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to which, is that Paſſage in another Author, who alſo ſeems to have known him; where, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Education, he adds, <hi>It was not Part, but wholly Gentleman, wholly Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians tell us, that what with the Supplies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who ſent the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants a hundred thouſand Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome Pieces of Cannon and Ammunition; and what with the Aids of their other Allies, the Proteſtant Army, which took the Field under Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Coligny</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>Limoſin,</hi> this Year of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s going over, being in the Beginning of their third civil War, amounted to no leſs than 25000 fighting Men;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0181500200:17"/>
when the King's Army under his Brother the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> being encamped at <hi>Rochlabeille,</hi> amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to above 30,000. But others reckon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Army of equal Number; and obſerve, tho' their Men and Horſe died at <hi>Limoſin</hi> in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for Want of Food and Forage; and though a great Reward was offered for the Admiral, dead or alive, that it only added Fuel to the Fire: For what Terror could it ſtrike, ſays my Author, into Perſons, who headed an Army of 30,000 Men, and ventured their Lives with the utmoſt Bravery on all Occaſions? As for the inſincere League or Union of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> by the pretended Marriage, which appears to have been negotiated two Years after between the two Crowns; it ſeems not to have withdrawn theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Auxiliaries, at leaſt not him along with them; becauſe <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Continuance in <hi>France</hi> would then fall ſhort of <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Implication aforeſaid. But as we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him to have been in that Kingdom beyond the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. which from <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Entrance thither is about five Years; and that in this Compaſs of Time near 30 Battles, Sieges, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws, Treaties and Capitulations on one Side or other may be enumerated; it is manifeſt that our young Volunteer was hazardouſly engaged in ſome, if not ſeveral of them. He had afterwards Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mention, upon his obſerving here, the ill Conſequence of having Commanders in equal Power, whom it is almoſt impoſſible to chuſe of equal Courage and Diſcretion. In another Place <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſpeaks of a Stratagem which he and his Company uſed with Succeſs at <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where the Enemy had fortified themſelves in certain Caves which had but one narrow Entrance cut in the Mid-way of the high Rocks, and <hi>which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we knew not how to enter by any Ladder or Engine;</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0181500200:18"/>
               <hi>'till at laſt, by certain Bundles of lighted Straw let down by an Iron Chain with a weighty Stone in the midſt, thoſe that defended it were ſo ſmothered, that they ſurrendered themſelves, with their Plate, Money, and other Goods, therein hidden; or they muſt have died like Bees that are ſmoaked out of their Hives."</hi> And in another Place he gratefully takes Notice of a Deliverance he had in theſe Wars. 'Tis where, reaſoning upon the Manner and Opportunities of Retreats in Battle, he firſt gives an Example of its being leſs Diſhonour to retire in the Dark, than to be ruined in the Light, in the Sentiment of M. <hi>de la Noue,</hi> upon the Retreat made juſt before the Battle of <hi>Moncountour. For,</hi> ſays that <hi>Frenchman, ſtaying upon our Reputation in Shew, not to diſlodge by Night; we loſt our Reputation indeed, in diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Day; whereby we were forced to fight upon our Diſadvantage, and to our Ruin: Yet (ſays</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh) <hi>did that worthy Gentleman Count</hi> Lodowick <hi>of</hi> Naſſau, <hi>Brother to the late famous Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>make the Retreat at</hi> Moncountour <hi>with ſo great Reſolution, as he ſaved one half of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Army, then broken and diſbanded, of which my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was an Eye-witneſs, and was one of them who had Cauſe to thank him for it.</hi> But by what Means <hi>Ralegh</hi> eſcaped that comprehenſive Deſtruction which broke out in the third Year of this turbulent Period, unleſs with young <hi>Sidney</hi> (afterwards a Knight of great Renown for his own Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Patronage of other Men's, then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Travels in <hi>France)</hi> he took Sanctuary in the Ambaſſador <hi>Walſingham</hi>'s Houſe, <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Digges</hi>'s compleat Ambaſſador, Fol. 250.</note>we deſpair, at this Diſtance, of learning: For then the cruel and inſidious young King aforeſaid, inflamed by the Queen-Mother, and her Firebrands of Religion,

met with, in an eminent Author of his own Time. For Mr. <hi>Richard Hackluyt,</hi> in his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Collection of Voyages, dedicating his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of a <hi>French</hi> Adventure therein to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> tells him, That <hi>calling to Mind you had ſpent more Years in</hi> France <hi>than I, and underſtand the</hi> French <hi>better than myſelf; I perceived you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my Endeavour, not for any private Eaſe, but for the ſpecial Care you had of thoſe to be employed in your own like Enterpriſe.</hi> And how long <hi>Hakluyt</hi> had been in <hi>France,</hi> appears in his Dedication to Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> of his firſt Edition of thoſe Voyages; where he takes the Occaſion to tell his Patrons, that himſelf had been five Years in that Kingdom: So that <hi>Raleigh</hi> muſt have been at leaſt ſix Years there.</p>
            <p>And this will lead us near the Time we are to look for him in <hi>London,</hi> if we take for our Guide in the Chronology of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Life, that Copy of Verſes before-mentioned which <hi>Anthony Wood</hi> took for his, in Relation to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Profeſſion. Theſe Verſes I have found to be a commendatory Poem of three Stanza's, by <hi>Walter Rawely</hi> of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> as he is there written; and printed among others, before a Satire called <hi>The Steel Glaſs,</hi> publiſhed in 1576, by a learned and ingenious Poet of Repute in thoſe Days, named <hi>George Gaſcoigne,</hi> Eſq;</p>
            <p>Now, though I have had the Opportunity of ſeeing ſome original Manuſcripts of Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Writing, and his Name written ſeveral Times by his own Hand, I ſhall not cavil at the Pſeudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy thereof before the ſaid printed Copy of Verſes; becauſe I could inſtance greater Errors of the like Nature, which yet have not excluded Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from the Reputation of their Compoſitions;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0181500200:22"/>
but more eſpecially, becauſe there are ſome glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Circumſtances which render the Writing of that Piece by this our Author probable to me; as namely, a Kind of familiar Dependency which that <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> had upon the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton;</hi> as in the Dedication of this, and ſome other of his Works, is evident; under which Nobleman <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> will ſoon after appear to have ſerved in the Wars of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Again, <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> had led a Life ſomewhat like <hi>Ralegh</hi> in foreign Travel and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Services: Then 'tis to be noted <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> uſed the very Motto, under his Picture prefixed to that Satyr before-mentioned; which after his Death is ſo well known to have been aſſumed by, or appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to, <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf; <hi>Tam Martii, quam Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curio.</hi> All which ſeem to ſhadow out the Links, if not the perfect Chain, of ſome Acquaintance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. But the Poem itſelf, to me, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in the very firſt Line of it, a great Air of that ſolid axiomatical Vein, which is obſervable in other Productions of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Muſe:
<q>
                  <l>Sweet were the Sauce would pleaſe each Kind of Taſte.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And the whole middle of <hi>Hexaſtic,</hi> is ſuch an Indication of his own Fortune or Fate; ſuch a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt that Envy of ſuperior Merit which he himſelf ever ſtruggled with; that it could proceed from no Hand more properly than his own.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Though ſundry Minds in ſundry Sort do deem;</l>
               <l>Yet worthieſt Wights yield Praiſe to every Pain:</l>
               <l>But envious Brains do nought, or Light eſteem,</l>
               <l>Such ſtately Steps as they cannot attain:</l>
               <l>For whoſo reaps <hi>Renown</hi> above the Reſt,</l>
               <l>With Heaps of <hi>Hate</hi> ſhall ſurely be oppreſs'd.</l>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to the Particular of his Being at this Time of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> all we can conclude of it is, ſince he has ſo publickly and ſolemnly proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he never ſtudied the Law there; that it might be as cuſtomary in the Inns of Court then, as it is now, for a young Gentleman to be with a Friend, or have the Uſe of his Chambers while he is out of Town, or even have Chambers of his own, rather than be confined to the Singularities of a Family in Lodgings, and never read a Word of the Law; much leſs have any Purpoſe to practiſe it.</p>
            <p>His next Stage of Action was in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> according to one of the Writers of his Life; who tells us he ſerved under the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as a Volunteer againſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> making himſelf, in the Low-Countries, Maſter of the Art Military; and confirming, through the Succeſs of his firſt Campaigns, his Reſolution to advance himſelf by Arms, as the nobler and readier Way to Glory. Sir <hi>Robert Naunton</hi> alſo intimates, that before he was in <hi>Ireland</hi> under the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the <hi>Law Countries,</hi> and alſo in a Voyage at Sea. Another Author likewiſe agrees in this <hi>Low Countries</hi> Service, and Voyage at Sea, before <hi>Ralegh</hi> was known at Court. But whereas the firſt of theſe two Writers mentions an earlier Expedition of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before this of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> as his firſt Expoſure to a military Life, being ignorant of all the Time he paſſed in the <hi>French</hi> Wars; and whereas the laſt fixes him in that firſt <hi>Iriſh</hi> Expedition, under General <hi>Norris;</hi> I apprehend them to be herein both miſtaken; the former, in that <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears not to have been twice againſt the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor once at his firſt Engagement in War; and the latter, in that this <hi>Norris</hi> appears not to be in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the Courſe of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Employments will allow him to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0181500200:24"/>
have been in that Kingdom: But now that there is Room for <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s being in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> we find General <hi>Norris</hi> to be there.</p>
            <p>For the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> natural Son <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a briſk, forward young Man, fluſh'd with the late victorious Battle of <hi>Lepanto</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and high in the Pope's Favour; being ſent by his Brother the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Year 1577 Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to divert his Mind from higher Reaches at home; and having incurr'd the general Odium of the States for his Tyranny over them, no leſs than the Jealouſy of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for his Treachery to this Nation; Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> thought the <hi>Dutch</hi> now more immediately needful of her Notice; and more particularly from a Diſcovery that had been made to her, ſome ſay, by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> of a vain Project the ſaid <hi>Don John</hi> had form'd of reſcuing the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> out of Priſon; and by Marriage with her, or the Force of Arms, to dethrone the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of her Crown; ſor <hi>Don John</hi>'s <hi>haughty Conceit of himſelf,</hi> ſays Ralegh, <hi>overcame the greateſt Difficulties, tho' his Judgment was over-weak to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the leaſt.</hi> Wherefore the Queen not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from that Peace with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and Neutrality then in Agitation; but ſent the States both Men and Money, as they had requeſted, to carry on the War more powerfully againſt them. Among the Forces, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> which now poured over, under Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> Colonel <hi>John North, Henry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh,</hi> and others, not to forget Colonel <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> whoſe veteran Troops were the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Harquebuſiers of our Nation, and the firſt who taught us to like the Muſket; there is here, and here only, I think, a Vacancy in the Story of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> that will admit of him under the firſt of thoſe

Commanders; ſo might he probably ſhare in the Danger and Honour of that memorable <hi>Lammas</hi> Day, <hi>Anno</hi> 1578, which buried the Reputation of <hi>Don John;</hi> which this Governor did not two Months ſurvive; and which has raiſed the Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pencils, as well as Pens, to commemorate. For the States having thus gather'd a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and planted themſelves near the Village of <hi>Rimenant,</hi> about a League from <hi>Mecklin; Don John,</hi> at the Head of, ſome ſay thirty thouſand Men, being aſſiſted by the Prince of <hi>Parma, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon,</hi> and other the beſt Commanders of <hi>Spain,</hi> now reſolved to give them Battle. He made a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Onſet; but in the End, by a notable Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, was deluded to a great Overthrow. For perceiving, as he thought, the whole Confederate Army encamped before the ſaid Village, in an open and inviting Plain; <hi>Don John</hi> precipitouſly detach'd a ſtronger Force to encounter them; which ſo ſucceeded on both Sides, that the States Army, after a convenient Reſiſtance, feigning a Flight, quitted this their Counterfeit Camp; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> eagerly purſuing, in a ſcattered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Manner, to compleat their ſuppoſed Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; till, amaz'd, they found themſelves in the Midſt of the Fugitives true Camp, environ'd with nineteen thouſand Horſe and Foot; a Number conſiderably greater than the Aſſailants. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves was impoſſible; there was a River on one Side; when they attempted the Thicket on the other, it was lined with an armed Ambuſcade of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> and when they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the Trenches, they could not ſuſtain the Fury of the Artillery. Yet was the Battle vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly maintained from Morning till Night; tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> harraſs'd by a long and weariſome March, came but a Day, ſome ſay but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0181500200:26"/>
an Hour, to the Field, before the Encounter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; and yet partly thro' Bravery, partly thro' the ſultry Warmth of the Weather; or, as one Author has it, more ſenſible of a little Heat of the Sun, than any cold Fears of Death, they made themſelves further remarkable, by ſtripping off Armour and Cloaths, and fighting in their Shirts; till at laſt, thoſe who had purſued the States Army in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Flight, were themſelves driven, with great Slaughter, to a real one.</p>
            <p>Soon after his Brother Sir <hi>Humphry Gilbert,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now newly obtain'd a Patent of the Queen to plant and inhabit ſome Northern Parts of <hi>America,</hi> unpoſſeſs'd by any Prince with whom ſhe was in Alliance, ſoon engaged <hi>Ralegh,</hi> upon his Return into <hi>England,</hi> who was always ready to graſp at every Occaſion, that might reputably advance his Fortune or his Knowledge, to embark in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. For tho' the Coaſts from the Cape of <hi>Florida</hi> Northward to the Iſles now called the <hi>Newfoundlands,</hi> had been before diſcovered by <hi>John Cabot</hi> the Father, with <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Sancius</hi> his Sons, both <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> born, through the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Expence of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. yet there wanted not only more inland Reſearches and the Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, but the very Trade and Commerce with <hi>Newfoundland</hi> was very ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected, even ſince the Reign of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> VI; <note n="*" place="bottom">And yet within four Years before Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilbert</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his Patent, there reſorted to the Coaſts of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> for Fiſh about fifty Sail of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> above a hundred Sail of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> for Cod, and thirty more from <hi>Biſcay</hi> for Whale to make Train-oil; above fifty Sail of <hi>Portugueſe;</hi> and about an hundred and fifty Sail of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Bretaigns.</hi> My Author obſerves, that the Trade our Nation had then to <hi>Iceland,</hi> was the Reaſon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not there in ſuch Numbers as other Nations.</note>for our Merchants and Adventurers in his Time enrich'd this Nation conſiderably from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0181500200:27"/>
their Fiſhery in thoſe Parts, as appears by that Act, wherein Care is taken to prevent the Exaction of any Doles or Taxes from them by the Officers of the Admiralty, that they might not be diſcourag'd from the Merchandize of Fiſh, but tranſport it more plentifully into the Realm, and at more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Rates. Now <hi>Gilbert</hi> having, as I ſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an ample Commiſſion to repoſſeſs theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages with Improvement, many Gentlemen of good Account reſorted to him, among whom was his Brother <hi>Ralegh;</hi> ſo that from theſe Preparations was expected a potent Fleet. Nevertheleſs, among ſuch Variety of Volunteers, Diſpoſitions were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; which in the End bred Diviſion, and even Confuſion of the Attempt; for, after the Shipping was by Degrees prepared, and the Men ready to go aboard; ſome diſagreeing in Opinion, ſome ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Obedience, and others failing of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Engagements; the greater Number were diſperſed, leaving the General, with a few only of his aſſured Friends. <hi>However, with theſe he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to Sea; where, having taſted of no leſs Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he was ſhortly after driven to retire home with the Loſs of a tall Ship; and more to his Grief, of a valiant Gentleman named</hi> Miles Morgan. Now this Misfortune at Sea, and Loſs of a Ship with that valiant Gentleman, I have not only Reaſon to believe was by a ſharp Encounter they had with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> however tenderly touch'd at that Time, perhaps to avoid their Triumph; but that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was in this very Engagement, and his Life in great Danger thereby. For there is another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who, in his Addreſs to him before mention'd, tells him, that after his Return from his Land-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, having gained ſufficient Knowledge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience therein; <hi>to the End that you might be every Way able to ſerve your Prince and Commonwealth</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0181500200:28"/>
(ſays he) <hi>you were deſirous to be acquainted with</hi> maritimal <hi>Affairs; then you, together with your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir</hi> Humphrey Gilbert, <hi>travelled the Seas for the Search of ſuch Countries as, if they had then been diſcover'd, infinite Commodities in ſundry Reſpects would have enſued; and whereof there was no Doubt, if the Fleet then accompanying you had, according to Appointment followed you; or your ſelf had eſcaped the dangerous</hi> Sea-fight, <hi>when many of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was ſlain, and your Ships therewith alſo ſore batter'd and diſabled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ill Succeſs kept not theſe Adventures long abroad; and now new Diſturbances broke out, which called for Men of Experience in War at home. For the firſt Dart of any Conſequence which was thrown from <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> upon <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being in 1580, we ſhall then find <hi>Ralegh</hi> among that Body of his Countrymen which effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually broke its Force, and ſhielded off the Miſchief wherewith it would otherwiſe have gall'd that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For as to the Invaſion of <hi>Thomas Stucley,</hi> two Years before, it blew over into <hi>Africa;</hi> where that Meteor of Oſtentation, and Tool of ambitious Princes, fell in the Plains of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> and with Royal Company expir'd. But now that <hi>James Fitz-Morris</hi> of the <hi>Geraldine</hi> Family was come over, and not long after <hi>San Joſepho,</hi> under the Pope's Banner, with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Forces, to aſſiſt the <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> in the <hi>Munſter</hi> Rebellion, and had landed in three Ships at <hi>Smerwick</hi> in <hi>Kerry;</hi> where having built a Fort which they call'd <hi>Fort del Ore,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortify'd it with the Benedictions of <hi>Allen</hi> an <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuit; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sir <hi>James</hi> and Sir <hi>John,</hi> Brothers to the late Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> ſoon reſorted thither to join, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces alſo did to diſperſe them.

               </gap>lain, and his Quarters expos'd at <hi>Kilmallock.</hi> The next, whoſe Fate drew on, was Sir <hi>James Deſmond,</hi> who, on the Fourth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Year, having made an Inroad upon <hi>Muſker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and taken a great Booty from Sir <hi>Cormac Mac Teige,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Cork;</hi> the ſaid Sheriff making Head againſt him, recover'd the Booty, wounded Sir <hi>James</hi> mortally, and took him Priſoner. In that Condition he was kept, till by Letters from the Lord Juſtice named Sir <hi>William Pelham,</hi> and the Council, he was deliver'd to Sir <hi>Warham Sent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leger,</hi> then Provoſt marſhal of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and to Captain <hi>Ralegh;</hi> and according to the Commiſſion directed to them, he was examin'd, indicted, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd; and then, upon Judgment; drawn, hang'd, and quarter'd; and his Head and Limbs impal'd upon the City-gates of <hi>Cork,</hi> ſor a Terror to his Aſſociates, and a Prey for the Fowls of the Air. And this is the firſt Appearance we meet with of <hi>Ralegh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> enough to ſhake the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of thoſe who ſay he was a <hi>Militia</hi> there, and had his firſt Commiſſion from <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Baron of <hi>Wilton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the chief Commander in theſe parts at this Time was the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> ſoon after Governor of <hi>Munſter,</hi> a Man of ſuch Loyalty, as to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd his rebellious Brothers to Allegiance; and of ſuch Courage, as conſtantly partaking in every Danger with his own Soldiers, made him much beloved by all his Adherents; while his apparent Contempt thereby of that Danger, gain'd him no leſs Fear from all his Adverſaries. He, on the other Side, bending his Courſe againſt the foreign Enemy, encamped his Army at <hi>Tralegh,</hi> within

Kén of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fort aforeſaid: Hereupon many of thoſe Invaders diſlodged, whom the Earl va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly engag'd, ſlaying ſome, and taking others Priſoners; the reſt flew to the Coverts of <hi>Glaningell.</hi> The Priſoners he took, confeſs'd their Force was not above ſeven hundred ſtrong; but that they had brought Arms and Ammunition for five thouſand Natives, beſides a Maſs of Money for the <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> and daily expected farther Supplies from <hi>Rome;</hi> for it was abſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Pope and King <hi>Philip</hi> to make a compleat Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; nay, ſo confident they ſeemed of Succeſs, if we can credit the Aſſertion of an Author who was this Year in <hi>Spain,</hi> that his Holineſs had provided a Chalice to drink the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s precious Blood, ſays he, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould be made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Now after the aforeſaid Defeat, about 300 of the Enemy having made their Way back to the Fort, the Earl followed them cloſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Dingle;</hi> but wanting Ammunition for a Battery, was forced to retire. And, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of unequal Force to withſtand another Salley the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made, returned to join the Deputy at <hi>Rakele;</hi> who having now about eight hundred Horſe and Foot with him, under the Conduct of Captain <hi>Ralegh, Zouch, Denny, Mackworth,</hi> and others, decamped and marched up towards the Fort. But <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who had obſerved it to be the Cuſtom of the <hi>Iriſh Kerns,</hi> upon any Diſlodgement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Camp, to flock in Parties thither, and glean away whatever they ſaw left behind; linger'd, and lay in Ambuſh to receive them. They came accordingly with their wonted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Greedineſs; but in the Midſt of their Proling, <hi>Ralegh</hi> fell upon them ſo advantageouſly, that he enclos'd them all with his Men, and took
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0181500200:31"/>
every Rebel upon the Spot, who was not ſlain in Reſiſtance. Among them there was one laden with Withies, who being demanded, <hi>What he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have done with them?</hi> Boldly anſwer'd, <hi>To have hung up the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Churls. Well,</hi> ſaid Ralegh; <hi>but they ſhall now ſerve for an</hi> Iriſh <hi>Kern;</hi> ſo commanded him to be immediately tuck'd up in one of his own Neckbands; and dealt with the reſt of theſe Robbers and Murderers according to their Deſerts. We read of another <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebel, but of greater Rank, named <hi>Brian O Rourk;</hi> who being afterwards to ſuffer at the Gallows, ſhew'd great Concern that it was to be by the common Halter; and earneſtly petition'd, not for Pardon or <hi>Preſervation</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> but that they would change the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of his <hi>Death;</hi> and inſtead of a <hi>Rope,</hi> to let him take his Swing in a <hi>Withy;</hi> but being aſk'd, <hi>Why he inſiſted upon ſuch an inſignificant Diſtinction?</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>'Twas a Diſtinction had been paid to his Countrymen before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Lord Deputy lay before the Fort, there arriv'd in the Bay of <hi>Smerwick,</hi> Vice-admiral <hi>Bingham,</hi> and ſoon after Sir <hi>William Winter,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of the Fleet, with freſh Supplies: Hereupon the Lord Deputy reſolved to beſiege the Fort by Land, while the Admiral ſhould batter it by Sea. But firſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſummon'd to ſurrender at Diſcretion; they anſwered, <hi>They were ſent, ſome from the</hi> Holy Father, <hi>who had given that Realm to King</hi> Philip; <hi>and ſome from that King, who was to recover this Land to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which by her Majeſty's Means was become ſchiſmatical and excommunicate; therefore, in ſhort, were obliged to retain what they had, and recover what they could.</hi> Nor did they omit the Advantage they thought this Parley would produce of finding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, to make a Sally upon them; but they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0181500200:32"/>
were ſo diſappointed, through the Vigilance and Valour of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Company, and that of Captain <hi>Denny,</hi> that ſuch as were not left dead behind, were forced to retreat with more Haſte than good Speed. The Culverins and other Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance being now landed, and a large mountainous Bank laboriouſly cut through, for the Carriages to paſs to the Place convenient for planting them; the Deputy is ſaid to have given the Enemy another Summons by Cannon-ſhot to ſurrender, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mercy. But they anſwer'd as before; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Artillery was order'd to attack the Fort both by Land and Water. <hi>Ralegh</hi> commanded the firſt three Days after the Opening of the Trenches; and aſſaulted the Fort ſo roughly from his Battery, that he forced the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſeveral Excurſions; but they ſkirmiſh'd ſo warily, and hived again ſo nimbly, that there was no cloſing with them effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. The fourth Day was commanded by <hi>Zouch,</hi> under whom <hi>John Cheke,</hi> the Son of a Knight well known among the learned for his Writings, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing ſo near the Fort as to look over the Parapet, being obſerved by a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who levell'd his Piece, and brought him to the Ground. But now the Trenches for the full Battery were drawn ſo near the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> play'd their Cannon ſo furiouſly and inceſſantly upon them from every Side; and finding no Succours arrive, they beat a Parley, and hung out the white Flag, crying out <hi>Miſericordia, Miſericordia;</hi> but the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty would not liſten to any Treaty with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of Traitors and Rebels; no, not ſo much as to their Departure with Bag and Baggage, or free Paſſage to any one particular Perſon; nothing but an abſolute Surrender. And as for Mercy, which <hi>Hooker</hi> before intimates to have been offer'd on proviſo of their timely Submiſſion, we find by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0181500200:33"/>
               <hi>Edmund Spenſer,</hi> who was then Secretary to the Lord Deputy, and upon the very Spot, that his Lordſhip never gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> any Hopes of it.</p>
            <p>For after the Lord Deputy had diſcovered that they had yielded, and ſurrendered the Fort, on the Ninth of <hi>November, Ralegh</hi> and <hi>Mackworth,</hi> who had the Ward of that Day, firſt entered the Caſtle, and, with their Companies, made a great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that except one <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobleman, who was reprieved, another <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> and an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who were ſent to publick Execution, except alſo <hi>San Joſepho</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commander, and his Camp maſter, with a few <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers, who were ſent Priſoners into <hi>England,</hi> and reſerved for Ranſom; all the Invaders, between four and five hundred, were, according to the Deputy's poſitive Command, put to the Sword; and the Country was thus weeded of theſe noxious Foreigners. As for <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> he never was taxed, that I can learn, with any Cruelty upon this Account, more than <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> or the reſt of the Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi> was quartered this Winter at <hi>Cork,</hi> where he obſerved the ſeditious Practices of <hi>David</hi> Lord <hi>Barry, Patrick Condon,</hi> and other Ringleaders of the Rebellion in thoſe Parts, to diſtreſs ſo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably thoſe Subjects who were peacefully inclined, and foment the diſaffected to an Inſurrection; that he was forced to take a Journey in Perſon to the Lord Deputy at <hi>Dublin;</hi> where he remonſtrated the dangerous Conſequences he foreſaw, ſo urgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, the Caſe being taken into Conſideration by his Lordſhip and the Council, they return'd him with a full Commiſſion to enter upon the Caſtle called <hi>Barry-Court,</hi> with all other Lands of the ſaid <hi>Barry,</hi> and to reduce him to Peace and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, by ſuch Means as he judg'd moſt feaſible; appointing him for his farther Enablement a Party
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0181500200:34"/>
of Horſe. In the Interim, ſuch Meaſures were uſed with thoſe in Authority at <hi>Cork,</hi> that the Commiſſion proved of little Effect; but though the ſaid Eſtate of <hi>Barry-More,</hi> was made over to the Mother of <hi>David Barry,</hi> and only rented to the Son; and though it was his principal Seat; yet partly in Fear of that Commiſſion, partly through Spite and Indignation, he burnt the Caſtle himſelf to the Ground, and waſted the Country about it with greater Outrage and Deſtruction, than his Enemies, had they taken it, would have done. Moreover, as <hi>Ralegh</hi> was on his Journey back to his Quarters, an old Rebel of <hi>Barry</hi>'s Faction, named <hi>Fitz-Edmonds,</hi> and his Crew ſallied from their Ambuſcade, and croſs'd him, to oppoſe his Paſſage, whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> manfully encountered and defeated, or at leaſt broke thro' them, ſo that he got clear over the River; but one of his Company, Mr. <hi>Henry Mole,</hi> following, his Horſe foundering, threw him down in the Middle of it; where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fear of drowning and being taken by the Enemies, he called out to <hi>Ralegh</hi> for Help; who, tho' he had eſcaped both Dangers, yet incurred them again to ſave his Companion's Life; but <hi>Moyle,</hi> in Haſte and Confuſion remounting, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leap'd his Horſe, and fell down on the other Side into a deep Mire, where he might have been ſtifled, had not <hi>Ralegh</hi> recovered him a ſecond Time, and brought him ſafe to Land; but his Horſe run over to the Rebels. <hi>Ralegh</hi> waited on the oppoſite Bank, with his Staff <note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe Staves were not ſhort like Truncheons, but rather like Poles, or Watermen's Stretchers, though not ſo long or clumſily made; for being headed at one End with a ſharp Point or Pile of Iron, they might be uſed for Defence, or Offence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Quarter ſtaves, or Spears.</note>in one Hand, and a Piſtol in the other, for the reſt of his Company who were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0181500200:35"/>
yet to croſs the River; among whom was his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Jenkin,</hi> who had two hundred Pounds of his Money in Charge; a Sum in thoſe Days enough to make a Soldier of Fortune in theſe Circumſtances look about him; eſpecially now <hi>Fitz Edmonds</hi> had got a Recruit of twelve Men, and was in all above twenty ſtrong againſt him. Yet this Hero, as his Party called him, when he beheld <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſtand his Ground, and the reſt of his Company advance, whom he poſſibly thought might be of greater Number than they were, only exchanged a few rough Words with him, and thought it beſt to offer no further Moleſtation.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> departed from his long and weariſome Services here to <hi>England,</hi> about the Spring of the Year 1581. His Government of <hi>Munſter</hi> was given to Captain <hi>Ralegh,</hi> in Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with Sir <hi>William Morgan</hi> and Captain <hi>Piers. Ralegh</hi> lay for the moſt Part at <hi>Liſmore;</hi> and, in the Country and Woods thereabouts, ſpent all this Summer in continual Action againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Ralegh</hi> removed with his little Band of fourſcore Foot and eight Horſe, to his old Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at <hi>Cork;</hi> but receiving Intelligence by the Way, that the Arch-traitor <hi>Barry</hi> was at <hi>Clove,</hi> with ſeveral hundred Men, he reſolved to paſs through that Town, and offer him the Combat. Accordingly at the Town's End he met <hi>Barry</hi> and his Forces, whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> charged with great Bravery, and put him to Flight. As he purſued his Journey, he overtook another Company of the Enemy in a Plain, by a Wood-ſide; upon whom, having only ſix Horſemen with him, expecting probably his Company would ſoon join him, he gave the Onſet; but the Rebels, who were in much greater Number, being cut off from the Wood, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0181500200:36"/>
having no other Relief, faced about, and fought very deſperately, killing five of the Horſes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Company, whereof his own was one, and he himſelf very near being over-borne by the Numbers upon him, had not his truſty Servant <hi>Nicholas Wright,</hi> a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Man, interpos'd; who perceiving his Maſter's Horſe ſo mortally wounded with Darts, and plunging paſt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, encounter'd ſix of the Enemy at once, and killed one of them; while another of his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants, named <hi>Patrick Fagaw,</hi> reſcued <hi>Ralegh;</hi> which had been ſo unſucceſsfully attempted by <hi>James Fitz-Richard</hi> and his Kern, both of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that the Man was ſlain, and the Maſter very near the ſame Fate; whereupon <hi>Ralegh</hi> would not ſuffer <hi>Wright</hi> to fight by him any longer, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him <hi>to charge above hand, and ſave the Gentleman:</hi> At which Command he ruſh'd into the Throng of the Enemy, diſpatch'd the Antagoniſt who preſs'd foreſt upon Mr. <hi>Fitz-Richard,</hi> and reſcued him. In this ſharp Skirmiſh, there were many of the Rebels ſlain, and two taken Priſoners, whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> carried with him to <hi>Cork;</hi> and while he lay here, he performed ſeveral other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Services, which deſerve to be for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter'd.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt, his excellent Conduct in the Seizure of the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> is more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd and applauded. This Nobleman, being much ſuſpected to hold Confederacy with ſome of the chief Rebels, <hi>Ralegh</hi> undertook to bring, with his Family, before the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> at <hi>Cork.</hi> But the Deſign of this hazardous Surpriſe took Air among the Enemy, and a Party of 800 Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Fitz-Edmonds</hi> and <hi>Barry,</hi> were gather'd to way-lay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> either going or coming. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Ralegh,</hi> knowing the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> to be a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0181500200:37"/>
powerful and popular Man among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ſo ſuddenly commanded all his Company to be in Readineſs by Eleven a-Clock that Night, and they were ſo punctual to the Hour, that he directly marched away to <hi>Bally</hi> in <hi>Harſh,</hi> which was <hi>Roch</hi>'s Seat, about twenty Miles from <hi>Cork,</hi> and eſcaped the Ambuſcade. He arrived there by Break of Day; but the Townſmen were ſo alarmed, that they ſoon gathered 500 ſtrong. <hi>Ralegh</hi> drew up, and in ſuch Manner beſtowed his Men in the Town it ſelf, that he ſoon quell'd and reſtrain'd the People there; then ſelecting half a Dozen out of his Company; and having appointed another little Party to follow him, he marched up to the Caſtle. He was met by three or four of <hi>Roch</hi>'s Gentlemen, of whom he deſir'd to ſpeak with their Lord; which was agreed to, on Condition he would diſmiſs three or four of his own Attendants; to which, with apparent Readineſs, he comply'd; but ſo contrived, that none of them were locked out. Then he gave them Directions which Way the reſt alſo, without the Gates, might be admitted, whilſt he ſhould hold the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> in Diſcourſe; which ſucceeded ſo happily, that by Degrees his whole Compliment were got within the Court-yard, ſome guarding the Gates, others watching in the Hall, each having his Piece loaden with a Brace of Balls. The Lord <hi>Roch</hi> was amaz'd and terrify'd at ſo ſilent and inſenſible a Seizure; but, diſſembling his Uneaſineſs, he would needs have <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and the Gentlemen with him, participate of his plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Table; yet the Policy of his Hoſpitality did not defeat that of their Enterpriſe; for, as ſoon as the Dinner was over, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ingenuouſly laid open the Occaſion of his Viſit. Lord <hi>Roch</hi> made many Excuſes, and in the End abſolutely refuſed to go along with him. But when the Commiſſion was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0181500200:38"/>
produced, and he found <hi>Ralegh</hi> inflexible, he choſe to do that by Conſent, which he found he muſt do by Compulſion. Then <hi>Ralegh</hi> urged him to oblige his Townſmen likewiſe, who had ſo faithfully riſen for his Defence in his Neighbourhood, to eſcort and defend him in his Journey; to which Lord <hi>Roch</hi> alſo conſented, profeſſing he doubted not but to clear himſelf of whatever Allegations ſhould be laid to his Charge. When his Lordſhip, with his Lady and Attendants, had made themſelves ready, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was for another nocturnal Progreſs; but though the Night fell out ſo very dark and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous, and the Ways were ſo full of Hills and Dales, Rocks and Precipices, that many of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were much bruiſed by Falls, and one of them ſo mortify'd, that he loſt his Life in the March; yet the Veil wherewith the reſt were ſhelter'd, by that Obſcurity, from the more dangerous Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades of their Enemy, who had every where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrew'd the Paſſages to intercept them, made ſuch ſufficient Compenſation for thoſe Diſaſters, that by the next Morning early he ſafely preſented his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to the General, not without raiſing an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Aſtoniſhment at his dexterous Evaſion of ſo many Perils. But the Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> upon Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination being honourably acquitted, he approved himſelf a faithful Subject ever after, and three of his Sons laid down their Lives in her Majeſty's Service.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſame Year, the Lord Deputy made the aforeſaid Captain <hi>John Zouch</hi> Governor of <hi>Munſter,</hi> with whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> and <hi>Dowdal</hi> made ſeveral Journeys to ſettle and compoſe the Country; but the certain Place of their Reſidence was at <hi>Cork.</hi> And when <hi>Zouch,</hi> with <hi>Dowdal,</hi> made that ſecret Expedition, in which he lopp'd off the third Branch of this veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0181500200:39"/>
Hydra, Sir <hi>John Deſmond;</hi> whoſe Body was hung by the Heels on a Gibbet, then fixed on the Gates of that City, and his Head ſent to <hi>London;</hi> he left the Government of <hi>Cork</hi> to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who appears no longer, after this Reduction, in the Wars of <hi>Ireland:</hi> But how well his Services were received by the Queen, and how nobly ſhe reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for them after the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> himſelf was ſlain, we ſhall hear when we arrive at the Time that his large Poſſeſſions came to be divided among thoſe who had aſſiſted in quenching the Flames of his Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi> was not long in <hi>England,</hi>  before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in ſome Degree to the Court began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Tradition has induſtriouſly abſcrib'd his firſt Introduction thither to a Piece of Gallantry, wherewith he ſurpris'd the Queen accidentally in one of her Walks. <hi>Her Majeſty meeting (ſays my Author) with a plaſhy Place, made ſome Scruple to go on; when Ralegh (dreſs'd in the gay and genteel Habit of thoſe Times) preſently caſt off and ſpread his new Pluſh-cloak on the Ground, whereon the Queen trod gently over, rewarding him afterwards with many Suits for his ſo free and ſeaſonable Tender of ſo fair a</hi> Foot-cloth: <hi>Thus an advantageous Admiſſion into the Notice of a Prince, is more than half a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Preferment.</hi> After this, Ralegh coming to Court, and finding ſome Hopes of the Queen's Favour reflecting upon him, he wrote in a Glaſs Window, obvious to her Eye,
<q>
                  <l>Fain would I climb, yet fear I to fall.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Under which her Majeſty ſoon after wrote,
<q>
                  <l>If thy Heart fail thee, climb not at all.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0181500200:40"/>
But though he always made a very elegant Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as well in the Splendor of Attire, as the Politeneſs of Addreſs; <hi>having a good Preſence, in a handſome and well compacted Perſon; a ſtrong natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wit, and a better Judgment; with a bold and plauſible Tongue, whereby he could ſet out his Parts to the beſt Advantage:</hi> All very engaging Advocates for Royal Favour, eſpecially in a female Sovereign: But be that as it may, we find him, upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> employed in an Expedition or two, by Authority belike from the Court; they being upon Occaſions of State. And though it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not much whether it was now, or before he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he accompanied the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, Monſieur <hi>Simier,</hi> among thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were appointed for his ſafe Convoy to <hi>France;</hi> yet if that Ambaſſador returned home, when his Maſter the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> came laſt over in <hi>November,</hi> the Year before-named, this is the Place for it to be mentioned in.</p>
            <p>But after the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> himſelf had been three Months in <hi>England,</hi> he alſo departed to take upon him the Government of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> This Departure was in <hi>February</hi> following; and though the Queen ſeems to have declined the Marriage with him, principally becauſe ſhe found her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſo averſe to it; yet there was an Author, and his Printer, who, for having publiſhed a little Treatiſe againſt it about two Years before, <note n="*" place="bottom">This Treatiſe is entitled, <hi>The Diſcovery of a gaping Gulph, wherein</hi> England <hi>is likely to be ſwallowed by another</hi> French <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> &amp;c.

They attended the Duke to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt magnificent Proceſſion, he was created Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> &amp;c. and inveſted with his Charge. <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſeems not only to have ſtaid there ſome Time after the Lord Admiral <hi>Howard, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> young <hi>Sidney,</hi> and the reſt were return'd; but, through the Opportunity of being perſonally known to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> honoured with ſome ſpecial Acknowledgments from him to the Queen of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>Ralegh</hi> mentions thus much himſelf, in a Diſcourſe he wrote many Years afterwards; wherein, fpeaking of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> flouriſhing State, he lays down, as the firſt Cauſe thereof, the Favour and Aſſiſtance granted them by this Crown; <hi>which, ſays he, the late worthy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>did always acknowledge; and in the Year</hi> 1582, <hi>when I took my Leave of him at</hi> Antwerp, <hi>after the Return of the Earl of</hi> Leiceſter <hi>into</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Monſieur<hi>'s Arrival there; when he delivered me his Letters to her Majeſty, he prayed me to ſay to the Queen from him,</hi> Sub umbra alarum tuarum protegimur: <hi>For certainly (ſays he) they had</hi> wither'd <hi>in the</hi> Bud, <hi>and</hi> ſunk <hi>in the Beginning of their</hi> Navigation, <hi>had not her Majeſty aſſiſted them.</hi>

Sir <hi>Robert Naunton is confident, that among the ſecond Cauſes of</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Growth (not denying, or rather acquieſcing in his Actions and Accompliſhments to have been the firſt) that Variance between him and the Lord</hi> Grey, <hi>in his Deſcent into</hi> Ireland, <hi>was a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; for it drew them both over (ſays he) to the Council-table, there to plead their Cauſe; where (what Advantage he had in the Cauſe, my ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor knew not, but ſays) he had much the better in telling of his Tale; and ſo much, that the Queen and the Lords took no ſlight Mark of the Man and his Parts; for from thence he came to be known, and to have Acceſs to the Queen and the Lords.</hi> Now if this Author is ſo defective, as not to have known the Cauſe or Subject of their Quarrel; or, that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> long before the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> was not likely to be drawn over together with him to the Council table; how much more muſt thoſe Writers following him be ſo, who have confuſed this Matter with ſeveral other Particulars; though they ſeem to have had no other Authority? One of them ſays, <hi>Ralegh</hi> had in <hi>Deed,</hi> but not in <hi>Truth,</hi> the better by the Tongue; and inſinuates (with great Caution and Delicacy he thought, no Doubt) that the Queen had been told ſomething ſo engaging of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> beſides his Advantage in Pleading, that it was <hi>not to be mentioned;</hi> as if any of her Courtiers dared to ſay any Thing to the Queen's Face, which this anonymous Writer, near fifty Years after her Death, would be either aſham'd or afraid to repeat. A later Writer makes ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s extraordinary Behaviour in this Diſpute, as if he had been at the Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſeen as well as heard him. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after them all, has found out the Cauſe of

            <p>It is hinted to us ſomewhat more expreſly, by another Court-writer of thoſe Times, that the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> befriended <hi>Ralegh</hi> (perhaps through his Friendſhip with young <hi>Sidney,</hi> that Earl's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily beloved Nephew) in his firſt Advancement at Court; and that being willing, for his own Eaſe, to beſtow handſomely upon another ſome Part of the Pains, and perhaps of the Envy, to which a long indulgent Fortune is obnoxious, either brought or let him into that promiſing Sphere of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where the Earl ſoon found him ſuch an Apprentice, as knew well enough how to ſet up for himſelf. So that if the Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0181500200:44"/>
               <hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s Antagoniſt, had any Hand in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Riſe, as ſome later Writers of leſs Authority have ſuggeſted, it ſeems to have been afterwards, when <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s courtly Splendor was ſomewhat obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> meant to allay it, by interpoſing the young Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> for <hi>Ralegh</hi> continued, during that Storm, in ſome Luſtre of a favoured Man, like Billows which ſink but by Degrees, even when the Wind is down that firſt ſtirr'd them. But this we ſhall obſerve as we go on, that in all the different Aſpects or Conjunctions of Intereſt, thro' the Acceſs or Change of new Favourites in this long Reign, none were leſs immerg'd by the Smiles of the Court, in the Luxuries and Vanities of it, nor more animated by its Frowns to the enterpriſing of publick and ſuperior Difficulties for the Honour and Aggrandiſement of his Country. Not that he ſet out to Sea, but when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of raiſing himſelf on Shore; for theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Enterprizes were rooted ſo early in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Mind, that we perceive, even now, before Factions at Court could drive him from the Land, or Preferments and Grants from the Crown enable him for the Sea; that he had built at his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to proſecute them, a ſtrong handſome Ship, which was named <hi>Bark Ralegh,</hi> of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ton Burden.</p>
            <p>And now that the ſix Years Period of Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Gilbert</hi>'s Patent grew ſhort, four of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elaps'd, he thought it high Time to make a new Attempt in Perſon (ſince his Aſſignments had proved of little Conſequence) at thoſe Diſcoveries he had before fail'd in, that he might confirm by Experience what he had ſo excellently advanced in Theory. Accordingly, having fitted out a Fleet of four Ships, <hi>Ralegh</hi> alſo victuall'd, and mann'd out his before-mentioned, which was the largeſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0181500200:45"/>
among them; and, in the Quality of Vice-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, ſet out to bear his Brother <hi>Gilbert</hi> Company, in this his laſt Expedition to <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> The Fleet departed from <hi>Plymouth</hi> on the 11th of <hi>June</hi> 1583. My Author, who was in this Voyage, tells us, no Coſt was ſpared by <hi>Ralegh</hi> in Proviſions and Neceſſaries for the happy Accompliſhment of it; yet that in two or three Days following he returned greatly diſtreſs'd to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> by Reaſon his whole Ship's Company was infected with a contagious Sickneſs. But lucky to him, perhaps, was this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation; ſince the Voyage proved ſo fatal to thoſe who went through it, particularly Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelf; who, tho' he arrived in <hi>Newfoundland</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following; took Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Country in Right of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by digging up a Turf, and receiving it with a Haſel Wand, delivered to him according to our Law and Cuſtom; alſo had aſſign'd Lands to every Man in his Company, and was got three hundred Leagues in his Way home again, with full Hopes of the Queen's Aſſiſtance to fit out a Fleet not only for the North, but one alſo for the South next Year; yet over-hardily venturing in a little Frigat of but ten Ton Burden, called the <hi>Squirrel;</hi> he was on the Ninth of <hi>September</hi> following at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in a high Sea, ſwallowed up. <note n="*" place="bottom">As Authors have been very defective and erroneous in their Accounts of this brave and publick-ſpirited, but unfortunate Knight, Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Compton;</hi> I ſhall here obſerve that <hi>John Hooker,</hi> who knew him, ſays he was bred at <hi>Oxford. Hooker</hi> takes Notice of his extraordinary Services in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for which he was made Colonel of <hi>Munſter;</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> in his <hi>Actions of the Low countries,</hi> tells us he was the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commander who led a Regiment thither to ſerve the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But <hi>John Prince,</hi> who pretends to give us his Life among his Worthies of <hi>Devon,</hi> mentions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Land-ſervices. The ſaid <hi>J. Prince</hi> quotes Sir <hi>W. Pole</hi>'s MSS. to vouch this <hi>Gilbert</hi>'s being knighted by the Queen at <hi>Greenwich</hi> 1577. But <hi>Hooker</hi> aforeſaid ſhews him to have been knighted in the Church at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> by Sir <hi>Hon.

Digges</hi>'s Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before mentioned, p. 299. Laſtly, another Writer of his Life, in <hi>Latin,</hi> places his laſt Expedition to <hi>Newfoundland</hi> 20 Years ſooner than he undertook it, if it is not the Fault rather of the Printer than the Author, <hi>Vid. Hollandi Herwologia Anglica.</hi> fol. <hi>Arnheim</hi> 1620, p. 65. As for Sir <hi>Humphrey</hi>'s Writings, we have extant in <hi>Hakluyt,</hi> Vol. 3. p. 11. his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> to prove a Paſſage by the North-weſt to <hi>Cathay</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> in ten Chapters; firſt publiſh'd in 4to. 1576. at the End of which he mentions another Diſcourſe, now loſt I fear; wherein he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the uſual Errors of <hi>Sea-cards,</hi> which make the Degrees of Longitude in every Latitude of equal Bigneſs; and invented a <hi>ſpherical Inſtrument,</hi> with a <hi>Compaſs of Variation,</hi> for the perfect Knowledge of the Longitude; and laid down a preciſe Order to prick the <hi>Sea-cards,</hi> with certain Rules for the ſhortning any Diſcovery, and knowing at the firſt Entrance of any <hi>Fret,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it lies open to the Ocean more Ways than one, and how far the <hi>Sea</hi> ſtretches itſelf into the <hi>Land.</hi> As for the Picture at <hi>Compton,</hi> ſaid by <hi>Prince</hi> to be drawn for Sir <hi>H.

But the ſtately Poem in <hi>Latin Hexameters,</hi> upon his laſt Expedition, by <hi>Stephanus Parmenius Budeius,</hi> a learned <hi>Hungarian,</hi> who was drowned with him, was undoubtedly, among other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers therein nam'd, chiefly intended for his Honour.</note> Another

Countries upon private Men's Purſes, than he and others had perſuaded themſelves, to their own Loſs and Detriment; but neither theſe unfortunate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts by Sea hitherto, nor the Ruin of Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Gilbert</hi>'s Eſtate, nor the Loſs of his Life, nor the Hardſhips of all his Company beſides, could teach <hi>Ralegh</hi> that Leſſon: Theſe Examples and this Experience were ſo far from ſatiating, that they did but ſharpen his Appetite to ſuch honourable Dangers.</p>
            <p>And as we are aſſured from Family Tradition, by a late Author of his own Name and Lineage, that the Diſcoveries of the great <hi>Columbus,</hi> the Conqueſts of <hi>Fernando Cortez,</hi> the famous <hi>Francis Pizarro,</hi> and other Leaders of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who under the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> and his Son <hi>Philip</hi> II. had made the greateſt and moſt ſurpriſing Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their Empire that ever Prince received, or Subjects wrought, were the favourite Hiſtories that took up <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s early Reading and Converſation while he was but a young Man; we may preſume they ſo poſſeſſed his noble Genius (with perhaps alſo ſome late domeſtic and living Examples) that no little perſonal Oppoſitions at Home, or particular Miſadventures Abroad, could ever diſcourage him from the Purſuit of theſe grand and national Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. But when, by his own Obſervation, he found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had only ſettled upon the middle and ſouthern Parts of <hi>America,</hi> and that there were certain vaſt Territories yet unknown to the North of thoſe Lands, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> already enjoyed, as fit perhaps for Settlement, and as eaſy to conquer, as any they did enjoy: And when, by his Enquiries, among the moſt obſervant Pilots and Mariners who had ſailed in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship to the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> many of whom he had Opportunity to meet and diſcourſe with in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0181500200:48"/>
               <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> he had learnt that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> always went into the Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> by <hi>St. Domingo</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> where the Currents with the Trade-winds always ran together, and ſet into the Bay; that they always diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogu'd, as they called it, or came out by the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana</hi> and the Channels of <hi>Bahama,</hi> which they now call the Gulph of <hi>Florida;</hi> and that, as they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Gulph, they found a continued Coaſt on the Weſt Side trending away North, which they generally loſt Sight of by ſtanding away to the Eaſt, to make for the Coaſt of <hi>Spain; Ralegh</hi> fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that there was a vaſt Extent of Land North of that Gulph, or Weſt from the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> which might be well worth diſcovering; and, after mature Deliberation, fully reſolved upon the Diſcovery. As ſoon as he had digeſted his Propoſal, and diſplayed the Manner of proſecuting it in proper Schemes, he laid them before the Queen and Council, to whom it appearing a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, practical, and generous Undertaking, her Majeſty was pleaſed in the Beginning of the Year 1584, to grant him full Power to enjoy ſuch Countries as he propoſed to diſcover, by her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon the Grant of this Patent, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> gave his Inſtructions for an <hi>American</hi> Voyage <note n="*" place="bottom">But that he now ſailed thither himſelf, or then made the Diſcovery, whatever he might do before, of the Country here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned, in Perſon, and returned in the Beginning of 1585, as the Author of his Life, in <hi>Lives Engliſh and Foreign,</hi> tells us, vol.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0181500200:49"/>
from the Weſt of <hi>England.</hi> The 10th of <hi>May</hi> they arrived at the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and a Month after fell upon the Iſles of the <hi>Weſt-Indies, which, with the Reſt adjoining (ſays my Author, one of thoſe Captains) are ſo well known to yourſelf (directing the Account of this Voyage to his Proprietor) and to many others, that I will not trouble you with the Remembrance of them.</hi> In the Beginning of <hi>July</hi> they were ſaluted with a moſt fragrant Gale from the Land they were ſeeking, and ſoon after arrived upon the Coaſt; but ſailed along ſome ſix-ſcore Miles before they could find an Entrance by any River iſſuing into the Sea. At laſt, diſcovering one, they manned out their Boats to view the Land adjoining, where they ſaw Vines laden with Grapes in vaſt Abundance, climbing up the tall Cedars, and ſpreading ſo luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riantly along the ſandy Shore, that the Sea often over-flowed them. On the 13th of <hi>July</hi> they took Poſſeſſion in Right of the Queen, and afterwards delivered the Country over to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Uſe. They thought this Land had at firſt been the Continent, but found it afterwards only an Iſland 20 Miles long, called <hi>Wocoken;</hi> plentifully ſtocked with Animals, Groves of ſweet-ſmelling Trees, Pulſe, Grain, and eſculent Roots. They obſerved along the Coaſt, a Tract of Iſlands 2 or 300 Miles long; and paſſing between them, ſaw another great Sea, 20, 40, and in ſome Places 50 Miles over, before they could reach the Continent; and in this incloſed Sea above 100 Iſlands of various Size, whereof one is 16 Miles long, called <hi>Roanoak,</hi> and about ſeven Leagues diſtant, up the River <hi>Occam,</hi> from the Harbour they firſt entered; at which they chiefly ſettled while they ſtaid, finding it ſo pleaſant and fruitful as to yield three Harveſts in five Months. But they remained upon the Borders of <hi>Wocoken</hi> two Days before they beheld a human Creature; on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0181500200:50"/>
the third, they ſaw a Boat rowing towards them with three of the Natives; one of them landed, and walked up the Shore near their Ship, for they were then on Board; then the two Captains, with ſome others, took their Boat and rowed to Land, and by their courteous Carriage, ſoon prevailed on the Native to return with them on Board, where they cloathed him, and gave him Victuals, Wine, and ſeveral little Toys or Utenſils, which won the ſimple Creature's Heart. Soon after his Departure he returned again with a Boat full of Fiſh, to be divided between the Ship and the Pinnace, and then he left them. The next Day came the King's Brother <hi>Granganimeo,</hi> with a great many Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; for the King himſelf, who was named <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina,</hi> and his large Territories <hi>Wingandacoa,</hi> lay ill of the Wounds he had lately received in War. His Brother was highly pleaſed with his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and having received ſeveral Preſents, ſoon after ſent the Savages to traffick with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> alſo came again himſelf, and exchanged 20 Skins, worth as many Nobles, for a Tin Diſh, which he hung as a Gorget about his Neck, to defend him from the Arrows of his Enemies: Then alſo he brought his Wife and Children, with her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants 40 or 50 in Number. She was well-favour'd, but baſhful, clad in a Mantle of Deer-ſkin, lined with Fur, and a Kind of Apron of the ſame, her Hair hung down long on each Side, with a Band of white Coral about her Forehead, and long Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Pearl down to her Middle, as big as Peaſe in her Ears, <hi>a Bracelet whereof, we delivered to your worſhip,</hi> ſays my Author to <hi>Ralegh.</hi> Her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Apparel was much like hers, only about his Head he wore a broad Plate of Gold or Copper, and his Hair was long but on one Side. After this Interview, familiar Commerce paſſed between
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0181500200:51"/>
the Natives and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, when they went to <hi>Roanoak,</hi> were much careſs'd and treated by the Lady aforeſaid. And when ſhe could not prevail with them to ſtay, being but few in Company, though the Natives had no Edge-tools of Iron or Steel, and had proffered a great Box of Pearl for ſome Armour and a Sword, ſhe ſent her Women to watch them all Night in their Ships on the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. And indeed all the People, who ſaw them, admired much at their Ships, their Fire-arms, their Cloaths, and above all, their Complexions; for, except a Veſſel which was caſt away with ſome chriſtian Adventurers about 26 Years before near <hi>Secotan,</hi> the ſouthermoſt Town in <hi>Wingandacoa,</hi> never any People in Apparel, or of fair Colour were ſeen or heard of among them; which made them wonder ſo much at the Whiteneſs of their Skins, and ſo fond of ſeeing and touching them. Under theſe favourable Recommendations, and the Diſtreſs which the Natives were in for ſome power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends to defend them from the Invaſions of their Neighbours, the Promiſes of viſiting them again, wherewith the <hi>Engliſh</hi> left them, after having learnt as much of the Situation, State and Product of the Country, as was at this Time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, were very acceptable. So bringing over a Couple of the <hi>Indians</hi> with them, named <hi>Manteo</hi> and <hi>Wancheſe,</hi> to ſhew them our fine Country, they arrived ſafely in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> about the Middle of <hi>September</hi> following.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ralegh</hi> had laid before her Majeſty theſe and all other Reports moſt worthy of Notice, of this rich, beautiful and Virgin Country; and had acknowledged how much this hopeful Progreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Poſſeſſion of it was owing to the Auſpices of a Virgin Queen; ſhe was ſo well pleaſed with the Honour and Advantage it promiſed, and gave
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0181500200:52"/>
him ſuch Encouragement to compleat the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, which he forthwith prepared to do by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expedition, that ſhe called it herſelf by the Name of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two Months after, he was elected a Knight of the Shire for the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> Sir <hi>William Courtenay</hi> being the other Repreſentative. There was then a Clerk of the Parliament ſo very indolent, or otherwiſe indiſpoſed, that the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Houſe of Commons at this Time were very imperfectly recorded. Yet we find <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> mentioned to have been choſen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees upon ſome Bills that were then read. On the 14th of <hi>December</hi> following, the Bill, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his Patent aforeſaid for the Diſcovery of Foreign Countries, was read the firſt Time. In the Afternoon it was read the ſecond Time, and committed to the Vice-chamberlain <hi>Hatton,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Greenfield</hi> (or <hi>Grenvill),</hi> Sir <hi>William Courtenay,</hi> Sir <hi>William Mohun,</hi> and others. Three Days after the ſaid Bill was, without any Alteration, ordered to be engroſſed. The next Day it was read the third Time, when it paſſed the Houſe. Between this Time and the 24th of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> following he received the Honour of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for being then in a Committee for conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after what Manner and Meaſure they ſhould ſupply her Majeſty by Subſidy: This is the earlieſt Time I meet with of his being ſtiled Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> a Title which her Majeſty beſtowed, as all others of Honour, with Frugality and Choice.

There were no Reſtrictions belike in this Patent from increaſing the Number of Vintners in any Part of the Realm. And hence aroſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy at this Time with one of the Univerſities.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0181500200:54"/>
For <hi>Ralegh</hi> having by Virtue of that general Patent given Licence to one <hi>John Keymer</hi> to ſell Wine in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſome of the hotter Heads, eſpecially the other Vintners there, among whom was <hi>Baxter,</hi> a 'Squire Beadle, licenſed to ſell Wine by that Univerſity, oppoſed this <hi>Keymer</hi> and his Wife with ſuch Violence, that ſhe was likely to have died. Complaint being made to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> he wrote a Letter to <hi>The worſhipful Dr.</hi> Howland, <hi>Vice-chancellor and the Reſt of the Maſters,</hi> to tell them how much he took this riotous Demeanor as a Contempt of the Queen's Grant to him; preſuming, if he had given any unlawful Privilege, the Conference he had offered, by his Deputies, for a quiet Deciſion of the Matter by learned Council between them, would have been accepted. Further telling them, that if the Abuſe was not regulated, and the ſaid <hi>Keymer</hi> permitted to enjoy the Liberty granted him, he would take ſome other Courſe for Reformation therein; but reſting aſſured they would uſe ſuch means as might occaſion no further Trouble, he not deſiring to execute his Grant to its Extent among their Vintners, who were the only Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers herein, reſpecting more their own Gain than quiet Government; he only craves their Anſwer, and that the riotous Perſons might not reſt unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: So bids them heartily farewel; from his Lodgings at the Court the 9th of <hi>July</hi> 1584; and ſubſcribes himſelf <hi>Your very affectionate loving Friend.</hi> This producing no Anſwer in ſeven Months, and <hi>Ralegh</hi> having heard they continued to oppreſs <hi>Keymer;</hi> he wrote again; <hi>To his loving Friend the Vice-chancellor,</hi> &amp;c. telling him, that being by Information perſwaded, himſelf, with the grave and well-diſpoſed of the Univerſity, were ſo grieved with the unſeemly Outrages lately commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the young and unbridled Heads thereof, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0181500200:55"/>
the Contempt of the Queen's Prerogative and his Diſcredit, as ſufficient Order had been taken for the Bearer's Quiet; which cauſed him to reſt from requiring Reformation therein at his good Lord-treaſurer's Hands; who as yet underſtood nothing from him of theſe Riots, through the Good-will he bore to their Univerſity: And that he meant ſo to deal with them for the other four Taverns, as ſhould ſufficiently have contented them. But his too favourable Dealing with them had given ſuch Encouragement, as, that, intending further to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Bearer, they had warned him to appear before them; with which he had perſuaded him to comply. Upon their ſending no Anſwer to this, and <hi>Ralegh</hi> hearing they had ſuddenly clapped up the Man in Priſon, he ſent 10 Days after the laſt, his third Letter from the Court, directed <hi>To the Vice-chancellor, and the reſt of the Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. And herein tells them, he cannot a little marvel at their peremptory and proud Manner of Dealing. That he was content to uſe all Manner of Courteſy towards them in Reſpect of his honourable good Lord the Lord-treaſurer; but perceived his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or rather too ſubmiſs Dealing, had bred in them a Proceeding unſufferable; having committed a poor Man to Priſon, for doing nothing but what was warranted by the great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> which, ſuppoſing they had a Charter, he knew not that any Man or Society would ſo much take upon them to do, before a Trial. <hi>As I reverence the Place,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of which you are the Governors, ſo I will not willingly take any Wrong or Diſgrace from you.</hi> But as he was aſſured the Lord-treaſurer would be indifferent in the Caſe, and as the Matter ſo much concerned the Validity of his Patent elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as well as in their Univerſity, he would try the utmoſt of his Right as well for this one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0181500200:56"/>
he was content to have been ſatisfied, as for all the other four. So having thought they would have vouchſafed him an Anſwer to his laſt Letters, he ends, ſubſcribing himſelf <hi>Your Friend, as you ſhall gave Cauſe.</hi> This rous'd them to ſome Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſoon after, a handſome apologetical Letter was ſent from the <hi>Vice-chancellor to Sir</hi> W. Ralegh, ſetting forth, that the hard Opinion he had conceived of them for this Matter, made them doubt what Manner of Anſwer they might addreſs to him without Offence; and that their Silence was ſo ill taken, they knew not how their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to excuſe it might give him Satisfaction. That they had not neglected any reaſonable Means to procure his Favour for the quiet Enjoyment of that whereof they had the Fruition for above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years; nor omitted to become Petitioners to him in a very humble Manner. That his Counſel had not made any juſt Exception againſt their Charters; and thoſe who had the Hearing of the Caſe, thought them to have the better Warrant. Yet that he uſed ſuch hard Terms, as they little looked for at his Hands; <hi>being by Birth a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; by Education trained up to the Knowledge of good Letters; inſtructed with the liberal Diſpoſition of a Univerſity, the Fountain and Nurſery of all Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and further, by God's good Bleſſing, advanc'd in Court, from whence the very Name of Courteſy is drawn.</hi> That the Prejudice he apprehended from their Example againſt his Patent, was unlikely to fall out; ſince other Places were not privileged as the Univerſities were. That her Majeſty's Grant, by her Prerogative, gave him his Title; and the like Prerogative was the Ground of their Charters. And as he would think it hard to have his Patent impeach'd by an After-grant, they hoped he would with like Equity meaſure them, who were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0181500200:57"/>
to have the ſole Dealing with all Vintners in <hi>Cambridge</hi> Town, and the Precincts thereof. Touching the Impriſonment of the Party, whom he charged them with proceeding againſt before Trial; and who, according to Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the Lord-treaſurer, was to have given over at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt; however the Courſe thereof had been otherwiſe reported to him, it was only at this Time to correct his Contempt in not appearing, being lawfully warned, and refuſing to anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordinary Judge, or enter Bond for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance when Cauſe ſhould require. That for their own Part, it would be no Diſadvantage whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or other, one or many, were Vintners there; but in Regard of the Youth committed to their Charge, Duty bound them to conſider who they admitted to keep Taverns, the Number whereof was alſo limited; which, if they exceeded, would endanger their Privileges; for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof as they had all taken a ſpecial Oath, ſo they right humbly <hi>eftſoons</hi> beſeech'd him to have Regard of them for their Duties therein. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thus; <hi>Whatever Kindneſs you ſhall any Ways ſhew to the Univerſity; as the Body thereof doth ſtill continue, ſo the Memory thereof cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. There is not one of us, but you may readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand wherein it may pleaſe you to employ us; only we pray you, and that in the heartieſt Manner, to vouchſaſe us your Favour in Matter of our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges;</hi> That we may leave them in no worſe Eſtate to our Poſterity; than we did receive them of our Predeceſſors. <hi>Thus deſiring God ſo to direct you with his bleſſed Spirit, as may be moſt to his Glory, and your greateſt Comfort, we take our Leave; from</hi> Cambridge. This might probably pacify <hi>Ralegh</hi> at preſent, both for their Neglect in not anſwering his Letters, and their Forwardneſs in impriſoning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0181500200:58"/>
the Man; till the Difference was a few Months afterwards accommodated by the Lord-treaſurer, who was Chancellor of that Univerſity. <note n="†" place="bottom">For the ſaid Lord-treaſurer <hi>Burghley</hi> ſent, in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Norgate,</hi> his Vice chancellor, on the 26th of <hi>July</hi> 1585, the Opinion of the two chief Juſtices, Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wraye</hi> and Sir <hi>Edmond Anderſon,</hi> upon this Controverſy between that Univerſity and Mr. <hi>Rawlie,</hi> as he is therein call'd, for the Nomination of Vintners, and ſetting the Price of Wine there; which Opinion is as follows—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Firſt, touching the Nomination of Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners there, we think it appertaineth to the Univerſity, by Uſage and Charters from her Majeſty, confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that Mr. <hi>Rawlie</hi> can nominate none there.

            <p>The Parliament being ſoon after, on the 29th of <hi>March</hi> 1585, prorogued, <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears ſeveral Ways engag'd in the laudable Improvements of Navigation. For his Brother <hi>Adrian Gilbert</hi> of <hi>Sandridge,</hi> afterwards knighted, in Purſuance of the Arguments laid down by his Brother Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> having been at great Charges in finding out the Northern Paſſage to <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Moluccas;</hi> and in Conſideration thereof been granted a Patent by the Queen two Years before this Time, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Diſcovery by Partners, under the Title of <hi>The Colleagues of the Fellowſhip for the Diſcovery of the North-weſt Paſſage; Ralegh</hi> was now one of the Aſſociates in this Enterprize; and after having duly conſulted about the likelieſt Means to Succeſs, and liberally contributed towards the Expence, they choſe Captain <hi>John Davis,</hi> an experienced Navigator, to be Undertaker of the Exploit. He ſet firſt out upon it this Summer from <hi>Falmouth</hi> in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0181500200:59"/>
two Barks. When he came to Land ſixty-ſix Degrees forty Minutes Latitude, he anchor'd in a very fair Road, under a brave Mountain; which, for the ſplendid Appearance it made, the Cliffs thereof being as orient as Gold, they named <hi>Mount Ralegh,</hi> in Honour of their Proprietor; and ſoon after fell into the very Paſſage they ſought, ſince well known by the Name of <hi>Davis's Streights.</hi> The farther Search whereof, through the ſame Patronage and Support, Captain <hi>Davis</hi> made in two Voyages more, the two following Years, and in a Manner compleated the ſaid Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>But about two Months before <hi>Davis</hi> begun his ſaid firſt Voyage for this Diſcovery, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſent out his own Fleet for <hi>Virginia,</hi> which conſiſted of ſeven Sail, whereof ſome were his own Ships, and they departed from <hi>Plymouth</hi> on the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> the Year above ſpecified. He deputed his gallant Relation Sir <hi>Richard Greenville</hi> General of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and Mr. <hi>Ralph Lane,</hi> who was afterwards knighted, to be Governor of the Colony, which they now tranſported. There went beſides, Mr. <hi>Thomas Candiſh, John Arundel, Raymond, Stucley, Bremige, Vincent,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Clark,</hi> and ſeveral others, whereof ſome were Captains, and others Aſſiſtants for Council and Direction in the Voyage. So they ſhaped their Courſe to the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, from thence to <hi>Dominica,</hi> and to the Iſland of St. <hi>John de Puerto Rico,</hi> where they were ſadly ſtung with the <hi>Muſketoes,</hi> and near which they took two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frigats; one whereof was freighted with a rich Cargo, and divers <hi>Spaniards</hi> of Diſtinction, who afterwards were ranſom'd for good round Sums of Money. Then they made away to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> ſoon after which the General, and ſome of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, were near being caſt away in catching of

Coming at laſt to Anchor to <hi>Hato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſk;</hi> Prince <hi>Grangino,</hi> or <hi>Granganimeo,</hi> before mentioned, came attended by <hi>Manteo</hi> to viſit them on board the Admiral, which was named the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> The Particulars which paſſed between them about the Settlement are not mentioned in the ſhort Journal of this Voyage; but we may conclude it was agreed on to their mutual Satisfaction, ſince one hundred and ſeven Men, whoſe Names are printed at the End of the ſaid Journal, under the

Government of Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> were left for a Year in the Country, without Diſturbance, to begin the Plantation. On the 25th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the General weighed Anchor, and ſet Sail for <hi>England;</hi> about ſix Days after he took a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ton, richly laden; and on the 18th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> arrived with the Prize at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where he was courteouſly received by his worſhipful Friend.</p>
            <p>An End having been put to the <hi>Munſter</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion by Force of Arms, and the Country further laid deſolate by a raging Famine, which devour'd what the Sword had left, except a few who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Cities, fled to <hi>England,</hi> or could feed upon Weeds and Carrion, ſo as even to rob the Graves and the Gibbets of the Dead, to keep the dying alive; the Queen ſoon became deſirous of repeopling the Country, and to have Ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on, how the late Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s large Territories in <hi>Ireland</hi> might be diſpoſed of to the Advantage of her and her Subjects. After Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were ſent over for this Purpoſe, and proper Methods taken to prevent frudulent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances by the Rebels, there was at laſt a Scheme reſolv'd on for the Plantation of <hi>Munſter;</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Fenton</hi> carried over the Inſtructions towards the latter End of this Year. The whole Forfeiture was above 574,000 Acres of Land; and after ſome Reſtitutions had been made, the Remainder was divided into <hi>Seigniories</hi> among certain <hi>Gentleman-undertakers,</hi> as they were called; but chiefly ſuch as had been inſtrumental in appeaſing the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion. One of the largeſt Diviſions, which was twelve thouſand Acres, ſituate in the Counties of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> was given by her Majeſty to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and his Heirs, with certain Privileges and Immunities, upon thoſe Conditions of planting and improving the ſame, to which the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0181500200:62"/>
reſt were alſo obliged. And tho' many of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers</hi> did not people their <hi>Seigniories</hi> with well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but ſold them to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts, or otherwiſe to their Profit; nor fortified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Covenants; nor forbore encroaching upon the Lands of the loyal and protected <hi>Iriſh</hi> (as the Crown on the other Side fail'd of maintaining certain Forces promis'd for their Security from freſh Invaſions;) yet I meet with none of thoſe Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities objected to <hi>Ralegh;</hi> on the contrary, that he peopled his Plantation unexceptionably; that he kept the ſaid Eſtate to the latter End of the Queen's Reign, and then ſold it to <hi>Richard Boyle,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the famous Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> as, in a Memorial of his own Life, the ſaid Earl has related. But as capacious as this Benefit ſeemed, it was rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive perhaps at firſt, than profitable to him.</p>
            <p>For Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil,</hi> who, at his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Virginia,</hi> had promiſed the Colony he left behind to return punctually with Supplies by the following <hi>Eaſter</hi> at furtheſt, was not altogether ſo expeditious as they expected; probably through ſome Difficulties attending the Charge thereof, which <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s new Undertaking of planting alſo that Seigniory might probably render more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. <hi>Greenvil</hi> brought over Letters from Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Lane</hi> to a very worthy Encourager of all naval Adventurers; deſcribing the Commodities and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Country they were about to cultivate and civilize; the ſaid Governor alſo drew up Notes while he was there, which he afterwards metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized into a Diſcourſe of two Parts, diſplaying the <hi>Particularities of the Country of</hi> Virginia, <hi>and the Reaſons which moved their Departure from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> England. In this Diſcourſe we learn, that their Diſcovery for Sir <hi>Walter Ralogh</hi> had extended from <hi>Roanoak</hi> ſouthward, as far as <hi>Secotum,</hi> abovt eighty

Miles; Northward as far as the <hi>Cheſepians,</hi> being a hundred and thirty Miles more; and to the North weſt, as far as <hi>Chawanook,</hi> a hundred and thirty Miles; and further mentions many Towns about the Water-ſide, diſcovered by the Way. It alſo informs us of his Enquiries after a Fiſhery and Traffick for Pearl in thoſe Parts; beſides a Mine of ſtrange Metal like Copper, but paler and ſofter; moreover, of the taking Prince <hi>Skyco</hi> Priſoner; and after the Death of <hi>Granganimeo</hi> aforeſaid, how his Brother King <hi>Wingina</hi> changed his Name, and plotted an Inſurrection againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for which he loſt his Life; while another King called <hi>Okiſco,</hi> ſent to pay Homage and acknowledge Subjection to the grand <hi>Weroanza,</hi> or Queen of <hi>England;</hi> and after her, to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Hereupon <hi>Drake</hi> readily proffer'd them all Manner of Supplies, by Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, Men, Ammunition, and Ships, to carry on and compleat their worthy Undertaking. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor deſired only a Ship, and ſo much Proviſion as about <hi>Auguſt</hi> would carry him and his Company to <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>Drake</hi> granted in full Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; beſides Pinnaces, Boats, and two expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Maſters or Pilots, to abide with them, and apply themſelves earneſtly in the Action. All this was performed in two Days. On the next Day,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0181500200:64"/>
while ſome were writing Letters into <hi>England,</hi> and others relating their Adventures to each other, ſome at Sea, ſome on Shore, there aroſe a moſt violent Tempeſt, which laſted three Days; drove moſt of the Fleet from their Anchors away to Sea, and in them the Proviſions and Maſters aforeſaid, with the chief of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony; who they ſaw no more till they met in <hi>England.</hi> Then <hi>Drake</hi> prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them another Ship; but the reſt of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, who were left behind, all begg'd to go for <hi>England;</hi> to which <hi>Drake</hi> conſenting, took them aboard on the 19th of <hi>July,</hi> and ſet Sail. Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> had in the mean Time provided a Ship of a hundred Ton, freighted with all Kind of Proviſions in a moſt plentiful Manner, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this Colony; but not ſailing till after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the ſaid Colony was newly departed before this freſh Supply arrived at <hi>Virginia.</hi> After ſome Time ſpent upon the Country, in ſeeking the Colony and not finding it, they returned with all the Proviſion aforeſaid into <hi>England.</hi> About a Fortnight after, Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> arrived at <hi>Virginia</hi> with three Ships more, well ſtored for the ſame Company of Planters; but he, after much Search, miſſing alſo of them and of the aforeſaid Ship, left fifteen Men at <hi>Roanoak</hi> with Plenty of Supplies, and made for <hi>England;</hi> and not without ſome Conqueſts over the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the <hi>Azores</hi> in his Return. And indeed <hi>Ralegh</hi> was alſo about this very Time victorious at the ſame Place; for, when he ſent the aforeſaid Ship to relieve the Colony, or ſoon after, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched two more, named the <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>Mary-Spark,</hi> both of them his own, to the <hi>Azores</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> under the Conduct of Captain <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Whiddon, John Eveſham,</hi> and others. They departed from <hi>Plymouth</hi> on the 10th of <hi>June</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and took more <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes than they

could bring home. In one of them was the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Iſland; in another, which they took near the Iſle of <hi>Gracioſa,</hi> was the famous <hi>Pedro de Sarmiento,</hi> Governor of the Streights of <hi>Magellan;</hi> who was the furtheſt and moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Navigator in all <hi>Spain.</hi>

There are ſome pleaſant Stories of this Plant, with Relation to him, which have been as carefully preſerved as the Box he kept it in. <note n="†" place="bottom">Being at <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> ſoon after Mr. <hi>Ralph Thoreſhy</hi> the Antiquary died, <hi>Anno</hi> 1725. I ſaw his <hi>Muſaeum;</hi> and in it, among his other Rarities, what himſelf has publickly call'd (in the Catalogue thereof, annex'd to his Antiquities of that Town) Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Tobacco box. From the beſt of my Memory, I can reſemble its outward Appearance to nothing more nearly than one of our modern Muff-caſes; about the ſame Height and Width, covered with red Leather, and opened at Top (but with a Hinge, I think) like one of thoſe. In the Inſide, there was a Cavity for a Receiver of Glaſs or Metal, which might hold half a Pound or a Pound of Tobacco; and from the Edge of the Receiver at Top, to the Edge of the Box, a circular Stay or Collar, with Holes in it to plant the Tobacco about, with ſix or eight Pipes to ſmoke it in. This travelling Box, with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, Medals, and other Rarities in its Company, deſcending to a young Clergyman, the Son of the deceaſed, was ſoon after reported to have been tranſlated to <hi>London.</hi>
               </note>But the Tradition of <hi>Ralegh's ſmoaking Tobacco at firſt privately in his Study, and of the Servant, who uſed to wait on him there, ſurpriſing him one Time with his Tankard of Ale and Nutmeg as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon his Book, before he had done his Pipe; and ſeeing the Smoke reeking out of his Mouth, threw all the Ale in his Face, then running down Stairs alarmed the Family with repeated Exclamations, that</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0181500200:67"/>
his Maſter was on Fire, and before they could get up would be burnt to Aſhes. This I ſay, if true, has nothing in it of more ſurpriſing or unparallel'd Simplicity, than there was in that poor <hi>Norwegian,</hi> who upon the firſt Sight of <hi>Roſes</hi> could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to touch, tho' he ſaw them grow, being ſo amazed to behold Trees budding with Fire: Or, to come cloſer by Way of Retaliation, than there was in thoſe <hi>Virginians</hi> themſelves, who, the firſt Time they ſeized upon a Quantity of Gunpowder which belonged to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony, ſowed it for Grain, or the Seed of ſome ſtrange Vegetable in the Earth, with full Expectation of reaping a plentiful Crop of Combuſtion by the next Harveſt to ſcatter their Enemies.</p>
            <p>But paſſing over theſe Tales; as <hi>Ralegh</hi> was the firſt, who brought this Herb in Requeſt among us, and laid the Foundation for that great Traffick therewith, which has been of ſuch conſiderable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to his Country; there is no leſs Honour due to him than has been conferred on that Ambaſſador, who had before brought it out of <hi>Portugal</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> where, in mentioning the Herb, they pay grateful Acknowledgments to the Importer, by calling it <hi>Nicotiana,</hi> after his own Name: Nay, his politick Sovereign <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> did ſo zealouſly encourage the Uſe of it, that it was alſo afterwards in Honour of her called the <hi>Queen's Herb.</hi> Nor was the Queen of <hi>England</hi> backward in liſtening to, and promoting the Advantages it was promiſed to produce. We may gather from ſome Authors, that ſhe was very curious to know its Virtues and Properties; and that once conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Ralegh</hi> upon this Subject, <hi>He aſſured her Majeſty he had ſo well experienced the Nature of it, that he could tell her of what Weight, even the Smoke would be in any Quantity propoſed to be conſumed.</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0181500200:68"/>
               <hi>Her Majeſty fixing her Thoughts upon the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable Part of the Experiment, that of bounding the Smoke in a Ballance, ſuſpected that he put the Traveller upon her, and would needs lay him a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he could not ſolve the Doubt: So he procured a Quantity agreed upon to be thoroughly ſmoked; then went to weighing; but it was of the Aſhes; and in the Concluſion, what was wanting in the prime Weight of the Tobacco, her Majeſty did not deny to have been evaporated in Smoke; and further ſaid,</hi> that many Labourers in the Fire ſhe had heard of who turned their Gold into Smoke, but <hi>Ralegh,</hi> was the firſt who had turned Smoke into Gold. Whether thoſe two Queens did ever recommend the Uſe of this Herb by their own Example, we are not certain; but it is evident, it ſoon became of ſuch Vogue in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Court, that ſome of the great Ladies, as well as Noblemen therein, would not ſcruple to take a Pipe ſometimes very ſociably; however, it was ſuch an Abomination to the refined Palate of her <hi>Scotch</hi> Succeſſor, that he not only refuſed the Uſe of it himſelf, but endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rob his Crown of what has ſince proved one of its greateſt Revenues, <note n="*" place="bottom">An Author of Experience has lately informed us; <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That the Benefit of this Vegetable to <hi>Great Britain</hi> is prodigious, if we conſider the ſhort Time ſince it was firſt introduced into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> 'Tis now become, ſays he, the Staple of two of his Majeſty's Colonies, inhabited by half a Million of People; many of whom could hardly ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Home; yet there they live in great Splendor and Eaſe; having ſumptuous Buildings, rich Equipages, Slaves and other Attendance.

               <hi>I remember to have met with a ſcarce old Tract in the</hi> Lambeth <hi>Library, written by a learned and ingenious Author of thoſe Times; he adds:</hi> Yet you, more reſpecting the good Ends whereunto you le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled your Line for the Good of your Country, did not give over 'till you had recovered a Land, and had made a Plantation of the People of your own <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony that was ever planted there; not a little to the Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Glory and Impeachment to their Vaunts, who, becauſe, with all cruel Immanity, they ſubdued a naked and yielding People, whom they ſought for Gain, and not for Religion or the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Common-wealth, over whom, to ſatisfy their inſatiable Covetouſneſs, they did moſt cruelly tyranniſe, and againſt the Courſe of all human Nature ſcorch and roaſt them to Death, as by their own Hiſtories doth appear. Theſe, I ſay, do brag and vaunt, that they only have drawn ſtrange Nations and unknown People to the Obedience of their Kings, to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0181500200:72"/>
of Chriſtianity, and to the enriching of their Country; and thereby claim the Honour to themſelves alone. But if theſe your Actions were well looked into and with due Conſideration, it ſhall be found much more honourable in ſundry Reſpects for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Name of God, the Honour of the Prince, and the Benefit of the Common-wealth. For what can be more pleaſant to God, than to gain and reduce, in all Chriſtian-like Manner, a loſt People to the Knowledge of the Goſpel and a true Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than which cannot be a more pleaſant and ſweet Sacrifice, and a more acceptable Service before God? And what can be more honourable to Princes, than to enlarge the Bounds of their Kingdoms, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Wrong and Bloodſhed, and to frame them from a ſavage Life to a civil Government, neither of which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Conqueſts have performed? And what can be more beneficial to a Common-wealth, than to have a Nation and a Kingdom to transfer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the ſuperfluous Multitude of fruitleſs and idle People (here, at Home, daily increaſing) to travel, conquer, and manure another Land, which, by the due Intercourſes to be deviſed, may and will yield in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Commodities? And how well you do deſerve every Way, in following ſo honourable a Courſe, not we ourſelves only can witneſs, but ſtrange Nations alſo do honour you for the ſame; as doth appear by the Epiſtle of <hi>Baſſimerus</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to the Hiſtory of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi> and by <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Epiſtle to his Book, intitled <hi>Columbeados. To this we may here add the Teſtimony of</hi> Camden; <hi>who, ſpeaking of this Undertaking of</hi> Virginia, <hi>at the Return of the laſt Colony ſent thither by Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>ſays,</hi> He was a Man never to be ſufficiently commended for the great Pains he took in diſcovering remote Countries, and advancing the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navigation.</p>

That <hi>Baffimerus</hi> was the learned <hi>Martine Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> as I find elſewhere, with whom <hi>Richard Hakluyt,</hi> the worthy Collector of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Adventures, being acquainted, and having procured a very valuable Hiſtory in Manuſcript of the firſt Diſcovery of <hi>Florida</hi> about 20 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Time, by <hi>Rene Laudonniere</hi> and three other <hi>French</hi> Captains, he ſent it over to that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Baſſaniere,</hi> who publiſhed it from the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Copy, this Year at <hi>Paris,</hi> and dedicated it as aforeſaid to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> who, as appears above, is therein celebrated, for I have not yet ſeen, though I have been promiſed, that original <hi>French</hi> Edition. But it was tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Year following by <hi>Richard Hakluyt</hi> himſelf, who alſo dedicates it anew to the ſame Patron: And indeed we find <hi>Ralegh</hi> from this Time a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Patron of learned and ingenious Authors, not only in Hiſtory and Geography, but Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Chymiſtry, Poetry, and other polite Branches of Art and Science; for Admiral <hi>Coligny</hi> having ſent over with the aforeſaid Diſcoverers of <hi>Florida,</hi> a very ſkilful Artiſt from <hi>France,</hi> to take Draughts of whatever he found obſervable and worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation in the ſaid Country: which he did, not only among the animal and vegetable Rarities thereof, but alſo, it ſeems, from the Cuſtoms of the Natives and hiſtorical Events among the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers themſelves: This Painter living afterwards in <hi>London,</hi> at, or before the Publication of thoſe Diſcoveries; was ſupported by <hi>Ralegh</hi> in the great Expence of publiſhing alſo his Draughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.

            <p>I apprehend, there was a greater Propriety in the Publiſher's Choice of this Patron to that Work, than is now commonly known; for I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where met with Hints, that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was a great Proficient in Muſick, either vocal, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or both; whence we might be ſomewhat induced to conſtrue ſome Lines of <hi>Spenſer</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, hereafter quoted, in the literal Senſe.</p>

that <hi>Leiceſter</hi> ſet him up a Competitor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ralegh,</hi> as we are before informed out of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton.</hi> But <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> as great as his Power was, could no more bridle the licentious Reflections of the Populace than <hi>Ralegh;</hi> an Inſtance whereof we have from ſome antient Authority it ſeems, tho' in a modern Author, who ſpeaking of <hi>Tarleton, the beſt Comedian of theſe Times in</hi> England, <hi>tells us, that when a pleaſant Play he had made was acting before her Majeſty, he pointed at Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> See the Knave commands the Queen; <hi>for which ſhe corrected him with a Frown; yet he had the Confidence to add, that he was of too much and too intolerable a Power; and going on with the ſame Liberty, he reflected on the over great Power and Riches of the Earl of</hi> Leiceſter; <hi>which was ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally applauded by all who were preſent, that ſhe thought fit at that Time to bear theſe Reflections with</hi>

               <hi>a ſeeming Unconcernedneſs; but yet was ſo offended, that ſhe forbad</hi> Tarleton <hi>and all her Jeſters from coming near her Table, being inwardly diſpleaſed with this impudent and unreaſonable Liberty. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> ſeems to have little regarded theſe Aſperſions, but conſtantly attended his publick Charge and Employments, whether in Town or Country as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion called him. Accordingly we find him the latter End of this Year in Parliament, where, among other weighty Concerns, the Fate of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was determined. There is nothing particular upon Record in the Journals of the Houſe of Commons of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Opinion in this Matter, nor indeed any Debates upon the Sentence that had been pronounced againſt that Queen. For on the 12th of <hi>November,</hi> a Petition agreed upon in both Houſes was preſented to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the Speaker <hi>Puckering,</hi> the Privy-council, and a Body of the Commons, joined with the Lord Chancellor <hi>Bromley</hi> and twenty other temporal Lords, for the ſpeedy Execution of the ſaid Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> in Conſideration of the treaſonable and rebellious Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices wherewith ſhe had been proved to endanger this Realm and its Ruler. The ſaid Petition was immediately printed, and that Queen in leſs than three Months after executed. He was appointed one of the Committee to confer upon the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome Things, whereunto the Clergy were required to be ſworn, and that ſome good Courſe might be taken to have a learned Miniſtry; for the Queen had in her Speech at the Cloſe of the laſt Seſſions told the Biſhops of ſome Faults and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, <hi>which if you, my Lords of the Clergy,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>do not amend, I mean to depoſe you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ralegh,</hi> reſolving to perſevere in planting his Country of <hi>Virginia,</hi> prepared a new Colony of one hundred and fifty Men to be ſent thither, under
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0181500200:78"/>
the Charge of Mr. <hi>John White,</hi> whom he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governor, and with him twelve Aſſiſtants, to whom he gave a Charter, and incorporated them by the Name of the Governor and Aſſiſtants of the City of <hi>Ralegh</hi> in <hi>Virginia.</hi> Their Fleet, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three Sail, departed from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> on the 26th of <hi>April,</hi> 1587, and in leſs than three Months following arrived ſafe at <hi>Hatoraſk,</hi> from whence they went to the Iſle of <hi>Roanoak</hi> to look for the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Men left there by Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> the Year before, meaning from thence to paſs to the Bay of <hi>Cheſepiock,</hi> where they intended to make their Seat and Fort, according to the Charge given them by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> But when they came to the North part of the Iſland where Governor <hi>Lane</hi> had bu lt his Fort, they found it razed, and the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms of the Dwelling-houſes, which had been alſo erected about it, inhabited by Deer, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with Melons, or ſuch like Sort of Fruit, which thoſe Animals broozed upon. At <hi>Croatoan</hi> they were very well received and entertained by the Natives, thro' the Means of <hi>Manteo</hi> their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Of theſe they learnt, that the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> they were ſeeking, had been treacherouſly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Party of the Savages, who wounded ſome of them, and drove the reſt to ſome remote and obſcure Parts of the Country. On the 13th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> their Friend <hi>Manteo</hi> was, according to the Commands of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> chriſtned in <hi>Roanoak,</hi> and called Lord thereof, and of <hi>Daſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monguepeuk,</hi> in Reward of his faithful Services. Three Days after, the Governor's Daughter <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> Wife of <hi>Ananias Dare,</hi> one of the Aſſiſtants, was delivered of a Daughter in <hi>Roanoak;</hi> and the Infant was chriſtned there the Sunday following, who, becauſe ſhe was the firſt <hi>Creolian</hi> or Chriſtian born in that Country, was baptized by the Name
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0181500200:79"/>
of <hi>Virginia.</hi> Now having re-eſtabliſhed their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Alliance with the Natives, as far as this ſhort Interview would permit, and delivered their Ships of the Proviſions for the Colony, the Planters began to conſider, they ſhould be in Want of freſh Supplies; therefore upon ſome Difference about chooſing a Factor to return for that Purpoſe into <hi>England,</hi> they unanimouſly petitioned the Governor to return himſelf, to which he at laſt conſented, and the Ships with ſome few of the Company arrived in <hi>England,</hi> not without Storms, Sickneſs, and the Death of ſeveral of them by other like Caſualties, about the latter End of the ſame Year.</p>
            <p>It was but five Days after the going forth of this ſecond Colony, that Mr. <hi>Richard Hakluyt</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his Tranſlation of the Voyages to <hi>Florida,</hi> before mentioned, to the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> as he ſtiles him, Captain of her Majeſty's Guard, Lord-warden of the Stannaries, and her Highneſs's Lieutenant-general of the County of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> In this Dedication it will ſomewhat appear, that neither the Returns, which might have been made by any merchantable Products in <hi>Virginia,</hi> nor the Profits ariſing to him from any <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes, which had been taken at Sea, were equivalent to the great Expences he had been at, in ſettling this Plantation; and further, that he had received no particular or private Aſſiſtance in this Enterprize from the Queen, becauſe his Hopes therein, and her Majeſty's Regard thereof, are ſo handſomely excited by the ſaid Author. <note n="†" place="bottom">Here this Author illuſtrates his Addreſs by theſe Examples; <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their firſt Entrance into <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> found neither Sugar-canes nor Ginger growing there, nor any King of our Cattle; but finding the Place fit for Paſture, they ſent Kine and Bulls, and ſundry other profitable Beaſts thither, and tranſported the Plants of Sugar-canes, and ſet the Roots of Ginger; the Hides of which Oxen, with the Sugar and Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, are now the chief Merchandize of that Iſland.

But the Ships, in which this ſecond Colony was tranſported, had not been many Days returned into <hi>England,</hi> before we find <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Thoughts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, for a while, from planting in a foreign Country, and engaged upon Schemes of diſplanting rather thoſe powerful Enemies who were preparing to root themſelves in his own. For the Rumour grew ſtronger every Day of ſuch a mighty Fleet threatning us, as if all <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were to land upon our little Iſland, and over-run the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Queen and her Privy-council therefore no longer delayed all proper Means for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Realm; but out of all her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders by Land and Sea appointed thoſe of moſt approved Abilities in naval and military Affairs, as well as of the greateſt Authority in their reſpective Counties, to hold Conſultations for the Security of her Perſon, her People, and their Poſſeſſions. And as there were ſuch Conſultations diſtinctly held by the moſt ancient and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders at Sea; ſo we find by the like Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Council of War alſo held on the 27th of <hi>November</hi> this Year, by others of higheſt Repute for their Knowledge, how to put the Forces of the Realm in the beſt Order, to withſtand any Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by Land.

Sir, <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Greenvil,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Lane,</hi> Eſq; Of their Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in this important Council I have a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript drawn up perhaps by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> himſelf; the ſaid Draught being annexed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manuſcript now before me, which was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of his compoſing.</p>
            <p>Beſides this grand Scheme for the Safeguard of the Kingdom in general, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſeems to have had ſome ſpecial Regard to ſeveral particular Places. For there has been found among the Lord <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Papers, <hi>a Remembrance for the Lord-treaſurer, touching the Requeſt of</hi> Sir <hi>W. R.</hi> dated it ſeems this Year; which makes Requeſt for five Pieces of Braſs Cannon lying at <hi>Woolwich;</hi> alſo for Letters to the Marquis of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> for a hundred Men and Arms to defend the Caſtle and Iſland of <hi>Portland,</hi> with a Supply of Powder, there being but one <hi>laſt.</hi> Further, for Removal of the unſerviceable Ordnance there to <hi>London;</hi> and that the Lord Marquis would give Order for his ſaid hundred Men, by his Commiſſion directed to the Lieutenant of <hi>Portland;</hi> and he will undertake to collect Men of Sufficiency, not of the trained Number. Laſtly, for his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's good Remembrance for the Towns of <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and <hi>Melcomb-Regis.</hi> From whence my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is not only inclined to believe this Paper was ſent by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> but that he was now Governor of <hi>Portland</hi> Caſtle, and had thoſe Towns under his Care. We may indeed hence believe this Paper was written by him; and that he not only took thoſe Places, but ſeveral others, under his Conſideration, that they might be put in the beſt State of Defence; but that he was now Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Portland</hi> Caſtle, or limited to the Defence
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0181500200:82"/>
of that Place at the Time of the Invaſion, as might be imply'd from my Author, ſeems not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his Lieutenancy in the Weſt.</p>
            <p>But as much engaged as <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſeems at this Time to have been for the Safety of the Kingdom, he found ſome Interval to conſider alſo upon Means for the Relief of his Colony; for after Governor <hi>White</hi> returned, and had delivered him his Letters, with other Advertiſements concerning his late Voyage, and the State of the Planters in <hi>Virginia, Ralegh</hi> immediately appointed a Pinnace to be ſent thither, with all ſuch Proviſions as he apprehended they might want; and alſo wrote Letters to them, promiſing that he would prepare a good Supply of Shipping and Men, with all other Neceſſaries, to be with them the Summer following. This Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace and Fleet he accordingly prepared at <hi>Biddeford</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil;</hi> and all Things being now ready, they waited only for a fair Wind. In the mean Time, the Alarm ſo increas'd throughout all <hi>England,</hi> of that vaſt and formidable Armament made by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Sanction of the Pope's <hi>Cruſado,</hi> for the Invaſion and Conqueſt of the whole Iſland; that moſt of the Ships of War then in any Readineſs, received Orders from the State to attend in their Harbours for the Defence of their own Country; and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> was perſonally commanded not to depart out of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> Governor <hi>White</hi> nevertheleſs labour'd ſo earneſtly for the Relief of the Colony, that he obtain'd two ſmall Pinnaces, called the <hi>Brave</hi> and the <hi>Roe,</hi> wherein fifteen Planters, and all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Proviſions for thoſe who winter'd in the Country, were tranſported; but the Names of the Captains who commanded thoſe Veſſels are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd. On the 22d of <hi>April</hi> 1588, they put
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0181500200:83"/>
over the Bar at <hi>Biddeford,</hi> and the ſame Night came to Anchor at the Iſle of <hi>Lundy;</hi> but the Company, minding more to make a gainful Voyage than a ſafe one, run in Chaſe of Prizes; 'till at laſt one of them was met with by a Couple of ſtrong Men of War of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> about 50 Leagues to the North-Eaſt of <hi>Madera;</hi> where, after a bloody Fight, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were beaten, boarded and rifled. But it is obſervable, the <hi>French</hi> Men were ſo immoderate in poſſeſſing themſelves of their Spoil, that, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading the Boats with the Freight of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, they ſunk what they were too eager to ſhare. In this maimed, ranſacked and ragged Condition, the ſaid Ship returned to <hi>England</hi> in a Month's Time; and about three Weeks after returned the other, having perhaps taſted of the ſame Fare; at leaſt without performing the intended Voyage; to the Diſtreſs of the Planters abroad, and Diſpleaſure of their Patron at home.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time the King of <hi>France</hi> ſent Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Meſſage, aſſuring her, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, which had been gathering in <hi>Spain</hi> for three Years, would certainly break very ſpeedily upon her Kingdom; therefore adviſed her to make the beſt Preparation ſhe could for its Defence. Nor did the King of <hi>Spain</hi> keep it now any longer a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, having this Year, publiſhed at <hi>Liſbon</hi> an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and oſtentatious Account of this <hi>Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves had called it; wherein it appears the whole Fleet conſiſted of 130, or, according to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and <hi>Hugo Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> 140 Sail; ſome few Tenders, or others, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by the Way, not being perhaps in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Liſt reckoned: Carrying, by the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Accounts, above 2600 Pieces of Braſs and Iron Ordnance; near 19000 Soldiers; between 8 and 9000 Sailors, beſides Officers, Prieſts, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-ſlaves,

Nor were they idle in <hi>England;</hi> for how well the Directions of the Council of War aforeſaid were put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and how far <hi>Ralegh</hi> may be preſumed to have been engaged among the moſt indefatigable in this Service, is to be inferr'd from the Words of that Author, who ſays, <hi>In a very ſhort Time the whole Kingdom and every Corner were ſpeedily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with armed People on Horſeback and on Foot; and thoſe continually trained, exerciſed, and put into Bands in ſuch warlike Manner, as in no Age ever was before in this Realm.</hi> And a little further, <hi>That all concurred in one Mind, to be in Readineſs to ſerve for the Realm; and ſome one Country was able to make a ſufficient Army of</hi> 20,000 <hi>Men fit to fight, and</hi> 15000 <hi>of them well armed and weaponed: And in ſome Countries the Number of</hi> 40,000 <hi>able Men: That the maritime Countries from</hi> Cornwal <hi>all along ſouthward to</hi> Kent, <hi>and from thence Eaſtward to</hi> Lincolnſhire, <hi>were ſo furniſhed with Soldiers, both of themſelves, and with Reſort from their next Shires, as there was no Place to be doubted for landing of any</hi>

For tho' that Liſt raiſes their Number beyond all other Accounts, to 197 Sail (manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitting ſome which were there, and probably admitting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral which were not;) yet there are not above ſix Ships among them mentioned to be of 500 Ton, and not above ſeven of greater Burden.</note>The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0181500200:88"/>
               <hi>Invincible Armada</hi> looſed Anchor from <hi>Liſbon</hi> four Days before; but met with ſuch Storms, Sickneſs, and other Diſaſters, that the Lord-admiral put forth towards <hi>Spain,</hi> in Hopes of ſurpriſing them in their Diſtreſs; till more maturely conſidering they might paſs by undiſcover'd, he return'd to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and ſuffer'd his Men to relieve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on Shore. The Queen had received ſuch Aſſurance they were ſo diſabled from coming this Year by that Storm, that ſhe made Secretary <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham</hi> ſend for four of her firſt-rate Ships to be brought home to <hi>Chatham.</hi> But their Return was prevented by the Intelligence which Captain <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fleming</hi> brought into the Harbour on the 19th of <hi>July,</hi> that he had diſcovered the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching from the <hi>Lizard-Point</hi> in <hi>Cornwal.</hi> The Captains and Commanders were then it ſeems at Bowls upon the <hi>Hoe</hi> at <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goes, that <hi>Drake</hi> would needs ſee the Game up, but was ſoon prevailed on to go and play out the Rubbers with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> All Hands were now at Work to warp out the Ships, which, with the admirable Induſtry of the Seamen, was very ſpeedily perform'd, the Wind blowing ſtiffly into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the South-weſt. The Lord-admiral, with the few he could then get ready, lay all Night in the Road. Next Day about fifty or threeſcore more join'd him, and at Noon they ken'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet; ſome with lofty Turrets and Decks rear'd one above another; and others rowed along with two or three hundred Oars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; all advancing with their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gravity, the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0181500200:89"/>
Wind being abated, in a ſemicircular Order; and extended ſeven Miles from End to End. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuffered them all to paſs by, ſo got the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Wind, when they began to chaſe them in the Rear; nor did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> offer to land at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> their Commiſſion being to join the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and ſail directly to <hi>London.</hi> The next Day, which was the 21ſt of <hi>July,</hi> the Lord-admiral ſent out a Pinnace call'd the <hi>Defiance,</hi> and begun the Fight. This, I take it, was near the <hi>Eddiſtone;</hi> for there we have Account of the firſt Conflict, and of the firſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship that was taken or ſunk. Then the Lord-admiral in the <hi>Ark-Royal, Drake</hi> in the <hi>Revenge,</hi> with <hi>Hawkins, Frobiſher,</hi> and others, having thunder'd thick upon the Enemy for two Hours together, withdrew, 40 of their Ships not being yet come up. In this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by endeavouring to circle in and ſhelter one of their diſabled Galleons, ſhe had her Foremaſt broken, and was left behind, which <hi>Drake</hi> took the next Day, with <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez</hi> and other Nobles in her, beſides 55000 Ducats, which were ſhared among his Sailors. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, another of their greateſt Ships was ſet on Fire, with all the People in her, and yet the Powder eſcaped. But how the Lord-Admiral, all the firſt Night, followed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lanthern, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Drake</hi>'s into their Fleet, while <hi>Drake</hi> at the ſame Time was making another miſtaken Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; and how the <hi>Ark Royal</hi> followed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet alſo the ſecond Night, ſo far, almoſt alone, that it was the Afternoon following before the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Fleet overtook her, with other Particulars; I leave to the more ample Accounts of this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I may attend the Motions of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> who, from being at firſt the neareſt, now growing impatient at being the moſt remote from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0181500200:90"/>
the Enemy, appears to have committed his Charge by Land to proper Officers, or detached Part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to march up nearer the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with a gallant Company of Nobles and Gentlemen, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ships to have join'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; that is to ſay, on the 23d of <hi>July,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet was advanced over againſt <hi>Portland;</hi> where, this whole Day being one continued Engagement from Morning till Night, it proved the moſt general and bloody Fight of any between them in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Channel; and here, after the taking of a great <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship, and others of leſſer Bulk, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were driven from all Intention of aſſaulting the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> till they had joined the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> for during this Fight <hi>the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Navy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd; whereunto, out of all Havens of the Realm reſorted Ships and Men; for they all with one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord came flocking thither (to</hi> Portland) <hi>as unto a ſet Field where immortal Fame and Glory was to be attained, and faithful Service to be performed unto their Prince and Country.</hi> In which Number hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mentioned the Earls of <hi>Oxford, Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> he alſo names Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> among the foremoſt of near 20 other Knights and Gentlemen, whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships were aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to 100 Sail; and doubtleſs by ſome of thoſe <hi>Camden</hi> mention'd to have been left behind in <hi>Plymouth-Sound,</hi> with which <hi>Ralegh</hi> very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly advanced. <note n="*" place="bottom">What further perſuades me to believe <hi>Ralegh</hi> entered the Fleet at this Place and Time is, my having met with a certain foreign Hiſtory, hereafter mentioned, which had been his own Book, and wherein he has with his own Hand corrected other Paſſages relating to himſelf; but has let this of his joining the Fleet, as above, paſs uncontradicted.</note>Theſe, ever aſunder, and always in Motion, were on every ſide uſeful to annoy the Enemy; now preſenting a broad-ſide, and ſheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Now <hi>Ralegh,</hi> having made ſome excellent Animadverſions upon this very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, goes nigh to prove out of his own Words, that he was not only in this Day's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; but that the Counſel he might thence appear to have given, did greatly contribute to the Succeſs of it. He has ſhewn how well he knew, that in ſuch Caſe the advantage of Weapons would be likelieſt to carry it, whereof the Enemy was provided with far the greateſt Number; alſo, that in ſuch cloſe Fight, how liable the leſſer Ships were to be cruſh'd by the greater; that theſe by their very Height muſt have further Advantage over thoſe that endeavour'd to board them from below; and laſtly, in theſe of more bulk and breadth being alſo more firm and more ſteady, thoſe who could beſt keep their Feet would probably be beſt able to uſe their Hands.</p>
            <p>Next Day the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were glad to lie by, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> no leſs pleaſed with the Ceſſation, that they might take the Opportunity of ſending to Shore for a Recruit of Ammunition; and this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Circumſtance taken Notice of alſo by <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, further confirms his having been now

among them. The 25th of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had another ſharp Battel with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral, and the three great Galleaſſes at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in which <hi>Cambden</hi> mentions the taking of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Galleon, and that from this Time the Galleaſſes durſt not venture upon any new Engagement, but cloſing themſelves up again in a Rundel as they called it, made the beſt of their Way to tell the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> how they had been ſerved. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet followed and kept playing upon their Rear all the next Day, having determined to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any cloſer Engagement 'till they came to the <hi>Britiſh Frith,</hi> or Streights of <hi>Calais,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Seymer</hi> expected their Arrival. <hi>But ſo far was this</hi> Invincible Armada <hi>from alarming the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts, ſays</hi> Camden, <hi>that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Gentry of the younger Sort entered themſelves Volunteers, and, leaving their Friends and Families, did with incredible Cheerfulneſs hire Ships at their own Charge, and in pure Love to their Country joined the grand Fleet in vaſt Numbers.</hi> And here <hi>Camden</hi> names thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſome of thoſe Gentlemen, with <hi>Ralegh</hi> among them, which compoſed the Squadron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mention'd, as if it entered but now from <hi>Dover,</hi> or ſome of thoſe Ports; not that he confines their Entrance to this Day, otherwiſe than naming them under it, or any other Way ſuggeſts, they did not join the grand Fleet three Days before; but ſeems, by remembering them in this Place, to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, they were moſt conſpicuous or in greateſt Number at this Time, unleſs he poſtponed the Mention of them to a Day, that was leaſt throng'd with Circumſtances of Action.

the Land, and his Intereſt in ſtrengthning thoſe of the Sea; the Charges he was at, and the Dangers he voluntarily incurr'd, however undiſtinguiſh'd more than is above expreſs'd by our common Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, and thoſe few inaccurate Accounts thereof, which are deſcended to us; were yet received with ſuch Approbation by the Queen, that ſhe ſeems, as ſome Recompence for them, to have this Year made a conſiderable Augmentation to his Patent of Wines; as if he had, beſides the Grant before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, another now alſo beſtowed upon him for Tonnage and Poundage upon thoſe Liquors, except it is the ſame Patent with the former, only renewed this Year, or wrong dated in the Author who mentions it. Be it as it ſhould, this Patent ſeems to have been one of the moſt beneficial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which <hi>Ralegh</hi> ever received of the Queen, and might perhaps exceed in Profit the Penſion which ſhe ſettled on the Lord-Admiral himſelf for his Conduct and Courage in the ſaid Overthrow. This Benefit <hi>Ralegh</hi> enjoy'd as long as ſhe liv'd; though, towards the Cloſe of her Reign, the Number of ſuch-like Grants to others being very much encreaſed, they were inveighed againſt in Parliament as grievous and burdenſome Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, by thoſe eſpecially, who had not the Merit or Intereſt to procure any for themſelves.

this was profitable to him. For one Writer, in the ſhort Account he gives of him, having ſpoken of the Diviſion he made of his Time, in allowing five Hours to ſleep, four to Reading, two for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and the reſt to Buſineſs and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and having hinted at the Diverſity of his Correſpondencies, Intelligence and the like, ſays, that <hi>in the Capacity of an Agency for all Sorts of Perſons, he ſet up a kind of</hi> Office of Addreſs. And further, <hi>that conſidering the Diſpatch of ſuch Variety of Engagements in the former Part of his Life, one muſt be much to ſeek how a Man of ſo many Actions ſhould write any Thing, and one of ſo many Writings ſhould do any Thing.</hi> By another little Hint, that has been elſewhere preſerved, we may conceive this Office did chiefly reſpect a more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intercourſe, a nobler Mutuality of Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than would perhaps admit of all Sorts of Perſons; and ſuch as advanced rather to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Men themſelves, than their Means. But this Suggeſtion is drawn only from comparing it with the general Tendency of thoſe other Schemes, among which I once ſaw it mentioned, in a Letter written by an ingenious Perſon of great Note for his Writings to a Nobleman, who had the greateſt Correſpondence with ſuch Perſons of any in his Time; recommending, <hi>that long dried Fountain of Communication, which</hi> Montaigne <hi>firſt propos'd, Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>put in Practice, and Mr.</hi> Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib <hi>endeavour'd to revive.</hi>

The Queen not only conſented to the Enterpriſe, as thinking it more convenient to return the late Viſit of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in their own Country, than ſuffer them to repeat it here, but lent ſix of her Men of War,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0181500200:100"/>
and diſburſed 60,000 Pounds towards defraying the Charges thereof. This Encouragement, and the late Provocation, ſo ſpirited up the warlike Men of the Kingdom, and <hi>Ralegh</hi> among the reſt to become Volunteers therein, that they augmented the Number of the ſaid Ships with a hundred and twenty Sail more, and mann'd them with fourteen or fifteen thouſand Soldiers and Sailors at their own further Expence, committing the Charge by Sea to Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and that by Land to Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> who were probably the moſt conſiderable Contributors thereto.</p>
            <p>But firſt <hi>Ralegh</hi> took Care for the Relief of his Plantation in <hi>Virginia,</hi> which that he might more effectually ſecure than could be expected from his own ſingle Aſſiſtance, eſpecially after the many heavy Diſburſments he had made, and the great Diſappointment the Colony muſt doubtleſs have received by miſſing of the laſt Supplies he ſent them, through the Loſſes, which his Agents too raſhly brought thereon; he made an Aſſignment to divers Gentlemen and Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> for continuing the Plantation of this new diſcover'd Country with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men. And this was now no leſs adviſedly done with regard to himſelf, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately with reſpect to the People employ'd therein: Whom, though he generouſly aſſiſted with his Advice and Intereſt in ſome future Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of this Undertakings; yet theſe proving improſperous, through the oblique Courſes they took at firſt ſetting out upon this new Foundation, like that in which they lately fail'd, it was twenty Years from this Time, before even a whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany could make a more ſucceſsful and advanced P ogreſs in this Settlement, than Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> of himſelf alone had done; it having coſt him no leſs than 40000<hi>l.</hi>

As for the Expedition before mentioned, which was ſet out under <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Norris,</hi> about five Weeks after the ſaid Aſſignment, that is on the 14th of <hi>April,</hi> 1589, in which <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was by <hi>Ralegh,</hi> among the reſt, accompanied to <hi>Portugal,</hi> we need not here be circumſtantial thereon; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the Action at the <hi>Groine,</hi> the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at <hi>Puente de Burgus,</hi> the taking of <hi>Peniche,</hi> with the Caſtle of <hi>Caſcais,</hi> the Aſſault of <hi>Liſbon,</hi> and the burning of <hi>Vigo;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Hiſtorians have not diſtinguiſhed what Part <hi>Ralegh</hi> had therein: In which perhaps they ſeem not ſo grateful to him as he was to his Aſſociates; but particularly in not mentioning him at the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that great Number of eaſterling Hulks and other Ships laden with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Goods, Proviſions and Ammunition, for a new Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> which from the 2d of <hi>June</hi> ſome or other of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers (none are named) continued to bring into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, then lying in the Road of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cais,</hi> for ſix Days together. This Fleet of ours was but thinly mann'd at firſt, and having loſt ſome thouſands by Sickneſs and Intemperance with the new Wines of thoſe Countries; Hands could not be ſpared to bring home much above a quarter of thoſe Veſſels and their Lading, that were thus taken: For Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> who was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel in the Land-Service of this Expedition, has ſaid in a Letter of his, ſtill extant, <hi>It is well known, we had above two hundred Sail of all Sorts, of which we could not carry with us above threeſcore for the Want of Men.</hi> Hence aroſe at their Return into <hi>England,</hi> a little Contention between <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Ralegh;</hi> for <hi>Ralegh</hi> having taken ſome of theſe Prizes, <hi>Williams</hi> placed in one of them his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with ſome of his Soldiers, <hi>without which,</hi> ſays <hi>Williams, it could not have been carried into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0181500200:102"/>
Wherefore he would have laid Claim, it ſeems, both to the Ship and its Cargo; <hi>this Voyage, as he goes on, having coſt him a Thouſand Pounds,</hi> as it did ſeveral other of the Adventurers no doubt. But his Claim not being thought reaſonable, the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> diſcharged his Men from that Veſſel at <hi>Dartmouth. Williams,</hi> at this, growing very turbulent, and his Clamours reaching the Queen's Ear, procured her Diſpleaſure againſt him, which occaſion'd his ſaid Letter to three of the Privy-Council; whence this Intelligence is extracted. From this Letter we farther collect, the Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Voyage ſo well ſatisfy'd the Queen, in the Diſablement of the Enemy, eſpecially as to their naval Powers, that ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Commanders or chief Adventurers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> among the reſt, with a golden Chain; for Sir <hi>Roger</hi> preſum'd, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (his great Friend, as appears in the Hiſtories of this Expedition) with the reſt who were in the Action, would teſtify, <hi>That I deſerve a Chain as well as my Fellows,</hi> ſay he. As for the coarſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which follows, of <hi>Ralegh's belying his Hulk, as he had done the Ark of</hi> Noah, <hi>the beſt Ship that ever was,</hi> tho' it may betray ſome Impolite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Manners and Impetuoſity of Diſpoſition in Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s Civil Capacity; yet in the Field, and againſt an Enemy, thoſe rougher Qualities might invigorate his Courage and Experience, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the miliary Character of the Man.</p>
            <p>In the latter End of <hi>June</hi> this Year, and ſome Weeks before this Diſpute, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home; but <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears firſt to have touch'd upon the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> probably to make a ſhort Viſit to his Seigniory there, and ſee ſome of his Acquaintance among the new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <l>Keeping my Sheep amongst the cooly Shade</l>

Whom when I aſked from what Place he came,</l>
               <l>And how he hight? himſelf he did ycleep</l>
               <l>The Shepherd of the Ocean <hi>by Name,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ſaid, he came <hi>far from the Main-ſea</hi> deep.</l>
               <l>He ſitting me beſide in that ſame Shade,</l>
               <l>Provoked me to play ſome pleaſant Fit;</l>
               <l>And when he heard the Muſick that I made,</l>
               <l>He found himſelf full greatly pleas'd at it:</l>
               <l>Yet aemuling my Pipe, he took in Hond</l>
               <l>My Pipe, before that aemuled of many,</l>
               <l>And play'd thereon, for well that Skill he con'd;</l>
               <l>Himſelf as ſkilful in that Art as any.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>It further appears, they now entertain'd each other with ſome of their poetical Compoſitions; <hi>Spenſer</hi> rehearſed a pretty Tale he had made of the Amours between ſome of his neighbouring Rivers; but <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Muſe ran upon a more melancholy Strain, which, by the tranſient View it gives of ſome little Cloud he had lately, but undeſervedly, been under at Court, lets us into a Piece of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Hiſtory; where the Poet tells us,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>His Song was all a lamentable Lay,</l>
               <l>Of great Unkindneſs and of Uſage hard,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Cynthia</hi> the Lady of the Sea,</l>
               <l>Which from her Preſence, faultleſs, him debarr'd:</l>
               <l>And ever and anon with <hi>Singults</hi> rife,</l>
               <l>He cried out to make his underſong,</l>
               <l>Ah my Love's Queen, and Goddeſs of my Life!</l>
               <l>Who ſhall me pity, when thou doſt me Wrong?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But it immediately appears to have been ſoon blown over by ſome pathetical Addreſs of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s to the Queen, whereby he was, at this Time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0181500200:106"/>
to her Favour, as we may fully conclude from theſe Words:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—Right well be ſure did' plain,</l>
               <l>That could great <hi>Cynthia's</hi> ſore Diſpleaſure break,</l>
               <l>And move to take him to her Grace again.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And this is confirmed a little further, where, through <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Affection for his Welfare, and his Regret to behold ſo rare a Genius baniſhed to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, and buried in ſuch a State of Obſcurity, he perſuades <hi>Spenſer</hi> to go along with him into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and proffers to introduce him to the Queen. The Poet, knowing his Intereſt, embraced his Offer. Then having given a Deſcription of the Sea, with <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s great Ship, ſuitable to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Character he aſſumes; and having repreſented <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Deſcription of the Flocks and Herds of that <hi>Royal Shepherdeſs,</hi> which were kept upon thoſe watry Hills, under the Charge of <hi>Triton</hi> and <hi>Proteus,</hi> he makes him further ſay:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And I among the reſt, of many leaſt,</l>
               <l>Have in the Ocean Charge to me aſſign'd;</l>
               <l>Where I will live or die at her Beheaſt,</l>
               <l>And ſerve and honour her with faithful Mind.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>He then proceeds to the Progreſs of their Voyage, how they paſſed by the <hi>Iſle of Lundy,</hi> and landed at St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s <hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> ſo took their Journey to the Court, where the Poet having expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on the dazling Preſence of the Queen, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Admiration of a Spectator, in his paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Character, we have this further Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Shepherd of the Ocean, <hi>quoth he,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Unto the Goddeſs<hi>'s</hi> Grace me firſt enhanced:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0181500200:107"/>
And to my oaten Pipe inclined her Ear,</l>
               <l>That ſhe thenceforth therein 'gan take Delight,</l>
               <l>And it deſired, at timely Hours to hear;</l>
               <l>All were my Notes but rude and roughly dight.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This Honour the Poet further magnifies, as the more wond'rous Condeſcenſion in her Majeſty, in that ſhe had ſo many more learned Shepherds about her to glorify her Name. Here he takes an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to give a Character of the ſeveral Poets and Wits then ſhining in her Court: Among the reſt,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>And there that</hi> Shepherd of the Ocean <hi>is,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That ſpends his Wit in Love's conſuming Smart:</l>
               <l>Full ſweetly temper'd is that Muſe of his,</l>
               <l>That can impierce a Prince's mighty Heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>As to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s poetical Talents, we ſhall hear more of them very ſpeedily. In this Place, we muſt purſue his farther Deſign of bringing <hi>Spenſer</hi> over into <hi>England,</hi> which was to make him oblige the Publick with what he had hitherto finiſhed of his capital Work, called the <hi>Fairy Queen.</hi> For, though <hi>Spencer</hi> had begun this grand Poem through the Encouragement of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> before he went over into <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet it was there he ſeems to have writ moſt of what we have in Print; and now, by the Encouragement of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> that he was brought to publiſh the three firſt Books which he had compleated thereof: 'Tis certain he took his Advice in the Publication of them, and particularly in drawing up a Plan to explain or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the general Intention and Meaning of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Poem. This he directed to his ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, <hi>The right noble and valorous Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh, &amp;c. in a letter dated the 23d of <hi>January</hi> this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0181500200:108"/>
Year 1589; concluding with <hi>An humble Requeſt for the Continuance of his honourable Favours, and Wiſhes for the eternal Eſtabliſhment of his Happineſs.</hi> This Letter is printed at the End of the ſaid firſt three Books of that Poem, which were publiſhed at <hi>London</hi> the enſuing Year. Among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory Verſes thereto alſo ſubjoined, the firſt two Copies are both ſaid to be written by Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh,</hi> and not without great Probability, being ſubſcribed with the initial Letters of his Name. The firſt of theſe Copies, written in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate Verſe, is highly poetical; for our Author, Correſpondent with the viſionary Manner of his Author, fancying himſelf in the Temple of the veſtal Virgins, where his Curioſity led him to the Tomb of <hi>Laura,</hi> which was guarded by <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> he was ſuddenly attracted from thence, by the Appearance of the <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> at whoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the <hi>Soul of Petrarch wept;</hi> ſeeing thoſe Graces deſert that Miſtreſs of his, to attend upon this royal Lady, and Oblivion ſupply their Place. The Compliment is ſurely fine, and perhaps the more judiciouſly expreſs'd, in not being bounded more periodically than it is, according to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our modern Criticks in the Structure of Verſification; for being the Recital of one ſolemn and ſurpriſing Thought, it may engage our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more cloſely to the End of the two or three Quadrains it is compris'd in, than if the Author had affected to divide or bound the Senſe with a full Period at the End of every four Lines. But every Reader may eaſily judge for himſelf, the Poem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in moſt Editions of <hi>Spenſer,</hi> and therefore needs not here be recited. His other Verſes upon this Poet are compoſed in a Meaſure more obſolete to the Manner of our Age; but what the Queen her ſelf imitated, in ſome Poetry ſtill to be ſeen of her
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0181500200:109"/>
Writing, being in Lines of ſix and ſeven Feet long. It may be ſufficient therefore to obſerve, there is a diſtinguiſhed Conduct alſo in this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; for the Induction is writ with great Modeſty, in Regard to himſelf.</p>

               <hi>Hence we learn Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>wrote a Poem, call'd CYNTHIA; that it was in Praiſe of the Queen, and that it was not now publiſh'd.</hi> Spenſer, <hi>in his Letter to</hi> Ralegh <hi>above-cited, alſo mentions again ſomething of this Poem, where he ſays,</hi> In that <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> I mean <hi>Glory</hi> in my general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but in my Particular, I conceive the moſt excellent and glorious Perſon of our Sovereign the <hi>Queen,</hi> and her Kingdom, in <hi>Fairy-land.</hi> And yet in ſome Places elſe, I do otherwiſe ſhadow her. For conſidering ſhe beareth two Perſons; the one, of a moſt Royal Queen or Empreſs; the other, of a moſt virtuous and beautiful Lady; this latter Part in ſome Places, I do expreſs in <hi>Belphoebe;</hi> faſhioning her Name according to your own excellent Conceit of <hi>CYN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIA; Phoebe</hi> and <hi>Cynthia</hi> being both Names of

               <hi>Diana. This is all I remember to have met with of that Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this very Year that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there was a Book publiſhed by a learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman; in which others of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Poems, and perhaps that beforementioned, are quoted with great Commendation <note n="*" place="bottom">This Treatiſe, now very ſcarce, is called <hi>The Art of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Poeſy; contrived in three Books:</hi> The firſt of Poets and Poeſy; the ſecond of Proportion; the third of Ornament. <hi>London,</hi> 4to. 1589. I never ſaw but one of them, and this is in the curious Library of that worthy Owner <hi>James Weſt,</hi> Eſq; of the <hi>Middle-Temple.</hi> There is a wooden Print of the Queen before it; and, though dedicated to the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> the Work is addreſs'd directly to the Queen.

            </p>
            <p>Then proceeding to give his Judgment in ſhort Characters of them; and having diſtinguiſh'd the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> for <hi>Comedy, Buckhurſt</hi> for <hi>Tragedy,</hi>

That Critic therefore, where he is ſpeaking of ſome elegant Tautologies in Poetry, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Excellencies of the <hi>Anaphora,</hi> or Figure of <hi>Report,</hi> as he tranſlates it, gives us the following Example, written by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> whether in his <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I cannot yet tell; but, <hi>to his greateſt Miſtreſs, in moſt excellent Verſes,</hi> ſays that Author.</p>

And in another Place, to diſtinguiſh that Form of Repetition, called <hi>Ploche,</hi> or the <hi>Doubler,</hi> a ſpeedy Iteration of one Word, but with ſome little Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he exemplies the two <hi>cloſing Verſes of a moſt excellent Ditty,</hi> as he calls it, written by Sir

            <p>In ſhort he has ſaid ſuch handſome Things of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that it were a Pity any Words even in its Commendation, but his own, ſhould break it. But it will perhaps hereafter be thought he could break it himſelf with as much Succeſs, as now he ſeems to have commanded the keeping it. All that I have ſeen more of his Juvenile Compoſitions in this Kind, is a Paſtoral Sonnet, which old Mr. <hi>Iſaac Walton</hi> reciting, tells us was written by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> in his younger Years, <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Iſaac Walton</hi>'s <hi>Compleat Angler,</hi> 4th Edition, 8vo. 1668. p. 76, &amp;c.

            <p>There is another Poet beſides <hi>Spenſer,</hi> who writ ſomething of <hi>Ralegh</hi> relating to theſe Times, tho' near twenty Years after them; and as on a different Subject, ſo with a different Diſpoſition towards him. This Poet was Sir <hi>John Harrington,</hi> the Tranſlator of <hi>Orlando Furioſo;</hi> but that which he is here mention'd for, is a little Book in Proſe, yet not clear of Poetry, tho' it was intended for a Piece of Church-Hiſtory, and as a Supply to Dr. <hi>Francis Godwin</hi>'s <hi>Catalogue of Biſhops.</hi> This, at the Time that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was under Royal Diſpleaſure in the next Reign, and in Confinement; but growing into Favour with the hopeful Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Sir <hi>John Harrington,</hi> then a Courtier, preſented to that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0181500200:116"/>
Prince; 'tis full of little Jeſts and Tales againſt the married Clergy, and againſt ſome of the Laity who had any Controverſies with them, the better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate with that young Prince, and engage his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; otherwiſe the Author would doubtleſs have written it with a Gravity ſuitable to the Subject; but he tells the Prince, <hi>he took ſome kind of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the Pains of writing it, ſuppoſing (ſays he) I was all the while telling a Story as it were in your Highneſs Preſence and hearing.</hi> Among the Stories he tells, there is one concerning Dr. <hi>Thomas God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> it ſeems; the Relation of which, becauſe that Biſhop died about the latter End of 1590, we ſhall not longer defer. This Biſhop, he tells us, came to that See, among his other good Qualities, unreprovable for Simony, and in the Queen's good Opinion: If he had held on as clear as he enter'd, I ſhould have highly extoll'd him, ſays our Author; but, continues he, ſee his Misfortune, which firſt loſt him the Queen's Favour, and after forced him to another Miſchief. For being aged, diſeaſed, and lame of the Gout, he married, as ſome thought, for Opinion of Wealth, a <hi>London</hi> Widow, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife at leaſt: When a chief Favourite of that Time (whom he had named before in this Kind, and therefore thought by ſome, as perhaps it might be, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh)</hi> had labour'd to get the Manor of <hi>Banwell</hi> from this Biſhoprick; but diſdaining the Repulſe, and hearing of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempeſtive Marriage, he took Advantage thereof, caus'd it to be told the Queen (knowing how much ſhe miſliked ſuch Matches) and inſtantly purſued the Biſhop with Letters and Mandates for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Banwell</hi> for a hundred Years. The good Biſhop, to pacify his Perſecutors, and to ſave <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> was fain to part with <hi>Wilſcomb</hi> for 99 Years;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0181500200:117"/>
and ſo purchaſed his Peace. And, as he did not hold on ſo clear as he enter'd, it might be with Reference to the Simony before-mentioned; the Queen ſaw it not unreaſonable, but eſpouſed the Alienation; ſo that it was her Gift. And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's own Son, Dr. <hi>Francis Godwin,</hi> when he was Biſhop alſo, and reviving his <hi>Catalogue of Biſhops,</hi> in the next Reign. before <hi>Ralegh</hi> was out of Priſon, makes no Complaint againſt him in the Account of his Father's Life; tho' he might ſafely, if he could juſtly, have done it, and <hi>Ralegh</hi> had been poſſeſs'd of that for which this Author's Father had not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of thoſe Times, received Satisfaction. On the contrary, with much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, rather laments that his Father ſhould take upon him the Duties of Eccleſiaſtical Government, when his Infirmities had render'd him unable to diſcharge them.</p>
            <p>If this Affair did any ways diſpleaſe the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, there was another Occurrence fell out about this Time, in which <hi>Ralegh,</hi> by ſhewing a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and charitable Inſtance of his Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, might give ſome further Umbrage for its Diſpleaſure. It was in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>John Udall,</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel, a good Scholar, and a Man of good Parts; but very zealous for the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even under the epiſcopal Government; for which he was reckoned among the Nonconformiſts, or rather Puritans of thoſe Times. He had been bred at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> was ſeven Years Miniſter of <hi>Kingſton upon Thames;</hi> and, through the Favour of the Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> about a Twelvemonth at <hi>Newcaſtle upon Tine.</hi> Here he was ſilenced, ſent for to <hi>London</hi> by Letters from the Lord-chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> in the Name of the Council, and examined about a Book he had newly publiſhed

                  <p>The horrible Treaſon in this Book it ſeems (which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Indictment) lay in theſe Words to the Biſhops: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Who can without bluſhing, deny you to be the Cauſe of all Ungodlineſs, ſeeing your Government is that which giveth Leave to a Man to be any Thing ſaving a ſound Chriſtian: For certainly it is more free in theſe Days to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> an <hi>Anahaptiſt,</hi> of the <hi>Family of Love;</hi> yea, any wicked one what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, than that which we ſhould be: And I could live theſe twenty Years any ſuch in <hi>England,</hi> yea, in a Biſhop's Houſe may-be, and never be moleſted for it.

without legal Proof, and to leave the Felony to them.</p>
            <p>The Jury did as they were taught, being told it ſhould be no further Danger to the Author, but tend to his good; of which Verdict they afterwards repented. Then he was kept half a Year uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Durance; and at the Aſſizes in <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> following at <hi>Southwark,</hi> not relinquiſhing his Tenets, he had the Sentence of Death pronounced againſt him by <hi>Puckering.</hi> But it ſeems before <hi>Udall</hi> received this Sentence, he had procured a Friend to ſollicit Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and aggravated Conſtructions which had been made of his Doctrine and Principles, might not be his utter Deſtruction, 'till a more unprejudiced Judgment was made of them; and immediately after the Sentence was pronounced, the Sheriff brought him a Reprieve from the Queen. Then Dr. <hi>Bond,</hi> one of her Chaplains, came to him in Priſon with a Form of Submiſſion for him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. After two Days Conference, they agreed upon another. But, ſays <hi>Udall, at the ſame Time that Dr.</hi> Bond <hi>was with me, I received a Letter from a Friend of mine that did ſollicit Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>for me.</hi> This Letter he then exhibits, and thereby it appears <hi>Ralegh</hi> had adviſed or encouraged <hi>Udall</hi> to explain himſelf to him concerning thoſe Imputations which had been infuſed into her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which accuſed him with maintaining, the Church of <hi>England</hi> and its Sacraments were no Church and no Sacraments; that its Laws and her Government were againſt the Word of God; that all eccleſiaſtical Matters ought to be governed by a Preſbytery; and that ſhe ought to be ſubject to the Cenſures thereof; for (ſays that Correſpondent) <hi>If ye will write half a Dozen Lines to Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>concerning theſe Opinions, that he may ſhew it</hi>

I know it is very eaſy for you to anſwer all thoſe Things, therefore do it with ſpeed; and in your writing to Sir</hi> Walter <hi>take Knowledge, that he hath ſent you ſuch Word.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Udall</hi> wrote a Letter, which he alſo ſets forth, directed to the <hi>Right honourable Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>Knt.

            <p>After this he remained, according to his own Expreſſion, without great Hope of Liberty, yet without Fear of further Extremity. Whence it may be rightly obſerved by ſome Hiſtorians, that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> through his generous Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, did procure <hi>Udall</hi>'s Reprieve, or ſave him from Execution. 'Till a few Months after, being further peſtered with ſtricter Forms of Submiſſion, by Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he was forced to make further Applications, not only by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> but Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> again, and Dean <hi>Nowell,</hi> againſt the Menaces of the approaching Aſſizes at <hi>Kingſton.</hi> About the ſame Time the King of <hi>Scots</hi> alſo wrote a Letter to the Queen in Behalf of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Udall,</hi> and other learned Nonconformiſts <note n="*" place="bottom">Herein his Majeſty tells the Queen, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That hearing of the Apprehenſion of Mr. <hi>Udall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and certain other learned Miniſters of the Evangell, within your Realm (ſays he) of whoſe good Erudition and fruitful Travels in the Church, we hear a very credible Commendation, howſoever their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity from Biſhops, and others of your Clergy, in Matters touching them in Conſcience, hath been a mean, by their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to work them your Miſliking; at this preſent, we cannot (weighing the Duty we owe to ſuch as are afflicted for their Conſcience in that Profeſſion) but by our moſt effectual and earneſt Letter, interpone us at your Hands to any harder Uſage of them for that Cauſe.

Intereſt, for an old Officer in the Army, ſince there is no Date to it, that confines us to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Year. This Officer had a Sum of Money long owing him, it ſeems, from the Treaſury, and, knowing how well <hi>Ralegh</hi> was acquainted with the Juſtice of the Debt, no leſs than what Influence his Applications would be of for procuring it, prevailed on him to write to the Lord Treaſurer's Secretary, who was afterwards knighted, and well known by the Name of Sir <hi>Michael Hicks,</hi> that he might obtain his Lordſhip's Order for the Payment of the Money. Theſe are the Words of his Letter: <hi>I am moſt earneſtly to intreat you for this Gentleman, Captain</hi> Spring; <hi>that partly for Love, partly for honeſt Conſideration, you will further him with my Lord Treaſurer for a Debt of Three hundred Pounds, which her Majeſty owes him. It hath been long due; and he has got good Warrant for it; beſides, he has ſerved her Majeſty very long, and hath received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wounds in her Service.

many other Inſtances, was ſo far from miſuſing, that, above the narrow Apprehenſions of Repulſe, or laying himſelf under Obligations, he appears to have exerted it in the moſt ſtrenuous and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Manner, either for preventing or relieving the Diſtreſs of others, which moved the greater Compaſſion when his own Misfortunes brought him to Need, and yet to fail of the like liberal and ſucceſsful Mediation for himſelf. The Truth is, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was ſo famous in theſe Days, for ſuch like good Offices, that the Queen ſeems to have diſtinguiſhed him by a Title more honourable, in the proper Senſe it is to be here taken, than any other ſhe conferred upon him: for one Day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told her he had a Favour to beg of her, <hi>When, Sir</hi> Walter, <hi>ſaid ſhe, will you ceaſe to be a</hi> Beggar? To which he anſwered, <hi>When your gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ceaſes to be a</hi> Benefactor. With great Juſtice therefore ſeems, a certain noted Author of theſe Times, to have adapted his Work to a Patron, when he dedicated a Diſcourſe upon <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which he publiſhed not long before this Time, to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi>

This brave Commander was Vice Admiral in the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi>'s Expedition, to intercept the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate Fleet at the Iſles of <hi>Azores</hi> in its Return from <hi>America.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi>

Squadron conſiſted of ſix of the Queen's Ships, ſix Victuallers of <hi>London,</hi> with two or three Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces. They ſet out early 1591, and waited ſix Months at <hi>Flores,</hi> one of thoſe Iſlands, in Expectation of the ſaid Fleet. As there was, beſides the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships before numbered, one alſo of Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s in this Expedition, named <hi>Bark Ralegh,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Thynne;</hi> and as he employed ſome Time in the latter End of this Year to deſcribe that memorable Engagement they had with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the brief Abſtract I ſhall give thereof from his own Words, cannot be arraigned of Prolixity, nor perhaps of Digreſſion; ſince, beſides his Gratitude for the paſt Services of his heroick Kinſman, it ſo well diſplays his Sentiments at this Time of the religious Hypocriſies and Cruelties of their common Enemy. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having had Intelligence of their waiting thus for his <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, ſent an Armada to the <hi>Azores</hi> of fifty-three Sail to convoy it home, under the Command of <hi>Don Alphonſo Baçan.</hi> This Fleet was juſt in ſight of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by then they had any warning of it; and they were ſo unprepared for its Reception, that many of their Crew were on Shore, providing Ballaſt, Water, and other Neceſſaries; and thoſe who were on board, were half of them, through Sickneſs, unfit for Service. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were now ſo near at hand, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſcarce Time to weigh Anchor; and <hi>Greenville,</hi> in the <hi>Revenge,</hi> was the laſt upon the Place, being deſirous of receiving all his Crew aboard from the Iſland, whereof he had no leſs than ninety who were ſick and diſeaſed. So that, unable to recover the Wind, and having but one hundred ſound Men, he was perſuaded to cut his main Sail, caſt about, and truſt to the ſailing of the Ship; for the Squadron of <hi>Seville</hi> was on his Weather-bow:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0181500200:125"/>
But he, through the Greatneſs of his Spirit, utterly refuſed to turn from the Enemy; proteſting, he would rather die than be guilty of ſuch Diſhonour to himſelf, his Country, and her Majeſty's Ship; aſſuring his Company he would paſs through the two Squadrons in ſpite of them, and force thoſe of <hi>Seville</hi> to give him Way; which he performed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers of the foremoſt, who, as the Mariners term it, ſprung their Loof, and fell under the Lee of the <hi>Revenge:</hi> But while he had regard to thoſe who were neareſt, the huge <hi>San Philip,</hi> being in the Wind of him, and approaching, becalmed his Sails in ſuch a manner, that the Ship could neither make way, nor feel the Helm; ſo large and high charged was the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleon, being of fifteen hundred Ton, carrying three Tire, of eleven pieces in each on a Side, and diſcharging eight foreright from her Chaſe, beſides thoſe of her Stern-ports. After the <hi>Revenge</hi> was thus entangled with this <hi>Philip,</hi> four others loofing up alſo, boarded her, two on the Larboard, and two on the Starboard. The Fight thus beginning at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, on the laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Year afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, continued very terrible all that Evening. But <hi>San Philip</hi> having received the lower Tire of the <hi>Revenge,</hi> charged with croſs-bar Shot, ſhifted with all Expedition, utterly miſliking her firſt greeting. Some ſaid ſhe founder'd hereupon; but this is uncertain. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships were filled with Soldiers; ſome having two hundred, beſides Mariners; ſome five, others eight hundred Men; in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship there were only Mariners, with the Commanders Servants, and ſome Gentlemen Voluntiers. After many Exchanges of great and ſmall Shot, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> many times attempted to board the <hi>Revenge,</hi> but were as often beaten back into their own Ships, or into the Sea; and when a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0181500200:126"/>
               <hi>London</hi> Victualler, who was under the Lee of the <hi>Revenge,</hi> offered to undertake any Service for her Aſſiſtance, <hi>Greenville</hi> bid him <hi>"Save himſelf, and leave him to his Fortune.</hi> The Fight thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing while the Day laſted, and ſome Hours of the Night, many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſlain; ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships ſunk; and in many others there was great Slaughter: <hi>Greenville,</hi> though wounded in the beginning of the cloſe Fight, was never ſo diſabled as to forſake the upper Deck for eight Hours together; and then being ſhot into the Body with a Muſket, as the Wound was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he was again ſhot into the Head, and his Surgeon at the ſame time wounded to Death. Still the Fight continued, and as faſt as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were beaten off by the <hi>Revenge,</hi> others came in their Places; ſo that by Morning ſhe had ſuſtained, for fifteen Hours together, the Vollies, Boardings, and Entries of fifteen ſeveral Ships of War, and repulſed them all; beſides the reſt which battered her looſe and at a diſtance. But with the Light, increaſed the Diſcovery of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Condition; and the more irkſome was the one, in that it would not let her conceal the other from her ſurrounding Enemies <note n="*" place="bottom">As for her Friends, the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and the other Ships, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> further ſays of them, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'If all the reſt had entered, all had been loſt; for the very hugeneſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, if no other Violence had been offered, would have cruſh'd them into Shivers; of which the Diſhonour and Loſs to the Queen, had been far greater than the Spoil or Harm that the Enemy could any way have received. Notwithſtanding it is true, that the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> would have entered between the Squadrons, but the reſt would not condeſcend; and the Maſter of his own Ship offered to leap into the Sea, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct it with the reſt to be a Prey to the Enemy; where there was neither Hope or Poſſibility either of Defence or Victory. Which alſo in my Opinion, ſays <hi>Ralegh,</hi> had ill ſorted with, or anſwered the Diſcretion of a General, to commit himſelf and his Charge to aſſured Deſtruction, without hope or any likelihood of prevailing thereby, to diminiſh the Strength of her Majeſty's Navy, and enrich the Pride and Glory of the Enemy. The <hi>Foreſight</hi> of the Queen's (continues he) commanded by Mr. <hi>Vaſavour,</hi> performed a very great Fight, and ſtayed two Hours as near the <hi>Revenge</hi> as the Weather would permit, not forſaking the Fight till he was likely to be encompaſſed by the Squadrons, and with great Difficulty cleared himſelf.

Company to truſt in God's Mercy, and to none elſe; and, as they had thus long and reſolutely repulſed ſo many Enemies, that they would not now leſſen the Honour of their Country, by any Overtures to lengthen for a few Hours or Days their own Lives. Several joined in Opinion with him; but the Majority prevailed, who urged, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> would be as ready to entertain a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as they to offer it; and that there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers valiant Men yet living, who might do their Prince acceptable Service, and revenge this Action upon the Enemy; that the Ship could be of no Uſe either to the one or the other, for upon the firſt working of the Sea ſhe muſt needs ſink, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo cruſhed, rived, and leaky, having ſix Foot Water in the Hold, that ſhe could never remove out of the Place.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General Don <hi>Alphonſo Baçan</hi> yielded that all their Lives ſhould be ſaved, the Company ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and the better Sort only to pay a reaſonable Ranſom, free from all Gallies or Impriſonment.

So he continued his Courſe upon the Seas, 'till he met with a ſhip belonging to Monſ. <hi>Gourdon,</hi> Governor of <hi>Calais,</hi> in which was one Mr. <hi>Nevel Davies,</hi> who was returned from a twelve Years Captivity in <hi>Spain;</hi> and who aſſured him, there was little Hopes of any Succeſs this Year in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ſent expreſs Orders to all the Ports, both of the <hi>Iſlands</hi> and <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> that no Ships ſhould ſtir that Year,

nor any Treaſure be laid aboard for <hi>Spain.</hi> But neither this diſagreeable News, nor the other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, could deter him from proceeding; 'till on the 11th of <hi>May,</hi> when he was off <hi>Cape Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> a moſt raging Tempeſt ariſing, ſo ſcattered the greater Part of the Fleet, and ſunk his Boats and Pinnaces, that, as the Reſt were driven and divided, <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, in the <hi>Garland,</hi> was in great Danger of being ſwallowed up in the Sea. Hereupon, conſidering the Seaſon was too far gone for his Enterpriſe upon <hi>Panama,</hi> and his Victuals too much conſumed; that the ſame Conſumption might further diſable him from lying upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Coaſt, or at the <hi>Iſlands,</hi> to meet with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Fleet, for which he had received ſuch little Encouragement to wait, <hi>Ralegh</hi> made a Diviſion of his Fleet into two Squadrons, committing one under the Charge of Sir <hi>John Burgh,</hi> and the other to Sir <hi>Martin Forbiſher;</hi> and gave his Inſtructions for Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> in the <hi>Garland,</hi> with Capt. <hi>Gifford,</hi> Capt. <hi>Thinne,</hi> Capt. <hi>Greenvill,</hi> and others, to lie off the ſouth Cape to terrify and keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on their own Coaſt; while Sir <hi>John Burgh,</hi> with Capt. <hi>Croſs, Thomſon,</hi> and others, ſhould lie at the <hi>Azores</hi> for the Carracks from <hi>India.</hi> The Succeſs of theſe Directions was anſwerable to the excellent Judgment that contrived them. For the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral, receiving Intelligence that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was cruiſing upon their Coaſt, gathered all his naval Power to watch <hi>Forbiſher,</hi> and defend the ſouthern Parts of <hi>Spain;</hi> while the Carracks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, were left a Prey to Sir <hi>John Burgh.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fleet ſeparated, they met on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt with a great <hi>Biſcayan,</hi> called <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> a Snip of 600 Ton; which, after a Fight for ſome Time, they maſtered, and found freighted with all Sorts of little Iron-work, valued by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at

6 or 7 thouſand Pounds; but of treble the value to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This, having cleared, they ſent to <hi>England.</hi> Then Sir <hi>John Burgh,</hi> in a Ship of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s, named the <hi>Roebuck,</hi> coaſting along towards the South Cape of St. <hi>Vincent;</hi> and, by the way ſpying a Sail, gave her chaſe; which being a Flyboat and good Sailor, drew him far ſouthward, before he could fetch her; at laſt ſhe came under his Lee, and ſtruck ſail. The Maſter confeſs'd a great Fleet was prepared at St. <hi>Lucar</hi> and <hi>Cadiz;</hi> for the Rumour of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s putting out ſtrong for the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> had ſo alarmed the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he raiſed this Fleet to oppoſe and encounter him; though looking for the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of his <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Carracks, he firſt ordered thoſe Ships to convoy them from the <hi>Azores;</hi> but perſuading himſelf if <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Fleet did make for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that then the Iſlands would be infeſted only by ſome ſmall Men of War, which the Carracks of themſelves would be able to cope with, his Order was to <hi>Don Alphonſo de Baçan</hi> to purſue <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Fleet, and engage him, what Courſe ſoever he held: and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſoon found this Information true. For Sir <hi>John Burgh,</hi> as he returned to his Company, deſcried the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet to ſea-ward of him; which having likewiſe diſcovered him, made full Account to bring him into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Harbour; but he dexterouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped them, and ſhaped his Courſe to the <hi>Azores,</hi> according to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Directions. Here he took ſeveral ſmall Caravels; but learnt little Intelligence from them. Arriving at <hi>Flores</hi> on the 21ſt of <hi>June,</hi> and making to the Shore of <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> he found them all in Arms; but, ſhewing a White Flag, he was accommodated by the Inhabitants with whatever he wanted. Here he learnt News of the <hi>Eaſt Indian</hi> Carracks, one whereof had

At laſt <hi>Croſs</hi> fell athwart her all alone, prevented her running aſhore to fire herſelf, as the other had done, and gave the Reſt Time to come up to his Succour; which, after he had fought with her three Hours, he received by the Lord <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s Ships: And then having made a great Slaughter of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they boarded and poſſeſſed themſelves of her with little Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>

very good Lord, we have conferred together about the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Ship to be brought to <hi>Plymouth</hi> by Sir <hi>John Burgh;</hi> and, in our Opinions, ſhe can be no leſs worth than <hi>500,000</hi> l. being a Ship of ſo great Burden, and laden with ſo rich Commodities as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth ſhe is: Wherefore we have conſidered, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Men of War, lying upon the Coaſt of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> hearing of ſo great a Prize taken from the King, or the Merchants of the Country; and, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch a Benefit ſhould grow to us, to their Hindrance and Diſhonour, will endeavour by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means, being diſtant but a Day or Night's Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either to recover the Ship again, or to burn her and all her Lading, rather than ſhe ſhall be deliver'd here; ſeeing that the Places of Defence where the Ship may remain, are not able to reſiſt their Power: In our Opinion therefore we think fit, and do pray your Lordſhip, that the three Ships of her Majeſty's which are appointed to keep the narrow Seas, may, by your Lordſhip's Letter and Directions, be appointed to go Weſtward, and there to guard the <hi>Indian</hi> Ship for a Time, until the <hi>Garland</hi> and ſome of the ſame Fleet be return'd, whoſe Arrival cannot be any long Time expected; or till ſome Order may be taken for the unlading or keeping of her otherwiſe; which we pray your Lordſhip may be done with ſome Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            </p>
            <p>The latter end of this Year, and Beginning of next, we meet with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Houſe, whether return'd for a County or a Borough, and for which, does not at preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly occur. A late Author of his Life ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>that his Speeches were full of Reaſon and Eloquence, no Man in his Days being more a Maſter of Language than himſelf;</hi> and Matter too, he might have added; none more ſatisfactorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his Arguments with Facts and Experience than he did, even in his unpremeditated Speeches, no leſs than in the more deliberate Compoſitions of his Pen; ſo full of Obſervation he was upon all Times and Countries, and ſo readily he could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it upon all Occaſions; which now won him great Regard, as a Speaker in the Houſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as an Author, to the whole World. Soon after the opening of the Seſſion, we find him upon the Committee for the Liberties and Privileges of the Members, to examine and make Report of all Caſes touching the Elections and Returns during the ſaid Seſſion of Parliament: Alſo in another againſt Popiſh Recuſants. And when <hi>the Bill for certain Subſidies</hi> to be granted her Majeſty was in Debate, and ſome Members were for having it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly diſtinguiſh'd in the Bill, that the ſaid Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be for maintaining a War impulſive and defenſive againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that the Conqueſts we made over them might be legal and waarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> ſeconded thoſe Speeches, and ſaid, <hi>He knew many, who held it not lawful in Conſcience, as the Time was, to take Prizes from the</hi> Spaniard; <hi>and he knew, that if it might be lawful and open War, there would be more voluntary Hands</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0181500200:137"/>
               <hi>to fight againſt the</hi> Spaniard <hi>than the Queen ſhould ſtand in need of to ſend to Sea.</hi> Accordingly he was appointed of the Committee for drawing the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Preamble of the ſaid Bill. Further, when the Neceſſity of the ſaid Subſidy came to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſpake for it, <hi>not only</hi> (as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted) <hi>to pleaſe the Queen, to whom he was infinitely bound above his Deſerts; but for the Neeeſſity be both ſaw and knew.</hi> He very well diſcover'd the great Strength of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and, to ſhew his Mightineſs, he told how he poſſeſs'd all the World; as alſo that his Malice and ill Purpoſe was evident to this Realm, he ſhewed how on every Side he had beleaguer'd us. <hi>That in</hi> Denmark, <hi>the King being young, had corrupted the Council and Nobility; ſo as it was very likely he would ſpeed himſelf of Shipping from thence. In the marine Towns of the</hi> Low-Countries, <hi>and in</hi> Norway, <hi>he laid in great Store of Shipping. In</hi> France, <hi>he had the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Towns at his Command; in</hi> Britany, <hi>he had all the beſt Havens; and in</hi> Scotland, <hi>had ſo corrupted the Nobility, that he had promis'd them Forces to aſſiſt the Papiſts; that they were ready to join with any foreign Forces that would make them ſtrong, to be by themſelves and reſiſt others; for, as he thought, there were not ſix Gentlemen of that Country of one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. In his own Counry, there is all poſſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; and he is coming with ſixty Gallies, beſides other Shipping, with Purpoſe to annoy us. We muſt then have no Ships, if he invade us riding at Anchor; all will be little enough to withſtand him. At his coming, he fully reſolveth to get</hi> Plymouth, <hi>or at leaſt to poſſeſs ſome of the Havens this Summer within our Land; and</hi> Plymouth <hi>is a Place of moſt Danger, for no Ordnance can be carried thither to remove him, the Paſſages will not give leave. Now the Way to defeat him, is to ſend a Royal Army to ſupplant him</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0181500200:138"/>
               <hi>in</hi> Britany, <hi>and to poſſeſs ourſelves there; and to ſend a ſtrong Navy to Sea, and to lie upon the</hi> Cape, <hi>and at</hi> Lambuck; <hi>to which Places come all his Ships with Riches from all Parts, and then they may ſet upon all that come. This we are able to do, and undoubtedly with fortunate Succeſs, if we undertake it.</hi> But ſome Diviſion ariſing upon the Queſtion how they ſhould make the Motion for this Supply to the Lords, <hi>Ralegh</hi> made ſo judicious a Diſtinction of the Cauſe thereof, and ſo clearly demonſtrated the erroneous Manner in which it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that it appears plainly, the ſucceſsful Turn which follow'd thereupon was owing to him alone. After this Conference, ſeveral Forms of Proviſion were propos'd by way of treble Subſidies, and like proportionable Fifteenths and Tenths, with other Kinds of Benevolence: Sir <hi>Thomas Cecil</hi> was for three Subſidies to be paid in four Years, and to be charged upon Men of ten Pounds and upwards, to ſpare thoſe who were under. Sir <hi>Henry Knivet</hi> alledged the Poverty of our Country againſt the Reaſons uſed, and imputed that Poverty to the bringing in more foreign Wares, than we vented Commodities, whereby our Money was carried out of our Country, which was thus become like a Pond that was fed with a Spring, but having a Breach, through which more paſſed away than came in: Thereupon moved for a Survey to be taken of all Men's Lands and Goods in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo much to be yearly levied as might maintain the Queens Wars, the Proportion being ſet 100,000 Pounds yearly; or, if that was miſliked, every Man on his Word ſhould deliver in, to his Power, the Profits of his Lands and Goods; ſo a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be ceſs'd accordingly. To him who argued of the Poverty of the Land, from the Multitude of Beggars, <hi>Ralegh</hi> gave theſe Reaſons: <hi>That the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0181500200:139"/>
               <hi>Companies in</hi> Normandy <hi>and the</hi> Low-Countries, <hi>who returned maimed higher, never went back again to the Towns from whence they came: For a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Clothiers, taking their Looms into their Hands, ſpun their Wool themſelves; and except we would work for them cheaper than they can make themſelves, they will ſet none to work. This engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſo many Trades into their own Hands, beggars ſo many as uſually lived by the Trade.</hi> As for the ſurveying of ſo many Men's Eſtates, he thought it inconvenient. <hi>For many, being eſteemed richer than they are, would be found Beggars, and increaſe the Opinion of their Number, by loſing their Credit, which is now their Wealth. He further reported of his own Knowledge, that the</hi> Weſt-Country, <hi>ſince the Parliament begun, had taken from them the Worth of</hi> 440,000 <hi>Pounds; and that thoſe of</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>lay ſtill for fear, becauſe the</hi> Bourdeaux <hi>Fleet was taken this Year by the Enemy. For the Enemy approaching us, and being become our Neighbour, our Trades will decay every Day, and ſo our Poverty increaſes. Thus it is moſt certain; the longer we defer Aid, the leſs able we ſhall be to yield it; yet in the End, the greater Aid will be required; ſo ſparing them now, we ſhall charge them when they ſhall be leſs able to bear it: For it is moſt true,</hi> 100000 <hi>Pounds would have done the laſt Year, that which three will not now do; and three will do this Year, that which ſix will not do hereafter.</hi> In the Concluſion, he agreed to three Subſidies; in them, the Three-pound Men to be ſpared; the Sum which came from them, to be lev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> upon thoſe of ten Pound and upwards; and the Payment to be ſpeedy. Mr. <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to three Subſidies; but not to the Payments under ſix Years: But to his Reaſons of Difficulty and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in a ſpeedier Levy, which might hazard a double Peril, by making it four Shillings in the Pound, a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0181500200:140"/>
double Payment; <hi>Ralegh</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I ſee no Reaſon that the Suſpicion of Diſcontentment ſhould croſs the Proviſion for the preſent Danger. The Time is now more dangerous than it was in Eighty-eight; for then the</hi> Spaniard <hi>coming from</hi> Spain, <hi>was to paſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seas, and had no Place of Retreat or Relief if he fail'd: But now he has in</hi> Britany <hi>great Store of Shipping; a Landing place in</hi> Scotland; <hi>and Men and Horſes there as good as any we have. But for the Difficulty in getting this Subſidy, I think it ſeems more difficult by</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>than it would be in</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering. In the End, it was carried agreeable to his Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Soon after there was a <hi>Bill</hi> read in the Houſe <hi>againſt counterfeiting the Hands of Counſellors or principal Officers;</hi> and upon the ſecond reading, it was committed to Sir <hi>John Woolley</hi> and Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh,</hi> with others. But after a Meeting in the <hi>Middle Temple</hi> Hall, Sir <hi>John</hi> made Report to the Houſe, that himſelf, and the Reſidue of the Committee, upon the End of their Examination, did think it a very dangerous Bill; and not fit to paſs the Houſe. But the <hi>Bill againſt Aliens ſelling foreign Wares among us by Retail,</hi> produced ſeveral weighty Arguments and Speeches in the Houſe, which have been tranſmitted to us. Theſe Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> who had neſtled themſelves in <hi>St. Martins,</hi> antiently allow'd for a Sanctuary, and therefore ſtill had this Privilege: Here they practis'd Spinning and Weaving, to the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and Complaint of Merchants and regular Dealers in our own City; inſomuch that threeſcore <hi>Engliſh</hi> Retailers had been ruin'd by them ſince the laſt Parliament, to the Diminution, beſides their own private Subſtance, of the Queen's Subſidy and the publick Treaſure; 20000<hi>l.</hi> a Year at leaſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been carried out of the Realm by them. They
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0181500200:141"/>
               <hi>had indeed ſome learned Council who pleaded for them at the Bar, and ſome of the Members ſpoke in their Behalf. Other Arguments were uſed; but againſt theſe,</hi> Ralegh <hi>concur'd with thoſe who thought that Denization ought not to circumvent Birth right; and that to behave ourſelves like Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to Foreigners, was but making ourſelves Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to our Neighbours.</hi> Whereas it is pretended <hi>(ſays he)</hi> that for Strangers, it is againſt Charity, againſt Honour, againſt Profit, to expel them; in my Opinion, it is no Matter of <hi>Charity</hi> to relieve them. For firſt, ſuch as fly hither have forſaken their own King; and Religion is no Pretext for them, for we have no <hi>Dutchmen</hi> here, but ſuch as come from thoſe Princes where the Goſpel is preach'd; yet here they live, diſliking our Church. For <hi>Honour:</hi> It is Honour to uſe Strangers as we be uſed among Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and it is a Lightneſs in a Commonwealth, yea, a Baſeneſs in a Nation, to give a Liberty to another Nation which we cannot receive again. In <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where our Intercourſe was moſt, we were never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to have a Taylor or a Shoe-maker to dwell. Nay, at <hi>Milan,</hi> where there are Three hundred Pound <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> they cannot ſo much as have a Barber among them. And for <hi>Profit;</hi> they are all of the Houſe of <hi>Almoigne,</hi> who pay nothing; yea, eat out our Profits, and ſupplant our own Nation. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom indeed they pay; paying Fifteen-Pence where we pay Twelve-Pence; but they are diſcharged of Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The Nature of the <hi>Dutchman</hi> is to fly to no Man but for his Profit; and they will obey no Man long; now under <hi>Spain;</hi> now under <hi>Mountfort;</hi> now under the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but under no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor long.

            <p>This Speech we may meet with in ſome modern Writings, quoted in Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Praiſe, both for his Knowledge in the Intereſt of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and his unbiaſs'd Affection in exerting it. As for the Bill, he was one to whom it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and who, after the Travels of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee upon it, offered it again to the Houſe with the addition of a Proviſo. On the 27th of <hi>March</hi> following, that is to ſay, in the Year 1593, it was read the third time; and, after many long Speeches, which are not ſpecify'd, paſſed upon the Queſtion, by the Diviſion of the Houſe, with the difference of fourſcore Voices; the <hi>Yeas</hi> being 162, the <hi>Noes</hi> 82. About a Week afterwards there was a Bill, for explaining a Branch in <hi>an Act to retain the Queen's Subjects in due Obedience,</hi> read; and many Speeches paſs'd in the Houſe before it was committed, through the many Imperfections in the Preamble and Body of the ſaid Bill. For it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Puniſhment only of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and other Sectaries; but, alledging nothing againſt them in particular, contained ſome enſnaring Clauſes that might comprehend more innocent Perſons. As the Speeches before Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s, on this Occaſion, are not rehearſed, we can only gueſs at them, by what is preſerved of his; who ſaid, <hi>In my Conceit, the</hi> Browniſts <hi>are</hi>

            <p>This Year we met with a notable Libel in print, ſet forth by a <hi>Lover of his Country,</hi> as he calls himſelf, to expoſe certain Miniſters and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of State, who had been inſtrumental in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſearching Proclamation againſt the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> which was publiſhed about two Years before. For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having lately founded an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloyſter at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> as a Nurſery to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with Treaſon and Rebellion; ſo many hopeful Stocks of that Species were ſoon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into <hi>England,</hi> as occaſioned the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to extirpate them. Now this Anſwer was publiſhed to calumniate the ſuppoſed Authors of it; and as <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears, among other very good Company, to have his Share of the Slander therein; ſo he might probably have had a Hand in thoſe wholeſome Articles for the Safety of the Realm, which occaſioned it. For after this Libel has reviled the greateſt and wiſeſt Miniſters of the Nation, it ſeems to have reſerved the Quinteſſence for him, who had the Ability ſo many Ways to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0181500200:145"/>
cruſh the pernicious Purpoſes which were daily hatching by the viperous Brood which brought it forth. For <hi>Ralegh</hi> had given ſuch Proofs of his ſound and ſincere Affection to Religion, that his Sentiments were made uſe of to reform or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late even the Profeſſors of it; yet now his Head muſt be turn'd ſo exceſſively to its Detriment, as to provoke this Libeller's pious Spleen againſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>School of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm;</hi> compendiouſly inſinuating, as if truly he was not ſatisfied with being a Diſciple, but ſet up for a Doctor in his Faculty, and won young <hi>Gentlemen into his ſaid School; wherein the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were jeſted at, and Scholars taught to ſpell</hi> God <hi>backwards.</hi> Then he complains, <hi>what a miſerable Thing it is, that her Majeſty ſhould make Laws and Proclamations according to theſe Mens Senſes and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi> But there may need little Pains to blunt the Point of this Dart, when we ſhall further conſider that it came out of a Jeſuitical Quiver; for by whom ſhould it be levelled againſt him but <hi>Robert Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> the notorious Traitor and Incendiary! How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deeply he diſguis'd himſelf into a <hi>Lover of his Country.</hi> Nevertheleſs, ſome ten Years after, when <hi>Ralegh</hi> was trampled down by the Court, and there was a Turn of State to ſerve, this might be a good ſerviceable Obloquy enough to upbraid him with, and depreciate him in the Eye of the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. But theſe prejudiced Repreſentations will probably be thought of ſo little Authority, that the Reaſons and Matter of Fact which have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in a poetical Performance, may be ſufficien to make thoſe Stains even befriend his Reputation and brighten it in clearing them away. <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>As for <hi>Ralegh,</hi> what might not a little ſharpen theſe Detractions againſt him, was perhaps a Grant about this Time made him from the Crown of ſome Church Lands; a Courſe of Reward uſual with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> towards ſuch as had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed any conſiderable Services for the State. The Story, as we are forced to gather it from thoſe Authors, by whom it has not been over-favourably told, is, That about the Year 1594, the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Coldwell,</hi> who had been bred
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0181500200:151"/>
a Phyſician, gave his See a ſtrong Purge, by alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Mannor of <hi>Sherborne</hi> to Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh.</hi> Sir <hi>John Harrington,</hi> ſpeaks of an ominous Preſage, to make his Tale as affecting as he can to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and inſinuate the Diſpleaſure even of Heaven againſt Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> where he obſerves, <hi>That Sir</hi> Walter, <hi>uſing often to ride Poſt in theſe Days, upon no ſmall Employments, between</hi> Plymouth <hi>and the Court, when</hi> Sherborne <hi>Caſtle being right in the Way, he caſt ſuch an Eye upon it, as</hi> Ahab <hi>did upon</hi> Naboth<hi>'s Vineyard; and once above the reſt being talking of it; of the Commodiouſneſs of the Place; of the Strength of the Seat; and how eaſily it might be got from the Biſhoprick; ſuddenly, over and over came his Horſe; that his very Face, which was then thought a very good Face, ploughed up the Earth where he fell. This Fall was ominous, I make no queſtion,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as the like was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Lord</hi> Haſtings, &amp;c. <hi>but his Brother</hi> Adrian <hi>would needs have him interpret that, not as a Courtier, but as a Conqueror, it preſaged the quiet Poſſeſſion thereof. And this, through the Queen's Favour, came to paſs:</hi> For after Dr. <hi>John Piers</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>York,</hi> this Dr. <hi>Coldwell</hi> was elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſucceed him in the See of <hi>Saliſbury;</hi> but it lay vacant three Years: in which dangerous Junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for denial, all the Doctor's Church-Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being diſpoſed of, yet before his Election was confirmed, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> importuned him to paſs <hi>Sherborne</hi> to the Crown, and effected it; ſo ſhot the good old Man (as one of them phraſes it) <hi>between Wind and Water;</hi> though indeed (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed) a good round Rent was reſerved to the Biſhoprick. Then Sir <hi>Walter</hi> begged the ſame of the Queen, and obtained it; much after the ſame Method that Sir <hi>William Killigrew</hi> got the Mannor of <hi>Crediton</hi> from the Church of <hi>Exeter,</hi> by the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0181500200:152"/>
Conſent of Biſhop <hi>Babington. Ralegh</hi> embelliſhed his Sovereign's Bounty with great Magnificence and Commendation; not that he was in danger thereby of falling under the Remark he has made on common Builders of ſumptuous Seats, <hi>That Men are rather known by their</hi> Houſes, <hi>than their</hi> Houſes <hi>by them.</hi> Yet his elegant Taſte in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſufficiently atteſted by an Author who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Improvements he made upon this Eſtate when they were freſh and in their Splendour, and who tells us, <hi>That the Queen having granted the Fee-farm of</hi> Sherborne <hi>to Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>he began to build the Caſtle very fairly; but altering his Purpoſe, he built in the Park adjoining a most fine Houſe, which he beautified with Orchards, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Groves of much Variety and great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; ſo that, whether you conſider the Pleaſantneſs of the Seat, the Goodneſs of the Soil, or other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies belonging to it, it reſts</hi> (ſays he) <hi>unparallele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In this Reign were alſo firſt propagated among us <hi>Hops</hi> and <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chokes;</hi> and then were <hi>Cherry</hi> Orchards firſt planted here, about <hi>Sittingborne</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> with a more improved Kind of that Fruit, brought from <hi>Flanders</hi> by one <hi>Harris,</hi> another of that King's Gardeners: But what effect <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Recommendation of <hi>Olive-Trees</hi> had with King <hi>Edward</hi> VI.

Now it has been a conſtant Tradition at <hi>Bedding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that this Knight of that noble Family was Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> who was allied thereto, if not otherwiſe, by the laſt of that Sirname's adopting his near Kinſman, a <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> to be his Heir, on Condition that he would aſſume the Name and Arms of <hi>Carew;</hi> and how <hi>Ralegh</hi> became related to the <hi>Throgmortons,</hi> will in a little Space appear.

the Seat; and his Words are, <hi>'Tis the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Family, that Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>who was related to it, brought over and planted the old Orange Trees here.</hi> But in the Houſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a fine Cabbin Bed which was his, having Furniture of green Silk, and Legs carved like Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, gilt with Gold. In ſhort, the Seat was now ſo frequented, that not only <hi>Raleigh</hi> and other Courtiers, but the Queen received here many agreeable Entertainments <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Hugh Plat</hi> informs us, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That delicate Knight Sir <hi>Francis Carew,</hi> once making a ſplendid Entertainment for Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at <hi>Beddington,</hi> led her Majeſty, after Dinner, to a Cherry-Tree in his Garden, which had on it Fruit in their Prime, then above a Month after all Cherries had taken their farewell of <hi>England.</hi> This Retardation he performed by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tent or Canvas Cover over the whole Tree, and wetting it as the Weather required with a Scoop; ſo by obſtructing the Sun-Beams, they grew both great, and were very long before they gained their perfect Cherry-colour; and when he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the Time her Majeſty would come, he removed the Tent, and a few ſunny Days brought them to their full Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.'</q> See his <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> 12 mo. 1655. pag. 165.</note>; for ſome of which ſhe could not eſcape the Cenſure of her jeſuited Enemies.</p>
            <p>As to the Seat at <hi>West Horſeley</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> there is good Authority that it was in the Poſſeſſion of his Son, if not his own; and in the Hall of that Houſe, there are in ſeveral Places of the Walls and Cieling the Arms of <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſtill viſible. But there is a Houſe no farther from <hi>London</hi> than <hi>Iſling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> about a Bow's Shot on this Side the Church, which, though I think it has no ſuch Evidences remaining upon its Walls, Cielings, or Windows, that will prove him to have been its Owner, the Arms that are ſeen there, above a hundred Years old, being of a ſucceeding Inhabitant; is yet popularly reported to have been a <hi>villa</hi> of his. For the preſent Tenant affirms, <hi>His Landlord was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed</hi>

               <hi>of ſome old Account Books, by which it appears beyond all doubt this Houſe and fourteen Acres of Land, now let at about ſeventy Pounds</hi> per Annum, <hi>did belong to Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh; <hi>and that the oldeſt Man in the Pariſh would often declare his Father bad told him, Sir</hi> Walter <hi>purpoſed to wall in that Ground, with intention to keep ſome of his Horſes therein; further, that ſome Huſbandmen ploughing up the ſame a few Years ſince, found ſeveral Pieces of Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s Money, whereof they brought, whatever they might reſerve to themſelves, about fourſcore Shillings to their Maſter, the ſaid Tenant,</hi> in whoſe Hands I have ſeen of the ſaid Coin. As for the Houſe, it is, and has been for many Years, an Inn; ſo that what it was, is not clearly to be judged from its preſent outward Appearance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much impaired, or very coarſely repaired, and diminiſhed perhaps from what it might be when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Diſtinction lived in it. However, there are within fide ſome ſpacious Rooms; the Parlour was painted round the uppermoſt Part of the Wainſcot in about a dozen Pannels with Scripture Hiſtories; but now ſo old and decayed, as to be ſcarcely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable. There is alſo a noble Dining-Room, the Cieling whereof is all over wrought in <hi>plaſtick</hi> or fret Work, with Repreſentations of the <hi>Five Senſes;</hi> and the Chimney-piece, with the <hi>Three principal Chriſtian Virtues.</hi> But the Arms in the Window, as well as in that of the Hall, are by the preſent Inhabitants erroneouſly called Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s; there being a Date under one of the Coats, which ſhews it was <hi>aneal'd</hi> ſix Years after his Death. So that we are not ſure the Decorations aforeſaid were done by his Direction, or that others more rich and elegant were not in their ſtead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. As for his Dwellings in <hi>London,</hi> we have read before that he had Apartments in the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0181500200:156"/>
Court at <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, and ſhall read hereafter of ſome Acquaintance reſorting to him at <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe in the <hi>Strand;</hi> that he had a Houſe by the <hi>Thames</hi> Side, which might be the ſame; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, or Apartments alſo in the Court there.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> did not live ſo long at Court, and ſo much about the dazzling Beauties in it, without having the Wings of his Glory, at laſt, ſomewhat ſing'd in the Flames thereof; yet Love, which in ſome great Courtiers of thoſe Times, was the grand Buſineſs of their Life, ſeemed only an Interlude in his. There was among the Queen's Maids of Honour a beautiful young Lady (as her Picture repreſents her) named <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter of Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton,</hi> an able Stateſman and Ambaſſador, whoſe Negociations and Characters are recorded both by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians of thoſe Times. With this Lady, <hi>Ralegh</hi> had, it ſeems, an Amour; and, as he was a Man of nervous Addreſs, won her Heart even to the laſt Favour incluſive. This Intimacy came at laſt to the Queen's Knowledge; whether enviouſly betrayed by any female Confident, as ſome might apprehend, from a Character <hi>Ralegh</hi> would beſtow upon the Ladies of the Privy-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Bed-Chamber; being wont to ſay, <hi>They were like Witches who could do hurt, but could do no good;</hi> or whether the Intrigue could not be long concealed for the Fruits of it, as ſome, who mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſlander <hi>Ralegh</hi> in other Particulars, have not ſcrupled to ſuggeſt, the Reader has it in his Choice to believe. But in ſuch Colours this Matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virginating a Maid of Honour was heightened, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was out of Favour again; alſo in Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſeveral Months; and when enlarged, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the Court; whence the Lady alſo was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0181500200:157"/>
from her Attendance. Yet, as heinous as this Miſdemeanour was in <hi>Ralegh,</hi> her Majeſty did not puniſh it in <hi>Leiceſter, Eſſex,</hi> and other Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, noted in their Days for ſuch Intrigues; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the former, who turned off <hi>Douglas Sheffield,</hi> by whom he had a Son, to marry the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>'s Mother. But <hi>Ralegh</hi> very readily made the moſt honourable Reparation he could, by marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Object of his Affection. It appears they lived together ever after in the moſt exemplary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of conjugal Harmony; and when he was in his greateſt Troubles, there are Teſtimonies from one, who was otherwiſe none of his greateſt Friends, of her extraordinary Diligence and Fidelity in making Intereſt and Applications to aſſuage them. What his Thoughts were of a married Life, in compariſon with a ſingle one, may ſomewhat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in that Obſervation he made upon a certain Nobleman's growing plump after Matrimony, who was meagre before; for another Perſon in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany remarking thereupon, that it fared with him contrary to what it did with other married Men, who uſually at firſt became lean after it; <hi>Ralegh</hi> very pleaſantly obviated the Rarity, by ſaying, <hi>Why, there is no Beaſt, that, if you take him from the</hi> Common, <hi>and put him into the</hi> Several, <hi>but he will grow fat.</hi> Many Years afterwards, when <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> wrote his <hi>Inſtructions to his Son,</hi> he ſufficiently explained this Sentiment in the grave and paternal Manner he is then writing, for his Conduct in the <hi>Choice of a Wife;</hi> which Topick he concludes, with adviſing him <hi>to beſtow his Youth ſo, that he may have comfort to remember it when it has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him.</hi> And, <hi>That his Son would evermore care to be beloved</hi> by <hi>his Wife, than be beſotted</hi> on <hi>her.</hi> That <hi>if he cannot forbear to</hi> Love, <hi>yet forbear to</hi> Link. However, approves of a mature and ſettled
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0181500200:158"/>
Choice at laſt, even while he is upon the Stage of his Virility. <hi>For, believe it, the young Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth the old Huſband; and ſhe that had thee not in thy</hi> Flower, <hi>will deſpiſe thee in thy</hi> Fall. But not to marry for Beauty only; <hi>left thou bind thyſelf for Life, to that which perchance will never laſt or pleaſe one Year.</hi> Nor yet an uncomely Woman; <hi>as much regard being due at leaſt to our own Iſſue as to any other Race of Creatures; and Comelineſs in Children is Riches, if nothing elſe be left them.</hi> He remains pretty ſafe in this Opinion from many Cenſures by the hard-favoured Part of the Sex, becauſe he knew that few Ladies would be poſitive upon this Head in their Right to reprove him; nor will Widows believe he has treated them with Rigour, while they remain in that State, ſince he has ſaid, <hi>Leave not thy Wife to be a Shame unto thee after thou art dead; but that ſhe may live according to thy Eſtate; eſpecially if thou haſt few Children, and thoſe provided for.</hi> Though he does alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, <hi>Leave her no more than of Neceſſity thou muſt, but only during her Widowhood; for if ſhe Love again, let not her enjoy her ſecond Love in the ſame Bed wherein ſhe loved thee; nor fly to future Pleaſures with thoſe Feathers which Death hath pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from thy Wings.</hi> Not that he was averſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages, for he adviſed his own Wife to marry again, when he was in Expectation of being ſuddenly divided from her for ever. Many other weighty Admonitions may be found relating to that Sex among his Writings, ſome of which we meet with, quoted by our moſt accompliſhed Humaniſts and Criticks in the Manners and Paſſions of Life, as from an Author who had read their Hearts thro' all their Veils and Diſguiſes: But one of thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, tho' he allows him all the advantageous Views of Life through ſuch a Variety of Scenes; as <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0181500200:159"/>
               <hi>lived in Courts and Camps; travelled through many Countries; ſeen many Men under ſeveral Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and of as various Complexions;</hi> yet thinks (in which every Body will not agree) <hi>he ſpeaks of our Impotence to reſiſt the Wiles of Women, in very ſevere Terms;</hi> where <hi>Ralegh</hi> has upon the ſolid Ground of the greateſt Examples admoniſhed us, to what fatal Inconveniences Mankind is allured by their reſtleſs Curioſity of knowing what is unfit for their Knowledge, and the prevailing Expedients to gratify it of diſſimulate Sorrow and Unquietneſs.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Ralegh</hi> was under the Diſpleaſure afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and in Retirement, he projected a further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from the Court; the better by that Diſtance, and ſome memorable Exploit, to allay the Malice of his Enemies, and recover his Soveraign's Love. Some thought this an impolitick Courſe; as if his foreign Actions could not work ſo effectually to his Advantage, as the Applications of his Adverſaries to his Diſparagement. And hereupon Sir <hi>Robert Naunton</hi> ſays, <hi>That finding his Favour declining, and falling into a Receſs, he undertook a new Peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to leave that</hi> Terra infirma <hi>of the Court, for that of the Wars, and by declining himſelf, and by abſence to expel his and the Paſſion of his Enemies; which in Court (ſays he) was a ſtrange Device of Recovery; but that he knew there was ſome ill Office done him, that he durſt not attempt to mind any other Ways than by going aſide, thereby to teach Envy a new Way of Forgetfulneſs, and not ſo much as to think of him: Howſoever, he had it always in Mind never to forget himſelf; and his Device took ſo well, that at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he came in, as Rams do by going backwards, with the greater Strength; and ſo continued to the laſt great in her Grace.</hi> Thus alſo ſays another Author, <hi>His Enemies of greater Rank kept him under; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in, ſometimes out; and then he would wiſely</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0181500200:160"/>
               <hi>decline himſelf out of the</hi> Court-road: <hi>And then you found him not but by Fame; in Voyages to the</hi> Weſt-Indies, Guiana, New Plantations, Virginia, <hi>or in ſome Expeditions againſt the</hi> Spaniards. And thus writes a third to the ſame Purpoſe: <hi>'Tis obſervable, that Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>was in and out at Court ſo often, that he was commonly called the</hi> Tennis Ball of Fortune <hi>which ſhe delighted to ſport with. His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies perpetually brought him into Diſgrace with his Miſtreſs, and his Merit in a little Time reſtored him again to her Favour: And as ſhe always grew cold to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>after Abſence; ſo ſhe ever received</hi> Ralegh <hi>with greater Marks of her Eſteem; and he was too hard for his Rivals by the very Means which they intended for his Deſtruction.</hi> Certainly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſuch good Fortune, beyond all others, of a Reſtitution to royal Favour, who coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſo much more hazardouſly and heroically than any of them aſpire to earn it; as now he abundantly manifeſted, in that grand and gallant Undertaking to diſcover and conquer the large, rich, and beautiful Empire of <hi>Guiana;</hi> an Enterprize which had baffled the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Efforts of ſome of the ableſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Captains and Cavaliers in <hi>Spain</hi> for near 100 Years paſt: for, in one of their own Authors; we may read the Names of many brave Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and their Commendations for the Miſeries they endured, who within that Space had trod this Maze, and loſt themſelves, with ſome, 500, ſome 1000 Men apiece, in finding out this Country. And yet none of all their own Authors have more nobly and liberally celebrated theſe, and other ſuch like Adventurers of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, than <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> himſelf has done.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ralegh,</hi> induſtrious in diving into the Cauſes of ſo many Failures, having informed himſelf what ambient Courſes the preceding Adventurers had
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0181500200:161"/>
taken to arrive at the Heart of the Country they ſought, and which was the ſhorteſt Way to make a ſucceſsful Diſcovery, found that moſt of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Attempts in theſe Parts had failed, through the Mutinies and Diſcords which they had fomented among themſelves; as moſt of their Conqueſts in others, were much owing to the like Factions among the <hi>Americans:</hi> And if <hi>there was not an expert Soldier or Seaman but he conſulted (as one Author obſerves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Character in general) nor a printed or manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Diſcourſe but he peruſed; whereby it came to paſs, there were not exacter Rules or Principles for both Services then he drew:</hi> Much more may we believe he now particularly made Uſe of theſe Helps and Lights to draw thoſe Rules and Directions by which this Year (laſt mentioned, 1594) he gave to an old Officer, Capt. <hi>Whiddon,</hi> whoſe Experience he had before tried, for a Voyage to the Country aforeſaid: And this ſame Year that Captain alſo returned from thence, with ſeveral inducing Confirmations of the Grandeur and Opulency of <hi>Guiana,</hi> having learnt the ſame from ſome of the grand Caſiques, or principal Rulers, upon the Borders thereof; but not without Complaints of ſome barbarous Treachery from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governor, who had then got ſome Footing there; and, after promiſes of ſuffering the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to furniſh themſeves with what Supplies they wanted, decoyed ſeveral of them to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Ralegh</hi> had thus more Spurs than one, inciting him to viſit theſe Regions in Perſon.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0181500200:165"/>
to reſcue them from this Yoke of Tyranny: Therefore he boldly ſet upon the <hi>Corps du Garde</hi> in the Duſk of the Evening; and having put them to the Sword, advanced with a hundred Men, and by Break of Day took their new City call'd <hi>San Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> which, at the Entreaty of the <hi>Indians,</hi> he ſet on Fire. Then were the Natives in Confinement, ſet at Liberty. Among them were five <hi>Caſiques,</hi> or petty Kings in thoſe Parts. Theſe, all bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Chain, almoſt dead with Famine, and waſted with Torments; having had their naked Bodies baſted or dropp'd over with burning Bacon; <hi>Ralegh</hi> alſo, to his great Reputation, deliver'd from their Captivity; and ſeveral Years after, when this, with <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s other noble Acts among theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> was mention'd by ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Adventurers to <hi>Guiana,</hi> it was freſhly retain'd and gratefully acknowledg'd by them to his Honour; when alſo one of their braveſt Princes, who had been in <hi>England,</hi> and chriſten'd <hi>Ragapo,</hi> came above a hundred Miles to viſit them, for the great Love he bore to <hi>Ralegh;</hi> manifeſtly ſhewing, how durably he had engag'd their Affection and Deſires for his Return to be their Ruler and Protector. But for the Governor, who had impriſon'd ſo many of them, he was now become a Priſoner himſelf; and <hi>Ralegh,</hi> by his courteous Treatment of him, reaped the Fruit of that Knowledge and Experience he had gather'd in the many Years he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd, with great Sums of Money, upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Guiana.</hi> The ſame Day that <hi>Ralegh</hi> made this Conqueſt, arrived Captain <hi>Gifford</hi> and Captain <hi>Keymis,</hi> and in their Ships divers Gentlemen and others, which to his little Army was a great Succour and Solace. Then proceeding upon his Diſcovery, <hi>Ralegh</hi> firſt call'd all the Chiefs of the Iſland together, who were Enemies to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi>

The like and larger Speeches he made in ſolemn Manner to the reſt of the Nations, both in his Paſſage to <hi>Guiana</hi> and to thoſe of the Borders: So as in that Part of the World the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Fame was diffus'd with great Admiration. This done, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> return'd to <hi>Curiapan,</hi> and tho' he had learn'd of <hi>Berreo,</hi> that <hi>Guiana</hi> was ſome hundred Miles further than the Accounts he receiv'd of Captain <hi>Whiddon</hi> had repreſented it, he kept the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof from his Company, whom he fear'd would have been diſcourag'd thereby from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Diſcovery. When <hi>Ralegh</hi> had further gather'd from <hi>Berreo</hi> the Proceedings of the paſt Adventurers and his own, of all which he gives us a ſuccinct and curious Hiſtory, he told him he was come upon the ſame Deſign, and was reſolved to ſee <hi>Guiana. Berreo</hi> uſed many Arguments to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him; as that he muſt venture in very light and ſmall Boats to paſs ſo many dangerous Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and could not carry Victuals enough above half the Way; that none of the Country would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0181500200:167"/>
ſpeak with him; and, if he followed them, would burn their Towns; beſides, the Way was long, the Winter at hand, and the Rivers beginning to ſwell; but above all, that the Kings and Lords, who bordered upon <hi>Guiana,</hi> had decreed, that none of them ſhould trade with any Chriſtians for Gold, becauſe the ſame would be their own Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> reſolving however to make Trial, directed his Vice-Admiral, Captain <hi>Gifford,</hi> and Captain <hi>Calfield,</hi> to turn Eaſtward againſt the Mouth of the River <hi>Capuri,</hi> and gave them Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to anchor at the Edge of the Shoal, and upon the beſt of the Flood to thruſt over; but they labour'd in vain: Nor did the Flood continue ſo long, but the Water fell before they could have paſſed the Sands. Then <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſent one <hi>King,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Lion's Whelp,</hi> to try another Branch, called the <hi>Amana,</hi> if either of the ſmall Ships would enter; but when he came to the Mouth, he found it as the reſt. After him went <hi>John Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> who diſcover'd four goodly Entrances; but all ſhoal'd and ſhallow in the Bays leading to them. In the mean Time <hi>Ralegh,</hi> fearing the worſt, cauſed his Carpenters to cut down an old Galego Boat, to fit her with Banks for Oars, and ſo as ſhe might draw but five Foot; in this went <hi>Ralegh,</hi> with Gentlemen and Officers to the Number of threeſcore. In the <hi>Lion's Whelp</hi> Boat and Wherry they carried twenty; Captain <hi>Calfield,</hi> in his Wherry, carried ten; and a Barge of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s ten more. This was all the Means they had, having left their Ships at <hi>Curiapan,</hi> to carry a hundred Men, with Weapons and Proviſions for a Month, expoſed to all the Extremes of the Weather, all the Hazards of the Water; to lie open to the Air, and upon hard Boards by Night; in Storms of Rain, or under the burning Sun by Day; to ſwell
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0181500200:168"/>
the wet Cloaths of ſo many crowded together; the Dreſſing of their Food, and that moſtly ſtale Fiſh, in the ſame Place; to be in ſuch a Labyrinth of Rivers, in ſuch a remote and unknown Region; what Priſon could be more loathſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy? what Proſpect more fearful and deſolate? At firſt ſetting out, they had twenty Miles of a high Sea to croſs in theſe ſcanty Boats; ſo that they were driven before the Wind into the Bottom of the Bay of <hi>Guanipa,</hi> inhabited by inhuman Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals, who ſhot poiſon'd Arrows: And from thence to enter one of the Rivers of which <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> had brought Tidings. After four Days, they were paſt ebbing and flowing, and might have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a whole Year about, and never been able to extricate themſelves, in ſuch a general Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Rendezvous of Streams were they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder'd; and ſo reſembling one another, as not to be diſtinguiſh'd; but imperceptibly circulating and driving them about into the ſame Places where they had been before; paſſing between many Iſlands and Streights, whoſe Borders were ſo thickly arched and over-ſhadowed with Trees, as bounded their Sight to the Breadth of the River and Length of the Avenue, while the Gloomineſs of the Proſpect added Horror to the Loneſomeneſs of the Place. At length, on the 22d of <hi>May</hi> 1595, they fell into a River; which, becauſe it had no Name, they call'd the <hi>Red-croſs River,</hi> theſe being the firſt Chriſtians who ever enter'd the ſame. When they drew into the Creek, which led to a Town upon this River, their <hi>Indian</hi> Pilot, named <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando,</hi> landing, was ſet upon by his Countrymen, who hunted him with Dogs; whereupon <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſeiz'd an old Man paſſing that Way, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd to cut off his Head if he would not procure his Pilot's Liberty: But he, by his Agility, ſoon
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0181500200:169"/>
eſcaped them, and ſwam to <hi>Ralegh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> Barge: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they kept the old Man, and uſed him kindly, aſſuring themſelves of uſeful Information from a Native ſo long converſant in thoſe Parts. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but for this Accident, they had never found their Way forward to the Country they ſought, nor back to that where their Ships lay; the old Man himſelf being often in the utmoſt Perplexity which River to take, ſo numerous and intricate they were. Thoſe People who dwell in the flooded Lands of this <hi>inſular</hi> and broken World, or in all the Tracts towards <hi>Guiana,</hi> which the eight Branches of the <hi>Orenoque</hi> faſhion into Iſlands, are generally called <hi>Tivitivas,</hi> but diſtinguiſhed into two Tribes, a hardy and valiant Generation; who, though they inhabited Houſes on the Ground in Summer, yet in Winter were forced to reſide in the Trees, where they built themſelves artificial Towns, and whoſe Families were to be ſeen lodg'd in an Arm or Branch of thoſe aireal or vegetable Tenements; for between <hi>May</hi> and <hi>September</hi> thoſe Iſlands are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd in ſome Places twenty Foot high by the ſaid grand River of <hi>Orenoque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Departing from this Quarter of the <hi>Tivitivas,</hi> which was under the Diviſion or Tribe call'd <hi>Ciawana,</hi> he kept paſſing up the River with the Flood, and anchoring in the Ebb; yet the third Day of his entering the River aforeſaid his Galley run a-ground, and ſtuck ſo faſt, they all thought their Diſcovery was at an End, and that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Number of them muſt live like Rooks, and build their Neſts in the Boughs; but, after empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Ballaſt, and much Labour, they got her a float at the End of the fourth Day, and ſtruck into another River call'd the <hi>Great Amana,</hi> ſpacious and without winding, being one of the faireſt Branches of the grand <hi>Orenoque:</hi> But here the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0181500200:170"/>
Flood of the Sea left them, and every Man, from the higheſt to the loweſt, was forced to tug by turns at the Oar for ſeveral Days, againſt a rapid Current, and in a moſt ſultry Clime; for they were now in five Degrees of the <hi>Line.</hi> Many goodly Rivulets they paſs'd on either Side, which <hi>Ralegh</hi> nam'd in his Map, and ſhewed their Riſe and Deſcent. When three Days more were paſſed over, his Company began as well to deſpair at the Length of the Way, as to languiſh through exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Heat; and well might their Courage, now their Proviſion alſo began to fail; yet now had they moſt need of Strength and Vigour, when the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the River grew moſt boiſterous and violent againſt them. Here <hi>Ralegh</hi> had a great Taſk to keep up the Spirits of his diſconſolate Companions, which could not be done without being ever foremoſt to endure Labour, and the laſt who gratify'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Refreſhment. He alſo ſtrictly commanded his Pilots to promiſe and End every next Day; which honeſt Deceit he uſed ſo often, they were forced to aſſure it would be at every Reach.</p>
            <p>Thus while he was giving them Hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Land where their Patience ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with Plenty. Providence ſeems to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded his Truſt in her, by happily ſhifting the Scene, and preſenting the moſt beautiful Landſkip they had ever beheld. For here Mountains, crowned with Garlands of fruitful Trees, invited one Senſe; and verdant Plains of many Miles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, enamelled with Groups of odorous Flowers, regaled another. Birds of ſuch Sorts and Colours as they had never ſeen, tempted them to ſupply themſelves by their Fowling Pieces; and Fiſhes of various Kinds, by their Nets; without which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little or no Bread, and leſs Drink, only the thick and troubled Water of the River, they had
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0181500200:171"/>
been in the greateſt Extremity. Now the old <hi>Ciawanian</hi> they had taken (as before-mention'd) perſuading them he would lead them to a Town up the Branch of a River on the right Hand, where they might be ſupplied with all Conveniencies, and return before Night; <hi>Ralegh</hi> leaving his Galley, took eight Muſketiers in his Barge, and with <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Calfield</hi> in their Wherries, having eight Muſketiers more, enter'd the Mouth of that River; but rowed till Sun ſet, and ſaw no Sign of the Town even till they were forty Miles diſtant from the Galley, and the Rowers were ready to give up the Ghoſt. They had certainly hang'd this Pilot, but that their Neceſſities were his Security; for it was quite dark, and they knew not their Way back again; but as they proceeded, the River grew ſo narrow, and was ſo over-ſpread with Trees from Side to Side, that they were all forc'd with their Swords to cut a Way for their Oars. About One a-Clock after Midnight they diſcern'd a Light, and heard the Barking of Dogs; ſoon after they found the Village, and there they were ſtored with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, according to the Promiſes of the old Pilot. In the mean Time, the Company in the Galley mann'd out a Boat in Search of them; but next Day they return'd, and continu'd their Courſe, after they had made this hungry and hazardous Voyage for fourſcore Miles in that River; which, beſides other ſtrange Fiſhes of marvellous Bigneſs, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe ugly Serpents call'd <hi>Crocodiles;</hi> whence the People nam'd it the River of <hi>Lagartos. Ralegh</hi> had a young Negro attending upon him in his Galley, who, leaping out to ſwim in the Mouth of this River, was, in the Sight of them all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly devour'd by one of theſe amphibious Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. Not long after, being again in Want of Victuals, they took two Canoes laden with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0181500200:172"/>
Bread, being run aſhore by the <hi>Indians</hi> in them call'd <hi>Arwacas,</hi> who fled to hide themſelves in the Woods; fearing, through the Prepoſſeſſions of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that <hi>Ralegh</hi> and his Company were <hi>Canibals. Ralegh</hi> purſuing them, in Hopes of ſome Intelligence, found, as he was creeping thro' the Buſhes, a Refiner's Baſket, there being in it Quickſilver, Saltpetre, and divers other Materials, for the Trial of Metals; and alſo the Duſt of ſome Ore that had been refin'd: but in two other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes which eſcaped them, they heard of a good Quantity of Ore and Gold. <hi>Ralegh</hi> then landed more Men, and offered 500 <hi>l.</hi> to any of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who ſhould take one of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom they thought to have alſo landed in theſe laſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes; but they eſcaped while he was purſuing the former: However, while he was in Search of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he found the <hi>Arwacas</hi> hidden in the Woods, who had been Pilots for the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> of which <hi>Ralegh</hi> kept the chief for his Pilot, and carried him to <hi>Guiana;</hi> by whom he underſtood in what Parts the <hi>Spaniards</hi> labour'd for Gold, which he divulged to few of his Company, knowing both the Seaſon of the Year and other Conveniencies would be wanting to work any Mine himſelf. Therefore he haſted away from this Place, his Purpoſe being at that Time rather to diſcover what he could of the Country, and win over the People to Subjection. Beſides this Reſtraint from all Greedineſs after their Gold, there was another Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue he no leſs ſtrictly obſerv'd, which highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him in the Eſteem of all thoſe <hi>Indians.</hi> For, whereas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were wont to ſatisfy their Luſts without Controul upon their Wives and Daughters, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſuffer'd not a Man of his ſo much as to touch any of their Women. <hi>I proteſt (ſays he) before the Majeſty of the living God, that</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0181500200:173"/>
               <hi>I neither knew, nor believe that any of our Company, one or other, by Violence or otherwiſe, ever knew any of their Women; and yet we ſaw many Hundreds, and had many in our Power, and of thoſe very young and excellently favour'd, which came among us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deceit, ſtark naked.</hi> And becauſe he found it a very troubleſome Work to keep the meaner Sort from pilfering and Spoil, when they went to any of the <hi>Indians</hi> Houſes, <hi>Ralegh</hi> cauſed his Interpreter at every Place, when they departed, to enquire after the Loſſes or Wrongs that had been done; and if he found any Thing had been ſtolen or taken by Violence, either the ſame was reſtored, and the Party puniſh'd in their Sight, or elſe it was paid for to their utmoſt Demand.</p>
            <p>After he was recruited with Bread and other Proviſions, which greatly encouraged his Men, who now cry'd out, <hi>Let us go on, we care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not how far; Ralegh</hi> ſent back in one of the Canoes the old <hi>Ciawan,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> his firſt Pilot; giving them ſuch Things as they deſir'd for their Voyage, and wrote a Letter to his Ships, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, and then he went on under the Pilotage of one of thoſe <hi>Arwacas</hi> he had taken, whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had chriſten'd <hi>Martin.</hi> But the next or ſecond Day after, they run a-ground again with their Galley, and ſhe was very near being caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with their new Store of Victuals; they lay on the Sand one whole Night, and were in far greater Deſpair of diſengaging her than before, becauſe they had no Tide of Flood to help them. In the Midſt of their Fears, they bethought them of faſtening an Anchor upon the Land, and with main Strength drew her off. So the fifteenth Day (of their Abſence from their Ships) they diſcover'd at a Diſtance, to their great Joy, the Mountains of <hi>Guiana;</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening were brought by a northerly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0181500200:174"/>
Gale in Sight of the great <hi>Orenoque,</hi> which they ſoon after enter'd; a River of vaſt Extent and Magnitude, lying moſtly Eaſt and Weſt even from the Sea to <hi>Quito</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> thought to be 300 Miles wide at the Mouth, 1000 Miles navigable for Ships, 2000 for leſſer Veſſels, and diſcharging it ſelf by ſixteen Arms into the Sea, whereby many Parts of the <hi>Spaniſh Indies</hi> might moſt eaſily be invaded. From other Obſervations, it appears in many Places of the Channel to be twenty Fathom deep; and in few that are ſhoally, leſs than two and a half. It was called by the ſucceeding Voyagers to this Place, in Honour of Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> after his Name. One of them gives his Reaſon for it in theſe Words: <hi>Of the Worthineſs of this River becauſe I cannot ſay enough, I will ſpeak nothing; we have preſumed to call it by the Name of</hi> RALEANA, <hi>becauſe your ſelf was the firſt of our Nation who ever enter'd the ſame.</hi> Now when <hi>Ralegh</hi> had procur'd one of the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Princes, named <hi>Toparimaca,</hi> a ſkilful old Pilot, who was his Brother, and who perfectly knew this River, he ſailed up a Branch thereof, having on the left Hand a great Iſland which they call <hi>Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pana;</hi> and thence along the Banks of ſeveral other Iſlands, which they choſe rather to anchor at than by the main Land, becauſe of the Tortoiſes Eggs found there in Abundance, to their great Relief; and for the Convenience of caſting their Nets from the Rocks, of a blue metalline Colour, which look'd like Steel-ore. So keeping always weſtward up the River, there open'd after a while a Land on the right Side, which appear'd a ſpacious Champaign, and the Banks perfectly red. <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſent Captain <hi>Giffard, Thynn, Calfield,</hi> his Couſins <hi>Greenvil</hi> and <hi>Batſhead Gorges;</hi> alſo his Nephew <hi>John Gilbert</hi> and ſome others, with a Guard of Soldiers, to march over the Banks, and diſcover what Proſpect it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0181500200:175"/>
and finding it a Level of an unbounded Space, it proved, as their Pilot inform'd them, the Plains of <hi>Saima,</hi> reaching to <hi>Cumana</hi> and <hi>Caracas</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which are a hundred and twenty Leagues to the North, and inhabited by four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Nations, whereof one were the <hi>Aroras,</hi> as black as Negroes, but of ſmooth Hair; a deſperate People, uſing the ſtrongeſt and moſt deadly Poiſon of all others on their Arrows. <hi>Ralegh</hi> was moſt curious to know the Compoſition of this Poiſon, and what Remedies could be had againſt the dreadful Effects of it. For, beſides the Mortality of the Wound, the Patient is afflicted with moſt inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Torment, and accompanied with ſuch irkſome Symptoms, that the Phyſician cannot abide the Cure. None of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could ever extort this Secret either by Kindneſs or Cruelty; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but few of the <hi>Indians,</hi> beſides their Prieſts and Soothſayers, knew it. <note n="*" place="bottom">Whether the Poiſon they uſed in <hi>Guiana</hi> was the ſame with that in ſome other Parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies, Ralegh</hi> has not told us; but Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> informs us, that about <hi>Cumana,</hi> where they are very expert Archers, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'their Poiſon is of ſuch Force, that a Man being ſtruck therewith, dies in twenty-four Hours; and, that in his Judgment, there can be no ſtronger; uſing thereunto Apples, which are fair and red of Colour; but are a ſtrong Poiſon (perhaps the <hi>Manchineil)</hi> of which with veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bats, Vipers, Adders, and other Serpents, they make a Medley, and anoint their Arrows.'</q>
               </note>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi> was therefore more beholden to the <hi>Guianians</hi> than any Body; for <hi>Antonio de Berrio</hi> told him, that he could never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Knowledge thereof. <hi>And yet they taught me (ſays</hi> Ralegh) <hi>the beſt Way of healing this, as well as all other Poiſons.</hi> Then he tells us thoſe Medicines which are vulgar, and ſerve for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Poiſon, are made of the Juice of a Root call'd <hi>Tupara,</hi> which alſo marvellouſly quenches the Heat of burning Fevers, and heals inward
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0181500200:176"/>
Wounds; and that thoſe of common poiſon'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows were wont to be heal'd by ſome of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> with the Juice of Garlic. But this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates as a general Rule for all Men that ſhall hereafter travel the <hi>Indies</hi> where poiſon'd Arrows are uſed, that they abſtain from Drink; for if they take any Liquor into their Body, whereunto they will be exceedingly provoked by Drought, and drink before the Wound is dreſs'd, or immediately upon it, there is no Relief but preſent Death.</p>
            <p>After having paſſed the Mountain <hi>Aio,</hi> and a great Iſland, which he mentions, he reached on the fifth Day of his entering the great River afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, as high as the Province of <hi>Aromaia,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring at the Port of <hi>Morequito,</hi> which is 300 Miles within the Land, upon the ſaid great River <hi>Orenoque,</hi> he ſent a Meſſenger to the old King of <hi>Aromaia,</hi> named <hi>Topiowary,</hi> who came the next Day before Noon on Foot from his Houſe, and returned the ſame Evening, being 28 Miles back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, though himſelf was 110 Years of Age. He had many Attendants of both Sexes, who came alſo to wonder at the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and brought them great Plenty of Fleſh, Fowl and Fiſh, with divers Sorts of Fruits, and among them abundance of <hi>Pinas,</hi> the moſt excellent of all Kinds <note n="*" place="bottom">Whether <hi>Ralegh,</hi> at his Return, brought of this Fruit into <hi>England,</hi> which is otherwiſe called the <hi>Ananas,</hi> and vulgarly the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Wine, and a Sort of Parroquites no bigger than Wrens. And one of them preſented <hi>Ralegh</hi> with a little Beaſt, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Armadilla,</hi> having his Body ſcaled or plated over like the <hi>Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros,</hi> with a white Horn growing in his hinder Parts as big as a hunting Horn. This Horn is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in Medicine, and the Fleſh for Food, ſince <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſoon after made a Feaſt of it.</p>
            <p>When the old King had reſted himſelf a while in a Tent which <hi>Ralegh</hi> had cauſed to be pitched for him, they entered, by the Interpreter, into Diſcourſe about the Murder of <hi>Morequito,</hi> his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, and the other Violations of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Then <hi>Ralegh</hi> acquainted him with the Cauſe of his coming thither, whoſe Servant he was, and that it was his Queen's Pleaſure he ſhould undertake this Voyage to deliver them from the Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> dilating at large on her Majeſty's Power, Juſtice, and Clemency towards all oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nations: all which, being with great Reverence and Attention received, he began to ſound the old Man touching <hi>Guiana;</hi> as what Sort of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth it was, how governed, of what Strength and Policy, of what Extent; with whom in Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Enmity; laſtly, the Diſtance and Way to enter the Heart of the Country? The King gave ſuch ample and perfect Account of theſe Particulars, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> wondered to find a Man of ſuch Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Judgment, and good Diſcourſe, without the Help of Learning or Breeding. After his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſailed weſtward to view the famous River <hi>Caroli,</hi> both becauſe it was ſo wonderful in itſelf, and led to the ſtrongeſt Nations of all the Frontiers, who were Enemies to the <hi>Epuremei,</hi> ſubjects to the <hi>Inga,</hi> or Emperor of <hi>Guiana</hi> and <hi>Manoa.</hi> Even when he was ſhort of it, or lower down than the Port of <hi>Morequito,</hi> he heard the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0181500200:178"/>
roaring Falls of this River; but when he entered it with his Barge and Wherries, thinking to have gone up ſome 40 Miles to the <hi>Caſſipagotos,</hi> he was not able with a Barge of eight Oars to row one Stone's Throw in an Hour; and yet the River is as broad as the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Woolwich.</hi> Therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping on the Banks, he ſent off an <hi>Indian</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Nations upon the River of his Arrival, and his Purpoſe; and that he deſired to ſee the Lords of <hi>Canuria,</hi> who dwelt in that Province. Then one of the Princes came down, named <hi>Wanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retona,</hi> with many of his People, and brought great Store of Proviſions, as the reſt had done. By him <hi>Ralegh</hi> found, the <hi>Carolians</hi> were not only Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but moſt of all to the <hi>Epuremei,</hi> who abounded in Gold; and that there were three mighty Nations at the Head of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which would join him againſt them. He was further informed by one Capt. <hi>George,</hi> whom he had taken with <hi>Berreo,</hi> that near the Banks of this River there was a great Silver Mine; but the Rivers were all now ſo riſen, that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Strength of Man with any Boat to row againſt the Stream. Therefore he diſpatched a Party between 30 and 40 to coaſt the River by Land, while himſelf, with two or three Officers and half a dozen Shot, marched over-land to view the ſtrange and wonderful Overfalls of the ſaid Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Caroli,</hi> which roared at ſuch a Diſtance, and the Plains adjoining, with the Reſt of the Province of <hi>Canuri.</hi> When they had got to the Top of the firſt Hills over-looking the River, they beheld that prodigious Breach of Waters which poured down <hi>Caroli,</hi> and how it ran in three Streams for 20 Miles together. No leſs than 10 or 12 of theſe ſteep Cataracts appeared in Sight, each as high above the other as a Church-tower; which ruſhed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0181500200:179"/>
down with ſuch Violence, that the very Rebound of the Waters made the Place ſeem as if it had been all over covered with a great Shower of Rain. And here <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſays, he never ſaw a more beautiful Country, nor more lively Proſpects; the Hills ſo raiſed up and down about the Valleys; the Waters winding into ſuch various Branches; the Plains ſo clear of Buſh and Stubble, and covered all with fair green Graſs; the Ground of hard Sand, and eaſy for the March either of Horſe or Foot; the Deer croſſing in every Path; the Birds, towards the Evening, ſinging on every Tree a thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Tunes, with Cranes and Herons of white, crimſon and Carnation, pearched along the River Banks; the Air refreſhed with gentle eaſterly Breezes; and every Stone they ſtooped to take up, promiſing either Gold or Silver by its Complexion. His Company, at their return, brought ſeveral of theſe Stones home; which they rather found co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured outwardly like Gold, than any of that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fixed in them; for thoſe who had leaſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Experience, kept only ſuch as glittered, and would not be perſuaded but they were rich, becauſe they ſhone, thereby bred an Opinion, that all the Reſt were no better. Yet ſome of theſe Stones <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſhewed afterwards to a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of the <hi>Caraccas,</hi> who told him it was <hi>El madre del oro,</hi> that is, <hi>the Mother of Gold;</hi> and that the Mine was further in the Ground.</p>
            <p>Among the goodly Rivers beyond the <hi>Caroli,</hi> there is one name <hi>Caora.</hi> Upon this Branch, it was atteſted to <hi>Ralegh</hi> by the moſt intelligent and credible Chiefs of the adjacent Parts, there dwelt a Nation of People whoſe Heads appear not above their Shoulders; which, becauſe every Body in the Provinces of <hi>Aromaia</hi> and <hi>Canuri</hi> alſo affirmed, he was inclined to believe. They are called <hi>Ewaipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noma,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0181500200:180"/>
and reported to have their Eyes in their Shoulders, and Mouths in their Breaſts (or in a level with them). It was further avouched to him, they uſed Bows, Arrows, and Clubs thrice as big as any of the <hi>Guianians;</hi> and that one being taken Priſoner the Year before was brought into <hi>Aromata.</hi> When <hi>Ralegh</hi> doubted of ſuch a Race to the Prince, hereafter-mentioned, who came with him into <hi>England,</hi> he anſwered, it was no wonder among them; for they had lately ſlain many Hundreds of his Father's People. <hi>Ralegh</hi> obſerves, <hi>That</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devill <hi>had before written of ſuch a Nation; and that, ſince the</hi> Eaſt-Indian <hi>Diſcoveries, we find his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations true, which were before held incredible.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that when he afterwards arrived at <hi>Cumana,</hi> he ſpoke with a <hi>Spaniard</hi> eminent for his Travels, and withal for his Credit and Veracity; who, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had been as far in <hi>Guiana</hi> as <hi>Caroli,</hi> immediately aſked him if he had ſeen thoſe People, and declared he had ſeen many of them. Then <hi>Ralegh</hi> names ſome <hi>French</hi> Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> who were there preſent, and heard what this <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> had thus aſſerted. <hi>Whether it is true or no (ſays he) the Matter is not great, neither can there be any Profit in the Imagination; for my own Part, I ſaw them not; but an reſolved, that ſo many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not all combine or fore think to make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi> After all, whether the Obſervation of any Garment looſely riſing above the Shoulders of theſe People, or the crouching Poſture in which they were ſo much ſeen, by their conſtant Exerciſe of Archery, might not firſt give ſome Riſe to this Report, I leave for others more largely to explain <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Theobald</hi> thinks, we may be able to account, in a few Lines, for the Myſtery of theſe ſuppoſed headleſs People: For <hi>Olearius</hi> ſpeaking (ſays he) of the Manner of Cloathing of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mojeds.</hi> a People of North <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Their Garments are made like thoſe called <hi>Coſaques,</hi> open only at the Necks, When the Cold is extraordinary, they put their <hi>Coſaques</hi> over their Heads, and let the Sleeves hang down, their Faces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be ſeen, but at the Cleft, which is at the Neck; whence ſome have taken occaſion to write, that in theſe <hi>nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Countries, there are People without Heads, having their Faces in their Breaſts.'</q>

This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration may be further offer'd for what <hi>Ralegh</hi> alſo repeats, not only from the Writers of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, concerning the modern <hi>Amazons</hi> in theſe Parts, but from their very Neighbours. For hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told us, that <hi>Orellana</hi> firſt diſcover'd <hi>Maran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which is call'd the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and alſo after the ſaid Diſcoverers own Name, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was inquiſitive to know whether there were any of thoſe warlike Women, from whom this River ſhould be ſo call'd, in theſe <hi>American</hi> Parts, who are ſo fam'd in antient Hiſtories to have been in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> and was aſſur'd by an antient <hi>Caſique,</hi> that there was ſuch a Nation of Women on the South of the ſaid River, in the Provinces of <hi>Topago,</hi> whoſe Manners and Cuſtoms, as they deſcrib'd to him, did ſomewhat conform with what is recorded of the antient <hi>Amazons:</hi> As, they cohabited with Men but one Month in the Year; ſent them the male Children, and kept only the Females; <hi>but that they cut off their Right Breaſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I do not find to be true.</hi> He was further told, they ſcrupled not to accompany with the Priſoners they took in War at any Time; but in the End con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly put them to Death: And that, as others of the bordering Nations, theſe Women wore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Plates of Gold, which they had ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd

            <p>When <hi>Ralegh,</hi> with his Company, lay at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor on the Coaſt of <hi>Canuri,</hi> and had taken Knowledge of all the Nations upon the Head and Branches of the <hi>Caroli;</hi> and found out many Tribes who were Enemies to the <hi>Epuremei</hi> and the new Conquerors, having now wander'd for near a Month, diſtant from his Ships above 400 Miles; beſides the long Digreſſions up many Arms and Branches on every Side by the Way, they found the Winter Seaſon advance apace, <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>As he return'd to the Eaſt, he ſpent ſome Time in diſcovering the River towards the Sea which he had not ſurvey'd. In a Day's Time he arriv'd again at the Port of <hi>Morequito;</hi> for, gliding down the Stream, he went without Labour, tho' againſt the Wind, little leſs than a hundred Miles a Day. When he came to Anchor, he was very deſirous of ſome further Conference with old <hi>Topiowari,</hi> who ſoon, upon Notice, came, with a Multitude of his People, flocking down to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Tent upon the Shore, every one loaded with Preſents. When the old King was refreſh'd, and the Crown retir'd, <hi>Ralegh,</hi> by his Interpreter, enter'd into a long Conference with him; telling him that as both the <hi>Epuremei</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were his Enemies; the one having conquer'd <hi>Guiana</hi> already, and the other endeavour'd to get it from both, he deſir'd to be inſtructed both in the beſt Ways to the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Parts of <hi>Guiana,</hi> and the civiliz'd Towns, or apparell'd People of <hi>Inga.</hi> The King anſwer'd,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0181500200:184"/>
he could not perceive <hi>Ralegh</hi> meant to proceed to the great City of <hi>Manoa,</hi> becauſe neither the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year nor the Strength of his Company would enable him; for he remember'd that in the Plains of <hi>Maqureguarai,</hi> the firſt civil Town of <hi>Guiana,</hi> where all the Gold Plates were made which were ſcatter'd over the neighbouring Nations, and about four Days Journey from his own, 300 <hi>Spaniards</hi> were deſtroy'd, who had no Friends among the Borderers; therefore adviſed <hi>Ralegh</hi> never to invade the ſtrong Parts of <hi>Guiana,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Help of all thoſe Nations which were their Enemies. <hi>Ralegh</hi> aſk'd, if he thought the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he had with him were ſufficient to take that Town: The King thought they were, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to aſſiſt him with all his Borderers, if he would leave him a Guard of fifty Men upon his Departure; but <hi>Ralegh</hi> knowing if they ſhould eſcape the <hi>Guanians,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> expecting Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, would repay upon them this Treatment at <hi>Trinidad,</hi> very plauſibly excus'd himſelf. Hereupon the King deſir'd he would forbear him and his Country at this Time; for if the <hi>Epuremei</hi> ſhould know he had given <hi>Ralegh</hi> any Aid or Intelligence, he ſhould ſoon be over-run by them; nor could he avoid the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if they ſhould return, who had before led him 17 Days in a Chain like a Dog, till he paid 100 Plates of Gold and ſeveral Chains of Spleen-ſtones for his Ranſom; but if <hi>Ralegh</hi> would return in due Seaſon next Year, he would engage all the Borderers in the Enterpriſe; for that he could not more deſire to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Guiana,</hi> than they to aſſiſt him; having been plunder'd by the <hi>Epuremei</hi> of their Women, whom to recover they would willingly renew the War, without Hopes of further Profit; for the old King complain'd of it as a Matter of grievous Reſtraint,

that now they were confin'd to three or four Wives a piece, who were wont to enjoy ten or a dozen; while the Lords of their Enemies had no leſs than 50 or 100. But they ſeem to have had a political Reaſon for this Recovery, to ſtrengthen their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance and encreaſe their Forces, theſe Frontiers having been much depopulated between the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Inga</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards. Ralegh,</hi> finding it abſolutely improper either to leave any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or attempt War upon the <hi>Epuremei</hi> till the next Year, apply'd himſelf now only to learn how theſe People wrought thoſe Plates of Gold which were diſpers'd about, and how they divided it from the Stone. The King told him, that moſt of their Plates and Images were not ſever'd from the Stone; but that on the Lake of <hi>Manoa,</hi> and many other Rivers thereabouts, they gather'd the perfect Grains of Gold, and mingling a Proportion of Copper, the better to work it, put it in a great earthen Pot, under which they encreas'd the Fire by the Breath of Men, through long Canes faſten'd to the Holes round the ſaid Pot, till the Metal diſſolv'd, which then they caſt into Moulds of Stone and Clay, and ſo made thoſe Plates and Images; whereof <hi>Ralegh</hi> brought two Sorts into <hi>England,</hi> more to ſhew the Manner of them than their Value: For he gave more Pieces of Gold of the twenty Shilling Coin, with the Queen's Effigies upon them, among theſe People, to wear in Honour of her Majeſty, and to engage them in her Service, than he receiv'd; ſo little did he make his Deſire of Gold known to them. He alſo brought over ſome Gold Ore of their Mines, <hi>whereof I know ſome is as rich</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as any the Earth yields, and of which I know there is ſufficient, if nothing elſe were to be hop'd for;</hi> but they wanted Time, Hands and Inſtruments to break the Ground, without which there could be

no working of Mines. <hi>We ſaw</hi> (adds he) <hi>all the Hills with Stones of the Colour of Gold and Silver, and we try'd them to be no</hi> Marqueſite; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as the</hi> Spaniards <hi>call</hi> El madre del oro, <hi>or, the Mother of Gold, which is an undoubted Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the general Abundance thereof; and myſelf ſaw the outſide of many Mines of the</hi> Sparre, <hi>which I know to be the ſame that all covet in this World; and of thoſe, more than I will ſpeak of.</hi> Now <hi>Ralegh,</hi> beſides having learn'd the Riches of the Country, having alſo won the Affections of the People, and receiv'd a faithful Promiſe of the Chiefs in thoſe Provinces of <hi>Aromaia</hi> and <hi>Canuri</hi> to become Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to her Majeſty, took his Leave of old <hi>Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owari,</hi> and receiv'd his Son Prince <hi>Cayworaco</hi> as a Pledge betwixt them, whom he brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he was chriſten'd <hi>Gualtero</hi> with great Solemnity, leaving with the old King two of his own People in Exchange; the one named <hi>Francis Sparrow,</hi> who being a good Draughtſman, and could deſcribe a Country with his Pen, deſir'd to be left for that Purpoſe, whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> inſtructed to travel as far as he could to <hi>Manoa</hi> with ſuch Merchandiſe as he committed to his Care; the other was a Boy, who waited upon him, named <hi>Hugh Goodwin,</hi> for whom he left Orders to be taught the Language of the Country. This done, he weigh'd Anchor, and coaſted the River on <hi>Guiana</hi>-ſide, becauſe he came towards it on the North-ſide by the Lawns of <hi>Saima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a powerful Caſique named <hi>Putijma,</hi> who accompanied <hi>Ralegh</hi> and his Men from <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maia,</hi> with Promiſes to lead them to a Mountain call'd <hi>Iconuri,</hi> which contain'd a Mine of Gold; and which (ſays <hi>Ralegh)</hi> he perform'd. <hi>Ralegh</hi> travell'd a great Way towards it himſelf along the River <hi>Mana,</hi> till, through Wearineſs, he was
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0181500200:187"/>
forced with ſome of his Attendants to reſt on the Banks of a Lake in the delightful Valley of <hi>Oiana;</hi> where one of his Guides kindling a Fire with two Sticks, <note n="*" place="bottom">Succeeding Voyagers have obſerv'd of the <hi>Karaguata Guacu,</hi> a <hi>Braſilian</hi> Free about 14 or 15 Foot high, with yellow Flowers on the Top, and large long thick Leaves, which yield an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous Liquor ſerving for Soap, and Strings for Fiſhing-Nets; that with the Wood thereof, and of another call'd <hi>Imbaiba,</hi> the Inhabitants kindle their Fires by ſtriking them together, as we by a Flint and Steel.</note>they ſtay'd a while to dry their Shirts; ſending Captain <hi>Keymis</hi> the while with a Party un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Caſique</hi> to take Cognizance of the ſaid Mine, and promis'd to meet him at the River <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maca,</hi> in his Way to <hi>Emeria,</hi> the Province of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapara,</hi> one of the greateſt Lords of the <hi>Orenoque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni,</hi> with whom he ſought to eſtabliſh a League. And as <hi>Ralegh</hi> return'd by the River <hi>Mana</hi> towards the ſaid Province, he ſaw himſelf many Rocks like Gold Ore, and on the Left Hand a round Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Mineral Stone. From hence returning down the Stream, he coaſted the Province of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino;</hi> but the Branches of the Rivers he here paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with <hi>Aio</hi> and other Mountains, he reſerv'd to the Repreſentation in his Map; which, for the numerous and diſtant Rivers and Countries therein occaſionally refer'd to, appears to have been a very accurate and comprehenſive Performance.</p>
            <p>In the River of <hi>Winciapora</hi> he ſaw what they call the Mountain of Cryſtal, which look'd at a Diſtance like a white Church-tower of exceeding Height, over the Top of which a mighty River ruſh'd down with prodigious Noiſe. <hi>Berreo</hi> told him, there were Diamonds and other Stones of great Value thereon, which blaz'd at a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Upon this River <hi>Ralegh</hi> reſted a while, and marched to a Town of the ſame Name, where he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0181500200:188"/>
found the Natives all as drunk as Beggars, it being the Time of their Feſtival. Here <hi>Ralegh</hi> refreſh'd himſelf with the Proviſions of the Place, and the delicate Wine of <hi>Pinas.</hi> But underſtanding that <hi>Carapana</hi> was retir'd from <hi>Emeria;</hi> and imagining, becauſe he was an old ſubtil Prince, it was to wait till he ſhould return next Year, then join him, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſtrong enough to tempt his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance; if not, that he might excuſe his Retirement to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as tho' it were in Fear of theſe new Viſitors; <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſpent no more Time in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him; but making to the River <hi>Cumaca,</hi> he met with <hi>Keymis,</hi> and took his Leave of <hi>Putijma,</hi> who, of all others, moſt lamented his Departure; for the <hi>Orenoque</hi> was now ſwoln moſt dreadfully, ſo that it was impoſſible to return by the Way he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, for the River of <hi>Amana</hi> could not be ſailed back by any Means, the Breeze and Current of the Sea were ſo outragious; therefore he follow'd the Branch of <hi>Capuri,</hi> which enter'd into the Sea Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Ships, that he might bear with them before the Wind; and great Need there was ſo to do, having by that Way as much to croſs of the main Sea, in their little Boats, after they came to the River's Mouth, as between <hi>Gravelin</hi> and <hi>Dover.</hi> But when they arrived at the Sea-ſide, and anchor'd in the Mouth of <hi>Capuri,</hi> there aroſe a mighty Storm, and the River's Mouth was at leaſt a League broad, ſo that they run before Night cloſe under the Land with their Boats, and brought the Galley as near as they could, which had much ado to live, and was often near ſinking with all her Men. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> was in the utmoſt Doubt what Courſe to take; either to venture in the Galley through ſix Foot Water on the Sands for two Leagues together, and that in the Channel, when ſhe drew five; or truſt in ſuch a raging Wind and Sea to croſs over in his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0181500200:189"/>
Barge. At laſt, ſeeing the Tempeſt increaſe the longer he tarried, he took <hi>Gifford, Calfield,</hi> and <hi>Greenvil,</hi> in his Barge; and about Midnight thruſt into the Sea, leaving the Galley to come by Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <hi>Thus faintly chearing one another in Shew of Courage (ſays</hi> Ralegh) <hi>it pleaſed God by Nine a-Clock the next Morning we diſcover'd the Iſle of</hi> Trinidad. So they kept along the Shore to <hi>Curia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> where they found their Ships at Anchor; <hi>than which (ſays he) there never was to us a more joyful Sight;</hi> eſpecially when they found, upon meeting together, they had loſt but one Man (before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) through ſo many Extremes of Wet, Heat, Hunger, Want of Reſt, Sleep, Lodging, and ſuch like violent Hardſhips in this toilſome and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Adventure, as drove them to many unuſual and unhealthy Shifts, eſpecially in their Diet; ſuch as feeding upon many ſtrange and corrupted Fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon freſh Fiſh without ſeaſoning; <hi>Crocodiles, Sea-cows,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Of theſe Sea-monſters, otherwiſe call'd <hi>Manati</hi> by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, Ralegh</hi> ſays he had ſeen as big as a Wine-pipe; others deſcribe its Fleſh to be like Beef, and to yield and excellent Oil, the Hide being dreſs'd, makes good Buff, and dried, good Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets or Armour; wherefore, we are told, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> brought ſeveral of theſe Hides into <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Antas,</hi> and <hi>armed Hogs;</hi> upon all Sorts, of the Land or Water; good and bad; without Order or Meaſure: and yet no <hi>Calenture</hi> befel them, or other peſtilent Diſeaſes which are wont to infect all Regions ſo near the <hi>Line;</hi> ſo wholeſome was the Country, or ſo happily ſuited to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
            <p>In his Return homewards he touch'd at <hi>Cumana,</hi> to ſtore and refreſh himſelf with ſuch Proviſions as he wanted, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> refuſed to ſupply him, at which he threatned the Town; and upon their refuſing alſo to ſave it by ſuch reaſonable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0181500200:190"/>
Ranſom as they had juſt before offer'd Captain <hi>Preſton,</hi> he ſet it on Fire; the like he did at <hi>St. Mary,</hi> and at <hi>Rio de la Hach,</hi> as we are informed by <hi>Camden</hi> and others; ſome of whom affirm, he got not only great Glory hereby, but Riches; the latter of which will be thought doubtful to thoſe who have read the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had removed their Effects to the Mountains, before they entered into a Capitulation with <hi>Preſton.</hi> On the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> when the ſaid Captain <hi>Preſton,</hi> with the reſt of his Company, were under <hi>Cape St. Anthony,</hi> the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Part of the Iſle of <hi>Cuba, we met (ſays the Writer of his Voyage) with the honourable Knight Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>returning from</hi> his painful and happy Diſcovery of <hi>Guiana, and his Surpriſe of the Iſle of</hi> Trinidad; <hi>ſo with glad Hearts we kept him and his Fleet of three Ships Company (for he mentions no more) till the twentieth Day at Night, at which Time we loſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Ralegh</hi> was arrived in <hi>England,</hi> he ſoon applied himſelf to digeſt the Obſervations he had made in his Diſcoveries, and they were, not many Months after, committed to the Preſs. Several Authors have beſtowed Characters in Praiſe of this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which manifeſts ſuch a wonderful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius in compaſſing the Knowledge of ſo many Places, Productions, and People, with ſo ſmall a Power, and in ſo ſhort a Time.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ralegh</hi> with all his Zeal and Aſſiduity for the Honour and Advantage of his Country, could never induce the State to proceed in the Plantation of <hi>Guiana;</hi> not ſo much through any real Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the Emoluments that would accrue from it; as through that malignant Jealouſy which ſo eternally biaſs'd the domeſtic Competitors for Royal Favour, to curb the foreign Services of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing Men, leſt the Atchievments of the one
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0181500200:191"/>
ſhould outſhine the Adminiſtrations of the other; whence we may here obſerve, that he, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Qualities had gain'd him ſuch Influence, ſuch an Aſcendency over the moſt ſavage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiliz'd Nations, found no Diſpoſitions ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and intractable among thoſe Strangers, as he did in his own Country; like <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf, who having, by his glorious Labours, ſhewed his Power of ſubduing and taming all other Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, found Envy and Detraction invincible at laſt. That <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Labours were attended with the ſame Fate, himſelf has ſufficiently diſcover'd in that <hi>Dedication,</hi> which, with ſo much Eloquence, Modeſty, and Generoſity, he made of his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> upon <hi>Guiana</hi> aforeſaid, to the Lord-admiral <hi>Howard</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Cecyl.</hi> For notwithſtanding the Difficulties and Dangers of the Voyage, <hi>it appears (ſays</hi> Ralegh <hi>therein) that I made no other Brava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do of going to Sea than was meant, and that I was never hidden in</hi> Cornwal <hi>or elſewhere, as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. They have groſly belied me, that fore judged I would rather become a Servant to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>King than return; and the reſt were much miſtaken, who would have perſuaded that I was too eaſeful and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual to undertake a Journey of ſo great Travel; but (as he generouſly continues) if what I have done re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gracious Conſtruction of a painful Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and purchaſe the leaſt Remiſſion, I ſhall think all too little, and that there were wanting to the reſt many Miſeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Ralegh</hi> was in Hopes it would appear there was now a Way found out to anſwer every Man's longing; a richer <hi>Indies</hi> than any the King of <hi>Spain</hi> enjoyed, which if the Queen would patronize, he was willing to end the Remainder of his Days in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it to a total Subjection. Whatever he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advanced of this Kind, Diffidence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0181500200:192"/>
were ſo predominant, that becauſe ſome of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Company brought over <hi>Marcaſite</hi> for Gold, as he informs us a little further, there were ſome who woud not believe the real Gold-ore which he brought, and which he had helped to dig out of the Rocks with his own Dagger, was of greater Value. Nay, when many Trials had been made of this Ore, wherein ſome Quantities were proved by one <hi>Weſtwood,</hi> a Refiner in <hi>Wood-ſtreet,</hi> to hold after the Rate of twelve or thirteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds a Ton. Other Parcels, by Mr. <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Dimock,</hi> Aſſay-maſter, found alſo to hold after the Rate of twenty-three thouſand Pounds the Ton; and a third Sort tried by Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller of the <hi>Mint,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dimock</hi> in <hi>Goldſmith</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> holding after the Rate of twenty-ſix thouſand nine hundred Pounds the Ton; who tried alſo ſome Gold-duſt of the ſame Mine, which held eight Pound ſix Ounces weight of Gold in the Hundred, and an Image of Copper made in <hi>Guiana,</hi> which held a third Part of Gold; when all this was prov'd, there were thoſe who would not yet believe it Gold of <hi>Guiana;</hi> but that <hi>Ralegh</hi> purchas'd it upon the <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, and caried it over thither. <hi>Surely the Singularity of that Device (ſays</hi> Ralegh) <hi>I do not well comprehend: For my own Part, I am not ſo much in love with theſe long Voyages, as to deviſe thereby to couſen myſelf; to lie hard, to fare worſe, to be ſubject to Perils, to Diſeaſes, to ill Savours, to be parch'd and wither'd, and withal, to ſuſtain the Care and Labour of ſuch an Enterpriſe; except the ſame had more Comfort than the fetching of</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſite <hi>in</hi> Guiana, <hi>or buying of Gold-ore in</hi> Barbary. <hi>But I hope the better Sort will judge me by themſelves, and that the Way of Deceit is not the Way of Honour or good Opinion. I have herein conſumed much Time and many Crowns, and I had no other Reſpect or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0181500200:193"/>
               <hi>than to ſerve her Majeſty and my Country thereby. If the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Nation had been of the like Belief with theſe Detractors, we ſhould little have fear'd or doubted their Attempts wherewith we now are daily threaten'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we now conſider of the Actions both of <hi>Charles V.</hi> who had the Maidenhead of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the abundant Treaſures of <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> together with the Affairs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King now living; what he has added to the Acts of his Predeceſſors; how many Kingdoms he has endangered; how many Armies, Garriſons and Navies he maintains; the great Loſſes he has repaired, as in <hi>Eighty-Eight,</hi> above <hi>100</hi> Sail of great Ships, with their Artillery; and that no Year is leſs unfortunate, but that many Veſſels, Treaſures and People are devoured; and yet that he begins again, like a Storm, to threaten Shipwreck to us all; we ſhall find that theſe Abilities ariſe not from the Trades of <hi>Sack</hi> and <hi>Seville-oranges,</hi> nor from ought elſe that either <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> or any of his other Provinces produce; it is his <hi>Indian</hi> Gold that endangers and diſturbs all the Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> it creeps into Councils, purchaſes Intelligence, and ſets bound Loyalty at Liberty in the greateſt Monarchies thereof; if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King can keep us from foreign Enterprizes, and from the Impeachment of his Trades, either by Offer of Invaſion, or by beſieging us in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Ireland,</hi> or elſewhere, he has then brought the Work of our Peril in great Forwardneſs; for thoſe Princes, who abound in Treaſure, have great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over the reſt, if they once conſtrain them to a <hi>defenſive</hi> War, where they are driven, once a Year or oftener, to caſt Lots for their own Garments. <hi>For theſe and other ſubſtantial Reaſons which</hi> Ralegh <hi>produces, he declares, he has laboured all his Life in the Promotion of thoſe Attempts which promis'd either an Enlargement of our own national Intereſt,</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0181500200:194"/>
               <hi>or an Abatement of the encroaching Greatneſs of the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>who, in his Judgment, is not to be more eaſily reduc'd than by</hi> ſuch a War; <hi>from ſo many weak Nations are his Treaſures gather'd, and ſo far ſeparated from mutual Succour. But becauſe he thought ſuch Reſolution and Preparations were not to be hoped for in Haſte, he doubted not, if her Majeſty would embrace the Offer of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and that Empire now by him diſcovered, before they were engroſs'd by the Enemy; but it would yield greater Quantities of Treaſure than all the King of</hi> Spain <hi>poſſeſſes from the</hi> Indies, <hi>both</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt; <hi>and he would be contented to loſe her good Opinion for ever, and his Life withal, if the Country ſhould not be found to exceed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had been promis'd in his Diſcourſe of it. Tho' he has therein written, he doubts not after the firſt or ſecond Year that the ſame ſhould be coloniz'd, but to ſee in</hi> London <hi>a Contractation-houſe of more Receipt for</hi> Guiana, <hi>than that in</hi> Seville <hi>for the</hi> Weſt-Indies. <hi>And is poſitive,</hi> That if there was but a ſmall Army a-foot in <hi>Guiana,</hi> marching towards <hi>Manoa,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Inga,</hi> he would yield to her Majeſty, by Compoſition, ſo many hundred thouſand Pounds yearly, as ſhould both defend us from all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, and defray all Expences at home; and that he would beſides pay a Garriſon of <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4000</hi> Soldiers very royally to defend him againſt other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for he cannot but know how his Predeceſſors were beaten out by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that they have ever ſince, with the greateſt Cruelties, ſought the Entry of his Country, wherefore he would doubtleſs be brought to Tribute; if not, having neither Shot nor Iron weapon in his Empire, he might eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd. <hi>And in another Part of the ſaid Diſcourſe, he has theſe Words,</hi> If it be my Lot to proſecute the ſame, I will willingly ſpend my Life therein; and if
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0181500200:195"/>
any elſe ſhall be enabled thereto, and conquer the ſame, I aſſure him thus much, he ſhall perform more than ever was done in <hi>Mexico</hi> by <hi>Cortez;</hi> or in <hi>Peru</hi> by <hi>Piſarro,</hi> whereof one conquer'd the Empire of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma,</hi> the other of <hi>Guaſcar</hi> and <hi>Atabalipa;</hi> and whatſoever Prince ſhall poſſeſs it, that Prince ſhall be Lord of more Gold, and of more beautiful Empire, and of more Cities and People, than either the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Grand Turk. <hi>Concluding his whole Treatiſe of</hi> Guiana, <hi>with</hi> his Trust in him who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, to put it into her Heart, who is the Lady of Ladies, to poſſeſs it; if not, I will judge thoſe Men worthy to be Kings thereof, <hi>ſays he,</hi> who by her Grace and Leave will undertake it of themſelves.</p>
            <p>All this would not do to raiſe the ſaternine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the State to purſue this Action; and upon this Occaſion we might obſerve, as <hi>Ralegh</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon another from a Poet of his own Time, That <hi>ſome great Men cloathing their private Envy in the fair Colours of the publick Good, curbed the moſt needful and noble Undertakings with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrust, through a ſpecious Care for the Service of the State.</hi> Among theſe ſage and ſceptical Politicians, we may diſcern Sir <hi>Robert Cecyl</hi> to be one, who, in his Conferences with ſome of the ſpeculative Geographers of his Time, would ſhew how careful he was not to be overtaken with any partial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the planting of <hi>Guiana,</hi> as we are told by one of them, whom he would conſult about the Matter: Nevertheleſs, <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Advice was not wholly diſregarded. For that part of it, propoſing to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to a defenſive War, but upon their own proper Coaſts and Harbours, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of; and <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf choſen, with other Commanders, to put it in Execution. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End of <hi>January</hi> following, he fitted out Capt.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0181500200:196"/>
               <hi>Keymis</hi> with a Couple of Ships, the <hi>Darling</hi> and <hi>Diſcoverer;</hi> but provided, rather to continue the Correſpondence and peaceful Traffick with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> than to ſtrengthen them in a warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Forces and Accoutrements, which was what they moſt deſired and expected. When <hi>Keymis</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Guiana,</hi> he found his Friends much diſperſed, but yet enquiring what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> whom they had been prepar'd ſome Months to join; were mighty joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hear he was not ſlain at <hi>Cumana,</hi> as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> now much encreas'd among them, had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted; but ſadly diſappointed that he had not ſent a larger Fleet to expel them, and conquer their neighbouring Enemies up to the Imperial City. <hi>Keymis</hi> further learnt, that <hi>Berreo,</hi> being left at <hi>Cumana,</hi> and lodged in the Houſe of one <hi>Faſhardo;</hi> the Governors of the <hi>Carraccas</hi> and <hi>Margarita,</hi> conſpiring together, had ſent into <hi>Spain</hi> to inform King <hi>Philip,</hi> that <hi>Berreo,</hi> being retired to ſpend the Remainder of his declining Days in Privacy and Eaſe, was utterly unable to purſue the Enterprize; yet of what Importance his Majeſty's Regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to was, ſince ſo eminent an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalier, as Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> had, by a vigorous Progreſs and moſt artful Addreſs, made ſuch Conqueſts and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries in ſome Parts, and render'd himſelf ſo extenſively engaging in all wherever he came, that unleſs they had Power given them to undertake the Charge, all their paſt Endeavours and future Hopes in thoſe Parts would come to nothing. But <hi>Berreo</hi>'s Camp-Maſter having been long before ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> with Gold enough gotten out of <hi>Guiana,</hi> to levy and furniſh 500 Men, ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſollicited <hi>Berreo</hi>'s Cauſe, that preſent Order was given for the victualling and manning of ten Ships to be ſent to him; ſo well worth his Care
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0181500200:197"/>
did the King of <hi>Spain</hi> think this Undertaking. And further, this Gold bore ſuch Weight, that the King commanded eighteen Ships more to ſtop at <hi>Trinidad,</hi> and not follow their other Directions, before they ſaw that Place ſecur'd from Enemies. But <hi>Berreo</hi> himſelf ſuſpecting that ſpeedy Diſpatch, return'd to <hi>Carapana</hi>'s Port with fifteen Men, the ſcatter'd Remant that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had left him. Thoſe Governors follow'd him, and anticipating the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they promis'd themſelves from <hi>Spain,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd <hi>Guiana</hi> with their Men, and determin'd to murder <hi>Berreo,</hi> who fled towards <hi>Caroli,</hi> expecting his Son <hi>Antonio de Ximenes</hi> with Succours from the new Kingdom of <hi>Granada.</hi> And now <hi>Topiowary,</hi> who had fled to the Mountains, being dead, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boy, <hi>Ralegh</hi> left, was devour'd by a Tyger, <hi>Sanjago,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in the Faction of the Governors aforeſaid, took <hi>Francis Sparrow</hi> Priſoner, who was alſo left by <hi>Ralegh;</hi> but having gather'd great Plenty of Gold, he ranſom'd his Life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, yet was kept in Captivity by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſome Years, as we may hereafter learn. After this, the Faction return'd to <hi>Trinidad,</hi> and begun to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build their Town, where, unhappily to theſe new lawleſs Rulers, the twenty-eight Sail of Ships ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>February</hi> following, and took <hi>Sanjago</hi> Priſoner, whom <hi>Keymis</hi> found in Chains, expecting to be put to Death. The other Actors in this Interlude vaniſhing in Canoes, recover'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita</hi> and <hi>Cumana</hi> again. When eighteen of thoſe Ships had left all things in good Order, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted according to their Inſtructions, leaving the other ten to ſortify at <hi>Conquerabia,</hi> for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Fleet. Nor was it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four Months after the Arrival of thoſe Ships from <hi>Spain,</hi> that the King had prepared ſeveral others, it being in <hi>June</hi> 1596, to tranſport a new

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When</hi> Keymis <hi>was advanced to</hi> Topiowary<hi>'s Port, he found the</hi> Spaniards <hi>under</hi> Berreo <hi>had planted a Village there, and that a rocky Iſland againſt the Mouth of</hi> Caroli <hi>was their Fort or Refuge; but now leaving both Town and Iſland, they gathered at the Mouth of that River, and had ſent for Cannon to defend the Paſſage</hi> to thoſe Mines, ſays <hi>Keymis</hi> to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> from whence your Ore and white Stones were taken the laſt Year: <hi>adding,</hi> We all, not without Grief, to ſee ourſelves thus defeated, and our hungry Hopes made void, were witneſſes of this their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. <hi>Then</hi> Keymis <hi>reſolved to ſeek out</hi> Putijma, <hi>who, with ſome Friends, was retired to the high Lands, not far from the Mountain</hi> Aio, <hi>intending, if the</hi> Indians <hi>ſhould think themſelves too weak with his Help to diſplant the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>to ſet ſome of them to work, for Hatchets and Knives, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him Grains of Gold and white Stones from ſuch Places as they ſhould be directed to. But when he came to the Place of their Abode, they were fled, apprehending him and his Company perhaps to have been a Party of</hi> Spaniards. Here, as <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> goes on, <hi>Gilbert</hi> my Pilot offered to bring us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Mine of white Stones near <hi>Winicapora,</hi> or elſe to a gold Mine which <hi>Putiima</hi> had ſhewed him, being but one Day's Journey over-land from the Place where we now ſtaid at Anchor. I ſaw far off the Mountains adjoining to this gold Mine; and, having meaſured their Paths near the ſame Place this laſt Year, could not judge it to be <hi>15</hi> Miles from us. I do well remember, how coming that Way with <hi>Putiima</hi> the Year before, he pointed to this ſame Mountain, making Signs to have me go with him thither. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his Signs, and marked the Place, but miſtook his Meaning, imagining that he would have ſhewed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0181500200:199"/>
me the Over-fall of the River <hi>Curwari</hi> from the Mountains. My <hi>Indian</hi> ſhewed me in what Sort, without digging, they gather the Gold in the Sand of a ſmall River named <hi>Macawini,</hi> which ſprings and falls from the Rocks where this Mine is. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told me, that he was with <hi>Putiima</hi> when <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quito</hi> was to be executed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that then the chief of <hi>Morequito</hi>'s Friends were in Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſhew this Mine unto them, if it might redeem their Captain's Life; but upon better Advice, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them in this Caſe to be implacable, and that this might prove a Means to loſe not only their King, but their Country, they have to this Day concealed it from them, being of all others the richeſt and moſt plentiful. <hi>And a little further, among the Reaſons he gives for his not bringing Proofs away from this Mountain of his having known the Contents of it, this is one,</hi> Forethinking withal that there being no means but ourſelves to make known our Diſcovery, if we returned not; in our Misfortune, the Hope of following this Voyage would be buried. <hi>And further ſtill, he ſays,</hi> I could promiſe Hope of gold Mines, and certain Aſſurances of Pieces of made Gold; of Spleen ſtones, Kidney-ſtones, and others of better Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: But becauſe our Belief ſeems to be matted in theſe greater Matters, and a Certainty of ſmaller Profits is the readieſt Inducement to quicken our weak Hopes, I go not ſo far, ſays he, as my own Eyes might warrant me. <hi>Theſe Teſtimonies, and others which may be produced</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>When</hi> Keymis <hi>was arrived at the Port of</hi> Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pana, <hi>this Caſique ſent ſome of his People in</hi> Canoes <hi>to aſſure him he would come down next Day and have a Conference with him; but not coming in five or ſix Days, he at laſt ſent one of his aged Attendants to excuſe the Fatigue of ſuch a Journey, ſo unfavourable were the Ways, and himſelf ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with Years and Infirmities. This old Envoy then enlarged upon the Inconveniencies they felt in uſing the</hi> Spaniards <hi>Aſſiſtance againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, eſpecially when he compared their Conduct with that of the Queen of</hi> England<hi>'s Subjects under her great Commander:</hi> For, ſaid he, the laſt Year, we doubted not but that he, being able, would have perſecuted us as the Supporters of your Adverſaries; would have taken our Towns, and have made us ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome our Wives and Children: But we found it far otherwiſe; and that none of your well-governed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany durſt offer us any Wrong; no, not when undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered they might have done it. We then believed to be true, what your grand Captain reported of his Princeſs; took this for a good Proof of her royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Wiſdom, that had framed her Subjects to ſuch Obedience; and of your Happineſs, who enjoyed the Benefit thereof: Wherefore <hi>Carapana,</hi> weighing the friendly Courſe of theſe Proceedings, doth humbly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rave of her Majeſty, for himſelf and his People, that with the Reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who wholly depend on her princely Regard, he alſo may enjoy her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0181500200:201"/>
Protection; not as a Man forſaken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but one that, knowing their Injuſtice, hates their Cruelties, and takes it for the beſt Courſe utterly to diſclaim their Friendſhip. <hi>Here</hi> Keymis <hi>breaks off, to conſider it as a Matter worthy of Obſervation, how this Precedent of</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and good Order, which, among them, his Countrymen, who knew him, was but his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Comportment, or ordinary Practice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſmall Regard with them, had yet both ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated the</hi> Indians <hi>Hearts altogether from the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, <hi>and ſtirred up in them true Love and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration thereof. After this, he diſcloſes his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knowledge of the</hi> Indian <hi>Wealth aforeſaid in theſe Words:</hi> This old Man ſhewed whence moſt of their Gold cometh, which is formed in ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions; whence their Spleen-ſtones, and others of all Sorts, are to be had in Plenty; where Gold is to be gathered in the Sands of their Rivers; from what Part the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> both by Trade and otherwiſe, have returned much Gold; <hi>and doubts not but all this was divulged with the Conſent of</hi> Carapana, <hi>as an Invitation to the further Aid and Protection he expected from the</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Accordingly <hi>Keymis,</hi> finding it was in vain to hope for a Conference with that well-wiſhing, but wary <hi>Caſique,</hi> and, having ſent him a Preſent of Iron, gave Aſſurance to all the <hi>Indians</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to him of his ſpeedy Return with Succours; promiſing to make them all rich in Hatchets, Knives <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe Inſtruments were ſuch preferable Commodities among ſome of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> that <hi>Francis Sparrow,</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Guiana</hi> before-mentioned, tells us he bought at <hi>Camalaha,</hi> to the South of the <hi>Orenoque,</hi> eight young Women, the eldeſt whereof was not 18 Years of Age, for one red-hafted Knife, which in <hi>England</hi> coſt him one Halfpenny.</note>, and Beads, if they would only reſerve
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0181500200:202"/>
good Store of their <hi>Caſſavi</hi> (which they uſed for Bread) and ſome Plates of Gold, for Exchange. And having further ſpent ſome Time in the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of above 50 ſeveral Rivers, Tribes or Nations of People, Towns and Caſiques in this Voyage, he directed his Courſe homewards, and arrived at <hi>Portland</hi> in the latter End of <hi>June</hi> aforeſaid; having ſpent five Months in going, ſtaying, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As ſoon as he got Home, he found <hi>Ralegh</hi> had been gone upon a grand Expedition out of the Nation near a Month. Therefore he had Time to draw up his Account of this Voyage (whence the Paſſages which more immediately relate to our Subject are extracted) ready to preſent him with at his Return into <hi>England;</hi> which he did, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it <hi>To the approved, right valorous, and worthy Knight Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>Lord-warden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Keymis</hi> return'd into <hi>England, Ralegh</hi> was gone upon that Enterprize which proved the moſt renowned of any the <hi>Engliſh</hi> undertook in thoſe Days againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For the Queen having heard they had received Encouragement from <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebel, to threaten her with a new Invaſion; that becauſe ſhe had ſtrengthened their Enemies, they would take the ſhorteſt Courſe, and begin with <hi>England.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had made great Naval Preparations, to which they might not be a little embolden'd both by the Death of her two brave old Commanders, <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Hawkins;</hi> and again by their late Succeſs, no further from her own Coaſts than <hi>Calais;</hi> which taking by Storm, under Cardinal <hi>Albert,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and Governor of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Thunder of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Artillery alarmed her Majeſty's Ears in her Palace at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> This Poſture of Affairs made the Queen determine, to uſe the moſt effectual Means for preventing the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0181500200:203"/>
Miſchiefs of an Aſſault, by taking the Start of them, and ſending a Force ſufficient to deſtroy the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Shipping in their own Harbours. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly a powerful Fleet was fitted out to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 150 Sail, according to <hi>Camden</hi> from <hi>Stow,</hi> and <hi>Speed</hi> from both. But in the old Manuſcript Liſt of this Fleet, which <hi>Camden</hi> followed as to the Number of Men, it appears there were no more than 96 Ships of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy, which were afterwards join'd by 24 Sail of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Grotius</hi> and their other Hiſtorians. This <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet contain'd about 14000 Men, were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 100 were Voluntiers. Now if to this Number of Men, we add alſo that in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, which according to their own Computation was near 2600 Men, there might be enough to leave the whole Fleet furniſh'd with ſufficient Hands to guard and work it, and allow of 10360 Men to land upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt.</p>
            <p>The Lord Admiral <hi>Howard</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> were joined in Commiſſion Generals of this Enterprize; but the Queen conſidering what there might be wanting to keep an old Head and a young one, a cool and a warm one in due Temper and Harmony, allotted them a Council of War in theſe Words. <hi>For the better and more orderly Execution of this your Commiſſion, and of thoſe former Articles compriſed in theſe our Inſtructions, we do ordain, that there ſhall be two Perſons ſerving for the Seas, and two that are appointed to ſerve for Land Service, to be as Counſellors to you in our Name, that is, the Lord</hi> Thomas Howard, <hi>and Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh; <hi>Sir</hi> Francis Vere <hi>and Sir</hi> Coniers Clifford; <hi>and to theſe four, we do add Sir</hi> George Carew, <hi>Lieutenant of our Ordnance, to make the Number of five; whom alſo we charge by theſe Preſents, that they will, as they will anſwer before God, give their Councils to</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0181500200:204"/>
               <hi>you both, without any private Reſpect to either of you, for Love or Fear, in all Actions to be put in Queſtion or taken in hand; and the ſame deliberately to debate, as the Weight of the Matter ſhall require, before any Reſolution be made, and before the putting of the Matter in Action.</hi> There is further to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by thoſe <hi>two Perſons ſerving for the Seas,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> were alſo conſtituted Admirals in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Hence was the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet divided into four Squadrons, and ſo it appears in the Liſt aforeſaid, wherein we find that which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Ralegh</hi> conſiſted of 22 Ships, 1352 Mariners, and 1875 Soldiers. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron was commanded by the Admiral of <hi>Holland,</hi> named <hi>John Duvenvord,</hi> Lord of <hi>Warmondt.</hi> How <hi>Eſſex</hi> reliſh'd the Diviſion of Authority, may be ſomewhat gueſs'd at by the Queen's Anſwer to one of his Letters it ſeems, which ſhe thought very ſtrange. <hi>You mention, ſays ſhe, firſt a Danger to commit Authority to any other, becauſe you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to your Commiſſion and Inſtructions formerly ſent you, which hath no Power of Deputation; as who ſhould ſay, that if you did follow the Directions of our</hi> Hand, <hi>our great</hi> Seal <hi>in this Matter ſhould be brought to diſpute the Validity of your Warrant.</hi> A little further it appears, that he had been impatient to be gone for fear he ſhould be detain'd, for the Queen had perſuaded him to ſtay behind; but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, ſhe at length told him, <hi>Though we meant to drive it to the laſt Conſiderations and utmoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates as much as could be, yet we compared Times ſo ſufficiently, as a Prince who knows what belongs to ſuch a Matter, that nothing ſhould be done to retard you (being ready) one Hour: For as we know</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>not to be arriv'd, ſo we know after it, ſome Time to embark ſuch an Army muſt be required.</hi> But
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0181500200:205"/>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi> joined the Fleet, and the whole Army was embark'd within ten Days after the Writing of this Letter, for on the 1ſt of <hi>June</hi> before mentioned the Fleet ſet Sail from <hi>Plymouth.</hi> When they came to the North Cape of <hi>Spain,</hi> they called a ſelect Council, by hanging out the Flag of Arms; and then had the Maſter and Captain of every Ship his ſealed Inſtructions given him, or Letters of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, which were not to be open'd till they were paſt <hi>Cape St. Vincent,</hi> unleſs ſeparated by bad Weather; but to be thrown overboard in Caſe of Danger from the Enemy; and by which it appear'd the Voyage was determin'd for <hi>Cadiz.</hi> They had a fortunate Progreſs, both as to the Wind, and the taking of every Ship, which could give the Enemy Intelligence of their Approach. On the 20th of <hi>June</hi> the Fleet came to Anchor in the Bay of St. <hi>Sebaſtians,</hi> ſhort of <hi>Cadiz</hi> half a League. The Lord-Admiral, being careful of her Majeſty Ships, had reſolved, with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that the Town ſhould be firſt attempted, to the End that both the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleons and Galleys, together with the Forts of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> might not all at once beat upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy. <hi>Ralegh</hi> was not preſent at this Reſolution, as himſelf has declar'd in that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Action, which he diſpatched ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was over to a Miniſter of State in <hi>England;</hi> which being the cleareſt I have met with, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt to be confirmed, not only by the more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Pens of Foreigners, but the moſt partial ones of our own Country, thoſe of his Competitors themſelves for Honour in this Engagement, will here be our beſt Guide. Hence therefore we learn the Reaſon of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Aoſence at that Reſolution of firſt landing the Army to have been, becauſe he was engaged the Day before outward on the Seas in ſtopping ſuch <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships as might paſs out from
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0181500200:206"/>
               <hi>St. Lucar</hi> or <hi>Cadiz</hi> along the Coaſt. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, two Hours after the reſt, he found the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> diſembarking his Soldiers, having put many Companies into Boats, with Intention to make his Deſcent on the weſt-Side of <hi>Cadiz;</hi> but the Bilbows were ſo raging, that the Boats were ready to ſink at the Stern of the Earl, and divers were loſt with ſome armed Soldiers in them; but becauſe this Courſe had been reſolved on, and that doubting, now in the Danger, might look like dreading of it, the Earl continued his Purpoſe of landing; when <hi>Ralegh</hi> came aboard his Ship, and, in the Preſence of all the Colonels, proteſted againſt the Reſolution; giving him many Reaſons and apparent Demonſtrations, that, to the utter Overthrow of their Armies, themſelves, and her Majeſty's future Safety, he was running the Way of a general Ruin. The Earl excuſed himſelf, and laid it upon the Lord-Admiral, who would not conſent, he ſaid, to enter with the Fleet till the Town was firſt poſſeſſed. All the Commanders and Gentlemen preſent beſought <hi>Ralegh</hi> to diſſuade the Attempt, for they all perceived the Danger, and were convinced that the greateſt Part muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ere they could ſet Foot on Ground; and if any reached the Shore, yet would they ſurely have their Boats caſt on their Heads; and 20 Men, in ſuch a deſperate Deſcent, might defeat them all. The Earl hereupon prayed <hi>Ralegh</hi> to go and perſwade the Lord Admiral, who being alſo by him made ſenſible, that certain Deſtruction would be the Conſequence of purſuing the former Reſolution, conſented to enter the Port. When <hi>Ralegh</hi> brought <hi>Eſſex</hi> the News of this Agreement, and call'd out of his Boat <hi>Entramos, Entramos,</hi> as he return'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, the Earl threw his Hat into the Sea for Joy, and prepared to weigh Anchor. The Day
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0181500200:207"/>
was now far ſpent, and it required much Time to return the Boats of Soldiers to their own Ships. So as that Night they could not attempt the Fleet, <hi>Altho' many, ſeeming deſperately valiant, thought it a Fault of mine, ſays</hi> Ralegh, <hi>to delay it till Morning, though we had neither agreed in what Manner to fight, nor appointed who ſhould lead, and who ſecond; whether by boarding or otherwiſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could our Fleet poſſibly recover all their Men in before Sun-ſet. But both the Generals being pleaſed to hear me, and many Times to be adviſed by ſo mean an Underſtanding, came again to Anchor, and in the very Mouth of the Harbour. So that Night, about</hi> 10 <hi>o'Clock, I wrote a Letter to the Lord Admiral, declaring therein my Opinion,</hi> how the Fight ſhould be order'd; <hi>perſuading him to appoint to each of the great Galleons of</hi> Spain, <hi>two great Fly-hoats to board them, after the Queen's Ships had batter'd them; for I knew that both St.</hi> Philip <hi>and the Reſt would burn, and not yield; and then to loſe ſo many of the Queen's Ships for Company, I thought too dear a Purchaſe, and what would be termed but a</hi> lamentable Victory.</p>
            <p>This Method being agreed on, and both the Generals perſuaded to lead the Body of the Fleet, the Charge of the Van, for putting it in Execution, was, upon <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Requeſt, granted and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him. The Ship himſelf was in, called the <hi>Warſpite,</hi> was one of the Queen's, and carried about 290 Mariners. The Reſt, appointed out of her Navy to ſecond him, were, the <hi>Mary-Roſe,</hi> commanded by Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> the <hi>Lion</hi> by Sir <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi> the <hi>Rainbow</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> the <hi>Swiftſure</hi> by Capt. <hi>Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Dreadnought</hi> by Sir <hi>Coniers</hi> and <hi>Alex. Clifford,</hi> the <hi>Nonpareil</hi> by Mr. <hi>Robert Dudley;</hi> beſides 12 <hi>Londoners</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fly-Boats. Thus the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Mer Honeur,</hi> which he commanded,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0181500200:208"/>
was one of the greateſt Ships, was alſo left behind with the Generals; but being impatient thereof, he preſſed them to have the Service committed to him, and to that End exchanged his Ship with Mr. <hi>Dudley.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Ralegh</hi> obſerves, <hi>For my own Part, as I was willing to give Honour to my Lord</hi> Thomas, <hi>having both Precedency in the Army, and being a Nobleman whom I much honoured; ſo I was yet reſolved to give, and not to take Example for this Service, holding my own Reputation deareſt.</hi> Therefore with the firſt Peep of Day he weighed Anchor, taking the Start of all others a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and bear with the Enemy, who was in the following Diſpoſition to receive him.</p>
            <p>Under the Walls of <hi>Cadiz</hi> were ranged 17 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, which lay with their Prows to flank his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. There was alſo a Fort called <hi>Philip,</hi> which beat into and commanded the Harbour, beſides the Ordnance, which lay all along the Curtain upon the Wall towards the Sea, and divers other Pieces of Culverin which ſcoured the Channel. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as ſoon as the Enemy perceived an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Admiral under Sail approaching, ſeveral of their Galleons and other Ships of War, with 40 great Veſſels beſides bound for <hi>Mexico</hi> and other Parts, alſo ſet ſail. Of all which, the <hi>St. Philip, Matthew, Andrew</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> being four of the capital Galleons of <hi>Spain,</hi> came again to anchor under the Fort of <hi>Puntal,</hi> in a Streight of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which leads over to <hi>Puerto Real.</hi> On the ſtarboard Side of them, they placed three Frigats of War; at their Back, two great Galleons of <hi>Liſbon,</hi> beſides two well furniſhed Argoſies; and the 17 Gallies by three and three, were to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace them as Occaſion ſhould be offered. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, Vice-admiral, and Rear-Admiral of <hi>New Spain,</hi> with the Body of the Fleet, were ranged
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0181500200:209"/>

Accordingly the Ships that followed beat upon the Galleys ſo thick, that they ſoon betook them to their Oars, and got up to join with the Galleons in the Streight, as aforeſaid; then as they were driven to paſs near him, he beſtow'd his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from ſeveral Broadſides among them; but ply'd St. <hi>Philip,</hi> the great and famous Admiral of <hi>Spain,</hi> moſt conſtantly, as being moſt worthy of his Fire; and being now reſolved to repay the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's former Treatment of the <hi>Revenge,</hi> or to ſecond her Loſs with his own Life, he came to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor

by the great Galleons, whereof the <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Andrew</hi> were the two which boarded that brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship. Here he fell to battering of them very briſkly, expecting after awhile the Fly-Boats to come up, that he might board and take them. And now began the Engagement to be very deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> came to anchor on one ſide of him, though pretty much behind, with Sir <hi>Robert Southwell;</hi> Sir <hi>George Carew</hi> and the <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> on the other, and Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſide of <hi>Puntal.</hi> At laſt the Thunder of the Ordnance grew ſo great about Ten a-Clock in the Morning, that <hi>Eſſex,</hi> impatient to abide far off, thruſt up through the Fleet, heading all thoſe on the left Hand, and on that ſide anchor'd next to <hi>Ralegh;</hi> afterwards came in Captain <hi>Croſs</hi> as near as he could; but <hi>Ralegh,</hi> to his great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, held always ſingle in the head of all. Now after they had beat, as at two Buts, one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other almoſt three Hours; ſo that the Volleys of Cannon and Culverin came as thick as if it had been a Skirmiſh of Muſketeers, till <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship was in Danger of ſinking in the Place, he made away to <hi>Eſſex</hi> in his Skiff, to deſire that he would inforce the promiſed Fly-Boats to come up, that he might board; for as he rid, he could not long endure ſo great a Battery.</p>
            <p>Eſſex <hi>was then coming up himſelf; to whom</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>declared,</hi> That if the Flyboats came not, he would board in the Queen's Ship; for it was the ſame Loſs to burn or ſink, and one he muſt endure. <hi>Then the Earl promiſed him,</hi> That whatever he attempted, he would ſecond him in Perſon upon Honour. <hi>In the mean while, the Lord Admiral</hi> Howard, <hi>being alſo at firſt diſpoſed to advance, but the River was ſo choaked that he could not paſs in the</hi> Ark, <hi>came with the Lord</hi> Thomas <hi>in the</hi> Nonpareil; <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0181500200:211"/>
               <hi>while</hi> Ralegh <hi>was ſpeaking to</hi> Eſſex, the Marſhal <hi>(Vere)</hi> who thought it ſome Touch, ſays <hi>Ralegh,</hi> to his great eſteemed Valour, to ride behind me ſo many Hours, got up a-head of my Ship; which Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> perceiving, headed him again, myſelf being but a Quarter of an Hour abſent. At my return, finding myſelf from being the firſt to be but the third, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently let ſlip Anchor, and thruſting in between the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> and the Marſhal, went further a-head than all of them before, and thruſt myſelf athwart the Channel, ſo as I was ſure none ſhould outſtart me again for that Day. Eſſex <hi>thinking his Ship ſtronger than the reſt, thruſt</hi> Clifford<hi>'s aſide, and ſtill got next to</hi> Ralegh, <hi>on the left Hand, a-head of all that Rank, but Lord</hi> Thomas; <hi>while</hi> Vere <hi>ſecretly faſtned a Rope on</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Ship-ſide towards him, and drew himſelf up equal with him; but ſome of his Company advertiſing him thereof, he cauſed it to be cut aſunder, ſo</hi> Vere <hi>fell back into his Place, whom</hi> Ralegh <hi>guarded all but his Prow from the Sight of the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now <hi>Ralegh</hi> having no Hopes of his Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats, and <hi>Eſſex</hi> with the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> having promiſed to ſecond him, he laid out a Warp by the Side of the <hi>Philip</hi> to cloſe, the Wind hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him otherwiſe to board her; and when the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral thereof, with the Commanders of the other three wooden Apoſtles, found that <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> began to do the like, they all ſlipped Anchor, and ran aground; Heaps of Soldiers and Mariners tumbling into the Sea like Coals out of a Sack, ſays <hi>Ralegh,</hi> into many Ports at once; ſome drowning, ſome ſticking in the Mud. He alſo tells us, the <hi>Philip</hi> thereupon burnt herſelf; and another Author more particularly in theſe Words: <hi>As</hi> Ralegh <hi>thought to have boarded the great Galleon</hi> St. Philip, <hi>a Negro gave fire to the Powder, and</hi>

               <hi>eſcaped by ſwimming; it gave ſo great a Crack, that the Maſt was blown up into the Air, as if it had been an Arrow. A Pinnace that lay near it was burnt, but the Men eſcaped in Boats. The other Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, called</hi> St. Thomas, <hi>was likewiſe blown up, but did no Harm to the</hi> Englſh. He alſo mentions <hi>two Eaſterlings which ran aſhore, and were burnt; but, ſays he, the</hi> St. Matthew <hi>and</hi> St. Andrew, <hi>of</hi> 10 <hi>or</hi> 1200 <hi>Ton a-piece, were ſaved from running aground, and carried away.</hi> However, he does not inform us particularly by whom; and others ſeem to have done <hi>Ralegh</hi> more wrong, in nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating other Perſons, and omitting him in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; ſince it appears under his own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, that he took them both himſelf. And this agrees with the Manner his Letter of this Action in Print has expreſſed it, where he ſays, <hi>thoſe Galleons were recovered with our Boats e'er they could get out to fire them.</hi> Here he obſerves upon the Enemies running to the Shores, and thus firing their Ships, that the Spectacle was very lamentable on their Side; for many drowned themſelves; many half burnt, leaped into the Water; very many, hanging at the Ropes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ends by the Ship's Side under the Water, even to the Lips; many ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with grievous Wounds, 'till ſtruck under Water, and put out of their Pain; and withal ſuch huge Fires, and ſuch tearing of the Ordnance, in the <hi>Great Philip</hi> and the reſt, when the Flames came to them, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> thought there was here to be ſeen the moſt lively Figure of Hell itſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus the Victory was obtained by Sea, and the Bay reſigned by two, ſome ſay, by four o'Clock in the Afternoon; though no more of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were conſtantly and cloſely engaged, than the Ships and Commanders before-mentioned, againſt the ſix great Galleons, 17 Gallies, with the Fleet of <hi>New</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0181500200:214"/>
a ſudden Fury, in a ſhort Space of Time, and with very little Loſs. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> though he had received a grievous Wound in his Leg, being much torn and deformed with a Splinter-ſhot in the Fight; yet, willing to encourage the Army with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and deſirous of ſeeing the Actions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Enemy, he was carried aſhore on the Shoulders of his Men, where the Lord-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, out of his Care and Regard, ſent him one of his Horſes; but his own being recovered in due Time, was made ready for him.</p>
            <p>The Torment he endur'd, and the Fear he was continually in of being ſhoulder'd by the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Soldiers, abandon'd to Spoil and Rapine, without any Reſpect of Perſons, made him unable to abide above an Hour in the Town. <note n="*" place="bottom">After the Surrender was over, Order was given to tranſport the religious Men and Women, Merchant's Wives, &amp;c. to <hi>Port St. Mary,</hi> that no Violence might be offer'd them.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0181500200:215"/>
we have it under his own Hand, they defrauded him. He had deſired the Conſent of the Generals, that he might go and ſecure or deſtroy the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, which was ſaid to be worth twelve Millions, and lay in <hi>Puerto-Real</hi> Road; but they deſired to conſider on it till next Morning.

In the Afternoon of the ſame Day, the Merchants of <hi>Cadiz</hi> and <hi>Seville</hi> offer'd the Generals, by the Committee of the Contractation-Houſe, with the Purveyor, Corrigidor, and other Officers, two Millions of <hi>Ducats</hi> to ſpare that Fleet; neither could this bring them to any Reſolution, ſo that Advantage was loſt. <hi>Ralegh</hi> might poſſibly inſiſt upon a larger Compoſition, by ſaying, <hi>They ought firſt to be Maſters of the Fleet, and ranſom it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for if they offer'd two Millions already, they would give four when it was taken.</hi> But it appears plain enough, that <hi>Eſſex</hi> was not for having the Fleet ſeiz'd upon, unleſs by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Conway,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gerrard,</hi> and other Land Officers, which <hi>Ralegh</hi> would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to for the Honour of the Sailors; as it does appear from <hi>Cambden,</hi> that the Lord-Admiral would not conſent to any Compoſition. <hi>For we came,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to conſume them, and not compound with them.</hi> But they ſaved him the Trouble; for the next Morning, being the 23d of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> cauſed all that Fleet of Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be ſet on Fire, becauſe he was convinced, from their being beſet ſo vigilantly by <hi>Ralegh,</hi>

Thus both Galleons, Frigats, Argoſies, with the Fleet of <hi>Nueva Eſpana,</hi> and all except the Gallies, which it ſeems eſcaped, were conſumed to Aſhes.

the Wind being unfavourable, they thought it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to enter; therefore, and becauſe the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als daily grew more ſcarce, ſo that in ſome Ships there was already extreme Want, ſays Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> it was reſolved to make Homewards: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Sir <hi>William Monſon,</hi> in Favour of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to go upon freſh Exploits, computes they had enough Proviſion to ſupply them ſeven Weeks. <hi>Monſon</hi> alſo imputes the general Declenſion of the Officers from any further Invaſion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at this Time, to the Covetouſneſs of thoſe who wanted to ſecure the Treaſures they had amaſſed. And indeed <hi>Vere</hi> diſcovers not any Concurrence now with <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s new Schemes of Adventure, as might have been expected towards a Patron who had ſhewn him ſo much Favour and Countenance; but viſibly haſtens Home upon the Complaint of the Scarcity aforeſaid. And yet that which might be thought <hi>Vere</hi>'s true Motive for returning, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imputed to the Lord-admiral nor Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> tho', both by Speech and Writing, they argued for it as much as any; for they had engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no Booty that might be endangered by entering upon further Engagements abroad. Yet had they other Objections to theſe inconſiderate Projects, than the Want of Victuals or Sickneſs of Men; for after both theſe Inconveniencies in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship were propoſed to be redreſs'd by <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as <hi>Monſon</hi> tells us, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was as reſolute againſt hazarding the Honour, as others the Riches that was got at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz;</hi> and in this entirely agreed with the Lord-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, who perſuaded them to conſider how ſubject they might be to great Loſſes in little Enterprizes, which would not add much to their Praiſe, if they ſucceeded; but ſurely would to their Diſcredit if they failed. This being the Senſe of the greater or
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0181500200:221"/>
the wiſer Part, moſt of the Fleet returned with the Lord-admiral to <hi>Plymouth</hi> on the 8th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and the Reſt, with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> two Days after; who thence took his Journey to Court, as <hi>Ralegh</hi> probably did at the ſame Time. On the 13th of the ſame Month, we find by a Letter from the Council of State to the Lord-admiral, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with the Fleet to the <hi>Downs,</hi> that <hi>Ralegh</hi> as well as <hi>Eſſex</hi> had been with them, and probably with the Queen; from whom we hear of no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Conduct in the whole Action: Therefore probably he was among thoſe principal Actors therein, whom ſhe diſtinguiſhed with liberal Praiſes and Rewards. Yet that Letter does diſcover her Majeſty's Diſſatisfaction towards the Lord-admiral, that he did not lie in wait for the Carracks, or the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Fleet, as <hi>Eſſex</hi> had intreated him to do. And whereas Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> ſays, that when <hi>Eſſex</hi> landed in the Weſt, and left Orders with him for diſſolving not only the Land-forces, but the Shipping, there aroſe much Strife between the ſaid Mariners and his <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> Troops at their Parting, the Sailors being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſhare in the Cheſts and Packs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Soldiers had moſt unproportionably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched themſelves in the late Spoil; at which <hi>Vere</hi> complained to the Lord-admiral for Redreſs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that <hi>ſome other principal Officers of the Fleet</hi> took the Sailors Part; and, as if they thought them unreaſonably dealt with, who had made Way by the Sea-fight, for the Soldiers to get thoſe Riches by Land, asked him, <hi>whether the Mariners ſhould have nothing?</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>their Hopes in the</hi> Indian <hi>Fleet were more to be deſired than that Troſh (as he calls it) which the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men had got in the Town; ſo as they had none to blame but their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi>

               <hi>and their bad Fortune: Which Anſwer,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was taken to Heart, and is not forgotten to this Hour, of which I feel the Smart:</hi> If <hi>Ralegh</hi> was one of thoſe principal Officers here pointed at, who thus ſtood the Sailors Advocate, as he might be, notwithſtanding his expeditious Progreſs to Court, the indifferent Manner wherewith <hi>Vere</hi> has treated him is very accountable to me. But <hi>Vere</hi> has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betrayed his Partiality, in not telling us the Conſequence of his ſaid Application to the Lord-Admiral, which appears in that Letter and others, from the Council aforeſaid, to have procured the Diſpoſal of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plunder towards the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy; and that <hi>Vere</hi>'s <hi>Low-Country</hi> Regiments ſhould not return before they were ſearched both in Ships and Perſon. As for <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he wrote a <hi>Cenſure of the Omiſſions</hi> in this Voyage, which he imputes to the Diſſenſions of his Council and Colleague. Whence the common Hiſtorians have been led indiſcriminately to arraign the ſetting forth ſuch Expeditions under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of equal Authority, and have ſo much neglected giving theſe their diſtinct Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for what they did, as to cavil at them for what they left undone; while others more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve, <hi>That never was ſo much Riches and Renown acquired with the like naval Succeſs;</hi> well juſtifying the Honours which were paid to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> both by the Authors who dedicated Books to him this Year, the Painters and Sculptors, who have appropriated this Sea-fight to his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits; and thoſe other Advancers of the like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Arts, who, in their Diſcourſes of <hi>Medals</hi> and <hi>Intagias,</hi> have thought him worthy, for this, among his many other Actions and Excellencies, of that metallic Commemoration, which is more

they got out of <hi>Weymouth.</hi> In the Beginning of <hi>March</hi> they diſcover'd the Coaſt, and fell into the River <hi>Wiapouco,</hi> a River almoſt in four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees North of the Line, and about ſixteen Leagues in Length; but not being able to find the Head of its Falls, nor meeting with any of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to ſupply them with Proviſions, they return'd, and made towards the great Town called <hi>Aramatto,</hi> where they ſtored themſelves to their Deſire, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, ſeveral of thoſe Natives came in Canoes, and traded with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their Ships. Then Captain <hi>Berrie</hi> hired ſome of them, with a Preſent of Knives, to go back unto the River <hi>Cawo,</hi> and invite the Ruler of that Place, named <hi>Ritimo,</hi> on board, who accordingly came to them in the River <hi>Chiana,</hi> where he and his Train were feaſted, and traffick'd with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> much to their Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And thither alſo flock'd, from their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towns, great Numbers of a civiliz'd Race of <hi>Carribes,</hi> who brought great Plenty of Victuals and Tobacco, which they exchanged for ſuch Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were well inſtructed to carry thither. After they had declar'd their unanimous Deſire to have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> come and rout the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> take Command of the <hi>Orenoque,</hi> and dwell in the bordering Nations, they departed; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made away to the <hi>Careres,</hi> or Triangular Iſlands, and kept trading on with the People of the neighbouring Towns, who familiarly reſorted to them. Then they paſſed along through the River <hi>Marawin,</hi> to <hi>Quiparia</hi> and <hi>Macirra,</hi> for about 40 or 50 Leagues upward to the Falls of that River, and to the Sight of a rich Country above, where the People were of an extraordinary Stature, and carried Bows hafted with Gold; but were forced to return without compleating that Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, for Want of Proviſion; though my Author,

one of the Adventurers, thought the Palmito's, and other Trees in the Woods, would have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them till they could have rewarded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with what <hi>might have done us good,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as long as we had lived.</hi> On the 15th of <hi>April</hi> 1597, they returned from that River, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered through ſeveral others; till, about four Days after, they fell into the <hi>Coritine.</hi> In this River they met a Bark, called, the <hi>John</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>Leigh</hi> (the ſame, I ſuppoſe, who afterwards made other Voyages to <hi>Guiana;</hi> and took further Poſſeſſion of the Country, not by Force, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Title, but Conſent of the People; tho' for a Prince indeed, who deſerved no Right there which he had not the Spirit to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.) And falling down ſome five Leagues from the Mouth thereof, upon Intelligence that the <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſekebe,</hi> with which that River meets, would lead them within a Day's Journey of the Lake <hi>Perima,</hi> whereon <hi>Manoa</hi> was ſuppſed to ſtand, they meant to diſcover a Paſſage to this rich City.

So, clearing themſelves of this Coaſt, they took their Courſe to the Iſlands of the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Here my Author, who was a Gentleman of the Company, after having ſpoke in Praiſe of the Climate, how

               <note n="*" place="bottom">That there are many rich Mines and Minerals in <hi>Guiana,</hi> as well as Mountains and Rivers impregnate with Gold, is not only thus conſtantly intimated by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Travellers thither of theſe Times, but atteſted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, in their further Diſcoveries many Years after; as may be ſeen in Father <hi>D'Acuna</hi>'s Relation of the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authors. But as for the rich City of <hi>Manoa,</hi> juſt before ſpoken of, which they had called <hi>El Dorado,</hi> it ſeems now to have been invented by theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> as a gilded Bait to draw the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> into League with them againſt their Enemies; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, to inhance the Merit of their Travels, and ſharpen the Appetite of their Succeſſors to purſue the Enterprize; for no ſuch City having been found, it has been reputed a Kind of <hi>Philoſopher's Stone</hi> in <hi>Coſmography:</hi> Yet, like that in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> tho' undiſcover'd itſelf, it was, and may further be the Means of many profitable Diſcoveries.

            <p>About the 9th of <hi>July</hi> following, the whole Fleet ſet ſail from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and, for two Days, had a fair leading Wind; in which Time all the Ships received their Directions from the Council of War, with the Meeting-places from Time to Time in Caſe of Separation by Tempeſt, Fight, Chaſe, or any other Accident. But being now advanced about ſixty Leagues, there aroſe ſuch an exceeding high Storm full in their Teeth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for four Days together, that all the Ships were driven, with great Detriment to ſeveral, back into <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and many died of the Sickneſs it had brought upon them. While they lay here Wind-bound for a Month, and their Proviſions much damaged and conſumed, <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in company, with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> rode poſt to Court. The Earl was very forward in his Propoſals to ſet out again with the Fleet as ſoon as it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, or at leaſt one Half of it, being ſure the Enemy ſhould have felt the Weight and Charge of the Journey. But her Majeſty not accepting his Offer, it was more adviſedly reſolved, to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their Expedition to the Opportunities which remained; the Seaſon being ſo far elapſed, and their Proviſions ſo much exhauſted: therefore <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> had Orders from her Majeſty to diſcharge the Land Forces, all but the thouſand <hi>Low-Country</hi> Soldiers, then thought the beſt and moſt experienc'd of this army; whereby, though they were diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of diſembarking at <hi>Ferroll,</hi> and attacking the Enemy there by Land; yet <hi>Eſſex</hi> offered to ſend

            <p>During this Abſence of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Ralegh</hi> at Court, which was not above ſeven Days, there fell out ſuch exceeding tempeſtuous Weather as very much diſtreſſed the Fleet, both at <hi>Plymouth Road</hi> and <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next Day they were here for ſeveral Hours beaten and ſcattered about by a prodigious Storm, wherein one of the late taken Prizes, named <hi>St. Matthew,</hi> falling into a Head-ſea, and having her <hi>Sprit, ſail</hi> out, broke her <hi>Bolt-ſprit</hi> and <hi>Fore-maſt</hi> overboard, cloſe to the <hi>Partners.</hi> The Fall of Maſts alſo broke two Anchors, and carried the third away; and her <hi>Main-maſt,</hi> with her rolling and tumbling, had ſo looſened itſelf, that it was in Danger of breaking in the <hi>Step,</hi> whereby ſhe would ſoon have been ſunk, had not her Captain, Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> with great Reſolution and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, carried her into <hi>England,</hi> and exchanged her for another. In the ſame Storm the other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prize, the <hi>St. Andrew,</hi> ſpent her <hi>Main-top-maſt,</hi> and loſt Company for ſome Days; but all the reſt of the Fleet kept labouring in the Bay, till firſt <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and ſome Ships of his Squadron which happened to carry the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Soldiers, clear'd out, and made the beſt of their Way to the next Rendezvous: and afterwards ſeveral of the Earl's loſing him, ſailed thither alſo in ſearch of him. This gave Riſe to a Miſrepreſentation by <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Adverſaries, that he had deſignedly withdrawn himſelf and that Part of the Fleet; while <hi>Eſſex</hi> himſelf incurred a moſt juſt Cenſure throughout the whole Fleet, by making the high Land of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and bearing in ſo cloſe to the Shore, that he alarmed all the Country to make Defence againſt him. Afterwards as the Fleet, being joined again, was paſſing towards the South, almoſt as far as the Iſles of <hi>Bayon, Ralegh</hi>'s Ship, the <hi>Warſpite,</hi> being then in the Center of them, on the 27th

Here it was agreed, that till <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship ſhould be repaired, he might keep cruiſing about the Height of the <hi>Rock,</hi> where they were to unite, and paſs the <hi>South Cape;</hi> yet the next Morning, before that Reparation could be made, <hi>Raleigh</hi> had a Meſſage to attend <hi>Eſſex</hi> with all Speed, that they might put in with the Land, which was impoſſible for <hi>Ralegh</hi> to do, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to work upon a Wind, as having but a <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail</hi> and <hi>Mizen,</hi> and the Wind almoſt off the Land; beſides, if he could have made the Land with that Sail, it was thought Madneſs to put upon the Enemies Coaſt in that Condition; when, if the Wind ſhould change to the Weſt, he muſt, in Want of his <hi>Main-ſail,</hi> have yielded or periſhed: ſo found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neceſſitated to ply up and down for two Days, till the ſaid Fraction was mended. In this Diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was no Direction given for any other of the Fleet to attend upon <hi>Ralegh;</hi> yet Sir <hi>William Brook</hi> in the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> tarried with him; alſo Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> very affectionately offered all the Aſſiſtance he could give; and ſeveral other of the Sea Captains voluntarily did the like: but <hi>Ralegh</hi> would admit of no more than three or four ſmall Men of War to accompany him, and ordered the reſt, even of his own Squadron, to repair to the <hi>Admiral:</hi> So far was he from projecting a Diviſion of the Fleet, by entreating any to forſake <hi>Eſſex</hi> and abide with him, as it was afterwards very falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented, to incenſe <hi>Eſſex</hi> againſt <hi>Ralegh,</hi> for contriving the Fruſtration of their firſt reſolved Attempt; and as <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, when they met at the <hi>Azores,</hi> ſo ſatisfactorily made evident, that the ſaid Imputation turned only to the Shame of its Contrivers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0181500200:235"/>
When <hi>Ralegh</hi> had repaired the Damages of the Storm, he here in with the Coaſt, making all the Enquiry he could after <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Fleet, but could hear no Tidings of them; he ſent into the Iſles of <hi>Bayon,</hi> and towards the <hi>South Cape,</hi> well knowing the Earl could not then put into <hi>Feroll</hi> or the <hi>Groyne,</hi> as was afterwards colourably pretended he would have done had they united, the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flat againſt him; and the whole Fleet having over-ſhot that Coaſt near 20 Leagues before the Main-yard of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship was broken; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that they could not recover it again, both thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes were wanting which only were to have been ventured in the Service. Hereupon <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſhaped his Courſe to the <hi>Rock,</hi> which was appointed for the general Rendezvous; expecting, not only with good Reaſon, to meet <hi>Eſſex</hi> there, but with great Deſire; his own Force being ſo ſmall, and the Enemy, as he heard, out at Sea with a powerful Fleet. Yet thoſe who could ſuſpect <hi>Ralegh</hi> would prefer a Separation, dangerous and diſadvantageous as it was now, would needs have had it thought there was much more Reaſon for that Suſpicion, when there came to <hi>Ralegh</hi> at the <hi>Rock</hi> near 30 Sail more, moſt of them his own Victuallers and Tranſports; but the Truth is, that having loſt <hi>Eſſex</hi> during the Storm in the Bay, and miſſed him alſo at the <hi>North-Cape,</hi> they came hither according to their Inſtructions; where, caſually meeting with <hi>Ralegh,</hi> he held them together, and conducted them to <hi>Eſſex</hi> at the Iſlands: Otherwiſe they had all return'd home, after they had failed at the <hi>South Cape,</hi> which was the third and laſt Meeting-Place, of ſome Admiral to command them, and of whom they would have fail'd, ſince none of the Fleet went ſo far ſouthward.</p>
            <p>Soon after he had determin'd, in Search of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0181500200:236"/>
Fleet, to paſs on towards the <hi>South-Cape,</hi> he was travers'd by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bark, which aſſur'd him they had learn'd from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War which had lately taken an <hi>India-man,</hi> that the <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantado</hi> was gone for the Iſlands to convoy the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Fleet ſafe home. This ſeeming very probable, and no one ſuſpecting that any of their Countrymen would traiterouſly delude her Majeſty's Fleet with any falſe Informations in a Purſuit of this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Ralegh</hi> earneſtly beſought the Captain of the ſaid Bark to hunt after <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and appriſe him of this Intelligence: But he anſwer'd, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Company, that the Captain, who had taken that <hi>India man,</hi> had already ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Eſſex</hi> thereof. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> doubting it might have miſcarried, or that none was ſent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one of the ſmall Men of War attending upon himſelf with all Diligence to ſeek out the Fleet, and make Report of what they had heard. This Ship, by good Chance, met with the Fleet next Day, and deliver'd the News. Two Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Ralegh</hi> received two Letters from <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which ſomewhat taxing his Abſence, and not writing, requir'd that he would preſently follow him to the Iſlands: <hi>Whereunto (the Earl ſaid) he was haſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find the</hi> Adelantado; <hi>not doubting but to give his Miſtreſs a better Account of that Service, than he ſhould yield his Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In paſſing to the Iſlands, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was ſo much in Danger of loſing his Main-maſt, that he was forced to ſend the Ships in his Company before, becauſe he thought <hi>Eſſex</hi> might be in Want of them, if he ſhould meet the Enemy; and, if they had joined the Fleet without <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who was princpially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, in Caſe of any Engagement, it would have ſtrengthened the Miſconſtructions that had been nouriſhed againſt him; but <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſo ſpeedily
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0181500200:237"/>
and effectually repaired his crazy Maſt, and ſo briſkly ply'd his Sails, that he overtook his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts next Day, and on the 8th of <hi>September</hi> they all made the Iſland of <hi>Tercera;</hi> yet here could they meet with no News of the Fleet, though they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant who had traded about theſe Iſlands above ſix Weeks, and though it had paſſed that Way but two Days before. By this Merchant <hi>Ralegh</hi> wrote into <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint the State in what Situation they were; then paſſed on to <hi>St. George</hi>'s Iſland, where they found the Weather exceedingly hot, and were vexatiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd for a Day or two, before they could get forward to <hi>Gratioſa.</hi> Here, as they coaſted along, on the 10th of <hi>September</hi> about Midnight, they ſaw a large and perfect Rainbow by Moon-light, in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Mariners having obtained Leave to go aſhore at <hi>Flores,</hi> to water and furniſh themſelves with ſuch other Neceſſaries as they wanted; while he himſelf, attended by ſeveral other of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Gentlemen, walked a Mile or two into the Iſland to ſtretch their Legs and refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, where they all dined in a little Village, the bare-legged Governor having cauſed ſuch Fare to be brought them as the Country afforded, which they very honourably paid for, without offering them the leaſt Injury; becauſe the Earl had before given them an Indemnity, under his own Hand, from all Manner of Violence: When <hi>Eſſex,</hi> impatient to be in Action, all of a ſudden, and before the Sailors could get their Caſks of freſh Water aboard, ſent, on the 16th of <hi>September,</hi> Capt. <hi>Arthur Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> to tell them, <hi>That the General was borne up for</hi> Fayall, <hi>meaning preſently to take it in; therefore required them to follow him inſtantly; and though they ſhould not overtake him, yet to find him there as ſoon as they could, and there they might ſupply their Wants.</hi> Hereupon they haſtened away, with all the Sail they could make, after him; but no Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral could they overtake. The next Morning they got Sight of <hi>Fayall,</hi> and miſs'd of <hi>Eſſex</hi> alſo there, to their great Diſſatisfaction, he being ſix Leagues

nearer that Iſland when he ſent for them, and ſet ſail thither ſix or eight Hours before them.</p>
            <p>Being entered the Road, they beheld before them a very fine Town, pleaſantly ſeated along the Shore; from whence the People, upon Sight of their Ships, began to pack away both Bag and Baggage: Their Friars, Nuns, other Women and Children, they alſo ſent away in Carts and Carriages: ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranſporting all up into the Country for two Days together. There was beſides a ſtrong Fort at one End of the Town, and another on the Top of a very high Mountain near adjoining, by Nature very inacceſſible, and artificially fenced with Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Rampier, and a Ditch; alſo ſix Pieces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and 200 <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Garriſon; not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning others quartered about the Iſland. They fired upon <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ships as he anchored in the Road, though without much Damage, and ſet a great red Standard up in Defiance before his Eyes. They ſent moreover ſix Companies with their Colours to entrench upon the Shore, in Order to oppoſe his Landing. However <hi>Ralegh,</hi> in his Barge, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Sir <hi>Arthur Gorges</hi> and Captain <hi>William Morgan,</hi> rowed cloſe along the Shore-ſide, and by the high Fort towards the Town, to acquaint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the moſt proper Place for making a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent when <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould arrive; from whence they were ſaluted with divers Muſket-ſhot, which they very fortunately eſcaped, having with them neither Targets nor Armour for their Safeguard.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Provocations, and the Want they grew in of thoſe Neceſſaries, wherewith they were both lately hurried from accommodating themſelves, and promiſed they ſhould be ſupplied here; <hi>Ralegh</hi> called a Council of the Captains and Officers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about taking of the Town, if <hi>Eſſex</hi> arrived not; thinking it a Shame to forbear ſo fair a Prize, ſo

near at Hand, 'till they had carried all off; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the Enemy had begun the War upon them, and ſo proudly dared them to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Further, theſe Bravadoes, with the Hopes of Wealth in this goodly Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Ranſom of Houſes and Priſoners, made all the Mariners and Soldiers not only ready to mutiny that they were ſo long reſtrained; but reflect on their Commanders, as if this Forbearance was the Effect only of their Fear. And what made them the more eager was, that they ſaw no Likelihood of other Benefit by this Voyage, than what was thus to be gotten aſhore. Notwithſtanding theſe Murmurs, and that they heard no News of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in two Days, the Council was divided; and ſome of the Captains, who were his moſt flattering and ſervile Dependants, as Sir <hi>Guilly Merrick,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Parker,</hi> and others, were by no means for landing without his Knowledge; but <hi>Ralegh,</hi> with Sir <hi>W. Broek,</hi> Sir <hi>A. Gorges,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Harvey,</hi> and many other Commanders and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his own Squadron, were of a contrary Opinion; judging the General would repute them Idlers and Cowards to lie ſo long before ſo good a Town with ſo many Ships and Men, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but let them convey away their Effects. This was the general Voice both of the Land and Sea-Forces; yet the violent Perſuaſions of <hi>Merrick</hi> did ſo prevail, that they agreed to delay the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize one Day longer; when, if the Earl did not come, they all agreed to land together.</p>
            <p>Now, the Wind tacking about, ſomewhat unfit for the Road they lay in, <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and divers of his Squadron, with many other of the Ships after him, weighed, and coaſted about the the Point to the North-weſt Side of the Iſland, ſome four Miles further from the Town than they were before, and there let fall their Anchors, being a better Road
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0181500200:243"/>
than the firſt, as the Wind ſat. But <hi>Merrick,</hi> with ſome five or ſix Ships of his Conſorts, would not advance with them. They were now in the fourth Day of their Arrival before <hi>Fayall,</hi> and no General appear'd; but the Proſpect of a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting Country, full of little Villages and fruitful Fields, which ſharpen'd the general Deſire of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſupply their Want of Victuals, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Water, wherewith they had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited ſince their firſt ſetting out from <hi>Plymouth;</hi> therefore, by Agreement, they mann'd out a Barge, a Long-Boat and Pinnace, with 60 Muſkets and 40 Pikes, rather to guard themſelves in water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than in Expectation of any Encounter from the Town or Forts on the other Side of the Iſland. But they were no ſooner ready to put off from the Ships, than they diſcover'd ſix Enſigns of Foot, and ſome dozen Horſe-men, marching down ſpeedily from the Town and Forts to meet them; and made ſuch Haſte, that they ſoon poſſeſs'd the Trenches towards the Shore where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lay, and where, with brandiſhing Swords; and waving Colours, they ſtood daring them to a Rencounter. Hereupon, <hi>Ralegh</hi> found it neceſſary to augment his Force, which <hi>Brook, Harvey,</hi> and other Sea-Officers, readily ſupply'd, to the Number of 160 Men more. Then ſaid <hi>Ralegh</hi> to them, <hi>Seeing theſe</hi> Spaniards <hi>and</hi> Portugueſe <hi>are ſo gollant to ſeek or follow, and keep us from watering, we will try our Fortunes with them, and either win our Landing, or gain a Beating.</hi> As <hi>Ralegh</hi> then rowed along by his Ships, he was greeted by <hi>Bret, Sidney, White, Berry,</hi> and other Captains of the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Soldiers, who call'd out and advis'd him, <hi>to take them and ſome of their Companies with him; for, if he ventured to make the Shore only with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and his own Attendants, without their Land-Soldiers,</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0181500200:244"/>
               <hi>he might receive a diſcreditable Repulſe.</hi> But <hi>Ralegh</hi> excus'd himſelf, ſaying, <hi>he did not know for what Service the Earl might deſign them; and therefore was reſolv'd, with his own Company, to make the Deſcent, and then ſhould ſend for their Recruits; by which he would undertake to lodge them that Night in the Town, and the next in the Forts: Beſides, he was willing to make the Attempt with thoſe of his own Squadron, that neither the General nor his Train ſhould have Cauſe to be aſham'd of them for undertaking that in the Face of their Enemies, which they durſt not of themſelves follow and perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Ralegh,</hi> having thus a Party of 260 Men, not half the Number of the Enemy, made forward; and while ſome Ordnance, he had judiciouſly placed before him in Pinnaces, as cloſe along the Shore as they could lie, were beating upon their Trenches, he ruſhed through or under them as faſt as his Oars could ply to the Landing-place; which was guarded firſt with a mighty Ledge of Rocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40 Paces long into the Sea, and afterwards trench'd and flank'd with Earth and Stone, having only a narrow Lane between two Walls for their Entrance. But now, as they approached ſtill nearer to the Shore, the Enemies Shot flew down ſo thick upon them, that not only ſeveral of the common Men, but of thoſe who would before have paſſed for very forward and valiant Leaders, were much diſmay'd; inſomuch that <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who moſt gloriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd himſelf no leſs their Chief in Courage, than he was in Command, did not ſpare openly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them aloud with many reproachful Words. At laſt, when he ſaw them ſtill linger, through Conſternation, as much to their Danger as their Diſgrace, he commanded, with a loud Voice, his Watermen to row his own Barge full upon the Rocks, and bade as many as were not afraid, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0181500200:245"/>
him. Hereat ſome Boats ran in with us (ſays my Author) and out of them were landed Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rett,</hi> then a Penſioner, afterwards Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Brook,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Harvey,</hi> Sir <hi>John Scott,</hi> Captain <hi>Henry Thynne,</hi> Captain <hi>White,</hi> Captain <hi>Arthur Radford,</hi> Captain <hi>W. Morgan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Duke Brook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Rudgeway,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walter Chute,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Allen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charles Mackart,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen. So, clambering over the Rocks, and wading through the Water, he made his Way pell-mell, through all their Fire, with Shot, Pike and Sword, up to the narrow Entrance; where he ſo reſolutely purſued his Aſſault, that the Enemy, after a ſhort Reſiſtance, gave Ground; and, when they ſaw his Forces preſs faſter and thicker upon them, ſuddenly retiring, they caſt away their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and betook themſelves to the Hills and Woods. The like alſo did thoſe who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd higher: And thus did he win this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous Landing, together with the Trenches of the Enemy. A few of his Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were drowned and ſlain, more hurt, and a couple of Long-boats ſunk; yet was not his Loſs ſo conſiderable as to detract from the Juſtice of thoſe Congratulations which were paid him by the Officers of the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Forces, when, with ſome of their Companies, they arrived upon the Iſland, and found the Footing he had won ſo ſtrongly fortified and guarded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralegh,</hi> thus recrulted, being now near 500 ſtrong, thought beſt to go through with the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and prepare the Town in Readineſs for <hi>Eſſex.</hi> Therefore he appointed <hi>Bret</hi> to the Office of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant-Major, directed the other Captains to advance their Colours, marſhal the Companies, and ſo, in order, marched to the Town, about four Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Landing-Place. In their Paſſage
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0181500200:246"/>
divers of the Enemy, who had before braved them with the greateſt Inſolence, came with white Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins at the End of Staves, and voluntarily abaſed themſelves to Offices of the greateſt Servility. There was indeed a Way, two Miles about, by which they might have paſſed to the Town, and avoided the high Fort where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lay in Garriſon. But <hi>Ralegh,</hi> conſidering the Trouble of their March, the ſultry Heat of the Weather, the Hazards of Delay, and, above all, the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity they were under of immediate Supplies, took the ſhorteſt Courſe; reſolving to bring Fort and Town all into one Days Work. Thus, at the Head of about 40 Gentlemen of the beſt Rank, <hi>Ralegh</hi> led on the Companies in a gentle regular Manner, full in the Face of the Fort, having only his Leading-Staff in his Hand, and no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on but his Collar, for which he was ſomewhat cenſur'd by his Friends; for, when they came within Reach of the Fort, they were ſhrewdly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd with ſeveral fierce Storms of great and ſmall Shot, which came thundering down upon them from all Parts of it, wounding ſeveral, <note n="*" place="bottom">Among the reſt, there was one Captain <hi>William Morgan,</hi> a brave old Soldier, in this March; who, being reproved by our Author, Sir <hi>A. Gorges,</hi> for coming to the Field only in his Doublet and Hoſe, without either Armour or Target, anſwer'd, <hi>That his Fleſh was of Muſket Proof.</hi> Immediately after a Muſket Ball ſtruck him point-blank upon his Belly, and, with the Force of its own Blow, fell flat at his Feet, leaving only a black Spot or Bruiſe upon his Skin;—thanks to the Buckle that join'd his Girdle; deſerving to be repoſited among thoſe Trophies in the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> which Witneſs he wants not one Brother Soldier's impenetrable Suit of Mail, nor the ſeven-fold Shield of another, who can encounter his Enemy behind the Curtains only of a Pair of Proverbs, atteſting <hi>How little Armour will ſuffice, that is well-plac'd;</hi> and, <hi>How much Fortune favour the bold.</hi>
               </note>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome, and putting moſt of his Men into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order: Inſomuch that <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, with his
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0181500200:247"/>
little Vanguard, was no ſooner paſſed, and enter'd under the Covert of their Trenches and Barricadoes at the Declivity of a little Hill, but the reſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the main Body of his Forces, which, 'till now that they found themſelves under the Mercy of the Enemies Fire, advanced in good Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to break their Ranks, and, from marching, fell to running on in a ſtraggling and confuſed Manner 'till they were under the Walls and Trenches almoſt as ſoon as their Leader, who came ſome twelve-ſcore Yards before them in a ſteady and deliberate March. <hi>Ralegh</hi> was ſomewhat moved to ſee this tumultuous and timorous Courſe; and more, to think that the Enemy ſaw themſelves were the Occaſion of it; therefore he cried out to <hi>Bret, Berry,</hi> and other Captains, demanding, <hi>If theſe were the Men that ſhould have done him ſuch Service in Landing, and ſaved him from Diſhonour? Or this the Manner of their</hi> Low-Country <hi>Troops, to ſhew ſuch baſe Cowardice at the firſt Sight of an Enemy, and at the Muſket-ſhot ſo far off from a Fort?</hi> The Captains, who were themſelves brave enough, knowing the Truth would be the beſt Apology, anſwered, <hi>That theſe Companies who had behaved themſelves with ſuch Irreſolution, were indeed Men taken out of</hi> Fluſhing <hi>and</hi> Brill, <hi>the cautionary Towns; ſo were raw Soldiers, who had ever lived in a ſafe Garriſon, and ſeldom or never ſeen an Enemy, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered with Shot in the Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus got under Covert of the Trenches and Walls which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had abandoned, and retired to their Fortifications on the Top of the Hill, <hi>Ralegh</hi> commanded Capt. <hi>Bret</hi> to appoint a Serjeant or two, with a few Shot, to go view and diſcover the Way to the Town, which, in many Places, lay open, as well to the high Fort here in the Way towards it, as to the other Fort at the End
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0181500200:248"/>
thereof: And where the Ways were fenced, they were ſtill more dangerous; it being with low-piled Walls of looſe-ragged Stones, which <hi>Ralegh</hi> juſtly ſuſpected would increaſe, rather than obſtruct the Miſchiefs of their Enemies Artillery. <hi>Bret</hi> brought Word of a general Unwillingneſs in the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Serjeants to undertake this Diſcovery, ſo much under the Command of the Fort and Hill; and that the Troops were rather deſirous of ſlipping by, in the moſt haſty, diſperſed and unobſerved Manner they could; which <hi>Ralegh</hi> would by no Means ſuffer, through Conſideration of their Safety, without urging the Regard he had to their Credit in this Enterpriſe; for being by this Time well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed, the Iſland could raiſe 1000 armed Men, and, reaſonably believing they would gather their greateſt Strength for the Defence of their beſt Town, towards which he was now marching, he concluded they would have it more in their Power to defeat him, advancing in little diſorderly and ſcattered Parties, than in a regular united Body. <hi>Bret</hi> did make ſome Offer himſelf to go and ſurvey theſe Paſſages, if he ſhould be expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but indeed it was found he could not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſpared among his own raw and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Troops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When</hi> Ralegh, <hi>therefore, ſaw all Men ſo ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of this Undertaking, and eſpecially thoſe Garriſon-Soldiers, he told them,</hi> That he would not offer that to any Man which he would himſelf refuſe: That though it were not the Duty and Office of a chief Commander to undergo ſo ordinary a Service, but what duly appertained to the inferior Officers and Soldiers; and, notwithſtanding (ſaid he) that I could therefore enforce others to do it, they ſhall well perceive that I myſelf will do that which they dare not attempt; wherein I am aſhamed on their Behalf, that our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0181500200:249"/>
and we are thus abuſed in our Opinion of theſe <hi>Low-Country</hi> Soldiers. Then he called for his Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs and his Caſk, and ſaid, he would both go view the Way for them, which they made ſo nice of, as alſo the Paſſages and Aſcents to the Hill-top; and, as well as he could, obſerve the Strength and Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, for their better Direction the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hereupon, Capt. <hi>Berry</hi> was very ready to go, and earneſtly deſired me (ſays our Author) to divert our Rear-admiral from undertaking it; and I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (continues he) did openly diſſuade him, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief, from putting his own Perſon to theſe inferior Offices of Hazard, fitter for a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Serjeant, than himſelf, to perform; knowing that all the Direction, as well of thoſe Troops, as alſo of a whole Squadron of the Navy, did, at that Time, only reſt upon him, in the Abſence of the Admiral and Vice-admiral. Notwithſtanding he was obſtinate therein; as well in ſcorn of thoſe who had refuſed, as alſo indeed, out of a Deſire to be better informed of the Strength and Fortifications of the high Fort. When I ſaw him reſolved, I told him that I would, out of the Love of a Kinſman in particular, and alſo out of an honeſt Regard, take ſuch Part as he did, from whom I had received many kind Favours, and accompany him; but not out of any great Deſire I had to go about a Piece of Work, which conſiſted of much Danger, and little Honour in the Performance. He thanked me for my offer, but yet wiſhed me not to go, if it were againſt my Will: Notwithſtanding I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, and ſo did ſome eight or ten more of our Servants and Followers. But I ſay truly, and ſo afterwards it was much ſpoken of, that there was not any one more of Quality that did accompany him in that Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>In this Manner, and with this Number, did <hi>Ralegh</hi> in Perſon go; the only one, it ſeems, who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0181500200:250"/>
deſpaired not of Succeſs, to diſcover the Aſcents to the Hill; the Cannon ſhot of the Enemy, and thereby the Stones of the battered Walls, flying on every Side thick about him all the while. He ſtill proceeded, with an undaunted Pace, to compaſs this Knowledge of the ſafeſt Way by which he was to lead the Reſt, though he perceived Wounds and Death dealt on either Hand, and his own Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at every Step, more unavoidable. Some of his Company, in the March, were hurt, and two had their Heads taken from their Shoulders; Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Gorges</hi> had his left Leg ſhot through with a Muſket-ball, who, without remembering any Pain it gave him, obſerves the Bullet burnt both his ſilk Stocking and Buſkin, as if they had been ſinged with a hot Iron. <hi>I was then hard by the Rear-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral (continues he) who alſo was ſhot through the Breeches and Doublet-ſleeves in two or three Places. And ſtill they plied us ſo faſt with ſmall Shot, that, as I well remember, he wiſhed me to put off a large red Scarf, which I then wore; being, as he ſaid, a very fair Mark for them. But I, not willing to do the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſo much Honour at that Time, though I could have wiſhed it had not been on, anſwered the Rear-admiral again, That his</hi> white <hi>Scarf was as eminent as my</hi> red; <hi>and therefore I would now follow his Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having, by this Time, made a ſufficient Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, both of the Way for his Troops to paſs, as alſo of the Avenues to the high Fort on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which he intended to attempt, after he had ſecured the Town; Capt. <hi>Berry,</hi> with <hi>Allen,</hi> and ſome others, advanced to him. Hereupon he ſent ſome Guides to Capt. <hi>Bret,</hi> with Orders for him alſo to march up with the Companies, that they might unite before they came to the Town, becauſe he there expected an Engagement; or, at leaſt,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0181500200:251"/>
ſome Salley out of the Fort at the End thereof, which they muſt needs paſs before they could get at the Town; and which ſeemed to threaten Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being a very fine Fortification, all of ſtone Work, with Curtain, Flankers, and Ditch, very artificially caſt. But immediately, upon <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Approach with the Body of his Men, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it ſeems, abandoned it; for when he entered it, he found they were newly departed. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he marched on, he found the Inhabitants had alſo forſaken the Town, and left him in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, with ſuch Wares and Stores as could not ſuddenly be removed. Thus, though with much Danger indeed, and ſome Loſs of about half a ſcore Men, with the Hurt of little above double that Number, <hi>Ralegh</hi> made himſelf Maſter, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, of the whole Iſland; which ſupplied him, from his own Experience, with an Example to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Aſſertion, he afterwards took Occaſion to maintain, and which we have, in Part, touched upon before; alledging, <hi>That a Country cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an Enemy's Fleet from landing its Army, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as good a Fleet to oppoſe it.</hi> And this Example, in his own ſummary Account, we have here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, as what may give the Reader a double Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, both in confirming the Veracity of that which has been here extracted thereof from Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Gorges,</hi> and adding to the many other Inſtances of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Modeſty and Reſtriction, who could, in the Recital of this Action, be ſo much leſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the brave Steps he took to this Victory, with the Dangers and Difficulties he ſurmounted by Sea and Land, than that honourable Hiſtorian has been, who was a Witneſs of them.</p>
            <p>This Town, of which <hi>Ralegh</hi> was thus poſſeſs'd, was called <hi>Villa Dorta,</hi> as I find in <hi>Linſcthoen;</hi> who alſo informs us, the People were moſtly of the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0181500200:252"/>
               <hi>Dutch</hi> Offspring, yet uſing the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Others, who likewiſe deſcribe it, reckon that it contained, even ſome Years before this Time, at leaſt 500 Houſes, built all of Sone, with tiled Roofs, and diſpoſed into fine Streets; beſides a handſome Church, Nunnery, and Friery; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with many pleaſant Gardens of delicate Fruits, and Wells of freſh Water: inſomuch that, for Bigneſs, it has been compared to <hi>Plymouth</hi> or <hi>Yarmouth;</hi> but in Situation, to <hi>Dover;</hi> and might probably now have been of as good Advantage to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> as it was eight Years before, to the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> had he not, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> obliged himſelf to ſo diſadvantageous a Delay in the Conqueſt of it. However, becauſe the Town was unwall'd, and he was to expect, if he lay there open and careleſly refreſhing himſelf, while his Soldiers were ſcatter'd about in queſt of Proviſions, he might eaſily be ſurpriz'd, without ſome good Orders and Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given before they fell to Reſt and Repaſt, he iſſued forth, at his Entrance, a Proclamation, that none ſhould ſtraggle twenty-ſcore Yards from the Town, without leave of an Officer, and then go upon their Guard, with fit Weapon and Company. He then made ſome ſtrong Barricadoes; planted a good Watch in proper Stations, and a ſtrong <hi>corps de garde</hi> in the Market-place, that others might, in Safety, bring together ſuch Booty as the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants had left behind.</p>
            <p>Thus having refreſhed and repoſed themſelves all Night, the next Morning, being the 22d of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> even before break of Day, they diſcover'd, bearing with full Sail, towards the Road of <hi>Fayal,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Fleet; he having been, all this while, making a kind of Wild-gooſe Chaſe after <hi>Indian</hi> Fleets, and the <hi>Adelantado,</hi> who, it
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0181500200:253"/>
ſeems, never ſtirr'd out to Sea this Year, with other like uncertain Adventures. Now, Sir <hi>Guilly Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blount,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Shirley,</hi> and ſome other fatal Friends and Cheriſhers of the Earl's Infirmities, ſoon interrupted, by their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating and diſtorted Repreſentations, all <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s further Intentions to ſecure the Iſland. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently poſſeſſed his Lordſhip's Head, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had taken this Opportunity to play over his Parts, and ſhew the World how well he could act the Conqueror, only to ſteal Honour and Reputation from the General; they knew the Earl's Temper was as ready as Tinder, to catch Fire at the leaſt Suggeſtion: For, as no Man alive was a more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Courtier of Fame, or more deſirous to be reputed matchleſs for Magnanimity and Enterprize; ſo none was more jealous of Rivals than <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or could leſs endure that any Man ſhould obſcure his Glory, how highly ſoever he might otherwiſe be in his Favour. But in divers other diſagreeable Colours, this gallant Action was further disfigur'd to the Earl, as the Contempt and Violation of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; from whence they infus'd, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of landing ſuch Forces without his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Leave, was not to be paſſed over without ſevere Puniſhment; and that it was fit a Court Martial ſhould be call'd, to cenſure the Offence and Breach of Order and Diſcipline. In ſhort, the unpardonable Crime was, that <hi>Raleigh</hi> dared to render himſelf more conſpicuous than any Body elſe. And he had been leſs culpable, had he been leſs ſucceſsful; they ſeeming rather willing to have endured Blame for any ill Succeſs which might have occur'd to him by their Abſence and Reſtraint of Aid, than allow of any Praiſe for his being victorious without them. Nay, there were not wanting ſome, among <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Commanders, who would needs ſhew the Volence
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0181500200:254"/>
of their Zeal for his Lordſhip in ſuch Extreams, as to throw out, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was well worthy of loſing his Head for his Labour. All which might well inſpire thoſe ſolid and durable Expoſures which he has, in ſeveral Places, made of ſuch envious and inſolent Uſage.</p>
            <p>Eſſex, <hi>thus exaſperated, ſpent all the Forenoon in reprehending, diſplacing and confining all the Land Captains and Officers who accompanied</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh; <hi>whilſt he, expecting rather Thanks, than ſuch a perverſe Interpretation of his Services, made ready his Barge to go on board the General and guide him to Land. But being entered his Ship, he found all Mens Countenances eſtranged as he paſſed through them; and when he came to his Cabin, the Earl, after a faint Welcome, began to accuſe him with</hi> the Breach of Orders and Articles. Ralegh <hi>anſwered,</hi> he knew not wherein he had been guilty of ſuch a Breach. Eſſex <hi>replied,</hi> there was an Article that none ſhould land any of the Troops without the General's Preſence, or his Order. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>deſired leave to defend himſelf, by thoſe Laws which himſelf as well as others had made, and his Lordſhip, with the Council of War had authoriz'd; then he ſhould find that no Miſdemeanor had been committed.</hi> For, ſaid he, there is an Article indeed, that no Captain of any Ship, or of any Company, if he be ſeparated from the Fleet, ſhall land any where without Direction from the General, or ſome other principal Commander, upon Pain of Death. But I take my ſelf, ſaid <hi>Ralegh,</hi> to be a principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander under your Lordſhip, and therefore not ſubject to that Article, nor under the Power of the Martial Law; becauſe a ſucceſſive Commander of the whole Fleet, in her Majeſty's Letters Patents, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and my Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> failing. Beſides, you agreed I ſhould land at this Iſland with you Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

whom I have attended theſe four Days; and, finding that you came not, though your were half a Dozen Leagues before me in your Way thither, I weighed Anchor, and could not but conclude, both that you thought me ſtrong enough to take this Iſland, and were gone yourſelf to take in ſome others. Yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained ſo long from landing, at Sir <hi>Guilly Merrick</hi>'s Entreaty, that I heard my own Company, even at my Back, murmur, and ſay that I durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. And, to tell you the plain Truth, my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, at firſt, was only to water, till I ſaw them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me in that braving Manner, which, with our Reputations, we could not then ſhun and give over, being already in our Boats for that Purpoſe: For, if I had intended the taking of the Town, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have removed ſo far from our firſt Road, which lay right before it. <hi>As for thoſe Officers and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who had been committed,</hi> Ralegh <hi>deſired</hi> "they might receive no hard Meaſure in his Cauſe; whatſoever his Lordſhip conceived to be miſdone, he he muſt take it wholly on himſelf to anſwer, being, at that Time, Commander in chief.</p>
            <p>With theſe and other Arguments <hi>Eſſex</hi> was ſo well pacified, that he went aſhore into the Town, and reſted himſelf in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Lodging. There <hi>Ralegh</hi> invited him to ſupper, and offered, if he meant to call the Matter further in Queſtion, to claim no Privilege or Favour; but would anſwer for himſelf more amply in the Morning. Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Blount,</hi> taking the Earl's Anſwer from him, ſaid, <hi>he thought my Lord would not ſup at all.</hi> To which <hi>Ralegh</hi> reply'd, <hi>That, for his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, he might, when he was invited, diſable it at his own Pleaſure; but if the Earl would ſtay, he ſhould be glad of his Company.</hi> In the mean Time, the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> very nobly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Care that no diſreſpectful Treatment ſhould

be offered to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> by the Practice of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, dealt with <hi>Eſſex</hi> to find how he ſtood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; and, the next Morning, aſſured <hi>Ralegh,</hi> that his Lordſhip ſought only ſome Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe the reſt would think him a weak and tame Commander, if he had not Satisfaction. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> conſidering he had done nothing unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, and very certain that he was ſucceſſively in the Commiſſion for the whole Command of the Fleet, therefore not ſubject to any corporal Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as alſo of the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi>'s ſincere and honourable Dealing, came again in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit <hi>Eſſex:</hi> Otherwiſe, remembring the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Truſt that Men ought to repoſe in ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliations, and the ſtrong Malice borne him by others in greateſt Favour with his Lordſhip, had deſigned to betake him to his own Squadron; and ſo to have defended himſelf, or forſaken the Earl. But the Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> after having given his Honour with great Kindneſs and Reſolution, that he would make himſelf a Party if any Wrong or Violence were offered, contrary to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Promiſe, perſuading him to go and ſatisfy the Earl, <hi>Ralegh</hi> took his Counſel; and all Things, after a little Debate, came to a calm and quiet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>The Promoters of this Diſturbance, however thus diſappointed of their End, ſcrupled not to ſhare in the Benefits of this reproved Victory, by lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreſhing themſelves not only that Night, but three or four Days after, in the goodly Town aforeſaid; yet were they juſtly puniſhed for their Envy and Ingratitude. For, had that Time which they ſpent in carping and cavilling at <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Conduct, throughout this brave Action, been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, according to his Meaſures, in purſuing it; the Birds, which thereby they ſuffered to fly out
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0181500200:257"/>
of their Cage, had well rewarded their Unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in taking them; and they would not have loſt, as now they had, the Ranſom of ſo many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners out of the high Fort; nor the Spoil which they had conveyed out of the Town for Safety to that Place: So that inſtead of Aſſiſtance to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Profit of this Conqueſt, <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Arrival brought only Means, as far as in them lay, to deſtroy the Honour of it.</p>
            <p>After the Army had plentifully regaled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the beſt Proviſions the Iſland would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and the diſgraced Captains were receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Favour and Command, they hoiſted ſail; having firſt, in Honour of their loſt Men, made the Town itſelf their funeral Pile, and carried all the Artillery, and other Stores they found therein, or in their Forts, to their Ships. On the 26th of <hi>September,</hi> they caſt Anchor at <hi>Gracioſa,</hi> where the Chiefs of the Iſland coming on board the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſubmitted themſelves with very acceptable Humiliation, and willingly brought ſuch Proviſions as were required for their Compoſition. This Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of thoſe People baniſhed all Thoughts in the Earl of further repairing, in that Place, the great Charges he principally had created by this Voyage: for, he ſeemed ſo charmed with Submiſſion, as to have diſregarded the Advantages it might have yielded; and fonder of having a Power over his Enemies, than of making any effectual Uſe of it. When they came to <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s, they heard Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet; at which, moſt joyful Acclamations rung through all their Ships: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few Hours after, they encounter'd and took three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes, bound from the <hi>Havanna.</hi> The greateſt of them being about 400 Tons bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, was a very rich Ship, as well for the Lading,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0181500200:258"/>
as the Paſſengers in her; and this, if not the other two, was taken by <hi>Ralegh;</hi> who, being neareſt, gave Chace, cauſed her to ſtrike and to yield. Theſe three Ships, eſpecially the laſt, were laden with Cocheneal, and other profitable Merchandize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Silver, Gold, Pearl, Civit, Musk, Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe, found among the Paſſengers, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, by the Merchants in them, to be richly worth above 400000 Ducats. When <hi>Ralegh</hi> had enquired from the Gallery of his own Ship, of thoſe who had computed the Value of theſe Commodities, and been ſatisfy'd it would at leaſt amount to that Sum, he ſaid, <hi>Although we ſhall be little the better for theſe rich Prizes, yet I am heartily glad, for our General's Sake; becauſe they will, in great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, give Content to her Majeſty; ſo that there may be no repining againſt this poor Lord for the Expence of the Voyage.</hi> Theſe Ships made a Diſcovery of forty Sale of <hi>Spaniſh Indiamen,</hi> whereof ſome were freighted with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Treaſure; and it was reported, that while three or four of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which were fallen among them, were rifling one that foundered, the reſt eſcaped, and recovered the <hi>Tercera. Eſſex</hi> upon this Miſchance, called a Council of War; and ſome of the Colonels, with other Land Officers made liberal Profeſſions of the daring Feats they would attempt, if Boats, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and Men were allowed, how vain and imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable ſoever they ſeem'd to the Sea Commanders. For they offered, with 1500 Men, to take both that Iſland and the Forts; but theſe, knowing the Difficulty of landing them, with their Artillery, on ſo dangerous a Place in ſo bad a Seaſon; beſides the Strength of the Fortifications, ſo well furniſh'd by this new Arrival, could not, cordially and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, give their Conſent, but urged many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary; yet, when the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi>

               <hi>Howard</hi> perceived this Incompliance would be uſed as a Handle at home for their loſing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet and Treaſure, he told <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that if he was ſo forward to have it attempted, both himſelf and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> were ready to venture as far as any of them; and that they would undertake to ſpare 3000 able Men out of the Fleet for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: but this ſecond Offer, thus abſolutely and ſolemnly made, though of double the Number, cool'd their Courage, upon a little Deliberation, who had made even the firſt; and ſo the Vapour was diſpelled.</p>
            <p>Hence they returned again to <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s <hi>Iſland,</hi> which they had left upon the Intelligence aforeſaid; and in this Road <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with a great Number of his Officers, coming on Board <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship, hung out the Flag of Council; wherein they conſidered about landing, and taking of the fair Town which lay ſo temptingly before their Eyes, being unwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and having but a ſlight Fort for its Defence by the Sea-ſide. <hi>Eſſex</hi> was for landing all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies immediately; but <hi>Ralegh</hi> deſired that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might firſt go and ſurvey the Place; becauſe the Billows were here, in ſome Parts, no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than where he had made the Experiment at <hi>Fayal:</hi> The Earl, at firſt, conſented; but, as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> was putting off, <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſtanding in his Gallery with Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blount,</hi> called him back in great Haſte, and ſaid he would go himſelf. As he was deſcending into his Barge, <hi>Ralegh,</hi> ſeeing him altogether unarmed, except with his Collar and Sword, called aloud to him, and <hi>deſired him to take his Coſk and Target of Proof with him, if he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approach the Shore; ſeeing ſo many Muſkets (above</hi> 400) <hi>lying there on the Reſt to oppoſe him.</hi> But <hi>Eſſex</hi> anſwered, <hi>That he would have none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he diſdained to take any Advantage of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen</hi>

            <p>This Deſcent being thus diſliked, it was reſolv'd, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſhould, with all the great Ships, lie as near before the Town of <hi>St. Michael</hi> as he could to keep them in continual Alarm; while <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in a Pinnace of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s, called the <hi>Guiana,</hi> with about 2000 Men in Boats, ſhould, by Night, convey themſelves about ſix Miles further than their firſt determined landing, to the Town called <hi>Villa Franca.</hi> Accordingly, they all landed the next Morning at this Town, without any Manner of Reſiſtance, while the Fleet kept the other in ſuch conſtant Dread and Confuſion, that they could not regard their Neighbours; to the End that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Army, having ſecured thoſe, might the better fall on the Back of theſe. But in vain did the Fleet look over the Hills and Plains, in expectation of them; for that other pleaſant Town of <hi>Villa Franca,</hi>

had ſo enchanted the Army, being full of Fruits, Wines, and freſh Victuals, that the Commanders, as well as their Soldiers, were content there to take up their Quarters, without further Thoughts of <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s Town; and, for ſix Days together, lay feaſting, and carrying on Board the Wheat, Salt, Woad, and other Merchandize, into certain private Mens Ships that followed the Fleet for ſuch Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. While <hi>Ralegh</hi> lay thus at Anchor, there came into the Road a Ship of <hi>Braſil</hi> laden with the Woods of that Name, and of <hi>Fernambuc,</hi> with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars as well as other Merchandize; and anchored full in the Midſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet.

But, as ſhe was bearing in, one of the <hi>Holland</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, contrary to Direction and to an Diſcretion, ſuddenly weighed Anchor, hoiſted Top Sail, and, as ſhe approached, made two or three Shot at her; whereupon, perceiving her Miſtake, ſhe nimbly changed her Courſe; at which Inſtant, the Wind changing alſo, ſo that he could not eſcape out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <hi>"ſhe, with the Help thereof, and with the Fear of falling into our Hands, ſays</hi> Gorges, <hi>run herſelf a ground cloſe under the Town and Fort.</hi> Here, finding <hi>Ralegh</hi> follow her, and her Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inevitable, ſhe diſcharged her Men in the Boats that flock'd about her, with ſome of her Wares, and was then inſtantly ſet on fire in many Places at once. <hi>Ralegh</hi> and his Men ſtill purſued to board her, and prevent her loſs; though not without great Danger in his Row-barge as he was, the Surge being very outragious; but by then he could get up to her, ſhe was all over Thunder and Lightning; her Ordnance diſcharging from every Port, and her whole Hulk, Maſts, Cordage and Furniture ſunk, over-run with ſuch a thorough, yet diſtinct and unconfus'd Blaze, as repreſented the Figure of a Ship more perfectly in Fire, than could be done by any Painter with all his Art and Colours: and, when ſhe was conſumed even to the Surface of the Water, ſhe exhaled as her laſt
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0181500200:263"/>
Breath, ſuch Clouds from her ſpicy Entrails, as, for a great Way, and for many Hours, perfumed the Air and Coaſt around. Had the Army then been at <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s Town, as was expected, it might have ſecured this Ship before ſhe could have diſembarked her Men, or, if it had terrified her back to Sea, ſhe muſt have been taken by the Fleet; and then the Treaſures ſhe contained, with thoſe in this Town, might probably have reimburſed the Charges of their Voyage; ſince our Author, laying this Loſs upon the ſaid Land-Forces, thought it ſo much to be lamented, that they were not to be excuſed.</p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Eſſex</hi> nor his Army being heard of in all this Time, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was in a Conſultation about drawing up the Fleet towards him, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Earl's Ship, by her Flag, turning out from the Point of <hi>Villa Franca.</hi> Then <hi>Ralegh,</hi> taking Capt. <hi>Morgan</hi> in his Barge, rowed to him, and, the ſame Night, ſent the Captain back with Directions, in the General's Name, to command all the Fleet to weigh and come to that Town. It much grieved the Mariners, to ſee the unprofitable Meaſures which were thus taken, and that they muſt relinquiſh the Advantages they might have made of the Town before which they lay. When the Fleet was got up to the Army at <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> a general Command was given that all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhould repair to their reſpective Ships, for the Time of Year approached that the Winds and Waves began to riſe too high for them to ride on thoſe Coaſts any longer: So they left this Town alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, upon what Conſiderations our Author knew not, but thought the Woad-mongers and Corn-Merchants might be moſt likely to reſolve the Queſtion.</p>

On the 9th of <hi>October</hi> they ſet ſail for <hi>England,</hi> and, after three or four Days, were violently toſs'd about and diſpers'd in a moſt tempeſtuous Sea. <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship was near being ſtemm'd by the Shock ſhe received from another that was driven againſt her, whereby ſhe became ſo leaky, that he had much ado to keep her above Water. He was further in ſuch great Diſtreſs for Want of Drink, that Sir <hi>Arthur Gorges</hi> proffer'd one of the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſix Cheſts of Sugar for ſix Hogſheads of freſh Water, but could not obtain it: Inſomuch that they were forced to ſet their great Stills on Work to furniſh themſelves in the beſt Manner they could. During this Storm, 'tis alſo obſerved, many Sorts of Birds flew into his Ship; and the Dove, that came among them, was look'd upon to preſage the Calm that enſued two Days after. When they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to meet again, they deſcry'd at a great Diſtance, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> accompanied with only two little Barks; who, about a Week before, was attended with 80 Sail of good Ships.</p>

with proper Neceſſaries, he ſent her round to the Fleet, and ſhe was paid off at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> with the Profits that aroſe from one of the Prizes he had taken before-named, Had as good an Account been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the other Prizes, this Expedition, for all the Caſualties and Overſights which happen'd in it, would have return'd her Majeſty double the Charge ſhe had been at in ſetting it ſourth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi> took his Journey to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where a Commiſſion came down from the State to Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> himſelf, and Sir <hi>F. Vere,</hi> with Monies for repairing, victualling, and ſending about the Fleet to <hi>Chatham;</hi> and for maintaining 1000 <hi>Low-Country</hi> Soldiers, which were now quarter'd along the Coaſt of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and afterwards ſent into <hi>Ireland. Eſſex,</hi> in the mean while, poſted away to <hi>London;</hi> but, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Advantage he might have in firſt ſhaping out the Story of their Adventures to the Queen, it little avail'd him; for Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſoon after arriving alſo at Court, underſtood his Lordſhip was retir'd to his Houſe at <hi>Wanſted</hi> in great Diſcontentment: For the Queen was ſo incens'd againſt the Earl, that ſhe laid the whole Blame of their evil Succeſs on his Lordſhip, both for not burning and ſpoiling the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet at <hi>Feroll,</hi> and miſſing that which came from <hi>India. Vere</hi> ſays, he juſtify'd his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and laid the Blame upon thoſe who deſerv'd it, with ſuch Earneſtneſs, that the Standers-by (her Majeſty then walking in the Garden at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall)</hi> might hear him: Inſomuch, that he quieted the Queen, as he tells us; who then diſcourſed with him of the Earl's Humours and Ambition, and, at laſt, conſtrued all ſo graciouſly, that ſhe fell into Commendation of him; ſo that he ſoon after came to Court. But he ſtaid not long there, nor with any Eaſe or Content; ſo inſupportable
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0181500200:268"/>
was it to find <hi>Cecil</hi> made Maſter of the Wards, the Lord-Admiral <hi>Howard</hi> created Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> for his Services againſt the <hi>Spaniſh Invaſion,</hi> and at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> and now <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Actions at the Iſlands, eſteem'd alſo more conſiderable than his own; tho' indeed by the fewer Number; for the Populace were eaſily led to believe the late Diſappointment of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s great Expectations, was owing to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Regard of his own Glory more than that of his Country; whereby <hi>Ralegh</hi> loſt their Opinion, even tho' victorious againſt their Enemies, while <hi>Eſſex</hi> was ſure to return with Triumph, however he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in his Attempts; and was always received by them with ſuch Joy, as if his great Fleets and Armies came laden with ſufficient Spoil and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, if they only brought him ſafe home again. Still both enjoy'd a liberal Share in the Queen's Favour, but it only ratify'd the Veneration of the Multitude to one, and their Diſaffection to the other; yet was their Eſteem more fatal to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> at leaſt more ſpeedily ſo, than their Prejudice to <hi>Ralegh.</hi> However, the Queen was little influenc'd with their Partiality to either; till <hi>Eſſex</hi> too zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly cultivated that which ſo unreaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd in his Favour; for ſhe loved her People without Jealouſy, nor was offended at his being the Darling of their Eyes, till ſhe found him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to be the Darling of their Hearts. And, as for the Blame which <hi>Camden</hi> ſays they now laid on each other of the late Miſadventures, and which, he informs us grew to a more open Rupture, it ſeems to have fallen moſt upon <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Conduct was approv'd; becauſe <hi>Eſſex</hi> was never after truſted with the Command of any naval Expedition, but <hi>Ralegh</hi> was. Yet whatever Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct in others <hi>Ralegh</hi> might be now driven to object, in his own Defence; his Generoſity to <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0181500200:269"/>
and ſome of his Followers, whom he might have laid it upon, many Years after their Death, when there was little Fear of being controverted, is ſo much above moſt of theirs to him while they were alive, that, having then Occaſion to mention this Voyage, he does not drop the leaſt <hi>inuendo</hi> againſt any of them; but aſcribes their Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it to the moſt unblameable Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Ralegh</hi> could well arrive, I think, at <hi>London,</hi> to give an Account of this Expedition, the Parliament was met at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> for we read, that the Queen went thither in an open Chariot, all cover'd over-head Canopy-wiſe with Silver Tiſſue, and begun the Seſſions on the 24th of <hi>October</hi> this Year. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> making but a ſhort Stay in Town, went to his Seat at <hi>Sherbourn;</hi> of which he muſt have had but little Enjoyment for two or three Years paſt. Towards the latter End of <hi>November</hi> following, we find Mr. <hi>Adrian Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> now a Burgeſs for <hi>Bridport</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> obtain'd Licenſe of the Speaker that he might retire to his Brother Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> in that County, for the Benefit of his Health. About a Month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that is, on the 20th of <hi>December,</hi> we meet with <hi>Ralegh</hi> in the Houſe; for what Place return'd, I find not; and that Day the Parliament was adjourn'd till the 11th of <hi>January.</hi> When they met again, <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears frequently in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, upon ſeveral Bills of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that were then read; as that againſt lewd and wandering Perſons pretending to be Soldiers or Mariners; another for an Act to encreaſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Service and Strength of the Realm; one to explain an Act for the Maintenance of the Navy; one for paying the Queen's Debts; one for erecting Houſes of Correction, and Puniſhment of Rogues, Vagabonds, and ſturdy Beggars; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0181500200:270"/>
many others; whoſe Titles are more proper to be ſought in the Parliamentary Journals of this Reign, than here barely to be recited: For the Clerk of this Houſe, ſeeming to have melted down moſt of the Speeches in this Seſſion, for Brevity, into a Narrative of its Proceedings, little or nothing of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Arguments is to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly extracted.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being diſſolv'd on the 9th of <hi>February, Ralegh</hi> ſeems not to have reſided long in Town; for, ſoon after, ſome Regulations being made for the publick Good of thoſe People over whom he preſided, by his Offices of Power, in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> we find him celebrated, for his Exerciſe thereof among them, as a very worthy Patriot in ſeveral Inſtances. The Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> is mention'd in one of them, who died about ſix Months after the ſaid Parliament broke up, that is to ſay, in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1598; therefore we muſt here relate it, as occuring before this Time. It concern'd the Reſtoration of certain Manors to their antient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in <hi>Cornwall;</hi> for there are 17 appertaining to that Dutchy, which took or renew'd their Holdings, as they call it, every ſeven Years of certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, for near three Centuries paſt; whereby the Tenants reckon'd a kind of inheritable Eſtate, accruing to them. But, notwithſtanding this long Preſcription, a bold and buſy Perſon in theſe Times, getting an Exchequer-Leaſe of one or two ſuch Tenements, called the whole Right in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but, failing of Succeſs, another, ſoon after, reſumed the broken Title, and proſecuted it even to a <hi>Niſi prius.</hi> Hereupon, the Tenants deputed certain Gentlemen, among whom was the Author of this Paſſage, <hi>Richard Carew</hi> of <hi>Anthony,</hi> Eſq; one of the Deputy-Lieutenants of the County, to repair to <hi>London</hi> with a Petition to the ſaid Lord-Treaſurer
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0181500200:271"/>
               <hi>Burghley;</hi> who, calling to him the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and Barons of the Exchequer, found (beſides this long Continuance, and the Importance thereof, as touching the Ruin of above 1000 Inhabitants) that her Majeſty poſſeſſed no Lands which yielded her ſo fair a Benefit as theſe, in Rents, Fines, Heriots, and other Perquiſites. Theſe Reaſons found favourable Allowance, but did not procure an effectual Remedy, till the ſaid Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Supplicants to her Majeſty in Perſon; who then, having been prepared, it ſeems, by <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Applications and Intereſt, teſtify'd her Diſlike of the Attempter; and expreſly order'd the Ceſſation of his Attempt. For, ſays this Author, herein we were beholden to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s earneſt Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who was then in the Country; alſo to the Advice of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Sollicitations of Mr. <hi>W. Killegrew.</hi> Another Example of his zealous Affection for the Eaſe and Advantage of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under his Juriſdiction, appears in his lightning them of a certain burdenſome Tax, which carried many other Inconveniences with it. For, as the Products and Commodities in thoſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts had been antiently very much oppreſs'd with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Earls of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a <hi>Corniſh</hi> Inhabitant and a <hi>French</hi> Peaſant differ'd very little; ſo latterly, while <hi>Ralegh</hi> was Lieutenant of that County, there wanted not ſome, who, through Favour at Court, and plauſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations to her Majeſty, did, in Part, revive the ſame; and, under Pretext of reſtoring a Rent decay'd ever ſince the Ninth of King <hi>Henry</hi> II. to the pretended Detriment of the Crown, procured Letters patent, that none ſhould ſalt, dry, or pack any Fiſh in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> or <hi>Cornwall,</hi> without their Licenſe or Warrant; the ill Conſequences whereof grew ſo apparent, as being what would have made
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0181500200:272"/>
that Patentee an abſolute Diſpoſer of all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Shipping and Traffick, with their Sea and Land-Dependants, that the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Juſtices, whereof Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> aforeſaid was one, made Suit to the Privy-Council for Redreſs; and, <hi>through the never failing Forwardneſs and Backing of Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, obtain'd a Revocation thereof. Here we may alſo add <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s good Offices, the two following Years, for freeing the Inhabitants of theſe Parts from thoſe heavy Impoſitions, with which the Trade and Manufacture alſo of their Tin-works were very much embarraſs'd. Theſe Impoſitions were occaſion'd by the Merchants and Uſurers who advanced Money to the Tinners, upon whom their Encroachments were now grown ſo exorbitant, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was importun'd to revive the Privilege of <hi>Pre-Emption,</hi> founded on that Clauſe in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>Edward</hi> I. allowing them to vend their Tin to their beſt behoof, <hi>niſi nos ipſi emere voluerimus.</hi> It had been attempted by others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, who alledg'd many Reaſons how it might prove advantageous, not only to her Majeſty, but the Country, and prejudicial to none but thoſe Extortioners, who practis'd a far worſe kind of <hi>Pre-Emption.</hi>

Thus ſome one Merchant will have 500 Pounds out before-hand, reaping thereby a double Commodity, both of exceſſive Gain for his Loan, and of Aſſurance of being ſerv'd with Tin for his Money. This they ſay is no Uſury forſooth, becauſe the Price of Tin is not commonly known before hand (for once only, within theſe 12 Years, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to eſcape the Penalty of the Law, they brought it a little under 20 <hi>l.</hi> the thouſand) but, if to take above fifty in in the hundred be Extremity, whatſoever Name you liſt to give it, this, in Truth, can be no other than Cut-throat, and abominable Dealing,'</q>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0181500200:273"/>
by thoſe Perſons hotly begun, and a reaſonable Price offer'd, it ſoon cool'd again, till it receiv'd a new Life in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, 1599; for then the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Men, being in <hi>London,</hi> were call'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the principal Lords of her Majeſty's Council, and the Matter was there debated by Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> in Behalf of the Country, againſt thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates deputed for the Merchants who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted this Suit; and he brought it to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that Articles were ſign'd. Indeed it did not immediately take Effect: Yet, it ſeems, the Privilege was afterwards inveſted in <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and that he put his Power in Execution. In <hi>November,</hi> the Year following, he held a Court at <hi>Loſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withiel,</hi> the uſual Place for Stannary Cauſes; where having ſignified her Majeſty's Pleaſure for a new Tax of ſix Pounds on every Thouſand Weight of Tin that ſhould be tranſported, beſides 2 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> already payable, he told them alſo, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had been prevail'd on ſo far to diſengage them from dealing with the Merchants and Uſurers, that ſhe would diſburſe 4000 <hi>l.</hi> in Loan to the Tinners for a Year's Space, and was contented to be repaid in Tin: And laſtly what appears totally to have excluded thoſe Merchants from the Exerciſe of their Impoſitions is, that, by the Time of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Parliament, <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears to have had the Power of Pre-Emption granted him; becauſe, in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0181500200:274"/>
a Speech of his, having juſtly maintain'd his Title thereto, from the Charter before-mention'd, he yet no leſs generouſly offers to reſign it, as indeed he not long after voluntarily did, if thoſe, who had Privileges of far leſs antient Eſtabliſhment, would follow his Example.</p>
            <p>But, to return a little into the more open and publick Current of Action, we muſt here obſerve, that King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> having, about the End of the laſt Parliament, informed the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> by an Ambaſſador, that he had held ſome Conferences with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters about a Peace, but would come to no Concluſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her Conſent, and that of the United States; her Majeſty ſent ſome Commiſſioners over: And, while they were negotiating this Buſineſs in <hi>France,</hi> ſhe had the Argument very cloſely debated in her Council at home. Here <hi>Eſſex</hi> was one of thoſe, who would by no means liſten to any Manner of Accommodation; and, while the Matter was upon the Carpet, was ſo expeditious as to produce a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Apology, in Writing, for his Reaſons; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dated in 1598, and written before the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Death in the Beginning of <hi>September</hi> the ſame Year. Yet, upon this Topic, there enſued a warm Diſpute, ſays <hi>Camden,</hi> between the Queen and <hi>Eſſex;</hi> as alſo upon her chuſing ſome able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to ſuperintend the Affairs in <hi>Ireland.</hi> She look'd upon the Earl's Uncle, Sir <hi>William Knolles,</hi> as a proper Perſon for that Charge. <hi>Eſſex</hi> preferr'd Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> perhaps on Purpoſe, ſays <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> to get rid of him: And, when the Queen would not be perſwaded to approve his Choice, he, quite forgetting all Duty, turn'd his Back upon her in a contemptuous Manner. The Queen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear his Inſolence, diſmiſs'd him her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with a Box on the Ear. The Fury this threw
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0181500200:275"/>
the Earl into, is better conceiv'd than expreſs'd; but having, with his Hand on his Sword, told the Queen, <hi>He would not have taken ſuch a Blow from her Father,</hi> he retired from Court. The Lord-Keeper <hi>Egerton</hi> ſent him a prudent and pacifying Letter; in which, among other wholſome Motives to Submiſſion and Complacency, he ſays, <hi>In this Courſe you hold, if you have any Enemies, you do that for them which they could never do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; while your Friends you leave to Scorn and Contempt.</hi> The Earl return'd a long and paſſionate Anſwer, as <hi>Camden</hi> calls it, in which it appears, he had alſo ſuffer'd ſome Impriſonment; and wherein he makes this Reply to thoſe Objections. <hi>In this Courſe do I any thing for my Enemies? When I was preſent, I found them abſolute; and therefore I had rather they ſhould triumph alone, than have me attendant upon their Chariots. Or do I leave my Friends? When I was a Courtier, I could ſell them no Fruit of my Love; and now I am a Hermit, they ſhall bear no Envy for their Love to me.</hi> But the Lord-Keeper ſoon brought him out of his Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage; and he was, in a little Time, re-admitted into the Queen's Favour. However, his Friends, according to <hi>Camden,</hi> were apt to date his Ruin from this unlucky Circumſtance: And indeed, it hence appears, he had no Enemies ſo great, or who ſo much conſpired to his Fall, as his own Paſſions, his unreaſonable Expectations of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Conformity to his own Will, and Impatience to behold any Body aſpire to Diſtinction, who did it not through his Patronage and Protection. Of this he gave a moſt notorious Example about this Time; in which he made <hi>Ralegh</hi> a publick Object of his Oppoſition, tho' it ended in his own Diſgrace, and his Relapſe into the Queen's Diſpleaſure; which he might have prevented, had he kept his Word
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0181500200:276"/>
to the Lord-keeper, and ſuffered <hi>Ralegh</hi> to have triumphed alone: for, during this Reconciliation, or laſt Blaze <hi>Eſſex</hi> made with any Credit at Court, this memorable Conteſt ſeems to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by him, at the martial Exerciſes performed on the Queen's Birth-day, which was the 17th of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe martial Exerciſes were the Juſts or Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith the moſt active Nobles and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers of thoſe Times celebrated the Queen's Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day every Year, in the <hi>Tilt yard,</hi> near her Palace at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> Here her Majeſty was commonly herſelf a Spectator of them, with her Attendants of both Sexes; as likewiſe all the foreign Ambaſſadors, and a numerous Concourſe beſides both of the Court and City. Hiſtory has not been very particular of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Appearance at thoſe Aſſemblies; as by what Colour or Impreſſes he diſtinguiſhed himſelf, with what Succeſs he ran the Carreers, or what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he bore away: But, as upon all other publick Occaſions, he made a moſt rich and ſplendid Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; ſo we find, upon theſe Days of Triumph, none ſurpaſſed him in military Bravery. I have ſomewhere read of his curious fine Armory; and, as I remember, that Part of it is, or was preſerved in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Lodon;</hi> but it is more apparent that, probably for ſome of theſe grand Entertainments, he either made himſelf, or was preſented by his royal Miſtreſs with, a Suit of Armour all of ſolid Silver: For there are ſtill in being, not only ancient Paintings, repreſenting him about this Part of her Reign in that glittering and warlike Habiliment; but mention is alſo made in ſome Writings of his being thus armed at all Points, and ſhining in thoſe poliſhed Plates of Silver. Yet who were his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, and what his Succeſs in theſe robuſt Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, there is little, I fear, remaining to ſatisfy us,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0181500200:277"/>
more than thoſe dark and diſperſed Hints of that extraordinary Oppoſition or Contention which <hi>Eſſex</hi> raiſed againſt him about this Time, as was obſerved: And this being the Original or Copy of a like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, practiſed not long before or after it in <hi>France</hi> (by Marſhal <hi>Biron,</hi> as I remember to have read) may, from thence, and the correſponding Teſtimony of an Author, whoſe Credit and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence are not to be doubted, be preſumed to have happened in the following manner.</p>
            <p>About the Time that <hi>Eſſex,</hi> by other like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his incurable Humour to monopolize the Multitude, fell into, or confirmed, the Queen's Diſpleaſure, he had by ſome of his Followers learnt, that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> with a very gallant Train, gorgeouſly accoutred, was to make his Appearance the next Tilting day in Orange colour Plumes. Hereupon <hi>Eſſex</hi> provided a much more numerous Cavalcade, and decked them out exactly in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Colours: Then the Earl himſelf appearing at the Head of all, armed <hi>cap a-pee</hi> in a compleat Suit of Orange-colour, not only paſſed for the ſole Knight or Champion of that Diſtinction, by drowning all Diſtinction in Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> but thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated him and his Train only as ſo many more of his own Eſquires, Pages, and other Retinue or Servants, who made up the Parade upon theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> certainly points at this malignant Stratagem, where, ſpeaking of thoſe dangerous Indiſcretions which were the Harbingers of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Ruin, he mentions among them <hi>His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious feather-triumph; when he cauſed</hi> 2000 <hi>orange-tawney Feathers, in Deſpite of Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>to be worne in the</hi> Tilt yard, <hi>even before her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's own Face.</hi> But it muſt have been ſomewhat ſurpriſing to ſee them enter the Liſts, and orange-tawney running againſt itſelf. Yet the Earl's Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0181500200:278"/>
which is alſo come to Light, ſeems not to have been much regretted, being ſo agreeable to the Merit of Uſurpers; inſomuch that it proved <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Feather triumph in the Concluſion. For, though the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> might have Reaſon not to mention the Earl's Name, where he tells us a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who came to the Tilt all in Orange-tawney, and ran very ill, came again the next Day all in green, and ran worſe; yet another Author, inſtead of this Gentleman, names <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and goes on, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> does, with obſerving, that <hi>One of the Spectators hereupon aſking, Why this Tilter (who ſeemed to be known in both Habits) changed his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;</hi> another anſwered, <hi>Surely becauſe it may be reported, that there was one in green who ran worſe than he in Orange-colour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such like Diſturbances and ill Blood as theſe Conteſts muſt have bred, might well make the Queen weary of having <hi>Eſſex</hi> any longer about the Court, and deſirous of removing him to ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment where he might more commendably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his martial Qualities. A good Occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered itſelf in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where <hi>Tir Oen</hi>'s Rebellion had now overſpread almoſt the whole Kingdom. A Conſultation was therefore held for ſending over the fitteſt Perſon to ſuppreſs it. The Lord <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> was firſt propoſed: But <hi>Eſſex</hi> himſelf made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt his Want of Experience and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; alledging, <hi>Ireland</hi> required a Perſon of the firſt Rank, who was an old General, and conſiderable for Honour, Intereſt and Eſtate, to gain him Reſpect and Influence there; by which <hi>Camden</hi> thinks he would have recommended himſelf, and adds, that when the Queen therefore reſolved on <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he ſlightly refuſed it, adviſing her to ſome abler Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; tho', continues that Hiſtorian, he had an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ready againſt any Perſon ſhe ſhould have
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0181500200:279"/>
have named.

About four Months after <hi>Eſſex</hi> was thus diſpoſed of, there were great Apprehenſions in <hi>England</hi> of an Invaſion; but from what Quarter is not well diſtinguiſhed: 6000 Soldiers were ſuddenly raiſed to guard the City and Queen's Perſon. Chains were drawn acroſs the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> Watches ſet, and Lights hung out at every Man's Door for above a Fortnight. By Sea 16 or 18 Ships of the Royal Navy were fitted out with wonderful Speed, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> as Admiral, in the <hi>Elizabeth Jonas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Vice admiral, in the <hi>Ark-Royal.</hi> Whether occaſioned by any Miſtruſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had of one another, or a Policy held on both Sides to make Peace with Sword in Hand, my Author does not reſolve; but is ſure the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration on both Sides was very great, as if one expected an Invaſion from the other: And yet it was generally conceived not to be intended by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that our Fleet had only Relation to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if he had ſome deſperate Deſign to try his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and to be revenged of thoſe he thought his Enemies. However it was, the Care and Coſt was not ſo great as neceſſary; for it was known, that the <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Another Benefit that aroſe to the Nation, by putting it into this ſudden Poſture of Defence, was the great Dexterity and Expedition wherewith it was taught to ſpring into Arms: For the incredible Speed and Order of the Commanders, in raiſing ſuch a Land Army, and fitting out ſuch a Royal Navy, was ſo admired, both by <hi>Spain, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners

confeſſed, <hi>Her Majeſty's Deeds in War were not heretofore more dreadful to her Enemies, than now only her Preparations for it.</hi> Inſomuch that, it is ſaid, an Envoy was ſent by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with Overtures of Peace, tho' they did not then ſucceed. Whether a deſigned Invaſion from <hi>Spain</hi> was hereby blown over, or her Majeſty was better ſatisfied about the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> we find not; but ſhe commanded her Fleet Home, after it had been about a Month at Sea.</p>
            <p>Near a Month after this, <hi>Eſſex</hi> returned private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with ſome of his choice Friends; one whereof, named Sir <hi>Chriſtopher St. Lawrence,</hi> offered to murder the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> whom they met upon the Road, and to diſpatch Secretary <hi>Cecyll</hi> when they came to Court; but <hi>Eſſex</hi> would not encourage ſo baſe an Act. The Queen was now at <hi>Nonſuch;</hi> hither <hi>Eſſex</hi> haſtened to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his Knees before her, in her Privy-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber early in the Morning, and when her Majeſty leaſt dreamt of him, ſays <hi>Camden;</hi> who adds, that ſhe entertained him with ſome Marks of her Grace and Favour, though not with that Freedom he uſed to find. The Queen indeed ordered <hi>Eſſex</hi> to his Apartment, and there to continue, as <hi>Camden</hi> goes on; for the Earl had not only diſoblig'd her before, but now given freſh Provocation by leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> without her Permiſſion, and for ſhuffling up a Truce there, which might be broke at a Fortnight's Warning; whereas he might have made an effectual Compoſition with the Rebels, and was impower'd to give them a general Act of Indemnity. The Excuſes he offered before the Council, were ſo unſatisfactory, and his Behaviour ſo contemptuous, that the Queen thought proper to commit him to Cuſtody; but appointed it to be in the Lord Keeper's Houſe rather than a common
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0181500200:282"/>
Priſon, chiefly to obſtruct the Infuſions of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Adherents, to whom he was ſo infatuated, that he could not relinquiſh them, though one of the Objections, which would be raiſed againſt him, was by his own Hand pre-ſuppoſed to be, the leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Kingdom in ſuch an unſettled Poſture, and returning into this, with ſuch a Pack of Swordſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at his Heels.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Eſſex</hi> was thus in Reſtraint, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were ſent over to <hi>Bulloigne</hi> to negotiate the Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> This was in <hi>May</hi> 1600. And about the ſame Time we find Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> was alſo ſent, with the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> upon an Embaſſy concerning the ſame, into <hi>Flanders.</hi> Their Buſineſs was kept very ſecret; yet, <hi>Albert</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and Governor of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> having charged the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> it ſeems, with relieving the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and being likely to take ſome Umbrage at ſo many Perſons of conſiderable Rank going over Volunteers to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> as the Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Lord <hi>Rutland,</hi> and others; Secretary <hi>Cecyll</hi> wrote to the ſaid Commiſſioners at <hi>Bolloigne,</hi> that if the Archduke ſhould object in the like Manner to <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Ralegh,</hi> they were to return Anſwer, <hi>That theſe had no Charge, nor carried either Horſe or Men, except ſome half Dozen of their own At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; and finding the Queen ſo reſolved to have a Peace (if good Conditions could be had) they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave, with importunity, to ſee that one Action (then expected) before they might deſpair of ſeeing any more of the like Kind in her Majeſty's Time.</hi> Thus much of this Matter we have in a Letter of Secretary <hi>Cecyll</hi>'s to thoſe Commiſſioners. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other written by Sir <hi>Henry Neville,</hi> who was one of thoſe Commiſſioners, to Mr. <hi>Winwood,</hi> he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it as a Report, that <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Ralegh</hi> were
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0181500200:283"/>
gone over upon Pretext to ſee the Camp and Siege of Fort <hi>Iſabella</hi> near <hi>Oſtend,</hi> before which Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> lay; but thinks they had ſome other End; and that in <hi>England</hi> there was ſome Alarm taken at theſe Matters, although he was not worthy to know it. The ſaid Sir <hi>Henry</hi> in another Letter to Mr. <hi>Winwood,</hi> ſays, that the Journey of <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Ralegh</hi> was not upon Curioſity only; but that they carried ſome Meſſage (to Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> it ſeems) which did no Harm, and that he would reveal the Particulars when he was better informed of them. Theſe three Letters were written in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> this Year, and in the firſt of them we perceive <hi>Ralegh</hi> was returned into <hi>England</hi> by the fourteenth Day of the ſaid Month.</p>
            <p>When he arrived at Court, the Government of <hi>Jerſey</hi> was, it ſeems, vacant by the Death of Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Amias Paulet.</hi> The Queen had many Addreſſors for this Preferment; but ſhe thought none ſo worthy of it as Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> About ſix Weeks after, that is, in the latter End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> his Patent was paſſed, with Grant of the Manor or Lordſhip of <hi>St. Germain</hi> in the ſaid Iſland, and all the Lands and Tenements therein. There is a learned Inhabitant of this Iſland, who in his curious and exact Hiſtory of it, giving us a Succeſſion of the Governors, ſays, <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>came in after the</hi> Paulets, <hi>the Year only before his Royal Miſtreſs Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>died; and was attainted the firſt Year of King</hi> James: <hi>ſo that we were ſoon bereaved of the Happineſs we promiſed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under ſo excellent a Perſon. His bare Name in the Liſt of our Governors does Honour to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland.</hi> Yet, as the ſame Author further obſerves out of the ſaid Patent, <hi>When Sir</hi> Walter Raleigh <hi>himſelf had this Government given him by Queen</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth, <hi>ſhe ſtruck off</hi> 300 l. <hi>a Year from it, which</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Eſſex</hi> had now been called before the Council at the Lord-keeper's, where, for the Matters laid to his Charge, he was ſuſpended from ſome of his Offices. But the Courſe of Penitence and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he held for a while, gave great Hopes, after he had obtain'd his Liberty, that he would recover himſelf alſo at Court; till his Creatures blew him up again with their poiſonous Counſels, and led him to expect not only a Reſtoration to Favour, but with unreaſonable Intereſt; <hi>inſomuch, that he neglected the Queen's Pardon, becauſe it came not accompanied with a new Grant of his Leaſe for the farming of ſweet Wines,</hi> as a noble Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, who adds, <hi>if ever that uncouth Speech fell from him of the Queen, which is delivered to us by one who was then much converſant in the ſecrets of the Court, that ſhe was as crooked in her Diſpoſition, as in her Carcaſe; all my Wonder at his Deſtruction is taken from me.</hi> After this Speech, the Queen did as good as deny him the Wine Licenſes aforeſaid, as <hi>Camden</hi> relates. Then <hi>Eſſex</hi> threw himſelf open to all ill Impreſſions, renewing the Project he had begun in <hi>Ireland</hi> of removing by Force his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Court. He curried Favour with King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by ſeveral reſpectful Letters; wherein he laboured to prejudice the King againſt thoſe who had any Influence in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and was very particular in acquainting him with the Intereſt of his Adverſaries; as one of whom he failed not to ſet forth Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> with the formidable Power he had in the Weſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and now again in the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey;</hi> that <hi>Cobham</hi> was Warden of the <hi>Cinque Ports;</hi> Lord

               <hi>Burghley,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>North,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in the South of <hi>Ireland:</hi> That thoſe were Places commodious for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to land; and theſe, Perſons well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and altogether, with the Lord Treaſurer, Admiral and Secretary, ſteer'd the Helm of Government. Then he practiſed with the ſaid King to ſend Ambaſſadors into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to preſs a publick Declaration of his Title to the Succeſſion, prepares Inſtructions for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſtill inſtancing the exorbitant Power of his Enemies, their Diſaffection to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and great Veneration for the Infanta. Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings were outwardly varniſh'd over, all this while, with the gloſs of Conſcience and Religion; he won over the Puritans and their Preachers to his Party, commiſerated the afflicted Condition of the Papiſts, retained a Crew of <hi>Deſperado</hi>'s to guard his Houſe, and left none uncountenanc'd, who had nothing to hope for, but Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus theſe ill Humours kept gathering till</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>the 8th of</hi> February <hi>following, and then broke out, as may be ſeen at large in our Hiſtories of theſe Times. At Court the Guard was doubled, being appris'd of this Eruption; and the Morning it happened, Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>ſent, out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kindneſs, to Sir</hi> Ferdinando Gorges, <hi>one of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s Adherents and Governor of</hi> Plymouth <hi>Fort, to come in all Haſte to him at</hi> Durham-houſe <hi>to ſpeak with him, and as the more private Way, that he would come by Water.</hi> Gorges, <hi>in the</hi> Manuſcript <hi>he writ to vindicate himſelf from the Imputation of betraying</hi> Eſſex <hi>by this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing avers, that he advertis'd his Lordſhip of this Meſſage, and that upon Council the Earl was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he ſhould go; but directing him to appoint</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0181500200:286"/>
               <hi>his Meeting with</hi> Ralegh <hi>upon the</hi> Thames, <hi>and not to land at</hi> Durham Houſe; <hi>alſo to take with him a Guard for ſecuring his Return. The Conference that paſſed between them, as</hi> Gorges <hi>relates it, was only this:</hi> When Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh's</hi> Boat came to me, he being all alone, and I having two Gentlemen, he told me that he had ſent for me to admoniſh me to make all Haſte out of the Town down to my Charge; there being a Warrant out for the ſending me to the Fleet. For his kind Advertiſement I gave him Thanks; but told him withal, becauſe I knew the preſent Occaſion would ſoon diſcover itſelf, that it came too late; for I had engaged myſelf in another Matter. He further inquiring of me, what it was? I told him, there were <hi>2000</hi> Gentlemen who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that Day to live or die Free Men. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted unto me he heard not of it until that Morning, but did not ſee what they were able to do againſt the Queen's Authority. My Anſwer was, it was the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of that by him and others, which made ſo many honeſt Men reſolve to ſeek a Reformation thereof. His Reply was, that no Man is without a Colour for his Intent; and adviſed me to look to myſelf, and to remember my Duty and Allegiance. I anſwer'd, that I knew not any Man who did not more reſpect his Allegiance than his Life, as the End would make apparent; and thus we parted; he to the Court, and I to Eſſex houſe. <hi>In the Confeſſion made by this</hi> Gorges, <hi>eight Days after that of their Inſurrection above-named, before ſome of the Privy Council, it appears, Sir</hi> Chriſtopher Blount, <hi>had perſuaded him to murder or ſeize Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>at this Meeting upon the Water. For not doing either,</hi> Gorges <hi>apologizes in the Manuſcript aforeſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Manner.</hi> If it be demanded of me why I did not then take Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> Firſt, It was not a Matter I ever propoſed; though many perſuaded
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0181500200:287"/>
me ſo to do. Secondly, I never held it an Act fitting among Men to betray any that repoſe Truſt in us; and he putting himſelf into my Hands, with what Honeſty could I have avowed ſo barbarous a Deed, unleſs he had given me the firſt Occaſion by violent Deeds or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Words; for either of which, I was both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and prepared. And at my Return, I deliver'd unto my Lord what had paſſed between Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and my ſelf, which he received with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, as may be teſtified by thoſe who were preſent, and yet alive. <hi>Laſtly, in another Part of the ſaid Manuſcript,</hi> Gorges <hi>ſays,</hi> The Reaſon why I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I had Means to have taken or killed Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was, the better to make it appear, that there was neither malicious or butcherous Courſe intended to him or any; and alſo to give him Cauſe to acknowledge himſelf in that Reſpect beholden unto me; whereby to take from him Occaſion to exerciſe his Power (which I knew to be great at that Juncture) to my Ruin. For I did believe, he could not in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ſo void of human Reſpect, as not to requite one Courteſy with another; and alſo it was no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Treaſon againſt her Majeſty, but rather a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the contrary, approving this Intent to be particular againſt Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and others. <hi>This is the Conference which paſſed between them a few Hours before the Inſurrection, as</hi> Gorges <hi>has repreſented it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After</hi> Eſſex, <hi>with his Party, had made ſeveral Excurſions, and ſome Perſons had been ſlain both on his Side and the Queen's. After he had been proclaimed a Traitor by the King of Arms in ſeveral Parts of the City; and was driven, by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſeek Garriſon in his own Houſe; we find</hi> Ralegh <hi>mentioned among the ſeveral Nobles and Knights who inveſted it; tho' he appears in no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Action againſt the ſaid Earl or his Company.</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0181500200:288"/>
               <hi>But when the Earl ſoon after ſurrender'd himſelf, and was brought to Examination, he profeſs'd that he was to have been aſſaulted or aſſaſſinated by his private Enemies; of this we have the following Account publiſh'd by Authority.</hi> As in all former Diſcontentments, he had gone the beaten Path of Traitors, turning their Imputation upon Counſellors and Perſons of Credit with their Sovereign: ſo now he was forced to deſcend to the Pretext of a private Quarrel; giving out, how that Evening, when he ſhould have been called before the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, there was an Ambuſcade of Muſketeers placed upon the Water, by the Device of my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> to have murdered him in the Way as he paſs'd. A Matter of no Probability (continues my Author) thoſe Perſons having no ſuch deſperate Eſtates or Minds as to ruin themſelves and their Poſterity by committing ſo odious a Crime. On the contrary, it was certain, Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> accuſed <hi>Blount</hi> perſuading him to kill, or at leaſt apprehend Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> and that <hi>Gorges</hi> rejecting this Advice, <hi>Blount</hi> ſent four Shot after him in a Boat, which <hi>Blount</hi> denied not; and asked <hi>Ralegh</hi> Forgiveneſs for it at the Time of his Death. <hi>But there were other Improbabilities to diſcredit this Slander (as we may ſafely call it, ſince the State call'd it by a groſſer Name) beſides that the Perſons ſo accuſed had Reputations and Eſtates bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtabliſh'd, than to overthrow them by ſuch a deteſtable Deed;</hi> as <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s declining to produce or name any Author of ſuch an Information: beſides his varying from himſelf (like the Judges, in the Story of <hi>Suſannah,</hi> from one another) in the Place; as one while he was to have been murdered in his Bed; and another, on the Water: alſo in the Time and Perſons; as that it was to have been done by Jeſuits, and ſome Days before: ſo that in the End, this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation

by <hi>Eſſex</hi> was reſembled to the Action of <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi> who proceeded ſo far in this Kind of Fiction and Diſſimulation, that he lanced his own Body, and came wounded before the People, as though he had been aſſaulted by his private Enemies; thus obtained a Guard about his Perſon, whereby he afterwards uſurped upon the State. <hi>Further, what may perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear up the Innocence of</hi> Cobham <hi>and</hi> Ralegh <hi>from this unworthy Calumny, is the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which</hi> Blount <hi>made at his own Trial; when, being aſked by Secretary</hi> Cecyll, Whether he thought my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> intended any ſuch Aſſaſſination of the Earl? he anſwered, that he did not believe they ever meant any ſuch Thing, nor that the Earl himſelf feared it; only, it was a Word caſt out to colour other Matters. <hi>And laſtly, what may tend to prove, that</hi> Ralegh <hi>did rather compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and incline to befriend the Earl, than harbour any Enmity that was implacable againſt him, is, that one of the Earl's own Faction, Capt.</hi> Thomas Lee, <hi>ſhould have ſuch Hopes, that</hi> Ralegh <hi>might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded into the Danger of diſobliging the Queen by Importunity, or other violent Means, for retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both</hi> Eſſex <hi>and</hi> Southampton <hi>from the Jaws of Death, as, by Way of Propoſition, to tell Sir</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Croſs, <hi>who had been an old Officer under</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>in ſeveral Engagements at Sea,</hi> That Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi> might get himſelf eternal Honour and Love, more than ever he can otherwiſe, if he would procure her Majeſty's Warrant to free the Lords; which he might compaſs, by undertaking her Perſon: <hi>for this does not only ſhew the Opinion that was held of</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Power with the Queen, but the Probability that he might be induced to exert it for the Reſcue of thoſe Noblemen. We find he did uſe his Intereſt for ſome who were drawn in una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and got a Pardon for Sir</hi> Edmund Bainham;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0181500200:290"/>
               <hi>alſo for</hi> John Littleton, <hi>and</hi> Orell <hi>a brave old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: the two former were Men of Fortune, and their Purſes might bleed, or be threatened upon this Occaſion. But, as</hi> Camden <hi>obſerves, few paid the Fines laid on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 19th of <hi>February, Eſſex</hi> was arraigned at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and we find, in his Trial, that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> with 40 of the Queen's Guard, was, as Captain thereof, there preſent upon Duty. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> was here examined about the Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned; and all he ſaid was, <hi>That</hi> Gorges <hi>told him on the Water,</hi> Eſſex <hi>had put himſelf into a ſtrong Guard at his Houſe; and this would be the bloodieſt Day's Work that ever was; wiſhing he would ſpeed to Court for the Prevention of it; and that he himſelf wiſhed</hi> Gorges <hi>to refuſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, elſe he would be undone.</hi> This is all <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid of that Conference; which <hi>Gorges,</hi> here alſo in Court, confirmed. But <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſeems to charge <hi>Gorges</hi> with Prevarication, where he replies, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>hath ſaid, differeth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that which Sir</hi> Ferdinando <hi>told us at</hi> Eſſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, <hi>upon his Return from the Water.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not likely he ſhould tell <hi>Eſſex</hi> he adviſed <hi>Ralegh</hi> to go to Court and prevent the Inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Six Days after, <hi>Eſſex</hi> was beheaded in the <hi>Court yard</hi> of <hi>London-Tower.</hi> Among the many Perſons of Diſtinction, there preſent was Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> probably in his Charge again as Captain of the Guard.

(who is known to us) he who betrayed him to his untimely End, as will be obſerv'd, did after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death, when he could not anſwer for himſelf, inſinuate, that he not only inſulted upon <hi>Eſſex</hi> being dead, but even plotted his Downfal, as that <hi>he had called the Earl's Saintſhip in Queſtion,</hi> had writ in ſome Letters, <hi>that the great Boy died like a Calf, and like a Craven,</hi> and that, ſoon after the Execution, a Gentleman, returning from <hi>Spain,</hi> touched at <hi>Sherborne,</hi> who, being aſked by <hi>Ralegh, what they ſaid in</hi> Spain <hi>of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s Death,</hi> anſwered, <hi>They had not heard of it; but he was ſorry to bear, that in the Iſland Voyage the Earl had brought him to his Mercy;</hi> to which, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>but I truſt I am now quit with him;</hi> and, as a more evident Demonſtration, ſays, that the Night before the Earl's Suffering, <hi>Ralegh gave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the Lieutenant of the Tower for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Warrant:</hi> Which ſurely he did not do without Authority. But theſe Particulars, it muſt be obſerved, come from the Perſon ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd with having enſnared <hi>Ralegh</hi> to his Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to the Perſon who deſtroy'd him, with Endeavour to Palliate the Conduct of both to the World. And as we find thoſe Obloquies gave not Satisfaction to their Author's Cotemporaries: So we have produced them, that they may not eſcape the Reception they deſerve of Poſterity. As for <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Comportment to <hi>Eſſex,</hi> we may gueſs what it was while the Earl was alive, ſince he made no Exceptions to it at his Death, when he had free Liberty of Speech; and when <hi>Ralegh</hi> came to the ſame End, it appears by his laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Words, that he had relented more at the Earl's Fate, than any Thing were hear of in his pretended Friends; and that he retir'd from the Sight of the Earl at the Time of his Death, in Compliance with the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0181500200:296"/>
of the Populace, though he afterwards repented it; ſince the Earl had a Deſire to ſee and ſpeak with him before he took his Farewel of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Deſire was, in all Probability, to aſk</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>Forgiveneſs, for having ſo diſhonourably treated and traduced him, to countenance his own raſh Purpoſes. For juſt ſuch a Deſire had Sir</hi> Chriſtopher Blount, <hi>when his own Execution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached on the 18th of</hi> March <hi>following at</hi> Tower-Hill; <hi>where, underſtanding that</hi> Ralegh, <hi>as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guard, was near the Scaffold, he ſaid,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> I thank God that you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: I had an infinite Deſire to ſpeak with you, to aſk you Forgiveneſs e'er I died; both for the Wrong done you, and for my particular ill Intent towards you: I beſeech you forgive me. <hi>Ralegh anſwered,</hi> that he moſt willingly forgave him, and beſought God to forgive him, and to give him his divine Comfort; proteſting before the Lord, that whatever Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Blount</hi> meant towards him, for his Part, he never bore him any ill Intent: <hi>And further ſaid to him,</hi> I pray you, without Offence, let me put you in Mind, that you have been eſteemed not only a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Provoker and Perſuader of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in all his undutiful Courſes, but eſpecially an Adviſer in that which has been confeſs'd, of his Purpoſe to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a great Part of her Majeſty's Army out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to land at <hi>Milford,</hi> and thence to turn it againſt her ſacred Perſon: You will do well to tell the Truth herein, and to ſatisfy the World. <hi>Blount reply'd,</hi> When I was brought from <hi>Reban</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and lodg'd in the Caſtle; his Lordſhip and the Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> came to viſit me; and he began thus plainly with me: That he intended to tranſport a choice Part of the Army of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and land them in <hi>Wales</hi> at <hi>Milford,</hi> or
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0181500200:297"/>
thereabouts: And ſo ſecuring his Deſcent, would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch other Forces, as would enable him to march to <hi>London. I anſwer'd,</hi> I would that Night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it. <hi>Next Day the Earls came again; I told them,</hi> Such an Enterprize, as it was moſt dangerous, would coſt much Blood; ſo as I could not like it. But I rather adviſed him to go over himſelf, with a good Train, and make ſure of the Court, than make his own Conditions; and tho' we never reſolved to hurt her Majeſty's Perſon, yet I know, and muſt confeſs, if we had failed of our Ends, we ſhould, rather than have been diſappointed, even have drawn Blood from herſelf. <hi>Then giving a few farther Hints of their Progreſs in general, he leaves the reſt to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions made before the Privy-Counſellors, whom he names, and to whom he beſeeches Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>to commend him for their favourable and charitable Dealing. Laſtly, having alſo declared he died in the Catholick Faith, and bid farewel to the Lords</hi> Gray, Compton, <hi>and the reſt, he made a decent End. Thus have we connected all the Paſſages of</hi> Eſſex<hi>'s Inſurrection, wherein we have found</hi> Ralegh <hi>any ways mention'd or concern'd; which, with ſeveral other remarkable Parts of his Story, thoſe Authors, who had read many of the Tracts, Letters, Records, and other Manuſcripts whence it is here drawn out, have viſibly curtail'd and ſuppreſs'd in their Annals and Chronicles of this Reign, which were publiſh'd in the next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Summer, in the Year 1601, it appears, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> attended upon the Queen in her Progreſs; and, when the King of <hi>France</hi> came to <hi>Calais,</hi> on the Alarm of the Arch-Duke's beſieging of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> her Majeſty was at <hi>Dover.</hi> Ambaſſadors were ſent over to each other on this Occaſion; and, in that private Diſpatch of the Marquis of <hi>Roſney,</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> related only by

himſelf, we find, that upon his landing at <hi>Dover,</hi> he was received by <hi>Ralegh,</hi> in Company with the Lords <hi>Cobham, Sidney,</hi> and others. The Interview, then expected between theſe two Princes, was not brought to paſs; nor ſeem the Propoſals, made to her Majeſty about the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> to have had the full Effect that was hoped for; becauſe, not long after, on the 5th of <hi>September,</hi> there arrived at <hi>London</hi> another Ambaſſador from <hi>France,</hi> named the Duke of <hi>Biron,</hi> with a very noble, numerous and ſtately Equipage, to the Number of 3 or 400 Perſons. The Queen was then in <hi>Hantſhire;</hi> and, during the 13 Days ſhe was entertained at <hi>Boſing,</hi> the Marquis or <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Seat, the Duke of <hi>Biron,</hi> with his Retinue, was brought to the <hi>Vine,</hi> a fair Houſe in the ſaid County, of the Lord <hi>Sandys,</hi> which was furniſh'd with 140 B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Soon after the Queen's Return from this Progreſs, her laſt Parliament met at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and that was on the 27th Day of</hi> October. <hi>This was a Seſſion</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:0181500200:300"/>
               <hi>full of important Buſineſs, and</hi> Ralegh <hi>appears fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently engaged in it. The firſt or moſt antient Liſt of the Members of the Houſe of Commons, at leaſt extant, is, as I have been told by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Antiquary, that which we have of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and herein it appears, that Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>was one of the Knights of the Shire for the County of</hi> Cornwall, John Arundell, <hi>Eſq; being the other; and that Sir</hi> Carew Ralegh <hi>was one of the Burgeſſes for</hi> Foway <hi>in the ſame County. The firſt Speech we have of Sir</hi> Walter<hi>'s, upon Record in this Parliament, was on</hi> November <hi>the 4th; and in Oppoſition to the Act for ſowing of Hemp.</hi> For my Part, ſaid he, I do not like this conſtraining of Men to manure or uſe their Ground at our Wills; but rather let every Man uſe his Ground to that which it is moſt fit for, and therein uſe his own Diſcretion. For Halſiers, Cables, Cordage, and the like, we have plentifully enough from foreign Nations; and we have Countries here in <hi>England</hi> that make uſe thereof in Abundance: And the Bill of Tillage may be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Motive to us in this Caſe, not to take the Courſe that this Bill intends. For where the Law provides, that every Man muſt plough the third Part of his Land; I know divers poor People have done ſo, to avoid the Penalty of the Statute, when their Abilities have been ſo poor, that they have not been able to buy Séed-corn to ſow it withal; nay, they have been fain to hire others to plough it; which, if it had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploughed, would have been good Paſture for Beaſts, or might have been converted to other good Uſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon this Motion, all the Houſe bid away with the Bill: But it was put to the Queſtion, whether it ſhould be committed or no? Some Doubt ariſing, the Houſe was divided; and the</hi> Yea's <hi>were 103, the</hi> Noes <hi>162; ſo the Bill was not committed. It was afterwards put to the Queſtion for ingroſſing;</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0181500200:301"/>
               <hi>and, notwithſtanding Mr.</hi> Comptroller<hi>'s Speech for the Weight of it (which is not preſerved) it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and ſo abſolutely rejected. Three Days after, Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>was at the Committee in the Houſe, touching the Subſidy. Here he moved them to conſider for what Intent they came thither, and now in their coming, what was to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For the Subſidy, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> the Manner and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, I will now only intimate thus much to you; that the laſt Parliament, only three Subſidies were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon fear that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were coming; but now we ſee they are come, and have ſet Foot even in the Queen's Territories already; therefore, are the more of us to be reſpected and regarded. And ſeeing the Sale of her Majeſty's own Jewels; the great Loans her Subjects have lent her, yet unpaid; the continual ſelling of her Lands, and decaying of her Revenues; the ſparing even out of her own Purſe and Apparel for our own Sakes, will not ſerve; but ſhe muſt yet be fain to call her Court of Parliament for our Advice and Aid in this Caſe; I wiſh, for my part, as a particular Member of the Commonwealth, that we may not do leſs than we did before; and that we may alſo bountifully, according to our Eſtates, contribute to her Majeſty's Neceſſities, as they now ſtand. <hi>This Speech was confirmed by many other Members, and met with no Oppoſition that we read of. But the manner of raiſing this Subſidy created ſome ſhort Debate; in which Sir</hi> Francis Haſtings <hi>moved, that the</hi> Three Pound <hi>Men might be exempted; and all others, above that Rate, to pay according to the</hi> Rate, <hi>to make up a full Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy. To this Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>anſwered,</hi> If all pay, none will be aggrieved; if any be exempted, doubtleſs it will breed much Grief; the feeling will be great to thoſe <hi>Three Pound</hi> Men that will feel any Thing, but it will be nothing to them that know
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0181500200:302"/>

For that being one of the principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this Kingdom, and being in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> it has ever (ſo long as there were any) belonged to the Dukes of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> and they had ſpecial Patents of Privilege. It has pleaſed her Majeſty freely to beſtow on me that Privilege, and that Patent; being Word for Word the very ſame the Duke's is. And becauſe, by Reaſon of my Office of Lord-warden of the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> I can ſufficiently inform this Houſe of the State thereof, I will make bold to deliver it unto you. When the Tin is taken out of the Mine, and molten and refined, then is every Piece, containing <hi>100</hi> Weight, ſealed with the Duke's Seal. And by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Privilege (which I now have) he ever had the Refuſal in buying thereof; for the Words of the Patent are, <hi>Niſi nos emere voluimus.</hi> Now I will tell you, that before the granting of my Patent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tin were but at <hi>17</hi> Shillings and ſo upward to <hi>50</hi> Shillings a Hundred; yet the poor Workman ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had but two Shillings a Week, finding himſelf: But ſince my Patent, whoſoever will work, be Tin at what Price ſoever, they have four Shillings a Week truly paid: there is no Poor that will work there, but may, and have that Wages. <hi>But, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Merit, as well as Right,</hi> Ralegh <hi>concluded, ſaying,</hi> Yet if all others may be repealed, I will give my Conſent as freely to the cancelling of this, as any Member of this Houſe. <hi>It is noted, that a great and uncommon Silence followed this Speech.

               <hi>laſt Sir</hi> Francis Haſtings <hi>ſaid, in Reſpect thereto:</hi> I joy to ſee ſo great a Reformation, that we may ſpeak quietly, and be heard peaceably; every Man has not alike Senſe or Judgment, neither is every Man's Memory alike. I wiſh, that if any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſpeaks of this, or any other Subject as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſhall let fall any Word amiſs or unpleaſing, that it may be attributed rather to Earneſtneſs, than Want of Duty. <hi>Throughout the further Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the numerous Monopolies now in Force, we find not any Mention made of his Patent afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, among thoſe which were particularly promis'd to be revoked or aboliſhed as Grievances to the State. On the 24th of</hi> November, <hi>Sir</hi> Edmund Morgan <hi>and Mr.</hi> Pemberton, <hi>both Members of the Houſe, being ſerved with</hi> Subpoenas <hi>to appear in the Court of</hi> Chancery, <hi>the ſame Day, at the Suit of Sir</hi> Walter <hi>and Sir</hi> Carew Ralegh, <hi>they had the Privilege granted them. The Officers, who ſerved thoſe</hi> Subpoenas, <hi>were taken into the Cuſtody of the Serjeant, but ſoon releaſed, upon pleading they knew not thoſe Gentlemen to be Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. This is all I find of that Suit concerning Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh. <hi>On the 2d of</hi> December, <hi>he ſpoke againſt the Defects and Hardſhips in a Bill that was read</hi> for Reformation of Abuſes in Inns; <hi>as that,</hi> it would deprive thoſe, who, by their Lordſhips or Manors, had Right to enquire into the Default of ſelling Liquors by full Meaſure, of their Privilege; that, by diſabling a Man for ever after of being an Inn-keeper, how detrimental it might be to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of thoſe who had Inns, ſome at <hi>100</hi> Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> and how dangerous to Inn-keepers, who might, by the Negligence of a Servant, ſuffer: All which he left to the Diſcretion of the Houſe. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other like Objections, by another Member or two, we hear no more of it.

               <hi>Means of ſuppreſſing the Pirates of</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>now grown ſtrong both in Arms and Shipping, came under the Conſideration of this Houſe. As one Remedy againſt them, it was propoſed, to reſtrain the Tranſportation of Ordnance, and a Bill to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the ſame was read a ſecond Time on the 8th of</hi> December; <hi>but, before it was committed, there paſſed many Speeches upon this important Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſeems, a Patent for tranſporting them had been granted to Sir</hi> Henry Nevill, <hi>and the Queen's Duty thereby roſe to 3000</hi> l. <hi>a Year; yet this Profit no Ways ballanced the Inconveniences. For, being carried into all Countries that were Friends with</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>and Confederates with</hi> Spain, <hi>the</hi> Spaniards <hi>had ſuch Plenty, that they now uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſold 100 Weight of Iron Ordnance for ſeven Ducats and a half. The Laws were moreover urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 33 of</hi> Henry <hi>VIII. and 2 of</hi> Edward <hi>VI. which prohibited the Tranſporting of Gun Metal; and tho' Guns were not then made of Iron, they now were; therefore it was within the Power of thoſe Laws.

            <p>
               <hi>On the 9th of</hi> December <hi>the Diſpute was renew'd, whether the Statute of Tillage ſhould be continu'd? This Statute was made in the Time of Dearth, and Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>agreed with thoſe who were for having it now repeal'd. His Reaſon for it was, becauſe</hi> many poor Men are not able to find Seed to ſow ſo much Ground, as they are bound to plough, which they muſt do, or incur the Penalty of the Law. Beſides, all Nations abound with Corn. <hi>France</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Queen to ſerve <hi>Ireland</hi> with Corn for ſixteen Shillings a Quarter, which is but two Shillings the Buſhel; if we ſhould ſell it ſo here, the Ploughman would be beggar'd. The <hi>Low-Countryman</hi> and the <hi>Hollander,</hi> who never ſow Corn, have, by their Induſtry, ſuch Plenty, that they will ſerve other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who often wants Corn, had we never ſo much Plenty, would never be beholden to the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> for it, neither to the <hi>Low-Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> nor to <hi>France,</hi> but will fetch it even of the very <hi>Barbarian;</hi> and that which the <hi>Barbarian</hi> has been ſuing for theſe <hi>200</hi> Years (I mean for Traffick of Corn into <hi>Spain)</hi> the King, in Policy, has ſet at Liberty of himſelf, becauſe he will not be beholden to other Nations. And therefore, I think, the beſt Courſe is, to ſet it at Liberty, and leave every Man free, which is the Deſire of a true <hi>Engliſhman. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other Speeches, it was put to the Queſtion, whether the Bill of Tillage ſhould be committed? and it paſs'd in the affirmative. But, it having pleas'd her Majeſty to licenſe Mr.</hi> Dormer, <hi>under</hi>

               <hi>her Letters patent, with a</hi> Non-obſtante, <hi>this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, to encloſe 300 Acres of Ground, he prayed the Houſe to admit of this Proviſo; therefore it was put to the Queſtion, and carried. The</hi> Noes <hi>demanded a Diviſion of the Houſe: Whereupon Mr.</hi> Richard Martyn <hi>obſerv'd, the</hi> Noes <hi>had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carried it in this Parliament when they came to a Diviſion; many ſtaying with the</hi> Yeas, <hi>becauſe they would not loſe their Places. Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>roſe to anſwer him; but many hurrying out to the Diviſion, he and</hi> Cecyll, <hi>it ſeems, took ſome Diſpleaſure; for, after the Diviſion, when Mr.</hi> Dormer<hi>'s Proviſo carried it again by a Majority, whereby the Houſe was ſet quiet, Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>ſaid,</hi> I thought I had deſerved of the Houſe to have been heard to ſpeak, as well as he that ſpake before the Diviſion; and in that I offer'd to ſpeak, and was not heard, I had Wrong: For him that laſt ſpake, it was out of Humour, and not out of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Notwithſtanding, I think it a Monopoly, and the Speech to be both Perſuaſion, and to lay a great Imputation upon the Houſe: And this is all I would have ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Next Day came on the Queſtion, whether the Tax for <hi>Dover-Haven</hi> ſhould be continued by Force of the Statute; which was Three Pence a Ton for the Burthen of every Ship. One Member, Mr. <hi>Swale,</hi> objected, that the Charge amounted to at leaſt a Thouſand Marks a Year, yet the Haven was never the better; and that it was grown a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial Wiſh of any Tax, that it would not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue like that of <hi>Dover-Haven.</hi> But Mr. <hi>John Boys</hi> ſhewed the Conveniency of this Haven, and how many hundred Pounds worth of Stones were ready to repair it: Sir <hi>John Forteſcue</hi> alſo obſerv'd, what large Ships of Burthen it would receive; how neceſſary it is for the Paſſage of all Merchants:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0181500200:311"/>
As alſo that the Tax was ſmall, and the Time might be when it would need a great Tax at one Time. Laſtly, Mr. Comptroller having likewiſe expreſs'd how imprudent it was to take away this Tax, now they were debating how to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> which would weaken the moſt neceſſary Haven of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was more particular in theſe Words: <hi>There are divers Havens which have been famous, and now are grown to decay, as</hi> Tinmouth, Seaton <hi>and</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelſey; Rye <hi>is of little Receipt;</hi> Sandwich <hi>(as a Burgeſs of that Town, Mr.</hi> Peak, <hi>ſaid this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is even a going. The Tax being employ'd as it ſhould be, I hold it both good and neceſſary; and there is no Trade of Fiſhermen to</hi> Newfoundland, <hi>but by this Haven of</hi> Dover; <hi>which, if the Tax be taken away, and that go to Decay, her Majeſty ſhall loſe one of the beſt and moſt neceſſary Havens of</hi> England, <hi>which hath all the Commodities that Mr. Comptroller ſhewed, and lies oppoſite to all our Enemies Countries, who may ſoon be with us, and we not able to reſiſt them, or help ourſelves, ſhould we want this Haven. I think it therefore fit this Matter ſhould be conſider'd of, and committed:</hi> And ſo it was.</p>
            <p>The 12th of <hi>December</hi> was read, the third Time, a Bill for the more diligent Reſort to Church on <hi>Sundays,</hi> which produced ſeveral Speeches in the Houſe. The Recuſants were very numerous at this Time, no leſs than 1500 in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> affirm'd, which might be one Reaſon for now urging this Bill; but thoſe, who were no ways popiſhly inclin'd, perceived ſeveral inſufferable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in it; as Mr. <hi>John Bond,</hi> who, among other Arguments, was not for expoſing the Eccleſiaſtical Authority among their Enemies, as more impotent than a Twelve-penny Fine. At laſt there was a Proviſo added to it, <hi>That if any Man came eight</hi>

Say then there be</hi> 120 <hi>Pariſhes in a Shire, there muſt now come ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily</hi> 240 <hi>Church-Wardens; and ſay, that but two in a Pariſh offend in a Quarter of a Year, that makes</hi> 480 <hi>Perſons (with the Offenders) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: What great Multitudes this will bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! what Quarrelling and Danger may happen, beſides giving Authority to a mean Church-Warden! how prejudicial this may be!</hi> with divers other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt it, and Inſtances of the Ambiguities and Equivocations in it; and as for the Proviſo newly added, <hi>it was a plain Toleration from coming to Church;</hi> and the Parſon could not prevent or conſtrain any, if they read Service at Home. Hereupon it was put to the Queſtion, and the Houſe was divided; the <hi>Yeas</hi> went forth, and were 105, and the <hi>Noes</hi> within were 106; ſo it was thrown out by one Voice.

Ralegh</hi> took no Notice of them, and the Speaker being allowed to have no Voice, the Bill was thrown up, and they took their Leave of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Speeches <hi>Ralegh</hi> made in Parliament, which we have thus drawn together, as far as they are upon Record, he appears in the Committees of many other Bills, and in ſeveral Conferences with the Lords, as may be ſeen in the Journal Books of both Houſes; but being only mention'd in general, we need not here be ſo particular as to recite them: Therefore ſhall only obſerve, that the Commons, having granted the Queen a liberal Subſidy, and her Majeſty given her Royal Aſſent to Nineteen publick and ten private Acts, this laſt Parliament, in her Reign, was diſſolv'd on the 19th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

            <p>In the Beginning of the Year 1602, Mr. <hi>Carew</hi>'s Dedication of his <hi>Survey of Cornwall</hi> is dated, as was before intimated; wherein that Author has, with ſuch Energy, copied forth the moſt amiable Diſtinctions of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Mind: This agreeable Picture thereof, and the many other noble Attitudes in which we have ſeen it diſplay'd, have made me inquiſitive what Portraitures remained of his Perſon,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0181500200:314"/>
that we might better judge of the Correſpondence between them; how well, in one Aſpect, the Sprightlineſs of Genius conſorted with the Solidity of Judgment; how well, in one Figure, the Roughneſs of War, with the Splendor and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of Courts. I have, at laſt, had the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing theſe Characters united in that Portrait of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> ſtill remaining with the Deſcendants of his Family. <note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis in the Poſſeſſion of Captain <hi>William Elwes,</hi> Nephew of the Lacy <hi>Elwes,</hi> Grand Daughter of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> and to that Gentleman we are oblig'd for the Liberty of bringing the ſame into Pr nt.</note>It is a half Length, repreſenting him in the ſilver Armour before-mention'd, and richly adorn'd in the Skirts, the Sword and Belt with Diamonds, Rubies and Pearls.

Another Painting I have alſo ſeen of him, and this is at full Length; probably an Original. It agrees very well with the Foregoing, in the Form of the Face, and Colour of the Hair and Beard; at leaſt as far as may be expected from the Hands of different Artiſts, ſome Alteration perhaps by Repairs, and ſome Difference of Years in the Object; whereby he ſeems, in this laſt, more ruddy and tann'd than the other. For, by the Inſcription thereon, partly ſtill legible, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0181500200:315"/>
that this Picture was painted in this laſt Year of the Queen, above-mentioned; and that his Son <hi>Walter,</hi> who is likewiſe here drawn by him, was then eight Years of Age. Further, in this Picture the Stature of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures about ſix Feet, is well-ſhaped, and not too ſlender: He is apparell'd in a white Sattin pink'd Veſt, cloſe-ſleev'd to the Wriſt; and over the Body of it a brown Doublet, finely flowered and embroidered with Pearl; his Belt of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Ornament, in which hangs his Sword; and on the other Side, over the right Hip, is ſeen the Pommel of his Dagger. In his Hat, which he has on, is a little black Feather, with a large ruby and pearl Drop at the Bottom of the Sprig in Place of the Button. His Trunks or Breeches, with his Stockings and Ribbon-garters, fringed at the End, are all white; and Buff-ſhoes, tied with white Ribbons. His Son, ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his left Elbow, is fair and prettily featured; dreſſed in a blue ſilk Jacket and Trowſers, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down with narrow ſilver Galloon; Stockings blue, and white Shooes; Gloves in the right Hand, Hat or Cap in the left, and a ſilver Sword by his Side <note n="*" place="bottom">This Picture of Sir <hi>Walter</hi> and his Son, did belong to the <hi>Carews</hi> of <hi>Beddington,</hi> whence, by Marriage with a Daughter of the late Sir <hi>Stephen Leonard.</hi> Baronet, it was removed to <hi>Weſt-Wickham</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> near which Place, at a Gentleman's Seat, where there is a Copy that was taken from it, I lately ſaw it.</note>.</p>
            <p>A Year before this, the Lady <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Picture was alſo painted, as appears by the Date upon it. It is a half-length like the firſt, but painted on Board; a high finiſh'd Piece, in the labour'd Manner of thoſe Times, by ſome maſterly Hand; has been well kept, and is doubtleſs an Original. It repreſents her a fair handſome Woman, turn'd
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0181500200:316"/>
perhaps of thirty. She has on, a dark colour'd hanging-ſleeve Robe, tuffted on the Arms; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, a cloſe-bodied Gown of white Sattin, flower'd with black, with cloſe Sleeves down to her Wriſt; has a rich Ruby in her Ear, bedrop'd with large Pearls; a lac'd Whisk riſing above the Shoulders; her Boſom uncover'd, and a Jewel hanging thereon; with a large Chain of Pearl round her Neck, down to her Waiſt. Theſe are all the paintings I have ſeen of them, that I can count authentic, or moſt likely to bear any true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. But have been credibly inform'd of a Picture of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> in Miniature, taken not long before his Death; and another at large, repreſenting him alſo in a white Suit, which he had, beſet with Jewels, to the value of threeſcore thouſand Pounds; and that one Diamond thereof, worth a hundred Pounds, remained in the Family till the beginning of the late Queen's Reign. In this Picture there is a Ribbon-garter, fring'd at the ends, ty'd about his left Arm. This, according to the Tradition that remains in his Family, was his Lady's (otherwiſe might be thought one of the Queen's Favours at the <hi>Tilt-Yard)</hi> which he brought one Morning, when he was obliged to attend her Majeſty early, as a Token, that, for Diſpatch, he had rode 120 Miles ſince he took leave of her late the Night before. But ſuch a Number of Jewels, which might be call'd Extravagance in others, was no Expence to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> who had many other Kinds of Treaſure, as well as this in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes, or otherwiſe in Traffick with foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as for his ſtately Appearance in, by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them upon ſome ſpecial Occaſions, it is not only confirm'd by Circumſtances, in part before-mentioned, but alſo by ſome Authors; who are not expected to take Notice of it with great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:

All I think here further obſervable upon the Pictures of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> is, that after ſo many which may be called genuine, and many more pretended to be ſo, ſtill in being, there have been ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Occaſions of engraving his Effigies for his Books; yet we have never had, till now, more than <hi>two Sculptures,</hi> which can pretend to have taken from any paintings; that even theſe are different from any above deſcrib'd; and that all the reſt of the Copper Prints we have of him, whereof near half a ſcore might be reckon'd, are Copies only from the laſt of thoſe two. <note n="†" place="bottom">Of theſe two Sculptures or Prints of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> the firſt is an extraordinary Rarity; inſomuch, that many <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> and Antiquaries, who have ſearched after, and collected the graved Heads of eminent Perſons, for many Years together, have not ſo much as ever heard of it: The Felicity and the Favour are therefore the greater, that I have been oblig'd with the Sight of it by General <hi>Dormer,</hi> who has procur'd a freſh and fair Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it from <hi>France</hi> into his choice and coſtly Collections; for it is a <hi>French</hi> Piece, in the <hi>Octavo</hi> Size, and graved by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Leau,</hi> an Artiſt, who was encouraged by ſome of our Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in theſe Times for the Excellence of his Hand. It repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him in a cloſe-bodied ſilk Coat, laced; agrees pretty well in the Features with thoſe before deſcrib'd, eſpecially the high Forehead and cornering up of the Hair above the Right Temple. It has a Compartment or Group at the Bottom, diſplaying his Victory over the Fleet in the Bay of <hi>Cadiz;</hi> yet, in the large <hi>Latin</hi> Inſcription, expreſſing his Titles and Offices of Command, there is Mention made of his Government of <hi>Jerſey:</hi> So I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was graved between his Preferment thereto, and the Queen's Death. The other Print of him, is that which we ſee prefix'd to moſt of the Editions of his Hiſtory of the World, whether to the firſt Edition I am not yet certain, the oldeſt that I have ſeen being among the Heads, annexed to <hi>Henry Holland</hi>'s <hi>Baſilogia,</hi> was graved by <hi>Simon Paſs</hi> in the Year 1617, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him in a cloſe-bodied Suit, thickly laced; a full laced Ruff and Truncheon in his Hand: Alſo when he was more aged and corpulent, than we ſee him in any of thoſe before mention'd. By the viſible Eraſement of a long Inſcription that was at the Bottom, for the Subſtitution of that which is more brief, the Plate ſhould ſeem to have been graved before that Year; but by the Truncheon in his Hand, not till he had his Command as General for his laſt Expedition; yet, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably taken from ſome anthentic Painting, it lay moſt ready to be copied, when any Print was wanting for his leſſer Works. This is all I ſhall here obſerve upon the Pictures of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> and, for much of this, we are obliged to the Knowledge and Induſtry of the ingenious Mr. <hi>Vertue.</hi>

               </gap>t of the Particulars, we ſhall briefly relate of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> in this laſt Year of the Queen's Reign; a Voyage, which he now ſet out for the Supply of his Colony in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> is principally to be remembered. For tho' he had made an Aſſignment of his Patent to other Undertakers, as was before obſerved, yet they making no ſucceſsful Progreſs, he was ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0181500200:323"/>
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he had planted there, that he ſent to them almoſt every other year, even from the Time of the ſaid Aſſignment. For, beſides the five Voyages before epitomized, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chiefly was at the Expence of, for the firſt Plantation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> we are well informed of five Voyages more; which, ſince thoſe he ſet forth thither for the Relief of his Countrymen, as well as for further Diſcoveries of thoſe Parts, and Alliance with the People; and that the laſt of theſe Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, under the Command of Captain <hi>Samuel Mace,</hi> was made this Year. In all which Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> might very well have diſburſed forty thouſand Pounds, as was before obſerved; ſince, in a <hi>French</hi> Author I have found the two firſt Voyages only to <hi>Virginia</hi> coſt him and his Friends threeſcore thouſand Crowns: yet were not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo ſecurely eſtabliſhed in this moſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Plantation, as Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> would have had them; for, from the ſhort Account we have of this laſt Voyage, and other Circumſtances, we may obſerve the ſaid Colony was much impaired by the barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> as indeed <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Purſe ſeems alſo to have been by theſe frequent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications to it. Nor was it without much Blood, as well as Money, that this Settlement was at laſt fixed by the ſucceeding Undertakers in the next Reign; and all owing to the want of that timely and competent Aſſiſtance from the Queen or State, whereby the moſt worthy Attempts for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good were even in theſe, as well as other Times, ſo generally ſtarved. But <hi>Ralegh</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave ſome emphatical Reaſons for this Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; whence we may evidently perceive, it was to the Queen's conſulting ſo much, and relying upon the Perſuaſions of her <hi>Scribes,</hi> Men unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in all warlike or adventurous Enterprizes, narrow domeſtick Politicians, or mere Courtiers,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0181500200:324"/>
who were moſt conſtant at her Ear; that ſhe ſo frequently <hi>did Things by halves,</hi> as well in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Diſcoveries, as in Rewards and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, eſpecially of Military Men <note n="*" place="bottom">

Thus thoſe ſpeculative Counſellors, though they could not hinder brave and active Spirits from budding out into noble Beginnings, of moſt hopeful Benefit to the Commonwealth; yet could, by ſtopping the Channel of Supplies or Encouragements, <hi>blite</hi> them from advancing to any fruitful or profitable Concluſions; and this, only to bring down thoſe of ſuperior Service and Merit, to a Level with themſelves.</p>
            <p>Whether the Expence of thoſe Voyages was the Cauſe of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s ſelling, about this Time, his Eſtate, or ſome part of it, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is not ſo expreſly told us, as that it was become leſs advantageous to him ſince the late Rebellion in that Kingdom. But we find, that a little before Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> now Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Carigfoyl Kerry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Boyle</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Cork)</hi> not only bought a Ship

As for the Eſtate at <hi>Sherborne,</hi> it appears, he now ſettled it upon his Son <hi>Walter;</hi> and that the Deeds were drawn in <hi>Midſummer,</hi> this preſent Year, for ſo we have it from has own Words. This Settlement, as I underſtand it, was of the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Leaſe for 99 Years: For though the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> Dr. <hi>Henry Cotton,</hi> had the laſt Year aſſigned over to the Queen, the Fee and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance alſo of the ſaid Premiſes, and her Majeſty granted the ſame by her Letters Patent to Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi> before her Death, yet he did not make them over to his Son, 'till the ſeventh Year of her Succeſſor. The Reaſon of ſettling his Eſtate upon his Son at this Time, appears alſo to have riſen from a Challenge, which he had lately received from Sir <hi>Amias Preſton</hi> (who had been knighted at <hi>Cadiz</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſince we laſt ſpoke of him) and which <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſays himſelf, <hi>he intended to anſwer.</hi> The Cauſe of their Quarrel I never could meet with in Print or Manuſcript; yet conceive <hi>Ralegh</hi> had good Reaſon on his Side, becauſe he afterwards ſhewed publickly himſelf, how deliberate he was in his Preparations for it, by ſorting his Writings, and how reſolved, by ſettling his Eſtate. But from what excellent Hands ſoever Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> received his Information, that, upon ſome diſtaſte, Sir <hi>Amias</hi> ſent <hi>Ralegh</hi> this Challenge; we may be pretty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from what <hi>Ralegh</hi> has mention'd, that the ſaid Information, or this Author's Account of it, is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, where he adds, <hi>That Sir</hi> Walter <hi>declined it.</hi> Indeed, I agree he might do ſo, <hi>with ut any Abatement to his Valour, wherein he had abundantly ſatisfied all Poſſibility of Suſpicion, and with great Advancement of his Judgment; for having (continues</hi> Fuller) <hi>a fair and fixed Eſtate, with Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (Child he ſhould have ſaid) being a Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor (here he miſtakes again)</hi> and Lord-warden of

the <hi>Stannaries;</hi> my ſaid Author thinks, <hi>Sir</hi> Walter <hi>looked upon it as an uneven Lay to ſtake himſelf againſt Sir</hi> Amias, <hi>a private and ſingle Perſon, though of good Birth and Courage; yet of no conſiderable Eſtate.</hi> But if <hi>Ralegh</hi> did accept of the Challenge, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly he did, when he might have had ſuch fair Reaſon of Evaſion; thoſe Inequalities in <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> will either prove Sir <hi>Walter</hi> a generous Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or that the Injury he received from Sir <hi>Amias</hi> was indiſpenſable. Now this Repreſentation ſeems to have been officiouſly and unneceſſarily ſhaped to make <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Actions conformable with his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; for (continues our ſaid Author) <hi>this is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to what he has written ſo judiciouſly about Duels, condemning thoſe for ill Honours where the Hangman gives the Garland</hi>

But here we are no longer to take Notice of ſuch open Adverſaries; for now, in the very Cloſe of this Year, on the 24th of <hi>March,</hi> ends the long Reign of glorious <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and now ſets the Sun of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s external Honour and Felicity; yet, like that ever active Planet, will ſhine reſplendently to the Heavens, when he is clouded or eclipſed to Mankind. How he fell into this Eclipſe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, the only Luminary of Time paſt, does but dimly or doubtfully diſcover. All we can do, is diligently to aſſemble every unextinguiſh'd Spark which darts any Light this Way; then ſee if they will afford that Guidance to the Truth, by being congregated, which they have not yet been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to yield aſunder. And firſt, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have before read of the Prepoſſeſſions which <hi>Eſſex</hi> is affirm'd to have inſtill'd unto King <hi>James</hi> againſt <hi>Ralegh;</hi> and, after the Earl's Death, there are ſeveral Circumſtances imploying that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyll</hi> did the like. For tho' <hi>Cecyll</hi> and <hi>Ralegh</hi> join'd againſt <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his Faction; yet, when theſe were overthrown, they divided, and ſeem to have had a Trial of Skill with one another. And one Author ſays, that <hi>Ralegh,</hi> wanting Strength, tho' not Wit, to be the Treaſurer's Rival, <hi>periſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not thought to own Humility enough to be his Servant; it being more ſafe at Court to have many Enemies of equal Power, than one falſe ambitious Friend that has attained to the Abſoluteneſs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Cecyll</hi> ſeems to have uſed thoſe Arts of Inſinuation with King <hi>James</hi> before his coming into <hi>England;</hi> to which <hi>Ralegh</hi> could not bend himſelf. That he then held clandeſtine Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondences with <hi>Scotland,</hi> is apparent from that Story in Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> who tells us, <hi>that her Majeſty taking the Air on</hi> Blackheath, <hi>attended by</hi> Cecyll <hi>when the Poſt rode by; and, hearing he came</hi>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0181500200:329"/>
               <hi>from</hi> Scotland, <hi>ſhe called for his Packet:</hi> Cecyll, <hi>though he knew it contained Letters, which, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, were as ſo many Serpents, yet, making more ſhew of Diligence than Doubt, to obey, called in great Haſte for a Knife to rip it up; but, approaching at ſome Diſtance with it, he told the Queen it looked and ſmelled ſo ill-favour'dly, coming out of the filthy Budg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, that it muſt needs be aired firſt, becauſe he knew how offenſive ill Scents were to her Majeſty: So got Opportunity to ſeparate what he would not have ſeen,</hi> and ſhe ſmelt nothing of the Matter. One Talent above the Reſt <hi>Cecyll</hi> was not wanting in to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to this new Sovereign; and this was ſuch a Faculty of diſcovering Plots, as if he thought he ſhould be looked on as uſeleſs without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For, as a noble Author obſerves,</hi> It ſeemed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him, that there ſhould be Treaſons, as for the State, that they ſhould be prevented. And, though he created none, yet he fomented ſome Conſpiracies, that he might give frequent Evidences of his Loyalty; having not the Advantage of others in Perſon to gain Eſtimation, therefore did it by theſe eminent Services: <hi>And as for King</hi> James, <hi>he was ſo apprehenſive, ſo ſuſceptible of ſuch Impreſſions, that, when he was but croſs'd or diſturb'd in his Sports, he would charge People with Treaſon: Nay, we are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly told by thoſe who were otherwiſe Friends to his Memory, that his Carver, once at Table, giving him accidentally a Nick on the Finger (as he was routing in the Diſh) his Majeſty, at the Sight of his own Blood, could not forbear calli ng out Treaſon; and that</hi> Guſtavus Adolphus, <hi>King of</hi> Sweden, <hi>was wont to make himſelf merry with this Expreſſion: And all this inſtanced, by my ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to ſhew, that for any Clamour of this Kind King</hi> James<hi>'s</hi> Word <hi>was no</hi> Slander. <hi>But more directly to our purpoſe there is another Writer, who,</hi>

And when the King was arrived, there was Matter enough to exaſperate <hi>Cecyll</hi> againſt <hi>Ralegh,</hi> if through any Deſign of Recrimination, Sir <hi>Walter</hi> did preſent to his Majeſty <hi>a Memorial;</hi> wherein he reflected heavily upon <hi>Cecyll</hi> in the matter of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and vindicating himſelf, threw the whole Blame upon the other; further laying open (at the End thereof) the Conduct of <hi>Cecyll</hi> and his Father alſo, in the Matter of the Queen of <hi>Scots (his Majeſty's Mother)</hi> bitterly charging the Death of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Queen upon them. <hi>However, ſays my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> this had no Influence over the King, and only irritated <hi>Cecyll</hi> the more againſt <hi>Ralegh.</hi>

But, finding him a martial Man, addicted to foreign Affairs and great Actions, he feared left he ſhould engage him in a War.</hi> That <hi>Ralegh</hi> was in Company with the King; and that ſome of his Converſation turned upon this Subject we have from his own Words, where he ſays, <hi>I offer'd his Majeſty, at my Uncle</hi> Carew's, <hi>to carry</hi> 2000 <hi>Men to invade the</hi> Spaniards <hi>without the King's Charge.</hi> And this agrees with his writing a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which he did or intended to deliver to his Majeſty <hi>againſt the Peace with</hi> Spain now in Treaty, which ſeems to be the ſame that was 100 Years afterwards publiſh'd by his Grandſon.

But, if Reaſon would have prevail'd, it was not wanting alſo from other Hands; ſo that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was not ſingular in his Diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the King, but had the Satisfaction of ſeeing Foreigners, as well as his own Countrymen, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his Senitments; and the Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> tho' otherwiſe brought into the Court-Meaſures, yet could not, it ſeems, conſent to theſe of a general Pacification; therefore was, as well as <hi>Ralegh,</hi> excluded from the Benefit of thoſe rich Preſents, which the Marquis of <hi>Roſny,</hi> Ambaſſador from <hi>France,</hi> made to all thoſe Courtiers who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the ſame; inſomuch that <hi>Howard,</hi> being aſk'd by the King, <hi>How it happen'd he had not a Jewel as well as the reſt?</hi> Anſwer'd, in Alluſion to <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Fable, <hi>Non ſum</hi> Gallus, <hi>itaque non reperi</hi> Gemmam.

Oppoſition of it, and the Conſequences of that, ſeem to have been the Hinges upon which his whole Fortune now turn'd; I ſay, the moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cauſe to me of all thoſe Sorrows and Sufferings which fill up the melancholy Remains of his Story. This unfortunate Event, which he was above ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by trimming and temporiſing in a Matter which he knew ſo highly concern'd the Honour and Advantage of his Country, he has himſelf ſo excellently accounted for, where he ſhews the ill Succeſs which attends ſuch ſincere Conduct, and how Proſperity is the Fruit of ſlaviſh or hypocritical Compliances; <note n="*" place="bottom">In a curious Diſcourſe, where he Learnedly and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reconciles Fortune with Reaſon and Providence, <hi>Ralegh</hi> has theſe Words. "But may it be objected, that, if <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> were not ſometimes the Cauſes of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> in Men, but an idle Voice whereby we expreſs <hi>Succeſs,</hi> how comes it then, that ſo many worthy and wiſe Men depend upon ſo many unworthy and empty-headed Fools? That Riches and Honour are given to external Men, and without Kernel; and ſo many Learned, Virtuous and Valiant Men, wear out their Lives in poor and dejected Eſtates? In a Word, there is no other inferior or apparent Cauſe, beſides the Partiality of Men's Affection, but <hi>the Faſhioning and not Faſhioning ourſelves according to the Nature of the Times wherein we live.</hi> For whoſoever is moſt able, and beſt ſufficient to diſcern, and has withal an honeſt and open Heart, and loving Truth; if Princes, or thoſe who Govern, endure no other Diſcourſe than their own Flatteries; then, I ſay, ſuch a one, whoſe Virtue and Courage forbids him to be baſe, and a Diſſembler, ſhall evermore hang under the Wheel; which kind of deſerving well, and receiving ill, we always falſely charge Fortune withal: For whoſoever ſhall tell any Great Man, or Magiſtrate, that he is not Juſt; the General of an Army, that he is not Valiant; and great Ladies, that they are not Fair; ſhall never be made a Counſellor, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or a Courtier. Neither is it ſufficient to be Wiſe with a Wiſe Prince, Valiant with a Valiant, and Juſt with him that is Juſt, for ſuch a one has no Eſtate in his Proſperity; but he muſt alſo <hi>change with the Succeſſor,</hi> if he be of <hi>contrary Qualities;</hi> ſail with the Tide of the Time, and alter Form and Condition, as the State or States-maſter changes: Otherwiſe, how were it poſſible that the moſt baſe Men, and ſeparate from all imitable Qualities, could ſo often attain to Honour and Riches, but by ſuch an obſervant ſlaviſh Courſe?" A little further, having quoted out of <hi>Menander,</hi> "That every Fool is won with his own Pride, and the flattering Applauſe of others; he infers, That whoſoever will live altogether out of himſelf, ſtudy other Men's Humours, and obſerve them, ſhall never be Unfortunate. On the contrary, that Man, who prizes Truth and Virtue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Seaſon wherein he lives be of theſe, and all Sorts of Goodneſs, Fruitful, ſhall never proſper by the Poſſeſſion or Profeſſion thereof." So, after other learned Authorities and proper Examples, concludes with the following ingenious Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, "Whoſoever therefore will ſet before him <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s two <hi>Marks</hi> to ſhoot at, <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> muſt ſet on and take off, a back of Iron to a weak Wooden Bow, that he may fit both the Strong and the Feeble. For as he, who firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to add Sails to rowing Veſſels, did either ſo proportion them, as being faſtened aloft, and towards the Head of his Maſt, he might abide all Winds and Storms, or elſe he ſome Time or other periſh'd by his own Invention: So that Man, who prizes Virtue for itſelf, and cannot endure to hoiſt and ſtrike Sail, as the divers Natures of Calms and Storms require, muſt cut his Sails and his Cloth of mean Length and Breadth, and content himſelf with a ſlow and ſure Navigation; to wit, a mean and free Eſtate."

Thus have we ſeen ſeveral Circumſtances, and theſe are all I have met with in this Interval, whereby <hi>Ralegh</hi> might undeſignedly, and unluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily become diſagreeable to a Man of King <hi>James</hi>'s Temper; but, on the other ſide, little or nothing that could ſo inflame <hi>Ralegh</hi> againſt the King, as to make him run headlong into ſuch violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, as could only end in his own Ruin. Suppoſe the King did diſcourage <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him at his Entrance, diſlike his Patent for Wines, or removed him from the Guards, to oblige Sir <hi>Thomas Erſkine,</hi> his Countryman and Favourite, whom he afterwards prefer'd to higher Dignities; and this is all I have met with that could give Offence on the King's part: will this be thought ſufficient Provocation for a Man of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Reaſon and Judgment, ſo tender of Fame and Reputation, ſo ſettled in Family, ſo well ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in his Fortune, no leſs than 3000<hi>l.</hi> a Year, as was confeſs'd at his Trial, beſides many other profitable, and I may ſay princely Poſſeſſions on the Seas, as well as the Land, to plot Commotions or Inſurrections; yet enervate himſelf for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, by reſigning, as he ſays himſelf he did, his Office of chiefeſt Power, the Wardſhip of the <hi>Stannaries?</hi> Nay, further, to herd with a motley and disjointed Crew of Prieſts, alſo with profeſs'd Enemies to himſelf, not to mention Knaves and Fools; and, on a ſudden, reſolve to turn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0181500200:337"/>
to murder the King with his own Hand, and all his innocent Progeny! for this is the Charge that the fertile Pens of <hi>French</hi> Writers have heap'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Indeed, I was ſomewhat ſtartled, when I read it in a Hiſtory that bears the Name and Character of <hi>Thuanus,</hi> though I thought he might poſſibly come at it by miniſterial Direction to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reſident, till at laſt I found his Author to be no other than one of his own Countrymen, whom <hi>Camden,</hi> as I have before obſerv'd, has refuted in other Paſſages that are even more credible. Now theſe tell over this deſperate Story thus. In the Month of <hi>June</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh, a Man equally dexterous at Conſultation or Action,</hi> ſays Thuanus, <hi>and famous for his memorable Expeditions to the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, taking Leave of his Siſter at <hi>London,</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to commend him to God in her Prayers, for he was going to a Place from whence he expected never to return. She, ſuſpecting that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight a Duel, with the ſame Levity diſperſed it among the Ladies of her Acquaintance, 'till the Rumour came to Court. Then <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Friends and Relations flocked about him to know this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe; he, apprehending himſelf detected, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily made a whole Confeſſion and Diſcovery of the Matter. The King was informed, and greatly aſtoniſhed, but would needs have <hi>Ralegh</hi> before him, who, then aſking his Pardon, acknowledg'd, that ſeeing his Majeſty give more Countenance to the <hi>Scots</hi> than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and had deprived him of his Command in the Guards, and that many great Men expected, when he was eſtabliſhed on the Throne, he would be revenged for the Death of his Mother, he had therefore entered into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy with others, whom he named, to ſhed his Royal Blood; and that they had unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted him to be his Majeſty's Executioner, when
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0181500200:338"/>
he rode a hunting. Hereupon the ſaid Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were taken up and tried, as theſe Authors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to relate. If there had been any Truth in this ridiculous Story, which I think no one before has taken the Pains to relate in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that Confeſſion had neither eſcaped the Attorney General <hi>Coke</hi> at <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Trial, when they were ſo lamely put to it to bring him in guilty without ſufficient Proof, nor King <hi>James</hi>'sapologetical Declaration after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death, in which his Majeſty and his Council toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have no leſs lamely offered weaker Reaſons for taking away his Life, as will be fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in its proper Place.</p>
            <p>By our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Accounts it appears there was ſomewhat of a Plot, but it was never proved that <hi>Ralegh</hi> was engaged in it; however, his great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the Attorney-general <hi>Coke,</hi> affected to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him with the Conſpirators, <hi>to</hi> Sampſon<hi>'s Foxes, which were joined in the Tails, though their Heads were ſevered.</hi> What Share he had in that Plot may further be judged by the Promotions which the Conſpirators intended themſelves upon the Succeſs of it; for whereas one was to be Lord-chancellor, another Lord-marſhal, this Lord-treaſurer, that Maſter of the Horſe, and t'other Secretary of State: how comes it, as one Author well obſerves, that <hi>Ralegh,</hi> able to officiate any, had no Office in the State aſſign'd him? But perhaps the beſt Means to clear him, may be the very <hi>Trial</hi> by which he was condemn'd. 'Tis too common, and too tedious, to be thought needful of tranſcribing it here at length; not to ſay ſo full of barbarous Partiality and foul Language, eſpecially by <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf, that he was expoſed for it upon the publick Theatre; and thoſe, who revere the Laws of our Country, have been ſo aſhamed of it, as rather to wiſh the Proceedings have been falſely related, than believe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0181500200:339"/>
ſuch a Sentence could paſs upon ſuch inſufficient Evidence. But the Character of this <hi>Trial,</hi> and of that <hi>Attorney General,</hi> I leave to others; and ſhall here only, from the ſeveral Copies or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of it I have met with, draw out a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Narrative of the moſt material Matters of Fact, wherein <hi>Ralegh</hi> appears any way concern'd; and it is as follows:</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Matthew de Laurencie,</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> Attendant on Count <hi>Aremberg,</hi> who now, about the Beginning of <hi>June,</hi> came over Ambaſſador-extraordinary from <hi>Albert,</hi> Arch-duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to congratulate King <hi>James,</hi> and aſſiſt in compoſing the General Peace. With this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had held Intelligence ſome Years before, upon Matters of State, with Licence. Five Days after <hi>Aremberg</hi>'s Arrival, that is to ſay, about the 9th of the ſame Month, <hi>Cobham</hi> repair'd to him with <hi>Laurencie,</hi> and that Night <hi>Cobham</hi> ſupp'd, with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> at <hi>Durham-houſe</hi> in the <hi>Strand;</hi> whereby <hi>Ralegh</hi> came to underſtand, that <hi>Cobham</hi> had freſh Negociations with <hi>Aremberg;</hi> and was, as the chief of thoſe who refuſed the Peace, offered a Sum of Money by <hi>Cobham</hi> to be a Promoter of it; tho' that Offer, alſo made to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> before <hi>Aremberg</hi> came, was afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as will appear, to have been for treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Purpoſes. In the next Month, thoſe Perſons with whom <hi>Cobham</hi> tranſacted the Conſpiracy (or part of it) then on foot, were diſcover'd; either by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction in revenge to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> the greateſt Enemy of <hi>Spain</hi> alive, thinking he was then too far hamper'd in, or acquainted with it to eſcape; or by ſome one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſecure himſelf: And, when the Lord <hi>Cecyll</hi> (for he was lately made Baron of <hi>Eſſenden)</hi> found, upon the firſt News of <hi>Anthony Copley,</hi> one of theſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0181500200:340"/>
Conſpirators, who was apprehended the 6th of <hi>July,</hi> that the King's Perſon was to be ſurpriz'd by the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> and <hi>George Brook,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> he ſuſpected <hi>Cobham</hi> himſelf was in the Secret; and <hi>Cobham</hi>'s great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with <hi>Ralegh</hi> at this Time, who was now buying an Eſtate for him, and ſettling his Houſhold Affairs, drew <hi>Ralegh</hi> alſo into Suſpicion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Cecyll,</hi> meeting <hi>Ralegh</hi> upon <hi>Windſor</hi> Terrace, tells him, <hi>the Lords of the Council had ſomething to ſay to him:</hi> ſo he was examined about the ſurpriſing Treaſon, and particularly about <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as appears from his own Words, whom he fully cleared. After Examination, <hi>Ralegh</hi> further ſaid: <hi>Whatſoever Correſpondence there was between</hi> Cobham <hi>and</hi> Aremberg, Laurencie <hi>might be better able to give Account of it, therefore adviſed to the calling upon him;</hi> though, as he further explained, <hi>he knew of no Intelligence between them, but ſuch as might be warranted:</hi> And that Advice he wrote alſo in a Letter to <hi>Cecyll.</hi> When <hi>Ralegh</hi> returned from Examination a private Priſoner to his own Houſe, <hi>Cobham</hi> ſent him to know what had paſs'd; <hi>Ralegh</hi> writ an Anſwer by Capt. <hi>Feymis, that he was examin'd, and had clear'd him of all;</hi> and <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> bid <hi>Cobham be of good Comfort, for one Witneſs could not condemn him:</hi> This Precaution, to arm <hi>Cobham</hi> againſt making Diſcoveries, was, after his Confeſſion of it, objected againſt <hi>Ralegh;</hi> but he utterly deny'd, that he ſent any ſuch verbal Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Now when <hi>Cobham</hi> was brought to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination at <hi>Richmond,</hi> one Date whereof appears to have been <hi>July</hi> 18; and after he had, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Denial, cleared both himſelf and <hi>Ralegh</hi> of all that was queſtion'd againſt them, <hi>Cobham</hi> was, by Device, ſays my Author (in an Epiſtolary Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of his Trial, at which he was preſent) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0181500200:341"/>
to think, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had firſt impeach'd and betray'd him. For that Part of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aforeſaid to <hi>Cecyll,</hi> referring the Lords to <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie</hi> for <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Tranſactions with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> being ſhewed to <hi>Cobham,</hi> and accompanied, it ſeems, with ſuch artful Suggeſtions as were proper to inflame a Man of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Weakneſs, had the deſired Effect; for he being led thereby to imagine that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had accus'd him of all, or more than he knew, burſt out into vehement Exclamations againſt <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and in his Rage, or Madneſs, made the following Confeſſion. <hi>That having a Paſſport to go to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>King, he intended firſt to confer with the Archduke; and, becauſe he knew he had not Money to pay his own Army, meant from thence to go to</hi> Spain, <hi>to deal with the King for</hi> 600,0000 <hi>Crowns, then to return by</hi> Jerſey; <hi>and that nothing ſhould be done about the Diſtribution of that Money to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented in</hi> England, <hi>till he had ſpoken with Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh: <hi>Further, that he had never enter'd into theſe Courſes, but by his Inſtigation. He ſpake alſo of Plots, but of the Particulars could give no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; yet acknowledg'd he was afraid that</hi> Ralegh, <hi>upon his Return to</hi> Jerſey, <hi>would have him and the Money to the King.</hi> After all this, before <hi>Cobham</hi> departed to the Stair-foot, he retracted his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and profeſs'd he had done <hi>Ralegh</hi> wrong: Nor does it appear, ſays my Author, that he did ſubſcribe it. In another Branch of his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaid he had of <hi>Ralegh</hi> a Book, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt the King's Title, which he gave to his Brother <hi>Brook,</hi> and that <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid it was fooliſhly written. But this he alſo retracted, as we ſhall hear. Upon this, and other Parts of his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more foreign to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> concerning the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Lady <hi>Arabella Stuart</hi> to the Crown, as alſo from that of <hi>George Brook,</hi> a known Enemy
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0181500200:342"/>
to <hi>Ralegh,</hi> as <hi>Cecyll</hi> could not deny; <hi>aſſerting his Brother</hi> Cobham <hi>told him (tho'</hi> Cobham, <hi>in his Confeſſion, refuſed to own it) the Lord</hi> Grey <hi>and others were only on the</hi> bye, <hi>but he and</hi> Ralegh <hi>were on the</hi> main; <hi>thereby meaning, ſaid</hi> Brook, <hi>the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the King and his Iſſue;</hi> together with what <hi>Ralegh</hi> acknowledg'd in his own Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>That</hi> Cobham <hi>offer'd him</hi> 8000 <hi>Crowns for his Furtherance of the Peace, tho' the Lord</hi> Cecyll <hi>and Earl of</hi> Northumberland <hi>were to have the ſame Proffers;</hi> and that in ſome Diſcourſes he might have ſaid, <hi>the Way to invade</hi> England <hi>was to begin with Stirs in</hi> Scotland: Upon theſe Circumſtances, I ſay, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was indicted at <hi>Stanes</hi> on the 21ſt of <hi>September</hi> following; and from hence that heavy Indictment appears to have been accumulated upon him, which we ſee prefixed to his Trial. Three Days afterwards <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Grey</hi> were alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted at the ſame Place; and, not long after this, they were all three return'd Priſoners to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> When the Time of their Trial drew nigh, that is to ſay in the Beginning of <hi>November, Ralegh</hi> got a poor Fellow in the Tower to caſt up a Letter, faſten'd to an Apple, in at <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Window, while the Lieutenant was at Supper, to intreat him (becauſe he then knew not but <hi>Cobham</hi> might be arraign'd before him:) <hi>for God's ſake, to do him Juſtice by his Anſwer, and ſignify to him, that he had wronged him in his Accuſation;</hi> and <hi>Cobham</hi> did, by an Anſwer under his Hand, confeſs the ſame; which not being perhaps ſo full and expreſſive as <hi>Ralegh</hi> expected, he afterwards ſent <hi>Cobham</hi> another Letter, deſiring he would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Innocence at his Arraignment. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that <hi>Ralegh</hi> did not now requeſt any further Juſtification under his Hand, <hi>Cobham</hi> ſent him another Anſwer, clearing him in the moſt
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0181500200:343"/>
ſolemn and perfect Manner, as will preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Now by Reaſon of the Plague, which raged ſo violently in and about <hi>London,</hi> the Term having been proclaim'd to be held at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the State Priſoners, who were thus indicted for the Plot, were conveyed thither in great Pomp. I find, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> went in his own Coach, under the Cuſtody of Sir <hi>Robert Manſell,</hi> on the 10th of <hi>November,</hi> to <hi>Bagſhot</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> twenty four Miles from <hi>London;</hi> and, two Days after, from thence, the other thirty Miles, to the Caſtle at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The Conſpirators conducted thither at the ſame Time, were <hi>George Brook,</hi> under the Charge of Sir <hi>William Wade;</hi> Sir <hi>Griffin Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> under Sir <hi>Robert Worth;</hi> beſides Sir <hi>Edward Parham, Bartholomew Brookſhy, Anthony Copley;</hi> alſo <hi>William Watſon</hi> and <hi>William Clark,</hi> two Prieſts, Under-wardens of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the Keeper of the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> together with a Guard of fifty Light Horſe: As for <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Grey,</hi> they ſet out ſix Days, and arrived three Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the ſaid Caſtle, under the like Guard.</p>
            <p>And here <hi>Cobham</hi> having been prevailed on to make freſh Accuſations in a Letter to the Lords, at leaſt ſubſcrib'd with his Name, which will be produced a little further, <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Trial was firſt brought on; and this was on the 17th of the Month aforeſaid. He excepted not againſt his Jury, being all Strangers: But we are told by one, who ſeems to have had good Intelligence of this Matter, <hi>That there was appointed for</hi> Ralegh <hi>another Jury, the Foreman of which was Sir</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Stanhope, <hi>the next Sir</hi> Edward Darcy, <hi>the next Sir</hi> William Killegrew, <hi>all Men of Honour, and near Servants to the late Queen</hi> Elizabeth: <hi>But theſe being found not for their Turn, they were all changed over Night, and thoſe others (named in</hi>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0181500200:344"/>
               <hi>the common Printed Trial) put in their Places.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Indictment had been opened, and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Serjeant <hi>Heath</hi> and Attorney <hi>Coke,</hi> in Speeches, manifeſtly fathering the Treaſons of the Reſt upon <hi>Ralegh,</hi> for no other Reaſon that I can ſee, but becauſe <hi>he was a Man of Wit, and a Swordſman: Cobham</hi>'s Examination was read as before quoted. Here <hi>Ralegh</hi> firſt ſhewed the Unreaſonableneſs and Improbability of the Accuſation therein againſt him, as follows: <hi>It is ſtrange for me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to deviſe with</hi> Cobham, <hi>that he ſhould go to</hi> Spain <hi>to perſuade the King to diſburſe ſo much Money, he being a Man of no Love in</hi> England; <hi>and I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſigned my Room of chiefeſt Command, the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſhip of the</hi> Stannaries; <hi>it is ſtrange for me to make myſelf a</hi> Robin Hood, <hi>or a</hi> Ket, <hi>or a</hi> Cade, <hi>I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> England <hi>to be in a better State than ever it was. I knew</hi> Scotland <hi>united,</hi> Ireland <hi>quieted,</hi> Denmark <hi>aſſured, which before was ſuſpected. I knew, that having a Lady, whom Time had ſurpriſed, we had now a lawful Succeſſor. The State of</hi> Spain <hi>was not unknown to me. I had written a Diſcourſe, which I intended to preſent unto the King againſt the Peace with</hi> Spain. <hi>I knew the</hi> Spaniard <hi>had ſix Repulſes, three in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and three at Sea; and once in</hi> 1588, <hi>by my Lord-admiral, alſo at</hi> Cadiz. <hi>I knew he was diſcouraged and diſhonoured. I knew the King of</hi> Spain <hi>to be the proudeſt Prince living, but now he comes creeping to my Maſter for a Peace. I knew, whereas he had before in his Ports ſix or ſeven Score Sail of Ships, he has now but ſix or ſeven. I knew, of twenty-five Millions he had from his</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>he has ſcarce one left. I knew him ſo poor, that the Jeſuits in</hi> Spain <hi>were fain to beg at the Church-door. Was it ever read or heard, that any Prince ſhould diſburſe ſo much Money, without a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Pawn? I knew her own Subjects, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:0181500200:345"/>
               <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>would not lend her Majeſty Money, without Lands in Mortgage. I knew the Queen did not lend the States Money, without</hi> Fluſhing, Brill, <hi>and other Towns, for a Pawn; and can it be thought he would let</hi> Cobham <hi>have ſo great a Sum? I never came to the Lord</hi> Cobham<hi>'s but about Matters of his Profit, as the ordering of his Houſe; and I had of his, when I was examined, four thouſand Pounds worth of Jewels for a Purchaſe, a Pearl of three thouſand Pounds, and a Ring worth five hundred Pounds. If he had had a Fancy to run away, he would not have left ſo much Money to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a Leaſe in Fee-farm. I ſaw him buy three hundred Pounds worth of Books to ſend to his Library at</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and a Cabinet of three hundred Pounds to give Mr.</hi> Attorney <hi>for drawing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances; and God in Heaven knows, not I, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he intended to travel: But for the Practice with</hi> Arabella, <hi>or Letters to</hi> Aremberg, <hi>or any Diſcourſe with him, or in what Language he ſpake unto him; if I knew any of theſe Things, I would abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Indictment, and acknowledge myſelf worthy of a thouſand Deaths.</hi> And a little further concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Examination: <hi>He that hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, has ever been aſked if it be according to his Meaning, and then to ſubſcribe. Methinks, my Lords, when he accuſes a Man, he ſhould give ſome Account and Reaſon of it; it is not ſufficient to ſay we talked of it. If I had been the Plotter, would not I have given</hi> Cobham <hi>ſome Arguments, whereby to perſuade the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and anſwer his Objections? I knew</hi> Weſtmoreland <hi>and</hi> Bothwell, <hi>Men of other Underſtandings than</hi> Cobham, <hi>were ready to beg their Bread.</hi> Here being obſtructed by other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Attorney fell at laſt into that Paſſage of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s telling <hi>Brook, You are on the Bye,</hi> Ralegh <hi>and I are on the Main.</hi> But <hi>Cobham</hi> would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0181500200:346"/>
his ever having ſaid ſuch Words. <hi>Brook,</hi> who had pretended he did ſay them, was allowed to have been <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Enemy; ſo the Expreſſion was not proved. Another Matter they kept ſome Coil about was, the Book <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaid he had of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> written againſt the King's Title. This was nothing more than a <hi>Defence of the Queen's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of</hi> Scotland, written by one <hi>Robert Snag,</hi> a Lawyer, and found by <hi>Ralegh</hi> in the Library of the late Lord-treaſurer <hi>Burghley,</hi> which he had Liberty of ſearching for ſome geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical Deſcriptions of the <hi>Weſt-Indies. Ralegh</hi> had declared to <hi>Cobham</hi> that it was fooliſhly written, but denied that he gave it him; and though <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in his Examination, ſaid it was given him by <hi>Ralegh,</hi> he revoked that Confeſſion upon being further queſtioned about it (as one of the Lords of the Council own'd;) and ſaid, the Truth was, <hi>he took the ſame of himſelf out of Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh's <hi>Study when he was aſleep;</hi> ſo much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on were Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Accuſations. But there was nothing acted thereby to the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, for the Book was burnt. As for the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Rumour in <hi>Liſbon,</hi> brought into Court by one <hi>Dyer,</hi> a Pilot, who anſwering to a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>when the King would be crowned?</hi> made by ſomebody or other there, that <hi>he hoped 'twould be ſhortly;</hi> was told again, <hi>it ſhould never be, for Don</hi> Ralegh <hi>and Don</hi> Cobham <hi>would cut his Throat firſt: Ralegh</hi> made light of it, as of ſuch a Rumour and ſuch a Witneſs he might; and ſaid, <hi>If</hi> Cobham <hi>had Practice with</hi> Aremberg, <hi>it might well be known abroad: And that the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>was named with</hi> Jack Straw<hi>'s Treaſon to countenance it.</hi> But none of theſe little Circumſtances were much inſiſted on; and we are told by one who was preſent, that, <hi>touching the ſetting up of</hi> Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0181500200:347"/>
               <hi>nothing at all was proved; nor touching the Invaſion here, or Sedition in</hi> Scotland, <hi>or even the Deſtruction of the King, &amp;c. The Proof againſt</hi> Ralegh <hi>(as the ſame Writer continues a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) did reſt only upon</hi> Cobham<hi>'s Accuſation, and ſome Preſumptions, whereof that only was the Ground; therefore</hi> Ralegh <hi>ſpent moſt of the Time in diſabling that Accuſation, as being only utter'd in Fury and Paſſion;</hi> through the Device aforeſaid, of making <hi>Cobham</hi> believe that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had firſt accuſed him. Beſides, that he had renounced and repented it; and altho' <hi>afterwards by Practice, ſays my ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, he did affirm it, yet would he never be brought to ſet his Hand to the Examination; all which was clear.</hi> Then <hi>Ralegh,</hi> ſeeing this Retraction ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly overlook'd, <hi>laboured to prove theſe two Points out of Scripture, Civil Law, Statute Law, Common Law and Conſcience; in every of which he had been plentifully read (as the ſame Auditor of his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment goes on) firſt, that there ought to be produced againſt him two Witneſſes; ſecondly, that his Accuſer might be brought to accuſe him Face to Face.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here to are <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s own Words, after he had urged the Statutes of <hi>Edward</hi> III. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> produced the Opinions of Judges in the Law, and Precedents from their Writings; beſides Teſtimonies from the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where he ſays, <hi>If by the Statute, Civil Law, and God's Word, it be requir'd that there muſt be two Witneſſes at leaſt, hear with me, if I deſire but one.</hi> But truly it was an unreaſonable Requeſt; thoſe Statutes were repeal'd, and the Law would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it now; tho' we are informed that King <hi>James</hi> himſelf, taking Notice how <hi>Cobham</hi> was with-held, ſhould ſay, <hi>If he could have ſpoken any Thing againſt</hi> Ralegh, <hi>they would have brought him from</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>to have accuſed him.</hi> Well
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0181500200:348"/>
therefore might he deſire the Jury to conſider, <hi>There is no Cauſe ſo doubtful, which the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel cannot make good againſt the Law. Theſe Men do uſually defend bad Cauſes every Day againſt Men of their own Profeſſion, and as able as themſelves; if they can do ſo, what may they not do with me, who never ſtudied Law till I came into the Tower of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>who have been practis'd in other Affairs; am weak of Memory, and feeble as you ſee?</hi> (for he was fain to have a Pen and Ink to help him in the long Speeches that were made againſt him.)

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0181500200:349"/>
mentioned, written to the Lords at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> the Day before the Trial. Some ſay, this Letter was not written by <hi>Cobham</hi> himſelf; but that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Wade,</hi> one of <hi>Cecyll</hi>'s Creatures, tampering with his Weakneſs, got <hi>Cobham</hi> to write his Name to a Blank; to which, ſays my Author, <hi>Wade</hi> no queſtion wrote the Accuſation. Others imply, that <hi>Cobham</hi> did himſelf write it; tho' after he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by a Letter from his Lady, that there was no Way to ſave his own Life, but to accuſe <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh;</hi> and that it was ſo reported upon the going together of the Jury. This Letter was read with great Triumph and Exultation by <hi>Coke,</hi> as follows. <hi>I have thought it fit to ſet down this to my Lords, wherein I profeſs on my Soul to write nothing but the Truth. I am come now near to the Period of my Time; therefore I confeſs the Truth before God and his Angels.</hi> Ralegh, <hi>four Days before I came from the</hi> Tower, <hi>cauſed an Apple to be thrown in at my Chamber-window; the Effect of it was, to intreat me to right the Wrong I had done him, in ſaying that I would come home by</hi> Jerſey; <hi>which under my Hand to him I have retracted. His firſt Letter was thrown in the ſame Manner, wherein he prayed me to write him a Letter, which I did. He ſent me Word the Judges met at Mr.</hi> Attorney<hi>'s Houſe; and that there was good Hope the Proceedings againſt us ſhould be ſtaid; he ſent me another Time a little Tobacco. At</hi> Aremberg<hi>'s coming,</hi> Ralegh <hi>dealt with me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him a Penſion of fiſteen hundred Pounds a Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which he promiſed, that no Action ſhould be againſt</hi> Spain, <hi>but he would give Knowledge before-hand. He told me the States had Audience with the King. He hath been the original Cauſe of my Ruin; for I had no Dealing with</hi> Aremberg, <hi>but by his Inſtigation. He hath been the Cauſe of my Diſcontentment; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me not to be overtaken with Preachers, as</hi> Eſſex

               <hi>was; and that the King would better allow of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Denial, than to accuſe any.</hi> But this Advice to a Denial, and by that Example, and the Deſire of any ſuch Penſion from <hi>Spain, Ralegh</hi> proteſted to be falſe. And further, to ſhew them what a baſe diſhonourable Recreant <hi>Cobham</hi> was, he pull'd out the Letter which <hi>Cobham</hi> a few Days before wrote to him voluntarily in the <hi>Tower,</hi> deſiring the Lord <hi>Cecyll</hi> to read it, becauſe he knew his Hand; and that the Jury would obſerve, if <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony were of any Credit with them, how much more ſolemnly it was writ to clear, than the other to condemn him; being in theſe Words, <hi>Seeing myſelf ſo near my End; for the Diſcharge of my own Conſcience, and freeing myſelf from your Blood, which elſe will cry Vengeance againſt me: I proteſt,</hi> upon my Salvation, I never practis'd with <hi>Spain</hi> by your Procurement; God ſo comfort me in this my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as you are a true Subject for any Thing that I know. I will ſay with <hi>Daniel,</hi> Purus ſum à ſanguine hujus: <hi>So God have Mercy on my Soul, as I know no Treaſon by you.</hi> This was the laſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given; yet the Jury brought in their Verdict guilty: This Letter, laſt produced to acquit <hi>Ralegh,</hi> not prevailing with them ſo much, it ſeems, as the Letter before, which was laſt, tho' leſs forcibly, written by <hi>Cobham</hi> to accuſe him; <hi>which, all Things conſidered, ſays the Perſon, who heard the whole Trial,</hi> was no more to be weigh'd than the Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Dog; and I would not <hi>(continues he)</hi> for much, to have been of the Jury, to have found him guilty. <hi>Some of his Jury, we are further told, were after he was caſt, ſo far touch'd in Conſcience, as to demand of him Pardon on their Knees; and even</hi> Coke <hi>the Attorney himſelf, being retired into a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to take ſome Air, when his Man brought him Word that the Jury had condemn'd</hi> Ralegh <hi>of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>

               <hi>anſwered, Surely thou art miſtaken, for I myſelf accuſed him but of Miſpriſion of Treaſon; and this Relation, upon the Word of a Chriſtian, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſays my Author, from Sir</hi> Edward Coke's <hi>own Mouth.</hi> Sentence being given, <hi>Ralegh</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſired, the King might know the Proofs againſt him; that he ſtill perſiſted in his Loyalty, notwithſtanding that Verdict; which he would pray, that his ſaid Jury might never anſwer for: and only craved Pardon for concealing Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Offer to him, which he did through a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that he had diverted him from thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. So accompanied the Sheriff to the Priſon <hi>with admirable Erection, yet in ſuch Sort as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Man ſhould do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was he <hi>tired out of his Life, as one obſerves, by the Bawling of the King's Counſel on one Side, and the Bench's inſiſting on a Confeſſion, extorted from the Lord</hi> Cobham <hi>out of Fear, on the other, rather than convinced:</hi> And thus did his Adverſaries reap Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and Reproach in their Victory, while he received triumphant Applauſes in his Overthrow, like ſome Flowers which are ſweeter in their Fall, than others in their Bloom. He ſtood at a Bay with them from Morning 'till Night, <hi>to the great Admiration of the Hearers, who all thought that a Man of ſuch Underſtanding and Experience, would hardly be drawn into a Plot ſo ſoul and ſo fooliſh. Divers, who went thither his Enemies, went away with Commiſeration of his Injuries and Misfortunes, thinking never Man ſpake better for himſelf.</hi> One of his Auditors ſays, <hi>He behaved himſelf ſo worthily, ſo wiſely, ſo temperately, that in half a Day the Mind of all the Company was changed, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt Fate, to the extremeſt Pity:</hi> And another ſays, That <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh<hi>'s Carriage was moſt remarkable; firſt, to the Lords; humble, yet not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;</hi>

               <hi>Towards the Jury; affable, but not fawning; rather ſhewing Love of Life, than Fear of Death: Towards the King's Counſel; patient, but not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neglecting; not yielding to Imputations laid againſt him in Words: And it was wondered, that a Man of his heroic Spirit, could be ſo valiant in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; that he was never overtaken in Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. On the other Side, as to <hi>Coke</hi>'s Behaviour, we ſhall, to what has been ſaid, only obſerve, as one Means to account for it, that it <hi>Eſſex</hi> was known to have ever been in any wiſe a Friend or Patron to him, as it appears he was in a private Memorial of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſon, who was of the ſame College in <hi>Oxford</hi> with <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and almoſt of the ſame ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then <hi>Coke</hi> might perhaps think of retrieving himſelf in the Eye of the World, and making Atonement for his <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to the ſaid Earl, alſo at his Trial, and to his Memory after his Death, by his Inhumanity now to one of the contrary Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Cecyll,</hi> on the other Side, play'd a ſmooth Edge upon <hi>Ralegh</hi> throughout the Trial; his Blade ſeemed ever anointed with the Balſam of Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Apology, whereby he gave not ſuch rough and ſmarting Wounds, though they were as deep and fatal as the other. But <hi>Ralegh</hi> could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh crooked Friendſhip, and perhaps the Grounds of it, in this Place, as well as he has done crooked Wiſdom in another; when, to thoſe Speeches, where <hi>Cecyll</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Affection, to you Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>was not extinguiſh'd, but ſlaked, in Regard of your Deſerts: and, excepting your Faults (I call them no worſe) by God I am your Friend:</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Whoever is the Workman, it is Reaſon he ſhould give Account of his Work to the Workmaſter.</hi> As to any Impertinences that occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Trial, they appear no where ſo much as in the perſonal Reflections made by the ſaid Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

               <hi>Coke,</hi> and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Popham,</hi> whom <hi>Camden</hi> juſtly calls a cenſorious Man; they being foreign to the Matters <hi>Ralegh</hi> was charged with, therefore he wiſely looked over them. But theſe, and the other Irregularities throughout the whole Proceedings, which have left Men ſo unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Juſtice of them againſt Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> and ſo little inclined to believe him the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal his Enemies made him, being ſummed up by an able Hand, and one whoſe Province it more properly was to judge of them, I ſhall take my Leave of the ſaid Trial, with a Reference to his Obſervations on it <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>John Hawles,</hi> Sollicitor General to the late King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> in his Reply to a Sheet of Paper, entitled, The <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>England, vindicated;</hi> Printed in Fol. 1689. having obſerved, that the Accuſations of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> did not amount to a legal Proof; ſays further, p. 35, as follows. "Not to mention all that might be excepted to in the Trial of the Caſe cited; I would know, by what Law is the Depoſition of a Perſon, who might be brought Face to Face to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, read as Evidence? I would know, by what Law it is forbidden, that the Accuſer ſhould be brought Face to Face to the Accuſed? I would know, by what Law <hi>Brook</hi>'s Depoſition of what the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> told him of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> was Evidence againſt <hi>Ralegh?</hi> I would know, by what Law the Story <hi>Dyer</hi> told of what an unknown Man ſaid to him at <hi>Liſbon</hi> of Don <hi>Ralegh,</hi> was Evidence againſt <hi>Ralegh?</hi> I would know, by what Statute, the Statutes of the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> III. and the 5th of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> VI. are repeal'd? This Trial was ſo very irregular throughout, that I would willingly believe it was not ſo as it is related; but, if it were ſo, I am ſure none can defend it: And even for that Reaſon, if any ſuch Reſolution was in the Caſe, as is cited, I am ſure it ought to carry no Credit with it: And there is no Reaſon to believe there was any ſuch Reſolution; there being no Occaſion for it; the Queſtion being only Fact, which Sir <hi>Walter</hi> deny'd. The Circumſtances of his Trial, in which the Court always over-ruled the Priſoner, were ſomewhat like the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s; he complained of the ill Uſage of the King's Counſel, as well as the Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> and both had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to do. Hearſay was admitted to be given in Evidence againſt both; all that either of them ſaid for themſelves, tho' very material, was ſlighted. The one was put in Mind, at his Trial, of the Death of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> as the other was, of the Death of the Viſcount <hi>Stafford;</hi> both in their dying Speeches, vindicated themſelves of thoſe Aſperſions. The principal Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, in both Caſes, had before the Trials, aſfirm'd, they knew nothing againſt them: They were both accuſed with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard what other Perſons had ſaid in their Company, and had not diſcover'd it; they both gave the ſame Anſwer, that they could not help other Men's talk. I think it is plain, at this Day, that of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> is thought a <hi>Sham-plot;</hi> What the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s is thought, let the author ſay."</note>.</p>

               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:0181500200:354"/>
               <hi>That</hi> Ralegh <hi>expected nothing leſs than this Kind of Treatment from thoſe Hands, is plain by the Letter which he wrote to the King himſelf juſt before his Trial; wherein having ſaid,</hi> I know, that, among many Preſumptions gathered againſt me, your Majeſty has been perſuaded, that I was one of thoſe who were greatly diſcontented, and therefore the more likely to prove diſloyal; but the great God of Heaven and Earth diſclaim me from both Worlds, if I were not the contrary, and if I took not great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to behold your Majeſty always learning ſome Good, and bettering my Knowledge by your Majeſty's Diſcourſe: And having humbly beſeeched him not to believe any of thoſe, who, under Pretence of Offences to Kings, do eaſily work their particular Revenge; <hi>he ſays a little further,</hi> For my Part, I proteſt before the ever-living God, that I never intended Treaſon, conſented to Treaſon, or performed Treaſon againſt you; and yet I know I ſhall fall into their Hands, <hi>è quibus non poſſum evadere,</hi> unleſs by your Majeſty's gracious Compaſſion I be ſuſtained. <hi>Another Letter, which he wrote to the Lords, gives us ſome further Light or Aſſurance, that the Offer made to him for one Intention, and to others for another, was conſtrued as made to him for both; where, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the two principal Accuſations againſt him, he ſays,</hi> the firſt was, that Money was offered me
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0181500200:355"/>
with a Pretence to maintain the Amity, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to have aſſiſted his Majeſty's Surpriſe: The other, that I was privy to my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Journey. For the firſt, it ſeems, this Money was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to others long after it was offered to me, and upon other Conſiderations than it was to me. For myſelf I avow, upon my Allegiance, that I never knew or ſuſpected either the Man or the new Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To me it was but once propounded, and in three Weeks after I never heard more of it; neither did I belive that he had any Commiſſion to offer it; for, it that Word Amity had been uſed to me Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourably, I muſt have been alſo made acquainted with the true End for which it ſhould have been given; which it ſeems was for the Surprize: But of any ſuch horrible Purpoſe, if ever I had ſo much as a Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, I refuſe your Lordſhips Favour, and the King's Mercy. I know your Lordſhips have omitted nothing to find out the Truth; but, as you have not err'd, like ill Surgeons, to lay on Plaiſters too narrow for ſo great Wounds, ſo I truſt that you will not imitate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Phyſicians, to give Medicines more cruel than the Diſeaſe itſelf. For the Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> I know I was accuſed to be privy thereto; but I know your Lordſhips have a Reputation of Conſcience, as well as Induſtry. By what means that revengeful Accuſation was ſtirr'd, you, my Lord <hi>Cecyll,</hi> know right well, that it was my Letter about <hi>Keymis;</hi> and your Lordſhips all know whether it be maintain'd, or whether, out of Truth, and out of a Chriſtian Conſideration, it be revoked. <hi>A little further he ſays,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">As the King's Counſel, in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Trial, uſed Arguments, grounded on Preſumptions, to prove him Guilty; ſo did he there alſo uſe others to clear himſelf, grounded on theſe of his great Expences againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and his having always been ſuch a noted Enemy to their Faction. But the Sum of 40,000 <hi>l.</hi> in this Letter above, is only call'd ſo many Crowns in the ſaid common Trial.</note>God knows, and I can give an Account of it,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0181500200:356"/>
that I have ſpent <hi>40000</hi> Pounds of my own againſt that King and Nation; that I never reſerved ſo much of all my Fortunes, as to purchaſe forty Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Land; that I have been a violent Proſecutor and Furtherer of all Enterprizes againſt that Nation: I have ſerved againſt them in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and how, my Lord Admiral and my Lord of <hi>Suffolk</hi> can witneſs. I diſcover'd, myſelf, the richeſt Part of all his <hi>Indies;</hi> I have planted in his Territories. I offer'd his Majeſty at my Uncle <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew</hi>'s, to carry two Thouſand Men to invade him without the King's Charge. Alas! to what End ſhould we live in the World, if all the Endeavours of ſo many Teſtimonies ſhould be blown off with one blaſt of Breath, or be preſented by one Man's Word. Think therefore <hi>(ſays he a little further)</hi> I beſeech you, on my great Affliction with Compaſſion; who loſt my Eſtate, and the King's Favour, upon one Man's Word; and as you would that God ſhould deal with you, deal with me. <hi>He concludes in this Manner,</hi> Your Lordſhips know, that I am guiltleſs of the Surprize intended; you know, or may know that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accepted of the Money, and that it was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me for any ill; and of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Journey, I truſt your Conſciences are reſolved. Keep not then, I beſeech you, theſe my Anſwers and humble Deſires from my Soveraign Lord, <hi>qui eſt rex pius &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricors, &amp; non leo coronatus. In another Letter which he wrote to the King after his Trial, he has theſe Words:</hi> Loſt I am for hearing a vain Man, for hearing only, and never believing or approving; and ſo little Account I made of that Speech of his, which was my Condemnation, that I never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0181500200:357"/>
any ſuch Thing, till it was at my Trial obiected againſt me. <hi>This Letter he nobly concludes, with a Deſire only to</hi> repay <hi>a</hi> lent Life <hi>with a Love and Affection equal to the Goodneſs wherewith his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould pleaſe to beſtow it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe Letters had any good Effect, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not immediately, <hi>Ralegh</hi> being kept near a Month at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> after he was condemned, in daily Expectation of Death. We find, that when the Report of the Arraignments was made to the King in his Privy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>chamber at <hi>Wilton,</hi> he carried himſelf ſo reſervedly, that no Body could gueſs how well he was ſatisfied with the Equality of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, till he made, himſelf, a Difference in the Puniſhment. The two Prieſts were executed on the 29th of <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>George Brook</hi> on the 5th of <hi>December</hi> following. His Majeſty alſo ſign'd Warrants for <hi>Cobham, Grey</hi> and <hi>Markham,</hi> to be beheaded on the 9th Day of the ſaid Month. But, in the particular <hi>Narrative</hi> of this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Execution, <hi>Ralegh</hi> is not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd: and this might be owing to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diſappointment of that Purgation, which was expected from one of thoſe three next to be executed; for the Day aforeſaid being come, <hi>Markham</hi> was firſt brought to the Scaffold; and, having ended his Speech, Prayers, with all he had to ſay, and being on his Knees, ready to receive the Stroke of the Ax, up ſteps <hi>John Gibb,</hi> Groom of the King's Bed-chamber, to Sir <hi>Benjamin Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi> the Sheriff of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> with his Majeſty's Warrant to ſtay the Execution; ſo <hi>Markham</hi> was told he muſt withdraw a while into the Hall, to be confronted by the Lords. Then Lord <hi>Grey</hi> was brought upon the Stage; and he is ſaid to have poured out his Prayers and his Confeſſion, tho' not one Word of them recorded in our Narrative

            <p>But to return to more early Paſſages in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Impriſonment, and to conſider his State, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at his Entrance therein, we may very eaſily believe, he was at firſt in very great Trouble to be ſo ſuddenly, and in ſuch a Manner, depriv'd of Power, Fortune, Liberty and Reputation; but find nothing to confirm the extraordinary Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Writer, deſcribes him under, where he ſays, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'In the publick Joy and Jubilee of the whole Realm, when Favour, Peace and Pardon were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered even to Offenders; he, who in Wit, in Wealth, in Courage, was inferior to few, fell ſuddenly (he cannot tell how) into ſuch a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Deſpair, that his greateſt Enemies would not have wiſhed him ſo much Harm, as he would have done himſelf;'</q> for we have ſeen he had Enemies, who would have done him the Injury that could not

Indeed, the Affairs of a Perſon, who had ſuch various and extenſive Dealings or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Mankind, could not but be ſomewhat perplexed and embarraſs'd, upon a Fall ſo ſudden and precipitous; therefore, to find him employing Agents for collecting in Debts, and ſatisfying Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, is to be expected. Thus, in one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Sir <hi>Michael Hext,</hi> he deſires him to ſpare <hi>John Shellbury</hi> for a little Time, he being bound for him in a Sum of fifteen hundred Pounds; and, if he was reſtrained, ſo that he could not recover the Wine-arrearages, which (as we find from <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Letter before to his Wife) would clear all his Debts, they muſt remain unpaid. The Date en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors'd upon this Letter, probably by Sir <hi>Michael</hi> himſelf, is <hi>November</hi> 12, 1604. In the Middle of <hi>February</hi> following, we find a Grant made by the King, to that <hi>John Shellbury</hi> and another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to this Effect: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> late of <hi>Sherborne,</hi> &amp;c. being attainted of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby all his Goods and Chattels, Real and Perſonal, Moveable and Immoveable; Debts, Duties, Sums of Money, Bonds, &amp;c. are forfeited.

            <p>Thus we ſee a great Diſtinction made already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Cobham,</hi> and ſhall find more Favour extending towards him in a little while.

Here, manifeſtly after the Grant aforeſaid to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Truſtees, becauſe that mentions but one of his Sons, ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of the other, and he was Chriſten'd <hi>Carew,</hi> who was yet born, as Authors compute, within the Year above-mentioned. To this Satisfaction, <hi>Ralegh</hi> had others afterwards, which greatly alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated the loſs of his Liberty; ſo that his reſtraint, which was intended as a Mortification, his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Time ſo converted, that it proved only a Retirement, or the quiet Enjoyment of a domeſtick Life; and he felt certain Comforts ariſe from the conſtant Company of his little Family, which in the Pomp of Courts, the Pride of Conqueſts, the Glory of Diſcoveries, and the Sweetneſs of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom itſelf, he had never taſted.

            <p>But now, or not long after, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was grown into high Eſteem with that great hope and heir of theſe Kingdoms, Prince <hi>Henry Frederick,</hi> the King's eldeſt Son, who, being ſatisfied of his Loyalty, and well inform'd of his great Qualifications and Experience in Civil and Military Affairs, with his hazardous Services for the Honour and Defence of his Country, no leſs than his many publick-ſpirited Adventures, both to enlarge and enrich it, teſtified not his own Merits more in any one particular, than in diſtinguiſhing thoſe of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh;</hi> and, notwithſtanding the many little envious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of ſome undermining Courtiers about him, did both encourage his Epiſtolary Addreſſes to him from the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſend for his Counſel or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon ſeveral emergent Occaſions. It was, perhaps, one of the brighteſt Rays in the ſhining Orb of this rare Prince's Actions; that he never left invading the King with the moſt perſuaſive Solicitations, that he would beſtow <hi>Sherborne</hi> upon him, with full deſign to return it to its juſt Owner, till his Majeſty at laſt granted his Requeſt; but by what cruel Fate <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s hopes were eclipſed again, and indeed thoſe of the whole Kingdom, we ſhall ſuddenly hear.</p>

Such was his Letter touching the Model of a Ship, which the Prince intended to build; and ſuch his Diſcourſe of a Maritimal Voyage, with the Paſſages and Incidents therein, which he ſeconded with ſome neceſſary Obſervations on the Royal Navy and Sea Service, alſo dedicated to his Highneſs; and wherein he appears to have been a moſt worthy and earneſt Counſellor of the Prince, to a due Regard and Regulation thereof. For, ſays <hi>Ralegh</hi> to him, in anſwer to any Objection that might be made to the Maintenance of ſo great a Fleet, in the Perfection and Readineſs which he recommends, now in Times of Peace: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Tho' the Sword is put into the Sheath, we muſt not ſuffer it to ruſt, or ſtick ſo faſt, that we ſhall not be able to draw it readily when needs requires;'</q> and, a little further, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'we may be aſſured, that if thoſe powerful Means, whereby we reduced our Enemies to the Courteſy of ſeeking Peace of us, were neglected, ſo as we could not again, upon Occaſion, readily aſſume the Uſe and Benefit of them, as we have done; thoſe proud maſtering Spirits, finding us at ſuch Advantage, would be more willing to ſhake us by the Ears as Enemies,

What deluded Wretches then have a great part of Mankind been, who have either yielded themſelves to be ſlain in Cauſes, which, if truly known, their Hearts would abhor, or been the bloody Executioners of other Men's Ambition!

However, when a Prince has thereby got Authority, or the ſharpeſt Means in his Power, he would have the mildeſt Uſe; and the one acquired in full Strength, only that the other may be exerciſed with perfect Safety: For he ever preferred Reaſon and Love as ſtronger Chains of Government than Conſtraint or Violence, and thought that royal Dealings was ever ſureſt of meeting with royal Succeſs.

            </p>
            <p>But now <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Pen was engaged upon a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Subject in the Prince's Service, and by his Command; for, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'the firſt Overtures of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between this Prince and the eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Spain</hi> being put off,'</q> the like Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi>was now made by the</hi> Savoyan <hi>Ambaſſador, not only for a Marriage between Prince</hi> Henry <hi>and a Daughter of the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>but for another, of his Son Don</hi> Phillibert, <hi>Prince of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>with Princeſs</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> England. Ralegh <hi>wrote two Diſcourſes, upon this Occaſion, in the Year laſt mentioned; and that he particularly was requeſted by the Prince to give his Opinion of the ſaid Offers, appears in his Introduction to the firſt of thoſe Diſcourſes, inſcribed to ſome Miniſter of State about his Highneſs; in which</hi> Ralegh <hi>has ſo notably diſcovered what a Tool for</hi> Avarice and Ambition moſt of the Catholic Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> had made of this Sacrament of Matrimony; <hi>and how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly</hi> the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> with thoſe of whom theſe Princes are deſcended, have gotten no leſs by the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of their Marriages, than they have done by the Trade of their <hi>Indies; that I wonder theſe excellent political Diſcourſes were never made publick, for the more eaſy Advertiſement of our ſucceeding Princes upon this Topick. The ſecond of them, upon the Match for Prince</hi> Henry, <hi>is treated under eight Heads; and, in the fourth Page of it,</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>has theſe Words:</hi> There is a Kind of noble and royal deceiving in Marriages between great Kings and Princes; yea it is, of all others, the faireſt and moſt unſuſpected Kind of betraying: It has been as ordinary among them to adventure or caſt away a Daughter to bring ſome Purpoſe to paſs, as at other Times, for ſaving of Charges, to make them Nuns. <hi>A little farther, having repreſented the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>ſo tied to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>both by Religion and Benefit, that he could no more be ſeparated and ſubſiſt, than if his Soul was divided from his Body, he goes on thus, more directly, concerning the Marriages.</hi> What then remains of Profit to our Prince by this Alliance? A Sum of Money, and a
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0181500200:378"/>
beautiful Lady. For Beauty (ſays he) it was never more cheap in any Age; and it is ever better loved in the Hope, than when it is had: For the Million of Crowns offered, which makes but two of our Subſidies, I ſpeak it confidently; that when thoſe Dukes, Lords, and great Ladies, who will attend the Princeſs in her Paſſage hither, ſhall be all preſented with Gifts according to their Degrees and the King's Honour; when the Preparations, Triumphs and Feaſtings are paid for, there will nothing remain but a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Charge, and, perchance, a great deal of Melancholly. <hi>And a little further,</hi> Ralegh <hi>comes cloſer ſtill, to the Prince himſelf, in theſe Words:</hi> Now, if by theſe Diſlikes of the former Alliances, you make Judgment that it is my Deſire that the Prince ſhould not marry at all; I ſay, my Deſire is not, that the Prince ſhould not marry at all, but not as yet; and I am exceeding Sorry that the Prince has not the ſame Deſire. For ſeeing his Majeſty is yet but young, and by God's Favour like to live many Years; and that his Highneſs, if he ſhould now mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may have many Children born to him, before he be <hi>30</hi> Years old; and, ſeeing all his Children ſhall be Princes, and muſt be provided for as Princes, I think it will much perplex him to find himſelf ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed, 'till his Majeſty has ſomewhat repaired his Eſtate, and provided beautiful Gardens to plant theſe Olive Branches in. While the Prince is unmarried, all the Eyes of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are upon him; for, with what King ſoever he ſhall be ballanced, he will caſt the Scale; but, to have him weighed with a little Prince, I ſhould be ſorry, and he himſelf will be as ſorry after. All the Princes in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> woo'd <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> while his Daughter was unmarried; and while our Prince is free (our Enemies not knowing upon what Ground to build their Practices) his Majeſty's Safety is in the mean while
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0181500200:379"/>
infinitely aſſured; but, the Prince once diſpoſed of, they will preſently muſter our Forces, meaſure our Fortunes, ſound us to the Bottom, and make their Approaches accordingly: they will then ſay, we have ſeen the utmoſt of the Prince of <hi>Wales! Then having obſerved, that</hi> ſince there is none but a Catholic Lady for us, let us have a King on our Side (ſays he) to boot: <hi>So, in Conſideration of the many Motives to Enmity between</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>which he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates; as alſo the many Obligations which</hi> France <hi>then lay under, of Gratitude to the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Advantage of retaining the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>he propoſes the Daughter of the</hi> French <hi>King. On the other Side, that it would be a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Hazard both to neglect this Love and Union, and ſuſtain withal the Hatred of the Archduke, the Pope, and the King of</hi> Spain <hi>together; however diſunited, they were not to be feared:</hi> For then, if they ſhould combine againſt us, from whom ſhould we hope for Help? If it be from <hi>Savoy</hi> or <hi>Florence,</hi> God help us! Our Friends inhabit beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, our Enemies at Hand! We leave thoſe that are ſtrongeſt and neareſt us, for thoſe who are weakeſt and furtheſt off! We leave thoſe that can help us, or harm us, for thoſe that can do neither! Thoſe we leave who depend on themſelves, to wit, the <hi>French,</hi> for thoſe who depend on others, to wit, the <hi>Savoyans</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines!

            <p>
               <hi>In his other Diſcourſe, on the Match that was offered for the ingenious and accompliſhed Lady</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>that Prince's Siſter, having copiouſly exemplified, as we have obſerved, what mercenary Sacrifices had been made, by crowned Heads, of their Children, in this grand Market of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and anſwered the Objection he foreſaw ſome eſpaniolized Courtiers might make, that ſeeing the</hi>

Now to confer the Poſſibility of ſuch a Fortune, upon a poor popiſh Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that can return no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Benefit to this State, were greatly for his Glory, tho' little for the Advancement of this noble Princeſs, and leſs for the Safety of this Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Dangers that it may draw upon our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy magnanimous Prince and the noble Duke of <hi>York,</hi> if the Ambition of this Match ſhould tickle the <hi>Savoyan</hi> to look after Poſſibilities, wherein there would want neither Means, Perſuaſions, nor Pardons from <hi>Rome,</hi> to practiſe any Villainy in that Behalf, whereby to benefit or ſtrengthen an Appendix of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo

devoted a Son to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> See. For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> namely the Comfort and Contentment of this worthy young Lady by this Match, as there is little in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance preſently, ſo there is leſs to be hoped for in the future. For, as first, ſhe muſt be removed far from her neareſt Blood, both by Father and Mother, into a Country far eſtranged from our Nation, as any part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and as far differing from us in Religion, as in Climate. And what true Correſpondence, or matrimonial Affection, there can be maintain'd between thoſe Perſons, whoſe Minds are different, and oppoſite in the religious Points of their Chriſtian Faith, is greatly to be doubted. Moreover it is greatly to be feared, with what Safety and Security ſhe can long live free from ſecret Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices and Treacheries, in a Country ſo near the Pope's Juriſdiction, environ'd with the Plots of the Jeſuits, who, we ſee, do daily traffick the Lives and Fortunes of all Princes who are not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Obedience; and therefore how they will entertain or tolerate the Race of our King, were too great an Error and Preſumption to truſt to: So as when the worthy Lady, hereafter by her Children or otherwiſe, has furniſh'd their Deſire, and fully ſerved their Turn, ſhe ſhall be then either forced to wound her Conſcience, by forſaking her Faith, or elſe to undergo the Scorns and Danger which ſhall be daily caſt upon her and her Family, for the Exerciſe of her Religion. And this alſo we may be well aſſured of, that, if ſhe ſhall have any Iſſue by the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they muſt all be bred and brought up contrary to her Conſcience, which can be no ſmall Grief to a virtuous and natural Mother, and as little Comfort to our just religious King, their Grandfather. Laſtly, the very binding Cauſe of Amity between all Kings, Princes and States, is their Trade and Intercourſe of their Subjects. Now
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0181500200:382"/>
there is not any Prince or State of <hi>Europe,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Countries of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have Trade withal; yea even with the <hi>Turk, Barbarian, Perſian</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> only with the Subjects of <hi>Savoy,</hi> I do not know that we have any meddling or interchange at at all: for the Duke has no Port, his Ditch of <hi>Villa Franca</hi> excepted, which is only capable of a few Gallies, either to furniſh Ships from, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, being Strangers. And therefore for his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> to match his eldeſt and only Daughter with a Prince, who has his Dependance on other Kings; a Prince jeſuited, who can neither head us in Time of War, nor trade with us in Time of Peace; a Prince, by the Situation of his Country, every Way unprofitable to us; and that, no leſs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous for his Majeſty's Daughter to live in: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve myſelf, that he is of too excellent a Judgment ever to accept of it, and his honourable Council too wiſe and provident to adviſe the Proſecution thereof. Now, if his <hi>Highneſs</hi> ſhould be pleaſed to aſk my Opinion, with what <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince he ſhould match his Siſter, were it in his own Power and Choice to make Election, I humbly deſire to be excuſed herein; for, would it become me to preſume ſo far? It is true, I have heard it, that ſome Overtures have been made for the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is as well born as the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and as free a Prince as he is. The Nation is faithful; he is of our Religion, and by him we ſhall greatly faſten unto us the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> And, for the little Judgment which God has given me, <hi>I do prize the Alliance of the</hi> Palatine <hi>of the RHINE, and of the</hi> Houſe <hi>of NASSAU, more than I do the Alliance of</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What followed was, that about a Twelvemonth after the writing of thoſe Diſcourſes, the ſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was married to <hi>Frederick,</hi> Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">This Marriage was celebrated on the 14th of <hi>February</hi> 1612, in ſuch Pomp and Splendor, that the Jewels only, which were worn by the King, Queen and Prince, were valued that Day, by his Majeſty himſelf (upon Occaſion of Diſcourſe happening of the Bravery then appearing) at 900,000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling.

Inſtead of which, his indulging, beyond all Apprehenſion of Poſſibility, at leaſt all Production of precedent, a bleſſed peaceable Temper, as his Flatterers called it, to the ſitting down a quiet Spectator of his Childrens Overthrow, and their Fortunes, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, not only all the lamentable Wars which ſucceeded throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> to the utter Ruin of his ſaid Son-in-law, and all the Princes who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him; but alſo thoſe of his Succeſſor at Home, throughout his own Dominions: For, daring not to draw his Sword, through Fear of offending the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he ſat muſing at Home, one while, how to raiſe Money by Privy-Seals, Benevolences, Crown-lands and Woods, either to cram his inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Favourites, or elſe to fit out more prodigal and frivolous Embaſſies, than would, by Arms, have ſettled his Children unmoveably in their Throne; and, at other Times, how to improve

his Sovereignty; or pick Quarrels with his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and entail them to his Heirs-general.</p>
            <p>As for the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> he is ſaid to have firſt encouraged the Prince Elector to attempt his Siſter; deſiring more to head an Army in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> than he durſt make ſhew of, and would, no doubt, have been bravely followed: But alas! that Fate, which ſo often ſuffers the unworthy to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, deprived this Kingdom of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> in leſs than a Month after the Arrival of the ſaid <hi>Elector.</hi> Some have inſinuated, as if the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe his Highneſs approved <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Diſcourſe touching a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> had a Hand in his untimely End; alledging, that, if <hi>Philip</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cut off his own hopeful Son <hi>Charles,</hi> for but pitying the People of <hi>Flanders,</hi> it can be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he (or his Son) ſhould promote the Deſtruction of a Stranger, who did ſo far applaud the Advice of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>No King, but his Father, would keep ſuch a Bird in a Cage.</hi> But, from more inteſtine and unnatural Sources, his ſudden Death is ſurmiſed by others to have ſprung; the Diſeaſe being ſo violent, that the Combat of Nature againſt it, in the Strength of Youth (he being almoſt 19 Years of Age) laſted but few Days.

and now of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> truſted to his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But, in a modern Author, we have ſome further Circumſtances of this Paſſage, which I have not elſewhere met with. For, having ſpoken of the particular Eſteem which Prince <hi>Henry</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> the conſtant Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence he kept with him by Letters and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and of the Sollicitations he had ſo repeatedly made to the King for his Liberty, as what might contribute towards his Majeſty's perſonal Prejudice againſt <hi>Ralegh,</hi> he adds: <hi>When the Prince fell into his laſt Illneſs, the Queen ſent to Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>for ſome of his</hi> Cordial, <hi>which ſhe herſelf had taken in a Fever ſome Time before, with remarkable Succeſs.</hi> Ralegh <hi>ſent it, together with a Letter to the Queen, wherein he expreſs'd a tender Concern for the Prince; and, boaſting of his Medicine, ſtumbled unluckily upon an Expreſſion to this Purpoſe,</hi> That it would certainly cure him, or any other, of a <hi>Fever,</hi> except in Caſe of <hi>Poiſon. The Prince dying, tho' he took it; the Queen, in the Agony of her Grief, ſhewed</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Letter, and laid ſo much Weight on the Expreſſion about Poiſon, that to her dying Day ſhe could never be diſſuaded from the Opinion, that her beloved Son had foul Play done him.</hi> If this was true, there might be a Streſs too confidently laid on this Medicine, in ſuppoſing that nothing but Poiſon could releſiſt the Power of it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome Inadvertency in ſtarting ſuch a Suſpicion in a fond Mother, which (in the ſaid modern Writer's Opinion) there might poſſibly be no Ground for, and might, in the Conſequence, prove fatal to <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf; tho' the ſame Author alſo knew, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was not the only Man who ſtarted that Suſpicion; for he knew what the Prince's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Chaplain preach'd at St. <hi>James</hi>'s on the Diſſolution of his Highneſs's Family; and he knew
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0181500200:389"/>
what the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> not long after ſaid in open Court about the poiſoning of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Overbury:</hi> That it was to prevent the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of another Crime of the ſame Nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon one of the higheſt Rank, whom he termed a <hi>Sweet Prince;</hi> and indeed ſeveral Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of theſe Times make no Secret of it, where they ſhew the Bickerings between Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and the aforeſaid Favourite <hi>Car,</hi> in Regard to the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> not to mention other Motives. However, the Phyſicians about the Prince gave it under their Hands, which was ſpread abroad in ſeveral Copies, that he died of a ſtrong Malignant <hi>Fever,</hi> after they had anatomiz'd him to amuſe the World (ſays another Writer) and clear the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Poiſon, as if no Venoms could produce the like Effects; while the King, to diſpel the Clouds and Monitors of Sorrow, commanded that no Man ſhould appear at Court in Mourning.</p>
            <p>Whatever was the Cauſe of this excellent Prince's Death, <hi>Ralegh</hi> had no common Share in the Loſs of him; his Highneſs having, but a few Months before he died, obtained <hi>Sherborne,</hi> with Intention to return it him, as is already obſerv'd; and we are further inform'd, that King <hi>James,</hi> to ſatisfy his Favourite <hi>Car,</hi> who was now Viſcount <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> gave him, inſtead thereof, 25000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money: So far was the Crown from gaining by this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. But now, after the Prince's Death, this <hi>Rocheſter</hi> got <hi>Sherborne</hi> of the King again; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (as ſome Kind of Compoſition or Amends) his Majeſty, we are told by <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, alſo gave his Wife and Son 8000 <hi>l.</hi> for the ſaid Eſtate. But how it thrived with <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> is evident enough in the Hiſtories of thoſe Times; where it appears, that in little more than three Years from this Prince's Death, the ſaid Favourite, by the Title of

Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> was arraigned and condemned for that black and ſhameful Buſineſs of poiſoning Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury;</hi> whereby he not only loſt <hi>Sherborne,</hi> but all thoſe other Poſſeſſions which the King had ſo laviſhly heaped upon him; for what Merits or Services, may better appear in thoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, than it is needful they ſhould do here. As to <hi>Sherborne,</hi> on whom it was next beſtowed, and upon what Conſideration, with the Attempts made after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death by his Son <hi>Carew</hi> to recover it; ſince the Accounts thereof would carry us too far beyond the Period in theſe Sheets propoſed, and indeed do more properly relate to the Story of the Son, than the Father, I ſhall here refer to an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract thereof, in a brief Memorial of the ſaid <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew Ralegh,</hi> at the Bottom of the Page <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi> was born, as is before obſerved, in the <hi>Tower,</hi> in the latter End of 1604 (or Beginning of the next Year) being aged about 13 Years at his Father's Death, as he tells us himſelf; became a Gentleman-commoner of <hi>Wadham</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1620, as <hi>Anthony Wood</hi> informs us; but indeed rather ſooner, becauſe <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi>'s own Words are, that, after having been five Years at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he came to Court, and, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> his noble Kinſman, hoped to obtain ſome Redreſs in his Misfortunes; but the King, not liking his Countenance, ſaid, he appeared to him like his Father's Ghoſt: Whereupon the Earl adviſed him to travel, which he did till the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> which happen'd about a Year after. Then returning, and a Parliament ſitting, he according to the Cuſtom of this Land, petition'd to be reſtor'd in Blood, that he might be enabled to inherit whatever Lands might fall to him, as his Father's Heir, or any other Way; but his Petition having been twice read in the Houſe of Lords, King <hi>Charles</hi> ſent Sir <hi>James Fullerton</hi> (then of the Ped-chamber) for Mr. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> who being brought into the King's Chamber by that Knight, his Majeſty (after uſing him with great Civility) told him plainly, that he had formerly promiſed Sir <hi>John Digby,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to ſecure his Title to <hi>Sherborne</hi> (it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd on him 14th of <hi>June)</hi> againſt the Heirs of Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh;</hi> whereupon <hi>Digby</hi> had given him, being then Prince, <hi>ten thouſand Pounds;</hi> ſo that now he was bound to make good his Promiſe, being King; and therefore, unleſs he would quit all his Right and Title to <hi>Sherborne,</hi> he neither could, nor would paſs his Bill of Reſtoration. Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> urged the Juſtice of his Cauſe; that he deſir'd only the Liberty of a Subject, and to be left to the Law, which was never deny'd any Freeman; but the King was poſitive, and ſo left him. After this, Sir <hi>James Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerton</hi> uſed many Arguments to perſuade Submiſſion, as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of conteſting with kingly Power, and the many Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of not being reſtor'd in Blood; all which conſider'd, together with ſplendid Promiſes of great Preferment in Court, and particular Favours from the King, not improbable, wrought much in the Mind of young Mr. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who, being not full twenty Years old (as he ſays himſelf) left friendleſs and fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it prevailed ſo far, that he ſubmitted to the King's Will.
Whereupon there was afterwards an Act paſſed 3 0 <hi>Caroli</hi> for his Reſtoration; and, together with it, a Settlement of <hi>Sherborne</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and, in Shew of ſome Kind of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, four hundred Pounds a Year Penſion, during Life, was granted to Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> after the Death of his Mother, who had that Sum paid during her Life, in Lieu of Jointure. About a Twelvemonth after this, Mr. <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi> married the Lady <hi>Philippa,</hi> Relict of Sir <hi>Anthony Aſhley,</hi> a rich young Widow, by whom he had two Sons and three Daughters, and was not long after, at leaſt before the Year 1635, made one of the Gentlemen of the King's Privy-chamber. Among the ingenious Poems of <hi>Thomas Carew,</hi> Eſq; (who was another of thoſe Gentlemen) printed 8vo. 1640, p. 80. there is a Compliment, <hi>To his Couſin</hi> C. R. <hi>marrying the Lady</hi> A. by which Letters are to be underſtood this Mr. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and that Lady <hi>Aſhley.</hi> As for the kind Token, which <hi>Anthony Wood</hi> ſays the King honoured him with at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's leaving <hi>Hampton-court,</hi> and going into the <hi>Iſle of Wight, anno</hi> 1647, it was no more than a Picture of the Lady <hi>Stanley,</hi> as I remember, which was Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s own Property; therefore she King, among the Letters he left on the Table, deſired, in one of them, the ſaid Picture might be returned him, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by thoſe Letters which were then printed, or the Extract of them in <hi>Heath</hi>'s Chronicle. In the Year 1650, and afterwards, ſeveral little Tracts of his Father's were publiſh'd and dedicated to him. In 1651, there was a Committee for the Sale of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents Eſtates; and about that Time the Earl of <hi>Digby</hi> being fled to <hi>France,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi> had a fair Proſpect to recover his Eſtate, therefore deliver'd his Caſe in to the ſaid Committee; and it was order'd, 'That this Caſe be reported to the Houſe with the Opinion of this Committee; <hi>That they conceive him a ſit Object of their Mercy.</hi> He alſo, about the ſame Time, drew up a brief Relation of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Troubles, and addreſs'd it to the Parliament. But whether printed before his Death I know not, (the Edition here uſed being dated three Years after) nor wherefore his Caſe and Petition were laid aſide. In 1656, came out the Obſervations on <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s Hiſtory of King <hi>James;</hi> which this Hiſtorian ſuppoſing to be writ by <hi>Carew Ralegh,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd an Anſwer to it the ſame Year, with ſome ſcandalous and unworthy Reflections therein upon him: But no one has given Heed to them. He certainly made his Court to the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> in Hopes of getting <hi>Sherborne</hi> by their Means.</p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Wood</hi> ſays, he cringed to Men in Power, and was made Governor of the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> by the Favour of General <hi>Monk,</hi> in the latter End of <hi>January</hi> 1659, as <hi>Whitlock</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. At the Reſtoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. his Majeſty would have confer'd ſome perſonal Honour upon him, but he declined it in Hopes of ſomething better; the King therefore Knighted his eldeſt Son <hi>Walter,</hi> who died ſoon after at <hi>Weſt Horſels,</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> his Father's Seat, which had, I think, been the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi>'s; for his Will is dated from thence, as a Friend who has ſeen it informs me. This was ſold after Mr. <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death to Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> Secretary to King <hi>Charles.</hi> He had another Seat at <hi>Kenton Park</hi> near <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> which, I think, he ſold himſelf; and dying in 1666, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Month of <hi>December</hi> according to <hi>A. Wood,</hi> in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Grave; who further ſays, he has ſeen ſome Sonnets of his Compoſition, and certain ingenious Diſcourſes in MS. alſo a Poem ſet to Muſick by Mr. <hi>Henry Lawes.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> in his Letters, gives him the Character of a Gentleman of dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Abilities, and he is by others mentioned with Honour; but far, God wot (ſays <hi>Wood)</hi> was he from his Father's Parts, either as to his Sword or Pen.</p>
               </note>; for as
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0181500200:391"/>
to his elder Brother <hi>Walter,</hi> whoſe Right it had firſt been to have purſued whatever Proſpect there
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0181500200:392"/>
was of retrieving the ſaid Eſtate, he died before their Father, as will be more particularly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered towards the Concluſion of this Work.</p>
            <p>But which of theſe two Sons was attended on in his Adventures by <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi> is not eaſy to diſtinguiſh from the Words of an Author, who writes, <hi>That</hi> Johnſon's <hi>Mother, having married to her ſecond Huſband a Bricklayer, took her Son from</hi>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:0181500200:393"/>
Weſtminſter-School <hi>(where he had made a hopeful Progreſs under the learned</hi> Camden) <hi>and made him work at her Huſband's Trade: 'till being pitied by ſome generous Gentlemen,</hi> Camden <hi>got him a better Employment; which was to attend or accompany a Son of Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>in his Adventures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gaining Experience, he made his Company accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among many.</hi> Now if this happened before <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> took to acting or writing of Plays, as our ſaid Author relates it did, then Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s eldeſt Son was ſcarce old enough to go to School, much leſs upon Adventures. Beſides, this Son never made, that we can hear of, more than one Adventure abroad, from which he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; therefore he could not part with his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant or Companion <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> in the manner our ſaid Author intimates he did after their Return. Then if we ſuppoſe it the other Brother, <hi>Carew,</hi> he never made any Adventures at all, nor ſtir'd out of <hi>England</hi> till ſix Years after his Father's Death, and then only upon a ſhort Tour for about a Twelvemonth; which was near thirty Years after <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> became a Dramatick Poet or Writer for the Stage; and when he ſeems rather to have wrote himſelf into his Penſion from the Crown, or otherwiſe into ſuch eaſy Circumſtances, as render it unlikely he ſhould attend even on <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi> in thoſe Sorrows and Difficulties he was then under; and conſequently in the whole, that either one or other ſhould part with him <hi>not in cool Blood,</hi> as our ſaid Author thinks, after their Return. Had the Time of his going abroad with the younger or the elder Brother been better adjuſted, that Particular of their Parting would need no Regard; ſeeing by what Trifles, what Miſunderſtanding between themſelves, or Miſrepreſentations by others, ſuch Diviſions are made between Perſons, who would,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:0181500200:394"/>
or might otherwiſe be moſt ſerviceable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to one another.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> was of ſuch a ſurly and <hi>hypercriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Diſpoſition, as ſome Men's Writings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome of his own, have repreſented him; as it makes ſuch parting the more plauſible, if there had ever been any ſuch Meeting, ſo it is probable it would have diſtill'd with more Acrimony from his Pen, when he was giving a Character of <hi>Ralegh</hi> as an Author, than that he could find nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, either in his Judgment or his Stile.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Temper, to all who had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him (and they were very numerous in the Time of his Felicity) eſpecially towards thoſe of any liberal Knowledge and Education, it appears to have been of ſingular Candor and Benignity. There are Examples, further than what have been beforementioned, of his Courteſy, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of many other great Perſons in his Time, towards ſuch Men of Parts as any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on his Patronage or Protection; and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted by thoſe themſelves, who had taſted the Benefits thereof. He has alſo, under his own Hand, recommended ſuch generous Treatment, as moſt coercive, eſpecially to ſuch as live under the Power or Command of others; and exploded the Auſtere, the Imperious Regimen, as what is liable to betray its Practitioners no leſs into Peril than Diſdain; where he ſhews, how contemptibly the Vain, with effectual Sourneſs, counterfeit the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Wiſe, becauſe the Shadow of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, thereby obtained, has Power to delude the Eyes only of Underlings; and how thus, the Time wherein by uſing it well, Men might attain to be ſuch as they ought, they uſually miſpend. in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appear ſuch as they are not: Yet withal,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0181500200:395"/>
not only how deceivable, but dangerous a Courſe this is; procuring, inſtead of the Reſpect that was hoped for, more Indignation than was feared. Many other weighty Counſels and uſeful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions to this purpoſe, are diſperſed up and down his Writings, both in Print and Manuſcript, which (for brevity) I forbear here to recite.</p>
            <p>But here, as <hi>Ralegh</hi> has been occaſionally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Character of an Author, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, that it is high time he ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more particularly in that Light; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any Place more properly be done, than in this ſedentary part of his Life, when moſt of his Works were written. Here then we are arrived at that part of his Story, wherein he will appear, rather a Collegian than a Captive; a Student in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, than a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower.</hi> On this Occaſion, we cannot but reflect, how well ſuch Productions, in ſuch a Situation! Such ſpacious Exerciſes of Genius, in ſuch a contracted State! will prove, that, Tho' the Soul of Man, by a Fly, or a Hair, may be ſeparated from the Body, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny itſelf cannot confine it to the Body; and at the ſame Time, how trifling a calamity Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be, to thoſe who have well employed their Liberty. Some Men, impatient under ſo many Years Reſtraint, would have pined obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away by Deſpair; and others with Rage, have made their Bonds more galling: But <hi>Ralegh,</hi> as in many other Diſaſters, ſo in this, has left us no common Example of an heroick Mind. In him we may obſerve, there is no levelling a ſublime Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with the Subalterns of Nature: Preſs it on one part, it will ſtill riſe in another; and be like ſome hardy Plants we have ſeen, whoſe Heads will ſhoot forth and flouriſh in the Sight of Mankind, tho' their Roots are cloſely fettered in Walls of Stone.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0181500200:396"/>
Happy then are they, who in their Youth have ſo fortified themſelves with Knowledge, and attained to ſuch a Reliſh of Literature, that, whereſoever they are driven by the Perſecutions of Power, they can make the Contemplation of Wiſdom beguile the Senſe of their Sufferings! Who out of the moſt prevailing Examples in all Ages, of Patience and Prudence in all Exigences, can ſet themſelves Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Fortitude, and Taſks of Imitations! Who can, out of the Misfortunes of others, extract Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations for themſelves; or partake in their Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and make it Tributary to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment! Such carry with them an infallible, an undeprivable Solace; which can relieve them in Poverty with ineſtimable Treaſure, manumiſe them in Priſon with intellectual Liberty: For the Multitudes of Anxieties which ſurpriſe illiterate and uncultivated Minds, even in the midſt of the moſt ſplendid Affluence or Adulation, are inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to them, under the darkeſt Clouds of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Reproach.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Ralegh,</hi> in his greener Years, did attain to ſuch a Taſte of Letters as all his ſucceeding Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations could never remove; and which proved not only an Ornament to thoſe his earlier and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier Days, but a Relief in his Age and Afflictions, even ſo as to render him under his darker Fortunes and Condition more illuſtrious than he was in his brighteſt Proſperity, may appear by a Survey of his Writings from the juvenile Productions of his Pen, to the more numerous and mature Offsprings of his preſent Confinement. But in this Survey, we think not the ſimple chronological Method will be either needful or acceptable; which tho' eaſieſt and readieſt for tranſcribing, would be moſt crude and disjointed in reading; and yet be incapable of admitting all into their true Order, becauſe we
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0181500200:397"/>
have not the Time that ſeveral of his Pieces were written. Therefore, that we may carry on our Diſcourſe with ſome Coherence, we ſhall attempt at ſuch a Digeſtion as, upon a little Review, will naturally ariſe, or moſt conveniently, at leaſt in this Place, lead us, as out of a flow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arden, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the high Road again of publick Action; for I might, perhaps, recommend ſome Variation, in this Arrangement, of the ſame Pieces, if they were to be revived in a uniform and methodical Edition of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Works; ſo that the junior Efforts of his Muſe, or more extemporary Products of his epiſtolary Correſpondence might not, as here for Diſpatch, lead up the reſt.</p>
            <p>Now as for theſe Productions of his Muſe, ſince ſeveral of them are mentioned in the former part of theſe Sheets, they need be here only recapitulated; as his Poem on <hi>Gaſcoign</hi>'s Steele-glaſs; <hi>The Excuſe; The Silent Lover, the Anſwer to</hi> Marloe<hi>'s Paſtoral;</hi> with his Poem of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> and two more on <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>'s <hi>Fairy Queen.</hi> Since the Time that theſe ſeven were before ſpoken of, I have met with four other ſuch like poetical Pieces, which ſeem alſo to have been compoſed by the ſame Hand, from thoſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Taulologies or Retornellos wherein his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and Madrigals are uſually ſo correſpondent with one another. Theſe were all written long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this his Impriſonment, as were probably ſome alſo in the <hi>Aſhmolean</hi> Library; namely, <hi>Erroris Reſponſio,</hi> and his Anſwer to the Lie, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we find there is a ſatirical Elegy on the Death of the Treaſurer <hi>Cecyll,</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> written within this Period, likewiſe aſcrib'd to him; and we have ſtill three Pieces more of his Poetry written afterwards, and but a ſhort Time before his own Death. Theſe are of a ſolemn Nature; as his Pilgrim, his Epigram in Alluſion
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0181500200:398"/>
to the Snuff of a Candle; Laſtly, a Divine Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, which is call'd his Epitaph.</p>
            <p>Next we might ſpeak of thoſe ſhorter Pieces alſo in Proſe, his Letters; and theſe, being written in all parts of his Life, cannot perhaps be improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> this. I have ſeen of them in Print and Manuſcript to the Number of twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight: Fourteen or fifteen of them have already been made uſe of in the foregoing Sheets; and the reſt, as they likewiſe are of perſonal Import, will be ſerviceable in the Remainder, ſo they need not be more particularly diſtinguiſh'd in this Place.</p>
            <p>But thoſe more continued Compoſitions which were the Reſult of Experience and Occaſion in his ſeveral publick Profeſſions or Engagements of Life, will, perhaps, firſt demand our Obſervation; ſuch as relate to his Character as a Warrior, a Sailor, a Diſcoverer of unknown Countries, and a Politician vers'd in the Intereſt of Nations and the Arts of Government. Among theſe, we may firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his military Diſcourſes; and theſe concern ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Defence of <hi>England</hi> in particular, or contain general Arguments and Examples of the Cauſes and Reaſons of War among Mankind. On the former Subject, he ſeems to have drawn up ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances which are but ſparingly and ſlowly come to Light. However, from what has before been obſerved, of his having had a principal Hand in the Determinations of the grand Council of War, for putting the Nation in Arms when it was under immediate Apprehenſions of the <hi>Spaniſh Invaſion,</hi> there is good Reaſon to believe he was alſo the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a Treatiſe, containing Notes of Direction for ſuch Defence of the Kingdom: Written three Years before, when the ſaid Enemies were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſhew their Deſigns. To this Treatiſe was
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0181500200:399"/>
alſo joined a Direction for the beſt and moſt orderly Retreat of an Army, whether in Campaign or Straits. And theſe were then preſented in MS. to the Privy-council. Herein, one Advice is, ſince Frontier Forces are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unlikely to prevent an Enemy from landing, that if they ſhould land, through the Deficiency or Abſence of our Shipping (for this is the Force <hi>Ralegh</hi> was ever for having firſt us'd againſt ſuch foreign Invaſions) it were better by driving or clearing the Country of Proviſions, and temporiſing, to endeavour at growing ſtronger, and rendering the Enemy weaker, than to hazard all by a confuſed and diſorderly Deſcent of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace to oppoſe the firſt landing, as their Cuſtom heretofore was. But this, chiefly, among the ſaid Reaſons and Poſitions, for preventing an invading Enemy, was a little before the Approach of the <hi>Spaniſh Armada</hi> oppugned by <hi>Thomas Gibbes,</hi> Eſq; Muſter-Maſter-General of her Majeſty's Forces in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in a Diſcourſe of the <hi>beſt Order for repulſing a foreign Force,</hi> &amp;c. which he then exhibited in Print. This produced an Anſwer, which, having been found in an old manuſcript Copy among others of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, has lately been publiſhed; and which, by ſeveral Circumſtances therein, agreeing with many in his Life as well as with ſeveral Orders in the aforeſaid Council of War, ſeveral Paſſages in his <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> and his other Writings, offers may Reaſons to believe it was written by him.</p>
            <p>But if we would ſee his Opinion upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a more extenſive and univerſal Manner, it muſt be in his Diſcourſes of the original and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Cauſe of natural and neceſſary, arbitrary and cuſtomary, holy and civil Wars; which tho' alſo publiſhed ſeveral Years after his Death, have ſufficient Marks of Genuineneſs upon them. There
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0181500200:400"/>
are other Writings of his beſides, which relate to this Topick. But as War in them is treated of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, and rather with reſpect to ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Advantages, wherewith it might have been maintained againſt our Enemies as the Poſture of Affairs then was, or the perſonal Behaviour of ſome particular Men, ſo we may think it more proper to ſpeak of them under other Diviſions.</p>
            <p>Among theſe, that which admits of his maritime Diſcourſes, may not perhaps be leaſt obſervable, being a Subject ſo ſcarcely handled by Men of ſuch Learning and Experience, yet of ſuch Importance to a People in our Situation. And under this Head, that which ſhould here be perhaps firſt ſpoken of, tho' indeed one of the laſt Pieces he wrote in this State of Durance is, his Diſcourſe of the Invention of Shipping, &amp;c. wherein he treats of the Uſe, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and Improvements thereof; the Strength and Deficiency of the Sea-forces of <hi>England, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> with five Cauſes of the Riſe of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> His Encouragement of a mutual Friendſhip between them and <hi>England,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Trade. This might lead us more particularly to his excellent Obſervations and Notes concerning the royal Navy and Sea Service, which he dedicated to the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> as is before-mentioned; therefore all we need obſerve more of it in this Place is, that herein he diſcourſes under diſtinct Heads, of the Officers of the Navy, of ſome Errors to be reformed in Ship-building; and others, in harbouring and manning the Fleet; of ſurcharging them with great Ordnance; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in ſheathing and calking; the Abuſes in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualling; Inconveniency of the Cook-rooms of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and preſſing Mariners; of Arms and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and laſtly, of Captains to ſerve in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Ships. With the ſecond Head or Chapter in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0181500200:401"/>
this Tract, agrees his Letter to Prince <hi>Henry</hi> before ſpoken of, concerning the Model of a Ship. And in his Introduction to the ſaid Obſervations, as was alſo ſaid, our Author mentions a <hi>Diſcourſe of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritimal Voyage, with the Paſſages and Incidents therein,</hi> which he had formerly written to that Prince. This, if it is now in being, muſt, I think, remain ſtill in Manuſcript; for no other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it have I elſewhere met with; therefore it has, I fear, endured the ſame Fate with that other Work, probably, more copious and conſiderable, and to which, as what might ſeem deſigned to bring the others into Practice, they may appear only preparatory. This Work, though taken Notice of by no other Author who has written of him, is thus mentioned by himſelf. <hi>Of the Art of War by Sea, I have written a Treatiſe to the Lord</hi> Henry <hi>Prince of</hi> Wales. <hi>A Subject, to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, never handled by any Man ancient or modern: But God has ſpared me the Labour of finiſhing it, by the Loſs of that brave Prince; of which, like an Eclipſe of the Sun, we ſhall find the Effects hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Impoſſible it is to equal Words and Sorrows: I will therefore leave him in the Hands of God that hath him:</hi> Curae leves loquuntur; ingentes ſtupent. This may lead us up to ſuch of his Diſcourſes as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent this Art in Execution, particularly thoſe two gallant naval Actions wherein Sir <hi>Richard Greenvil</hi> loſt his Life, and himſelf won a moſt ſignal Victory, of which his own Pen has preſerved the faithful Memorials in his <hi>Report of the Truth of the Fight about the Iſles of</hi> Azores, and his epiſtolary Account of the <hi>Action at</hi> Cadiz; both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſtracted into this Work. Nor did his Care terminate in the beſt Advice for the Regulation and Maintenance of our Shipping, or in recording ſome of the moſt notable Atchievements performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0181500200:402"/>
but extended to the Choice and Reparation of the moſt convenient Harbours for their Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that not only by his Speeches in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we have already ſeen, but alſo by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial he preſented to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> touching the Port of <hi>Dover</hi> in particular; declaring how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and profitable to her Majeſty, how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and commodious for the Realm, the rebuilding it would be; with the leaſt expenſive, and moſt perfect manner of performing the ſame.</p>
            <p>But if we advance to his more extenſive purſuits and performances relating to that Topick, they will lead us into a new Geography, into Diſcoveries and Deſcriptions of unknown Countries, with the Voyages which himſelf and others under his charge and directions made to that Purpoſe. And under this Head would fall thoſe Papers and Diſcourſes of his, concerning the Diſcovery, Plantation, and Settlement of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which were in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> as was before obſerved; but whether now recoverable I know not, nor what is become of his Treatiſe of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which ſeems to have been a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Work, by the ſhort Sketch himſelf has given of its Contents before quoted.</p>
            <p>Better Luck ſeems to have befall'n his Writings upon <hi>Guiana;</hi> for we have at leaſt four of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on that Country in being, though they, probably, are not all he writ thereon; as firſt, his <hi>Conſiderations on the Voyage for</hi> Guiana, which I never ſaw in Print. Secondly, his <hi>Diſcovery of the large, rich, and beautiful Empire of</hi> Guiana, which he printed himſelf, and being, before, largely uſed and ſpoken of, the leſs need be ſaid of it here. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his <hi>Journal of his ſecond Voyage to</hi> Guiana. This remains ſtill in Manuſcript, and perhaps ſhould do ſo; it being unfiniſhed and full of Chaſms,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0181500200:403"/>
ſeeming to contain only Notes and Obſervations for his own Memory, when he ſhould have leiſure at his return into <hi>England</hi> to digeſt and fill up the Particulars in a continued Diſcourſe: Accordingly it ſeems to have ſupply'd him therewith, when he wrote his <hi>Apology for the ſaid Voyage.</hi> But as both theſe will be made uſe of in the ſubſequent part of our Narrative, 'twill be then time enough to ſpeak more diſtinctly of them. And there alſo will be mention'd the four or five Letters we have of his extant concerning the ſaid laſt Expedition.</p>
            <p>After his writings, becoming the Character of an able Commander both by Land and ſea, if we look for him as an Author in the Civil or Political Capacity, we may find him there alſo no leſs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; we may behold him in this light no leſs qualified to govern Nations, than in the other to conquer and defend them. Some of his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions under this Diſtribution, are of a general Nature; as that call'd the <hi>Seat of Government,</hi> ſhewing it to be upheld by the two great Pillars of Civil Juſtice and Martial Policy; and how this is fram'd out of the Huſbandmen, Merchants and Gentry of the Realm. The reſt of theſe Ranks or Degrees he calls the Fruit Trees of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; or thoſe who gather the Honey, yet hardly enjoy the Wax: And as theſe feed, ſo the ſecond Sort enrich it; nouriſhing ſuch Trades as have aſſiſted our Kings with great Sums of Money, and great Fleets, upon Occaſion; while the third Sort, our Gentry, he calls the Garriſons of good Order throughout the Realm; or means rather they have been, or ſhould be ſuch, more than they were in theſe latter Times, to agree with a Note he has elſewhere dropt upon them. But this little Eſſay appears, by one Expreſſion towards the Concluſion (mentioning ſomething to be hereafter proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:0181500200:404"/>
which is not) to be no more than a Fragment. The like we apprehend of his <hi>Obſervations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſes of the Magnificency and Opulency of Cities,</hi> from a Word in the very firſt Paragraph, referring to ſuch People as ſeem to have been before mentioned. Tho' in the main this is a general Diſcourſe, it bears ſome particular References to a rude and barbarous People; and might poſſibly be the Reſult of ſuch Conſiderations as muſt have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his Mind, when thoſe Propoſitions were on foot for founding the City of <hi>Ralegh</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> as was before intimated. In this little Eſſay, after having ſpoken of the Means to civilize and reform ſuch a People, he proceeds, under diſtinct Heads, to treat of the beſt Situations of Cities for Safety and Plenty; of the Multitude of Inhabitants, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Academies, Courts of Juſtice, Artificers, Privileges and Triumphs; ſo concludes with thoſe three Cauſes of confirming a City in her Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtice, Peace and Plenty. Of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Nature ſtill is that Treatiſe we have of his, called <hi>Maxims of State;</hi> being a methodical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of Government in all or moſt of its Forms and Branches; with many of its Chapters analytically digeſted for the ſake of Brevity and Perſpicuity. Herein having explain'd and defin'd the Words Government, Policy, State and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Soveraignty, he proceeds to diſtinguiſh the feveral Sorts of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, Free State, Tyranny, Oligarchy and Commonwealth. Then of the founding a State, with its Parts, and of preſerving it under thoſe ſeveral Forms, by Myſteries or Sophiſms, Rules or Actions. Laſtly, the Converſion of States, general and particular, by foreign Invaſion, domeſtick Sedition, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration without Violence. Thus ends this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; to which is joined, as a kind of Corollary
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0181500200:405"/>
for the better uſe of the Book, two or three Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Story of <hi>David:</hi> From whence an Inference is drawn, <hi>that old Age is not always unfit for Government;</hi> and alſo a defence of that Prince for marrying <hi>Abiſhag:</hi> So cloſes with a portrait of political Nobility, in the Story of <hi>Adonijah</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring to the Kingdom; with Obſervations of the Marks to diſcern ſuch Practices; and another of the <hi>Political Prince,</hi> in a farther Example of the ſaid King <hi>David;</hi> who, tho' aged, deſerted, and rebell'd againſt by many of his Nobles, ſtirr'd up himſelf to publick Action, and thereby ſhew'd his Vigour and Sufficiency to manage the Affairs of his Kingdom.

            <p>But if we deſcend to thoſe political Writings of our Author, which were occaſionally compos'd; and with more particular Regard to the Exigents of State in his own Time, through the Virtues of a penetrating Eye into the Drifts of every neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation, and an undiſcourageable Heart for the Security and Intereſt of his own; we ſhall find them ſtill more numerous. And theſe, as they moſt of them have a ſpecial Regard to <hi>Spain,</hi> might proceed from the perfect Knowledge he had of that Kingdom and its tyrannical Practices. One Inſtance hereof we have in that Diſcourſe of <hi>The</hi> Spaniards <hi>Cruelties to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>in</hi> Havanna; which is aſcrib'd to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> with other Tracts, in a Volume among the Manuſcripts of a late Perſon of Honour.

               <hi>How War may be made with</hi> Spain <hi>and the</hi> Indies, mention'd in the ſame Place.

               </note>Further, it was this intimate Knowledge he had in the State of all the <hi>European</hi> Princes, which ſo well qualified him to give the approved Advice he did in thoſe two Diſcourſes he wrote upon <hi>The Match propounded by the</hi> Savoyan, <hi>between the Lady</hi> Elizabeth <hi>and the Prince of</hi> Piedmont: And that <hi>between Prince</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and a Daughter of</hi> Savoy, of which we have ſeveral manuſcript Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and, as I have heard, the original alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. The ſame Knowledge likewiſe, enabled him ſo dexterouſly to eviſcerate the corrupt Doctrines, and pernicious Deſigns of the Papiſts, in his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue between a Jeſuit and a Recuſant; ſhewing how dangerous their Principles are to Chriſtian Princes.</hi> Another excellent Tract we have of his in this Way of Writing is, his <hi>Dialogue between a Counſellor of</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Roger Coke,</hi> in his <hi>Detection of the Court and State of</hi> England <hi>during the four laſt Reigns,</hi> printed 8vo. the third Edition, 1697, ſpeaking of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> page 83, fixes theſe <hi>Obſervations on Trade and Commerce</hi> upon him in theſe Words: <q rend="inline margQuotes">'While he was thus confined, he was the firſt who made publick the Growth by Sea of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Riches they deriv'd from their <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon the Coaſts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which would neceſſarily follow, not only to the Loſs of the King's Sovereignty of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, but to the Trade and Navigation of <hi>England</hi> otherwiſe. After that, one <hi>Tobias Gentleman</hi> ſet forth another Treatiſe of this Nature, and how this <hi>Fiſhery</hi> might be carried on from the Ports of <hi>England;</hi> and dedicated it to the King. But the King, wholly giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to Pleaſure, neither minded one, nor regarded the other.'</q> That <hi>Gentleman</hi> was a Fiſherman, or other like Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring Man, and I have ſeen his Treatiſe; but publiſhed long before this, I think, was, which that Hiſtorian aſcribes thus to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> The firſt Edition of theſe Obſervations I could ever meet with in Print, is in 12<hi>mo.</hi> 1653, and it was bound up with the ſecond Edition of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Remains,</hi> 1656. Its anonymous Publiſher appears to be the Bookſeller; who had no other Authority for appropriating it to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> but the Opinion of a Perſon who recommended it to him as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Piece of his Writing. 'Tis true, our Author has touch'd, after a different Manner, upon the Topick, in ſome of his Tracts, and particularly at the End of his <hi>Diſcourſe of Shipping;</hi> where he laments, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That Strangers ſhould be permitted to eat us out, by exporting and importing both our own Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thoſe of foreign Nations.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I think no Treatiſe of his will be found that deſcends ſo much into minute Examples, Calculations, &amp;c. However, not to except at this, becauſe a Treatiſe upon Trade may require Obſervations ſuitable to the Subject, it does not appear probable, that the Author of theſe Obſervations, whoſe Project was, as he tells us, "To erect twenty Buſſes in ſome Sea-ports Town, ſo by Degrees to extend a thouſand or two over the Nation; who was one that had traced this Buſineſs, made his Endeavours known not only to the King, but his Noblemen, Merchants and others, who had made him Subſcriptions to diſburſe large Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for building up this great and rich Sea-city;" ſhould be a Priſoner all this while in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> No, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector, further propoſing to conſtitute a State-merchant, for theſe Purpoſes; and praying, in the Concluſion, that the King would give him leave to nominate the Commiſſioners for conferring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and making Report thereof to his Majeſty, ſeems to have been ſome manufacturing or mercantile Man, one ambitious of that Office himſelf, and conſequently none of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> But if from the Subject whereon, we bend our Conſideration to the Time when this Tract was written, we ſhall find further Objection againſt entitling our Author to it. For the very firſt Words of the Dedication are, "According to my Duty, I am embolden'd to put your Majeſty in Mind, that, about 14 or 15 Years paſt, I preſented you a Book of ſuch extraordinary Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Honour and Profit of your Majeſty and Poſterity, and doubting it has been laid aſide, &amp;c. I am encouraged to preſent you with one more, &amp;c." Now if we allow the firſt Book to have been preſented in the very firſt Year of the King's being in <hi>England,</hi> then this ſecond muſt have been preſented in 1617 or 1618, when Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was out of <hi>England,</hi> or his Thoughts far differently engag'd. But the greateſt Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all is, that there are ſeveral Manuſcripts of this Treatiſe in the Libraries of our Nobility and Gentry (more ancient than the earlieſt Edition in Print) which, as I have obſerv'd, do all entitle it to one <hi>John Keymer,</hi> poſſibly the Merchant or Vintner of that Name, whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> many Years before had licenſed to retail Wine in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as is related in the foregoing Part of this Life. With one of theſe Manuſcripts (the moſt ancient I have ſeen) among the Collections of the late Mr. <hi>Granger,</hi> there was another, written alſo in the ſame little neat old Hand, aſcribed to the ſame <hi>Keymer,</hi> and which I take to be that firſt mentioned in his Dedication laſt quoted; and alſo to agree in its Contents with <hi>John Keymer's Obſervations made upon the</hi> Dutch <hi>Fiſhery, about the Year</hi> 1601. <hi>Demonſtrating there is more Wealth raiſed out of</hi> Herrings <hi>and other</hi> Fiſh <hi>in his Majeſty's Seas and the neighbouring Nations in one Year, than the King of</hi> Spain <hi>hath from the</hi> Indies <hi>in four: And that there were twenty thouſand Ships and other Veſſels, and about four hundred thouſand People then ſet on Work by Sea and Land, and maintained only by Fiſhing upon the Coaſts of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland. Printed 8<hi>vo. Lond.</hi> (from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Manuſcript) for Sir <hi>Edward Ford,</hi> in the Year 1664.

Theſe we ſhall divide but into two Parts, and then perhaps one of them may be beſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Topic of Philoſophy. This Way ſeems to look, by its Subject, that ſhort <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Soul</hi> aſcrib'd to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> whereof there is a Copy preſerved among the <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molean</hi> Manuſcripts. It was never publiſh'd, I think, and I have not yet ſeen it; therefore can ſay no more, at preſent, of it. But we have in Print, another Treatiſe which may be admitted under this Head, being built on the Doctrine of <hi>Pyrrho</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſopher, entitled, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh's Sceptick or Speculations.</hi> This Doctrine, ſhewing how much may be ſaid <hi>for</hi> and <hi>againſt</hi> the ſame Things; ſuch an ingenious Exemplification of it as this little Tract contains, may, if diſcreetly uſed, prevent many raſh, dogmatical Determinations,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0181500200:411"/>
and inure us to a wary or prudent Suſpence of Judgment: For the <hi>Sceptick,</hi> as our Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes him, does neither affirm nor deny any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but doubts of it, and oppoſes Reaſons againſt that which is affirm'd or deny'd, to juſtify his not conſenting; becauſe he may report how Things appear, but whether they are ſo he knows not. This little Tract, as it is here handled, relates chiefly to our Senſes; but another we have, upon a more dignified Topic, as concerning our Manners, or Virtues and Vices; therefore what might be more particularly ſubdivided under the Diſtinction of Moral Philoſophy; and it is call'd, <hi>Inſtructions to his Son, and Poſterity.</hi> A Treatiſe well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an Author, who had ſeen the World in ſo many Climates, and Life in ſo many Changes. It is written in a perſpicuous Style, with forcible Arguments, and on the moſt practical Subjects. Theſe are interſperſed with ſeveral memorable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, the Fruits of his particular Experience, therefore may claim a Part in his perſonal Hiſtory; and being apt to rivet in the Mind, may prove of conſtant Uſe and Service; as touching upon the moſt incidental Engagements in Life. Thus, in his firſt Chapter upon the <hi>Choice of Friends,</hi> he ſays: <hi>Tho' I perſuade thee to aſſociate with thy Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or at leaſt with thy Peers; yet remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that thou venture not thy Eſtate with any of thoſe Great Ones who ſhall attempt unlawful Things; for ſuch Men labour for themſelves, and not for thee; thou ſhall be ſure to impart with them in the Danger, but not in the Honour; and to venture a ſure Eſtate at preſent, in hopes of a better in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is mere Madneſs: Beſides, great Men forget ſuch as have done them ſervice when they have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they would, and will rather hate thee for ſaying, thou haſt been a means of their Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:0181500200:412"/>
               <hi>than acknowledge it. I could give thee a thouſand Examples; I myſelf know it, and have taſted it in all the Courſe of my Life.</hi> From his next Chapter, on the <hi>Choice of a Wife,</hi> we have before given Extracts in this Work. His third, againſt <hi>Flatterers,</hi> ends with this Reflection: <hi>Thou may'ſt be ſure, that he, who in private will tell thee of thy Faults, is thy Friend; for he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thy miſlike, and hazards thy hatred: Few can endure it, every Man for the moſt part delighting in Self-praiſe; one of the moſt univerſal Follies which bewitches Mankind.</hi> From the fourth Chapter on <hi>private Quarrels</hi> we have already given a Taſte; and here, the chief Caution he further urges to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Inconveniences thereof, is ever to beware of unadviſed Speech. <hi>He that cannot refrain from much ſpeaking,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is like a City without Walls.</hi> And a little further, <hi>In all that ever I obſerved in the courſe of worldly Things, I ever found, that Mens Fortunes are oftner made by their Tongues than by their Virtues, and more Mens Fortunes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown thereby alſo, than by their Vices.</hi> In the fifth Chapter, among the Rules recommended to preſerve an Eſtate, the moſt preſſing is againſt Suretiſhip; adviſing rather to give a part of what a Man has, than live in continual Apprehenſion of loſing both it and his Friend. <hi>If thou art bound, ſays he, for a Stranger, thou art a Fool; if for a Merchant, thou putteſt thy Eſtate to learn to ſwim; if for a Churchman, he has no Inheritance; if for a Lawyer, he will find an Evaſion by a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or a Word to abuſe thee; if for a poor Man, thou muſt pay it thyſelf, if for a rich one, he needs it not: Therefore from Suretiſhip as from a Man-ſlayer or Enchanter, bleſs thyſelf; for the beſt Profit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn will be this, that if thou force him for whom thou art bound, to pay it himſelf, he will become thy</hi>

               <hi>Enemy; if thou ſhalt chuſe to pay it thyſelf, thou wilt be a Beggar: and believe thy Father in this, and print it in thy Thoughts; that whatever Virtue thou haſt, be it never ſo manifold, if thou be poor withal, thou and thy Qualities ſhall be deſpiſed.</hi> In the ſixth Chapter, upon <hi>Servants,</hi> he has this Advice: <hi>If thou truſt any Servant with thy Purſe, be ſure thou take his Accompt e'er thou ſleep; for if thou put it off, thou wilt then, afterwards, for Tediouſneſs neglect it; I myſelf have thereby loſt more than I am worth. Whatever thy Servant gains thereby, he will never thank thee, but laugh thy Simplicity to ſcorn; beſides, 'tis the Way to make thy Servants Thieves, who elſe would be honeſt.</hi> The ſeventh Chapter is only a Word or two againſt exceeding in the Bravery of gay <hi>Garments, as what will ſoon wear out of Faſhion, when Money in the Purſe will always be in Faſhion.</hi> The eighth is upon <hi>Riches</hi> (and as it ſeems by the Beginning, ſhould follow the Fifth) herein exhorting againſt the Attainment of them by baſe or evil Means, he charges his Son, as, never to deſtroy any Man for his Wealth, ſo, by no Means further to impoveriſh the Poor; but above all Things, to exerciſe Compaſſion towards them, as the beſt Way to Proſperity and Peace of Mind. <hi>Uſe, ſays he, thy poor Neighbours and Tenants well; pine not them and their Children, to add Superfluity and needleſs Expences to thyſelf. He that has Pity on another Man's Sorrow, ſhall be free from it himſelf; he that delights in, and ſcorns the Miſery of another, ſhall, one Time or other fall into it himſelf.</hi> The ninth is againſt the Inconveniencies of delighting in <hi>Wine,</hi> as being the greateſt Enemy to Health, Truſt, Honour and Preferment; and the laſt Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus: <hi>Now for the World, I know it too well, to perſuade thee to dive into the Practices thereof; rather ſtand upon thy own Guard againſt all that</hi>

            <p>With theſe Inſtructions to his Son, which have, I think, been oftner printed than moſt other of our Author's leſſer Pieces; there is uſually joined, in all the Editions I have ſeen, <hi>The dutiful Advice of a loving Son to his aged Father.</hi> 'Tis a Religious and Rhetorical Exhortation to prepare for his latter End; written in a general Manner, but how probably by our Author, or by either of his Sons, it is left to the critical and diſcerning Reader. All the Works I have met with further aſcribed to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> bearing any Affinity with this Claſs, are two Manuſcripts, which might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed under the Branch of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p>The firſt is his Treatiſe <hi>Of Mines, and the Trial of Minerals;</hi> a Subject on which he very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might write, both from his own Obſervations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and thoſe Engagements he might alſo have in his Native County of <hi>Devon,</hi> with his Brother Sir <hi>Adrian Gilbert,</hi> who firſt, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, begun to work the long neglected Mines in <hi>Comb-Martin</hi> (whence King <hi>Edward</hi> III. had ſupply'd his Wars againſt <hi>France)</hi> and was followed by Sir <hi>Beavis Bulmer,</hi> who from thoſe Mines recovered a great Quantity of Silver, out of which, he cauſed two maſſy Goblets to be made; one whereof was preſented to the Earl of <hi>Bath;</hi> and the other, weighing one hundred thirty ſeven Ounces, to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> in the 35th of the Queen's Reign. So that what <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> ſays to his Friend of this Iſland, that it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a Drachm of that Metal, was falſe in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0181500200:415"/>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Time, and what he could not be ſure was true in his own. But whether the ſaid Treatiſe is ſo particular as to mention any Thing of this I know not, having never ſeen it. The ſecond Manuſcript is Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Collection of Chymical and Medicinal Receipts</hi> for fixing <hi>Mercury,</hi> preparing <hi>Antimony,</hi> and for the Cure of ſeveral Diſeaſes. His Application to Studies of this Kind, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ſomewhat accountable from the Patronage, which, as in a Note before cited, it appears he had ſhewn to <hi>John Heſter,</hi> the famous Chymiſt, with the Converſation there might probably paſs between them, and the Knowledge he had learn'd from the <hi>Guianians</hi> of curing all manner of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c. 'Tis apparent, that he beſtowed ſome portion of his Time upon the Uſe of Lembicks and Crucibles while he was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſeems to have had a kind of Laboratory there for his ſaid Operations. A view of him in this light will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Expreſſion in a Character of him given by Dr. <hi>Joſeph Hall,</hi> the venerable Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> (whom Sir <hi>H. Wotton</hi> calls the <hi>Engliſh Seneca)</hi> where he ſpeaks (among other Things, which will be hereafter obſerv'd) of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Experiments</hi> in the <hi>Tower.</hi> And other Authors might be produced, who, in their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him, alſo refer to his profound Knowledge in the Myſteries of Nature, or his Inveſtigations thereof, through the Animal, Vegetable, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral World, for the Benefit of his Countrymen, notwithſtanding ſome memorable Attempts to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Proſperity in the Political World, had met with much Diſcouragement: As if, tho' he could not abſolutely recover them from ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions or Corruptions of the Mind, he was hereby reſolved to try how ſerviceable and ſucceſsful he could be againſt the Maladies of their Body.</p>

How elaborately ſoever many of theſe Pieces are allowed by others to have been written, our Author looked upon them but as little Excurſions, or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as he calls them, from his grand Labour, I mean that Ocean of Hiſtory, wherein he has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done all that went before him, and given ſuch Lights to Futurity as muſt ever be grateful. A Voyage, which, <hi>If begun even in the Dawn of his Day, when the Light of Knowledge firſt broke out upon his younger Years, and before any Wound received, either from Fortune or Time, he might yet well have doubted (as he obſerves himſelf) that the Darkneſs of Age and Death would have overtaken him long before the Performance.</hi> But being undertaken, as it was, in the Evening of a tempeſtuous Life, a Life ſo far run out in Travels and Conſiderations of ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Nature; for one under the ſoul-piercing Privations of Honour, Fortune, Freedom! One buried alive! to attempt ſuch a univerſal Revival of the Dead! And, while his Body, under all thoſe preſſures, was ſo long incarcerated, for his Brain to be delivered of that <hi>Minerva,</hi> as one calls it, his <hi>Hiſtory of the World!</hi> is an Example, that might puzzle ſuch an Hiſtorian even as <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf to parallel. For, beginning at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he has given us the Flower of recorded Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry down to the End of the ſecond <hi>Macedonian</hi> War. Thus having reviewed the three firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the World, he leaves <hi>Rome</hi> in the fourth, Triumphant, about a Century and a half before the Birth of Chriſt, comprehending a period of near four thouſand Yeas. This Work was divided by our Author into five Books, who annexed to it a very copious and uſeful Chronological Table; and it was with the further Decorations of Maps, Tables of Genealogy, &amp;c. publiſh'd in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> juſt before the Meeting of the Parliament, in a
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0181500200:417"/>
large Volume, <hi>Folio,</hi> 1614. The Approbation it has met with ſince the Author's Death has been ſo univerſal, that if they are different Editions of the Book to which we may ſee different Dates printed, we may venture to ſay, no Work, of any Author in <hi>England,</hi> has been ſo often reprinted that is of equal Size and Antiquity. The ſeveral Characters and Commendations which have been beſtow'd on this Hiſtory as well by miſcellaneous Writers, who have frequently quoted it with great Deference and Reſpect, as by Hiſtorians and Criticks, who have cloſely traced and throughly examin'd it; and as well in Verſe, as Proſe; would be too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to be here inſerted, could they be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. To provide therefore as well againſt the Ignorance as the Satiety of thoſe Readers who have not met with them, a few are preſented in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation here directed to. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This may not perhaps be better introduced than in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> who in his ingenious Book of <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> has theſe Words, "A wiſe Man, as <hi>Laurentius</hi> the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter obſerved well, does much in Solitude. So may'ſt thou employ the Hours of thy cloſe Retiredneſs, and bleſs God for ſo happy an Opportunity. How memorable an Inſtance has our Age afforded us of an eminent Perſon to whoſe Impriſonment we are all obliged, beſides many philoſophical Experiments, for that noble Hiſtory of the World now in our Hands? The Court had his youthful and freer Years, and the Tower his latter Age; the Tower reformed the Courtier in him, and produced thoſe worthy Monuments of Art and Induſtry, which we ſhould have in vain expected from his Freedom and Jollity. It is obſerved, that ſhining Wood, when it is kept within Doors, loſes its Light: it is otherwiſe with this, and many other active Wits, which had never ſhin'd ſo much, if not for Cloſeneſs." Thus in a Treatiſe call'd, <hi>Balm of</hi> Gilead; <hi>or, Comforts for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd, both moral and divine, by Dr.</hi> Joſeph Hall, <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, 12mo. 1652; afterwards reprinted under the Title of <hi>The Art of Patience,</hi> &amp;c. 8vo. 1684. In the <hi>Familiar Letters</hi> of <hi>James Howel,</hi> Eſq; ſpeaking of this rare and renowned Knight, he ſays, "His Fame ſhall contend in <hi>Longaevity</hi> with this Iſland itſelf, yea with that great World which he Hiſtoriſes ſo gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly." In another well-known Book of his, call'd <hi>Dodona</hi>'s <hi>Grove;</hi> or, <hi>The Vocal Foreſt,</hi> diſcourſing of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and deſcribing him to have been, "A Cavalier of a ſpacious Underſtanding, and of no vulgar Reach in Policy, ſcientifical, and full of abſtruſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he adds, "That tho' his Body was under Reſtraint, and coffin'd up ſo many Years, yet he never travers'd more Countries than then; for his Brain ran over all the World, as appears by that famous Monument he tranſmitted to Poſterity, and hung up in the Temple of Fame, while he was as it were buried alive." But in the Life of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> written by <hi>Anthony Stafford,</hi> Eſq; 4to. 1640, this Author goes ſo far as to ſay, That if Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the World</hi> had been written in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, we ſhould not have ſcrupled or avoided the Pains of learning that Language, only to read it. If we conſult what Character the Hiſtorians give it, we may find many of them who never name it without ſome Epithet or Sentence in its Praiſe. Thus Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in one Place calls it an <hi>excellent Hiſtory;</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>firſt or chief of Hiſtories.</hi> And thus in the Preface of Dr. <hi>William Howell</hi>'s <hi>Univerſal Hiſtory,</hi> who muſt have had continual Occaſions of inſpecting our Author's, 'tis ſaid, That <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>is never to be mentioned without Honour. Shirley,</hi> in his Life of our Author, gives it as his Judgment of his Hiſtory, "That for the Exactneſs of its Chronology, Curiouſneſs of its Contexture, and Learning of all Sorts, it ſeems to be the Work of an Age." And a little further. "That a Man, who had been the greateſt Part of his Life taken up in Action, ſhould write ſo judiciouſly, ſo critically, of Times and Actions, is as great a Wonder as the Book itſelf; and it ſtill remains in Doubt, whether the Age he liv'd in was more oblig'd to his Pen or his Sword, the one being buſy in conquering the new, the other in ſo bravely deſcribing the old World." And Mr. <hi>Echard,</hi> in the Preface of his <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, admires that Part of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory which treats of the <hi>Roman</hi> Story. "Eſpecially the laſt Hundred Years, which, ſays he, are written with very much Spirit and Judgment, and all of it with as much Skill and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yet that all before the firſt <hi>Panick</hi> War is not proportionably copious to the reſt.' But how duly it was conſidered by this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hiſtorian, whether that was not a judicious Diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in our general Hiſtorian, may be left to the Examination of others.</p>
                  <p>To this we may join the Character of Dr. <hi>Henry Felton</hi> in his <hi>Diſſertation upon the Claſſicks,</hi> where he ſays, "Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the World</hi> is a Work of ſo vaſt a Compaſs, ſuch endleſs Variety, that no Genius but one adventurous as his own, durſt have undertaken that great Deſign. I do not apprehend any great Difficulty in collecting and common-placing an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hiſtory from the whole Body of Hiſtorians; that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mechanick Labour. But to digeſt the ſeveral Authors in his Mind; to take in all their Majeſty, Strength and Beauty; to raiſe the Spirit of meaner Hiſtorians, and to equal all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the beſt; this is Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s peculiar Praiſe. His Stile is the moſt perfect, the happieſt, the moſt beautiful of the Age he wrote in; majeſtick, clear and manly; and he appears every where ſo ſuperior rather than unequal to his Subject, that the Spirit of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> ſeems to be breathed into his Work."</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:0181500200:418"/>
He took no ordinary Care to deſerve theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums; for beſides his own Learning, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0181500200:419"/>
and Judgment, which many would have thought ſufficient for any Undertaking, he with that Caution, wherewith we have beheld ſo many others of his great Enterprizes temper'd, would ſuffer no Part of this Hiſtory to paſs his own Hand, before ſome of the moſt able Scholars, whom he aſſemhled, it ſeems, for this Purpoſe, had debated the Parts he was moſt doubtful of, and they moſt converſant in, before him. Thus in the <hi>Moſaic</hi> and <hi>Oriental</hi> Antiquities, or fainter and more remote Footſteps of Time, he would ſometimes conſult the learned Dr. <hi>Robert Burhill.</hi> In all Parts of Chronology, Geography, and other Branches of mathematical Science, he wanted not the Opinions of the learned <hi>Hariot,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s three <hi>Magi,</hi> long his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Tower; and wherever he ſcrupled any Thing in the Phraſe or Diction, he would hear the acute and ingenious Sir <hi>John Hoſkyns,</hi> ſometime alſo Reſident in theſe Confines; who viewed and reviewed the ſaid Hiſtory, as we are told, before it went to the Preſs, and whom <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:0181500200:420"/>
proud of calling others his Sons, could gratify that Humour in calling Father. Thus having ſpared no Labour, and neglected no Means to bring this Work to the Perfection wherein we behold it, 'tis no Wonder that ſome Scribbler or other ſhould, upon finding it ſo univerſally read, endeavour to raiſe himſelf a little Profit or Credit from it, by pretending that the World needed an Abridgment of its Hiſtory, as if that wherewith Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> has preſented us, either is, or was intended for any Thing more. But this more ſpecious Kind of Detraction meeting with no Countenance, the Author of it threw out another, of Animadverſions upon this Hiſtory; but as inſignificant and no leſs diſregarded than the other, being agreeable to that unhappy Spirit of Contradiction which ever harraſs'd him to oppoſe the greateſt Writers in his Time.</p>
            <p>But that which is more conſiderable concerning this Hiſtory is, whether our Author ever continued it down to his own Times; and whether, on ſome Pretence that this firſt Part did not meet with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, he ever deſtroyed the ſaid Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation himſelf, as we have it in the Mouths of every Body when they ſpeak of him, but in the Belief of no-body who knows any Thing of his Story or his Character. All that he ſays himſelf, in the leaſt glancing this Way, is firſt in his Preface, <hi>That he propoſed to confine his Diſcourſe with this our renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſle of</hi> Great-Britain. And <hi>That he forbears to promiſe a ſecond or third Volume, which he intends if the firſt receives Grace and good Acceptance, for that which is already done may be thought enough and too much.</hi> Laſtly, in the Concluſion of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> he ſays, <hi>Whereas this Book by the Title calls itſelf</hi> The firſt Part of the General Hiſtory of the World, <hi>implying a ſecond and third Volume, which I alſo intended and have hewn out; beſides many</hi>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:0181500200:421"/>
               <hi>Diſcouragements perſuading my Silence, it has pleaſed God to take that glorious Prince out of the World to whom they were directed; whoſe unſpeakable and never-enough lamented Loſs has taught me to ſay with</hi> Job, Verſa eſt in luctum cithera mea, &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganum meum in vocem flentium. From hence it ſeems plain enough, that our Author had only ſome Plan, or perhaps a few rough Draughts of ſome ſucceeding Parts of the Hiſtory at this Time drawn up, and that he was diſcouraged from making any further Progreſs in them. Allowing his Mind might change, and that there was Time enough to finiſh the remaining Volumes between this Year, and that of his Death, which is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowable; yet as we know how moſt of that Time was employ'd by him, it will admit of no room for any ſuch Performance. For in 1615, the Year which followed that wherein he publiſh'd his Hiſtory, two at leaſt of his moſt elaborate Tracts beforemention'd were written. The ſame Year he was alſo buſy in writing Letters, and making other Intereſt for his Releaſement, which he obtain'd before it was quite expired. After this, it will no leſs appear, that he made himſelf too eminently the ſubject of modern Hiſtory, to be any further an Author of that which is ancient. There is, indeed, a little Intimation of the Deſign he had upon ſome ancient Part of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Story, preſerved in a Letter of his own, written it ſeems, tho' undated, before his great Work was publiſh'd, to that Acquaintance, whoſe Library was moſt likely to accommodate him with thoſe uncommon Books which he wanted for his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This Letter is as follows. <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>If you have any of theſe old Books, or any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts wherein I may find any of our</hi> Britiſh <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities; if you pleaſe to lend them me for a little</hi>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:0181500200:422"/>
               <hi>while, I will ſafely reſtore them, and think myſelf much beholden unto you: Or if you have any old</hi> French <hi>Hiſtory, wherein our Nation is mentioned; or any elſe, in what Language ſoever.</hi> (So ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes himſelf) <hi>Your poor Friend,</hi> W. Ralegh. But this does not ſufficiently aſſure us, whether the Uſe of theſe Books was to continue his <hi>General Hiſtory,</hi> or furniſh him upon ſome more particular Subject, however, we may incline with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Life to the former Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And as for the Reaſons of one ingenious Author, <hi>why Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>was the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon to write the Hiſtory of his own Time;</hi> and the Opinion of another, <hi>That his admirable Performance, already publiſhed, ſufficiently ſhews, that if he had attempted the</hi> Hiſtory of his own Country, or his own Times, <hi>he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd even</hi> Livy <hi>or</hi> Thucydides; <hi>and that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>by his Pen, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing from the ſerious and judicious</hi> Camden, <hi>had been the brighteſt Glory of her Reign; and would have tranſmitted his Hiſtory as the Standard of our Language, even to the preſent Age:</hi> Theſe are ſtill no Affirmatives that he did finiſh ſuch a ſecond Part. So that his own Intimations in the firſt Part, reſerv'd and inconcluſive as they are, ſeem to have been the only Foundation of that formal Story, <hi>How Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>a few Days before his Death, ſent for</hi> Walter Burre, <hi>the Bookſeller who had printed his firſt Volume, and taking him by the Hand, aſked him, How that Work of his had ſold? who anſwer'd, So ſlowly that it had undone him; hereupon</hi> Ralegh <hi>ſtepping to his D ſk, reach'd out the other Part of his Hiſtory, which he had brought down to the Times he liv'd in, then ſaying, with a Sigh, Ah Friend! has the firſt Part undone thee? the ſecond Volume ſhall undo no more; this ungrateful</hi>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:0181500200:423"/>
               <hi>World is unworthy of it; ſo ſtept to the Fire, threw it in, and ſet his Foot on it till it was conſum'd.</hi> But, as we obſerved before, <hi>Ralegh</hi> had no Leiſure to finiſh ſuch a Second Part of his Hiſtory down to his own Time. In the next Place, 'tis no ways probable that he, who, in Regard to the firſt Part, could follow the Rule of <hi>Seneca;</hi> that he, who <hi>having ſatisfied his own Conſcience, could diſregard the Cenſure of others,</hi> ſhould ſacrifice ſo great a Part of his Labours, or any Part, in ſuch a raſh and inconſiderate Manner, to the ſudden Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Bookſeller, without ever ſuſpecting any mercenary Ends in him. Further, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear true that the firſt Part did ſell ſlowly, for there was a ſecond Edition of it ſet forth by that very Bookſeller, within three Years after the firſt; and laſtly, the firſt Man we can meet with who reports the ſame, is a trifling and ſuperficial Writer, who produces no Authority for his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As to the unfiniſh'd Parts he might have of ſuch a Continuation, to admit that they were thus deſtroy'd would, moreover, in no wiſe agree with an Account we have more ſatisfactorily atteſted of that great Quantity there was in Being of Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi>'s unprinted Writings, ſeveral Years after his Death. For it is affirm'd to us, <hi>That the famous Mr.</hi> Hamden, <hi>a little before the Civil Wars, was at the Charge of tranſcribing</hi> 3452 <hi>Sheets of Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh<hi>'s Manuſcripts, as the Amanuenſis himſelf told me (ſays my Author) who had his cloſe Chamber, his Fire and Candle, with an Attendant to deliver him the Originals, and take his Copies as faſt as he could write them.</hi> Yet what is become of this Treaſure now, I have not been able to learn; for, if we ſuppoſe that Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> would not be at the Trouble and Charge of tranſcribing any of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0181500200:424"/>
our Author's Writings which had then been printed; and grant that all of his which have been printed ſince that Time, as well as all we can hear of remaining in MS. which are allow'd to be his, were Part of that Collection or Quantity, they will not, both join'd together, as might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted from what is here obſerved of them, amount to a fourth Part thereof, tho' we ſhould admit two or three Pieces more, alſo aſcribed to him, which have not yet been named, and happen to fall under his hiſtorical Diviſion. The Firſt of them is call'd, <hi>A notable and memorable Story of the cruel War between the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>and their own Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Gather'd out of</hi> Polybius <hi>and other Authors, by that famous Hiſtorian Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh. The other two Pieces might ſeem to fall within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Continuation of his Univerſal Hiſtory; but the firſt of them, call'd <hi>The Life and Death of</hi> Mahomet; <hi>the Conqueſt of</hi> Spain; <hi>together with the Riſing and Ruin of the</hi> Saracen <hi>Empire,</hi> aſcribed to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> near twenty Years after his Death, by the Bookſeller who dedicated it to his Son, is, except a few Leaves about that of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> no more than a Tranſlation of an Epitomy made by ſome ignorant <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Author, chiefly from what one of his own fabulous Countrymen had written of a fictitious Prince named <hi>Jacob Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſor,</hi> as I have been aſſur'd by a Gentleman of great Knowledge both in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Oriental</hi> Writers. But the Stile itſelf, ſo uncouth in ſome Places, ſo meagre in others, and incorrect, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in known Things, Places, and Perſons, might of itſelf exclude our Author from having any hand it. The other Piece is ſtiled, <hi>An Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to a Breviary of the Hiſtory of</hi> England; <hi>with the Reign of King</hi> William I. <hi>entitled the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, written by Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh. It was near

fourſcore Years after his Death before this was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd. Yet there are ſeveral old manuſcript Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it in the Libraries of the Curious, which entitle him the Author of it; but it was written at leaſt two Years before he publiſh'd his <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> becauſe it was inſcribed to a Perſon who died ſo long before the ſaid Publication, in theſe Words: <hi>I intend by the Help of God and your Furtherance, right noble Earl of</hi> Saliſbury, <hi>to write a brief Hiſtory of</hi> England <hi>from</hi> William <hi>the Firſt, entitled the Conqueror, to the End of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>of perpetual Memory.</hi> But by then his <hi>Hiſtory of the World</hi> was finiſh'd, he was, as we have obſerved, alſo from his own Words, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from all Continuation. To theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements might be added, the ungrateful Treatment which was ſhewn to this Part he did publiſh, at its firſt Appearance: For tho' we have obſerved what univerſal Approbation it has met with ſince the Author's Death; yet how it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiv'd as ſoon as it came abroad and made its firſt Viſits at Court, we are yet to relate.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who thought the King muſt needs be a Patron of Authors becauſe he was one of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, have been ready to inſinuate, that his Favour encreaſed towards <hi>Ralegh</hi> in Proportion to the Proofs his Pen had given of his Abilities; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that his many excellent Writings, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> were the moſt powerful Interceſſors for his Releaſment out of the Tower; as if his Majeſty, in reſpect to his own Honour, thought it in vain longer to confine his Perſon, ſince no Condition could confine his Fame; or, in Regard to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Merit, that he had well deſerved no Place ſhould be a Barrier to his Liberty, who had given ſuch extraordinary Teſtimony that no Age could ſet a Bound to his Knowledge. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi>

has deſcrib'd the Freedom which not long after enſu'd, to one of thoſe Motives; where he ſays, <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>wearied with long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and having there ſpent his Time well in the</hi> Hiſtory of the World, <hi>made his Petition more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to the King; whoſe Love to Learning granted him now at laſt his Liberty; and, not long after, Leave to wander after a Deſign to the Weſtern World, where he had been in ſeveral Climates before.</hi> But others, who ſeem to have known the Matter much better, or have more ingenuouſly imparted it, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s excellent Talents were ſo far from ingratiating him with the King, <hi>that tho' his Majeſty had been intemperately praiſed by Flatterers for ſome of the weakeſt of his own Compoſitions, yet he could not forbear, out of an impertinent Emulation, to affect Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>the leſs, becauſe of the great Repute which followed him for his excellent Pen.</hi> Nay, we are elſewhere told, in Anſwer to <hi>Sanderſon</hi> above, that <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the World</hi> gave the King ſo much Diſpleaſure, <hi>that at its firſt Publication it was forbid; and particularly, for ſome Paſſages in it which offended the</hi> Spaniard; <hi>as alſo for being too plain with the Faults of Princes in his Preface.</hi> For it is, indeed, repleniſh'd with many remarkable Examples of divine Vengeance pour'd forth on Princes of many other Nations as well as our own, who ſtrove to eſtabliſh their Thrones by Oppreſſion and Iniquity. That Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in Anſwer to <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> is ſo far from being deny'd by this Writer, that he afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it in Contradiction to what himſelf had written as above, about <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Petition being made more paſſable by his Hiſtory; where, after his groſs Manner of Interpretation, he ſays, <hi>King</hi> James <hi>and all other Princes had Cauſe of Complaint, becauſe his whole Book ſets out the Eaſtern Monarchs</hi>

               <hi>with much Glory, and exclaims againſt Chriſtian Princes as moſt inhuman; tracing all the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Sovereigns from the Conqueſt, eſpecially</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth; whom, for his Daughter's Honour, Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>might have ſpar'd from Gall and Bitterneſs.</hi> And a little further, <hi>King</hi> James <hi>might perhaps obſerve more, to repreſs the Wickedneſs of ſuch a Perſon, who, under Pretence of taxing a Vice in the Father, intended cunningly to ſtain the whole Race,</hi> &amp;c. This Objection againſt <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the King, is more particularly aſcribed to King <hi>James</hi> by another Writer alſo before-cited, who tells us, <hi>That after much Scorn caſt upon</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh's <hi>Hiſtory, the King, being modeſtly demanded What Fault he found? anſwered, as one ſurprized, That</hi> Ralegh <hi>had ſpoken irreverently of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth!</hi> as if he would have reflected a Breach of Gratitude upon our Hiſtorian towards his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs the late Queen, In ſpeaking ſuch Truth when he was to give a Character of her Father as, not only others who read it muſt concur in, ſeeing the Hiſtorian has ſo many Proofs at his Finger's End to confirm it; but what that King himſelf, were he alive, on whom it was written, muſt alſo have allowed; ſince it is only a Paraphraſe upon his own dying Confeſſion, that he had been <hi>a Prince, who never ſpared Man in his Anger, nor Woman in his Luſt.</hi> But if King <hi>James</hi> could thus object againſt <hi>Ralegh</hi> for one Character, and pay him no Thanks for another which follows in the ſame Paragraph of that Preface, and in ſome Parts of the Hiſtory itſelf; this may perhaps beſt ſhew where lay the Breach of Gratitude. But however his Majeſty might think it a Kind of Blaſphemy, that any below the Dignity of Princes ſhould be the Cenſors of them: Yet that Objection aforeſaid ſeems not to be the natural Cauſe, ſays our laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0181500200:428"/>
Author, of his Diſlike to this Hiſtory, <hi>ſince none ever exclaim'd more againſt that Prince than uſually King</hi> James <hi>himſelf did.</hi> And others, more particularly ſtill, are inclin'd to believe, that any Liberty <hi>Ralegh</hi> may have taken with the Characters of other Princes, was not ſo much the real Cauſe of ſuch Diſguſt in King <hi>James,</hi> as, through the Inſinuations of ſome miſchievous Sycophants about him, who knew well what Humour might be moſt agreeably fed, that ſeveral Parts of the Hiſtory contained an oblique and artful Expoſure of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Miniſtry; as if, truly, the general <hi>Hiſtory of the World</hi> was chiefly a ſecret Hiſtory, or Satire upon his Court; and <hi>Scotch</hi> Faces were to be ſeen in it, ſtuck upon old <hi>Jewiſh, Babylonian</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Shoulders. For, as one has obſerv'd, <hi>There was a Time, when one of our moſt renowned Hiſtorians could not comment upon a Piece of the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>without being thought to write a Libel upon his own Times; and the King was almoſt led to fancy, he ſaw his own Features in the Face of</hi> Ninias <hi>the Son of Queen</hi> Semiramis; <hi>but ſurely, if he could think his Juſtice cenſured in the Story of</hi> Ahab<hi>'s taking away</hi> Naboth<hi>'s Vineyard, and not commended in that of the</hi> French <hi>King's Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Judge and Admiral of</hi> France; <hi>he muſt not only have been a very captious and ſelf-tormenting Reader, but have ſatiriz'd himſelf more ſharply by engroſſing of Application, or acquieſcing in Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, than he could have been by that Author, had he really intended any.</hi> But the Truth is, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious Minds can find in every Example ſomething to chaſtiſe themſelves; and, to Stomachs vitiated, through foul and unwholſome Adminiſtrations, with evil Habits, the moſt innocent Diet is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding. That <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſoreſaw his Enemies would make ſuch perverſe Conſtruction and Miſuſe of his
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0181500200:429"/>
Hiſtory, is evident enough in his own Words; where, mentioning the Choice he had made, at leaſt exceptionable, of the elder Times to deſcribe, he yet anticipates this Objection, <hi>Againſt this Choice alſo: Why may it not be ſaid, that in ſpeaking of the paſs'd I point at the preſent; and tax the Vices of thoſe who are yet living, in their Perſons who are long ſince dead, and have it laid to my Charge? But this I cannot help, tho' innocent; and certainly, if there be any, who, finding themſelves ſpotted like the Tygers of old Time, ſhall find Fault with me for painting them over anew, they ſhall therein accuſe themſelves juſtly, and me falſely.</hi> Yet ſuch Fault there was, we ſee, found; and ſo falſely was he accuſed. Thus the Honour which ſhould reward a publick Benefit, is ſtifled by private Prejudice.</p>
            <p>We are therefore to ſeek ſome other Mediator for <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Deliverance out of Priſon than his Merit by this publick Benefit; and that, we ſhall at laſt find to be his Money, tho' other Cauſes in our common Hiſtories are alſo ſuggeſted, eſpecially that which ſeemed moſt effectual, the Offer he made of fitting out an Expedition to ſecure, and poſſeſs for the Crown, a Gold Mine in <hi>Guiana,</hi> which he had himſelf diſcover'd when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in that Country; and which, ſince that Time, had been by others ſo amply teſtified, that further Confirmation was not now requir'd. So that <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s being deceiv'd by <hi>Keymis</hi> with Ore of a golden Complexion, which he brought from thence, or by any chymical Tricks, ſuch as ſecretly ſlipping real Gold with the Ore into the Melting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, are fooliſh Untruths. Now that Offer <hi>Ralegh</hi> had made at leaſt three Years before he obtain'd his Liberty, with no unreaſonable Expectation of its being accepted, ſince King <hi>James</hi> had ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly aſſerted and confirm'd the Right of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:0181500200:430"/>
to that Country, through Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and Diſcoveries therein, with the Submiſſion he had gain'd from the chief Lords thereof, as to have given Commiſſions and Patents for the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame, that is to ſay, all from the River of <hi>Amazons</hi> to the <hi>Deſſequebe,</hi> and all the Iſlands for twenty Miles about, in his Majeſty's Name; which were accordingly executed in all due Form by Captain <hi>Charles Leigh</hi> and Captain <hi>Robert Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> which laſt left a Colony there of thirty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for three Years, as may be read at large in the Narratives of their ſeveral Expeditions. Beſides, the publick Invitations and Encouragement which afterwards enſued, to all who would again ſettle and plant in that new diſcover'd Part of <hi>America,</hi> gave the Diſcoverer himſelf no doubt, the greater Hopes that his own Propoſitions, being not for his private, but the publick Benefit (yet at his own Expence, and that of ſuch Friends as he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the Adventure) could not but be embrac'd. Add to this, the Advantages of his further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Riches of this Country, even while he was in Priſon, not only by the long Converſation he had with thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> whom we find here with him in the former Part of his Confinement, but others who from Time to Time came over to him. For during this long Impriſonment, he held conſtant Intercourſe with <hi>Guiana,</hi> and was at the Charge every Year, or every ſecond Year, of ſending a Ship or more thither, to keep them in Hopes of being relieved from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had again encroach'd upon them, and cruelly maſſacred both ſeveral of the Natives, and of his own Men. So that the Number of Voyages he ſet forth for <hi>Guiana,</hi> was at leaſt as many, if not more, than thoſe he is before obſerved to have fitted out for <hi>Virginia.</hi>

            <p>

But all this Experience, which ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his Offer, ſerv'd at firſt only to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unacceptable. For the Treaſurer <hi>Cecyll</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then alive, he, with two or three others who bore the Sway at Court, were reſolved to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it; not that they ſo much doubted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that ſuch Treaſure might remain unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, or the Knowledge and Reſolution of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> to compaſs it, ſo much as his Diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themſelves, if by a ſucceſsful Return he ſhould purchaſe the King's Favour. Therefore, to prevent ſuch a Rival as he might prove to them, the Advantage he propos'd to the State was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; nay, ſo deeply had they rooted Prejudices in the King's Breaſt towards him in this particular, as well as in others before-mentioned, that when his Majeſty was ſollicited by any Perſon in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Behalf (and Royal Sollicitors he had) he, with that implicit Reliance on other Men's Reports, which thoſe in ſupreme Station ſo often bury their own Judgments and their Juſtice in, would anſwer, <hi>That his Council knew him better than he did.</hi> But after <hi>Cecyll</hi>'s Death, and now that Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> was Secretary of State, <hi>Ralegh</hi> reviv'd his Propoſal to him, and, in a Letter, told him, with relation to thoſe two or three Earwigs who were ever crawling about the King, and at the Mercy of whoſe Repreſentations he had ſo long lain, that it was his only Infelicity the King did not know him as well as thoſe Courtiers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do: <hi>For had his Majeſty known me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I had never been here where I now am; or had I known his Majeſty, they had never been ſo long there where they now are. His Majeſty not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me has been my Ruin, and his miſknowing them has been the Ruin of a goodly Part of his Eſtate. But they are all of them now, ſome living and ſome</hi>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:0181500200:432"/>
               <hi>dying, come to his Majeſty's Knowledge.</hi> We learn fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therout of the ſaid Letter, that both Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> who had inform'd herſelf from the Beginning of all that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had been accus'd with, and her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> at both times of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England,</hi> were thoroughly ſatisfy'd of his Innocency, otherwiſe they would never have moved his Majeſty in his Behalf. And Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who had been curious in ſearching into the Nature of his Offences, had been frequently a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for him, as we have read before. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, ſays <hi>Ralegh, The Wife, the Brother, and the Son of a King, do not uſe to ſue for Men ſuſpect; but ſince they have all done it, and with Reference to me alone, you, ſtrengthned by their Example, may with the more Hardineſs do the like.</hi> Towards the End, <hi>Ralegh</hi> having acknowledged, that all he had remaining was owing to the King, and that he was ready to ſacrifice it all in his Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, concludes with this noble Diſtinction, <hi>To die</hi> for <hi>the King, and not</hi> by <hi>the King, is all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition I have in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This and other like Addreſſes to that new Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, advanced not <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Requeſt ſo much, but he found it neceſſary to uſe ſtronger Intereſt than what he was here making, and more ſubſtantial Arguments than could flow from a Pen. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Pity of his Sufferings, his Merit, and Fame of Learning now begat in many, or by whatever means of the</hi> French <hi>Ambaſſador, with others of our own Lords,</hi> it is pretended in our common Accounts of him, that <hi>he got Freedom of repairing for his Health to his Houſe at</hi> St. James's, <hi>a Year or two before he procured his Commiſſion for his Voyage to</hi> Guiana, we are more poſitively and particularly told, <hi>That Sir</hi> William St. John <hi>and Sir</hi> Edward Villiers, <hi>Half-brother to the Lady</hi> Villiers, <hi>afterwards Dutcheſs</hi>

If it ſucceed well, a good Part of the Honour ſhall be yours; and if I do not alſo make it profitable unto you, I ſhall ſhew myſelf exceeding ungrateful. In the mean while, and till God diſcover the Succeſs, I beſeech you to reckon me among the Number of your faithful Servants, tho' the leaſt able.</hi> W. Ralegh. This Letter is dated only <hi>March</hi> 17, but probably written in this Year laſt mentioned, 1615; becauſe three Days afterwards, as <hi>Camden</hi> has preciſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was releaſed out of the <hi>Tower.</hi> So that he thus purchas'd his Liberty in the thirteenth Year of his Confinement; that is to ſay, after he had been (without Intermiſſion) twelve Years, three Months, and five Days, in the ſaid <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> beſides near three Months more at his firſt Commitment thither, and during his Arraignment at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this Time <hi>Carr,</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> had been about four or five Months in the ſaid Tower with his Counteſs, for the barbarous Impoiſonment of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> about two Years before in the ſame Place, to which he had treacherouſly driven him, for only having obſtructed the ſaid Earl's vile and ſcandalous Commerce with that lewd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, while ſhe was young <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Wife. <hi>Theſe two Accidents (at this Time drew great Notice) happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:0181500200:434"/>
               <hi>(as 'tis obſerved in a Tract aſcribed to the Lord</hi> Brook) <hi>ſo much beyond all Expectation; that the one, being a ſpecial Favourite of the King, the other a condemned Man; the one impriſon'd, the other ſet at Liberty; gave great Occaſion of Speech and Rumour, and ſo much the more Wonder and Admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Wit and Policy. Raleigh</hi> is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid by the ſame Author, to have given <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi> many Quips and Taunts during his ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment; and it may not be improbable, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch an undeſerving Intruder upon his Eſtate. But, as this Earl of <hi>Somerſet</hi> was convicted of Felony for the ſaid Murder, whereby the Two hundred thouſand Pounds he had heap'd up, and Lands to the Income of Nineteen thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> being again diſpers'd; and as the King had laid that heavy Curſe upon himſelf and his Poſterity which he did, if ever he pardon'd any of the ſaid Murderers, it might have been thought that <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Compariſon of himſelf and that noble Malefactor, would not have been ſpoil'd, when he ſaid, <hi>That the whole</hi> Hiſtory of the World <hi>had not the like Precedent, of a King's Priſoner to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Freedom, and his Boſom Favourite to have the Halter, but in Scripture, in the Caſe of</hi> Mordecai <hi>and</hi> Haman. Inſtead of that, <hi>Ralegh</hi> is ſaid, by the Relater of this Paſſage, to have been told, the King ſhould reply upon hearing this Obſervation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That</hi> Ralegh <hi>might die in that Deceit;</hi> and ſo he did, as this Author truly ſays: For the King now ſav'd the Life of the one, as much to the Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, as he afterwards put the other to Death. But he could do no leſs, if his Favourite was really a Maſter of ſuch Secrets as are elſewhere ſpoken of. And this is enough to reſolve why the Misfortunes of that Earl, if they may be called ſuch, which at the Worſt were more favourable
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0181500200:435"/>
than his Merits in any wiſe deſerved, were not equal to his Crimes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ralegh</hi> being thus at Liberty, ſoon appears buſy in making Preparation for his Voyage. To this Purpoſe he called in the 8000 Pounds, which he had lent to the Counteſs of <hi>Bedford,</hi> reckon'd in King <hi>James</hi> his Declaration, a competent Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for <hi>Sherborne;</hi> tho' it was afterwards valued by the State at 5000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> But ſeeing that not ſufficient to fit out a Fleet in the Manner he found neceſſary, his Wife conſented alſo to ſell her Houſe and Lands at <hi>Micham</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> for which he received 2500 <hi>l.</hi> all which and more he expended in this Expedition. And what Frenzy could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs him, as he ſays himſelf, thus to diſpoſe of his whole Subſtance, and undertake ſuch a toilſome and perilous Voyage, now that his Conſtitution was impair'd by ſuch a long Confinement, beſides Age itſelf, Sickneſs and Affliction, were he not aſſur'd thereby of doing his Prince Service, better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Country by Commerce, and reſtoring his Family to their Eſtates, all from the Mines of <hi>Guiana;</hi> and, ſays he, <hi>if I myſelf had not ſeen them with my own Eyes.</hi> I have not yet heard who was the Purchaſer of that Eſtate at <hi>Micham;</hi> but there is a Letter of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s to a Nobleman extant, which poſſibly relates thereunto. It is to intreat him to make an impartial Valuation of ſome Lands to a riſing Favourite, who was to be the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, and is penn'd in the following Words: <hi>I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to give me Leave, and Pardon too, if I need it, for the anſwering of thoſe Things which you were lately pleas'd to object againſt me; and that you will charitably alſo conſider both of my Demands, and of the Reaſons which embolden me to make them. Thoſe Anſwers go here, in a Paper which is enclos'd, apart; and my Letter ſhall ſay but</hi>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:0181500200:436"/>
               <hi>thus much, that the Gentleman, who is ſo greatly in favour, hath many fair Fortunes before him, and we, nothing to look for but Miſery; and that he is better able to give us above the Worth of the Land, than we in condition to abate any Part thereof. And therefore we humbly beſeech your Lordſhip, that your</hi> Compaſſion <hi>and Care of</hi> Honour, <hi>may be the Judge between his proſperous Navigation, and our Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck: And that your</hi> Charity <hi>for us, and your Deſire of</hi> Satisfaction <hi>for him, may equal the Ballance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. I hope ſo heartily to find all juſt Favour at your Hands, as I will venture, upon this, to oſſure you, that I will do all my utmoſt to make my Wife and Son forget themſelves, and be ever mindful of their Duty towards your Lordſhip; to whom I hope they will be, as I am ſure myſelf have been, and am, a moſt faithful humble Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the ten thouſand five hundred Pounds which it coſt Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> to put himſelf in Equipage for this long-propoſed Voyage, a much greater Sum than would have paid for his Liberty of receding from it, or for a formal Pardon, had he thought he needed, and had gone about to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it; there were many Co-adventurers, who by Contributions to the Expence thereof, intitled themſelves to a Share in the Returns. But moſt of theſe are called by <hi>Ralegh,</hi> a Company of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, who had never ſeen the Sea nor Wars; and, except ſome forty Gentlemen, a very diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, diſorderly, and ungovernable Crew, <hi>whom their Friends thought it an exceeding good Gain to be diſcharged of, at the Hazard of ſome thirty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or fifty Pounds, knowing they could not have lived a whole Year ſo cheap at Home.</hi> There were, moreover, ſeveral Merchants, not only in <hi>England</hi> but foreign Parts, who contributed to this <hi>Mine-Adventure;</hi> ſo confident were they that it was no

Chimera, no ſuppoſititious or airy Treaſure that was promiſed or purſued. One of theſe Merchants, afterwards knighted, and very eminent for his Dealings, was named <hi>Peter Vanlore,</hi> who ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Undertaking, that he not only ſent a Letter to his Brother Sir <hi>Adrian Thibaut</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> requeſting him to engage another Merchant there to communicate ſomething he knew of the Riches in <hi>Guiana</hi> to Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh;</hi> but made that Requeſt in <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s own Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expreſſion, from a Copy which he drew up for him. This Draught, as I have it from the ſaid Original, is as follows: Brother <hi>Tibotes, There is a Merchant in</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>that for the Love he bears to my honourable Friend Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to diſcover ſomewhat of Importance unto him in</hi> Guiana, <hi>to which Country Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>is now preparing to go; but he doth require Aſſarance from Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>that he himſelf may be aſſured to enjoy ſuch Part of the Commodity diſcover'd, as he ſhall agree upon with Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Mr.</hi> Henry Hovenar. <hi>I do therefore pray you to ſpeak with the Party which Mr.</hi> Hovenar <hi>will bring unto you, and to know what Aſſurances he will require, which to pleaſure Sir</hi> Walter <hi>I ſhall be willing to give; that is to ſay, to give him Aſſurance that upon Sir</hi> Walter<hi>'s Return into</hi> England, <hi>the Charges being deducted, the Diſcoverer ſhall receive from Sir</hi> Walter <hi>ſuch Part of the ſaid Merchandize as Sir</hi> Walter <hi>and he ſhall agree on; altho' there needs no ſuch Aſſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>unto him, to be deliver'd here in</hi> London, <hi>to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall appoint to receive it."</hi> Then in a new Line he concludes thus: <hi>To Mr. Peter Vanlore. This is the Letter which I deſire you to write to your Brother in</hi> Amſterdam; <hi>and for any Aſſurance you ſhall give, I will again put you in Sureties to ſave you harmleſs.</hi> W. Ralegh. This Letter is dated <hi>July</hi> 1, 1616. And if <hi>Ralegh</hi> had his Commiſſion for that Voyage before this Time, as it appears he had, by his citing it, then it muſt be erroneouſly dated, being near two Months after, in King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration. Here again, that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeems to have been given under the Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> and alſo elſewhere: In that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, 'tis ſaid to be under the Privy Seal. But there are other Things obſervable of this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as it is there printed, and in other Places, as we ſhall ſee preſently.</p>
            <p>In the mean while we may here obſerve a little Oppoſition that was made to this Voyage. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome Perſons at Court, who might remember what Advances <hi>Ralegh</hi> had formerly made there, by the Means of ſeveral Exploits which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took at a Diſtance from it; and others, admoniſh'd by Conſcience, that every friendly Gale in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation would be ſplitting them upon a Rock, might well be expected to obſtruct, as far as they could, his Progreſs: But none do we hear of ſo impatient and clamorous againſt it as the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> For there had been now in <hi>England,</hi> about three Years, an Agent from <hi>Spain,</hi> named <hi>Diego Sarmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ento de Acuna,</hi> better known, but not till about the Time of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death, or perhaps after it, by the Title of Count <hi>de Gondomar;</hi> a Man, who, if he gain'd that Influence he did over King <hi>James</hi> pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Art, muſt be allowed a good Share of Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in the Myſteries of Negotiation; but as he
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:0181500200:439"/>
was adapted by Nature to ſooth and captivate him, no leſs than by the Pretenſions of his Agency, it diminiſhes the Wonders of his Succeſs in making that King ſuch a Subject to his Enchantments, and keeping him ſo many Years a <hi>Priſoner</hi> as it were in the <hi>Tower</hi> he had heap'd up of airy and glittering Promiſes: Yet what Reward was reſerved, for all his Services here, in his own Country, and how this ardent Slave to the Will and Pleaſure of his Maſter, was both Executioner of his Royal Pride as well as other Paſſions, and Sacrifice alſo at laſt to them, muſt be left for thoſe to diſplay who have more Leiſure to dilate upon ſuch Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence. This was the Man who (as he is repreſented in King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration) now <hi>took great Alarm, and is ſaid to have made loud and vehement Aſſertions to his Majeſty in repeated Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that he knew, and had diſcover'd the Intention and Enterprize of Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>to be but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile and piratical, tending to the Breach between the two Crowns, and the Danger and Deſtruction of the King his Maſter's Subjects in thoſe Parts; proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſort againſt it.</hi> To which that the King ſhould anſwer, (as it is there ſaid after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death) <hi>He would ſend Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>with a limited Commiſſion,</hi> (but how limited it was will ſoon appear) and that <hi>he durſt not upon Peril of his Head, do any ſuch Matter: and if he did, he would ſurely do Juſtice upon him, or ſend him bound Hand and Foot into</hi> Spain, <hi>with all the Gold and Goods he ſhould obtain by Robbery, and bring Home, were they never ſo great.</hi> Then the King by Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> got both a ſolemn Proteſtation from <hi>Ralegh,</hi> that he had no other Intention but only to go to thoſe Gold Mines; and alſo a cloſe Letter to his Majeſty (as it is here in his Declaration juſtly call'd) confirming the ſame.
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:0181500200:440"/>
This cloſe Letter was both written cloſe to the Purpoſe, or in ſuch expreſſive Terms as to have laid open the whole Scheme of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Voyage; and alſo as a Matter to be kept cloſe, or with the utmoſt Privacy; for 'tis ſaid, that upon ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, his Majeſty promiſed, <hi>on the Word of a King, to keep it ſecret:</hi> And it would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all Suppoſition of Diſingenuity, if this cloſe Letter had been fairly exhibited in that Declaration, had it been when this was penn'd, in the King's Poſſeſſion, as it ought according to his Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. On the contrary, this ſeems to have been the very Letter, by which, through the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Means, his Maſter the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was pre-admoniſh'd of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s whole Enterprize, and had ſent to <hi>Guiana,</hi> before he left the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Channel, to prepare a greater Force than his, to oppoſe him, as will hereafter appear. Nay, 'tis viſible by what immediately follows in the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, both that this cloſe Letter (how cloſely ſoever the Contents of it are with-held) did reveal the Particulars of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s naval Strength, and that the King did divulge it to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador; becauſe it was ſo far from making him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from his former Jealouſy, that he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to have objected thereupon againſt the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships <hi>Ralegh</hi> had prepared for the ſaid Voyage, to which <hi>Ralegh</hi> then doubtleſs made as proper Anſwer, as we ſhall find he did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But in ſhort ſuch a Propoſal, by one carrying the Reputation of ſuch an active, witty and valiant Gentleman, eſpecially of ſo great a Commander at Sea, as his Enemies allow he had; one who muſt be thought moſt wary above all others of incurring King <hi>James</hi>'s Diſpleaſure, under which he had ſo long ſuffer'd; one who had given ſuch publick Atteſtations of his Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:0181500200:441"/>
in the Proſecution of this Propoſal; and one who, as the greateſt Proof he could give thereof, was actually embarking his whole Fortune as well as Credit, together with thoſe of his Friends and Relations, all finding Security for their good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, without any Charge to the Crown if they fail'd, and with Proſpect of great Advantage if they ſucceeded, was ſo far from being overthrown by any Remonſtrances of the Ambaſſador himſelf, or from being thought a moſt noble and generous Overture by all other Men, that even the King's Honour is acknowledged, in his own Declaration, to have been engag'd, <hi>not to deny his People the Adventure and Hope of ſo great Riches.</hi> And yet what Character of that King's Honour towards his People, is expoſed in the ſame Leaf of that very Declaration, where it is pretended, that <hi>in his own Princely Judgment he gave no Belief to it,</hi> as being perſuaded that in Nature there were no ſuch Mines entire, or that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo induſtrious in the Chace of Treaſure, would have ſo long neglected the ſame; is left to the Reader's Diſtinction. But it may be beſt diſcover'd by the Care taken to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Majeſty's Dividend ſo clearly, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs many other Articles ſo doubtfully, in the Commiſſion itſelf, of which we ſhall now give an impartial Abſtract, whether it was from a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Principle or a mercenary one, from upright Policy or downright Prevarication, that the ſame was granted; being as fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>JAMES, by the Grace of God, &amp;c. To all to whom theſe Preſents ſhall come, &amp;c. Whereas Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> Knight, intendeth to undertake a Voyage by Sea and Shipping, to the South Parts of <hi>America</hi> or <hi>elſewhere</hi> within <hi>America,</hi> poſſeſs'd and inhabited by <hi>heathen</hi> and <hi>ſavage</hi> People, to diſcover ſome Commodities and Merchandize profitable for the

Subjects of our Kingdoms, whereof the Inhabitants make little or no Uſe; whence may enſue, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſome Propagation of the Chriſtian Faith and reformed Religion among thoſe idolatrous People: And whereas there are divers Merchants, &amp;c. well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aſſiſt Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> had they Aſſurance to enjoy their due Share of the Profits returned, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> being under the Peril of the Law; and whereas divers other Gentlemen, his Kinſmen and Friends, with ſeveral Captains and Commanders, are alſo deſirous to follow and venture their Lives with him, if they might be commanded by none but himſelf: We, upon deliberate Conſideration, deſiring the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of our <hi>Subjects,</hi> alſo to give our princely Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and his Friends, as well as to encourage others in the like <hi>laudable Enterpriſes,</hi> advance the Converſion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, and encreaſe Traffic by our Subjects of this Kingdom, have of our ſpecial Grace, &amp;c. granted Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> full Power to carry for the ſaid Voyage, ſo many of our Subjects, or others who will become our Subjects, as ſhall willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him; with ſufficient Shipping, Armour, Weapons, Ordnance, Munition, Powder, Shot, &amp;c. and all other Things as he ſhall think neceſſary for the Uſe and Defence of him and his Company; beſides Liberty to exchange or otherwiſe diſpoſe of his Goods or Merchandize; alſo to return into this or other of our Dominions with ſuch Gold, Silver, Bullion, or any other Wares, and they to be converted to the proper Uſe of the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and his Company; paying to us, our Heirs, &amp;c. the full fifth Part of all ſuch Gold and Silver, Bullion and Ore of Gold or Silver, Pearl or precious Stones, as ſhall be ſo imported; with all ſuch Cuſtoms, &amp;c. as ſhall be due for any other Goods whatever. Further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and the Adventurers,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:0181500200:443"/>
we promiſe <hi>in verbo Regio,</hi> that no Gold, Silver or other Wares by them imported from thoſe Parts ſo poſſeſs'd and inhabited; ſhall be ſeiz'd by us, our Heirs, or any of our Officers, but that it ſhall remain (the fifth Part of the ſaid Gold, Silver, Bullion, &amp;c. as before, with all other Cuſtoms and Duties being truly paid) to the ſole Uſe of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> and his Company. Further of our moſt ſpecial Grace, &amp;c. we conſtitute the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> to be the ſole Governor and Commander of all Perſons who ſhall travel or be with him in the ſaid Voyage or in their Return. And give him full Power to correct, puniſh, pardon, and rule them according to ſuch Orders and Inſtructions as the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> ſhall eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, as well in Caſes capital and criminal as civil, both marine and other; ſo that the ſaid Proceedings, as near as conveniently as may be, are agreeable to the Laws of this Realm, and to the Chriſtian Faith now profeſs'd in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſuch Enterprizes great Inconveniences have grown by Mutinies and Diſorders for Want of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authority, we give full Power to Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> in Caſe of Rebellion or Mutiny by Sea or Land, to exerciſe martial Law upon juſt and apparent Neceſſity, in as ample a Manner as our Lieutenant-General by Sea or Land, or our Lieutenants in the Counties of <hi>England.</hi> And we give Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> full Power to appoint ſuch Captains, and other Commanders and Miniſters under him, as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the better ordering and governing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. We further command the Wardens of the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> Cuſtomers and other Officers, quietly to permit Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> and all who ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture with him, to paſs to the ſaid <hi>South</hi> or other Parts of <hi>America,</hi> poſſeſs'd and inhabited as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and to return with any Goods whatever, and to ſell or otherwiſe diſpoſe of the ſame to the only Uſe

And theſe Preſents, &amp;c. ſhall be to the ſaid Wardens, &amp;c. ſufficient Warrant. And we grant to the ſaid Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh,</hi> that theſe our Letters Patents or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollment thereof, with all the Grants, Clauſes, &amp;c. therein, ſhall be ſufficient and effectual in Law, any Law, Statute, &amp;c. notwithſtanding. Witneſs our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the <hi>26</hi>th Day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the <hi>14</hi>th Year of our Reign of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>50</hi>th. <hi>Per breve de privato ſigillo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Abſtract is made from the ſaid Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as it is printed in King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration, and may agree with that which ſeems alſo to have been given us from the Records. Whether there was, originally, any Preamble to it we cannot ſay. But there are Authors who affirm, that in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion King <hi>James</hi> called him his Truſty and Well beloved Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> Tho' theſe may be Words of Courſe in ſuch like Inſtruments, yet if ſome Words were thus taken out in that Recital aforeſaid, it might give Reaſon of inferring that by the ſame Liberty others have been ſqueez'd in. Yet even as it is ſuffer'd there to appear, 'tis ſurely far from being ſo clearly penn'd in point of thoſe Limitations it is ſaid in his Majeſty's Declaration he promis'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador: For here is no Limitation to any Part of <hi>America,</hi> not only the <hi>South</hi> Parts but elſewhere being authoriz'd, and all that are habitable, inhabited in ſome Degree or other by Heathen and Savage People: So vague, ſo equivocal, and diſputable is that Diſtinction: Not one Word of <hi>Guiana,</hi> no owning of his own Right, or the Power he had lately given to plant there, no Privilege for working any Mine there, nor Prohibition to meddle with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0181500200:445"/>
Subjects there or elfewhere, as another Writer has well obſerv'd. On the contrary, full Liberty to carry what Arms and Ammunition they pleas'd for Defence, if they ſhould need it; and laſtly, the Royal Aſſurance of enjoying unmoleſted whatever they returned with. In ſhort, this Commiſſion muſt eaſily be obſerved to have been penn'd, how clearly ſoever pretended, as if King <hi>James</hi> did neither know of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Intention for and at <hi>Guiana;</hi> tho' a little before, he had the whole Particulars thereof from <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s own Hand, or that there were any <hi>Spaniards</hi> planted there; tho' he appears to have known that alſo from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador himſelf, whoſe own Kinſman, as we ſhall hear, was ſent, during <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, from <hi>Spain,</hi> to build and colonize upon that very Spot to which <hi>Ralegh</hi> had now this unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Commiſſion, as we may rather term it, to go. For 'tis ſo much the Reverſe of that cloſe penn'd Letter wherein <hi>Ralegh</hi> had, ſo expreſſively, and ſo unreſervedly, placed his whole Truſt of this Voyage in King <hi>James,</hi> that it ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, both to hoodwink the <hi>Spaniard</hi> till the Action was over, tho' the King betray'd it himſelf, and to ſecure Loop-holes ſufficient for the Royal Authority againſt his Exceptions; but they proved ſo large, that it was thought expedient, in the End, as we ſhall find, that the Commiſſion ſhould not be inſiſted on to limit or reſtrain any body.</p>
            <p>Whether this indiſtinct Power in that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made <hi>Ralegh</hi> more or leſs importunate for his Pardon, we cannot ſay. Some indeed write, that he laboured mainly to obtain it; but they are led into that Belief by the Declaration aforeſaid: Whereas we find it expreſly aſſerted in a Letter of <hi>Carew Ralegh</hi>'s; that his Father had Overtures made him of procuring his Pardon for 1500 <hi>l.</hi> by
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0181500200:446"/>
Sir <hi>William St. John,</hi> one of the Perſons of whom he purchas'd his Freedom, therefore one whoſe Intereſt was the leſs to be doubted in this Particular; but that Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> conferring, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Departure from <hi>England,</hi> with Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> (newly made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and not long after Lord Chancellor) upon this pecuniary Pardon, he poſitively adviſed <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> againſt it in theſe Words: <hi>Sir, the Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timber of your Voyage is Money; ſpare your Purſe in this Particular, for upon my Life, you have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pardon for all that is paſs'd already, the King having, under his Broad Seal, made you Admiral of your Fleet, and given you Power of the Martial Law over your Officers and Soldiers.</hi> But we are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where told, that even for leſs than half that Money beforemention'd, that is to ſay, <hi>for</hi> 700 <hi>l. the ſaid Sir</hi> William St. John, <hi>and alſo Sir</hi> Edward Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers <hi>(before ſpoken of) offer'd Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>not only his full Pardon, but Liberty not to go his Voyage if he pleas'd; and that he refus'd both; the rather becauſe he was told by Sir</hi> Francis Bacon <hi>(as above) that his ſaid Commiſſion was as good as a Pardon for all former Offences, as the Law of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>could afford him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, near ſeven Months after the Date of his Commiſſion, began his Fleet to appear, or rather that Part of it which lay in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and conſiſted of ſeven Sail. From the <hi>Survey</hi> which was taken thereof by the Appointment of <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> the Lord Admiral, on the 15th of <hi>March</hi> in the Year laſt named, it appears, that the firſt of them, or Admiral, a brave Ship, as deſcribed by one who might probably have ſeen it, and built by <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, was named the <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> of 440 Tons, and 36 Pieces (or more) of Ordnance; Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> General, and his
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0181500200:447"/>
Son <hi>Walter</hi> Captain: Beſides two hundred Men, whereof fourſcore were Gentlemen-Volunteers and Adventures, moſt of them Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Relations; which Number was afterwards increas'd. Second, The <hi>Jaſon</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> 240 Tons, and 25 Pieces of Ordnance; Captain <hi>John Pennington</hi> Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, fourſcore Men, one Gentleman and no more. Third, The <hi>Encounter,</hi> 160 Tons, 17 Pieces of Ordnance; <hi>Edward Haſtings</hi> Captain: (no Men more, except the Maſter, mentioned) but he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Indies,</hi> was ſucceeeded in the Command by Capt. <hi>Whitney. Fourth,</hi> The <hi>Thunder,</hi> 150 Tons, 20 Pieces of Ordnance; Sir <hi>Warham Sent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leger</hi> Captain, ſix Gentlemen, ſixty Soldiers, ten Land-men. Fifth, The <hi>Flying Joan,</hi> 120 Tons, 14 Pieces of Ordnance; <hi>John Chidley</hi> Captain, twenty-five Men. Sixth, The <hi>Southampton</hi> 80 Tons, ſix Pieces of Ordnance; <hi>John Bayley</hi> Captain, twenty-five Mariners, two Gentlemen. Seventh, The <hi>Page,</hi> a Pinnace, 25 Tons, three Rabnets of Braſs; <hi>James Barker</hi> Captain, eight Sailors. But before <hi>Ralegh</hi> left the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> he was joined by as many Ships more; ſo that his whole Fleet conſiſted of thirteen Sail, beſides his own Ship. And tho' we cannot be ſo particular in the remaining Part, we may yet learn thus much of it, that one Ship, named the <hi>Convertine,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Capt. <hi>Keymis;</hi> another, called the <hi>Confidence,</hi> was under the Charge of Capt. <hi>Woola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton;</hi> there was a Shallop, named the <hi>Flying Hart,</hi> under Sir <hi>John Ferne;</hi> two Flyboats under Capt. <hi>Sam. King,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Robert Smith;</hi> and a Carvel, with perhaps another named the <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> beſides.</p>
            <p>With the former Part of the Fleet <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſet ſail from the <hi>Thames</hi> on the 28th of <hi>March</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which was in the Year 1617, and was ſoon after ready to proceed at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> when
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0181500200:448"/>
ſeveral little Accidents fell out to retard his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; for he ſtay'd there ſome Days for Sir <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Sentleger,</hi> whoſe Ship, the <hi>Thunder,</hi> by the Negligence of her Maſter, was at Lee in the <hi>Thames:</hi> Alſo after <hi>Ralegh</hi> was got to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Capt. <hi>Pennington</hi> was not come to the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and when he did arrive, was forced to ride back to <hi>London</hi> to engage the Lady <hi>Ralegh</hi> to paſs her Word for the Money which was to redeem the Bread for his Ship, amounting to thirty Pounds, without which he could not have gone forward; nor could Sir <hi>John Ferne</hi> proceed till <hi>Ralegh</hi> had ſupply'd him with a hundred Pounds by his Couſin <hi>Herbert,</hi> and procur'd him another hundred Pounds of his Friend Dr. <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> having furniſh'd himſelf with a third hundred before he came from <hi>Wales. Ralegh</hi> tarried alſo for Capt. <hi>Whitney,</hi> who had a third Part of his Victuals to provide; and to aſſiſt him, <hi>Ralegh</hi> generouſly ſold his Plate at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> notwithſtanding which, and <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s having given him more Countenance than any other of his Officers, <hi>Whitney</hi> ran away from him at the <hi>Granadoes,</hi> and drew Capt. <hi>Woolaſton</hi> with his Ship after him: <hi>Ralegh</hi> had further the Patience to wait ten or twelve Days for Captain <hi>Bayley,</hi> which he afterwards ungratefully requited by deſerting alſo the Fleet at the <hi>Canaries,</hi> for no apparent Reaſon but <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s refuſing him a <hi>French</hi> Shallop he took in the Bay of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and yet after <hi>Ralegh</hi> had bought her for fifty Crowns, that the <hi>French</hi> might have no Cauſe of Complaint, <hi>Bayley</hi> might have had her if he had deſired it.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Scilly,</hi> in which Capt. <hi>Chidley</hi>'s Pinnace was ſunk, and Capt. <hi>King</hi> driven into <hi>Briſtol, Ralegh</hi> held it, from Experience as well as Reaſon, the Office of a Commander of many Ships, and thoſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sailings and Conditions, rather to take a Port, and keep his Fleet together, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the Loſs of his Maſts and Rigging, or the Advantage which Enemies might take, or the Loſs of more Time in attending another Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous, by the Danger of a Separation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he put into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was obliged to ſtay ſeven Weeks there; ſo that the Winds only were to be accuſed now (as he obſerves) for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. And here, tho' by his Credit he procured fifty Oxen, which he diſtributed among his Fleet, ſome of the Crew ſpared not, at his Return, to defame him with having taken Care to revictual himſelf and none of the reſt. On the 19th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he ſet forward from <hi>Cork.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he arriv'd at the Iſle of <hi>Lancerota,</hi> on the 6th of <hi>September, Ralegh</hi> ſent a Requeſt to the Governor, that he might be admitted to treat for ſome Proviſions: The Governor ſent back Word, that he would confer with <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, if he would come attended but by one Gentleman, and armed only with their Rapiers, <hi>Ralegh</hi> taking with him Lieutenant <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> met the Governor, who
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:0181500200:453"/>
agreed, that if he would ſend up an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factor, whoſe Ship then rode in the Road, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Iſland afforded ſhould be deliver'd at a reaſonable Rate. <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſent the Factor, but the Governor procraſtinated, and at laſt ſent Word, that unleſs he would embark his Men which lay on the Sea Shore, the Iſlanders were ſo jealous they durſt not divide from one another to ſupply him. <hi>Ralegh</hi> comply'd, but when half his Men were got aboard, the Iſlanders began to offer Violence upon the reſt. They ſlew one, and ſent the Factor to tell <hi>Ralegh,</hi> they would part with nothing to him, for that they believed his Company to be the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Fleet which had lately deſtroy'd <hi>Puerto Sancto.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> hereupon would have gone and helped themſelves, but <hi>Ralegh</hi> conſidering what Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it might give at home, how the Merchants might ſuffer, and the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factor be ruin'd, complained to the Governor of the <hi>Grand Canaries;</hi> of whom he alſo deſired Leave to take Water undiſturb'd; but inſtead of Anſwer, when he landed ſome hundred Men in the Deſart Part of the Iſland where they found freſh Water, there Ambuſh was laid, by which one of his Men was wounded to Death, and more had been ſlain, had not Captain <hi>Thornhuſt</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Hayman,</hi> two valiant Gentlemen, ſeconded by Sir <hi>Warham Sentleger</hi> and young Captain <hi>Ralegh,</hi> with half a dozen more, made forty of them run away. From this unavoidable Fray, <hi>Bayley</hi> found Pretence to turn Tail and go home again.</p>
            <p>In Want of Water they ſail'd to <hi>Gomera,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt and beſt defended of all theſe Iſlands, and the beſt Port. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being ſeated upon the very Waſh of the Sea, roughly ſaluted the Fleet at its firſt Entrance with their Cannon, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> returned their Salutation. But as
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:0181500200:454"/>
ſoon as <hi>Ralegh</hi> recover'd the Harbour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there ſhould be no more firing, he ſent a <hi>Spaniard</hi> he had with him aſhore, to aſſure the Governor he had no Intention to make War with any of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King's Subjects; and if any Harm had been done by his great Ordnance to the Town it was their Fault, who, by ſhooting firſt, gave the Occaſion. The Governor anſwer'd, he thought they had been the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet aforeſaid; but having been certified they were Chriſtians and <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and ſought nothing but Water, he was willing to let them take what they pleas'd, if he might be aſſur'd they would make no Attempt upon the Town Houſes, or their Gardens and Fruits. <hi>Ralegh</hi> reply'd, that he would give him his Faith, and the Word of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> his Sovereign, that if the People of the Town or Iſland ſhould loſe ſo much as an Orange or a Grape by any of his Men without paying for it, he would hang him up in the Market-place. And <hi>Ralegh</hi> kept his Men in ſuch good Diſcipline, that the Governor in divers Letters (for he wrote to him every Day) acknowledg'd how punctually <hi>Ralegh</hi> kept his Faith with him, in Regard to the inoffenſive Behaviour of his Company; and alſo how much himſelf was beholden to him for his particular Civilities. For his Counteſs, who was of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extract, being a <hi>Stafford</hi> by the Mother's Side, and of the Houſe of <hi>Horne</hi> by the Father, having ſent <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſome Preſents of Fruit, Sugar and Ruſk, he return'd others of greater Value. <note n="*" place="bottom">Tho' the Preſents <hi>Ralegh</hi> return'd to this Governor's Lady are not mentioned in his <hi>Apology,</hi> whence his Progreſs hitherto is chiefly extracted, I find in his own Journal aforeſaid of this Voyage, that they conſiſted of an Extract of Amber, Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeſe, a fine cut-work Ruff, a very excellent Picture of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and a good Quantity of Roſe-Water, which was of great Value and Eſteem in theſe Parts.</note>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:0181500200:455"/>
The Earl moreover gave him, at his Departure, on the 21ſt of <hi>September,</hi> a Letter to <hi>Don Diego Sarmiento</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying how honourably <hi>Ralegh</hi> had comported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Moriſco's</hi> in theſe <hi>Canary Iſlands</hi> dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourteeen Days that he was among them. Before he ſet Sail, he diſcharg'd a Bark of the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> taken by one of his Pinnaces, coming from <hi>Cape Blanc</hi> in <hi>Africa;</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that his Men had eaten of their Fiſh to the Value of ſix Ducats, <hi>Ralegh</hi> gave them eight.</p>
            <p>After having weather'd through a violent Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane and ſome vaſt Showers of Rain, beſides Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers no leſs fearful within; Sickneſs now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to viſit his Ship, he arriv'd on the 2d of <hi>October</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Bravo:</hi> And here underwent great Hazards and Hardſhips; beſide the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs daily ſpreading among his Men. For whereas all thoſe who navigated even between <hi>Cape de Vert</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> were wont to paſs between fifteen and twenty Days at moſt, he found the Wind ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him, and indeed to Nature, ſo many Storms and Showers, that he ſpent near ſix Weeks in the Paſſage from hence; by reaſon whereof, and the burning Heat of the Climate, he was in great Diſtreſs for Water. Here loſing Anchors, Cables and Water-caſk, beſides two more of his Company, he was driven after two Days, by a Kind of <hi>Turnado,</hi> from this Iſland; which, as well as the others he touch'd at, before mention'd, he has well deſcrib'd in his Journal of this unfortunate Voyage. After his Return home, Detraction did not ſpare to give out, that he went to <hi>Cape de Vert</hi> knowing it to be infected, and thereby loft many of his Men; whereas he was 160 Leagues from that <hi>Cape,</hi> according to his own Account, in his Apology; and had threeſcore Men ill in his own
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0181500200:456"/>
Ship before he came to <hi>Bravo,</hi> as we find it in his Journal; tho' if he had gone to that <hi>Cape</hi> now, after the Rains which had fallen, there had been little Danger of any ſuch Infection. All Places that lie near great Rivers, in low and mooriſh Grounds, do indeed, as he rightly obſerves, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their Inhabitants to Fevers and Agues; as even along both Sides of our own River <hi>Thames;</hi> and other Infection is not found either in the <hi>Indies</hi> or in <hi>Africa,</hi> except when the eaſterly Wind or Breezes are excluded and kept off by ſome high Mountains from the Valleys, whereby the Air wanting Motion, ſtagnates, and becomes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly unhealthful, as at <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and ſome other Places. But, ſays he, <hi>as good Succeſs admits of no Examination, ſo the contrary allows of no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence they proceeded, on the 4th of <hi>October,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Guiana.</hi> But the Sickneſs reviſited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd many of thoſe whom the Storms ſpared, carrying off Numbers of his ableſt Men both for Sea and Land, no leſs than forty-two of his own Ship ending their Voyage with their Lives, moſtly in this Month, at leaſt before they reach'd the Coaſt. About the 12th of the ſame Month, when their Sickneſs began to be at the Height, and they at the greateſt Diſtance from any Shore, they were many other Ways alſo diſtreſs'd; for when they began to be in Scarcity of Water, they were alſo becalm'd; yet ever threatned with Extremity of tempeſtuous Weather, from the ſtrange and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Alterations in the Atmoſphere. One while the Horizon muffled as it were in ſuch thick and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Darkneſs, that they were forced to ſteer a Day or two by Candle-light. At other Times, arched and overſhot with gloomy Diſcolorations; ſo that watery Rainbows were continually invading their
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0181500200:457"/>
Eyes, or heavy Showers their Bodies, and dead Calms retarding their Ships. Afterwards at <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad, Ralegh</hi> obſerv'd, beſides two Water-galls, no leſs than fifteen Rainbows in one Day, and one of them bent as it were both Ends together, making a perfect Circle; and theſe were ever followed with wet Weather; for as he alſo noted, eſpecially of the Morning Rainbow, it did not here produce a fair Day, as in <hi>England.</hi> But one good Effect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd, that when their Water was ſo ſcarce, near the latter End of this Month, that the Ship's Crew was reduced to half Allowance, they ſaved ſome Hogheads, which fell from the Clouds, and all quenched their Thirſt with great Cans of this bitter Draught, as <hi>Ralegh</hi> deſcribes that Rain Water to have been. On the laſt Day of this Month, as he was raiſed abruptly out of his Bed in a Sweat, by the Noiſe which a ſudden great Guſt had occaſion'd in his Ship, he got a Cold, which turned to a burning Fever, and caſt him down for twenty Days together; in which Time he receiv'd no other Suſtenance than a few ſtew'd Prunes, but Drink, every Hour, both Day and Night; and ſweated ſo exceſſively, that he was forced to ſhift three Times every Day, and as often at Night. At laſt the Violence of his Diſeaſe was abated, by the Oranges and other Fruits he had received at <hi>Gomera</hi> of the Governor's Lady; which he had carefully preſerved in Sand to his great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; and without which, as he owns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he could not have lived: But it was double the Time before he could recover in any tollerable Degree from this ſharp Viſitation.</p>
            <p>In this ſlow and ſickly Manner they arrived at laſt, on the 11th of <hi>November,</hi> at the North Cape of <hi>Wiapoco.</hi> And here <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſent for his old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>Leonard</hi> the <hi>Indian,</hi> who had been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="448" facs="tcp:0181500200:458"/>
three or four Years with him; but he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd ſo far up in the Country, there was no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him. Therefore he ſtood away for <hi>Caliana,</hi> which is in 5 Degrees on the Coaſts of <hi>Guiana,</hi> at the firſt Diſcovery call'd Port <hi>Howard,</hi> where the Caſſique was alſo his Servant, and had lived with him in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> two Years. There he arrived in a Day or two, having paſſed the Iſland noted for its Multitude of Birds and Silk-bearing Trees, and from thence ſent for his Servant <hi>Harry,</hi> the <hi>Indian,</hi> who, with other Caſſiques, came and brought him great Store of <hi>Caſſavi</hi> Bread and roaſted Mullets, with Plantanes, Pinas, Piſtacias, &amp;c. But <hi>Ralegh</hi> ventured not to eat of the Pinas, which tempted him exceedingly, till after a Day or two's airing on the Shore in a Tent which was there pitch'd for him; then he alſo eat ſome Armadillo and a little Pork, and began to gather Strength. Here alſo he landed his ſick Men, and recovered many; and here he buried Captain <hi>Edward Haſtings</hi> (the Lord <hi>Huntington</hi>'s Brother) who died ten Days or more before, and with him his Serjeant Major, <hi>Hart,</hi> and Captain <hi>Henry Snedale;</hi> the Charge of whoſe Ship <hi>Ralegh</hi> gave to his Servant Captain <hi>Robert Smith</hi> of <hi>Cornwall.</hi> Here he alſo ſet up his Barges and Shallops which they brought from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in Quarters, cleanſed his Ships, trim'd up his Caſks, and ſupply'd them with Water; fix'd up a Forge, and made ſuch Iron Works as they wanted. Thus on that Shore, and this River they employed and refreſh'd themſelves for about three Weeks; during which Time, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was very much careſs'd by the <hi>Indians</hi> of his old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance aforeſaid, and the other Natives of this Place, who cheriſhed him daily with the beſt Proviſions that the Country yielded, and offer'd him all Kind of Obedience, even to the making him their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign

Prince and Ruler, if he would abide and ſettle among them; ſo freſh continued his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and ſuch unanimous Impreſſions of Homage and Reſpect had his former Behaviour ſtill left upon them; which Offer he mentions with the greateſt Modeſty and Indifference in the Diſpatch he now ſent to <hi>England.</hi> For in this Interval, Captain <hi>Peter Alley,</hi> one of his Company, who was much troubled with a vertiginous Diſorder in his Head, having got Leave to return home, and the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel which lay there, <hi>Ralegh</hi> among other Letters, ſent one by him to his Lady, dated from <hi>Caliana</hi> the 14th of <hi>November. Herein,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I cannot write to you but with a weak Hand, for I have ſuffered the moſt violent Calenture for fifteen Days that ever Man did, and lived; but God that gave me a ſtrong Heart in all my Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, has alſo now ſtrengthned me in the Hell-fire of Heat. We had two moſt grievous Sickneſſes in our Ship, of which forty-two have died, and there are yet many ſick; but having recover'd the Land of</hi> Guiana <hi>this</hi> 12<hi>th of</hi> November, <hi>I hope we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them. We are yet two hundred Men, and the reſt of our Fleet are reaſonably ſtrong, ſtrong enough I hope to perform what we have undertaken, if the diligent Care at</hi> London <hi>to make our Strength known to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>King by his Ambaſſador, has not taught the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>King to fortify all the Entrances againſt us. Howſoever, we muſt make the Adventure, and if we periſh, it ſhall be no Honour for</hi> England, <hi>nor Gain for his Majeſty, to loſe, among many others, an hundred as valiant Gentlemen as</hi> England <hi>hath in it.</hi> Then having ſpoken of <hi>Bayley</hi>'s running away from him, the unnatural Weather they had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd through, and their tedious Paſſage, with the Preſent of Fruits which had ſo much relieved him, as is before obſerved, beſides the Death of
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0181500200:460"/>
ſome principal Officers, and Recommendation of himſelf to ſome Friends in <hi>London,</hi> eſpecially his Son <hi>Carew,</hi> he concludes thus: <hi>To tell you that I might be here King of the</hi> Indians <hi>were a Vanity; but my Name hath ſtill liv'd among them; here they feed me with freſh Meat, and all that the Country yields: All offer to obey me.</hi> At this Time alſo, a Gentleman of his Company having drawn up a Diſcourſe in Praiſe of <hi>Guiana,</hi> and in Honour of this Adventure; eſpecially of the principal Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, it being dated from <hi>Calia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na November</hi> the 17th, ſent it alſo into <hi>England</hi> by the ſame Bearer, and it was printed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Year.</p>
            <p>On the 4th of <hi>December</hi> they left this River, and came next Day to the <hi>Triangle Iſlands;</hi> but were all in Danger of leaving their Bones upon the Sholes before they got thither. For they were laid aground, eſpecially <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s larger Ship, for the Space of twenty-four Hours or more; and had it not been fair Weather, would never have got off the Coaſt, having not above two Fathom of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Here, after a few Days, when all the Fleet was gather'd together, it being conſider'd in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſultation, that <hi>Rolegh</hi> himſelf who had grappled with the Sickneſs for ſix Weeks, and was now rather ſo much relaps'd than recover'd, that he could not move otherwiſe than as he was carried in a Chair, they reſolved that there was no Thoughts of his undertaking the Paſſage up the <hi>Orenoque</hi> in Perſon. And further, though they could never underſtand by <hi>Keymis,</hi> who was the firſt of any Nation that had entered the main Mouth of that River, nor by any of their Mariners, who had traded there many Years for Tobacco, what Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty the Water was of; yet having found by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Ships at eleven Foot Water, lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0181500200:461"/>
three Days in paſſing up; therefore there was no attempting it with <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship, which being heavier, and charged with near forty Pieces of Ordnance, drew ſeventeen Foot. Nor would his Son with the reſt have ventured, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they had, through any other Perſon's Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Reſolution of ſtaying to relieve them at a Place appointed, againſt the Forces expected to approach, but that of his Father and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. So it was reſolved by all, that the five larger Ships ſhould ride at <hi>Punta de Gallo</hi> in <hi>Trinidad</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Ralegh</hi> to ſecure their Retreat, and the five leſſer (for this was now the whole Number of his Fleet) with five or ſix Foot Companies of fifty Men each, ſhould enter the River. According to this Determination, the Fleet was here divided; that is to ſay, Captain <hi>Whitney</hi> in the <hi>Encounter; Woolaſton</hi> in the <hi>Confidence; King</hi> in the <hi>Supply; Smith</hi> in a Pink, and <hi>Hall</hi> in a Carvel. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies had for their Leaders, Captain <hi>Charles Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and Captain <hi>North</hi> (Brothers to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> and the Lord <hi>North;)</hi> young <hi>Ralegh;</hi> Captain <hi>Thornhurſt</hi> of <hi>Kent;</hi> Captain <hi>Pennington</hi>'s Lieutenant, who ſeems to be another <hi>Hall,</hi> and Captain <hi>Chidley</hi>'s Lieutenant, <hi>Prideux.</hi> Sir <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham St. Leger, Ralegh</hi>'s Lieutenant, who had the Charge of theſe Companies, fell ſick at <hi>Caliana;</hi> ſo it was confer'd on <hi>George Ralegh,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Nephew, who had ſerved with great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> and Captain <hi>Keymis</hi> had the chief Charge for their Guidance and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the River. But <hi>Keymis</hi> having laid down the Plan of his intended Attempt upon the Mine, and undertaken to diſcover it with ſix or eight Perſons in Sir <hi>John Ferne</hi>'s Shallop, <hi>Ralegh,</hi> upon Conſideration, diſliking that Method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:0181500200:462"/>
determined to alter it, and therefore gave him his Inſtructions in the following Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keymis,</hi> Whereas you were reſolv'd, after your Arrival into the <hi>Oronoque,</hi> to paſs to the Mine with my Couſin <hi>Herbert</hi> and ſix Musketiers, and to that End deſired to have Sir <hi>John Ferne</hi>'s Shallop; I do not allow of that Courſe; becauſe you cannot land ſo ſecretly, but that ſome <hi>Indians</hi> on the River ſide may diſcover you, who giving Knowledge thereof to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> you may be cut off before you reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Boat. I therefore adviſe you to ſuffer the Captains and Companies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to paſs up weſtward of the Mountain <hi>Aio,</hi> from whence you have no leſs than three Miles to the Mine, and to encamp between the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Town and you, if there is any Town near it; that being ſo ſecured, you may make Trial what Depth and Breadth the Mine holds, and whether or no it will anſwer our Hopes. And if you find it royal, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> begin to war upon you, then let the Serjeant-major repel them, if it is in his Power, and drive them as far as he can: but if you find the Mine is not ſo rich as to perſuade the holding of it, and it requires a ſecond Supply, then ſhall you bring but a Basket or two to ſatisfy his Majeſty that my Deſign was not imaginary but true, though not anſwerable to his Majeſty's Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Quantity of which I never gave Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor could. On the other Side, if you ſhall find any great Number of Soldiers are newly ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Orenoque,</hi> as the Caſſique of <hi>Caliana</hi> told us there were, and that the Paſſages are already enforc'd, ſo as without manifeſt Peril of my Son, yourſelf and the other Captains, you cannot paſs towards the Mine; then be well adviſed how you land, for I know (that a few Gentlemen excepted) what a Scum of Men you have, and I would not for all the World, receive a Blow from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to the Diſhonour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:0181500200:463"/>
I myſelf, for my Weakneſs, cannot be preſent, neither will the Company land except I abide by the Ships, the Galleons of <hi>Spain</hi> being daily expected. <hi>Piggot</hi> the Serjeant major is dead, Sir <hi>Warham St. Leger,</hi> my Lieutenant, without Hope of Life, and my Nephew, <hi>George Ralegh,</hi> your Serjeant-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, now, but a young Man: it is therefore on your Judgment that I rely; who, I truſt, God will direct for the beſt. Let me hear from you as ſoon as you can. You ſhall find me at <hi>Punta de Gallo</hi> dead or alive; and if you find not my Ships there, yet there you ſhall find their Aſhes; for I will fire with the Galleons if it come to Extremity, but run away I will never.</p>
            <p>With theſe Inſtructions thoſe five Ships ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, parting from <hi>Ralegh</hi> and the reſt of the Fleet at the Iſlands aforeſaid, with a Month's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, on the 10th of <hi>December.</hi> But when they found a new <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Town, called <hi>St. Thome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about 140 Houſes; though lightly built, with a Chapel, a Convent of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> and a Garriſon erected on the main Channel of the <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noque,</hi> about Twenty Miles diſtant from the Place where <hi>Antonio Berreo,</hi> the Governor taken by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> in his firſt Diſcovery and Conqueſt here, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to plant; <hi>Keymis</hi> and the reſt thought themſelves oblig'd, through Fear of leaving the Enemy's Garriſon between them and their Boats, to deviate from their Inſtructions, which enjoin'd them, firſt to carry a little Party to make Trial of the Mine, under a Shelter of their own Camp; and then to deal with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Town as it ſhould give Cauſe, by permitting or offering to prevent them. So they concluded to land in one Body, and encamp between the Mine and the Town; whereby, though themſelves were ſomething ſtronger, their Boats were ſubject to the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0181500200:464"/>
and the Mine left untry'd contrary to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Order. For, about three Weeks after their Departure, landing, by Night, it ſeems, nearer the Town than they ſuſpected, and meaning to reſt themſelves on the River-ſide till morning, they were, in the Night-time, ſet upon by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, appriz'd of, and forearm'd for their coming, as we ſhall ſee. This Charge was ſo unexpected, and ſtruck the common Soldiers with ſuch Amazement and Confuſion, that had not the Captains and ſome other valiant Gentlemen made head, and animated the reſt, they had all been cut to pieces. But the reſt, by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſoon rallying, made ſuch a vigorous Defence againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they drove them to a Retreat, till in the Warmth of their Purſuit, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found themſelves at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew where they were. Here the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was renewed afreſh upon them, being aſſaulted by the Governor himſelf <hi>Don Diego Palameca,</hi> and four or five Captains at the Head of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; againſt whom, Captain <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> a brave and ſprightly young Man, now twenty-three Years of Age, but fonder of Glory than Safety, not tarrying for the Musketiers, ruſh'd foremoſt, at the Head of a Company of Pikes, and having killed one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captains, was himſelf ſhot by another; but preſſing ſtill forward, with his Sword upon <hi>Erinetta,</hi> probably the Captain who had ſhot him, this <hi>Spaniard</hi> with the Butt-end of his Musket fell'd him to the Ground, and after theſe Words, <note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis ſaid in King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration, p. 34, that young <hi>Ralegh,</hi> likelieſt to know his Father's Secret, when he led his Soldiers upon this Town us'd theſe or the like Words, <hi>Come on my Hearts, here is the Mine that we muſt expect, they that look for any other Mine are Fools.</hi> As if <hi>Ralegh</hi> was at ſo much Toil, Hazard and Expence only to break the Peace, and drive a Pack of poor <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of a worthleſs Town. Nor does it ſeem likely, that if young <hi>Ralegh</hi> knew this to be his Father's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, that he would thus diſcloſe it; but rather if he did utter ſuch an Expreſſion, that he ſuddenly invented it to give his Men Hopes of Booty, knowing that would beſt excite them to Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note>
               <hi>Lord have mercy upon me, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:0181500200:465"/>
               <hi>your Enterprize,</hi> young <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſpoke no more. Hereupon <hi>John Pleſſington,</hi> his Serjeant, thruſt the ſaid <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain through the Body with his Halbert. Two Commanders more of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were at the ſame Time ſlain, one by <hi>John of Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> another of young <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Company: And laſtly the Governor himſelf alſo loſt his Life in the ſaid Engagement; which happened, as <hi>Camden</hi> reckons, the ſecond of <hi>January.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Leaders being thus all diſpatch'd, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Soldiers, the reſt fled and were diſpers'd, ſome to ſhelter about the Market place, from whence they kill'd and wounded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at Pleaſure; ſo as they ſaw no Way left to be ſafe, but by firing the Town about their Ears, and driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Woods and Mountains, whence they ſtill kept the <hi>Engliſh</hi> waking with perpetual Alarms. Others were more careful to defend the Paſſages to their Mines, of which they had three or four not far diſtant, than they had been to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Town itſelf. But for the Magazine of Tobacco, which one Writer, among other erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Repreſentations of this Voyage, thought might countervail the Charge of it, could it with ſome other Things have been preſerved, it ſeems not to have been conſumed by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> becauſe <hi>Ralegh</hi> had enough thereof ſoon after to have paid for the victualling of his Fleet, if there had been Occaſion, as himſelf has related.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="456" facs="tcp:0181500200:466"/>
               <hi>All Obſtructions ſeeming thus removed, Capt.</hi> Keymis <hi>had now a fair Opportunity to make what Trial he pleas'd at the Mine; and that he did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Diſcovery will appear by the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as his Preparations do in the Letter he wrote to</hi> Ralegh <hi>ſix Days after the Action afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, tho' it came not long after to his Hands. Herein having open'd, in as gradual and diſcreet a Manner as he could, how gallantly his Son fell in this Exploit, and obſerved, that if</hi> his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Valour and Vigour of Mind had not led them all on, it had never been attempted, nor performed as it was, to his ſurviving Honour; <hi>having alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,</hi> that, four of the beſt Houſes in Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Refiners; tho' he had ſeen no Coin or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, but only a little Plate; <hi>he adds,</hi> Now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, God willing, to viſit the Mine, not eight Miles from the Town; ſooner I could not go by Reaſon of the Murmurings, the Diſcords and Vexations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Serjeant-Major is perpetually tormented. <hi>Concluding with theſe Words,</hi> I have ſent your Lordſhip a Parcel of ſcatter'd Papers, and reſerve a Cart-load; one Roll of Tobacco, one Tortoiſe, with ſome Oranges and Lemons; praying God to give you Strength and Health of Body, and a Mind armed againſt all Extremities. I reſt ever to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this <hi>8</hi>th of <hi>January, 1617,</hi> your Lordſhip's, <hi>Keymis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Ralegh</hi> had need of thoſe Prayers, on his own Part, at this Time, not only in his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but even in the Intervals he had of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; for here to give ſome Account of him in this Time of Separation, we may obſerve, that he lay with the five larger Ships under himſelf, Capt. <hi>John Pennington,</hi> his Vice-Admiral, one of the moſt ſufficient Gentlemen for the Sea, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has, ſays he; Sir <hi>Warham St. Leger,</hi> another
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0181500200:467"/>
valiant and worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>John Ferne,</hi> and Captain <hi>Chidley</hi> of <hi>Devon,</hi> moſtly at <hi>Punta de Gallo,</hi> and other Ports about <hi>Trinidad,</hi> no leſs than a hundred and fifty Miles from the reſt of his Fleet, making the Adventure up the <hi>Oronoque,</hi> yet in daily Apprehenſions of meeting with the <hi>Spaniſh Armada,</hi> ſent purpoſely to lay wait for and deſtroy him; which it would probably have done, after the great Sickneſs which had ſo much weakned his Men, and under this diſadvantageous Diviſion of his Ships, but that the Enemy luckily waited for him in a wrong Place. Beſides, it having been falſly rumour'd in his Fleet, that he brought out of <hi>England</hi> twenty-two thouſand Broad-pieces of Gold with him, ſome of his Crew traiterouſly conſpir'd to ſail away, while he was gone aſhore in his Barge, to take Views and make Diſcoveries of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which he was ſometimes wont to do, as at <hi>Terra de Brea,</hi> or the <hi>Pitch-land,</hi> as he calls it, from the bitumenous Subſtance which ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly iſſues there, as he has well deſcrib'd; and when he travers'd ſome Woods to ſeek the Trees that yield that precious Balſam whereof he got a ſmall Quantity, which ſmelt like Angelica; ſo to have left him a Prey to Famine, wild Beaſts, or the no leſs unmerciful <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whom he might have been flea'd alive, as other <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who came but to traffick, had formerly been. Add to this the many Provocations he received from the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who were in any of the Ports where his Men landed, only to exchange a few Commodities for Tobacco or other Products of the Country, not only by the moſt opprobrious Language, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging ſometimes a Volley of twenty Muſkets at a Time upon them, whereby Sir <hi>John Ferne</hi> had ſome of his Men kill'd. And laſtly, the Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he was continually in, that he could hear no
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:0181500200:468"/>
Tidings of the reſt of his Fleet thus detach'd upon the Adventure. And tho' ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Spies were brought to him in the Beginning of <hi>February,</hi> by one of whom, who could ſpeak the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue, he was firſt informed, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Orenoque,</hi> were reported, by ſome <hi>Tivitivas</hi> he had ſpoken with, to have taken <hi>St. Thome,</hi> and ſlain <hi>Diego de Palameca</hi> the Governor, with Captain <hi>Erinetta,</hi> and Captain <hi>John Rues;</hi> that the reſt fied, and that two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captains were likewiſe kill'd: Tho' the ſame was ſoon after alſo aſſerted, with other Particulars, by another <hi>Indian;</hi> yet <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> would not ſet them down, till he knew the Truth; which afterwards endeavouring to compaſs of other <hi>Indians,</hi> ſaid to have been at the Taking of that Town, whom he ſent in Purſuit of, they eſcaped, and he was not certified in the Report, even near the middle of this Month, for ſo far his own Journal extends.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Keymis</hi> made an Attempt for the Mine, and had ſet forward with Captain <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>W. Herbert,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hamden</hi> and others; but at their firſt Approach, near the Bank where they intended to land, he received, from an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade of <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Woods (who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gather'd there with Expectation of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that Way to the Mine) a Volley of Shot, which ſlew two of his Company, hurt ſix others, and wounded Captain <hi>Thornhurſt</hi> ſo dangerouſly in the Head, that he languiſh'd thereof three Months after. This Blow firſt ſtagger'd the Reſolution of <hi>Keymis,</hi> who then, as he reflected more upon the State of their Condition, was more over-power'd with Doubts and Diſcouragements; inſomuch that though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under him might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of two or three Mines more, beſide this which <hi>Keymis</hi> had undertaken to lead them to, by
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0181500200:469"/>
a <hi>Mulatto,</hi> who had waited on the late Governor in his Chamber, and, as he has written in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beforemention'd, knew all Things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd his Maſter. This Servant, afterwards, by no other Means than courteous Uſage, diſcover'd the ſame to <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf; and not only the Places where thoſe Mines lay, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that two of them, Gold ones, were in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Don Pedro Rodrigo de Parama,</hi> and <hi>Hermian Frontino;</hi> and a Silver one, in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Franciſco Faſardo;</hi> and that the Cauſe of their remaining unwrought was, that they wanted Negroes to work them: for, by a Law of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, the <hi>Indians</hi> could not be conſtrain'd, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> neither would nor could endure the Labour. Yet did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now decline all Endeavour, either to be directed to theſe, though but few Miles diſtant from the Town, or proceed to poſſeſs that which <hi>Keymis</hi> was to conduct them to, though within a few Hours March. Nay, when the Ships were upon their Return, and they had ſailed down the River as far as the Country of <hi>Carapana,</hi> one of the natural Lords, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that Part of <hi>Guiana</hi> to the late Queen; and, having heard that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had abandon'd <hi>St. Thome,</hi> and left no Forces, as he hop'd they would have done, had ſent a great Canoe, laden with Store of Fruits and Proviſions, to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; alſo by one of his Men, who had learn'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue during his long Slavery under the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had offer'd them a rich Gold Mine in his own Country, to engage their Stay; further proffering to leave ſufficient Pledge for any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Perſon they ſhould ſend to examine it; and, when Captain <hi>Leak</hi> with another of the Company, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Molineux,</hi> offer'd themſelves to go, the greater Part nevertheleſs refus'd to ſuffer them. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0181500200:470"/>
of his Offer, ſo heightned <hi>Carapana</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make it acceptable, that he ſent again, leaving one of his Men ſtill aboard, who entreated to detain them but two Days, and <hi>Carapana</hi> would himſelf, aged as he was, bring them a Sample of the Ore; who, though ſtill rejected, and the Ships under Sail, yet ſent once more a Boat after them up to the Mouth of the River, in hopes to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laſt of retrieving them, as the ſaid Captain <hi>Leak, Parker, Molineux,</hi> and half a dozen Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers more, are, by <hi>Ralegh,</hi> nominated to atteſt. But the Adventurers, among other Diſſuaſives from all Temptation to continue there any longer, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd a Notion that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſecretly agreed with, and employ'd thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> only to trepan the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which appear'd but a weak and ill-grounded Apprehenſion to <hi>Ralegh;</hi> for ſuch Treachery might have been eaſily prevented, had they waited the Arrival of the old <hi>Indian</hi> Chief, who would have brought the Ore to their very Ships. And what Advantage in betraying them, ſays he, could there be, when the <hi>Guianians</hi> offered to leave Hoſtages, ſix for one? Moreover, one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found in Fetters when they took <hi>St. Thome,</hi> and brought with them aboard, could have told them, that the very Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique, who ſent to ſhew them the Gold Mine in his Country, was unconquer'd and at Enmity with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and could have aſſur'd them withal, that ſuch Mines were in that Country poſſeſs'd by the ſaid Caſſique. But no Intreaty or Invitation would retain them, and ſo they return'd, about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> to <hi>Punta de Gallo,</hi> after the Fleet had been thus divided, and they abſent above two Months from Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> as himſelf has informed us; whereby it appears. that the Fleet united at, or very ſoon after, the Time he
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:0181500200:471"/>
diſcontinued his Journal; and it appears no where in that Journal, that any inhuman Offer was made to remove from <hi>Punta de Gallo</hi> to the <hi>Charibees,</hi> many Leagues off, where he knew Famine muſt over-take the Land Soldiers before they could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, as his Enemies ſuggeſted: beſides, he cleared himſelf in ſuch a ſolemn Manner of this Aſperſion at his Death, as leaves not the leaſt Stain of Cruelty any where but upon their Characters who ſlander'd him with it.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible that <hi>Keymis</hi> might, at his firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, be favourably received, and ss familiarly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Table as before; for a Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of this Conſequence was not to be too readily broach'd on one Side, nor reprehended on the other. Beſides, as ſome Mitigation of their ill Succeſs, and Inducement to further Hopes, <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> produced two Ingots of Gold which had been reſerved at <hi>St. Thome,</hi> as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Quota, or Proportion; together with ſeveral other valuable Spoils of the Governor. <hi>Keymis</hi> alſo brought with him a large Quantity of Papers, Letters, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, Schemes, Plans and Maps found in the ſaid Governor's Study; which gave ſome ſingular Lights into the State and Condition of <hi>Spain,</hi> with Reſpect to many of the <hi>American</hi> Plantations. Among theſe Papers were found four Letters, which plainly diſcover'd, not only <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s whole Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to have been betray'd, but his Life thereby put into the Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves; <note n="*" place="bottom">The King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s firſt Letter, ſent to <hi>Guiana</hi> by a Bark of <hi>Aviſo,</hi> to arm the <hi>Indians</hi> againſt <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Coming, was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 19 <hi>March</hi> 1616, at <hi>Madrid</hi> (which Letter, ſays <hi>Ralegh,</hi> in his to Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> I have, here encloſed, ſent you, the reſt I reſerve; not knowing whether they may be intercepted or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) The ſecond of that King's was dated 2d of <hi>May</hi> 1617, ſent alſo by a Caravel to <hi>Diego de Palameca,</hi> Governpr of <hi>Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, El Dorado</hi> and <hi>Trinidad.</hi> The third of his Majeſty's, was ſent by the Biſhop of <hi>Puerto Rico,</hi> and delivered to ihat Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the 15th of <hi>July</hi> following: and the fourth was ſent from the Farmer and Secretary of his Cuſtoms in the <hi>Indies</hi> at the ſame Time.

and by whom, even to the Breaking of that Peace, if any was broken, for which he was afterwards exclaim'd againſt. <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf has related: <note n="*" place="bottom">Though <hi>Ralegh</hi> his charged this Matter of betraying him to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in plain Terms, both in his Letter to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, which follows as above, and in his Apology; one, or both of which King <hi>James</hi> had certainly read, it is yet obſervable, that this Topic is not ſo much as touch'd upon in his Majeſty's Declaration, but entirely ſunk in Silence.</note>for he thought this ſuch black and cruel Uſage, that he forbore not, in a Letter which he wrote, about a Month after this Time, from the Iſle of St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s, to Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, to ſhew his Senſe of it in theſe Words: <hi>It pleaſed his Majeſty to value us at ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as to command me, upon my Allegiance, to ſet down under my Hand, the Country and the very Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by which I was to enter it; to ſet down the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Men, and Burden of my Ships, and what Ordnance every Ship carried; which being made known to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Ambaſſador, and by him ſent to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>a Diſpatch was made and Letters</hi>

               <hi>ſent from</hi> Madrid <hi>before my Departure out of the</hi> Thames. By the Contents of thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it further appears, that three hundred <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers, and ten Pieces of Ordnance, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to be ſent from their reſpective Garriſons againſt, the Adventurers up the <hi>Orenoque;</hi> that is, a hundred and fifty Men from <hi>Nuevo Reyno de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>Antonio Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica;</hi> and another hundred and fifty from <hi>Puerto Rico,</hi> to be conducted under <hi>Franciſco Zanchio.</hi> There was alſo prepared an <hi>Armada</hi> by Sea, to ſet upon <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf and the Ships with him; <hi>by which, ſays he, we had not only been torn to pieces, but all thoſe in the River had alſo periſhed, they being of no force for the Sea Fight; for we had reſolved to have burnt by their Sides, and to have died there, had the</hi> Armada <hi>arriv'd; but, belike, they ſtay'd for us at</hi> Margarita, <hi>by which they knew we muſt paſs towards the</hi> Indies. In another Letter, which he wrote the next Day from the ſame Iſland to his Wife, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſays, <hi>Never was poor Man expoſed to Slaughter as I was.</hi> Then having related the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Forces beforemention'd, ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, through the Communication of his Scheme to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, he concludes this Part with theſe Words: <hi>It were too long to tell you how we were preſerved; if I live, I ſhall make it known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Indignation which <hi>Ralegh</hi> muſt have conceived at the Sight of theſe Letters, was not a little heightned, when he came to hear that <hi>Keymis</hi> had made no actual Trial at the Mine, and the Reaſons he gave for having relinquiſh'd it. He alledg'd indeed, that after the Salley of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> upon them from the woody Banks, which had diſabled ſeveral of his Men at their firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to land, he began to conſider, they had not
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0181500200:474"/>
then able Men enough left to work the Mine; though indeed, it lay not ſo deep, as to need all thoſe Pioneers and Implements, which, in King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration, <hi>Ralegh</hi> is objected againſt for not carrying with him, as may appear by the firſt Diſcovery of this Mine, in the former Part of theſe Sheets. <hi>Keymis</hi> alſo argued, they had not Men enough to keep this Mine, though they ſhould eſcape further Danger in the difficult Paſſage to it, which he feared much they ſhould not; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more careful to preſerve it, as was ſaid, than the Town; and the Ways to it, <hi>Aſpera y Fragoſa,</hi> as <hi>Ralegh</hi> has obſerved; agreeable to that Infirtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Unaptneſs for Cultivation, which <hi>Acoſta</hi> and other Naturaliſts, have deſcrib'd in thoſe Grounds which are impregnate with ſuch Treaſures. <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> urged further, that they wanted ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the Number remaining, having been much longer up the River than they expected; and that they could not carry enough from the Town up the Mountain, their Company being divided, the greater Part, in the Town itſelf, and thoſe too weak to defend it. That he further found all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Order and Obedience broke through, as ſoon as Capt. <hi>Ralegh</hi> was dead; and feared the fatal News of his Death, would either not find his ſick Father alive, or haſten his End; that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Diſcovery, and fail through any of theſe Diſcouragements, he thought would be more detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental than wholly at this Time to decline it: that to diſcover it for a Pack of Profligates and Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, was more than they deſerv'd; and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it for <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf, not likely to live, and unpardon'd, was, as whiſper'd in the Company, for a Man <hi>non ens</hi> in the Law. Above all that, it would therefore be a greater Error to find it for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> than to pretend it could no-where
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0181500200:475"/>
be found. Laſtly, that theſe Arguments approv'd of by the Majority, were confirmed by the Alarm they received at the Diſcovery of the Letters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in the Governor's Cloſet; whereby they were led, every Moment, to expect a freſh Enforcement of the Enemy againſt them from each End of the River; therefore ſeparate as the Fleet was, and not able to make Reſiſtance, they all agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>However ſpecious theſe Arguments, or ſome of them, might be, <hi>Raleigh</hi> was in no wiſe pacify'd with them. He utterly diſavowed the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Keymis</hi> before ſeveral of his Company, and the Ignorance he had pretended to them; told him, that a blind Man might have found the Place, by the Marks and Directions himſelf had ſet down under his own Hand; and that his Care of loſing more Men in paſſing the Woods was but feigned; for after his Son's Death, it was known he had no Care for any Man ſurviving, and therefore, had he brought Home but one hundred Weight of Ore, tho' with the Loſs of as many Men, it would have given the King Satisfaction, preſerved his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and encouraged a Return the next Year, with greater Force, to have held the Country for his Majeſty, to whom it belonged; for the Riches and Fruitfulneſs whereof, himſelf had formerly ſo largely atteſted. But ſince he had ſuffered his Wilfulneſs, in ſpite of his Knowledge, to defeat their whole Undertaking, he ſhould indeed be glad if <hi>Keymis</hi> could make thoſe Reaſons, for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Mine, paſſable with the State, but that he himſelf could not juſtify the Neglect. <hi>Keymis</hi> grew deeply diſcontented hereat, and continued ſo ſeveral Days. <hi>Afterwards he came to me in my Cabbin</hi> (ſays <hi>Ralegh) and ſhew'd me a Letter he had written to the Earl of</hi> Arundel, <hi>excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:0181500200:476"/>
               <hi>for not diſcovering of the Mine, uſing the ſame Arguments, and many others, which he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and prayed me to allow thereof.</hi> But <hi>Ralegh,</hi> no Way ſatisfied, declared that as <hi>Keymis</hi> could plead no Ignorance, he could admit of no Excuſe, being wounded in his Credit with the King paſt all Recovery, and that this could admit of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. <hi>Keymis,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Ralegh</hi> reſolved not to favour his Folly, retired as one knowing not what Courſe to take, yet expreſſing, perhaps, alſo ſome Deſign of giving further Satisfaction; <hi>and went out of my Cabbin into his own,</hi> ſays <hi>Ralegh,</hi> where having ſhut himſelf in, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſoon after heard a Piſtol go off, and ſending up to know who diſcharged it, <hi>Keymis</hi> made Anſwer, he fired it himſelf, becauſe it had been long charg'd. About half an Hour after, his Boy going into his Cabbin, found him dead, with much Blood by him, having a long Knife thruſt through his Left Pap into his Heart, and his Piſtol lying by him, with which it appeared that he had ſhot himſelf; but the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let being ſmall, and having only crack'd a Rib, he diſpatch'd effectually with the Knife. <note n="*" place="bottom">The Letters in the <hi>Remains</hi> aforeſaid, p. 178, 181. And the <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 39. <hi>James Howel</hi> ſays, that Captain <hi>Keymis,</hi> the main Inſtrument for the Diſcovery of the Mine, piſtol'd himſelf in a deſperate Mood of Diſcontent in his Cabbin in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertine;</hi> which not being <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Ship, would remove <hi>Keymis</hi>'s Death ſtill further from all Surmiſe that he had any ſuch foul Play done him to prevent telling of Tales, as <hi>Sanderſon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudiced Writers have maliciouſly inſinuated.

But what entirely clears the Affair, is King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration; for had there been the leaſt Shadow of Suſpicion that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had been any Way concerned in <hi>Keymis</hi>'s unfimely End, we may be well perſuaded, that Declaration would not have been ſilent thereof, which has amaſs'd and aggravated ſo many frivolous Circumſtances in this Voyage againſt him.</note>And this,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0181500200:477"/>
as I compute, happen'd about the latter End of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> aforeſaid, or perhaps the former Part of <hi>March,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ralegh</hi> mentions it in the Letters he wrote this Month into <hi>England,</hi> before referr'd to; therefore the Death of <hi>Keymis</hi> could not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the following Summer, as one Author miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. And whereas ſome had given it out, that <hi>Keymis</hi> ſlew himſelf through Remorſe that he had ſeduced and deluded ſo many Gentlemen with an imaginary Mine, <hi>Ralegh</hi> will not allow that to have been the Cauſe, but aſcribes it entirely to his own poſitive and paſſionate Temper, and ſays, that <hi>he would not have laid violent Hands on himſelf for any Man's Opinion; nor when he did, adds</hi> Ralegh, <hi>could he have ſaid unto me that he was ignorant of the Place, and knew of no ſuch Mine; for what Cauſe had I then to have rejected his Excuſes, or to have laid his Obſtinacy to his Charge.</hi> Further urging, <hi>that ſeveral Captains,</hi> whom <hi>Ralegh</hi> names, <hi>might be put to their Oaths, whether or no,</hi> Keymis <hi>did not confeſs to them, coming down the River, at a Place where they caſt Anchor, that he could, from thence, have gone to the Mine in two Hours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Accident it was determined, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Officers, to make for <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> to repair and refreſh their Ships; but before, as well as after, they arrived there, great Diſorders aroſe: Some took to Courſes of their own Head, and ran away from him, as was before-mentioned; and many others proved ſo refractory and ungovernable, that, when he came to the Iſle of <hi>St. Chriſtopher's,</hi> he was forced, under the Conduct of his Couſin, Mr. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to ſhip them Home. Of whom, tho' he had
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:0181500200:478"/>
ſhewed ſome uncommon Generoſity to ſome of them, he ſays, in the Letter he wrote from thence to his Wife on the 22d of <hi>March, I know then will not ſpare to wound me;</hi> and further declares, <hi>There is never a baſe Slave in all the Fleet that hath taken the Pains and Care that I have done; that hath ſlept ſo little, and travell'd ſo much: My Friends will not believe them, and for the Reſt I care not.</hi> In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter he ſent from hence at the ſame Time to Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> he writes to the ſame Senſe, and further adds: <hi>But theſe being gone, I ſhall,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be able, if I live, to keep the Sea till the End of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>with ſome four reaſonable good Ships;</hi> for to that Number was his Fleet now reduced. By the Time here propoſed of continuing at Sea, there might have now been Thoughts of ſome Courſe to qualify the Miſadventure of the Mine, and enable them to re attempt it; perhaps by ſome little tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Voyages: But how probable that he ſhould deſign any Thing ſo far as the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or that with ſuch ſmall Force he intended to go for the Weſtern Iſlands, to attack the <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleet, and ſurprize the Carracks, as in the King's Declaration is laid to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Charge, we ſhall leave for others to decide. 'Tis plain that nothing of this was put in Practice; for when they came to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> the Company in his own Ship mutiny'd, and thoſe who were for ſtaying aboard, whom <hi>Wilſon</hi> calls the major Part, made <hi>Ralegh,</hi> ſays he, take an Oath not to go Home but by their Allowance. But the Declaration ſays, that the greater Number were for returning to <hi>England;</hi> and that <hi>Ralegh</hi> getting on the Sea-bank put it to the Queſtion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Voices divided, ſtarboard and larboard; and that when he perceived the greater Number voted for their Return, he went to that Side and voted ſo too; but manifeſtly to the Hazard of his
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0181500200:479"/>
Life was his voting on either Side. In the ſame Declaration we are further led to believe, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>offered his own Ship, which was of great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, to his Company, if they would only ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board a</hi> French <hi>Bark; and that he made the ſame Offer to ſome of his Officers when he was come back to</hi> Ireland, <hi>as not knowing how Things would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued, and being loth to put his Head under the King's Girdle;</hi> but he did, and we ſhall ſee the Conſequence of it.</p>
            <p>By the Time that <hi>Ralegh</hi> arrived on the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſacking of <hi>St. Thome,</hi> the firing of the Town, and the Slaughter of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to the Number of four or five hundred Men, were largely deſcanted on by his Enemies, as by his Friends were his own more particular Misfortunes in the long and dangerous Sickneſs he had endur'd; his Diſappointment in the Mine; the Conſumption of ſo much Treaſure; the Loſs of his gallant Son; the violent End of his old Servant Captain <hi>Keymis;</hi> and above all the general Diſorder, Defection, and Diſperſion of his own Fleet. All together, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not ſo much a national as a univerſal Topic of Diſcourſe and Attention; every one cenſuring or commiſerating as their Intereſt or Affections mov'd. It is remember'd by <hi>Camden,</hi> that Captain <hi>John North,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>North,</hi> a valiant Gentleman, and who was much eſteemed by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> for his faithful Conduct under him throughout this Voyage, was the firſt who related the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable News of this unfortunate Expedition to King <hi>James,</hi> on the 13th of <hi>May,</hi> 1618. He ſeems to have done it in a very juſt and pathetical Manner; and it might have had a good Effect, had that King's Pity been as eaſily touch'd as his Fear. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Authors, ſome, who had been for regiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Commiſſion of King <hi>James</hi> with that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0181500200:480"/>
granted by <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> to <hi>Bertram</hi> his Captive <hi>Moor,</hi> whom he intruſted both with his Liberty, and a large Sum of Money to buy him ſome fine Horſes in <hi>Barbary,</hi> for which his Jeſter gave him a prime Place in his Fool's Chronicle; were now, upon the Expectation of a Return, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with the ſame Jeſter, to blot out the King, and enroll the Captive for a Fool: But others look'd upon this Action of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s in a nobler and more elevated Light, and as what, for the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of acquitting his fiduciary Pledges, was rather to be compared with the generous Act of that brave <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, <hi>Attilius Regulus;</hi> who, to keep his Promiſe and his Faith, returned to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> under whom he had been a Priſoner; tho' he knew that he went to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Death.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador having, by ſpecial Advertiſements, gain'd the earlieſt Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all that had paſſed at <hi>Guiana;</hi> and how, among the Reſt, his own Kinſman, the Governor, had been ſlain, broke into the King's Preſence in a turbulent Manner, and bawling out for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Audience, only of one Word, aſſaulted him with the abrupt and repeated Exclamation of <hi>Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas! Piratas! Piratas!</hi> At laſt he found Breath and Words to enlarge upon the Matter ſo effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as what tended not only to the Infringement of his Majeſty's Promiſe, but that happy Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns in their Royal Progeny; now the Match between Prince <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Dona Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> with all the Advantages it was pregnant with, was in ſuch a hopeful Degree of Maturity, even to the involving of both Nations in the moſt durable, and dreadful Hoſtilities, that the pacifick King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> was ready to do any Thing in the World to appeaſe him, and huſh it up. To this
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:0181500200:481"/>
Purpoſe, his Royal Proclamation was forthwith publiſh'd on the 11th of <hi>June,</hi> ſetting forth, that <hi>Whereas we gave Liberty to Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>and others, to undertake a Voyage to</hi> Guiana, <hi>where they had pretended a Probability of diſcovering Gold Mines, &amp;c. We did, by expreſs Limitation and Caution, reſtrain and forbid them from attempting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Act of Hoſtility upon any Territories or Subjects of foreign Princes with whom we are in Amity; and more particularly, thoſe of our dear Brother the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>in Reſpect of his Dominions in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, which, notwithſtanding, they have, by hoſtile Invaſion of the Town of</hi> St. Thome, &amp;c. <hi>broken and infringed. We have therefore held fit to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration of our utter Miſlike and Deteſtation of the ſaid Inſolencies; and for the better Detection and clearing up of the Truth, we charge all our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that have any Underſtanding or Notice thereof, to repair to any of our Privy Council, and make known their whole Knowledge, that we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The next Thing to be thought of was, a proper and plauſible Inſtrument for the Apprehenſion of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> when he ſhould come aſhore; ſuch a one was Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley</hi> ſoon found to be (and not Sir <hi>John,</hi> as one Writer erroneouſly chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens him) who was Vice-Admiral of <hi>Devon</hi> (not Lieutenant of the Tower, as the ſame negligent Author miſtakes again.) One who, though <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Countryman, and, as all others but <hi>Stucley</hi> ſay, his Kinſman too, yet moſt officiouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took that Charge, through the ſordid Proſpect of Profit; <hi>ſo unnatural, ſays</hi> Wilſon, <hi>and ſervile is the Spirit when it hath an Allay of Baſeneſs; there being many others fitter for that Employment.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0181500200:482"/>
his Orders were to bring up this great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor in a fair and courteous Manner, according to his Majeſty's gracious and mild Courſe, as it is call'd in his Declaration. And though we are told by one, otherwiſe miſguided in his Account of this Expedition, by ſome diſtorted Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it in thoſe Times, <hi>That the World much wonder'd, ſo great a wiſe Man as Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh, <hi>would return to caſt himſelf upon ſo inevitable a Rock as it was feared he would;</hi> nevertheleſs, as we are aſſured, by Captain <hi>Samuel King,</hi> an old Officer of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s, who bore him Company all this while, and has left us a particular Narrative of whatſoever occurr'd in their Journey from their landing now at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> to their final Arrival at <hi>London,</hi> that he no ſooner put into the Harbour, and heard of the Proclamation aforeſaid againſt him, than he reſolved to ſurrender himſelf volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily into his Majeſty's Hands; and to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, both moor'd his Ship and ſent his Sails aſhore the firſt Day he landed; which I take to have been in the Beginning of <hi>July,</hi> and after he had been abſent upon this Voyage a full Twelve-month. Moreover, though he ſoon met here with ſeveral diſcouraging Reports alſo, concerning the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Stay at <hi>London</hi> only for his coming up, to proſecute him, as my ſaid Manuſcript Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has it; <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſtill continued firm in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The ſaid Ambaſſador is, in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Memoirs, ſaid to have been ſent for over to <hi>Spain</hi> at this Time; and in ſome again, that his Commiſſion was expir'd; but others think, that Impatience to deliver the Succeſs of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpur'd him away, according to Inſtruction, when he had got full Aſſurance that <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſhould be diſpatch'd at ſome Rate or other, whatever he could ſay for himſelf: for he departed for <hi>Spain</hi>
               <pb n="473" facs="tcp:0181500200:483"/>
three Weeks before <hi>Ralegh</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> having left the Remainder of his Buſineſs in the Hands of ſome eſpanioliz'd Partiſans at Court, whom he had made ſure. <note n="*" place="bottom">

His firſt coming into <hi>England</hi> is remember'd by Sir <hi>John Finet,</hi> in his Obſervations touching Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ambaſſadors, to have been in 1613; being aged then, as I compute, from a Date upon one of his Pictures, 45 Years. Some have intimated, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador could not with all his worrying and baiting of King <hi>James,</hi> prevail ſo effectually for the Deſtruction of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> (how eaſy and tempting ſoever it might be to trample over the Fence that is already broken down) but that he was forced to belabour the Point with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, among thoſe Creatures who had the greateſt Influence at Court. For, as one writes, <hi>The Bargain was made, and</hi> Ralegh <hi>was devoted for a Sacrifice before they knew whether he was ſucceſsful or not; and if we may believe the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are left upon Record of that Part of Hiſtory, the King of</hi> Spain <hi>gave a good Sum of Money for his Head. Some have gone ſo ſar, as to tell us who had the Money, at leaſt a good Part of it. If this be true, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Court had in it, at that Time, ſome of the moſt infamous People that were ever concerned in any Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As to thoſe who reprove the King himſelf with it, I ſhall ſay no more than this, they ought to have been very ſure of the Truth of it, before they recorded a Thing of a</hi> Britiſh <hi>King ſo much beneath the Character of any Monarch in the World,</hi> viz. <hi>to take Money of an Enemy for the Blood of their own Subjects, and of ſuch Subjects too as were moſt dangerous to the very Enemy they were ſold to; which is neither leſs nor more, than ſelling their own Safety, as well as innocent Blood.</hi> See <hi>An Hiſtorical Account of the Voyages and Adventures of Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, 8<hi>vo.</hi> 1719, p. 38. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador ſeems to have left the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Court well ſatisfied on the 16th, and embark'd for <hi>Spain</hi> on the 20th of <hi>July</hi> 1618, having firſt emptied all the Priſons in <hi>England</hi> of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts; many of whom he carried with him home, further to grace his Triumphs, But this Ambaſſador return'd to <hi>England</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1619, under Pretence of purſuing that deluſive Negotiation, and was lodg'd not without Murmurs at the Biſhop of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Holborne.</hi> He was alſo trick d out with titular Honours, the uſual Reward of ſuch Services as his were; being newly made <hi>Conde de Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar,</hi> as Sir <hi>John Finet</hi> obſerves; otherwiſe, in the whole, not ſo ſubſtantially rewarded at Home, as the ſlaviſh Pains he took abroad to pleaſe his Prince was thought to deſerve. As for the pernicious Practices of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> which might gain him thoſe airy Gratuities, they are unfolded in a Tract, entitled <hi>Vox Populi,</hi> or <hi>News from</hi> Spain; <hi>tranſlated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Copy; which may ſerve to forewarn both</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and the</hi> United Provinces <hi>how far to truſt to</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Pretences.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If it were lawful for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to murder twenty-ſix <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> tying them back to back, and then cutting their Throats, when they had traded with them a whole Month, and came to them on the Land without ſo much as one Sword; and it may not be lawful for your Majeſty's Subjects, being charged firſt by them, to repel Force by Force; we may juſtly ſay, O miſerable <hi>Engliſh!</hi>

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Ralegh</hi> had ſettled his Affairs in the weſt of <hi>England,</hi> he began his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to his firſt Reſolution; but before he came to <hi>Aſhburton,</hi> twenty Miles from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he was met by Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley;</hi> who ſaid, <hi>he had Orders for arreſting him and his Ship. Ralegh</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>he had ſaved him the Labour, and done it to his Hands.</hi> And though at that Time <hi>Stucley</hi> had no Warrant, as our MS Author aforeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d goes on, for ſuch Arreſt, either from the King, or the Lords of the Council, <hi>for it ſeems that his Haſte was ſo great, and his Heart ſo ſet upon ſome ſuppoſed Purchaſe, that he could not ſtay for a Warrant;</hi> yet <hi>Ralegh,</hi> being told by him, that he had ſuch a verbal Commiſſion from the Secretary, did in no wife re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt even that Authority. So they went back toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and lay at Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Harris</hi> his Houſe; where Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was ſo little watch'd, that he was ſometimes two or three Days without ſeeing Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley.</hi> And <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf ſays, that <hi>Stucley</hi> left him nine or ten Days to go where he liſted, while he rode about the Country. However, as we learn from Captain <hi>King,</hi> it did, at laſt, come into <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Mind (whether upon ſome private Advices, how inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:0181500200:488"/>
the Prejudice of his Enemies was working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; or any Suggeſtions of his own, how he might work a Reconciliation more ſucceſsfully from abroad, it is not ſaid, but contrive he did) to convey himſelf out of the Kingdom. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while they were at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he employ'd our Author, the ſaid Captain <hi>King,</hi> to provide him a Bark that would carry him over into <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration ſays, <hi>Ralegh</hi> dealt with for a Bark, as for a Friend, and proffered twelve Crowns for the Paſſage: <hi>Stucley</hi> ſays, he dealt with two Captains of <hi>French</hi> Barks: the Declaration ſays, <hi>Ralegh</hi> was then under no Guard, and <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> that he was then under his keeping. But leaving theſe Inconformities to others, I here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Captain <hi>King,</hi> who informs us, that himſelf procur'd the Veſſel, which is moſt likely, and that he detain'd it nigh four Days, riding at Anchor beyond command of the Fort. The firſt Night, about one of the Clock, they ſecretly took Boat to have gone Aboard, but before they reach'd the Bark, <hi>Ralegh,</hi> whether through ſome more prevailing Thought that might ariſe of a generous Reliance upon the King, or a more confident Dependance upon the Juſtice of his Cauſe, or for any thing he left behind, or would have firſt left either in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or otherwiſe, does not yet appear; but certain it is he changed his Reſolution, and returned to his Lodging unſuſpected by any one. The next Day, he ſent Money to the Maſter of the Bark, to retain him one Night more; and yet <hi>Ralegh</hi> never went nigh him afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It has been objected, as Captain</hi> King <hi>goes on, (who does not ſay by whom, but I find it in the King's Declaration) that</hi> Ralegh <hi>was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, becauſe the Night was ſo Dark that he could not find the Veſſel:</hi> But I (ſays the Captain) who
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0181500200:489"/>
was with him, will take my Oath, that if he had been only willing to have rowed a quarter of a Mile further, he might have ſeen her. Beſides, if that Night would not have ſerved, one of the other three would, the Wind being fair, and the Tide falling out conveniently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this, ſays Captain</hi> King, Stucley <hi>received a Warrant to bring up Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>but with no more ſpeed than his Health would permit; and he took to his Aſſiſtance, one</hi> Manourie, <hi>a</hi> French <hi>Quack,</hi> upon what Occaſion (ſays <hi>King)</hi> I here will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly omit, as well becauſe I would not meddle with any Inſtrument of State, as becauſe I, little ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what followed, was ſomewhat careleſs in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of their Carriage.</p>
            <p>In their Journey they baited and lodg'd at divers Gentlemens Houſes of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Acquaintance upon the Road, from ſome of whom hearing, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the nearer he approach'd it, what a ſtorm his Enemies had brew'd at Court, he began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret his having neglected the Opportunity he had at <hi>Plymouth</hi> of retiring; which he diſcourſed of to his Lady and to Me, ſays Captain <hi>King,</hi> who told him, <hi>He could blame none but himſelf.</hi> But after that peremptory Warrant, which a Purſuivant brought down for the ſpeedy bringing up of his Perſon, he began again to meditate upon a Retreat; tho', as he grew more deſirous, it grew more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. Therefore, when he had made ſuch inland Advancement on his Journey as to have no Means left that would favour him by Water, <hi>He once more employed me (ſays Captain</hi> King) <hi>who was always ready to do any thing that might procure his Safety; being well aſſur'd in my own Conſcience, tho' he ſought to abſent himſelf till the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Fury was over, yet, as he always ſaid; That no Miſery ſhould make him Diſloyal to his King or Country. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'</hi>

Manourie, <hi>in his Declaration, ſets down that Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh <hi>ſhould, to him in private, ſpeak ill of his Majeſty; yet I muſt proteſt till my laſt Hour, that in all the Years I followed him, I never heard him name his Majeſty but with Reverence: I am ſorry the Aſſertion of that Man ſhould prevail ſo much againſt the Dead.</hi>

            <p>The particulars of Captain <hi>King</hi>'s Employment for this ſecond Eſcape, we ſhall reſpite a while, to make way for thoſe, which, according to the due Courſe of Time, muſt now be recur'd to out of that <hi>Frenchman</hi>'s Declaration, as Captain <hi>King</hi> calls it above, and ſhall do it with ſuch Juſtice as not to omit or diſguiſe any of the ill Words, againſt his Majeſty, aſcribed to <hi>Ralegh</hi> therein.

This haſtening their Departure, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd on <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning nearer to <hi>London</hi> about four Miles, and baited at Mr. <hi>Horſey</hi>'s. That here <hi>Ralegh</hi> firſt cauſed <hi>Manourie</hi> to be founded what was in his Heart (ſuſpecting, apparently, that he was deſigned as a Spy over him) by his Old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, Captain <hi>King;</hi> who, diſcourſing <hi>Manourie</hi> upon <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Calamities, ſaid, <hi>I wiſh we were all at</hi> Paris. <hi>Manourie</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I would we were all at</hi> London; <hi>what ſhould we do at</hi> Paris? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid <hi>King, as ſoon as we come to</hi> London, <hi>they will commit Sir</hi> Walter <hi>to the</hi> Tower, <hi>and cut off his Head.

On <hi>Monday</hi> they got to <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> where as <hi>Ralegh</hi> was walking on foot down the Hill, and had found, by Enquiry, that <hi>Manourie</hi> had got ſome Phyſick about him, he deſired him to prepare a Vomit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Morning. <hi>For I know,</hi> ſaid he, (as he is here repreſented, with a ſurprizing Faith already in ſuch a Man) <hi>'twill be good to evacuate bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and by this Means, I ſhall gain Time to work my Friends, order my Aſſairs, and perhaps pacify his Majeſty: otherwiſe, as ſoon as I come to</hi> London, <hi>they'll have me to the Tower, and cut off my Head, which I cannot eſcape without counterfeiting Sickneſs, which your Vomits will effect without Suſpicion.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly that, at <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> he complained of a Dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sight, with a Dizzineſs in his Head; and,

when he was conducted towards his Chamber, that he ſtagger'd, and ſtruck himſelf with ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt a Pillar in the Gallery, as made <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> think he was ſick indeed; and in that Belief, <hi>Manourie</hi> left him for that Time. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſent his Lady with the greateſt Number of his Servants forwards to <hi>London;</hi> and now it was he alſo ſent Captain <hi>King</hi> thither, on the Expedition aforeſaid (whom we ſhall meet with there, prepared for the ſame, as ſoon as <hi>Manourie</hi> is brought to an End of this ſame Story.) Then comes a Servant of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s, into <hi>Stucley</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and declares his Maſter was out of his Wits, that he left him in his Shirt, upon all four, ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnawing the Ruſhes on the Planks. <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> ſent <hi>Manourie,</hi> who found him in Bed; and aſking <hi>what he ail'd?</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>Nothing; but that he did it on Purpoſe.</hi> That then <hi>Ralegh</hi> aſked for the Vomit, and took it without any Heſitation.

aſſur'd him he could furniſh him with an harmleſs Ointment, which would yet ſoon make him all over like a Leper. <hi>Whereby, we are told,</hi> Ralegh <hi>ſaid, the Lords would be afraid to approach him, and that it would move their Pity beſides.</hi> Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been thus anointed on the Brows, Arms and Breaſt, the Bliſters roſe ſucceſsfully, and ſo ſoon ripen'd to their full Diſcolourations, that <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> at his next Viſit, perceiving <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Body all broke out in purple Spots with yellow Heads, and the reſt of his Skin ſo inflamed with Heat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he was ſtruck over with the Plague, and that it was highly contagious. But aſking <hi>Manourie</hi>'s Opinion, he truly concealed all, for that, as yet, he knew nothing of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s intended Flight; but thought it was only to gain Time to ſatisfy his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. However, away went <hi>Stucley</hi> to the grave Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> then upon the Point of his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſoon made known what a frightful Figure Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was become; deſcribed all the Tokens upon him, and, in the End, return'd with two Doctors, and one Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Phyſick. All their Skill could not enlighten them with one Spark of Knowledge in the Nature of his Diſtemper; but they gave their Opinion in Writing, that the Patient could not be removed into the Air without manifeſt Hazard of his Life; and <hi>Manourie</hi> ſet his Hand to it.</p>
            <p>Here, <hi>Ralegh</hi> is deſcrib'd to have been much delighted that Matters went on ſo proſperouſly, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that the Vomit worked ſo thoroughly in the preſence of theſe learned Doctors. But having apprehended they would inſpect his Water, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>Manourie</hi> to rub the Urinal with a certain D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

could the Phyſicians do but pronounce the Diſeaſe mortal. Further, that he then made <hi>Manourie</hi> bind his Arm about with the black Silk Ribband which he took from his Poniard; but that not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempering his Pulſe agreeable to Expectation, he had more Bliſters raiſed the next Day. By this Time his Phyſick having opened his Stomach and made him hungry, he got <hi>Manourie</hi> ſecretly to buy a Leg of Mutton and three Loaves, which he fed upon in private, and by this Subtilty, was thought to have faſted three Days, that is to <hi>Friday</hi> the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> ever feigning great Indiſpoſition and Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in Company; but when alone, for to get the Opportunity of being ſo was the chief Source of all the Artifice he did here really put in Practice, he wrote his Declaration or Apology, and is ſaid to have got <hi>Manourie</hi> to make him a Tranſcript of it; which was, as the Penman of this Story further ſays, ſince preſented to his Majeſty. But by an Expreſſion of that Ambiguity and Latitude, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are deſigned to underſtand it was before or after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death; that Penman, intelligent enough in other Parts of <hi>Manourie</hi>'s ſaid Story, and the reſt of the King's Declaration (for they were both of them viſibly caſt in one Mould) might think it not neceſſary to be ſo here. It was ſurely a moſt vexatious Stratagem, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly make ſuch a provoking Vindication of his Voyage, and thereby defeat the Preparations that were making to cut him off for it: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Opinion of Poſterity, have cleared his innocence; among his Cotemporaries, it could not ſecure his Safety.</p>

               <hi>And now</hi> Ralegh <hi>is pretended to practiſe more unreſervedly ſtill about the Eſcape with</hi> Manourie, <hi>as being all in his Power to aid him, and he the only Perſon truſted by</hi> Stucley. <hi>Whereupon he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that</hi> Ralegh, <hi>at his coming to</hi> London, <hi>ſhould lie</hi> perdue <hi>at a Friend of</hi> Manourie<hi>'s in</hi> Shire-Lane, <hi>which did not long engage his Approbation, for</hi> Ralegh <hi>reſolved otherwiſe; telling this only Perſon truſted by</hi> Stucley <hi>(through an incredible Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Communication)</hi> that he had ſent Captain <hi>King</hi> to hire him a Bark below <hi>Graveſend,</hi> which would go with all Winds, and another little Boat to carry him to it. <hi>Adding, that</hi> to hide himſelf in <hi>London,</hi> he ſhould be always apprehenſive of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery by the general Searchers that are there; but that to eſcape, he muſt get Leave to go to his own Houſe, and being there, he would ſo handle the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to ſlip from <hi>Stucley</hi> through a Back-door into the Boat with Eaſe; for no Body would dream he could go on Foot, ſeeing him ſo feeble as he ſeemed to be. <hi>Then that</hi> Manourie <hi>ſhould ſay,</hi> Why would you fly? your Apology and your laſt Declaration, do they not ſufficiently juſtify you? <hi>and that</hi> Ralegh <hi>ſhould ſilence him with,</hi> Tell me no more; a man that fears, is never ſecure.</p>

               <hi>Spain.

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:0181500200:498"/>
to make him of our Council; and if we can perſuade him to let me ſave myſelf, I will give him in Hand the Worth of two hundred Pounds Sterling. <hi>Upon theſe Words, he drew forth and ſhewed</hi> Manourie <hi>a Jewel made in the Faſhion of Hail, powder'd with Diamonds, having a Ruby in the middle, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at a hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling; and putting it into his Hands ſaid,</hi> Beſides this Jewel, he ſhall have fifty Pounds in Money; pray tell him as much from me, and perſuade him to it, I know he will truſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Overture being made by</hi> Manourie, Stucley, <hi>after ſome Parley, ſent back Word by him to</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh, that he would accept of his Offer, and bad him tell <hi>Ralegh</hi> he was content to do as he had deſired: but would chuſe rather to go with him than tarry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with Shame and Reproach; <hi>directing</hi> Manourie <hi>further to aſk,</hi> how this could be done without loſing his Office of Vice-Admiral, which coſt him ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds; alſo to what Place they ſhould go, how they ſhould live afterwards, and what Means he would carry with him to furniſh this intended Eſcape? Ralegh <hi>obviates all this with praying him to tell</hi> Stucley, that if he would ſwear unto him not to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, he would tell him his whole Intent; and that for the firſt Point, though <hi>Stucley</hi> were to loſe his Office, he ſhould yet be no loſer; that as ſoon as he was got into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> his Wife was to ſend him a thouſand Pounds; and that he ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with him only a thouſand Crowns in Money and Jewels to ſerve at preſent. <hi>After Supper,</hi> Ralegh <hi>is further repreſented ſo open, ſo contrary to all his former Character, and beyond all Manner of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as to ſay,</hi> O if I could eſcape without <hi>Stucley,</hi> I ſhould do bravely; but it's no Matter, I'll carry him along, and afterwards diſpatch myſelf of him well enough. <hi>Then</hi> Manourie <hi>having appriſed</hi> Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0181500200:499"/>
               <hi>of all that paſs'd, brought them together.</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh <hi>ſhewed the Jewel, and, probably, deliver'd it, for</hi> Stucley <hi>ſhewed himſelf content, and it was probably upon the Acceptance of it, but deſired a little Reſpite to diſpoſe of his Office.</hi> Manourie, <hi>having thus ſeen the Agreement made, took his Leave of them for</hi> London <hi>(the Part deſign'd for him ending here) after having ſaid to</hi> Ralegh, he did not think of ſeeing him again, while he was in <hi>England.</hi> Ralegh, <hi>at parting, gave him, by a Letter to a Perſon at</hi> Radford, <hi>an Iron Furnace, with a Diſtillatory of Copper belonging to it; and charged him</hi> to tell every Body he met, how ſick he was, and that he left him in an extreme Looſeneſs that very Night.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Ralegh</hi> had diſpatch'd Captain <hi>King</hi> to <hi>London</hi> with Inſtructions to be in Readineſs for him, he kept moving on; when there fell out an Accident which gave him freſh Hopes to facilitate his Eſcape.

Accordingly the next Night after <hi>Ralegh</hi> was at <hi>London,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Le Clerc</hi> and <hi>La Cheſnay</hi> came to viſit him at his Houſe: and there <hi>Le Clerc</hi> offer'd him a <hi>French</hi> Bark, which he had prepared for him to eſcape in; and withal, his Letters recommendatory for his ſafe Conduct and Reception, to the Governor of <hi>Calais;</hi> and to ſend a Gentleman expreſly that ſhould attend and meet him there. But <hi>Ralegh</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the <hi>French</hi> Bark not to be ſo ready nor ſo fit as that he had already propoſed for himſelf, gave him Thanks, and told him, that he would
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0181500200:500"/>
make uſe of his own Bark, but for his Letters, and the reſt of his Offer, that he ſhould be beholden to him, becauſe his Acquaintance in <hi>France</hi> was worn out. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ralegh</hi> might ſay this to get his Recommendation the ſtronger, but indeed his Fame was now in high Requeſt at the <hi>French</hi> Court. For one of the nobleſt Scholars in <hi>France, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Claudius Fabricius,</hi> Lord of <hi>Pereſk,</hi> writing, ſoon after, a Letter over to <hi>Camden,</hi> concludes it with theſe Words highly in his Favour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Agent having form'd a Deſign of conveying Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> to <hi>France, Monſieur de la Cheſnaye</hi> was examined before the Lords of the Council, who confeſs'd that <hi>Le Clerc</hi> had employ'd him for that Purpoſe. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> was then cited to appear before them; but as Punctilios often ariſe in Relation to Ambaſſadors, ſo here a Diſpute ſprung up, which ſeem'd to add to the Indignation already conceiv'd againſt Sir <hi>Walter;</hi> for <hi>Le Clerc</hi> refus'd to anſwer any Interrogatories, till the Lords of the Council ſhould ſtand up and be uncovered as he was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting that Sir <hi>W.

               </note> With this Paſſage, and a Word or two only of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Attempt to eſcape, after he came to <hi>London,</hi> it not being thought proper here to expatiate upon the Arts uſed in betraying it, ends the tedious Fardel of Objections accumulated to render him unworthy of Mercy in the King's Declaration, and the Story aſcribed to the obſcure <hi>Frenchman</hi> aforeſaid in it, but unconfirmed by any Affidavit or Evidence upon Oath, which, in other ſuch Caſes, have been thought neceſſary Vouchers: therefore how far to be call'd heinous Offences, Acts of Hoſtility, Depredations, Abuſes of his Charge, Impoſtures and Declenſions of Juſtice, the Reader

            <p>On Friday Night, which was the 7th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> when Captain <hi>King</hi> attended on him at his Lodgings, but was told by <hi>Ralegh</hi> that he could in no wiſe get ready to go off that Night.

Offer he ſhould make him for his Eſcape; or in ſhort, as others have not ſpared to call it, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to betray him; for tho' <hi>Ralegh</hi> might now have been ſecur'd in a direct and undiſguiſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet the Glory was to do it inſidiouſly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vizor of Friendſhip; being not more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Genius of predominant Power, than neceſſary on the preſent Occaſion, to give Room for ſo many more little Circumſtances of Objection, as might occur to ſupply the Place of one wanting, that ſhould have been capital. And this Night it was that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador aforeſaid, came to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Houſe, and made the Propoſal before recited. But when Capt. <hi>King</hi> came to him again the ſame Night, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid there was no going now without <hi>Stucley,</hi> whom he doubted not but he ſhould engage to go along with him, and that the next Night, without Failure, he would meet the Captain at the <hi>Tower-Dock.</hi> As for Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> aforeſaid, he was employ'd in <hi>garrowing</hi> Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi>'s Houſe, as the Captain phraſes it, while <hi>Ralegh,</hi> being thus drawn out of it by <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> under Pretence of bearing him Company, might be the more unexpectedly ſeiz'd with all ſuch private Papers as he ſhould have about him; in Hopes, no doubt, that by one means or other, ſomething might turn out to make a Charge of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Weight againſt him. But, in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſays our ſaid Author, all the Papers which were found, prov'd to be no other, than what might, without any Diſcredit, have been laid open to all the World.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>King</hi> went, as he further tells us, on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Night to the Place appointed with two Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> alſo came thither; having put on a falſe Beard, and a Hat with a green Hatband. He was accompany'd with Sir <hi>Lewis</hi>
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:0181500200:503"/>
               <hi>Stucley,</hi> young <hi>Stucley,</hi> and his own Page. Then aſking Captain <hi>King,</hi> if all Things were ready? he anſwer'd, they were, and that the Cloak-bag and the four Piſtols were in the Boat. <hi>Stucley</hi> then ſaluted Captain <hi>King,</hi> and aſk'd, <hi>whether</hi> thus far <hi>he had not diſtinguiſhed himſelf an honeſt Man?</hi> to which <hi>King</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>that he hop'd he would</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After they enter'd the Boats and divided the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, they had not rowed above twenty Strokes before the Watermen told them, that Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> had lately taken Boat, and made as if he would have gone through Bridge, but return'd down the River after them. This rais'd ſome Apprehenſion in <hi>Ralegh,</hi> but upon <hi>Stucley</hi>'s Encouragement they row'd on; yet <hi>Ralegh,</hi> not well ſatisfy'd, call'd Captain <hi>King</hi> near to him, who was in the other Boat with young <hi>Stucley</hi> and <hi>Hart,</hi> and intimated, that he could not go forward unleſs he was ſure of the Watermen, whom he then alſo ſpake to, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether if any ſhould come to arreſt them in the King's Name, they would row forwards or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. At this, the great Boobies were ſo frighten'd that they cry'd, and anſwer'd, they knew no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there but Captain <hi>King,</hi> who had hired them to <hi>Graveſend;</hi> and that they neither dared, nor would go any further. <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid, that a brabbling Matter with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, was the Cauſe that of Neceſſity he muſt go to <hi>Tilbury</hi> to embark for the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> and that he would give them ten Pieces of Gold for their Pains.</p>
            <p>Then began <hi>Stucley</hi>'s Part, curſing and damning himſelf that he ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Life and Fortune with a Man ſo full of Doubts and Fears. He ſwore that if the Watermen would not row on, he would kill them; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded <hi>Ralegh</hi> that there was no ſuch Danger as he
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:0181500200:504"/>
ſuſpected; of which Opinion Capt. <hi>King</hi> alſo ſtill was. Thus the Time paſs'd till they drew near <hi>Greenwich,</hi> when a Wherry croſs'd them, which <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid came to diſcover them. <hi>King</hi> ſought to diſſuade him from this Suppoſition, and told him that if they could but reach <hi>Graveſend,</hi> he would hazard his Life to get to <hi>Tilbury.</hi> Theſe Delays ſpent the Tide, and the Watermen ſaid, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to get to <hi>Graveſend</hi> before Morning. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Ralegh</hi> would have landed at <hi>Purfleet,</hi> and <hi>Hart</hi> would have poſſeſs'd him, that tho' it was Night he could procure him Horſes to <hi>Tilbury. Stucley</hi> appear'd very zealous for this Propoſal, and ſaid, that upon that Condition he could be content to carry the Cloak-bag on his own Shoulders half a Mile; but <hi>King</hi> told him, that if they could not go by Water, it was impoſſible at that Time of Night to get Horſes to go by Land.</p>
            <p>By this Time they had rowed as far as <hi>Woolwich,</hi> or rather about a Mile beyond, which might be to a Reach call'd the <hi>Gallions</hi> near <hi>Plumſtead.</hi> Here, approaching two or three Ketches, <hi>Hart</hi> began to doubt, whether any one of them was his. Upon this, <hi>Ralegh</hi> concluded they were all betray'd, and bid the Watermen turn back, hoping to have got to his own Houſe before Morning; and began to examine <hi>Hart</hi> very ſtrictly, who pretended he had given his Men expreſs Charge not to ſtir from <hi>Tilbury</hi> till he came down; but this would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Ralegh</hi> to proceed. Before they had rowed back a Furlong, they eſpied another Wherry, and hailing her, they ſaid they were for the King. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> perceiving they were ſome of Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Crew, propoſed to <hi>Stucley,</hi> ſeeing they were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and in Reſpect to his Safety, that he might remain ſtill in his Cuſtody, and that <hi>Stucley</hi> ſhould openly declare to the Watermen he was his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0181500200:505"/>
which he did. Here <hi>Stucley</hi> and he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to private Diſcourſe, contriving how <hi>Ralegh</hi> might reach his Houſe; and how <hi>Stucley</hi> might ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf harmleſs by ſaying, that he only pretended to go along with <hi>Ralegh,</hi> in order to diſcover his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and ſeize upon his private Papers. Then they whiſper'd ſome Time together, and <hi>Ralegh</hi> taking ſome Things out of his Pockets (whether more Rubies powder'd with Diamonds) our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does not ſay) and gave them to <hi>Stucley,</hi> who all this while not only hugg'd and embrac'd him, as it ſeem'd with the greateſt Tenderneſs, but made the utmoſt Proteſtations of Love, Friendſhip, and Fidelity. When they were got back to <hi>Greenwich, Stucley</hi> ſaid, that he durſt not carry <hi>Ralegh</hi> to his Houſe, but perſuaded him to land, which they did; the other ſtrange Boat landing at the ſame Time, in which the Men, they perceived, belong'd to Mr. <hi>W. Herbert</hi> and Sir <hi>William St. John,</hi> the ſame who had made good Profit of <hi>Ralegh</hi> before, as we have read. Upon <hi>Greenwich</hi> Bridge <hi>Stucley</hi> told Capt. <hi>King</hi> it would be for Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Good, that he ſhould pretend he was conſenting with him to betray his Maſter. <hi>King,</hi> not able to fathom the Depth of this Policy, as he tells us, refus'd it, thinking he ſhould not only thereby bely his own Conſcience; but make himſelf odious to the World; therefore, tho' <hi>Ralegh</hi> himſelf made ſome Motion of it to him, he could not, how ſerviceable ſoever it might prove, be guilty of ſo much Inſincerity towards him. Then <hi>Stucley</hi> arreſted the Captain in his Majeſty's Name, and committed him to the Charge of two of Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Men. After this they all went to a Tavern, and by the way, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>King</hi> heard <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſay, <hi>Sir</hi> Lewis, <hi>theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not turn out to your Credit. Ralegh</hi> was kept apart from <hi>King</hi> till Morning, when as they
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0181500200:506"/>
enter'd into the Tower, <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Stuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and <hi>Cotterell</hi> have betray'd me; adding, for your Part, you need be in Fear of no Danger, but as for me, it is I am the Mark that is ſhot at. Then Captain <hi>King,</hi> being forced to take his leave, left <hi>Ralegh,</hi> to his Tuition, with whom I do not doubt <hi>(ſays he)</hi> but his Soul reſteth. And ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his Narrative.</p>
            <p>Here the curious Reader would probably be willing to know what <hi>Stucley</hi> had to ſay for himſelf upon this Buſineſs; and this I have ſome Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of relating from the Tract he publiſh'd at <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death in his own Defence; which tho', for its Author's Behaviour aforeſaid, it has been ſo much diſregarded, that of all the Hiſtorians gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular, who have written of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> and ſome few of them, whoſe Characters are pretty well known, to his Diſparagement; I never met with one who has ſhewn it ſo much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as to quote it: Yet, as I have found ſome few Paſſages not altogether uſeleſs in explaining other Parts of this Life, ſo thoſe, which concern this Part, I have thought proper more particularly here to inſert, in obſervance to a good biographical Maxim, which enjoins us, as far as the Parts they bear in our Narrative will permit, to ſhew a due Reſpect to the Characters of all Men, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not, in Favour of any, to proſtitute our own.</p>
            <p>In this Tract, which is properly enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to the King, one of the earlieſt Motives to Revenge, in that poor Inſtrument of State, as <hi>Stucley</hi> no leſs properly calls himſelf, againſt <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> appears to be a Pretence, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had abridg'd <hi>Stucley</hi>'s Father of an incredible dividend in a Prize many Years before taken at Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a more particular Account has been before given
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:0181500200:507"/>
in its proper Place; as the laſt Motive will appear to be what <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid of this <hi>Stucley</hi> in his dying Speech. But the Arguments <hi>Stucley</hi> makes Uſe of for having betray'd him, are drawn firſt from <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s having pretended to be poiſon'd at Sir <hi>Edward Parham</hi>'s Houſe who was <hi>Stucley</hi>'s Kinſman. For he reports <hi>Ralegh</hi> to have ſaid, <hi>Tho' the Gentleman would not hurt me, yet there might be Prieſts that did it: for I remember, after my Morning's Draught of a Cup of Ale, which Sir</hi> Edward Parham <hi>offer'd me in the Hall, I felt preſently a kind of Excoriation in my Bowels, as if ſome Jeſuit had been the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Now, ſays</hi> Stucley, <hi>when I ſaw the Puſtles break out upon him at</hi> Saliſbury, <hi>my Compaſſion, I confeſs, was too credulous to report it.</hi> But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus deceived himſelf, and thereby wronging his Kinſman, it moved his Indignation againſt <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> for abuſing both: ſo that in ſhort, he drew <hi>Ralegh</hi> to his Deſtruction by a Lie, becauſe he had induced <hi>Stucley</hi> to aſperſe his Kinſman with one. And tho' Divinity would not, as <hi>Stucley</hi> owns, yet Reaſon of State would hold it lawful to lie for the Diſcovery of Treaſon, in ſervice to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Then he endeavours to reconcile himſelf to the Commonwealth, by anſwering the Objection of his being ſo Inſtrumental to the depriving it of ſo ſufficient a Member as had not left his Equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, in theſe Words: <hi>No Man denies but he had many Sufficiencies in him: But what were theſe but ſo many Weapons of Practice and Danger againſt the State; if he eſcaped? being ſo deeply tainted in ſo many Points of Diſcontent, Diſhoneſty, and Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He knew, as he had written, that as in Nature, ſo in Policy,</hi> a privatione ad habitum not fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſio. <hi>And therefore being deſperate of any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune here, agreeable to the Height of his Mind, who can doubt but he would have made up his Fortune</hi>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:0181500200:508"/>
               <hi>elſewhere, upon any Terms againſt his Soveraign and Country?</hi> In another Place, which relates to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s laſt Endeavours of eſcaping, he tells the King, <hi>On the</hi> Saturday <hi>when I received your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Commiſſion by my Couſin</hi> Herbert, <hi>I received alſo Intelligence by him, that at that Inſtant</hi> Ralegh <hi>was flying from my Cuſtody without my Privity, not having, as yet, made him any Semblance of Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent: ſo that I almoſt came upon him unawares, even, as he was putting on his falſe Beard, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſguiſements; which declares he did ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt your Goodneſs, doubtleſs out of the Conſcience of his Guiltineſs, whatever he writ or ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And is it any marvel then, that he was angry with me at his Death for bringing him back? Beſides, being a Man, as he was thought, of ſo great a Wit, it was no ſmall Grief that a Man of ſo mean Wit as I ſhould be thought to go beyond him. Yea, but you ſhould not have uſed ſuch Craft to go beyond him. No?</hi> Sic ars deluditur arte. Neque enim lex juſtior ulla eſt quam necis artifices arte perire ſua. <hi>But why did you not execute your Commiſſion bravely to his Apprehenſion on him in his Houſe? Why? my Commiſſion was to the contrary, to diſcover his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, and to ſeize his ſecret Papers, &amp;c. And can any honeſt Subject queſtion my Honeſty in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch a Commiſſion, which tended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſecret Intentions of an ill-affected Heart to my Soveraign? How can any diſlike this in me, and not bewray his own diſhoneſt Heart unto the State? Yea, but tho' another might have done this, yet how might you do it, being his Kinſman and his Friend? Surely if I had been ſo; yet in a publick Employment and Truſt laid upon me, I was not to refuſe it, much leſs to prefer private Kindneſs and Amity before my publick Duty and Loyalty: for what did I know the dangerous Conſequence of theſe Matters which were to</hi>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:0181500200:509"/>
               <hi>be diſcovered? or who knows them yet, of thoſe that make themſelves my competent Judges? But if there were no Kindred or Amity between us, as I avow there never was, what Bond then might tie me to him, but the Tie of Compaſſion to his Miſeries? which was in my Sovereign's Heart to diſtribute, when he ſaw Time, that did command me, and not in the Diſpenſation of me, nor of any other</hi> Inſtrument's <hi>Power that is to be commanded.</hi> Theſe are his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and he concludes his Pamphlet with making two humble Petitions to his moſt excellent Majeſty; <hi>Firſt, ſeeing that I, your poor loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, am burdened and oppreſſed with the Teſtimony of a bitter Enemy, of a perjured and condemned Man, againſt all Reaſon, Conſcience and Law; that I may have your Majeſty's Leave, to the Confirmation of the Truth, which I have avowed to be ſufficient; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament upon it in your Majeſty's Chapel.</hi> But if he did receive the Sacrament, to confirm the Truth of his Aſſertions, for this ſeems to be the Meaning of his Words, if they have, or were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have any; how that would juſtify the Falſhood of his Actions; and how, his taking of the Sacrament would be of any Credit to him, who has own'd, that Divinity would not hold his Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices lawful; or how clear him for the Violation of that Truſt and Fidelity he had before taken the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as we ſhall hear preſently, to maintain, he was not thought a Caſuiſt, or even Inſtrument of State enough to reſolve; the laſt Petition is, <hi>That his Majeſty would be ſo gracious as to ſuffer a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to come forth from the State, for the clearing of theſe Matters, and further Satisfaction of the World;</hi> which plainly diſcovers, that this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, ſent out under the Name of this Inſtrument, was a mere concerted Preparative to the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which ſo obſervantly followed it; like a
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:0181500200:510"/>
Fomentation to ſupple the Minds of the uneaſy People, that the ſoveraign Unguent might enter more effectually. But how little Satisfaction the ſaid Declaration gave, we have already noted; and for <hi>Stucley</hi>'s Performance, it made not ſo much as himſelf eaſy; being, in his own Opinion, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to deface the black and odious Stains of his Conduct, that he was forced to write an Apology beſides; and that was ſo little regarded, as never to have been thought worthy of the Preſs. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Life was more ſucceſsful than his Writings, and how it fared with him after this Piece of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, may be gathered from ſeveral Authors. Some hiſtorical Compurgators of this Reign, and conſequently no Friend to Ralegh's Memory, yet own, that Stucley's Deſtiny was ſuitable to his Dealings, being afterwards hang'd, ſay they, for clipping of Gold. But thoſe who had better Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and knew the Truth more particularly, have delivered it more perfectly; where they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <q>That <hi>Stucley</hi> having, for a Bag of Money, falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Faith, which he had confirmed by the Tie of the Holy Sacrament, he was, before the Year came about, caught clipping the ſame Coin, in the King's own Houſe at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> which he had received as the Reward of his Perfidiouſneſs; for which being eondemned to be hang'd, he was driven to ſell himſelf to his Shirt, to purchaſe his Pardon of two Knights. Then (to avoid the Sight and Scorn of Mankind) withdrew himſelf to a little Iſland in the Severn Sea, called the <hi>Iſle of Lundy,</hi> and there died a poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Beggar:</q> Which, as we find it elſewhere ſufficiently confirmed, was in leſs than two Years after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Death. Thus horribly did the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver's Reward prove his Puniſhment; and thus we leave this notable Monument of unproſperous Treachery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:0181500200:511"/>
               <hi>Ralegh,</hi> as was before mentioned, was now Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner again in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> being brought thither on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning the 10th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> About two or three Days after, a Committee was ſelected to examine into the aforeſaid Eſcape, it being a Matter luckily capable, and highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be enlarged upon, in order to fill up the Meaſure of Accuſation. Such a premeditated Flight was therefore declaim'd againſt as a Crime ſo heavy and ſo heinous, ſuch a Diſdain or Deſpair of his Majeſty's Mercy, as was greatly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected could never obtain his Forgiveneſs. Then again, for Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> to alienate himſelf thus from his native Country by Means of a foreign Power, was ſtretch'd out to the Idea of a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as horrid as the Breach of ſome huge Rock or Promontory from the main Land, when its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was ſap'd and waſh'd away by undermining Waves.</p>
            <p>The Arguments <hi>Ralegh</hi> now returned to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate this mighty Tranſgreſſion, having been by no Author tranſmitted to us, it is not impoſſible but they were, with the reſt of his Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Commiſſioners, during the Time of this his laſt Impriſonment, induſtriouſly ſtifled. There is, notwithſtanding, one of his own Letters on this Subject deſcended, by Means of the Preſs, to us. It is directed, by the Error of the Editor it ſeems to the Duke, tho' as yet, no more than Marquis of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and dated the 14th of <hi>October.</hi> Herein, ſays <hi>Ralegh,</hi> with Relation to his late attempted Eſcape, <q>
                  <p>That which doth comfort my Soul in this Offence is, that even in the Offence it ſelf, I had no other Intent than his Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to make his Majeſty know that my late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize was grounded upon a Truth, and which with one Ship ſpeedily ſet out, I meant to have aſſured
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:0181500200:512"/>
or to have died; being reſolved, as it is well known, to have done it from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> bad I not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. Hereby I hoped, not only to recover his Majeſty's gracious Opinion, but have deſtroyed all thoſe malignant Reports which had been ſpread of me. That this is true, that Gentleman, whom I ſo much truſted, my <hi>Keeper,</hi> and to whom I opened my Heart, cannot but teſtify; and wherein if I cannot be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed living, my Death ſhall witneſs. Yea, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot but avow it, that when we came back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> I deſired to ſave no other Treaſure than the exact <hi>Deſcription</hi> of thoſe Places in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. That I meant to go hence as a diſcontented Man, God, I truſt, and my own Actions will diſſuade his Majeſty; whom neither the Loſs of my Eſtate, thirteen Years Impriſonment, and the Denial of my Pardon, could beat from his Service; nor had the Opinion of being counted a Fool, or rather diſtract, by returning as I did, ballanc'd with my Love to his Majeſty's Perſon and Eſtate, any Place at all in my Heart.</p>

            <p>Though all other Events and Motions in this Expedition were now alſo rack'd and tenter'd by his Adverſaries; though the Commiſſioners (who were perhaps the ſame, mention'd in a Kind of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Manner, at the End of the King's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Witneſſes thereof) came now conſtantly to the Tower, to pick out or catch hold of any Thing that might contribute ſome plauſible Matter to condemn him; yet after the Examinations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examinations, and Confrontments of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Perſons in the late Voyage, none of all the Depoſitions upon Oath, that are pretended to have been taken, or were really worm'd out of them, were ever thought ſo material by the ſaid Commiſſioners, as to have been diſtinctly brought to Light, either in that Declaration or elſewhere, againſt Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh.</hi> Much leſs may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with any of the Arguments urged by himſelf in his own Defence during this Inquiſition, or cloſe and private Manner of ſiſting him from ſo many Quarters.

lawfully poſſeſſed for the Crown; at leaſt, ſo far, as not to renounce or circumvent his own Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: otherwiſe, how well he knew that if he made the leaſt Oppoſition to any Reſiſtance of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he was liable to be purſued as an Invader; or if he returned with any Gold, to be perſecuted as a Plunderer by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and if he did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he was ſtill no leſs liable to be accus'd as an Impoſtor by his Co-adventurers. But in this latter Reſpect, all Suſpicion was clearly removed, even from thoſe who by their Loſſes in this Voyage would have been moſt readily prompted to make ſuch Reproach, when they found <hi>Ralegh</hi> prove himſelf as in theſe Writings, to the Face of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſuch a far greater Loſer than any of the reſt hereby, as was before obſerved: And as for the other two Objections, <hi>Ralegh</hi> has alſo made it no leſs amply evident in the ſame Pieces, how glaringly he muſt appear to the World, a mere premeditated or deſigned Sacrifice to one of them, if King <hi>James</hi> ſhould maim his Soveraignty of its Title to <hi>Guiana,</hi> or now diſclaimed the Undertaking there which he had before authorized. For therein he has ſhewed, that his Majeſty was well reſolved of his Right in thoſe Parts bordering the <hi>Orenoque</hi> to the South, as far as the <hi>Amazons,</hi> by having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Leave to plant and inhabit there; and that his own Propoſal to go thither, was not accounted of as what would endanger the Peace, even by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to be needleſs that <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſhould carry ſuch Strength with him, if he intended no other Enterprize, for that he ſhould work any Mine there without Diſturbance; but had a good Reaſon returned by <hi>Ralegh</hi> for that Strength, from the Example of Sir <hi>John Hawkins.</hi> Further ſhewing, that for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſet up a Town upon the

               <hi>Orenoque,</hi> was ſuch a Uſurpation, and that their King ſhould thereupon call himſelf King of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> was as unreaſonable as if he were to call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe he took Poſſeſſion at <hi>Smerwick,</hi> and built a Fort there. Having alſo ſhewn, that no Peace could be broken there by him, where no Peace was maintain'd by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> both from their bloody Uſage of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> who had lately been to trade there, and from the Words in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s late Letters to the Governor; <hi>who firſt call'd us Enemies, when he hoped to cut us in Pieces,</hi> ſays <hi>Ralegh, and having fail'd, Peace-breakers; when to be an Enemy and a Peace-breaker in one and the ſame Action, is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi> Moreover, that here the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began the firſt Slaughter; that their Town was not burnt by any Knowledge or Permiſſion of his, nor his Directions to the Mine followed. Laſtly, having obſerv'd how little the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can endure that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſhould look upon any Part of <hi>America,</hi> being above a fourth Part of the whole known World, tho' the hundredth Part was never poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and withal, the many ill Conſequences of acknowledging, that we have offended the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by landing in <hi>Guiana,</hi> even to the Ruin of our Navigation, Trade, Power and Dominion in this Quarter of the Globe, where there was as much Room and Reaſon for advancing the Honour and Riches of <hi>England</hi> as of any State in Chriſtendom; he concludes his Apology with theſe Words, <hi>I have ſaid it already, and I will ſay it again,</hi> that if <hi>Guiana be not his Majeſty's, the working of a Mine there, and the taking of a Town there, had been equally perilous; for, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one, I had robb'd the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and been a Thief; and, by the other, a Diſturber or Breaker of the Peace.</hi>

Now it is plain, that King <hi>James</hi> ſo much waved his right to <hi>Guiana,</hi> at leaſt till <hi>Ralegh</hi> was put to Death (for then he aſſum'd it again, by the Power he gave for another Expedition to thoſe Parts, <note n="*" place="bottom">About a Year after the Death of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> granted Captain <hi>Roger North,</hi> a Commiſſion to inhabit and ſettle a Colony near the River <hi>Amazons</hi> in <hi>Guiana;</hi> but was ſoon aw'd by <hi>Gondomar</hi> ſo much, that, on the 15th of <hi>May</hi> 1620, he iſſued a Proclamation to recall that Gentleman from the ſaid Undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and committed his Brother, the Lord <hi>North,</hi> to the <hi>Fleet</hi> Priſon for haſtning the ſaid Voyage.</note>however, irreſolutely according to Cuſtom, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd it) that as we obſerve in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> not only the place which <hi>Ralegh</hi> went to is pretended to be out of his Commiſſion, but the Title he ſtood upon, to be no ways compatible with it. Yet ſo inconteſtably did <hi>Ralegh</hi> make it appear, no doubt in his Examinations at Preſent, no leſs than in the Writings abovemention'd, that if any Peace could be broken where no Peace had been maintain'd, it muſt either be by King <hi>James</hi> himſelf, in firſt granting a Commiſſion to plunder another Prince (for he knew where <hi>Ralegh</hi> was going, and no where declines his Knowledge that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſettled there) and then betraying it to procure a Defeat of the very Attempt he had empower'd; or elſe by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, in reſiſting his Endeavours to put it in Execution; that after all this queſtioning, canvaſing, and heaping up of Allegations againſt him, the Council could not think it juſtifiable to take away Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>'s Life for all that had paſſed at <hi>Guiana.</hi> Yet, as he muſt be put to Death, they found a Way to appeaſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with his Blood, by making this laſt Action at <hi>St. Thome</hi> the <hi>efficient</hi> Cauſe, but the obſolete Condemnation at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> fifteen Years paſt, the <hi>nominal</hi> Cauſe of his Deſtruction: as a

But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, then abſolute at Court, and ſole Managers of the King's Power no leſs than his Juſtice, did ſo far tender his Catholick Majeſty's full Satisfaction in the procuring of his Death, the only Man of Note left alive who had helped to beat them in the Year 1588; that no Abſurdity lying in the way of his Proſecution, could deter them from making Uſe of his former Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; remembring, withal, how far his Wit had puzzled them at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and how much the Jury, who condemn'd him there, were touch'd in their Conſciences; which made it the leſs probable they ſhould be able to Impannel one ſo wicked as would do it then.

A Method, however, of diſpatching him being thus piec'd out, the King, or thoſe with whom he left the Management of this Affair when he went upon his Progreſs, appear'd very eager for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to a Period. Therefore, as the ſhorteſt way, a privy Seal was ſent to the Judges, forthwith to order Execution. But they conſidering there ought to be ſome Face of Regularity in the Matter, and a little Finger in the Court of Juſtice to ſlide it off with as much Decency and Smoothneſs as the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would allow of, demur'd upon that extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manner of Proceeding.

            <p>
               <hi>On</hi> Wedneſday, <hi>the 28th of</hi> October, <hi>Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh, <hi>at eight o'Clock in the Morning, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked out of a Fit of a Fever, with Summons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to appear at the</hi> King's-Bench <hi>Bar at</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter; <hi>and, ſoon after nine o'Clock, he was, by Writ of</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>brought thither. The Writ being deliver'd to the Judges by Sir</hi> Walter Apſley, <hi>and Sir</hi> Walter Ralegh<hi>'s Conviction at</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter <hi>read, the Attorney, Mr.</hi> Henry Yelverton, <hi>ſet forth,</hi> That the Priſoner having been fifteen Years ſince convicted of High-Treaſon, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Judgment of Death, his Majeſty, of his abundant Grace, had been pleaſed to ſhew Mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, till now, that Juſtice calls to him for Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> (continued he) hath been a Stateſman, and a Man, who, in regard to his Parts and Quality, is to be pitied: He hath been as a Star at which the World have gazed; but Stars may fall, nay they muſt fall when they trouble the Sphere wherein they abide. It is therefore his Majeſty's
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:0181500200:520"/>
Pleaſure now to call for Execution of the former Judgment, and I now require Order for the ſame. <hi>Then the Clerk of the Crown, Mr.</hi> Fanſhaw, <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read the Record of the Conviction and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Priſoner, holding up his Hand, was aſk'd,</hi> what he could ſay, why Execution ſhould not be awarded againſt him. Ralegh <hi>told the Lords,</hi> his Voice was grown weak by his late Sickneſs, and an Ague he had at that Inſtant upon him, in which he was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore (as it appears in another Copy of theſe Proceedings before referr'd to) deſired the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Pen and Ink. <hi>But the Lord Chief Juſtice, Sir</hi> Henry Montague, <hi>telling him</hi> he ſpake audibly enough, <hi>he went on to this Effect:</hi> That he hoped the Judgment he received to die ſo long ſince, could not now be ſtrained to take away his Life; ſince by his Majeſty's Commiſſion for his late Voyage, it was imply'd to be reſtor'd, in giving him Power as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal on the Life and Death of others; and ſince he undertook the ſame to honour his Sovereign, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich his Kingdom with Gold, of the Ore whereof, this Hand, ſaid he, hath found and taken in <hi>Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Then beginning to mention by what unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unblameable Means the ſaid Enterprize miſcarried, the Lord Chief Juſtice interrupted and told him,</hi> whatever he ſpoke touching his Voyage was not to the Purpoſe; alſo that his Commiſſion could be of no Service to him; that Treaſon was not pardon'd by Implication, and that he muſt ſay ſomething elſe to the Purpoſe, otherwiſe they muſt proceed to give Execution. Ralegh <hi>then finding whatever he ſhould offer in his own Juſtification would be no Way to the Purpoſe, put himſelf upon the King's Mercy; yet gave ſome Reaſons</hi> why he hoped the King would take Compaſſion upon him concerning that Judgment which was ſo long paſt, in which both his Majeſty was of Opinion, and there were ſome preſent who
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:0181500200:521"/>
could witneſs, that he had hard Uſage. <hi>The Lord Chief Juſtice adviſed him to the Wiſdom of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and told him,</hi> he was called to grant Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon the Judgment given fifteen Years ſince; all which Time he had been as a Man dead in the Law, but the King, in Mercy, ſpared him; that he might think it heavy if this were done in cold Blood; but it was not ſo, for new Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nces had ſtirr'd up his Majeſty's Juſtice to revive what the Law had formerly caſt upon him. I know, <hi>continued he,</hi> that you have been valiant and wiſe, and I doubt not but you retain both theſe Virtues, for now you ſhall have Occaſion to uſe them. Your Faith hath heretofore been queſtioned, but I am reſolved, you are a good Chriſtian; for your Book, which is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Work, doth teſtify as much. I would give you Counſel, but I know you can apply unto yourſelf far better than I am able to give you. <hi>Yet with the good Neighbour in the Goſpel, he was for pouring ſome Oil into his Wounds; tho' far was it from yielding the Refreſhment he promiſed, by Reaſon of the Severity wherewith he ſo ſharpened the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi> I give you the Oil of Comfort, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> though in Reſpect that I am a Miniſter of the Law, mixed with Vinegar. <hi>Nay, the Judge further gave him, how unneceſſary ſoever he juſt before own'd it to be, one</hi> Lecture upon Sorrow. Sorrow, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> will not avail you in ſome Kind; for were you pained, Sorrow would not eaſe you; were you afflicted, Sorrow would not relieve you; were you tormented, Sorrow would not content you; and yet the Sorrow for your Sins would be an everlaſting Comfort to you. <hi>Then another alſo upon</hi> Death. You muſt do as that valiant Captain did, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> who, perceiving himſelf in Danger, ſaid, in Defiance of Death, <hi>Death, thou expecteſt me; but,</hi> maugre thy Spite, <hi>I expect thee.</hi> Fear not Death too much,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:0181500200:522"/>
nor fear Death too little; not too much, leſt you fail in your Hope; nor too little, leſt you die preſumptuouſly: and here I muſt conclude my Prayers to God for it, and that he would have Mercy on your Soul. <hi>So he ended with ſaying,</hi> Execution is granted.</p>
            <p>Ralegh <hi>then deſir'd, that he might not be cut off ſo ſuddenly; for that he had ſomething to do in Diſcharge of his Conſcience, ſomething to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his Majeſty, and ſomething the World in: he deſir'd further, that he might be heard at the Day of his Death; and concluded with calling on</hi> God to be his Judge, before whom he ſhould ſhortly appear, that he was never diſloyal to his Majeſty; which I will juſtify, ſaid he, where I ſhall not fear the Face of any King on Earth. <hi>Thus the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts here chiefly followed, conclude; but in the more ancient Copy of theſe Proceedings,</hi> Ralegh<hi>'s Concluſion, to the ſame Senſe, is thus more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly expreſs'd:</hi> I moſt humbly beſeech your Lordſhips, that you will grant me ſome Time before my Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I may ſettle my Affairs and my Mind more than they yet are; for I have much to do, both for my Reputation, Conſcience, and Loyalty; and I would beſeech the Favour of Pen, Ink, and Paper, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs myſelf ſomething thereby, and to diſcharge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſome Truſt of worldly Matters that were put in me; which Leiſure, I beſeech you think, that I crave not for to gain one Minute of Life; for now being old, ſickly, in Diſgrace, and certain to go to it, Life is weariſome to me. And I do laſtly beſeech your Lordſhips, that, when I come to die, I may have Leave to ſpeak freely at my Farewell, to ſatisfy the World only, that I was ever loyal to the King, and a true Lover of this Commonwealth; for this I will ſeal with my Blood. <hi>So craving their Prayers, he was led away to the</hi> Gate-houſe, <hi>near the</hi> Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>

               <hi>The King was all this while retir'd as it were, or at ſome Remoteneſs from this tragical Scene, and, as I have receiv'd it from particular Tradition, in</hi> Hertfordſhire; <hi>as if he would have diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not only from the Sight or Report, but even the Thoughts of it: yet what an effectual and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious Hand he had in it, may further appear by his ſpecial Warrant for the Execution; which was produced ready ſign'd, as if it at</hi> Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>in a Manner as ſoon as the Sentence was over, being dated the ſame Day, and directed to his Chancellor</hi> Verulam. <hi>Herein, his gracious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> diſpenſing with the Manner of Execution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his former Judgment, and releaſing him of the ſame to be drawn, hang'd and quarter'd, ſays, our Pleaſure is, inſtead thereof, to have the Head only of the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> cut off, at or within our Palace of <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> commanding the ſaid Chancellor hereupon to direct two ſeveral Writs under the Great Seal; one to the Lieutenant of the Tower, or his Deputy, for the Delivery of Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh</hi> to the Sheriffs of <hi>Middleſex</hi> at the ſaid Palace; and the other to the ſaid Sheriffs for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſaid Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> from the ſaid Lieutenant, and for executing him there; for which this to be his Warrant and Diſcharge againſt us our Heirs and Succeſſors for ever.</p>

            <p>The next Morning, being <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 29th of <hi>October,</hi> and the <hi>Lord-Mayor's-Day,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was conducted, by the Sheriffs of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> to the Old <hi>Palace-yard</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where there was a large Scaffold erected before the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-houſe</hi> for his Execution. He had on a wrought Night-cap under his Hat, a Ruff Band, a black wrought Velvet Night-Gown over a Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd Sattin Doublet, and a black wrought Waiſtcoat, a Pair of black cut Taffety Breeches, and Aſh-colour'd Silk Stockings. He mounted the Scaffold with a chearful Countenance, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen of his Acquaintance there preſent. Then Proclamation
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:0181500200:527"/>
being made by an Officer for Silence, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd his Speech with informing them, that as he was yeſterday taken out of his Bed in a ſtrong Fit of a Fever, which much weaken'd him, and whoſe Untimelineſs forbearing no Occaſion or Place, he expected it again To-day; therefore did firſt implore God, that he would preſerve him from the Interruptions thereof at this Time, and next deſired the Audience, if any Diſability of Voice or Dejection of Countenance ſhould appear in him, that they would impute it rather to the Diſorder of his Body than any Diſmay of Mind. Then pauſing a little, he ſat down, and directed himſelf towards a Window, where the Lords <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel, Northampton, Doncaſter,</hi> with other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were ſitting, and begun his Speech. But they being at ſome Diſtance from the Scaffold, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended they did not plainly diſtinguiſh his Words, therefore ſaid, he would ſtrain his Voice, for that he would willingly have them hear him. To which the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> anſwer'd, they would rather come down to the Scaffold; which he and ſome others did. Then Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> having ſaluted them ſeverally, began again, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
            <p>I thank God, that he has ſent me to die in the Light and not in Darkneſs. I likewiſe thank God, that he has ſuffer'd me to die before ſuch an Aſſembly of honourable Witneſſes, and not obſcurely in the <hi>Tower;</hi> where, for the Space of thirteen Years together, I have been oppreſs'd with many Miſeries. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him Thanks, that my Fever hath not taken me at this Time, as I prayed to him it might not; that I might clear myſelf of ſome Accuſations unjuſtly laid to my Charge, and leave behind me the Teſtimony of a true Heart both to my King and Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:0181500200:528"/>
There are two main Points of Suſpicion that his Majeſty hath conceived againſt me, and which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, have ſpecially haſtned my coming hither; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſire to clear them to your Lordſhips, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve you in the Truth thereof. The firſt is, that his Majeſty hath been inform'd, I have had ſome Plot or Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> for which he had ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, tho' grounded upon a weak Foundation. One was, that when I return'd to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> I endeavoured to go to <hi>Rochel,</hi> which was becauſe I would fain have made my Peace before I came to <hi>England.</hi> Another Reaſon was, that again I would have bent my Courſe to <hi>France,</hi> upon my laſt intended Eſcape from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> being the Place where I might have the beſt Means of making ſuch Peace, and the beſt Safeguard during that Terror from above. Theſe, join'd with the coming of the <hi>French</hi> Agent to my Houſe here in <hi>London,</hi> only to confer about my ſaid Voyage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the report of my having a Commiſſion from the King of <hi>France,</hi> might occaſion my being ſo ſuſpected in this particular, and his Majeſty to be ſo diſpleaſed with me. But this I ſay; for a Man to call God to Witneſs at any Time to a Falſhood, is a grievous Sin. To call him as Witneſs to a Falſhood at the Point of Death, when there is no Time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is a Crime far more impious and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; therefore, for me to call that Majeſty to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an Untruth, before whoſe Tribunal I am inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear, were beyond Meaſure ſinful, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hope of Pardon. I do yet call that great God to witneſs, that, as I hope to ſee him, to be ſaved by him, and live in the World to come, I never had any Plot or Intelligence with the <hi>French</hi> King, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Commiſſion from him, nor ſaw his Hand or Seal; that I never had any Practice or Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>French</hi> Agent, nor ever knew or ſaw ſuch a Perſon, till I met him in my Gallery unlook'd
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:0181500200:529"/>
for. If I ſpeak not true, O Lord, let me never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thy Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Suſpicion or Imputation was, that his Majeſty hath been informed, I had ſpoken diſloyally of him. The only Witneſs of this was, a baſe <hi>Frenchman,</hi> a Renegade, a chymical Fellow, whom I ſoon knew to be perfidious; for being drawn by him into the Action of freeing myſelf at <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> in which I confeſs my Hand was touch'd, he, being ſworn to Secrecy over-night, revealed it the next Morning. 'Tis ſtrange, that ſo mean a Fellow could ſo far incroach himſelf into the Favour of the Lords; and, gaping after ſome great Reward, could ſo falſly accuſe me of ſeditious Speeches againſt his Majeſty, and be ſo credited. But this I here ſpeak, it is no Time for me to flatter or to fear Princes, I, who am ſubject only unto Death; and for me, who have now to do with God alone, to tell a Lye to get the Favour of the King were in vain: And yet, if ever I ſpake diſloyally or diſhoneſtly of the King, either to this <hi>Frenchman</hi> or any other; ever intimated the leaſt Thought hurtful or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial of him, the Lord blot me out of the Book of Life.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I did attempt to eſcape, and it was only to ſave my Life. I likewiſe confeſs, that I feigned myſelf to be indiſpoſed at <hi>Salisbury;</hi> but I hope it was no Sin; for the Prophet <hi>David</hi> did make himſelf a Fool, and ſuffer'd Spittle to fall upon his Beard to eſcape from the Hands of his Enemies, and it was not imputed unto him as a Sin: what I did, was only to prolong Time, till his Majeſty came, in Hopes of ſome Commiſeration from him.</p>
            <p>But I forgive that <hi>Frenchman;</hi> and likewiſe Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> the Wrongs he hath done me with all my Heart; for I have received the Sacrament this Morning of Mr. <hi>Dean,</hi> and I have forgiven all Men;
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:0181500200:530"/>
but, in Charity to others, am bound to caution them againſt him, and ſuch as he is. For Sir <hi>Lewis Stucley,</hi> my Keeper and Kinſman, hath affirmed, that I ſhould tell him, my Lord <hi>Carew</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Doncaſter</hi> here, did adviſe me to eſcape; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before God, I never told him any ſuch Thing; neither did theſe Lords adviſe me to any ſuch Matter. It is not likely I ſhould acquaint two Privy Counſellors of my Eſcape; or that I ſhould tell him, my Keeper, it was their Advice; neither was there any Reaſon to tell it him, or he to report it; for it was well known, he left me ſix, eight, or ten Days together alone, to go whither I liſted, while he rode about the Country. He further accus'd me, that I ſhould ſhew him a Letter, whereby I did ſignify, that I would give him ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds to eſcape; but God caſt my Soul into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire if ever I made ſuch Proffer of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, or one thouſand Pounds; but indeed, I ſhewed him a Letter, that if he would go with me, there ſhould be Order taken for the Diſcharge of his Debts when he was gone; neither had I one thouſand Pounds, for, if I had, I could have made my Peace better with it otherwiſe than by giving it <hi>Stucley.</hi> Further, he gave out, when I came to Sir <hi>Edward Parham</hi>'s Houſe, who had been a Follower of mine, and gave me good Entertainement, I had there recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome Dram of Poiſon. When I anſwer'd that I feared no ſuch Thing, for I was well aſſur'd of thoſe in the Houſe; and therefore wiſhed him to have no ſuch Thought. Now I will not only ſay, that God is the God of Revenge, but alſo of Mercy; and I deſire God to forgive him, as I hope to be forgiven. <hi>Then caſting his Eye upon his Note of Remembrance, he went on thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was told the King, that I was brought perforce into <hi>England;</hi> and that I did not intend to return again. Whereas Captain <hi>Charles Parker,</hi> Mr.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:0181500200:531"/>
               <hi>Treſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leak,</hi> and divers others that knew how I was dealt withal by the common Soldiers, will witneſs to the contrary. They were an hundred and fifty of them who mutiny'd againſt me, and ſent for me to come to them; for unto me they would not come. They kept me cloſe Priſoner in my Cabbin, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to take an Oath, that I would not go into <hi>England</hi> without their Conſent, otherwiſe they would have caſt me into the Sea. After I had taken this Oath, I did, by Wine, Gifts, and fair Words, ſo work upon the Maſter-gunner, and ten or twelve of the Faction, that I won them to deſiſt from their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and intended, when I returned home, to procure their Pardon; in the mean while propoſed, that I would diſpoſe of ſome of them in <hi>Ireland;</hi> to which they agreed, and would have gone into the North Parts, from which I diſſuaded them, and told them, they were <hi>Red-ſhanks</hi> who inhabited there, ſo drew them to the South; and the better to clear myſelf of them, was forced to get them an hundred and fifty Pounds at <hi>Kingſale,</hi> otherwiſe I had never got from them.</p>
            <p>There was a Report alſo, that I meant not to go to <hi>Guiana</hi> at all; and that I knew not of any Mine, nor intended any ſuch Matter, but only to get my Liberty, which I had not the Wit to keep. But it was my full Intent to go for Gold, for the Benefit of his Majeſty, myſelf, and thoſe who went with me, with the Reſt of my Countrymen: tho' he that knew the Head of the Mine, would not diſcover it when he ſaw my Son was ſlain, but made himſelf away. <hi>Then turning to the Earl of</hi> Arundel, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> My Lord, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Gallery of my Ship at my Departure, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you took me by the Hand, and ſaid, you would requeſt one Thing of me; which was, whether I made a good Voyage or a bad, that I would return again into <hi>England;</hi> which I then promis'd, and gave you
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:0181500200:532"/>
my Faith I would. So you did, ſaid his Lordſhip, 'tis true, and they were the laſt Words I ſaid to you. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſlander was raiſed of me, that I ſhould have gone away from them, and have left them at <hi>Guiana;</hi> but there were a great many worthy Men, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me always, as my Serjeant-major, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others (whom he nam'd) that knew it was none of my Intention. Alſo it hath been ſaid, that I ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of freſh Water; to which I anſwer, every one was, as they muſt be in a Ship, furniſh'd by Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not according to their Appetites. This Courſe all Seamen know muſt be uſed among them, and to this Straight were we driven. Another Opinion was held, that I carried with me ſixteen thouſand Pieces of Gold; and that all the Voyage I intended, was but to gain my Liberty, and this Money into my Hands: But as I ſhall anſwer it before God, I had no more in all the World, directly or indirectly, than one hundred Pounds, whereof I gave about forty-five Pounds to my Wife. But the Ground of this falſe Report was, that twenty thouſand Pounds being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured, and but four thouſand appearing in the Surveyor's Books, the Reſt had my Hand to the Bills for divers Adventures; but, as I hope to be ſav'd, I had not a Penny more than one hundred Pounds. Theſe are the material Points I thought good to ſpeak of; I am at this Inſtant to render my Account to God, and I proteſt, as I ſhall appear before him, this that I have ſpoken is true.</p>
            <p>I will borrow but a little Time more of Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> that I may not detain him too long; and herein I ſhall ſpeak of the Imputation laid upon me through the Jealouſy of the People, that I had been a Perſecutor of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> that I rejoiced in his Death, and ſtood in a Window over-againſt him when he ſuffer'd, and puff'd out Tobacco in Defiance of him; when as, God is my Witneſs, that I ſhed Tears for
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:0181500200:533"/>
him when he denied; and, as I hope to look God in the Face hereafter, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> did not ſee my Face at the Time of his Death; for I was far off, in the Armory, where I ſaw him, but he ſaw not me. 'Tis true, I was of a contrary Faction; but I take the ſame God to witneſs, that I had no Hand in his Death, nor bare him any ill Affection, but always believed it would be better for me that his Life had been preſerved; for after his Fall, I got the Hatred of thoſe who wiſhed me well before; and thoſe who ſet me againſt him, ſet themſelves afterwards againſt me, and were my greateſt Enemies: And my Soul hath many Times been grieved, that I was not nearer to him when he died; becauſe, as I underſtood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he aſked for me at his Death, and deſired to have been reconciled to me.</p>
            <p>And now I entreat, that you all will join with me in Prayer to that great God of Heaven, whom I have grievouſly offended, being a Man full of all Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who has lived a ſinful Life in ſuch Callings as have been moſt inducing to it; for I have been a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a Sailor, and a Courtier, which are courſes of Wickedneſs and Vice; that his Almighty Goodneſs will forgive me; that he will caſt away my Sins from me; and that he will receive me into everlaſting Life: So I take my leave of you all, making my Peace with God.</p>
            <p>Then Proclamation being made, that all Men ſhould depart the Scaffold, he prepared himſelf for Death, giving away his Hat and Gap and Money to ſome Attendants who ſtood near him. When he took leave of the Lords and other Gentlemen, he intreated the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> to deſire the King, that no ſcandalous Writings to defame him might be publiſh'd after his Death. Concluding, <hi>I have a long Journey to go, therefore muſt take my leave.</hi>
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:0181500200:534"/>
Then having put off his Gown and Doublet, he call'd to the Headſman to ſhew him the Ax, which not being ſuddenly done, he ſaid, <hi>I pr'ythee let me ſee it. Doſt thou think that I am afraid of it?</hi> Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finger'd the Edge of it a little he return'd it, and ſaid, ſmiling, to the Sheriff, <hi>This is a ſharp Medicine, but it is a ſound Cure for all Diſeaſes;</hi> and having intreated the Company to pray to God to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen him, the Executioner kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and aſked him Forgiveneſs; which <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> laying his Hand upon his Shoulder, granted. Then being aſked, which way he would lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the Block, he anſwer'd, <hi>So the Heart be right, it is no Matter which way the Head lies.</hi> As he ſtoop'd to lay himſelf along, and reclined his Head, his Face being towards the Eaſt, the Headſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpread his own Cloak under him. After a little Pauſe, he gave the Sign that he was ready for the Stroke by lifting up his Hand, and his Head was ſtruck off at two Blows, his Body never ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or moving. His Head was ſhew'd on each ſide of the Scaffold, and then put into a red Leather Bag, and, with his Velvet Night-gown thrown over it, was afterwards conveyed away in a Mourning Coach of his Lady's. His Body, as we are told, was buried hard by, in the Chancel of St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Church, near the Altar; but his Head was long preſerved in a Caſe by his Widow, for ſhe ſurvived him twenty-nine Years, as I have found by ſome Anecdotes remaining in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and after her Death, it was kept alſo by her Son <hi>Carew,</hi> with whom it is ſaid to have been Buried.</p>
            <p>Thus have we ſeen how Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> after a ſhining and conſpicuous Series of Actions againſt the Enemies of his Country, and for the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Navigation as well as the Enlargement and
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:0181500200:535"/>
Enrichment of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, under one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, was deprived of his Liberty, his Eſtate, and his Life under another; how Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh,</hi> who had been one of the greateſt Scourges of <hi>Spain,</hi> was made a Sacrifice to it; how the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> I ſay, in Camp, in Court, by Land, by Sea, with Sword and Pen, were an Honour to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; and how his Sufferings at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, by Law, with Slander and the Ax, were the Diſgrace of King <hi>James</hi>'s. Writers vary in their Accounts of his Age; but the moſt credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hiſtorians inform us, that he was ſixty-ſix Years Old at his Execution. Yet was it conjectured, by the extraordinary Effuſion of Blood from his Veins, that he had Stock and Strength enough left of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have ſurvived many Yaars. <hi>His Death was managed by him, as one Author has obſerved, with ſo high and religious a Reſolution, as if a</hi> Roman <hi>had acted a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>or rather a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>a</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: And this is confirm'd by Sir <hi>Richard Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Evidence, who ſays, <hi>He died in a good and religious Manner; ſpake much, and without any Fear of Death ſubmitted himſelf to the Block; by his Death he gained great Reputation in this Life, and, by the Grace and Mercy of God, Remiſſion of his Sins and Eternal Life hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, ſince it is Time to cloſe the Scene, <hi>Let this glorious and gallant Cavalier, whoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have confeſs'd he was one of the weightieſt and wiſeſt Men that this Iſland ever bred, reſt in his Grave, and may his Virtues live in Poſterity;</hi> whom to inſpire therewith, the Felicities of Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however here diſpoſed of, ſeem to have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally combin'd; having tranſmitted many ample Teſtimonies, how emulous the Harmony of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and the Spirit of Communication have been
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:0181500200:536"/>
to reſtore thoſe Honours to his Memory which were torn from his Perſon; and make Hiſtorical Compenſation for ſuch honourable Calamities: and that ſo early, that from this ſpeedy Growth of his Fame, through his extraordinary Merits and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, the learned and judicious Mr. <hi>Nathanael Carpenter,</hi> who wrote but few Years after his Death, drew that comprehenſive Character which has ſo much engaged the Concurrence of all ſucceeding Writers; where he ſays, <hi>Who hath not known or read of that Prodigy of Wit and Fortune, Sir</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ralegh? <hi>A Man unfortunate in nothing elſe but in the greatneſs of his Wit and Advancement! Whoſe eminent Worth was ſuch, both in domeſtick Policy, foreign Expeditions and Diſcoveries; in Arts and Literature, both Practic and Contemplative, that it might ſeem at once to conquer both Example and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> But leſt a private Judgment ſhould be ſuſpected, more liable to the Ignorance of a Stranger, or the Affection of a Friend; and that there may be no room left to doubt either of ſuch manifold Worth in Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> or that it was all made a Sacrifice of State to the Enemies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of the State, we have reſerved, as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, the Acknowledgments of an Enemy, who made him that Sacrifice, here to conclude with. For King <hi>James,</hi> ſoon after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Execution, beginning to ſee how he was, and would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> made one of his Miniſters write to h s Agent in <hi>Spain,</hi> to let that State know, they ſhould be look'd upon as the moſt unworthy People in the World, if they did not now act with Sincerity, ſince his Majeſty had given ſo many Teſtimonies of his; and now of late, by cauſing Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> to be put to Death, chiefly for the giving them Satisfaction. Further to let them ſee how, in many Actions of late, his Majeſty had

THAT he did conſpire, and go about to deprive the King of his Government, to raiſe up Sedition within the Realm, to alter Religion, to bring in the Roman Superſtition, and to procure foreign Enemies to invade the Kingdom.

            <p>It was agreed, the better to effect all this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, That <hi>Arabella</hi> ſhould write three Letters, one to the Arch-duke, another to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a third to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and promiſe three Things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> To eſtabliſh a firm Peace between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Spain.

            <p>And, for the effecting theſe traiterous Purpoſes, <hi>Cobham</hi> ſhould return by the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and ſhould there find Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> Captain of the ſaid Iſle, and take Counſel of <hi>Ralegh</hi> for the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of the aforeſaid Crowns, as the Occaſion or Diſcontentment of the Subjects ſhould give Cauſe and Way.</p>

               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:0181500200:540"/>
told <hi>Brook</hi> all theſe Treaſons: To the which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Brook</hi> gave his Aſſent, and did join himſelf to all theſe; and after, on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Brook</hi> did ſpeak theſe Words; <hi>That there would never be a good World in</hi> England, <hi>till the King</hi> (meaning our Sovereign Lord) <hi>and his Cubs</hi> (meaning his Royal Iſſue) <hi>were taken away.</hi>

            <p>And the more to diſable and deprive the King of his Crown, and to confirm the ſaid <hi>Cobham</hi> in his Intents, <hi>Ralngh</hi> did publiſh a Book, falſly written againſt the moſt juſt and Royal Title of the King, knowing the ſaid Book to be written againſt the juſt Title of the King; which Book <hi>Cobham</hi> after that received of him.

               <p>You have heard of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s bloody Attempts, to kill the King and his royal Progeny, and, in Place thereof, to advance one <hi>Arabella Stuart.</hi> The Particulars of the Indictment are theſe: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Ralegh</hi> met with <hi>Cobham</hi> the 9th of <hi>June,</hi> and had Conference of an Invaſion, of a Rebellion, and an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to be made by the King's Subjects, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:0181500200:542"/>
the King, and to kill his Children, poor Babes, that never gave Offence: Here is Blood, here is a new King and Governor. In our King conſiſts all our Happineſs, and the true Uſe of the Goſpel; a Thing, which we all wiſhed to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the Death of the Queen. Here muſt be Money to do this, for Money is the Sinew of War. Where ſhould that be had? Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> muſt procure it of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> 5 or 600,000 Crowns, and out of this Sum, <hi>Ralegh</hi> muſt have 8000; then there muſt be Friends to effect this. <hi>Cobham</hi> muſt go to <hi>Albert,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> from whom <hi>Aremberg</hi> was Ambaſſador at that Time in <hi>England.</hi> And what then? He muſt perſuade the Duke to aſſiſt the pretended Title of <hi>Arabella.</hi> From thence <hi>Cobham</hi> muſt go to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and perſuade him to aſſiſt the ſaid Title. Since the Conqueſt, there was never the like Treaſon. But out of whoſe Head came it; Out of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s, who muſt alſo adviſe <hi>Cobham</hi> to uſe his Brother <hi>Brook</hi> to incite the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> to write three ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as aforeſaid in the Indictment; all this was on the 9th of <hi>June.</hi> Then three Days after, <hi>Brook</hi> was acquainted with it: After this, <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Brook,</hi> 'Twill never be well in <hi>England,</hi> till the King and his Cubs are taken away. Afterwards <hi>Ralegh</hi> delivered a Book to <hi>Cobham,</hi> treacherouſly written againſt the Title of the King. It appears, that <hi>Cobham</hi> took <hi>Ralegh,</hi> to be either a God, or an Idol. <hi>Gobham</hi> endeavours to ſet up a new King, or Governor. God forbid, mine Eyes ſhould ever ſee ſo unhappy a Change. As for the Lady <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> ſhe, upon my Conſcience, hath no more Title to the Crown than I have; which, before God, I utterly renounce. <hi>Cobham,</hi> a Man bred in <hi>England,</hi> hath no Experience abroad. But <hi>Ralegh,</hi> a Man of great Wit, Military, and a Sword-man. Now whether theſe Things were bred in a hollow

Tree, I leave to them to ſpeak of, who can ſpeak far better than myſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> Edward Coke, the King's Attorney.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt firſt, My Lords, before I come to the Cauſe, give one Caution; becauſe we ſhall often mention Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of eminent Places, ſome of them great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs: Whatever we ſay of them, we ſhall but repeat what others have ſaid of them; I mean the capital Offenders in their Confeſſions: We, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing Law, muſt ſpeak reverently of Kings and Potentates. I perceive theſe honourable Lords, and the reſt of this great Aſſembly, are come to hear what hath been ſcattered upon the Wreck of Report. We carry a juſt Mind, to condemn no Man, but upon plain Evidence. Here is Miſchief, Miſchief <hi>in ſummo gradu,</hi> exorbitant Miſchief. My Speech ſhall chiefly touch theſe three Points; Imitation, Supportation, and Defence.</p>
               <p>The Imitation of Evil ever exceeds the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as on the contrary, Imitation of Good ever comes ſhort. Miſchief cannot be ſupported, but by Miſchief: Yea, it will ſo multiply, that it will bring all to Confuſion. Miſchief is ever underprop'd by Falſhood of foul Practices. And becauſe all theſe Things did concur in theſe Treaſons, you ſhall underſtand the Main, as before you did the Bye.</p>
               <p>The Treaſon of the Bye, conſiſteth in theſe Points: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Lord <hi>Grey, Brook, Markham,</hi> and the reſt, intended by Force in the Night, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the King's Court; which was a Rebellion in the Heart of the Realm, yea, in the Heart of the Heart, in the Court. They intended to make him, that is a Sovereign, ſubject to their Power, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to open the Doors with Muſquets and Calivers, and to take alſo the Prince and Council. Then, under the King's Authority, to carry the King to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and to make a <hi>State of the Admiral:</hi> When they had the King there, to extort three
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:0181500200:544"/>
Things from him. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Pardon for all their Treaſons. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Toleration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Superſtition: Which their Eyes ſhall ſooner fall out, than they ſhall ever ſee; for the King hath ſpoken theſe Words in the hearing of many, <hi>I will loſe the Crown and my Life, before ever I will alter Religion.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To remove Counſellors: In the Room of the Lord Chancellor, they would have placed one <hi>Watſon</hi> a Prieſt, abſurd in Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ignorant in Divinity. <hi>Brook,</hi> of whom I will ſpeak nothing, Lord Treaſurer; the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary muſt be <hi>Markham, Oculus Patriae.</hi> A Hole muſt be found in my Lord Chief Juſtice's Coat. <hi>Grey</hi> muſt be Earl Marſhal and Maſter of the Horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would have a Table in the Court: Marry, he would advance the Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> to a higher Place. All this cannot be done without a Multitude. Therefore <hi>Watſon</hi> the Prieſt telleth a reſolute Man, That the King was in Danger of Puritans and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; ſo to bring him in Blindfold into the Action; ſaying, That the King is no King till he be crown'd, therefore every Man might right his own Wrongs: But he is <hi>Rex Natus,</hi> his Dignity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends as well as yours, my Lords. Then <hi>Watſon</hi> impoſeth a blaſphemous Oath, that they ſhould ſwear to defend the King's Perſon, to keep ſecret what was given them in Charge, and ſeek all Ways and Means to advance the Catholick Religion. Then they intend to ſend for the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, in the King's Name, to the <hi>Tower,</hi> leſt they ſhould make any Reſiſtance, and then to take Hoſtages of them; and to enjoin them to provide for them Victuals and Munition. <hi>Grey,</hi> becauſe the King removed before <hi>Midſummer,</hi> had a further Reach, to get a Company of Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men to aſſiſt the Action: Therefore he would ſtay till he had obtain'd a Regiment from <hi>Oſtend</hi> or <hi>Auſtria.</hi> So you ſee, theſe Treaſons were like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes,
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:0181500200:545"/>
which were joined in their Tails, tho' their Heads were ſever'd.</p>

               <p>You are not: My Lords, you ſhall obſerve three Things in the Treaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They had a Watch-Word (the King's Safety); their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was <hi>Bonum in ſe,</hi> their Intent was <hi>Malum in ſe. Secondly,</hi> They avouched Scripture; both the Prieſts had, <hi>Scriptum eſt;</hi> perverting and ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaking the Scriptures. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Common Law to prove, That he was no King till he was crowned, alledging a Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> This, by Way of Imitation, hath been the Courſe of all Traytors.</p>
               <p>In the 20th of <hi>Edward</hi> II. <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Queen, and the Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> gave out, That the King's Perſon was not ſafe, for the Good of the Church and Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle</hi> did preach on this Text, <hi>My Head is grieved;</hi> meaning by the Head, the King; that when the Head began to be negligent, the People might reform what is amifs.</p>
               <p>In the 3d of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. Sir <hi>Roger Claringdon,</hi> accompanied with two Prieſts, gave out, that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> II. was alive, when he was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> III. cauſed <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Head to be cut off, for giving Couuſel to murther the King.</p>
               <p>The 3d of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. Sir <hi>Henry Stanley</hi> found the Crown in the Duſt, and ſet it on the King's Head. When <hi>Fitzwater</hi> and <hi>Garret</hi> told him, that <hi>Edward</hi> V. was alive, he ſaid, <hi>If he be alive, I will aſſiſt him:</hi> But this coſt him his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund de la Pole,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> killed a Man in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. for which the King would have him hold up his Hand at the Bar, and then pardoned him. Yet he took ſuch Offence
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:0181500200:546"/>
thereat, that he ſent to the Noblemen, to help to reform the Commonwealth; and then ſaid, he would go to <hi>France</hi> and get Power there. Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Compton</hi> knew all the Treaſon, and diſcovered <hi>Windon</hi> and others that were attainted.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, there was another Thing that would be ſtood upon, namely, that they had but one Witneſs; then he vouched one <hi>Appleyard</hi>'s Caſe <hi>(Temp.

               <p>A third Sort of Evidence there is likewiſe, and this is held more forcible than either of the other two; and that is, when a Man, by his Accuſation of another, ſhall, by the ſame Accuſation, alſo condemn himſelf, and make himſelf liable to the ſame Fault and Puniſhment: This is more forcible than many Witneſſes. So then, ſo much by Way of Imitation. Then he defined Treaſon: There is Treaſon in the Heart, in the Hand, in the Mouth, in Conſummation; comparing that <hi>in Corde</hi> to the Root of a Tree; <hi>in Ore,</hi> to the Bud; <hi>in Manu,</hi> to the Bloſſom; and that which is <hi>in Conſummatione,</hi> to the Fruit.</p>

               <p>Yes, when we deliver the Proofs to be read. <hi>Ralegh</hi> procured <hi>Cobham</hi> to go to <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> which he did by his Inſtigation: <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with <hi>Cobham</hi> before he went to <hi>Aremberg;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper, <hi>Ralegh</hi> conducted him to <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe; from whence <hi>Cobham</hi> went with <hi>Lawrency,</hi> a Servant of <hi>Aremberg</hi>'s, unto him, and went in by a Back-way. <hi>Cobham</hi> could never be quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had entertain'd this Motion, for he had four Letters from <hi>Ralegh. Aremberg</hi> anſwered, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould be performed, but knew not to whom it ſhould be diſtributed. Then <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> came back to <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe, where they found <hi>Ralegh. Cobham</hi> and <hi>Ralegh</hi> went up, and left <hi>Lawrency</hi> below, where they had ſecret Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in a Gallery, and after <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Lawrency</hi> departed from <hi>Ralegh.</hi> Your Jargon was Peace! What is that? <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion, <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Subverſion. And again, you are not a fit Man to take ſo much Money for procuring of a lawful Peace, for Peace procured by Money is diſhonourable. Then <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> muſt go to <hi>Spain,</hi> and return by <hi>Jerſey,</hi> where you were Captain: And then, becauſe <hi>Cobham</hi> had not ſo much Policy, or at leaſt Wickedneſs, as you, he muſt have your Advice for the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Money. Would you have depoſed ſo good a King, lineally deſcended of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter of <hi>Edward</hi> IV: Why then muſt you ſet up another?

               <p>By this Book, you would perſuade Men, that he is not the lawful King. Now let us conſider ſome Circumſtances: My Lords, you know my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> (for whom we all lament, and rejoice; lament in that his Houſe, which hath ſtood ſo long unſpotted, is now ruinated: Rejoice, in that his Treaſons are revealed) is neither Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian nor Sword-man; <hi>Ralegh</hi> was both, united in the Cauſe with him, and therefore Cauſe of his Deſtruction. Another Circumſtance is, the ſecret contriving of it. <hi>Humphry Stafford</hi> claimed Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for Treaſon, <hi>Ralegh</hi> in his <hi>Machiavilian</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath made a Sanctuary for Treaſon. He muſt talk with none but <hi>Cobham,</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) one Witneſs can never condemn me. For <hi>Brook</hi> ſaid unto Sir <hi>Griffith Markham,</hi> take heed how you do make my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> acquainted; for whatſoever he knoweth, <hi>Ralegh</hi> the Witch will get it out of him. As ſoon as <hi>Ralegh</hi> was examined on one Point of Treaſon concerning my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> he wrote to him thus; <hi>I have been examined of you, and confeſſed nothing.</hi> Further, you ſent to him
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:0181500200:550"/>
by your truſty <hi>Francis Kemiſh,</hi> that one Witneſs could not condemn; and therefore bad his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip be of good Courage. Came this out of <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Quiver? No: But out of <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velian</hi> and Deviliſh Policy. Yea, but <hi>Cobham</hi> did retract it: Why then did you urge it? Now then ſee the moſt horrible Practices that ever came out of the bottomleſs Pit of the loweſt Hell. After that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had Intelligence that <hi>Cobham</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him, he endeavoured to have Intelligence from <hi>Cobham,</hi> which he had gotten by young Sir <hi>John Payton:</hi> But I think it was the Error of his Youth.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Thus <hi>Cobham,</hi> by the Inſtigation of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> entred into theſe Actions: So that the Queſtion will be, Whether you are not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Traytor, and he would nevertheleſs have entred into it? Why did <hi>Cobham</hi> retract all that ſame? <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Ralegh</hi> was ſo odious, he thought he ſhould fare the worſe for his Sake. 2<hi>dly,</hi> He thought thus with himſelf, if he be free, I ſhall clear myſelf the better. After this, <hi>Cobham</hi> aſked for a Preacher to confer with, pretending to have Dr. <hi>Andrews;</hi> but indeed, he meant not to have him, but Mr. <hi>Galloway,</hi> a worthy and reverend Preacher, who can do more with the King (as he ſaid) than any other; that he, ſeeing his conſtant Denial, might inform the King thereof. Here he plays with the Preacher. If <hi>Ralegh</hi> could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Lords, that <hi>Cobham</hi> had no Intent to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, then he thought all ſhould be well. Here is Forgery. In the Tower, <hi>Cobham</hi> muſt write to Sir <hi>Thomas Vane,</hi> a worthy Man, That he meant not to go into <hi>Spain;</hi> which Letter <hi>Ralegh</hi> deviſed in <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Name.</p>

               <p>At my firſt Examination at <hi>Windſor,</hi> my Lords aſked me, what I knew of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Practice with <hi>Aremberg;</hi> I anſwered negatively: And as concerning <hi>Arabella,</hi> I proteſt before God, I never heard one Word of it. If that be proved, let me be guilty of a thouſand Treaſons.

               <p>After being examined, I told my Lords, that I thought my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had Conference with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> l ſuſpected his viſiting of him: For after he departed from me at <hi>Durham</hi> Houſe, I ſaw him paſs by his own Stairs, and paſſed over to St. <hi>Mary-Saviours,</hi> where I knew <hi>Lawrency</hi> a Merchant, and a Follower of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> and therefore likely to go unto him. My Lord <hi>Cecil</hi> aſked my Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lawrency;</hi> I ſaid, That if you do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Lawrency,</hi> it is dangerous, he will fly; if you do apprehend him, you ſhall give my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> Notice thereof. I was aſked likewiſe, Who was the greateſt Man with my Lord <hi>Cobham?</hi> I anſwered, I knew no Man ſo great with him, as young <hi>Wyat</hi> of <hi>Kent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaw my Letter to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Dealing with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> in his Fury he accuſed me; but before he came to the Stair-foot he repented him, and ſaid, he had done me wrong. When he came to the End of his Accuſation, he added, That if he had brought this Money to <hi>Jerſey,</hi> that I would have delivered him and the Money to the King. Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> You ſaid this never came out of <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Quiver, he is a ſimple Man: Is he ſo ſimple? No: He hath Diſpoſitions of his own, he will not eaſily be guided by others, but when he has once taken Head in a Matter, he is not eaſily drawn from it; he is no Babe. But it is ſtrange for me to deviſe with <hi>Cobham,</hi> that he

ſhould go to <hi>Spain,</hi> to perſuade the King to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe ſo much Money, he being a Man of no Love in <hi>England,</hi> and I having reſigned my Room of chiefeſt Command, the Wardenſhip of the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries:</hi> Is it not ſtrange for me, to make myſelf <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> or a <hi>Kitt,</hi> or a <hi>Cade;</hi> I knowing <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be in better Eſtate to defend itſelf than ever it was. I knew <hi>Scotland</hi> united, <hi>Ireland</hi> quieted, <hi>Denmark</hi> aſſured, which before was ſuſpected. I knew that having loſt a Lady whom Time had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, we had now an active King, a lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. The State of <hi>Spain</hi> was not unknown to me. I had written a Diſcourſe, which I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to preſent unto the King, againſt Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> I knew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſix Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, three in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and three at Sea, and once in 1588 at <hi>Cales,</hi> by my Lord Admiral. I knew he was diſcouraged and diſhonoured. I knew the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be the proudeſt Prince liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but now he cometh creeping to the King my Maſter for Peace. I knew, whereas before he had in his Ports ſix or ſeven Score Sail of Ships, he hath now but ſix or ſeven. I knew of twenty-five Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions he had from his <hi>Indies,</hi> he hath ſcarce one left. I knew him ſo poor, that the Jeſuits in <hi>Spain,</hi> who were wont to have ſuch large Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, were fain to beg at the Church-door. Was it ever read or heard, that any Prince ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe ſo much Money, without a ſufficient Pawn? I knew her own Subjects, the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> would not lend her Majeſty Money, without Lands in Mortgage. I knew the Queen did not lend the <hi>States</hi> Money, without <hi>Fluſhing, Brill,</hi> and other Towns for a Pawn. And can it be thought, he would let <hi>Cobham</hi> have ſo great a Sum?</p>
               <p>I never came to the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s, but about Matters of his Profit, as the ordering of his Houſe, paying of his Servants Board-wages, &amp;c. I had
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:0181500200:555"/>
of his when I was examined, four thouſand Pounds worth of Jewels for a Purchaſe; a Pearl of three thouſand Pounds, and a Ring worth five hundred Pounds: If he had had a Fancy to run away, he would not have left ſo much to have purchaſed a Leaſe in Fee-farm. I ſaw him buy three hundred Pounds worth of Books, to ſend to his Library at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a Cabinet of thirty Pounds to give to Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> for drawing the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; and God in Heaven knoweth, not I, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he intended to travel. But for that Practice with <hi>Arabella,</hi> or Letters to <hi>Aremberg,</hi> or any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, or in what Language he ſpake unto him; if I knew any of theſe Things, I would abſolutely confeſs the Indictment, and acknowledge myſelf worthy a thouſand Deaths.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> being required to ſubſcribe to an Examination, there was ſhewed a Note under <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi>'s Hand, the which when he had peruſed, he pauſed, and after brake forth into theſe Speeches: Oh Villain! Oh Traytor! I will now tell you all the Truth! And then ſaid, His Purpoſe was to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders</hi> and into <hi>Spain,</hi> for the obtaining the aforeſaid Money, and that, <hi>Ralegh</hi> had appointed to meet him in <hi>Jerſey</hi> as he returned home, to be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of him about the Diſtribution of the Money.</q>

                  <hi>Popham, Lord Chief Juſtice.</hi> When <hi>Cobham</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the Interrogatories, he made ſcruple to ſubſcribe; and being urged to it, he ſaid, if he might hear me affirm, that a Perſon of his Degree ought to ſet his Hand, he would; I lying then at <hi>Richmond,</hi> for Fear of the Plague, was ſent for, and I told him he ought to ſubſcribe; otherwiſe it were a Contempt of a high Nature: <hi>Then he ſubſcribed.</hi> The Lords queſtioned with him further, and he ſhewed them a Letter, as I thought written to me, but it was indeed written to my Lord <hi>Cecil:</hi> He deſired to ſee the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:0181500200:556"/>
Letter again, and then ſaid, Oh Wretch! Oh Traytor! Whereby I perceived you had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Truſt he had repoſed in you.</p>

               <p>He is as paſſionate a Man as lives, for he hath not ſpared the beſt Friends he hath in <hi>England</hi> in his Paſſion. My Lords, I take it, he that hath been examined, hath ever been aſked at the Time of his Examination, if it be according to his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then to ſubſcribe. Methinks, my Lords, when he accuſes a Man, he ſhould give ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and Reaſon of it; it is not ſufficient to ſay, we talked of it. If I had been the Plotter, would not I have given <hi>Cobham</hi> ſome Arguments, whereby to perſuade the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and anſwer his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.

               <speaker>Lord Cecil.</speaker>
               <p>I am in great Diſpute with my ſelf, to ſpeak in the Caſe of this Gentleman: A former Dearneſs between me and him ty'd ſo firm a Knot of my Conceit of his Virtues, now broken by a Diſcovery of his Imperfections. I proteſt, did I ſerve a King that I knew would be diſpleaſed with me for ſpeaking, in this Caſe I would ſpeak, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever came of it: But ſeeing he is compacted of Piety and Juſtice, and one that will not miſlike any Man for ſpeaking a Truth, I will anſwer your Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was ſtaid by me at <hi>Windſor,</hi> upon the firſt News of <hi>Copley,</hi> that the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be ſurpriz'd by my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Brook;</hi> when I found <hi>Brook</hi> was in, I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>Cobham,</hi> then I doubted <hi>Ralegh</hi> to be a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker. I ſpeak not this that it ſhould be thought
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:0181500200:557"/>
I had greater Judgment than the Reſt of my Lords, in making this Haſte to have him examin'd; <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh</hi> following to <hi>Windſor,</hi> I met with him upon the Terrace, and willed him, as from the King, to ſtay, ſaying, The Lords had ſomething to ſay to him: Then he was examined, but not concerning my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> but of the ſurprizing Treaſon; my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> was apprehended, and likewiſe <hi>Brook;</hi> by <hi>Brook</hi> we found, that he had given Notice to <hi>Cobham</hi> of the ſurprizing Treaſon as he deliver'd it to us, but with as much Sparingneſs of a Brother as he might: We ſent for my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where he ſtood upon his Juſtification, and his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſometimes being froward, he ſaid he was not bound to ſubſcribe, wherewith we made the King acquainted. <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaid, if my Lord Chief Juſtice would ſay it were a Contempt, he would ſubſcribe; whereof being reſolved, he ſubſcribed. There was a Light given to <hi>Aremberg,</hi> that <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> was examined; but that <hi>Ralegh</hi> knew that <hi>Cobham</hi> was examined, is more than I know.</p>

               <p>If my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had truſted me in the Main, was not I as fit a Man to be truſted in the Bye?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ralegh</hi> did by Letter acquaint us, that my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> had ſent <hi>Lawrency</hi> to <hi>Aremberg,</hi> when he knew not he had any Dealings with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord H. Howard.</speaker>
               <p>It made for you, if <hi>Lawrency</hi> had been only acquainted with <hi>Cobham,</hi> and not with you. But you knew his whole Eſtate, and were acquainted with <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Practice with <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency;</hi> and it was known to you before, that <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> depended on <hi>Aremberg.</hi>

<pb n="548" facs="tcp:0181500200:558"/>
ſay, you ſuſpected the Intelligence that <hi>Cobham</hi> had with <hi>Aremberg</hi> by <hi>Lawrency.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralegh.</speaker>
               <p>I thought it had been no other Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but ſuch as might be warranted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Attorney.</speaker>
               <p>Then it was but lawful Suſpicion. But to that whereas you ſaid, That <hi>Cobham</hi> had accuſed you on Paſſion, I anſwer three Ways. 1. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd when <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaid, Let me ſee the Letter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he pauſed, and when he did ſee that Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> was touch'd, he cry'd out, <hi>O Traytor! O Villain! now will I confeſs the whole Truth.</hi> 2. The Accuſation of a Man on Hear ſay, is nothing: Would he accuſe himſelf on Paſſion, and ruinate his Cauſe and Poſterity, out of Malice to accuſe you? 3. Could this be out of Paſſion? Mark the Manner of it: <hi>Cobham</hi> had told this at leaſt two Months before to his Brother <hi>Brook, You are Fools, you are on the Bye,</hi> Ralegh <hi>and I are on the Main, we mean to take away the King and his Cubs;</hi> this he deliver'd two Months before. So mark the Manner and the Matter; he would not turn the Weapon againſt his own Brother, and accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to accuſe you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralegh.</speaker>
               <p>Hath <hi>Cobham</hi> confeſſed that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>This is ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> to prove that <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Speech came not out of Paſſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralegh.</speaker>
               <p>Let it be proved that <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaid ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Attorney.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaith, he was a long Time doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> that he would ſend him and the Money to the King. Did <hi>Cobham</hi> fear leſt you would betray him in <hi>Jerſey?</hi> Then of Neceſſity there muſt be Truſt between you. No Man can betray a Man, but he that is truſted, in my Underſtanding. This is the greateſt Argument to prove, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Proceedings. <hi>Ralegh</hi> hath a deeper Reach than to make himſelf, as he ſaid, <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> a <hi>Ket,</hi> or <hi>Cade;</hi> yet I never heard
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:0181500200:559"/>
that <hi>Robin Hood</hi> was a Traytor; they ſay he was an Outlaw. And whereas he ſaith, that our King is not only more wealthy and potent than his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, but alſo more politick and wiſe, ſo that he could have no Hope to prevail: I anſwer, there is no King ſo potent, wiſe, and active, but he may be overtaken through Treaſon. Whereas you ſay, <hi>Spain</hi> is ſo poor; diſcourſing ſo largely thereof, it had been better for you to have kept in <hi>Guiana,</hi> than to have been ſo well acquainted with the State of <hi>Spain.</hi> Beſides, if you could have brought <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to have joined, you might have had Hope to prevail. For his ſix Overthrows, I anſwer, he hath the more Malice, becauſe Repulſes breed Deſire of Revenge. Then you ſay, you never talk'd with <hi>Cobham</hi> but about Leaſes, and letting Lands, and ordering his Houſe; I never knew you Clerk of the Kitchen, &amp;c. If you had fallen on your Knees at firſt, and confeſſed the Treaſon, it had been better for you. You ſay, he meant to have given me a Cabinet of thirty Pounds; perhaps he thought by thoſe Means, to have anticipated me therewith. But you ſay, all theſe are Circumſtances. I anſwer, all this Accuſation in Circumſtance is true: Here now I might appeal to my Lords, that you take hold of this, that he ſubſcribed not to the Accuſation.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cobham</hi> was not then preſſed to ſubſcribe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Attorney.</speaker>
               <p>His Accuſation being teſtified by the Lords, is of as great Force, as if he had ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaith again, if the Accuſer be alive, he muſt be brought Face to Face to ſpeak, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. That there muſt be two ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Witneſſes that muſt be brought Face to Face before the accuſed, and alledgeth 10, and 13 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi>

A Judge condemned a Woman in <hi>Sarum,</hi> for killing her Huſband, on the Teſtimony of one Witneſs; afterwards his Man confeſſed the Murder, when ſhe was executed.

               <p>If Chriſt requireth it, as it appeareth, <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. If by the Statute, Civil Law, and God's Word, it be required that there muſt be two Witneſſes at the leaſt; bear with me if I deſire one.</p>
               <p>I would not deſire to live, if I were privy to <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Proceedings: I had been a Slave, a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, a Fool, if I had endeavoured to ſet up <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> and refuſed ſo gracious a Lord and Soveraign.

               <p>You have offered Queſtions on divers Statutes, all which mention two Accuſers in Caſe of Indictments; you have deceived your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the Laws of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. and 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. are repeal'd. It ſufficeth now, if there be Proofs made either under Hand, or by Teſtimony of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, or by Oaths; it needs not the Subſcription of the Party, ſo there be Hands of credible Men, to teſtify the Examination.</p>

               <p>It may be an Error in me, and if thoſe Laws be repeal'd, yet I hope the Equity of thoſe Laws remains ſtill; but if you affirm it, it muſt be a Law to Poſterity; the Proof of the common Law is by Witneſs and Jury; let <hi>Cobham</hi> be here, let him ſpeak it: Call my Accuſer before my Face, and I have done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Attorney.</speaker>
               <p>Further, in his Examination, he ſaith, Nothing could be ſet down for the Diſtribution of the Money to the Diſcontented, without Conference with <hi>Ralegh.</hi> You ſaid, it ſhould have been for Procurement of Peace, but it was for raiſing Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Further, <hi>Cobham</hi> ſaith, He would never have entred into theſe Courſes, but by your Inſtigation, and that you would never let him alone. Your Scholar was not apt enough to tell us all the Plots; that is enough for you to do, that are his Maſter: You intended to truſt Sir <hi>Arthur Savage,</hi> whom I

For he told me, If I would agree to further the Peace, he would get me 8000 Crowns. I aſked him, Who ſhall have the reſt of the Money? He ſaid, I will offer ſuch a Nobleman (who was not named) ſome of the Money. I ſaid, He will not be perſuaded by you, and will extremely hate you for ſuch a Motion. Let me be pinched to Death with hot Irons, if ever I knew there was any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to beſtow the Money on diſcontented Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I had made a Diſcourſe againſt the Peace, and would have printed it: if <hi>Cobham</hi> changed his Mind, if the Prieſts, if <hi>Brook</hi> had any ſuch Intent, what is that to me?

               <p>I muſt judge the beſt. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of his Brother was not voluntary; he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every Thing as much as he could, to ſave his Brother.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Examination read.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, he had a Book written againſt the Title of the King, which he had of <hi>Ralegh,</hi> and that he gave it to his Brother: <hi>Ralegh</hi> ſaid, it was fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Attorney.</speaker>
               <p>After the King came within twelve Miles of <hi>London, Cobham</hi> never came to ſee him, and intended to travel without ſeeing the Queen, ahd the Prince. Now in this Diſcontentment, you gave him the Book, and he gave it to his Brother.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralegh.</speaker>
               <p>I never gave it him, he took it off my Table. For I well remember, a little before that Time, I received a Challenge from Sir <hi>Amias Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and for that I did intend to anſwer it, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to leave my Eſtate ſettled, therefore laid out all my looſe Papers, amongſt which was this Book.</p>

<pb n="566" facs="tcp:0181500200:576"/>
the Jury hath heard the Matter.

               <p>If <hi>Cobham</hi> did practiſe with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> how could it not but be known in <hi>Spain?</hi> Why did they name the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with <hi>Jack Straw</hi>'s Treaſon, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> with <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> but that it was to countenance his Treaſon?</p>
               <p>Conſider, you Gentlemen of the Jury, there is no Cauſe ſo doubtful, which the King's Council cannot make good againſt the Law. Conſider my Diſability, and their Ability: They prove nothing againſt me, only they bring the Accuſation of my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> which he hath lamented and repented as heartily, as if it had been for a horrible Murther. For he knew, that all this Sorrow which ſhould come to me, is by his Means. Preſumptions muſt proceed from precedent or ſubſequent Facts. I have ſpent 40000 Crowns againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> I had not purchaſed forty Pounds a Year. If I had
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:0181500200:577"/>
died in <hi>Guiana</hi> I had not left 300 Marks a Year to my Wife and Son. I that have always condemn'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, methinks it is a ſtrange Thing that now I ſhould affect it. Remember what St. <hi>Auſting</hi> ſays, <hi>Sic judicate tanquam, ab alio mox ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandi, unus judex, unum tribunal.</hi> If you would be contented, on Preſumptions, to be delivered up to be ſlaughter'd, to have your Wives and Children turned into the Streets to beg their Bread; if you would be contented to be ſo judged, judge ſo of me.</p>

               <p>I hope to make this ſo clear, as that the Wit of Man ſhall have no Colour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it. The Matter is Treaſon in the higheſt Degree, the End to deprive the King of his Crown. The particular Treaſons are theſe: <hi>Firſt,</hi> To raiſe up Rebellion; and, to effect that, to procure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to raiſe up Tumults in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by divulging a treaſonable Book againſt the King's Right to the Crown; the Purpoſe, to take the Life of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and his Iſſue. My Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> confeſſeth Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> to be guilty of all theſe Treaſons. The Queſtion is, Whether he be guilty as joining with him, or inſtigating of him? The Courſe to prove this, was by my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Accuſation. If that be true, he is guilty; if not, he is clear. So whether <hi>Cobham</hi> ſay true, or <hi>Ralegh?</hi> That is the Queſtion. <hi>Ralegh</hi> hath no Anſwer, but the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of as much Wit, as the Wit of Man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. He uſeth his bare Denial; the Denial of a Defendant muſt not move the Jury. In the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> or in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> for Matter of Title, if the Defendant be called in Queſtion, his Denial on his Oath is no Evidence to the Court to clear him, he doth it in <hi>propria Cauſa.</hi> Therefore much leſs in Matters of Treaſon. <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Teſtiſication againſt him before then, and ſince, hath been largely diſcourſed.</p>

               <p>Well, I will now make it appear to the World, that there never lived a viler Viper up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Face of the Earth than thou; <hi>and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al drew a Letter out of his Pocket, ſaying further,</hi> My Lords, you ſhall ſee this is an Agent, that hath writ a Treatiſe againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and hath ever ſo deteſted him; this is he that hath ſpent ſo much Money againſt him in Service; and yet you ſhall all ſee, whether his Heart be not wholly <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi> The Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who, of his own Nature was a good and honourable Gentleman, till over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by this Wretch, now finding his Conſcience heavily burthened with ſome Courſes, which the Subtilty of this Traytor had drawn him into, my Lords, he could not be at Reſt with himſelf, nor quiet in his Thoughts, until he was eaſed of that heavy Weight; out of which Paſſion of his Mind, and Diſcharge of his Duty to his Prince, and his Conſcience to God, taking it upon his Salvation, that he wrote nothing but the Truth, with his own Hands he wrote this Letter. Now, Sir, you ſhall ſee whether you had Intelligence with <hi>Cobham</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four Days before he came to the <hi>Tower.</hi> If he be wholly <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> that deſired a Penſion of 1500 Pounds a Year from <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Spain</hi> by him might have Intelligence, then <hi>Ralegh</hi> is a Traytor.

What tho' <hi>Cobham</hi> retracted, yet he could not re&amp;;st nor ſleep, until he had confirmed it again.

            <p>I have thought it fit, to ſet down this to my Lords, wherein I profeſs on my Soul, to write nothing but the Truth. I am come new near to the Period of my Time, therefore I confeſs the Truth before God, and his Angels. <hi>Ralegh,</hi> four Days before I came to the <hi>Tower,</hi> cauſed an Apple <hi>(Eve's Apple)</hi> to be thrown in at my Chamber window; the Effect of it was to intreat me to right the Wrong that I had done him, in ſaying, That I ſhould have come home by <hi>Jerſey;</hi> which under my Hand to him. I have retracted. His firſt Letter I anſwered not, which was thrown in the ſame Manner, wherein he prayed me to write him a Letter, which I did. He ſent me Word, that the Judges were at Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi>'s Houſe, and that there was good Hope the Proceedings againſt us ſhould be ſtaid; he ſent me another Time a little Tobacco. At <hi>Aremberg</hi>'s coming, <hi>Ralegh</hi> dealt with me, to procure him a Penſion of <hi>1500</hi> Pounds a Year, for which he promiſed that no Action ſhould be againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> but he would give Knowledge before-hand. He
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:0181500200:581"/>
told me the <hi>States</hi> had Audience with the King. <hi>(Ah, is not this a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Heart, in an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Body?)</hi> He hath been the original Cauſe of my Ruin; for I had no Dealing with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> but by his Inſtigation. He hath been alſo the Cauſe of my Diſcontentment; he adviſed me, not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with Preachers, as <hi>Eſſex</hi> was, and that the King would better allow of a conſtant Denial, than to accuſe any.</p>

               <p>Yes, of Mr. <hi>Attorney.</hi> I deſire, my Lords, to remember three Things to the King. 1. I was accuſed to be a Practiſer for <hi>Spain:</hi> I never knew, that my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> meant to go thither; I will aſk no Mercy at the King's Hands, if he will affirm it. 2. I never knew of the Practice with <hi>Arabella.</hi> 3. I never knew of my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Practice with <hi>Aremberg,</hi> nor of the ſurpriſing Treaſon.</p>

               <p>In my Conſcience I am perſuaded, that <hi>Cobham</hi> hath accuſed you truly. You cannot deny, but that you were dealt with, to have a Penſion to be a Spy for <hi>Spain;</hi> therefore you are not ſo true to the King, as you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted yourſelf to be.</p>

               <p>I ſubmit myſelf to the King's Mercy; I know his Mercy is greater than my Offence. I

recommend my Wife, and Son, of tender Years, unbrought up, to his Compaſſion.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>I had thought I ſhould never have ſeen this Day, to have ſtood in this Place, to give Sentence of Death againſt you; becauſe I thought it impoſſible, that one of ſo great Parts ſhould have fallen ſo grievouſly. God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you many Benefits. You had been a Man fit, and able, to have ſerved the King in good Place. You had brought yourſelf into a good State of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: If you had entered into a good Conſideration of your Eſtate, and not ſuffered your own Wit to have entrapped yourſelf, you might have lived in good Comfort. It is beſt for Man not to ſeek to climb too high, leſt he fall; nor yet to creep too low, leſt he be trodden on. It was the Poſie of the wiſeſt and greateſt Counſellor of his Time, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, In medio ſpatio mediocria firma locantur.</hi> You might have lived well with 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, for ſo I have heard your Revenues to be. I know nothing might move you to be diſcontented; but, if you had been down, you know Fortune's Wheel, when it is turned about, riſeth again. I never heard, that the King took away any Thing from you, but the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainſhip of the Guard, which he did with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to have one of his own Knowledge, whom he might truſt in that Place. You have been taken for a wiſe Man, and ſo have ſhewed Wit enough this Day. Again, for Monopolies for Wine, &amp;c. If the King ſaid, <hi>It is a Matter that offends my People, ſhould I burthen them for your particular good?</hi> I think, you could not well take it hardly, that his Subjects were eaſed, tho' by your private Hindrance. Two Vices have lodged chiefly in you; one is an eager Ambition; the other corrupt Covetouſneſs. Ambition, in deſiring to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to equal Grace and Favour, as you have been before time; that Grace you had then, you got
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:0181500200:585"/>
not in a Day or Year. For your Covetouſneſs, I am ſorry to hear that a Gentleman of your Wealth ſhould become a baſe Spy for the Enemy, which is the vileſt of all other; wherein, on my Conſcience, <hi>Cobham</hi> hath ſaid true: By it you would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed your Living 1500 <hi>l.</hi> a Year. This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs is like a Canker, that eats the Iron-place where it lives. Your Caſe being thus, let it not grieve you, if I ſpeak a little out of Zeal, and Love, to your Good. You have been taxed by the World, with the Defence of moſt heatheniſh and blaſphemous Opinions, which I liſt not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, becauſe Chriſtian Ears cannot endure to hear them, nor the Authors and Maintainers of them be ſuffered to live in any Chriſtian Common-wealth. You know what Men ſaid of <hi>Harpool.</hi> You ſhall do well before you go out of the World, to give Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction therein, and not to die with theſe Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on you. Let not any Devil perſuade you to think, there is no Eternity in Heaven; if you think thus, you ſhall find Eternity in Hell-fire. In the firſt Accuſation of my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Manner of ſpeaking: I proteſt before the Living God, I am perſuaded he ſpoke nothing but the Truth. You wrote, that he ſhould not in any Caſe confeſs any Thing to a Preacher, telling him an Example of my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that noble Earl that is gone; who, if he had not been carried away with others, had lived in Honour to this Day among us. He confeſſed his Offences, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mercy of the Lord; for I am verily perſuaded in my Heart, he died a worthy Servant of God. Your Conceit of not confeſſing any Thing, is very inhuman and wicked. In this World is the Time of confeſſing, that we may be abſolved at the Day of Judgment. You have ſhewed a fearful Sign of denying God, in adviſing a Man not to confeſs. It now comes in my Mind, why you may not have
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:0181500200:586"/>
your Accuſer Face to Face; for ſuch a one is eaſily brought to retract, when he ſeeth there is no Hope of his own Life. It is dangerous that any Traytors ſhould have any Accefs one to another, or Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; when they ſee themſelves muſt die, they will think it beſt to ſee their Fellow live, that he may commit the like Treaſon again, and ſo in ſome Sort ſeek Revenge.</p>
               <p>Now it reſteth to pronounce the Judgment, which I wiſh you had not been this Day to have received of me: For, if the Fear of God in you had been anſwerable to your other great Parts, you might have lived to have been a ſingular good Subject. I never ſaw the like Trial, and I hope, I ſhall never ſee the like again.</p>
