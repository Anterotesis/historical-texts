            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN requeſting your permiſſion to addreſs the
following pages to you, which as they
aim themſelves to be critical, require every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and allowance that approving taſte or
friendly prejudice can give them, I yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to mention no other motive than the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of private friendſhip and eſteem. Had
I ſuggeſted a hope that your implied approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would give a ſanction to their defects,
your particular reſerve, and diſlike to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of critical taſte, as well as of poetical
talent, would have made you refuſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of your name to ſuch a purpoſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I am not ſo ungrateful as now to attempt
to combat this diſpoſition in you. I ſhall not
here preſume to argue that the preſent ſtate
of poetry claims and expects every aſſiſtance
that taſte and example can afford it: nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to prove that a faſtidious concealment
of the moſt elegant productions of judgment and
fancy is an ill return for the poſſeſſion of thoſe
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0778900300:3"/>
endowments.—Continue to deceive yourſelf in
the idea that you are known only to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
admired and regarded for the valuable
qualities that attach private friendſhips, and
the graceful talents that adorn converſation.
Enough of what you have written, has
ſtolen into full public notice to anſwer my
purpoſe; and you will, perhaps, be the only
perſon, converſant in elegant literature, who
ſhall read this addreſs and not perceive that by
publiſhing your particular approbation of the
following drama, I have a more intereſted object
than to boaſt the true reſpect and regard with

            <l>Sometimes, by evil counſellors, 'tis ſaid</l>
            <l>Like earth-born potentates have been miſled:</l>
            <l>In thoſe gay days of wickedneſs and wit,</l>
            <l>When Villiers criticiz'd what Dryden writ,</l>
            <l>The Tragick Queen, to pleaſe a taſteleſs crow'd,</l>
            <l>Had learn'd to bellow, rant, and roar ſo loud,</l>
            <l>That frighten'd Nature, her beſt friend before,</l>
            <l>The bluſt'ring beldam's company forſwore.</l>
            <l>Her comic Siſter, who had wit 'tis true,</l>
            <l>With all her merits, had her failings too;</l>
            <l>And would ſometimes in mirthful moments uſe</l>
            <l>A ſtyle too flippant for a well-bred Muſe.</l>
            <l>Then female modeſty abaſh'd began</l>
            <l>To ſeek the friendly refuge of the fan,</l>
            <l>Awhile behind that ſlight entrenchment ſtood,</l>

                  <p>No, no; you never will read any thing that's
worth liſtening to:—you hate to hear about your
country; there are letters every day with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſignatures, demonſtrating the certainty of
an invaſion, and proving that the nation is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
undone—But you never will read any
thing to entertain one.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. DANGLE.</speaker>
                  <p>And what have you to do with the theatre,
Mr. Dangle? Why ſhould you affect the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Critic? I have no patience with you!
—haven't you made yourſelf the jeſt of all your
acquaintance by your interference in matters
where you have no buſineſs? Are not you call'd
a theatrical Quidnunc, and a mock Maecenas to
ſecond-hand authors?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>DANGLE.</speaker>
                  <p>True; my power with the Managers is pretty
notorious; but is it no credit to have applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from all quarters for my intereſt?—From
lords to recommend fidlers, from ladies to get
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0778900300:10"/>
boxes, from authors to get anſwers, and from
actors to get engagements.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. DANGLE.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, truly; you have contrived to get a
ſhare in all the plague and trouble of theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
property, without the profit, or even the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the abuſe that attends it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>I am ſure, Mrs. Dangle, you are no loſer by
it, however; you have all the advantages of it:
—mightn't you, laſt winter, have had the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the new Pantomime a fortnight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to its performance? And doesn't Mr. Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook
let you take places for a play before it is
advertis'd, and ſet you down for a Box for
every new piece through the ſeaſon? And didn't
my friend, Mr. Smatter, dedicate his laſt Farce
to you at my particular requeſt, Mrs. Dangle?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. DANGLE.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but wasn't the Farce damn'd, Mr.
Dangle? And to be ſure it is extremely pleaſant
to have one's houſe made the motley rendezvous
of all the lackeys of literature!—The very high
change of trading authors and jobbing critics!—Yes,
my drawing-room is an abſolute regiſter-office
for candidate actors, and poets without
character;—then to be continually alarmed with
Miſſes and Ma'ams piping hiſteric changes on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0778900300:11"/>
JULIETS and DORINDAS, POLLYS and OPHELIAS;
and the very furniture trembling at the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
ſtarts and unprovok'd rants of would-be
RICHARDS and HAMLETS!—And what is worſe
than all, now that the Manager has monopoliz'd
the Opera-Houſe, haven't we the Signors and
Signioras calling here, ſliding their ſmooth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibreves,
and gargling glib diviſions in their
outlandiſh throats—with foreign emiſſaries and
French ſpies, for ought I know, diſguiſed like
fidlers and figure dancers!</p>

one of the Weſtminſter aſſociations—or trailing
a volunteer pike in the Artillery Ground!—But
you—o'my conſcience, I believe if the French

ſtudy better?—Beſides, you will not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade

in being at the head of a band of critics, who
take upon them to decide for the whole town,
whoſe opinion and patronage all writers ſolicit,

                  <p>Mrs. Dangle and I have been diverting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the papers.—Pray, Sneer, won't you
go to Drury-lane theatre the firſt night of
Puff's tragedy?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SNEER.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but I ſuppoſe one ſhan't be able to get
in, for on the firſt night of a new piece they
always fill the houſe with orders to ſupport it.
But here, Dangle, I have brought you two
pieces, one of which you muſt exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to make the Managers accept, I can tell
you that, for 'tis written by a perſon of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

                  <p>Aye, I am glad of it, for now you'll be

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0778900300:14"/>
to ſee how you enjoy your volunteer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,

                  <p>It's a great trouble—yet, egad, its pleaſant
too.—Why, ſometimes of a morning, I have a

whoſe faces I never ſaw before, nor ever deſire

                  <speaker>SNEER.</speaker>
                  <p>I am quite of your opinion, Mrs. Dangle;
the theatre, in proper hands, might certainly
be made the ſchool of morality; but now, I am
ſorry to ſay it, people ſeem to go there princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
for their entertainment!</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. DANGLE.</speaker>
                  <p>It would have been more to the credit of the

                  <speaker>SNEER.</speaker>
                  <p>Undoubtedly, Madam, and hereafter perhaps
to have had it recorded, that in the midſt of a
luxurious and diſſipated age, they preſerv'd <hi>two</hi>
houſes in the capital, where the converſation
was always moral at leaſt, if not entertaining!</p>

                  <speaker>DANGLE.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, egad, I think the worſt alteration is in
the nicety of the audience.—No double enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,
no ſmart inuendo admitted; even Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh
and Congreve oblig'd to undergo a

                  <p>Yes, and our prudery in this reſpect is juſt on

                  <p>O, that's a comedy, on a very new plan;
replete with wit and mirth, yet of a moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
moral! You ſee it is call'd "THE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORMED
HOUSEBREAKER;" where, by the mere
force of humour, HOUSEBREAKING is put into ſo
ridiculous a light, that if the piece has its proper
run, I have no doubt but that bolts and bars will
be entirely uſeleſs by the end of the ſeaſon.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir FRETFUL.</speaker>
                  <p>The NEWS-PAPERS!—Sir, they are the moſt

                  <speaker>Sir FRETFUL.</speaker>

Dangle; how often muſt I repeat it to you,
that nothing can vex me but your ſuppoſing it
poſſible for me to mind the damn'd nonſenſe
you have been repeating to me!—and let me tell
you, if you continue to believe this, you muſt
mean to inſult me, gentlemen—and then your
diſreſpect will affect me no more than the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper
criticiſms—and I ſhall treat it—with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly

I ſay, tho' the rogues have lately got ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
for their language—not an article of the
merit their's!—take them out of their Pulpits,
and they are as dull as Catalogues.—No, Sir;—'twas
I firſt enrich'd their ſtyle—'twas I firſt
taught them to crowd their advertiſements with
panegyrical ſuperlatives, each epithet riſing
above the other—like the Bidders in their own
Auction-rooms! From ME they learn'd to enlay
their phraſeology with variegated chips of exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
metaphor: by ME too their inventive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0778900300:41"/>
were called forth.—Yes Sir, by ME they
were inſtructed to clothe ideal walls with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
fruits—to inſinuate obſequious rivulets
into viſionary groves—to teach courteous ſhrubs
to nod their approbation of the grateful ſoil!
or on emergencies to raiſe upſtart oaks, where
there never had been an acorn; to create a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
vicinage without the aſſiſtance of a
neighbour; or fix the temple of Hygeia in the

the day before it is to be performed, I write
an account of the manner in which it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived—I
have the plot from the author,—and
only add—Characters ſtrongly drawn—highly
coloured—hand of a maſter—fund of genuine
humour—mine of invention—neat dialogue—attic
ſalt! Then for the performance—Mr.
DODD was aſtoniſhingly great in the character
of SIR HARRY! That univerſal and judicious
actor Mr. PALMER, perhaps never appeared to
more advantage than in the COLONEL;—but it
is not in the power of language to do juſtice to
Mr. KING!—Indeed he more than merited thoſe
repeated burſts of applauſe which he drew from
a moſt brilliant and judicious audience! As to
the ſcenery—The miraculous power of Mr. DE
LOUTHER BOURG's pencil are univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged!—In
ſhort, we are at a loſs which to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
moſt,—the unrivalled genius of the author,
the great attention and liberality of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers—the
wonderful abilities of the painter,
or the incredible exertions of all the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers!—</p>

                  <p>O that, Sir, does well in the form of
a <hi>Caution.</hi>—In a matter of gallantry now—Sir
FLIMSY GOSSIMER, wiſhes to be well with
LADY FANNY FETE—He applies to me—I
open trenches for him with a paragraph
in the Morning Poſt.—It is recommended
to the beautiful and accompliſhed Lady F
four ſtars F daſh E to be on her guard
againſt that dangerous character, Sir F daſh G;
who, however pleaſing and inſinuating his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may be, is certainly not remarkable for the
<hi>conſtancy of his attachments!</hi>—in Italics.—Here
you ſee, Sir FLIMSY GOSSIMER is introduced to
the particular notice of Lady FANNY—who,
perhaps never thought of him before—ſhe finds
herſelf publickly cautioned to avoid him, which
naturally makes her deſirous of ſeeing him;—the
obſervation of their acquaintance cauſes a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0778900300:48"/>
pretty kind of mutual embarraſſment, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a ſort of ſympathy of intereſt—which, if
Sir Flimſy is unable to improve effectually, he
at leaſt gains the credit of having their names
mentioned together, by a particular ſet, and in a
particular way,—which nine times out of ten is
the full accompliſhment of modern gallantry!</p>

                  <p>Now, Sir, the PUFF COLLATERAL is much
uſed as an appendage to advertiſements, and
may take the form of anecdote.—Yeſterday
as the celebrated GEORGE BON-MOT was ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
down St. James's-ſtreet, he met the lively
Lady MARY MYRTLE, coming out of the
Park,—'Good God, LADY MARY, I'm ſurpriſed
to meet you in a white jacket,—for I expected
never to have ſeen you, but in a full-trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
unifor, and a light-horſeman's cap!'—"Heavens,
GEORGE, where could you have
learned that?"—'Why, replied the wit, I juſt
ſaw a print of you, in a new publication called
The CAMP MAGAZINE, which, by the bye, is
a deviliſh clever thing,—and is ſold at No. 3, on
the right hand of the way, two doors from the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0778900300:49"/>
printing-office, the corner of Ivy-lane, Pater-noſter-row,
price only one ſhilling!'</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SNEER.</speaker>
                  <p>Very ingenious indeed!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>PUFF.</speaker>
                  <p>But the PUFF COLLUSIVE is the neweſt of
any; for it acts in the diſguiſe of determined
hoſtility.—It is much uſed by bold bookſellers
and enterpriſing poets.—An indignant correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
obſerves—that the new poem called
BEELZEBUB's COTILLION, or PROSERPINE's
FETE CHAMPETRE, is one of the moſt unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
performances he ever read! The ſeverity
with which certain characters are handled is quite
ſhocking! And as there are many deſcriptions
in it too warmly coloured for female delicacy,
the ſhameful avidity with which this piece is
bought by all people of faſhion, is a reproach
on the taſte of the times, and a diſgrace to the
delicacy of the age!—Here you ſee the
two ſtrongeſt inducements are held forth;—Firſt,
that nobody ought to read it;—and ſecondly,
that every body buys it; on the ſtrength of
which, the publiſher boldly prints the tenth edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
before the had ſold ten of the firſt; and
then eſtabliſhes it by threatening himſelf with
the pillory, or abſolutely indicting himſeif for
SCAN. MAG.!</p>

                  <p>As to the PUFF OBLIQUE, or PUFF BY IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLICATION,
it is too various and extenſive to
be illuſtrated by an inſtance;—it attracts in
titles, and preſumes in patents; it lurks in the
<hi>limitation</hi> of a ſubſcription, and invites in the
aſſurance of croud and incommodation at
public places; it delights to draw forth conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
merit, with a moſt diſintereſted aſſiduity; and
ſometimes wears a countenance of ſmiling cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and tender reproach.—It has a wonderful
memory for Parliamentary Debates, and will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
give the whole ſpeech of a favoured mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
with the moſt flattering accuracy. But,
above all, it is a great dealer in reports and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.—It
has the earlieſt intelligence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
preferments that will reflect <hi>honor</hi> on the
<hi>patrons;</hi> and embryo promotions of modeſt
gentlemen—who know nothing of the matter
themſelves. It can hint a ribband for implied
ſervices, in the air of a common report; and
with the careleſneſs of a caſual paragraph, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
officers into commands—to which they have
no pretenſion but their wiſhes. This, Sir,
is the laſt principal claſs in the ART of
PUFFING—An art which I hope you will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0778900300:51"/>
now agree with me, is of the higheſt dignity—yielding
a tablature of benevolence and public
ſpirit; befriending equally trade, gallantry, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,
and politics:—the applauſe of genius! the
regiſter of charity! the triumph of heroiſm!
the ſelf defence of contractors! the fame of
orators!—and the gazette of miniſters!</p>
