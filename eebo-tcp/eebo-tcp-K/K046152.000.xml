            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may be depended upon, that the following piece appeals more to Facts than Fancy; however ſtrong the Colouring may appear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attach'd judgement will pronounce it not exaggerated; the Author has particularly dwelt on ſordid Management, as that is the polluted ſource of all Theatrical dullneſs and deficiency: Mr GARRICK is exceedingly blameable, and, therefore, particularly noticed. About the time he got a ſhare in Drury-Lane Patent, our preſent Laureat wrote him a letter,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> 2d Volume of DODSLEY's Collection of POEMS.</note> in which, among other paſſages, we find Thalia ſpeaking thus:
<q>
                  <l>No more the poor polluted ſcene</l>
                  <l>Shall teem with births of Harlequin;</l>
                  <l>Or vindicated ſtage ſhall feel</l>
                  <l>The inſults of the dancer's heel;</l>
                  <l>Such idle traſh we'll kindly ſpare</l>
                  <l>To Op'ras now: they'll want them there.</l>
               </q>
Afterwards, addreſſing Mr. Garrick, the poet ſays:
<q>
                  <l>Conſult your own good ſenſe in all,</l>
                  <l>Be deaf to Faſhion's fickle call;</l>
                  <l>Nor e'er deſcend to reaſon's laws</l>
                  <l>To court, what you command, applauſe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How far Roſcius has fulfilled the prophecy, or conſulted his own DISINTERESTED good ſenſe, experience ſadly tells. Some hireling news-paper friends ſay, if the public will follow ſuch traſh, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers are right to furniſh it; but will common ſenſe allow, that thoſe
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0211303000:5"/>
public purveyors ſhould, like common proſtitutes, be allowed to pick young and unwary pockets by falſe glaring colours. Public complaint has been loud; yet the tide of avarice and folly moſt audaciouſly flows on.—The theatres have been likened to taverns, where, if you don't like the proviſion or wines, you may ſtay away, or go to another; true; but there are MANY taverns; only TWO theatres: a <hi>third</hi> of the latter, would make eſſential difference; allow a ſmall anecdote: QUEEN ELIZABETH, having received remarkable inſtances of ardent loyalty from a ſmall country town, ſaid; if they would aſk any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable grant, in her power, they ſhould be indulged. Licence for an alehouſe was the demand. Surpriſed, me aſked the reaſon; becauſe, ſaid they, we have but one, and they give us ſuch wretched traſh we can't drink it; if there was another, emulation would produce us ſomething worth money: the application is obvious.</p>
            <p>One half the money, that either INSTALLATION has coſt, nightly extra expences included, would have genteely paid Mr. MOSSOP, who is intrinſically worth a thouſand ſuch Chriſtmas-Holliday Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
            <p>As to the performers, we know they, like a neſt of diſturbed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, will buzz and whet their ſtings; it will be called cruelty to attack bread; how abſurd an aſſertion: if a ſhoemaker, or taylor, executes, what he is paid for, badly, have not cuſtomers a right to complain? nothing is more true than the following lines of CHUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHILL, with which we ſhall conclude;
<q>
                  <l>The ſtage I chuſe—a ſubject fair and free;</l>
                  <l>'Tis your's—'tis mine—'tis public property:</l>

            <l>When inſignificance ſuch influence gains?</l>
            <l>Judgement, with calmeſt patience join'd, muſt frown,</l>
            <l>When one hand mounts, to let the other down;</l>
            <l>When grief or declamation drooping flags,</l>

            <l>Once, in FOOTE's pieces, GARDNER gave us joy,</l>

            <l>Or ſuch applauſe, in various lights, command:</l>
            <l>Perhaps, not one— then let our cordial lays</l>

            <l>When public favour warmly ſtamps regard,</l>
