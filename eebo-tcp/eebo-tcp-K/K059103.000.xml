            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the Follies and Vices incidental to mankind, none can be deem'd more Contemptively Erroneous, than that of Living beyond our Fortunes, and running into expenſive Dignities, ſuperior to the Sphere of Life, in which Providence has placed us. The World has been, and daily continue to be convinced of the truth of this aſſertion, yet ſo prevalant is this Folly, (I may call it even a Crime,) that either thro' weakneſs of Judgement, or ill placed Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0092100900:3"/>
very near three parts of the World are guilty of it to their own Prejudice, and thoſe whom they are concern'd with.</p>
            <p>The following Sheets, contain a genuine Account of an unhappy inſtance of this kind, and it's fatal conſequences, which give me leave to hope may happily prevent any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ills of this Nature. And tho' Hiſtories are ſo commonly made the Entertainment of the Publick, that Truth and Falſehood are equally regarded, and paſt by, by the Reader only as Fabulous, but this Narrative, has a Claim to Reflection, as it Unfortunately happen'd in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt,, and was the ruin of two worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, whoſe Branches are ſtill in being; one of whom gave me a ſufficient Account as give them by Tradition, and are now notwithſtanding the length of Time ſince the dreadful event, unhappy Sufferers, thro' the Indiſcretion of their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>In the foremention'd Reign there was a Gentleman whoſe name was <hi>Weſton,</hi> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſon of a large Eſtate near the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who had been Father of many Children, but it pleaſed Heaven to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0092100900:4"/>
deprive him of all, except one Daughter his laſt born, on whom he beſtow'd all that a fond Fater could, to make her a perfectly Accompliſh'd young Lady: As ſhe was heireſs to a very conſiderable Eſtate, Mr. <hi>Weſton</hi> was reſolv'd to Qualify her in ſuch a manner, as to double the value of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, by inſtilling into her Mind, ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as would not only ſecure her own Happineſs, but that of the Perſon who ſhould be deſtin'd her Partner for Life.</p>
            <p>Her beauty, Merit and Fortune, from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years of Age, aſſembled a numerous train of Admirers, but as her heart was not affected by any of them 'till ſhe was above ſeventeen, her Father would not inſiſt on a Union with any, 'till ſhe had met with the Man ſhe thought ſhe could be truly happy with; rather preferring his Daughter's Peace of Mind than her intereſt, as he could make a worthy Husband entirely eaſy in point of Circumſtances, whom gratitude as well as Love, wou'd he conceiv'd, compel him to uſe his Child well not only by the Poſſeſſion of a blooming Amiable Creature, but receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Advantage of Fortune, the want of which, has too often made way for a Fool, while a Man of Senſe, has been deprived of

               </gap> of Miſs <hi>Weſton's,</hi> as he had a very great Friendſhip for her Father, he heartily wiſh'd an alliance between the two Families, and as the two Ladies had contracted a very great Eſteem for each other, he thought his Daughter might kindly become her Brother's Advocate, but that was entirely needleſs, for the Moment Miſs <hi>Weſton</hi> and young <hi>Dennis</hi> met they received a Reciprocal Tenderneſs, tho' each was ignorant of the effect of their Interviews at that time; and ſecretly Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd for each other, 'till Miſs <hi>Weſton</hi> in her private Conferrences with Miſs <hi>Dennis,</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently artleſly diſcover'd the paſſion ſhe had for her Brother, who had not fail'd before that time to make an open Declaration to his Siſter of the fond Regard he conceiv'd at firſt ſight
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0092100900:6"/>
for her agreeable Friend: This did not long remain a Secret in the Family, for Miſs <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> immediately inform'd her Pappa, who communicated the Affair to Mr <hi>Weſton,</hi> and in ſhort with all due regard to the modeſt Fears of the Enamour'd young Lady, the old Gentleman contriv'd very ſpeedily to Crown the happy Lover's wiſhes, by a Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of their Nuptials at <hi>Canterbury</hi> Cathedral.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time after, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> Set up his Son in a Silk Mercer's Shop, giving him a Fortune of four thouſand Pounds, in ready Caſh, beſides Two thouſand more in Stock.</p>
            <p>Tho' this was a genteel Fortune, 'twas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the young Lady's; whoſe Father gave her on the Day of Marriage, ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds in Bank Notes, and at his Death left her ten Thouſand more.</p>
            <p>In a few Weeks after the young couple were married, they open'd a very Grand Shop in the City, and Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> placed with his Son as his Foreman one Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> an elderly diſcreet Man, who had ſerv'd in that
<pb facs="tcp:0092100900:7"/>
Capacity with young <hi>Dennis</hi>'s maſter, who having acquired a Competent Fortune, left off Trade and retir'd into the Country.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was a worthy Man, who having a very large Family, and meeting with mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in Trade, was in his early Days ſo ſo unhappily reduc'd, as to be oblig'd to throw up his Buſineſs, that without Scandal or reproach he might do Juſtice to his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, tho' he himſelf ſuffered greatly, from many to whom he had largely intruſted his Goods, for very conſiderable ſums.</p>
            <p>But as he was a Man of almoſt unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented Principles of honour, he rather choſe to lead a life of ſervitude, than meanly buffet with ill fortune, to ſupport at beſt a broken Reputation.</p>
            <p>Young <hi>Dennis</hi> receiv'd his inſtructions in Trade from Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> who tutor'd him in ſo gentle a Manner, it occaſion'd a great Regard and Tenderneſs on both ſides, and gave the good Man ſuch a power over <hi>Dennis</hi> that he ſtrictly adher'd to what he adviſed or propoſed, and thought himſelf under a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0092100900:8"/>
obligation to pay him the Reſpect due to Father, and was as fearful of Offending the Friendſhip of the one as of diſobeying the Commands of the other.</p>
            <p>But Alaſs Time which brings forth all ſtrange and unaccountable things, wrought a fatal change in the diſpoſition of this thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs young man, who inſtead of following the worthy examples of his induſtrious friend, ſoon after his kind father had ſettled him in ſuch a manner, as enabled him in a few years to acquire an immenſe fortune; he grew tired of buſineſs, and too fond of every pleaſurable expence that could poſſibly Conſpire to effect his ruin, and deſtroy his fame; the firſt ſtep towards his deſtruction was to ſet up an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and furniſh both his town and country houſe ſuitable to the dignity of a man of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; as the family increaſed as it did every year by the birth of a child, additional ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were provided, and every needful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was ſwell'd into a ſuperfluity.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt of the follies he run into the encouragement of a ſet of hangers on, who made him their daily bread, was not the leaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0092100900:9"/>
And the only virtue that remained untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, was a tender fondneſs for his wife and children, which indeed each had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted claim to; the former for her uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon merit in regard to her husband, and the World in general, the other from their inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended innocence.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> perceiving his maſter's growing ruin, took upon him to uſe the Priveledge of friendſhip, to warn of the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of perſiſting in a continuation of this courſe of life, but he had the mortification to find him cold and unwilling to hear or regard the tender admonitions he frequently made uſe of.</p>
            <p>At laſt Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> who was ready dreſs'd for a journey to his country houſe one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rang the bell, at which ſummons a youth who was a turn-over Apprentice to him inſtantly appeared and receiv'd an order from his maſter for Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> to ſend him up a bill or caſh, for fifty pounds, inſtead of the money Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> ſent his reſpects, and that he would wait upon him himſelf in a few momets, which accordingly he did, carrying
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0092100900:10"/>
with him his book of accompts, inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the demand made by the apprentice. When Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> enter'd the room, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> perceiv'd the marks of real ſorrow in his countenance, which ſhock'd him, but he ſtill endeavour'd to hide it from the other, and demanded the money, upon which Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> look'd at him very ſtedfaſtly, fetch'd a deep figh, deſir'd him to look over thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts and judge how much reaſon he had to ſuppoſe, that 'twas poſſible for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a draught to be anſwer'd, and after ſhewing him the accounts which he knew he would himſelf inſpect, he ſat down by him, and with an almoſt broken heart, inſiſting on his knowing the ſhameful miſery he had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf too, and thus addreſs'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"'Tis now Sir, the ſeventh year of your marriage, Six of which you have cruelly ſpent in the Perpretation of your ruin; your wife's fortune and your own, with your ſtock in trade incluſive, is laviſhly waſted in Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, far beyond your right to run into had you been poſſeſs'd of double the ſum; and give me leave to add, that the figure you have

            <p>Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> was too ſenſible of the means he had uſed to prove the truth of his friend's aſſertion, and conſervently remained ſilent for ſome time, at laſt conſcious of his error, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0092100900:12"/>
broke through his confuſion, intreating Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> to conceal the dreadful ſituation of his affairs from Mrs <hi>Dennis,</hi> who was entirely innocent and ignorant of them: The fortune (ſaid he) which ſhe brought me obliged me in honour to regard it as a more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent competence to ſupport her without expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her to the care and fatigue of my buſineſs and tho' I have thro' a miſtaken pride, and ridiculous ambition, to ſet myſelf above my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, undone my family, ſhe poor ſoul, never was the leaſt incentive to the ruin in which I have inconſiderately involv'd myſelf: What ſhall I do? the coach now waits at the door to carry her with my Sſter to <hi>Woodford</hi> where we propoſe to remain 'till after Chriſtmas, but the concern I juſtly labour under renders me incapable of purſuing my intent, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any reaſonable excuſe to her for not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> overjoy'd to find he had wrought ſuch an effect on his mind, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to uſe his utmoſt endeavour to ſoften the rigour of his fortune, and find an excuſe to Mrs, <hi>Dennis,</hi> that ſhould appear ſo plauſible ſhe ſhould go to her country houſe without her

            <p>He had ſcarce told his maſter his deſign, than Mrs. <hi>Dennis</hi> enter'd the room, and with her uſual ſweetneſs of temper, fondly ſmiling on her husband, tenderly accuſed him of delay; informing him the coach had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable time and the little Pratlers waited with impatience for Papa to mount and ſet forward to <hi>Woodford.</hi>

            <p>Mr <hi>Arnold</hi> who was ever a ſincere and valuable friend, to prevent his friend's confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, directly told her, he was fearful his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt follow her, for he had receiv'd a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inform him Mr. <hi>Edgeworth</hi> who was a Merchant, and betroth'd to Miſs <hi>Dennis,</hi> was arriv'd from the <hi>Indies,</hi> at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and lay there dangerouſly ill, and intreated Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> to come forthwith, to ſettle ſome affairs between them, in regard to himſelf and his Siſter, but intreated a concealment of the danger he was in to Miſs <hi>Dennis,</hi> (whom he lov'd more than life) till either Death or a Recovery ſhould make it neceſſary for her to know it</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0092100900:14"/>
Mrs. <hi>Dennis,</hi> eaſily credited the report, and teſtified a ſincere concern for the news, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſing to keep the ſecret from her Siſter, and earneſtly injoining her Husband to follow her with the utmoſt Expedition.</p>
            <p>He led her to the Coach, and took leave, when ſhe was gone, Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> aſſured him, 'twas highly proper for him to abſcond, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proving to him, his perſon was in danger if he remain'd at home a day longer: adding that he had from time to time put off his Creditors, partly with diſtributing money, and partly by fair promiſes, but that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were ſo great, the caſh was exhauſted and their patience tired out; therefore Sir, (ſaid he) let me adviſe you, as your horſes are now ready, leave the Servants at home who were ready to attend you, and take Mr. William with you (meaning the Apprentice) you know he is an honeſt youth, and loves you too well to betray any truſt you repoſe in him; and tho' I have endeavour'd to conceal your unhappy miſmanagement from him as much as poſſible, yet his conſtant aſſiduity in his buſineſs, has laid open to him as much as painfully convinces him, that all is not right
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0092100900:15"/>
tho' he modeſtly conceals by even the moſt diſtant hints even to me, that he knows any thing of the matter, but his grateful heart, hourly obliges him to remember your kindly preventing him from being turn'd over to Mr. <hi>Oſwald,</hi> who would have made his life hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, as to his other apprentices; and thinks he can never ſufficiently repay the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation you confer'd on him, by your kind acceptation of him, to ſerve the remaining part of his time with you.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, added Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> wherever you pleaſe to go, or whatever you think proper to tranſact, you may ſafely truſt him with, and i'm certain he will with the utmoſt fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity communicate it to me, who will make it my immediate buſienſs, to ſummon all your Creditors and if poſſible gain time enough by prudent conduct to retrieve all yet.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> thankfully received Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>'s friendly advice, and ſet out with his young apprentice undetermin'd what courſe to ſteer, but in the end, he happen'd to ſtop at a lone genteel Inn, upon <hi>Blackheath,</hi> where after they had refreſh'd themſelves, as it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0092100900:16"/>
near town for-expedition's ſake, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> concluded to make that houſe his repoſitory, till he heard what progreſs Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had made in his affairs in London; accordingly William was diſpatch'd home to inform Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> where his maſter reſided, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for three days before he heard from his faithful friend, who made the beſt uſe of his time, to bring the creditors to a Compoſition but in vain; the extravagant courſe of Life Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> had led, and bearing himſelf with a loſty pride. by ſcarcely bargaining but referring it to Servants, had ſo exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they were reſolved to put the Law in force againſt him to the utmoſt extremity; and accordingly one morning the Shop had not been open above half an hour, before there enter'd an execution againſt Body and Goods.</p>

flagrant piece of advice, ſo called for the Landlord and thanked him for his concern, aſſuring him the Secret ſhould be for ever bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his Boſom, but deſired him never more to urge the Subject, and that he would not be thought guilty of compounding with Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; inſiſted on returning the Notes, which the Landlord begged he would not, but the other inſiſted upon it, upon which the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord as ſtreniouſly inſiſted that he would make his Houſe his own, and as freely Command all that was in it; Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> thankfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that he was obliged to him for his offer, but that he was under no neceſſity at that time to accept on it; while they were converſing poor <hi>William</hi> arrived with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſhocking Account, that the Creditors had ſent their emiſſaries to <hi>Woodford,</hi> and that they had even taken the Watch from Mrs. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s ſide, ſo the ſad Cataſtrophe was no longer a Secret to the whole Family.</p>
            <p>Old Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> was ſo violently exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he refuſed the leaſt Aſſiſtance towards his Son's Redemption, yet pitied his unhappy Daughter in Law, and behaved very tender towards her and her Children as a fond Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

poſſibly could, intreating her to go home with him and ſtrongly urged her though 'twas his own Child to endeavour to forget him; but her fondneſs was too powerful to liſten to his Advice, which in the mood the old Gentleman was in, he order'd his Coach and went away highly diſpleaſed at his Daughter's refuſal of his offer, Mr. <hi>Edgeworth,</hi> who had a ſincere regard for young <hi>Dennis,</hi> which was greatly ſtrengthened by the inviolate fondneſs he had for his Siſter, kindly and generouſly reſolved to repair his Fortune, by bringing his Creditors to a Compoſition, or if that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he reſolved to pay his Debts, and give him a Term of Years to make him an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</p>
            <p>Miſs <hi>Harriet</hi> took this as the higheſt proof of his Regard to her, tho' ſhe was ſorty he ſhould hazard any part of his Fortune to ſerve her Relation, and that ſhe wanted no ſuch ſevere proofs of his Paſſion for her, for ſuch ſhe term'd it, as it was doubtful whether it would ever be in her Brother's power to make him a ſuitable return; but theſe fears did not prevent his generous deſign, which he put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to immediate Execution the moment he got

            <p>As he had attempted his Life, proper care was taken to prevent his deſtroying himſelf, and as ſoon as he was committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> a ſufficient Guard was ſet over him on that Account.</p>

            <p>The Night before his Execution ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in ſtaying in the <hi>Preſs-Yard,</hi> on the outſide of the Cell, where her deſtin'd Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lay; as ſoon as he was brought forth in the Morning in order to receive his Fate, with ſpeechleſs Grief ſhe fell into his Arms, with the tendereſt Marks of deep and ſilent Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;

            <p>This ſhocking ſcene drew Tears from each Spectator, and ſent the Dying Husband quite delirious to his ſhameful End.
