            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I beg your attention for a moment:—Ann Killigrew has been invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably my friend. Long before I was the Infanta's deputy, ſhe was zealous in my ſervice: ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged my propenſity to comedy, flattered my feeble talent, and obtained my admiſſion to the ſtage.</p>

                  <speaker>Nell Gwyn.</speaker>
                  <p>Suppreſs your impatience:—you ſhall know in a moment. My friend has laughed away 45 years, inattentive to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and careleſs of her income, which, like a glittering bubble, glided down the ſtream ſo faſt, till at length if burſt. I propoſe, that, in this ſhipwreck of her fortune, the Oliverian knight ſhall ſave her from ſinking.—Thus I have an opportunity offered me of repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her friendſhip.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Nell Gwyn.</speaker>
                  <p>No chimera, I aſſure you: Sir Oliver will moſt certainly apply to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of my good offices, for the ſucceſs of his memorial: I ſhall freely promiſe him my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and ſhall intimate to him, at the ſame time, that a matrimonial connection with ſome royaliſt would ſmooth every obſtacle to his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; as it would be a proof to the king of the truth of his political converſion.</p>

                  <speaker>Killigrew.</speaker>
                  <p>I allow that the avaricious knight will be governed by his intereſt: but how will you induce the lady to connect herſelf with this formal old batchelor? take my word ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0057900300:7"/>will never reliſh a ſeaſt compoſed of ſuch obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete ingredients.</p>

                  <p>The perſon, my dear Killigrew, who waits for dinner, till it is very late, without having taken any intervening refreſhment, is not exacting or faſtidious concerning the cookery. Direct the application to Ann Killigrew, and you will not, I think, deſpair of my obtaining her conſent. I hear a carriage; it is moſt likely the knight with his formality and his memorial. I beg you will receive him, and inform him of my royal injunction, to ſtay here till the arrival of his majeſty.

                  <p>I am in doubt whether or no, I ſhall be vain of that compliment; for ſince, Sir Oliver, you denominate us courtiers ſtars, it ſeems as if you thought our whole crowded conſtellation made at moſt a brilliant night, ſince the ſun of the common-wealth is gone down.</p>

                  <p>Suppoſe, Sedley, we give our pupil a curſory knowledge of the current expreſſions in our ſociety, which are ſtamped with our peculiar meaning. For example, Sir Oliver, when we ſpeak of a Lady's monſter, we always mean the Lady's huſband.</p>

                  <p>You will frequently hear us ſay, ſuch a Lady has a ſhort memory; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this has nothing to do with the retentive faculty in general, it only ſignifies that the Lady is inadvertent to one ſmall unimportant article of the matrimonial ſtate—that is to ſay, the vow of fidelity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Oliver.</speaker>
                  <p>I am apt to believe the Ladies at Whitehall are not peculiarly gifted with memory.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Killigrew.</speaker>
                  <p>Bravo, Sir Oliver, you are an apt ſcholar.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Charles Sedley.</speaker>
                  <p>If you ſhould hear us, by chance, call a man an unicorn; the meaning we apply to that term is, that the Gentleman is poſſeſſed of a wife, who has only once deviated from the conjugal path, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not entitled to the full honours of the fraternity.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Killigrew.</speaker>
                  <p>I think it is quite ſuperfluous to load Sir Oliver's memory with that term;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0057900300:15"/>for I ſmcerely believe, that, among the whole herd of courtiers, there is not one ſingle unicorn.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Charles.</speaker>
                  <p>We have other expreſſions which we admit; though, like bad coin, they ſcarce amount to half the value they pretend to.—When any perſon among us ſays, 'I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you' ſuch a thing; we interpret that expreſſon into a conditional value: that is to ſay, the perſon intends to keep his promiſe, unleſs ſome intervening objection ſhould ariſe.—Is it not ſo, Killigrew?</p>

                  <p>Again: Suppoſe a man bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows money of you, and he ſolemnly declares that he will repay it <hi>upon his honour</hi>: we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that affirmative negatively.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Oliver.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Sir Oliver.</speaker>
                  <p>What young lady of the Court would ſtoop to a knight of the late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, whoſe age is fifty-eight?</p>

                  <speaker>Nell Gwyn.</speaker>
                  <p>There are ladies who have paſſed their meridian, and whoſe years amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number (I'll ſuppoſe) of forty-two, would eaſily aſſimilate with the number fifty-eight. The two ſeparate numbers, thus coupled, would ſummed up make exactly 4258, which union carries with it a good omen; for it is the number that came up the firſt prize in the laſt year's lottery.</p>

                  <p>I never was more in earneſt in my life: I have a lady in view, who would ſuit you in every reſpect: She is about the age I mentioned; diſplaying a rich ſhew of autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal beauty; attended by all the charms that affability, courteouſneſs, ſprightlineſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, can beſtow.</p>

                  <p>The laſt article of the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is as much her property as her other good qualities: and, it is an additional merit to have lived ſo many years in the warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of Whitehall, without ſingeing the ermine of her innocence. Lord Rocheſter frequently compares her to an iſicle hanging over the mouth of a volcano:—and take notice, Sir Oliver, that Rocheſter is of great authority on a ſubject of this nature.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Oliver.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Sir Oliver.</speaker>
                  <p>If it was the firſt day of April, I ſhould be apt to think, Madam, that you intended to—You underſtand what I mean.</p>

                  <speaker>Nell Gwyn.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed Sir Oliver, if I had a mind to be ſevere, I might ſay that the firſt of April need not take the trouble of coming for the purpoſe you allude to, as it would find the work already done: but I once more aſſure you, that I never was more reſolutely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0057900300:20"/>in earneſt. The marrying a lady for whom the King entertains the higheſt regard, will be the means, the only means, of promoting the ſucceſs of your memorial. The coming into a matrimonial contact with a Lady of the Court, will be a paſſport to the royal favour—it will, like the waters of Lethe, waſh out of remembrance your original ſpot of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm.</p>

                  <p>I am happy to obſserve this youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impatience in you—nevertheleſs, you ſhall not know who your bride is, till you are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to her; which will be in the courſe of a few hours.</p>

                  <p>You ſhall have reaſon to boaſt the power of your attraction.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0057900300:21"/>frolickſome manner of talking; no reproach, no retroſpective cenſure was intended. Look upon me as your friend—Adieu. I adviſe you, Sir Oliver, to go into the garden, and meditate among the flowers: the perſume of the aromatic tribe ſoſtens the heart and diſpoſes it to love; it ſtimulates the imagination and tinges it with all the bright diverſity of colouring—To the following lines Sir John Davies attempered his lyre, in the days of the Virgin Queen.</p>

                  <speaker>Ann Killigrew.</speaker>
                  <p>As for Buckingham, he was very aſſiduous, and extremely in earneſt: he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0057900300:25"/>called upon me one day, when he was a candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for my favour, at a time when, in the heat of his canvaſs, he preſumed of his election. He found me reading the poem of Abſalom and Achitophel (then recently publiſhed), in which you know Buckingham is excellently pourtrayed under the denomination of Zimri. I aſked his Grace in what character he paid me the honour of a viſit—whether as a lover, a painter, a chymiſt, a fidler, or a buffoon?—This, I ſuppoſe, enraged him; for he abruptly withdrew, and never returned.—So much for Buckingham—</p>
                  <p>St. Evremond was alſo very preſſing to obtain my favour. He brought with him that refined civiliſation, that elegance of manners, that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful converſe, that enamelled wit, ſo character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of his countrymen. He talked a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical jargon, which I did not comprehend, though it pleaſed me. He laughed at the folly of the reſtrictive virtues, and ſent them all to Milton's paradiſe of fools. But his uglineſs unfaſcinated the powers of his eloquence: my Guardian Angel ſat aſtride on the large wen on his forehead, and ſaved me from ruin—ſo much for St. Evremond.</p>

                  <speaker>Ann Killigrew.</speaker>
                  <p>Old Waller uſed alſo to ſhoot at me, but his bullets being nothing more than poetical ſugar-plumbs, no miſchief enſued. But the moſt formidable battle that ever I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, was againſt Rocheſter: It was ſome years ago, when he acted the part of a German conjuror in the city: the celebrity of 'the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fortune-teller excited my curioſity, for I had not the ſmalleſt intimation who it was—But I tire you perhaps.</p>

                  <speaker>Ann Killigrew.</speaker>
                  <p>I dreſſed myſelf in the moſt ſimple manner, in the <hi>coſtume</hi> of a village girl: and ſtole away (at night) into the city, in a hackney coach. As ſoon as I was introduced to the venerable necromancer, he accoſted me in theſe words:—"My beautiful little ruſtic, you will moſt certainly be wedded to the youth you love."—To which gracious prophecy I returned a very humble, aukward, and cottage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like curteſey. He added—"I perceive however, my dear girl, that the ſtars will not conſent to the marriage you have ſo much at heart, till
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0057900300:27"/>you have made ſome other perſon happy firſt; and the ſooner you make ſome perſon happy, the ſooner you will poſſeſs the youth of your affection." He next put a Portugal piece into my hand, then locked the door, threw away his necromantic garment, tore off his whiſkers, diſmiſſed his hoary locks, and ſuddenly the German Doctor was transformed into the gay, the daring, the amorous Rocheſter.</p>

My three maiden aunts, where were they?—the three ſcare-crow guardians of the Heſperian fruit! They were caterwauling round ſome card table. Where was my poor grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother?

                  <p>Secure in the circle of ſix watchmen, who broke open the door, attended by conſtables who came with a warrant to ſeize the German Doctor, under the notion of his being a ſpy. I applied to the reverend watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for protection, and they conducted me
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0057900300:28"/>through Maiden-Alley, to a coach.—So much for Rocheſter.</p>

The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful hours that draw the car in Guido's famous picture, were not to be compared to the <hi>days</hi> of Rocheſter. They were, however, not halcyon days. Sunday, Monday, Tueſday, and Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday were tempeſtuous: Thurſday was a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, ungenial day: Friday was ſullen, and cloudy: and Saturday thundered like a ſcold.</p>

A young man, who by his emotion appeared to know me, begged he might intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to the reſpectable Lady of the manſion—a widow, whoſe name was Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and who was impatient, he ſaid, of the honour of receiving me beneath her roof. He then led me into an antique hall, where ſat, in an oaken richly carved chair, the aged Lady. A pleaſurable air of affability illumed her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; ſtill did her faded check diſplay a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering grace! a winter flower! Then ſlowly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0057900300:51"/>riſing from her ſeat, the venerable form advanced, and thus ſhe accoſted me:—"Three ſons! my valiant ſons! were ſlain in battle, fighting in your father's cauſe! and at their ſide my little grandſon, ſcarce fourteen, my lovely, my endearing Henry, fell!—Since that ſad day oppreſſed with the weight of mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affliction, I have daily implored the great diſpenſer of events to remove me from this ſcene of miſery: but at this moment, I thank my God, that he decrees I ſtill ſhould linger on this ſide the grave, for the purpoſe of adminiſtering ſome little comfort to your unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſituation! The tear that now weeps down my cheek is not the effuſion of parental ſorrow, it is the guſh of wounded affection for my afflicted Sovereign!" She then attempted to ſalute my hand, which I declined; and, yielding to the warm impulſe of nature, with a grateful heart I threw my arms around her neck, and wept.—I now pour a libation to the vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dame.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hume.</note>

                  <p>By no means, I am in this inſtance only, Sir Oliver's taſter! Before we part, I will repeat to the bridegroom four lines, written ſome time ago by Sir Charles Sedley, addreſſed to the bride:—</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Were I Apollo? no! I would not chuſe</l>
                     <l>The gay Ann Kill'grew for my darling muſe;</l>
                     <l>Let other nymphs the learned mount aſcend;</l>
                     <l>She ſhould be Thetis!—and the day ſhould end.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Now I imagine, Sir Oliver, that you are Apollo: here is Thetis, and the day is ended.—Adieu.</p>
