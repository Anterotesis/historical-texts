            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Gentleman well known to the political world in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the preſent century made the tour of <hi>Europe,</hi> and before he reached <hi>Abbeville</hi> diſcovered that in order to ſee a country to beſt advantage it was infinitely preferable to travel by day than by night.</p>
            <p>I cannot help making this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to myſelf, who, after publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three volumes of the <hi>Zoology</hi> of GREAT BRITAIN, found out that to
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0301300200:3"/>
be able to ſpeak with more preciſion of the ſubjects I treated of, it was far more prudent to viſit the whole than part of my country: ſtruck therefore with the reflection of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſeen SCOTLAND, I inſtantly ordered my baggage to be got ready, and in a reaſonable time found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the banks of the <hi>Tweed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as I communicated to you my reſolution, with your accuſtomed friendſhip you wiſhed to hear from me: I could give but a partial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my promiſe, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a traveller being ſo much taken up as to leave very little room for the diſcharge of epiſtolary duties; and I flatter myſelf you will find this tardy execution of my engagement more ſatisfactory than the haſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I could ſend you on my road: but this is far from being the ſole motive of this addreſs.</p>
            <p>

I have irreſiſtable inducements of public and of a private nature: to you I owe a moſt free enjoyment of the little territories Providence had beſtowed on me; for by a liberal and equal ceſſion of fields, and meads and woods, you connected all the divided parts, and gave a full ſcope to all my improvements. Every view I take from my window reminds me of my debt, and forbids my ſilence, cauſing the pleaſing glow of gratitude to diffuſe itſelf over the whole frame, inſtead of forcing up the imbittering ſigh of <hi>Oh! ſi angulus ille!</hi> Now every ſcene I enjoy receives new charms, for I mingle with the viſible beauties, the more pleaſing idea of owing them to you, the worthy neighbor and firm friend, who are happy in the calm and domeſtic paths of life with abilities ſuperior to oftentation, and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0301300200:5"/>
goodneſs content with its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: with a ſound judgement and honeſt heart you worthily diſcharge the ſenatorial truſt repoſed in you, whoſe unprejudiced vote aids to ſtill the madneſs of the People, or aims to check the preſumption of the Miniſter. My happineſs in being from your earlieſt life your neighbor, makes me confident in my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; your increaſing and diſcerning band of friends diſcovers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the juſtice of it: may the reaſons that attract and bind us to you ever remain, is the moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiſh that can be thought of, by</p>

            <head>A TOUR IN SCOTLAND. MDCCLXIX.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th of JUNE take my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from CHESTER,<note place="margin">CHESTER.</note> a city without parallel for the ſingular ſtructure of the four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, ſtreets, which are as if excavated out of the earth, and ſunk many feet beneath the ſurface; the carriages drive far beneath the level of the kitchens, on a line with ranges of ſhops, over which on each ſide of the ſtreets paſſengers walk from end to end, in covered galleries, ſecure from wet or heat. The back courts of all theſe houſes are level with the ground, but to go into any of theſe four ſtreets it is neceſſary to deſcend a flight of ſeveral ſteps.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cathedral</hi> is an antient ſtructure, very ragged on the outſide, from the nature of the red friable ſtone <note n="*" place="bottom">Saxum arenarium friabile rubrum <hi>Da Coſta foſſils.</hi> I. 139.</note> with which it is built: the tabernacle work in the choir is very neat; but the beauty, and elegant ſimplicity of a very antique gothic chapter-houſe, is what merits a viſit from every traveller.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hypocauſt</hi> near the <hi>Feathers</hi> Inn, is one of the remains of the <hi>Romans</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">This city was the <hi>Deva</hi> and <hi>Devana</hi> of <hi>Antonine,</hi> and the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Legia viceſſima victrix.</hi>
               </note>, it being well known that this place was a principal ſtation. Among
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0301300200:9"/>
many antiquities found here, none is more ſingular than the rude ſculpture of the <hi>Dea Armigera Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> with her bird and her altar on the face of a rock in a ſmall field near the <hi>Welch</hi> end of the bridge.</p>
            <p>The caſtle is a decaying pile. The walk of the city, the only complete ſpecimens of antient for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, are kept in excellent order, being the principal walk of the inhabitants; the views from the ſeveral parts are very fine; the mountains of <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> the hills of <hi>Broxton,</hi> and the inſulated rock of <hi>Beeſton,</hi> form the ruder part of the ſcenery; a rich flat forms the ſofter view, and the proſpect up the river towards <hi>Boughton,</hi> recalls in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the idea of the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Richmond</hi> hill.</p>
            <p>Paſſed thro' <hi>Tarvin,</hi> a ſmall village; in the church-yard is an epitaph in memory of Mr. <hi>John Thomaſen,</hi> an excellent penman, but particularly famous for his exact and elegant imitation of the <hi>Greek</hi> character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delamere,</hi> which <hi>Leland</hi> calls a faire and large foreſt, with plenty of redde deer and falow, is now a black and dreary waſte; it feeds a few rabbets, and a few black <hi>Terns</hi>

                  </gap>s.</note> a ſmall town, long famous for its rock ſalt, and brine pits; ſome years ago I viſited one of the mines; the ſtratum of ſalt lies about forty yards thick; that which I ſaw was hollowed into the form of a temple; I deſcended thro' a dome, and found the roof ſupported by rows of pillars, about two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0301300200:10"/>
yards thick, and ſeveral in height; the whole was illuminated with numbers of candles, and made a moſt magnificent and glittering appearance. Above the ſalt is a bed of whitiſh clay<note n="*" place="bottom">Argilla caerula-cinerea <hi>Da Coſta foſſils.</hi> I. 48.</note>, uſed in making the <hi>Liverpool</hi> earthen-ware; and in the ſame place is alſo dug a good deal of the <hi>Gypſum,</hi> or plaiſter ſtone. The foſſil ſalt is generally yellow, and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellucid, ſometimes debaſed with a dull greeniſh earth, and is often found, but in ſmall quantities, quite clear and color-leſs.</p>
            <p>The road from this place to <hi>Macclesfield</hi> is thro' a flat, rich, but unpleaſant country. That town is in a very flouriſhing ſtate, is poſſeſſed of a great manufacture of mohair and twiſt buttons; has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween twenty and thirty ſilk mills, and a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable copper ſmelting houſe, and braſs work.</p>
            <p>After leaving this place the country almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly changes and becomes very mountanous and barren, at left on the ſurface; but the bowels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the external ſterility, by yielding ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of coal for the uſe of the neighboring parts of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and for the burning of lime; vaſt quantity is made near <hi>Buxton,</hi> and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to all parts for the purpoſes of agriculture, is become a conſiderable article of commerce.</p>
            <p>The celebrated warm bath of BUXTON <note n="**" place="bottom">The <hi>Romans,</hi> who were remarkably fond of warm baths, did not over-look theſe agreeable waters; they had a bath, incloſed with a brick wall, adjacent to the preſent St. <hi>Anne</hi>'s well, which Dr. <hi>Short</hi> in his eſſay on mineral waters, ſays was razed in 1709.</note> is ſeated in a bottom,<note place="margin">BUXTON.</note> amidſt theſe hills, in a moſt chearleſs ſpot, and would be little frequented, did not <hi>Hygeia</hi> often reſide here, and diſpenſe to her
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0301300200:11"/>
votaries the chief bleſſings of life, eaſe and health with joy and gratitude I this moment reflect on the efficacious qualities of the waters; I recollect with rapture the return of ſpirits, the flight of pain, and re-animation of my long, long crippled rheumatic limbs. But how unfortunate is it, that what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence deſigned for the general good, ſhould be rendered only a partial one, and denied to all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the opulent or I may ſay to the (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) few that can get admittance into the houſe where theſe waters are impriſoned. There are other ſprings (<hi>Cambden</hi> ſays nine) very near that in the <hi>Hall,</hi> and in all probability of equal virtue. I was informed that the late Duke of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> not long before his death, had ordered ſome of theſe to be incloſed and formed into baths. It is to be hoped that his ſucceſſor will not fail adopting ſo uſefull and humane a plan; that he will form it on the moſt enlarged ſyſtem, that they may open not ſolely to theſe whom miſuſed wealth hath rendered invalids, but to the poor cripple, whom honeſt labor hath made a burden to himſelf and his country; and to the ſoldier and ſailor, who by hard ſervice have loſt the uſe ot thoſe very limbs which once were active in our defence. The honor reſulting from ſuch a foundation would be as great, as the ſatisfaction ariſing from a conſciouſneſs of ſo benevolent a work would be unſpeakable; the charms of diſſipation would then loſe their force, and dull and taſteleſs would every human luxury appear to him who had it in his power thus to lay open theſe fountains of health, and to be able to exult in ſuch pathetic and comfortable ſtrains as theſe: <hi>When the ear heard me,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0301300200:12"/>
               <hi>then it bleſſed me, and when the eye ſaw me it gave witneſs to me;</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe I delivered the poor that cried, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and him that had none to help him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, and I cauſed the widow's heart to ſing for joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After leaving <hi>Buxton,</hi> paſſed thro' <hi>Middleton</hi> dale, a deep narrow chaſm between two vaſt cliffs, which extend on each ſide near a mile in length: this road is very ſingular, but the rocks in general are too naked to be beautifull. At the end is the ſmall village of <hi>Stoney Middleton;</hi> here the proſpect opens, and at <hi>Barſly Bridge</hi> exhibits a pretty view of a ſmall but fertile vale, watered by the <hi>Derwent,</hi> and terminated by <hi>Chatſworth,</hi> and its plantations. Arrived and lay at</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cheſterfield;</hi> an ugly town. There is here a great manufacture of worſted ſtockings, and another of a brown earthen-ware, much of which is ſent into <hi>Holland;</hi> the clay is found near the town, over the baſs or cherry<note n="*" place="bottom">Or flinty.</note> ſtratum, above, the coal. The ſteeple of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> church is a ſpire, covered with lead, but by a violent wind ſtrangely bent, in which ſtate it remains.</p>
            <p>In the road ſide, about three miles from the town,<note place="margin">JUNE 27.</note> are ſeveral pits of iron ſtone, about nine or ten feet deep. The ſtratum lies above the coal, and is two feet thick. I was informed that the adventurers pay ten pounds per annum to the Lord of the Soil, for liberty of raiſing it; that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0301300200:13"/>
borers have ſix ſhillings per load for getting it; each load is about twenty ſtrikes or buſhels, which yields a tun of metal. Coal, in theſe parts, is very cheap, a tun and a half being ſold for five ſhillings.</p>
            <p>Changed horſes at <hi>Workſop</hi> and <hi>Tuxford;</hi> croſſed the <hi>Trent</hi> at <hi>Dunham-Ferry,</hi> where it is broad but ſhallow; the ſpring tides flow here, and riſe about two feet, but the common tides never reach this place.

In former times, the perſons who had landed property on either ſide were obliged to ſcower it whenever it was choaked up, and accordingly we find preſentments were made by juries in ſeveral ſucceeding reigns for that purpoſe. Reach</p>
            <p>LINCON, an antient but ill-built city, much fallen away from its former extent. It lies partly on a plain, partly on a very ſteep hill, on whoſe ſummit are the cathedral and the ruins of the caſtle. The firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0301300200:14"/>
is a vaſt pile of gothic architecture; has nothing remarkable on the outſide, but within is of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs beauty and magnificence: the ornaments are exceſſively rich, and in the fineſt gothic taſte; the pillars light, the centre loſty, and of a ſurpriſing grandeur. The windows at the N. and S. ends very antient, but very elegant; one repreſents a leaf with its fibres, the other conſiſts of a number of ſmall circles. There are two other antient win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows on each ſide the great iſle: the others, as I recollect, are modern. This church was, till of late years, much out of repair, but has juſt been reſtored in a manner that does credit to the Chapter. There is indeed a ſort of arch near the W. end, that ſeems placed there (for the ſame end as <hi>Bayes</hi> tells us he wrote one of his ſcenes) meerly to ſet off the reſt.</p>
            <p>The proſpect from this eminence is very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but very barren of objects, a vaſt flat as far as the eye can reach, conſiſting of plains not the moſt fertile, or of fens <note n="*" place="bottom">The fens, naked as they now appear, were once well wooded; oaks have been found buried in them, which were ſixteen yards long, and five in circumference; fir trees from thirty to thirty-five yards long, and a foot or eighteen inches ſquare. Theſe trees had not the mark of the ax, but appeared as if burnt down by fire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to their lower parts. Acorns and ſmall nuts have alſo been found in great quantities in the ſame places. <hi>Dugdale</hi> on embank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 141.</note> and moors: the laſt are far leſs extenſive than they were, many being drained, and will ſoon become the beſt land in the country. But ſtill much remains to be done; the fens near <hi>Reveſby-Abby,</hi> eight miles beyond <hi>Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> are of vaſt extent; but ſerve for little other purpoſe than the rearing great numbers of geeſe, which are the wealth of the fenmen.</p>

During the breeding ſeaſon,<note place="margin">Geeſe.</note> theſe birds are lodged in the ſame houſes with the inhabitants, and even in their very bed-chambers: in every appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are three rows of coarſe wicker pens placed one above another; each bird has its ſeparate lodge divided from the other, which it keeps poſſeſſion of during the time of ſitting. A perſon, called a <hi>Gozzard</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">i. e. Gooſe-herd.</note>, attends the flock, and twice a day drives the whole to water; then brings them back to their habitations, helping thoſe that live in the upper ſtories to their neſts, without ever miſplacing a ſingle bird.</p>
            <p>The geeſe are plucked five times in the year; the firſt plucking is at <hi>Lady-Day,</hi> for feathers and quils, and the ſame is renewed, for feathers only, four times more between that and <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> The old geeſe ſubmit quietly to the operation, but the young ones are very noiſy and unruly. I once ſaw this performed, and obſerved that goſlins of ſix weeks old were not ſpared; for their tails were plucked, as I was told, to habituate them early to what they were to come to.

Theſe the inhabitants navigate in moſt diminutive ſhallow boats; they are, in fact, the roads of the country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eaſt Fen</hi> is quite in a ſtate of nature, and gives a ſpecimen of the country before the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of drainage: it is a vaſt tract of moraſs, intermixed with numbers of lakes, from half a mile to two or three miles in circuit, communicating with each other by narrow reedy ſtraits: they are very ſhallow, none are above four or five feet in depth; but abound with fiſh, ſuch as Pike, Pearch, Ruff, Bream, Tench, Rud, Dace, Roach, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, Sticklebacks and Eels. The fen is covered with reeds, the harveſt of the neighboring inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who mow them annually; for they prove a much better thatch than ſtraw, and not only cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages but many very good houſes are covered with them. Stares, which during winter reſort in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads to rooſt in the reeds, are very deſtructive, by breaking them down by the vaſt numbers that perch on them. The people are therefore very diligent in their attempts to drive them away, and are at great expence in powder to free themſelves from theſe troubleſome gueſts. I have ſeen a ſtock of reeds harveſted and ſtacked worth two or three
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0301300200:17"/>
hundred pounds, which was the property of a ſingle farmer.</p>

The ſhort-eared owl, <hi>Br.

This owl is not obſerved in this county to perch on trees, but conceals itſelf in long old graſs; if diſturbed, takes a ſhort flight, lights again and keeps ſtaring about, during which time its horns are very viſible. The farmers are fond of the arrival of theſe birds, as they clear the fields of mice, and will even fly in ſearch of prey during day, provided the weather is cloudy and miſty.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt curioſity in theſe parts is the vaſt Herony at <hi>Creſſi-Hall,</hi>

I here had opportunity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting my own miſtake, and that of other Ornitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, in making two ſpecies of Herons; for I found that the creſted Heron was only the male of the other: it made a moſt beautifull appearance with its ſnowy neck and long creſt ſtreaming with the wind.

The churches in general, throughout this low tract, are very handſome; all are built of ſtone, which muſt have been brought from places very remote along temporary canals; for, in many inſtances, the quarries lie at leſt twenty miles diſtant. But theſe aedifices were built in zealous ages, when the benedictions or maledictions of the church made the people conquer every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that might obſtruct theſe pious foundations. The abby of <hi>Crowland,</hi> ſeated in the midſt of a ſnaking fen, is a curious monument of the inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable zeal of the times it was erected in; as the beautifull tower of <hi>Boſton</hi> church, viſible from all parts, is a magnificent ſpecimen of a fine gothic taſte.</p>

Returned thro' <hi>Lincoln,</hi> went out of town under the <hi>Newport-Gate,</hi> a curious <hi>Roman</hi> work; paſſed over part of the heath, changed horſes at <hi>Spittle,</hi> and at <hi>Glanford-Bridge,</hi> dined at the ferry-houſe on the banks of the <hi>Humber,</hi> and after a paſſage of about five miles, with a briſk gale, landed at <hi>Hull,</hi> and reached that night <hi>Burton-Conſtable,</hi> the ſeat of Mr. <hi>Conſtable,</hi> in that part of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> called <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;</hi> a dull, flat country, but excellent for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing large cattle, and a good breed of horſes, whoſe prices are near doubled ſince the <hi>French</hi> have grown ſo fond of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> kind.</p>
            <p>Made an excurſion to <hi>Hornſea,</hi> a ſmall town on the coaſt, remarkable only for its mere, a piece of water about two miles long, and one broad, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for its pike and eels; it is divided from the ſea by a very narrow bank, ſo is in much danger of being ſometime or other loſt.</p>
            <p>The cliffs on the coaſt of <hi>Holderneſs</hi> are high, and compoſed of clay, which falls down in vaſt fragments.

            <p>After riding about twenty-two miles thro' a flat grazing country,<note place="margin">JULY 2.</note> reached <hi>Burlington-Quay,</hi> a ſmall town cloſe to the ſea.

            <p>A mile from hence is the town of <hi>Burlington.</hi> The body of the church is large, but the ſteeple, by ſome accident, has been deſtroyed; near it is a large gateway, with a noble gothic arch, poſſibly the remains of a priory of black canons, founded by <hi>Walter de Gant,</hi> in the beginning of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> I.</p>
            <p>This coaſt of the kingdom is very unfavourable to trees, for, except ſome woods in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Burton-Conſtable</hi> there is a vaſt nakedneſs from the <hi>Humber,</hi> as far as the extremity of <hi>Caith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> with a very few exceptions, which ſhall be noted in their proper places.</p>
            <p>Went to <hi>Flamborough</hi>-Head.<note place="margin">JULY 3, <hi>Flamborough-Head.</hi>
               </note> The town is on the North ſide, conſiſts of about one hundred and fifty ſmall houſes, entirely inhabited by fiſhermen, few of whom, as is ſaid, die in their beds, but meet their fate in the element they are ſo conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in. Put myſelf under the direction of <hi>William Camidge,</hi> Ciceroni of the place, who conducted me to a little creek at that time covered with fiſh, a fleet of cobles having juſt put in. Went in one of thoſe little boats to view the <hi>Head,</hi> coaſting it for upwards of two miles. The cliffs are of a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous height, and amazing grandeur; beneath are ſeveral vaſt caverns, ſome cloſed at the end,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0301300200:22"/>
others are pervious, formed with a natural arch, giving a romantic paſſage to the boat, different from that we entered. In ſome places the rocks are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulated, are, of a pyramidal figure, and ſoar up to a vaſt height; the baſes of moſt are ſolid, but in ſome pierced thro', and arched; the color of all theſe rocks is white, from the dung of the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable flocks of migratory birds,<note place="margin">Its birds.</note> which quite cover the face of them, filling every little projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every little hole that will give them leave to reſt; multitudes were ſwimming about, others ſwarmed in the air, and almoſt ſtunned us with the variety of their croaks and ſcreams; I obſerved among them corvorants, ſhags in ſmall flocks, guillemots, a few black guillemots very ſhy and wild, auks, puſſins, kittiwakes <note n="*" place="bottom">Called here <hi>Petrels.

Landed at the ſame place, but before our return to <hi>Flamborough,</hi> viſited <hi>Robin Leith</hi>'s hole, a vaſt cavern, to which there is a narrow paſſage from the land ſide; it ſuddenly riſes to a great height, the roof is finely arched, and the bottom is for a conſiderable way formed in broad ſteps, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a great but eaſy ftair-caſe; the mouth opens to the ſea, and gives light to the whole.</p>
            <p>Lay at <hi>Hunmandby,</hi> a ſmall village above <hi>Filey Bay,</hi> round which are ſome plantations that thrive tolerably well, and ought to be an encouragement to gentlemen to attempt covering theſe naked hills.</p>

            <p>SCARBOROUGH, a large town, built in form of a creſcent on the ſides of a deep hill; at one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity are the ruins of the caſtle ſeated on a cliff of a ſtupendous height, from whence is a very good view of the town. In the caſtle-yard is a handſome barrack for one hundred and fifty men, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent untenanted by ſoldiery. Beneath, on the ſouth ſide, is a large ſtone pier, (another is now build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) which ſhelters the ſhipping belonging to the town. It is a place abſolutely without trade, yet owns above 300 ſail of ſhips, which are hired out for freight: in the late war the Government had never leſs than 100 of them in pay.</p>
            <p>The number of inhabitants belonging to this place are above 10,000, but as great part are ſailors, nothing like that number are reſident, which makes one church ſufficient for thoſe who live on ſhore. It is large, and ſeated almoſt on

the top of the hill. The range of buildings on the <hi>Cliff</hi> commands a fine view of the caſtle, town, and ſhore, and of innumerable ſhipping that are perpetually paſſing backward and forward on their voyages. The ſpaw <note n="*" place="bottom">The waters are impregnated with a purgative ſalt, (<hi>Glauber</hi>'s) a ſmall quantity of common ſalt, and of ſteel.

            <p>The ſhore is a fine hard ſand, and during low water is the place where the company amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with riding. This is alſo the fiſh market; for every day the cobles, or little fiſhing boats, are drawn on ſhore here, and lie in rows, often quite loaden with variety of the beſt fiſh. There was a fiſherman, on the 9th of <hi>May,</hi> 1767, brought in at one time, 20 Cods, 14 Lings, 17 Skates, 8 Holibuts, beſides a vaſt quantity of leſſer fiſh; and ſold the whole for 3l. 15s.

experience, by the augmentation of its fiſheries. For this account, and for numberleſs civilities, I think myſelf much indebted to Mr. <hi>Travis,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, who communicated to me the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scarborough</hi> is ſituated at the bottom of a bay, formed by <hi>Whitby</hi> rock on the North, and <hi>Flambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>-head on the South; the town is ſeated directly oppoſite to the centre of the W. end of the <hi>Dogger</hi> bank; which end, (according to <hi>Hammond</hi>'s chart of the North Sea) lies S. and by W. and N. and by E. but by a line drawn from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> caſtle, would lead about N. W. and S. E. Tho' the <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> bank is therefore but 12 leagues from <hi>Flambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>-head, yet it is 16 and a half from <hi>Scarborough,</hi> 23 from <hi>Whitby,</hi> and 36 from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> caſtle. The N. ſide of the bank ſtretches off E. N. E. between 30 and 40 leagues, untill it almoſt joins to the <hi>Long-Bank,</hi> and <hi>Jutt</hi>'s Riff.</p>
            <p>It is to be remarked, that the fiſhermen ſeldom find any Cod, Ling, or other round fiſh upon the <hi>Dogger</hi> bank itſelf, but on the ſloping edges and hollows contiguous to it. The top of the bank is covered with a barren ſhifting ſand, which affords them no ſubſiſtence; and the water on it, from its ſhallowneſs, is continually ſo agitated and broken, as to allow them no time to reſt. The flat fiſh do not ſuffer the ſame inconvenience there; for when diſturbed by the motion of the ſea, they ſhelter themſelves in the ſand, and find variety of ſuitable food. It is true, the <hi>Dutch</hi> fiſh upon the <hi>Dogger</hi> bank, but it is alſo true they take little except Soles, Skates, Thornbacks, Plaiſe, &amp;c. It is in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0301300200:26"/>
between the <hi>Dogger</hi> and the <hi>Well-Bank,</hi> that the Cod are taken, which ſupply <hi>London</hi> market.</p>
            <p>The ſhore, except at the entrance of <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> pier, and ſome few other places, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of covered rocks, which abound with Lobſters and Crabs, and many other ſhell fiſh, (no Oyſters) thence, after a ſpace covered with clean ſand, extending in different places from one to five or ſix miles. The bottom, all the way to the edge of the <hi>Dogger</hi> banks, is a ſcar; in ſome places very rugged, rocky, and cavernous; in others ſmooth, and overgrown with variety of ſubmarine plants, Moſſes, Corallines, &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">I met with on the ſhores near <hi>Scarborough,</hi> ſmall fragments of the true red coral.</note> ſome parts again are ſpread with ſand and ſhells; others, for many leagues in length, with ſoft mud and ooze, furniſhed by the diſcharge of the <hi>Tees</hi> and <hi>Humber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon an attentive review of the whole, it may be clearly inferred, that the ſhore along the coaſt on the one hand, with the edges of the <hi>Dogger</hi> bank on the other, like the ſides of a decoy, give a direction towards our fiſhing grounds to the mighty ſhoals of Cod, and other fiſh, which are well known to come annually from the Northern ocean into our ſeas; and ſecondly, that the great variety of fiſhing grounds near <hi>Scarborough,</hi> extending upwards of 16 leagues from the ſhore, afford ſecure retreats and plenty of proper food for all the various kinds of fiſh, and alſo ſuitable places for each kind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit their ſpawn in.</p>
            <p>The fiſhery at <hi>Scarbarough</hi> only employs 105 men, and brings in about 5250l. per annum, a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0301300200:27"/>
trifle to what it would produce, was there a canal from thence to <hi>Leeds</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it would then produce above ten times that ſum, employ ſome thouſands of men, give a comfortable and cheap ſubſiſtence to our manufacturers, keep the markers moderately reaſonable, enable our manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing towns to underfell our rivals, and prevent the hands, as is too often the caſe, raiſing inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, in every year of ſcarcity, natural or artificial.</p>
            <p>On diſcourſing with ſome very intelligent fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I was informed of a very ſingular phoenomenon they annually obſerve about the ſpawning of fiſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Oſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

At the diſtance of 4 or 5 leagues from ſhore, during the months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it is remarked, that at the depth of 6 or 7 fathom from the ſurface, the water appears to be ſaturated with a thick jelly, filled with the <hi>Ova</hi> of fiſh, which reaches 10 or 12 fathoms deeper; this is known by its adhering to the ropes the cobles anchor with when they are fiſhing, for they find the firſt 6 or 7 fathom of rope free from ſpawn, the next 10 or 12 covered with ſlimy matter, the remainder again free to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. They ſuppoſe this gelatinous ſtuff to ſupply the new-born fry with food, and that it is alſo a protection to the ſpawn, as being diſagreeable to the larger fiſh to ſwim in.</p>
            <p>There is great variety of fiſh brought on ſhore; beſides thoſe deſcribed as <hi>Britiſh</hi> fiſh, were two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Rays: the Whip-Ray has alſo been taken
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0301300200:28"/>

            <p>Left <hi>Scarborough,</hi> paſſed over large moors to <hi>Robin Hood's Bay.</hi>
               <note place="margin">JULY 10.</note> On my round, obſerved the vaſt mountains of alum ſtone,<note place="margin">Alum Works.</note> from which that ſalt is thus extracted: It is firſt calcined in great heaps, which continue burning by its own phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſton, after being well ſet on fire by coals, for ſix, ten, or fourteen months, according to the ſize of the heap, ſome being equal to a ſmall hill. It is then thrown into pits and ſteeped in water, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract all the ſaline particles. The liquor is then run into other pits, where the vitriolic ſalts are precipitated, by the addition of a ſolution of the <hi>ſal ſode,</hi> prepared from kelp; or by the volatile <hi>alkali</hi> of ſtale urine. The ſuperfluous water being then evaporated duely by boiling in large furnaces, the liquor is ſet to cool; and laſtly, is poured into large caſks, to cryſtallize.</p>
            <p>The alum works of this county are of ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; they were firſt diſcovered by Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner,</hi> in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who obſerving the trees tinged, with an unuſual color, made him ſuſpicious of its being owing to ſome mineral in the neighborhood. He found out that the ſtrata abounded with an aluminous ſalt.</p>
            <p>At that time, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being ſtrangers to the method of managing it, there is a tradition that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was obliged to ſeduce ſome workmen from the <hi>Pope</hi>'s alum-works near <hi>Rome,</hi> then the greateſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> If one may judge from the curſe which his Holineſs thundered out againſt Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0301300200:29"/>
the ſugitives, he certainly was not a little enraged; for he curſed by the very form that <hi>Ernulphus</hi>

            <p>The firſt pits were near <hi>Giſborough,</hi> the ſeat of the <hi>Chaloners,</hi> who ſtill flouriſh there, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Holineſs's <hi>anathema.</hi> The works were ſo valuable as to be deemed a royal mine.

But this monopoly was deſtroyed on the death of <hi>Charles</hi> I. and the right reſtored to the proprietors.</p>
            <p>In theſe alum rocks are frequently found <hi>cornua ammonis,</hi> and other foſſils,<note place="margin">Jet.</note> lodged in a ſtony nodule.

            <p>The ſands near <hi>Robin Hood</hi>'s village were covered with fiſh of ſeveral kinds, and with people who met the cobles in order to purchaſe their cargo: the place ſeemed as if a great fiſh fair had been held there; ſome were carrying off their bargains, others buſied in curing the fiſh; and a little out at ſea was a fleet of cobles and five men boats, and others arriving to diſcharge the capture of the preceding

            <p>WHITBY, called by the <hi>Saxons, Streaneſhalch,</hi> or bay of the light-houſe, a large town, oddly ſituated between two hills, with a narrow channel running through the middle, extending about a mile farther up the vale, where it widens, and forms a bay. The two parts of the town are joined by a good draw-bridge, for the conveniency of letting the ſhipping paſs. From this bridge are often taken the viviparous Blenny, whoſe back-bone is as green as that of the Sea Needle. The river that forms this harbor is the <hi>Eſk,</hi> but its waters are very inconſiderable when the tide is out. Here is a pretty briſk trade in ſhip-building; but except that, a ſmall manufacture of ſail-cloth, and the hiring out of ſhips as at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> like that town it has ſcarce any commerce. It is computed there are about 270 ſhips belonging to this place. Of late, an attempt has been made to have a ſhare in the <hi>Greenland</hi> fiſhery; four ſhips were ſent out, and had very good ſucceſs. There are very good dry
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0301300200:31"/>
docks towards the end of the harbor; and at the mouth a moſt beautifull pier. At this place is the firſt ſalmon-fiſhery on the coaſt.</p>
            <p>On the hill above the S. ſide of the town is a fine ruin of St. <hi>Hilda</hi>'s church.<note place="margin">St. <hi>Hilda</hi>'s church.</note> The ſite was given to that ſaint by <hi>Oſwy,</hi> king of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> about A.

At the end of this moor, about three miles from <hi>Giſborough,</hi> is a beautifull view over the remaining part of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> towards <hi>Durham, Hartlepool,</hi> and the mouth of the <hi>Tees,</hi> which maeanders through a very rich tract. The country inſtantly aſſumes a new face; the road lies between moſt delightfull hills finely wooded, and the little vales between them very fertile: on ſome of the hills are the marks of the firſt alum works, which were diſcovered by Sir <hi>Thomas Chaloner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GISBOROUGH, a ſmall town, pleaſantly ſituated in a vale,<note place="margin">GISBOROUGH.</note> ſurrounded at ſome diſtance by hills, and open on the eaſt to the ſea, which is about five miles diſtant. It is certainly a delightfull ſpot, but I cannot ſee the reaſon why <hi>Cambden</hi> compares it to <hi>Puteoli.</hi> Here was once a priory of the canons of the order of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> founded by <hi>Robert de Brus,</hi> 1129, after the diſſolution granted by <hi>Edward</hi> VI. to the <hi>Chaloners:</hi> a very beautifull eaſt window of the church is ſtill remaining. The town has at preſent a good manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of ſail cloth.</p>
            <p>The country continues very fine quite to the banks of the <hi>Tees,</hi> a conſiderable river, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> from the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham.</hi> After travelling 109 miles in a ſtrait line through the firſt, enter <hi>Durham,</hi> croſſing the river on a very handſome bridge of arches, the battlements neatly panneled with ſtone; and reach</p>
            <p>STOCKTON, lying on the <hi>Tees</hi> in form of a creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. A handſome town; the principal ſtreet is remarkably fine, being 165 feet broad; and ſeveral leſſer ſtreets run into it at right angles. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the great ſtreet are neat ſhambles, a town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0301300200:33"/>
and large aſſembly-room. There is beſides a large ſquare. About a century ago, according to <hi>Anderſon,</hi> it had ſcarce a houſe that was not made of clay and thatch; but is now a flouriſhing place. Its manufacture is ſail cloth; and great quantities of corn, and lead, (from the mineral parts of the county) are ſent off from hence by commiſſion. As the river does not admit of large veſſels ſo high as the town, thoſe commodities are ſent down to be ſhipped.</p>
            <p>The ſalmon fiſhery here is neglected, for none are taken beyond what is neceſſary to ſupply the country. Smelts come up the river in the winter time. On the weſt ſide of the town ſtood the caſtle; what remained of it is at preſent converted into a barn. The country from hence to <hi>Durham</hi> is flat, very fertile, and much incloſed. Towards the weſt is a fine view of the highlands of the country: thoſe hills are part of that vaſt ridge which commence in the north and deeply divide this portion of the kingdom; and on that account are called by <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> the <hi>Appennines</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The approach to DURHAM is romantic,<note place="margin">DURHAM.</note> through a deep hollow, cloathed on each ſide with wood. The city is pretty large, but the buildings old. Part are on a plain, part on the ſide of a hill. The abby, or cathedral, and the caſtle, where the Biſhop lives when he reſides here, are on the ſummit of a cliff, whoſe foot is waſhed on two ſides by the river <hi>Were.</hi> The walks on rhe oppoſite banks are very beautifull, flagged in the middle and paved on the ſides, and are well kept. They are cut through
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0301300200:34"/>
the wood, impend over the river, and receive a venerable improvement from the caſtle and antient cathedral which ſoar above.</p>
            <p>The laſt is very old <note n="*" place="bottom">Begun in 1093, by Biſhop <hi>William de Carilepho.</hi>
               </note>; plain without, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported within by maſſy pillars, deeply engraved with lozenge-like figures, and zigzag furrows: others are plain; and each forms a cluſter of pillars. The ſkreen to the choir is wood covered with a coarſe carving. The choir neat, but without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</p>
            <p>The chapter-houſe ſeems very antient, and is in the form of a theatre. The cloiſters large and handſome. All the monuments are defaced, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of Biſhop <hi>Hatfield.</hi> The Prebendal houſes are very pleaſantly ſituated, and have a fine view backwards.</p>
            <p>There are two handſome bridges over the <hi>Were</hi> to the walks; and a third covered with houſes, which join the two parts of the town. This river produces Salmon, Trout, Roach, Dace, Minow, Loche, Bullhead, Sticklebacks, Lamprey, the leſſer Lamprey, Eels, Smelts and Samlet, which are called here <hi>Rack-riders,</hi> becauſe they appear in winter, or bad weather; <hi>Rack,</hi> in the northern dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, ſignifying the driving of the clouds by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. It is obſerved here, that before they go off to ſpawn, thoſe fiſh are covered with a white ſlime.</p>
            <p>There is no inconſiderable manufacture, at <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of ſhalloons, tammies, ſtripes and callaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes. I had heard on my road many complaints of the eccleſiaſtical government this county is ſubject

            <p>Saw <hi>Coker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">JULY 12.</note> the ſeat of Mr. <hi>Car;</hi> a moſt romantic ſituation, layed out with great judgment; the walks are very extenſive, principally along the ſides or at the bottom of deep dells, bounded with vaſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, finely wooded; and many parts of the rocks are planted with vines, which I was told bore well, but late. The river <hi>Were</hi> winds along the hollows, and forms two very fine reaches at the place where you enter theſe walks. Its waters are very clear, and its bottom a ſolid rock. The view towards the ruins of <hi>Finchal</hi>-Abby is remarkably great; and the walk beneath the cliffs has a magnificent ſolemnity, a fit retreat for its monaſtic inhabitants. This was once called the Deſert, and was the rude ſcene of the auſterities of St. <hi>Godric,</hi> who carried them to the moſt ſenſeleſs extravagance <note n="*" place="bottom">St. <hi>Godric</hi> was born at <hi>Walpole</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and being an itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant merchant got acquainted with St. <hi>Cuthbtert</hi> at <hi>Farn Iſland.</hi> He made three pilgrimages to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> at length, was warned by a viſion to ſettle in the deſert of <hi>Finchal.</hi> He lived a hermetical life there during 63 years, and practiſed unheard of auſterities: he wore an iron ſhirt next his ſkin, day and night, and wore out three: he mingled aſhes with the flower he made his bread of; and, leaſt it ſhould then be too good, kept it three or four months before he ventured to eat it. In winter, as well as ſummer, he paſſed whole nights, up to his chin in water, at his devotions. Like St. <hi>Antony,</hi> he was often haunted by fiends in various ſhapes; ſometimes in form of beautifull damſels, ſo was viſited with evil concupiſcence, which he cured by rolling naked among thorns and briars: his body grew ulcerated; but, to encreaſe his pain, he poured ſalt into the wounds. Wrought many miracles, and died 1170. <hi>Britannia ſacra,</hi> 304. About ten years after his deceaſe, a <hi>Benedictine</hi> priory of thirteen monks was founded there in his honor, by <hi>Hugh Pudſey,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham.</hi>
               </note>. A ſober mind may even at preſent be affected with horror at the proſpect from the ſummits of the cliffs into a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſtupendous chaſm, rendered ſtill more

            <p>Paſſed through <hi>Cheſter-le-Street,</hi> a ſmall town, near which is <hi>Lumly-Caſtle,</hi> the ſeat of the Earl of <hi>Scarborough;</hi> a place, as I was told, very well worth ſeeing; but unfortunately it proved a public day, and I loſt ſight of it. The country, from <hi>Durham</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> was very beautifull; the riſings gentle, and prettily wooded, and the views agreeable; that on the borders remarkably fine, there being, from an eminence not far from the capital of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> an extenſive view of a rich country, watered by the coaly <hi>Tyne.</hi> Reach</p>
            <p>NEWCASTLE, a large, diſagreeable, and dirty town,<note place="margin">NEWCASTLE.</note> divided in two unequal parts by the river, and both ſides very ſteep. The lower parts are inhabited by Keelmen and their families, a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous race; for which reaſon this town is always garriſoned.</p>
            <p>The great buſineſs of the place is the coal trade. The collieries lie at different diſtances, from five to eighteen miles from the river; and the coal is brought down in waggons along rail roads, and diſcharged from covered buildings at the edge of the water into the keels or boats that are to convey it on ſhipboard. Theſe boats are ſtrong, clumſy and round, will carry about 25 tuns each; ſometimes are navigated with a ſquare ſail, but generally are puſhed along with large poles. No ſhips of large burthen can come up as high as <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> but are obliged to lie at <hi>Shields,</hi> a few miles down the river, where ſtage coaches go thrice every day for the conveniency of paſſengers. This country is moſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0301300200:37"/>
remarkably populous; <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> alone contains near 40,000 inhabitants; and there are at leſt 400 ſail of ſhips belonging to that town and its port. The effect of the vaſt commerce of this place is very apparent for many miles round; the country is finely cultivated, and bears a moſt thriving and opulent aſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">JULY 13.</note>Left <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> the country in general flat; paſſed by a large ſtone column with three dials on the capital, with ſeveral ſcripture texts on the ſides, called here <hi>Pigg</hi>'s Folly, from the founder.</p>
            <p>A few miles further is <hi>Stannington</hi> Bridge, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant village. <hi>Morpeth,</hi> a ſmall town with a neat town-houſe, and a tower for the bell near it. The caſtle was on a ſmall eminence, but the remains are now very inconſiderable. Some attempt was made a few years ago to introduce the <hi>Mancheſter</hi> manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, but without ſucceſs. There is a remarkable ſtory of this place, that the inhabitants reduced their own town to aſhes, on the approach of King <hi>John,</hi> A. D. 1215, out of pure hatred to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, in order that he might not find any ſhelter there.</p>
            <p>This place gave birth to <hi>William Turner,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> expreſſes it, an excellent <hi>Latiniſt, Graecian, Oratour,</hi> and <hi>Poet;</hi> he might have added polemic divine, champion and ſufferer in the proteſtant cauſe, phyſician and naturaliſt. His botanic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are among the firſt we had, and certainly the beſt of them; and his criticiſms on the birds of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> are very judicious. He was the firſt who flung any light on thoſe ſubjects in our

You look in vain for the <hi>helmet</hi> on the tower, the antient ſignal of hoſpitality to the traveller, or for the grey-headed porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment. The numerous train, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances gave welcome to him on his way, are now no more; and inſtead of the diſintereſted uſher of the old times, he is attended by a <hi>valet</hi> eager to receive the fees of admittance.</p>
            <p>There is vaſt grandeur in the appearance of the outſide of the caſtle; the towers magnificent, but injured by the numbers of rude ſtatues crouded on the battlements. The appartments are large, and lately finiſhed in the gothic ſtyle with a moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible elegance. The gardens are equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, trim to the higheſt degree, and more adapted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0301300200:39"/>
to a <hi>villa</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> than the antient ſeat of a great Baron. In a word, nothing, except the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of uninduſtrious poor that ſwarm at the gate, excites any one idea of its former circumſtances.</p>
            <p>A ſtage further is <hi>Belford,</hi> the ſeat of <hi>Abraham Dixon,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a modern houſe; the front has a moſt beautifull ſimplicity in it.

It was alſo his opinion, that the ſquare tower was actually the work of the <hi>Romans.</hi> It had been of great ſtrength; the hill it is founded on exceſſively ſteep on all ſides, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible only by flights of ſteps on the ſouth eaſt. The ruins are ſtill conſiderable; the remains of a great hall are very ſingular; it had been warmed by two fire-places of a vaſt ſize, and from the top of every window ran a flue, like that of a chimney, which reached the ſummits of the battlements. Many of the ruins are now filled with ſand, caught up by the winds that rage here with great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity, and carried to very diſtant places.</p>
            <p>This caſtle, and the manour belonging to it, was once the property of the <hi>Forſters;</hi> but purchaſed

Three of theſe Truſtees are a majority: one of them makes this place his reſidence, and bleſſes the coaſt by his judicious and humane application of the Prelate's generous bequeſt. He has repaired and rendered habitable the great ſquare tower: the part reſerved for himſelf and family is a large hall and a few ſmaller apartments; but the reſt of the ſpacious edifice is allotted for purpoſes which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of. The upper part is an ample grainary; from whence corn is diſpenced to the poor without diſtinction, even in the deareſt time, at the rate of four ſhillings a buſhel; and the diſtreſſed, for many miles round, often experience the conveniency of this benefaction.</p>
            <p>Other apartments are fitted up for the reception of ſhipwrecked ſailors; and bedding is provided for about thirty, ſhould ſuch a number happen to be caſt on ſhore at the ſame time. A conſtant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole is kept every ſtormy night along this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous coaſt, for above eight miles, the length of the manour, by which means numbers of lives have been preſerved. Many poor wretches are often found on the ſhore in a ſtate of inſenſibility; but by timely relief, are ſoon brought to themſelves.</p>
            <p>It often happens, that ſhips ſtrike in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on the rocks as to be capable of relief, in caſe numbers of people could be ſuddenly aſſembled: for that purpoſe a cannon <note n="*" place="bottom">Once belonging to a <hi>Dutch</hi> frigate of 40 guns; which, with all the crew, was loſt oppoſite to the caſtle, about ſixty years ago.</note> is fixed on the top of

the tower, which is fired once, if the accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in ſuch a quarter; twice, if in another, and thrice, if in ſuch a place. By theſe ſignals the country people are directed to the ſpot they are to fly to; and by this means, frequently preſerve not only the crew, but even the veſſel; for machines of different kinds are always in readineſs to heave ſhips out of their perillous ſituation.</p>
            <p>In a word, all the ſchemes of this worthy Truſtee have a humane and uſeful tendency: he ſeemed as if ſelected from his brethren for the ſame purpoſes as <hi>Spenſer</hi> tells us the firſt of his ſeven <hi>Beadſmen</hi> in the houſe of <hi>holineſſe</hi> was.</p>

            <p>After a few miles riding, have a full view of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and the river <hi>Tweed</hi> winding weſtward for a conſiderable way up the country; but its banks were without any particular charms <note n="*" place="bottom">I was informed that the beautifull banks of the <hi>Tweed</hi> verify the old fong at the paſſage at <hi>Colſtream.</hi>

            <p>BERWICK is fortified in the modern way; but is much contracted in its extent to what it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the old caſtle and works now lying at ſome diſtance beyond the preſent ramparts. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks are large, conſiſt of a center and two wings. The church was built by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and, according to the ſpirit of the builder, without a ſteeple. Even in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> (towards the borders) the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples grew leſs and leſs, and as if it were forewarned the traveller that he was ſpeedily to take leave of epiſcopacy. The town-houſe has a large and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome modern tower to it: the ſtreets in general are narrow and bad, except that in which the town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſtands.</p>
            <p>Abundance of wool is exported from this town: eggs in vaſt abundance collected through all the

            <p>The ſalmon fiſheries here are very conſiderable,<note place="margin">Salmon fiſhery.</note> and likewiſe bring in vaſt ſums: they lie on each ſide the river; and are all private property, except what belongs to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Durham,</hi> which, in rent and tythe of fiſh, brings in 450l. <hi>per ann.</hi> for all the other fiſheries are liable to tythe. The common rents of thoſe are 50l. a year, for which the tenants have as much ſhore as ſerves to launch out and draw their nets on ſhore: the limits of each are ſtaked; and I obſerved that the fiſhers never failed going as near as poſſible to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor's limits. One man goes off in a ſmall flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottomed boat, ſquare at one end, and taking as large a circuit as his net admits, brings it on ſhore at the extremity of his boundary, where others aſſiſt in landing it.

            <p>At Lord <hi>Dunmore</hi>'s lodgings is a very large piece of <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his Queen going to ride, with the ſky ſhowering roſes on them; a Black holds a grey horſe, a boy a ſpaniel, with ſeveral other dogs ſporting round: the Queen is painted with a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and with browner hair and complection, and younger, than I ever ſaw her drawn. It is a good piece, and ſaid to be done by <hi>Vandyck?</hi> in the ſame place are two other good portraits of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and <hi>James</hi> VII.</p>
            <p>The gallery of this palace takes up one ſide, and is filled with coloſſal portraits of the Kings of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Parks.</note> Near this palace are the <hi>Parks</hi> firſt incloſed by <hi>James</hi> V. within are the vaſt rocks <note n="*" place="bottom">According to <hi>Maitland,</hi> their perpendicular height is 656 feet.</note> known by the names of <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Seat and <hi>Saluſbury's Craigs;</hi> their fronts exhibit a romantic and wild ſcene of broken rocks and vaſt precipices, which from ſome points ſeem to over-hang the lower parts of the city. Great columns of ſtone, from forty to fifty feet in length, and about two feet in diameter, regularly pentagonal, or hexagonal, hang down the face of ſome of theſe rocks almoſt perpendicularly, or with a very ſlight dip, and form a ſtrange appearance. Conſiderable quantities of ſtone from the quarries have been cut and ſent to <hi>London</hi> for paving the ſtreets, its great hardneſs rendering it excellent for that purpoſe. Beneath theſe hills are ſome of the moſt beautifull walks about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fine proſpect over ſeveral parts of the country.</p>
            <p>On one ſide of the <hi>Park</hi> are the ruins of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s chapel, once the reſort of numberleſs vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</p>
            <p>The ſouth part of the city has ſeveral things worth viſiting.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herriot</hi>'s Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</note> 
               <hi>Herriot</hi>'s hoſpital is a fine old building, much too magnificent for the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that of educating poor children: it was founded by <hi>George Herriot,</hi> jeweller to <hi>James</hi> II. who followed that monarch to <hi>London,</hi> and made a large fortune. There is a fine view of the caſtle and the ſloping part of the city from the front: the gardens were formerly the reſort of the gay; and there the <hi>Scotch</hi> Poets often laid, in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, the ſcenes of intrigue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0301300200:61"/>
In the church-yard of the Grey Friers is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of Sir <hi>George Mackenſie,</hi> a rotunda; with a multitude of other tombs; this, and another near the <hi>Cannon-gate</hi> being the only caemeteries to this populous city.</p>
            <p>The college is a mean building; but no one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in it except the Principal,<note place="margin">College.</note> whoſe houſe is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be on the ſite of that in which <hi>George Darnly</hi> was murdered, then belonging to the Provoſt of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Field.</hi> The ſtudents of the univerſity are diſperſed over the town, and are about ſix hundred in number: they wear no habit, nor are they ſubject to any regulations; but, as they are for the moſt part volunteers for knowledge, few of them deſert her ſtandards. There are twenty-two profeſſors of different ſciences, moſt of whom read lectures: all the chairs are very ably filled; thoſe in particular which relate to the ſtudy of medicine, as is evident from the number of ingenious phyſicians, <hi>eleves</hi> of this univerſity, who prove the abilities of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The <hi>Muſaeum</hi> had, for many years, been neglected; but, by the aſſiduity of the preſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of natural hiſtory, bids fair to become a moſt inſtructive repoſitory of the <hi>naturalia</hi> of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>The royal infirmary is a ſpatious and handſome aedifice,<note place="margin">Infirmary.</note> capable of containing two hundred patients. The operation-room is particularly convenient, the council-room elegant, with a good picture in it of Provoſt <hi>Drummond.</hi> From the cupolo of this building is a fine proſpect, and a full view of the city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0301300200:62"/>
Not far from hence are twenty-ſeven acres of ground, deſigned for a ſquare, called <hi>George Square:</hi> a ſmall portion is at preſent built, conſiſting of ſmall but commodious houſes, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhion. Such is the ſpirit of emprovement, that within theſe three years ſixty thouſand pounds have been expended in houſes in the modern taſte, and twenty thouſand in the old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Watſon</hi>'s hoſpital ſhould not be forgot: a large good building, behind the Grey Friers church; an excellent inſtitution for the educating and appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing the children of decayed merchants; who, after having ſerved their time with credit, receive fifty pounds to ſet up with.</p>
            <p>The <hi>meadows,</hi> or public walks, are well planted, and are very extenſive: theſe are the mall of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> as <hi>Comely Gardens</hi> are its <hi>Vauxhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cowgate</hi> is a long ſtreet, running parallel with the <hi>High Street,</hi> beneath the ſteep ſouthern declivity of the city, and terminates in the <hi>Graſs-Market,</hi> a wide ſtreet, where cattle are ſold, and criminals executed. On ſeveral of the houſes are ſmall iron croſſes, which, I was informed, denoted that they once belonged to the Knights of St. <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the north ſide of the city lies the new town, which is planned with great judgement, and will prove a magnificent addition to <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> the houſes in St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s ſquare coſt from 1800l. to 2000l. each, and one or two 4000 or 5000l. They are all built in the modern ſtyle, and are free from the inconveniences attending the old city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0301300200:63"/>
Theſe improvements are connected to the city by a very beautifull bridge, whoſe higheſt arch is ninety-five feet high.</p>
            <p>In the walk of this evening, I paſſed by a deep and wide hollow beneath <hi>Calton</hi> Hill, the place where thoſe imaginary criminals, witches and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, in leſs enlightened times, were burnt; and where, at feſtive ſeaſons, the gay and galant held their tilts and tournaments: at one of theſe, it is ſaid, that the Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> made the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the ſuſceptible heart of <hi>Mary Stuart,</hi> having galopped into the ring down the dangerous ſteeps of the adjacent hill; he ſeemed to think that</p>

            <p>Theſe deſperate feats were the humour of the times of chivalry: <hi>Brantome</hi> relates, that the <hi>Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Nemours</hi> galopped down the ſteps of the <hi>Sainte Chappel</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to the aſtoniſhment of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. The men cultivated every exerciſe that could preſerve or improve their bodily ſtrength; the ladies, every art that tended to improve their charms: <hi>Mary</hi> is reported to have uſed a bath of white wine; a cuſtom ſtrange, but not without precedent. <hi>Jaques du Fouilloux,</hi> enraptured with a country girl enumerating the arts which ſhe ſcorned to uſe to improve her perſon, mentions this:</p>

It is finely ſtocked with plants, whoſe arrangement and cultivation do much credit to my worthy friend Dr. <hi>Hope,</hi> Profeſſor of Botany, who planned and executed the whole.

Many fine excurſions may be made at a ſmall diſtance from this city. <hi>Leith,</hi> a large town,<note place="margin">LEITH.</note> about two miles north, lies on the <hi>Firth,</hi> is a flouriſhing place, and the port of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The town is dirty and ill built, and chiefly inhabited by ſailors; but the pier is very fine, and is a much-frequented walk. The races were at this time on the ſands, near low-water mark: conſidering their vicinity to a great city and populous country, the meeting was far from numerous; a proof that diſſipation has not generally infected the manners of the <hi>North Britons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Craigmellar</hi> caſtle is ſeated on a rocky eminence, about two miles ſouth of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> is ſquare, and has towers at each corner. Some few apartments are yet inhabited; but the reſt of this great pile is in ruins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newbottle,</hi> the ſeat of the Marquiſs of <hi>Lothian,</hi> is a pleaſant ride of a few miles from the capital.

The ſituation is very favorable to trees, as appears by the vaſt ſize of thoſe near the houſe; and I was informed, that fruit ripens here within ten days as early as at <hi>Chelſea.</hi>

            <p>The flouriſhing ſtate of <hi>Perth</hi> is owing to two accidents: the firſt, that of numbers of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s wounded officers and ſoldiers chuſing to reſide here, after he left the kingdom, who introduced a ſpirit of induſtry among the people: the other cauſe was the long continuance of the Earl of <hi>Mar</hi>'s army here in 1715, which occaſioned vaſt ſums of money being ſpent in the place: but this town, as well as all <hi>Scotland,</hi> dates its proſperity from the year 1745, the government of this part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> having never been ſettled till a little after that time.

            <p>He alſo favoured me with the fight of a very antient brotche, which the Highlanders uſe, like the <hi>fibula</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to faſten their veſt: it is made of ſilver, is round, with a bar croſs the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, from whence are two tongues to faſten the ſolds of the garments: one ſide is ſtudded with pearl, or coarſe gems, in a very rude manner; on the other, are certain letters I could not make out.</p>

            <p>I was informed, that Lord <hi>Breadalbane</hi>'s eſtate was ſo extenſive that he could ride a hundred miles an end on it, even as far as the Weſt Sea, where he has alſo ſome iſlands. Theſe great properties are divided into diſtricts, called <hi>Officiaries:</hi> a ground officer preſides over each, and has three, four, or five hundred men under his care: he ſuperintends the duties due from each to their Lord, ſuch as fetching peat, bringing coal from <hi>Perth,</hi> &amp;c. which they do, at their own expence, on horſes backs, travelling in ſtrings, the tail of one horſe being faſtened by a cord, which reaches to the head of the next: the horſes are little, and generally white or grey; and as the farms are very ſmall, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for four people to keep a plough between them, each furniſhing a horſe, and this is called a horſe gang.</p>
            <p>The north ſide of <hi>Loch-Tay</hi> is very populous; for in ſixteen ſquare miles are ſeventeen hundred and eighty-ſix ſouls: on the other ſide, about twelve hundred. The country, within theſe thirty years, is grown very induſtrious, and manufactures a great deal of thread. They ſpin with rocks <note n="*" place="bottom">Their Lord gives among them annually a great number of ſpinning-wheels.</note>, which they do while they attend their cattle on the hills;

            <p>Much of this may be owing to the good ſenſe and humanity of the chieftain; but much again is owing to the abolition of the ſeudal tenures, or vaſſalage; for before that was effected (which was done by the influence of a Chancellor <note n="*" place="bottom">Earl of <hi>Hardwick.</hi>

            <p>The belief in ſpectres ſtill exiſts;<note place="margin">Spectres.</note> of which I had a remarkable proof while I was in the county of <hi>Breadalbane:</hi> a poor viſionary, who had been working in his cabbage-garden, imagined that he was raiſed ſuddenly into the air, and conveyed over a wall into an adjacent corn-field; that he found himſelf ſurrounded by a crowd of men and women, many of whom he knew to have been dead ſome years, and who appeared to him ſkimming over the tops of the unbended corn, and mingling together like bees going to hive: that they ſpoke an unknown language, and with a hollow found: that they very roughly puſhed him to and fro; but on his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of GOD, all vaniſhed but a female ſprite, who ſeizing him by the ſhoulder, obliged him to promiſe an aſſignation, at that very hour, that day ſevenight: that he then found that his hair was all tied in double knots, and that he had almoſt loſt the uſe of his ſpeech: that he kept his word with the ſpectre, whom he ſoon ſaw come floating thro' the air towards him: that he ſpoke to her, but ſhe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0301300200:100"/>
told him at that time ſhe was in too much haſte to attend to him, but bid him go away, and no harm ſhould befall him; and ſo the affair reſted when I left the country. But it is incredible the miſchief theſe <hi>AEgri Somnia</hi> did in the neighborhood: the friends and relation of the deceaſed, whom the old Dreamer had named, were in the utmoſt anxiety at finding them in ſuch bad company in the other world: the almoſt extinct belief of the old idle tales began again to gain ground, and the good miniſter will have many a weary diſcourſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation before he can eradicate the abſurd ideas this idle ſtory has revived.</p>
            <p>In this part of the country the notion of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft is quite loſt: it was obſerved to ceaſe almoſt immediately on the repeal of the witch act; a proof what a dangerous inſtrument it was in the hands of the vindictive, or of the credulous.</p>

Further, there were two great rounds in ilk ſide of the gate, and a great portculleis of tree, falling down with the manner of a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, with a draw-bridge, and a great ſtank of water of ſixteen foot deep, and thirty foot of breadth. And alſo this palace within was hung with fine tapeſtry and arraſſes of ſilk, and lighted with fine glaſs windows in all airths; that this palace was as pleaſantly decored, with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries pertaining to a prince, as it had been his own palace-royal at home. Further, this Earl gart make ſuch proviſion for the King, and his Mother, and the Embaſſador, that they had all manner of meats, drinks, and delicates that were to be gotten, at that time, in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> either in burgh or land; that is to ſay, all kind of drink, as ale, beer, wine, both white and claret, <hi>malvery, muſkadel, Hippocras, aquavitae.</hi> Further, there was of meats, wheat-bread, main-bread and ginge-bread; with fleſhes, beef, mutton, lamb, veal, veniſon, gooſe, grice, capon, coney, cran, ſwan, partridge, plover, duck, drake, briſſel-cock and pawnies, black-cock and muir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, cappercaillies: and alſo the ſtanks, that were round about the palace, were full of all delicate fiſhes, as ſalmonds, trouts, pearches,

pikes, eels, and all other kind of delicate fiſhes that could be gotten in freſh waters; and all ready for the banket. Syne were there proper ſtewards, cunning baxters, excellent cooks and potingars, with confections and drugs for their deſerts; and the halls and chambers were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with coſtly bedding, veſſel and napery, according for a king, ſo that he wanted none of his orders more than he had been at home in his own palace.

compaſſe, they doe bring or chaſe in the deer in many heards (two, three, or four hundred in a heard) to ſuch or ſuch a place, as the noblemen ſhall appoint them; then when day is come, the lords and gentlemen of their companies doe ride or go to the ſaid places, ſometimes wading up to the middles through bournes and rivers; and then they being come to the place, doe lye down on the ground till thoſe foreſaid ſcouts, which are called the <hi>Tinekhell,</hi> do bring down the deer; but, as the proverb ſays of a bad cooke, ſo theſe <hi>Tinckhell</hi> men doe lick their own ſingers; for, beſides their bowes and arrows which they carry with them, wee can heare now and then a hargue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, or a muſquet, goe off, which doe ſeldom diſcharge in vaine: then after we had ſtayed three houres, or there abouts, we might perceive the deer appeare on the hills round about us, (their heads making a ſhew like a wood) which being followed cloſe by the <hi>Tinckhell,</hi> are chaſed down into the valley where wee lay; then all the valley on each ſide being way-laid with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred couple of ſtrong Iriſh grey-hounds, they are let looſe, as occaſion ſerves, upon the heard of deere, that with dogs, gunnes, arrowes, durks and daggers, in the ſpace of two houres fourſcore fat deere were ſlaine, which after are diſpoſed of ſome one way and ſome another, twenty or thirty miles, and more than enough left for us to make merry withall at our rendevouze.

Paſs by the caſtle of <hi>Brae-mar,</hi> a ſquare tower, built about a hundred and fifty years ago, to curb the diſcontented chieftains; but at preſent unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily garriſoned by a company of foot, being rented by the Government from Mr. <hi>Farquharſon</hi> of <hi>Invercauld,</hi> whoſe houſe I reached in leſs than half an hour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Invercauld</hi> is ſeated in the centre of the <hi>Grampian</hi> hills, in a fertile vale, waſhed by the <hi>Dee,</hi> a large and rapid river: nothing can be more beautifull than the different views from the ſeveral parts of it. On the northern entrance, immenſe ragged and broken crags bound one ſide of the proſpect; over whoſe grey ſides and ſummits is ſcattered the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly green of the pictureſque pine, which grows out of the naked rock, where one would think na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have denied vegetation.</p>
            <p>A little lower down is the caſtle above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; formerly a neceſſary curb on the little kings of the country; but at preſent ſerves ſcarce any real purpoſe, but to adorn the landſcape.</p>
            <p>The views from the ſkirts of the plain, near <hi>Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauld,</hi> are very great; the hills that immediately bound it are cloathed with trees, particularly with birch, whoſe long and pendent boughs, waving a vaſt height above the head, ſurpaſs the beauties of the weeping willow.</p>
            <p>The ſouthern extremity is pre-eminently magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent; the mountains form there a vaſt theatre, the boſom of which is covered with extenſive foreſts of pines: above, the trees grow ſcarcer and ſcarcer, and then ſeem only to ſprinkle the ſurface; after

            <p>Tenants pay their rent generally in this country in money, except what they pay in poultry, which is done to promote the breed, as the gentry are ſo remote from any market. Thoſe that rent a mill pay a hog or two; an animal ſo deteſted by the Highlanders, that very few can be prevaled on to taſte it, in any ſhape. Labor is here very cheap, the uſual pay being fifty ſhillings a year, and two pecks of oatmeal a week.</p>
            <p>Purſued my journey eaſt,<note place="margin">AUG. 6.</note> along a beautifull road by the river ſide, in ſight of the pine foreſts. The vale now grows narrow, and is filled with woods of birch and alder. Saw on the road-ſide the ſeats of gentlemen high built, and once defenſible.

            <p>This paſs is the eaſtern entrance into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.

At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, its imports are from the <hi>Baltic,</hi> and a few merchants trade to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>North America.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stocking trade.</note> Its exports are ſtockings, thread, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and oat-meal: the firſt is a moſt important article, as appears by the following ſtate of it. For this manufacture, 20,800 pounds worth of wool is annually imported, and 1600 pounds worth of oil. Of this wool is annually made 69,333 dozen pairs of ſtockings, worth, at an average, 1l. 10s. <hi>per</hi> dozen. Theſe are made by the country people, in almoſt all parts of this great county, who get 4s. <hi>per</hi> dozen for ſpinning, and 14s. <hi>per</hi> dozen for knitting; ſo that there is annually paid

them 62,329l. 14s. And beſides, there is about 2000l. value of ſtockings manufactured from the wool of the county, which encourages the breed of ſheep much; for even as high as <hi>Invercauld,</hi> the farmer ſells his ſheep at twelve ſhillings apiece, and keeps them till they are four or five years old, for the ſake of the wool.

            <p>The town of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> is in general well built, with granite from the neighboring quarries.

and the ſea fowl clamor above and below, forming a ſtrange proſpect and ſingular chorus. The place was once deſenſible, there having been a ditch and draw-bridge on the acceſſible ſide; but now both are deſtroyed.</p>

            <p>The land proſpect is extremely unpleaſant; for no trees will grow here, in ſpite of all the pains that have been taken: not but in former times it muſt have been well wooded, as is evident from the numbers of trees dug up in all the bogs. The

Theſe publick works were at firſt very diſagreeable to the old Chieftains: it leſſened their influence greatly; for by admitting ſtrangers among them their clans were taught that the Lairds were not the firſt of men. But they had another reaſon much more ſolid: <hi>Lochaber</hi> had been a den of thieves; and as long as they had their waters, their torrents and their bogs, in a ſtate of nature, they made their excurſions, could plunder and retreat with their booty in full ſecurity. So weak were the laws in many parts of <hi>North Britain,</hi> till after the late rebellion, that no ſtop could be put to this infamous practice. A contribution, called the <hi>black meal,</hi> was raiſed by ſeveral of theſe plundering chieftains over a vaſt extent of country: whoever payed it had their cattle enſured, but thoſe. who dared to refuſe were ſure to ſuffer. Many of theſe free-booters were wont to inſert an article, by which they were to be releaſed from their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in caſe of any civil commotion: thus, at the breaking out of the laſt rebellion, a <hi>M'Gregor,</hi>

The whole is placed on a cloth; the grinder pours the corn into the hole with one hand, and with the other turns round the upper ſtone with a very rapid motion, while the meal runs out at the ſides on the cloth. This is rather preſerved as a curioſity, being much out of uſe at preſent. Such are ſuppoſed to be the ſame with what are common among the <hi>Moors,</hi> being the ſimple ſubſtitute of a mill.</p>

            <p>The roads are excellent; but from <hi>Fort William</hi> to <hi>Kinloch-Leven,</hi> very injudiciouſly planned, often carried far about, and often ſo ſteep as to be ſcarce ſurmountable; whereas had the engineer followed the track uſed by the inhabitants, thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences would have been avoided.</p>
            <p>Theſe roads, by rendering the highlands acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, contributed much to their preſent improvement, and were owing to the induſtry of our ſoldiery; they were begun in 1723 <note n="*" place="bottom">

Many of theſe rocks were too hard to yield to the pick-ax, and the miner was obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their obſtinacy with gunpowder, and often in places where nature had denied him footing, and where he was forced to begin his labors, ſuſpended from above by ropes on the face of the horrible

precipice. The bogs and moors had likewiſe their difficulties to overcome; but all wore it length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield to the perſeverence of our troops.</p>
            <p>In ſome places I obſerved, that, after the manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they left engraven on the rocks the names of the regiment each party belonged to, who were employed in theſe works; nor were they leſs worthy of being immortalized than the <hi>Vexillatio</hi>'s of the <hi>Roman</hi> legions; for civilization was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the labors of both.</p>

boats, with four men in each, are employed. A chain of nets is uſed (for ſeveral are united) of a hundred fathoms in length. As the herrings ſwim at very uncertain depths, ſo the nets are ſunk to the depth the ſhoal is found to take: the ſucceſs therefore depends much on the judgement or good fortune of the fiſhers, in taking their due depths; for it often happens that one boat will take multitudes, while the next does not catch a ſingle fiſh, which makes the boatmen perpetually enquire of each other about the depth of their nets. Theſe are kept up by buoys to a proper pitch; the ropes that run through them are faſtened with pegs, and by drawing up or letting out the rope (after taking out the pegs) they adjuſt their ſituation, and then replace them. Sometimes the fiſh ſwim in twenty fathom water, ſometimes in fifty, and oftentimes even at the bottom.</p>
            <p>It is computed that each boat gets about 40l. in the ſeaſon. The fiſh are either ſalted, and packed in barrels for exportation, or ſold freſh to the country people, two or three hundred horſes being brought every day to the water-ſide from very diſtant parts. A barrel holds 500 herrings, if they are of the beſt kind; at a medium, 700: but if more, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a barrel will hold 1000, they are reckoned very poor.

After I left <hi>Lockerby,</hi> Nature, as if exhauſted with her labors in the lofty hills of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſeemed to have lain down and repoſed herſelf for a conſiderable ſpace; but here began to riſe again with all the ſublimity of <hi>alpine</hi> majeſty.</p>

Both theſe ſtones are mortifed at their lower part into a round one: they are about fifteen feet aſunder; the ſpace between them is incloſed on each ſide with two very large but thin ſemicircular ſtones; ſo that there is left a walk between pillar and pillar of two feet in breadth.

               </head>
               <p>PReſbyterian government in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> took place after the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of popery, as being the form of eccleſiaſtical government moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the genius and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> When <hi>James</hi> VI. ſucceeded to the crown of <hi>England,</hi> it is well known, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his reign and that of his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the family of <hi>Stewart,</hi> deſigns were formed of altering the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our civil government and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our kings more abſolute. The eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0301300200:241"/>
was thought to be one point proper in order to facilitate the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of theſe deſigns. Epiſcopacy was accordingly eſtabliſhed at length, and continued to be the government of the church till the revolution, when ſuch deſigns ſubſiſting no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, preſebyterian government was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to <hi>Scotland.</hi> It was eſtabliſhed by act of parliament in 1690, and was afterwards ſecured by an expreſs article in the treaty of union between the two kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> Among the miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there ſubſiſts a perfect equality; that is, no miniſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an individual, has an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoratative juriſdiction over another. Juriſdiction is competent for them only when they act in a collective body, or as a court of judicature: and then there is a ſubordination of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0301300200:242"/>
one court to another, or inferiour and ſuperiour courts.</p>
               <p>The courts eſtabliſhed by law are the four following, <hi>viz.</hi> Church Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Preſbyteries, Provincial Synods, and above all a National or General Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>A Church Seſſion is compoſed of the Miniſter of the pariſh and certain diſcreet Laymen, who are choſen and ordained for the exerciſe of diſcipline, and are called Elders. The number of theſe Elders varies according to the extent of the pariſh. Two of them, together with the Miniſter, are neceſſary, in order to their holding a legal meeting. The Miniſter always preſides in theſe meetings, and is called Moderator; but has no other authority but what belongs to the <hi>Praeſes</hi> of any other court. The
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0301300200:243"/>
Church Seſſion is appointed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the morals of the pariſhioners, and managing the funds that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for the maintainance of the poor within their bounds. When a perſon is convided of any inſtance of immoral conduct, or of what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his chriſtian profeſſion, the Church Seſſion inflicts ſome eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical cenſure, ſuch as giving him an admonition or rebuke: or if the crime be of a groſs and publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they appoint him to profeſs his repentance in face of the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in order to make ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the publick offence. The higheſt church cenſure is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which is ſeldom inflicted but for contumacy, or for ſome very atrocious crime obſtinately perſiſted in. In former times there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain civil pains and penalties which followed upon a ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0301300200:244"/>
but by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſtatute theſe are happily aboliſhed. The church of <hi>Scotland</hi> addreſſes its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures only to the conſciences of men; and if they cannot by the methods of perſuaſion reclaim offenders, they think it inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of true religion, to have recourſe to compulſive methods, ſuch as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pains and penalties.</p>
               <p>If the perſon thinks himſelf ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved by the Church Seſſion, it is competent for him to ſeek redreſs, by entering an appeal to the Preſbytery, which is the next ſuperiour court. In like manner he may appeal from the Preſbytery to the Provincial Synod, and from the Synod to the Aſſembly, whoſe ſentence is final in all ecele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0301300200:245"/>
A Preſbytery conſiſts of the, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters within a certain diſtrict, and alſo of one ruling Elder from each Church Seſſion within the diſtrict. In ſettling the boundaries of a Preſbytery, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was paid to the ſituation of the country. Where the country is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and champaign, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thirty Miniſters and as many Elders being joined in one Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. In mountainous countries where travelling is more difficult, there are only ſeven or eight Miniſters, in ſome places fewer, in a Preſbytery. The number of Preſbyteries is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to he about ſeventy. Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries review the procedure of Church Seſſions, and judge in references and appeals that are brought before them. They take trials of candidates for the miniſtry: and if upon ſuch trial they had them duly qualified, they licenſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0301300200:246"/>
them to preach, but not to diſpenſe the ſacraments. Such licentiates are called Probationers. It is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain or confer holy orders on ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiates till they be preſented to ſome vacant kirk, and thereby acquire a right to a benefice.</p>
               <p>It is the privilege of Preſbyteries to judge their own members, at leaſt in the firſt inſtance. They may be judged for herefy, that is, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or publiſhing doctrines that are contrary to the publick ſtandard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Act of Parliament and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; or for any inſtance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral conduct, proſecutions for hereſy were formerly more frequent than they are at preſent; but happily a more liberal ſpirit has gained ground among the Clergy of <hi>Scotland.</hi> They think more freely than they did of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0301300200:247"/>
old, and conſequently a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and moderation ſeems to be on the growing hand; ſo that proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for herefy are become more rare, and are generally looked upon as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious. Some ſenſible men among the clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> look upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to certain articles and creeds of human compoſition as a grievance, from which they would willingly be delivered.</p>
               <p>Preſbyteries are more ſevere in their cenſures upon their own members for any inſtance of immoral conduct. If the perſon be convicted, they ſuſpend him from the exerciſe of his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial office for a limited time: but if the crime be of a heinous nature, they depoſe or deprive him of his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical character; ſo that he is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a miniſter of the church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but forfeits his title to his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

and other privileges of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church. However, if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thinks himſelf injured by the ſentence of the Preſbytery, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to appeal to the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synod, within whoſe bounds his Preſbytery lies: and from the Synod he may appeal to the National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Preſbyteries hold their meetings generally every month, except in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote countries, and have a power of adjourning themſelves to whatever time or place within their diſtrict they ſhall think proper. They chuſe their own <hi>Praeſes</hi> or Moderator, who muſt be a Miniſter of their own Preſbytery. The ruling Elders who ſit in Preſbyteries muſt be changed every half-year, or elſe choſen again by their reſpective Church Seſſions.</p>
               <p>Provincial Synods are the next ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour courts to Preſbyteries, and are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0301300200:249"/>
compoſed of the ſeveral Preſbyteries within the province and of a ruling Elder from each Church Seſſion. The ancient dioceſes of the Biſhops are for the moſt part the boundaries of a Synod. Moſt of the Synods in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> meet twice every year, in the months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> and at every meeting they chuſe their Praeſes or Moderator, who muſt be a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of their own number. They review the procedure of Preſbyteries, and judge in appeals, references and complaints, that are brought before them from the inferiour courts. And if a Preſbytery ſhall be found negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in executing the eccleſiaſtical laws againſt any of their members, or any other perſon within their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the Synod can call them to account, and cenſure them as they ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>

The General Aſſembly is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court in eccleſiaſtical matters, and from which there lies no appeal. As they have a power of making Jaws and canons, concerning the diſcipline and government of the church, and the publick ſervice of religion, the King ſends always a commiſſioner to repreſent his royal perſon, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be enacted inconſiſtent with the laws of the ſtate. The perſon who repreſents the King is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſome <hi>Scots</hi> nobleman, whom his Majeſty nominates annually ſome time before the meeting of the aſſembly, and is allowed a ſuitable ſalary for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expence of this honourable office. He is preſent at all the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the aſſembly, and at all their debates and deliberations. After the aſſembly is conſtituted, he preſents his commiſſion and delivers a ſpeech;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0301300200:251"/>
and when they have finiſhed their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which they commonly do in twelve days, he adjourns the aſſembly, and appoints the time and place of their next annual meeting, which is generally at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the month of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aſſembly is compoſed of Miniſters and ruling Elders choſen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from each Preſbytery in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> As the number of Miniſters and Elders in a Preſbytery varies, ſo the number of their repreſentatives muſt hold a proportion to the number of Miniſters and Elders that are in the Preſbytery. The proportion is fixed by laws and regulations for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Each Royal Burgh and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in <hi>Scotland</hi> has likewiſe the privilege of chuſing a ruling Elder to the Aſſembly. All elections muſt at leaſt be made forty days before the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0301300200:252"/>
meeting of the Aſſembly. Their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is either conſtitutive or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial. By the firſt they have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make laws in eccleſiaſtical matters: by the other they judge in references and appeals brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them from the ſubordinate courts, and their ſentences are deciſive and final. One point which greatly employs their attention is the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vacant pariſhes. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of <hi>Scotland</hi> are greatly prejudiced againſt the law of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Hence when a patron pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a candidate to a vacant pariſh, the pariſhioners frequently make great oppoſition to the ſettlement of the preſentee, and appeal from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour courts to the Aſſembly. The Aſſembly now-a-days are not diſpoſed to indulge the pariſhioners in unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable oppoſition to preſentees. On the other hand, they are unwilling to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0301300200:253"/>
ſettle the preſentee in oppoſition to the whole people, who refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his miniſtry, becauſe in this caſe his miniſtrations among them muſt be uſeleſs and without effect. The Aſſembly therefore for the moſt part delay giving ſentence in ſuch caſes, till once they have uſed their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reconcile the pariſhioners to the preſentee. But if their attempts this way prove unſucceſsful, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſettle the preſentee in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the act of parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning patronages. Upon the whole it appears that in the indicatories of the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is an equal repreſentation of the Laity as of the Clergy, which is a great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Laity againſt the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of every Miniſter in a pariſh is to perform religious worſhip,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0301300200:254"/>
and to preach in the language of the country to his congregation every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and likewiſe on other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions appointed by the laws and regulations of the church. The tendency of their preaching is to inſtruct their hearers in the eſſential doctrines of natural and revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and improve theſe inſtructions in order to promote the practice of piety and ſocial virtue. Of old, it was cuſtomary to preach upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted and myſterious points of divinity, but it is now hoped that the generality of the Clergy confine the ſubject of their preaching to what has a tendency to promote virtue and good morals, and to make the people peaceable and uſeful members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>Miniſters likewiſe examine their pariſhioners annually. They go to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0301300200:255"/>
the different towns and <note n="*" place="bottom">I muſt obſerve, that Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> (by birth a <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>) adopted in his dioceſe the zeal of the church of his native country, and its attention to the morals and good conduct of the clergy and their flocks. Not content with the uſual triennial viſitations, he every ſummer, during ſix weeks, made a progre's through ſome diſtrict of his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, preaching and confirming from church to church, ſo that before the return of the triennial viſitation he became well acquainted with the behaviour of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent. He preached every Sunday in ſome church of the city of <hi>Saliſbury;</hi> catechiſed, and inſtrncted its youth for confirmation; was moſt vigilant, and ſtrict in his examination of candidates for holy orders; was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible enemy to pluralities, and of courſe to non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſidents; filled his office with worth and dignity, and by his eſpiſcopal merits, it is to be hoped, may have atoned for the acknowledged blemiſhes in his biographical cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> villages of the pariſh, and in an eaſy and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner converſe with them upon the eſſential doctrines of religion. They make trial of their knowledge by putting queſtions to them on theſe heads. The adult as well as children are catechiſed. They likewiſe viſit their pariſhes and inquire into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of their ſeveral pariſhioners, and admoniſh them for whatever they find blameable in their conduct. At
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0301300200:256"/>
theſe viſitations the Miniſter incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the practice of the relative and ſocial duties, and inſiſts upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the practice of them. And if there happen to be any quarrels among neighbours, the Miniſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by the power of perſuaſion to bring about a reconciliation. But in this part of their conduct, much depends upon the temper, prudence, and diſcretion of Miniſters, who are cloathed with the ſame paſſions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and infirmities, that other men are:</p>
               <p>To this ſenſible account of the Church of <hi>North Britain,</hi> I beg leave to add another, which may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a ſort of ſupplement, and may ſerve to ſling light on ſome points untouched in the preceding: it is the extract from an anſwer to ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I ſent a worthy correſpondent in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0301300200:257"/>
the Highlands, to whom I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for many ſenſible communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>To apprehend well the preſent ſtate of <hi>our</hi> church patronage and mode of ſettlement, we muſt briefly view this matter from the Reformation. At <hi>that</hi> remarkable period the whole temporalities of the church were reſumed by the Crown and Parliament; and ſoon after a new maintenance was ſettled for Miniſters in about 960 pariſhes. The patrons of the old, ſplendid Popiſh livings, ſtill claimed a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage in the new-modelled poor ſtipends for pariſh miniſters. The Lords, or Gentlemen, who got from the Crown, grants of the ſuperiorities and lands of old <hi>abbies,</hi> claimed alſo the patronage of all the churches which were in the gift of thoſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0301300200:258"/>
                     <hi>abbies</hi> during popery. The <hi>King</hi> too claimed the old patronage of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and thoſe of any <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſlic corporations</hi> not granted away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lay-patronages were reckoned always a great grievance by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly from the beginning of the reformation the Church declared againſt lay-patronage and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The eccleſiaſtic laws, of acts of aſſembly, confirmed at laſt by parliament, required, in order to the ſettlement of a Miniſter, ſome concurrence of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, of the gentlemen who had property within the cure, and of the elders of the pariſh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Elders, or <hi>Kirk</hi>-Seſſion, are a number of perſons, who, for their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0301300200:259"/>
wiſdom, piety and knowledge, are elected from the body of the people in every pariſh, and continue for life, <hi>ſeſe bene gerentibus,</hi> to aſſiſt the pariſh Miniſter in ſuppreſſing immoralities and regulating the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the pariſh. Three of theſe men and a Miniſter make a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and form the loweſt of our church courts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus matters continued to the year 1649, when by act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment patronages were <hi>aboliſhed</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and the election or nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miniſters was committed to the <hi>Kirk</hi>-Seſſion or Elders; who, in thoſe days of univerſal ſobriety and outward appearance at leaſt of religion among the Preſbyteriaris, were generally the gentlemen of il beſt condition in the pariſh who were in communion with the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0301300200:260"/>
church. After the <hi>reſtoration</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. along with epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy patronages returned, yet under the old laws; and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates were finally determinate by the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> which even under epiſcopacy in <hi>Scotland</hi> was the ſupreme eccleſiaſtic court. Thus they continued till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, when the Preſbyterian model was reſtored by act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The people choſe their own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and matters continued in this form till the year 1711, when Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s miniſtry intending to defeat the <hi>Hanover</hi> ſucceſſon, took all methods to haraſs ſuch as were firmly attached to it, which the Preſbyterian Gentry and Clergy ever were, both from principle and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. An act therefore was obtained,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0301300200:261"/>
and which is ſtill in force, reſtoring patrons to their power of electing miniſters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>By this act the King is now in poſſeſſion of the patronage of above 500 churches out of 950, having not only the old rights of the crown, but many patronages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the reformation not yet alienated; all the patronages of the 14 <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops, and all the patronages of the Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen forſeited in the years 1715 and 1745. Lords, gentlemen and magiſtrates of burroughs, are the patrons of the remaining churches. A patron muſt preſent a qualified perſon to a charge within ſix months of the laſt incumbent's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval or death, otherwiſe his right falls to the Preſbytery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0301300200:262"/>
                  <q>A Preſbytery conſiſts of ſeveral Miniſters and Elders, All pariſhes are annexed to ſome Preſbytery. The Preſbytery is the ſecond church court, and they reviſe the the acts of the <hi>Kirk</hi>-Seſſion, which is the loweſt. Above the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is the Synod, which is a court conſiſting of ſeveral Preſbyteries. And from all theſe there lies an appeal to the General Aſſembly, which is the ſupreme church court in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This ſupreme court conſiſts of the King repreſented by his Commiſſioner, Miniſters from the different Preſbyteries, and ruling Elders. They meet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> enact laws for the good of the church, finally determine all controverted elections of Miniſters. They can prevent a clergyman's tranſportation from one
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0301300200:263"/>
charge to another. They can find a preſentee qualified or unqualified, and conſequently oblige the patron to preſent another. They can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from the miniſtry, and every intrant into holy orders becomes bound to ſubmit to the deciſions of this court; which, from the days our reformer <hi>John Knox,</hi> has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to itſelf the titles of The VERY VENERABLE and VERY REVEREND ASSEMBLY of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>All the clergymen of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion are upon a par as to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. We can enjoy no pluralities. Non-reſidence is not known. We are bound to a regular diſcharge of the ſeveral duties of our office. The different cures are frequently viſited by the Preſbytery of the bounds; and at theſe viſitations ſtrict: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0301300200:264"/>
is made into the life, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and diligence of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent. And for default in any of theſe, he may be ſuſpended from preaching: or if any groſs immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is proved againſt him, he can be immediately depoſed and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of officiating as a Miniſter of the goſpel. Appeal indeed lies, as I ſaid before, from the deciſion of the inferior to the ſupreme court.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Great care is taken in preparing young men for the miniſtry. After going through a courſe of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy in one of our four Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they muſt attend at leaſt for four years the Divinity-Hall, where they hear the prelections of the profeſſors, and perform the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent exerciſes preſcribed them: they muſt attend the Greek, the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0301300200:265"/>
Hebrew, and Rhetoric claſſes; and before ever they are admitted to tryals for the miniſtry before a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, they muſt lay teſtimonials from the different profeſſors of their mortis, their attendance, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, before them: and if upon tryal they are found unqualified, they are either ſet aſide as unfit for the office, or enjoined to apply to their ſtudies a year or two more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Our livings are in general from 60 to 120l. ſterling. Some few livings are richer, and a few poorer. Every miniſter beſides is entitled to a manſion-houſe, barn and ſtable; to four acres of arable and three of paſturage land. Our livings are exempted from all public duties; as are alſo our perſons from all public ſtatute-works. As ſchools are erected in all our pariſhes, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0301300200:266"/>
that education is cheap, our young generation is beginning to imbibe ſome degree of taſte and liberal ſentiment unknown to their illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate rude forefathers.

                  <hi>KAtharine M'Leod,</hi> daughter to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald M'Leod,</hi> farmer in <hi>Croig,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Kincardine, Roſshire,</hi> an unmarried woman, aged about thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five years, ſixteen years ago contracted a fever, after which ſhe became blind. Her father carried her to ſeveral phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and ſurgeons to cure her blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Their preſcriptions proved of no effect. He carried her alſo to a lady ſkilled in phyſic, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0301300200:268"/>
who, doubtfull whether her blindneſs was occaſioned by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her eye-lids, or a defect in her eyes, found by the uſe of ſome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that the blindneſs was occaſioned by a weakneſs in her eye-lids, which being ſtrengthened ſhe recovered her fight in ſome meaſure, and diſcharged as uſual every kind of work about her father's farm; but tyed a garter tight round her forehead to keep up her eye-lids. In this condition ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for four or five years, enjoying a good ſtate of health, and working as uſual. She contracted another lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering fever, of which ſhe never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered perfectly.</p>
               <p>Some time after her fever her jaws fell, her eye-lids cloſed, and ſhe loſt her appetite. Her parents declare that for the ſpace of a year and three-quarters they could not ſay that any meat or liquid went down her throat.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0301300200:269"/>
throat. Being interrogated on this point, they own'd they very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put ſomething into her mouth. But they concluded that nothing went down her throat, becauſe ſhe had no evacuation; and when they forced open her jaws at one time, and kept them open for ſome time by putting in a ſtick between her teeth, and pulled forward her tongue, and forced ſomething down her throat, me coughed and ſtrained, as if in danger to be choaked. One thing during the time ſhe eat and drank nothing is remarkable, that her jaws were unlocked, and ſhe recovered her ſpeech, and retained it for ſeveral days, without any apparent cauſe for the ſame; ſhe was quite ſenſible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſeveral queſtions of the ſhorter catechiſms; told them that it was to no purpoſe to put any thing into her mouth, for that nothing went down
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0301300200:270"/>
her throat; as alſo that ſometimes ſhe underſtood them when they ſpoke to her. By degrees her jaws thereafter fell, and ſhe loſt her ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Some time before I few her ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome ſuſtenance, whey, water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel, &amp;c. but threw it up, at leaſt for the moſt part, immediately. When they put the ſtick between her teeth, mentioned above, two or three of her teeth were broken. It was at this breach they put in any thing into her mouth. I cauſed them to bring her out of bed, and give her ſomething to drink. They gave her whey. Her neck was contraded, her chin fixed on her breaſt, nor could by any force be pulled back: ſhe put her chin and mouth into the diſh with the whey, and I perceived ſhe ſucked it at the above-mentioned breach as a child would ſuck the breaſt, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0301300200:271"/>
threw it up again, as her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents told me ſhe uſed to do, and ſhe endeavoured with her hand to dry her mouth and chin. Her forehead was contracted and wrinkled; her cheeks full, red, and blooming. Her parents told me that ſhe ſlept a great deal and ſoundly, perſpired ſometimes, and now and then emitted pretty large quantities of blood at her mouth.</p>
               <p>For about two years paſt they have been wont to carry her to the door once every day, and ſhe would ſhew ſigns of uneaſineſs when they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it at the uſual time. Laſt ſum-ſummer, after giving her to drink of the water of the weil of <hi>Strathconnen,</hi> ſhe crawled to the door on her hands and feet without any help.

               <p>ALL the deſcription that can be given of the Parallel Roads, or Terraſſes, is, that the Glen of itſelf is extremely narrow, and the hills on each ſide very high, and generally not rocky. In the face of theſe hills, both ſides of the glen, there are three roads at ſmall diſtances from each other, and directly oppoſite on each ſide. Theſe roads have been mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the compleateſt parts of them, and found to be 26 paces of a man five feet ten inches high. The two higheſt are pretty near each other, about 50 yards, and the loweſt double that diſtance from the neareſt to it. They are carried along the ſides of the glen with the utmoſt regularity,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0301300200:273"/>
nearly as exact as drawn with a line of rule and compaſs.</p>
               <p>Where deep burns or gullies of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter croſs theſe roads, they avoid both the deſcent and aſcent in a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner; ſo that on the ſide where the road enters thoſe hollows, they rather aſcend along the ſlope, and deſcend the oppoſite ſide until they come to the level, without the traveller being ſenſible of aſcent or deſcent. There are other ſmaller glens falling into this <hi>Glen-Roy.</hi> The parallel roads ſurround all theſe ſmaller ones; but where <hi>Glen-Roy</hi> ends in the open country there are not the ſmalleſt veſtiges of them to be ſeen. The length of theſe roads in <hi>Glen-Roy</hi> are about ſeven miles. There are other two glens in that neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood where theſe roads are equally viſible, called <hi>Glen-Gluy</hi> and <hi>Glen-Spean,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0301300200:274"/>
the former running north-weſt and the latter ſouth from <hi>Glen-Roy,</hi> Both theſe roads are much about the ſame length as <hi>Glen-Roy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved that theſe roads are not cauſeway, but levelled out of the earth. There are ſome ſmall rocks, though few, in the courſe of theſe roads. People have examined in what manner they made this paſſage through the rocks, and find no veſtige of roads in the rock; but they begin on each ſide, and keep the regular line as formerly. So far I am indebted to Mr. <hi>Trapaud,</hi> Governor of <hi>Fort Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot learn to what nation the inhabitants of the country attribute theſe roads: I was informed that they were inacceſſible at the eaſt end, open at the weſt, or that neareſt to the ſea,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0301300200:275"/>
and that there were no traces of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or <hi>druidical</hi> remains, in any part, that could lead us to ſuſpect that they were deſigned for oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or religious purpoſes. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people think they were deſigned for the chace, and that theſe terraſſes were made after the ſpots were cleared in lines from wood, in order to tempt the animals into the open paths after they were rouzed, in order that they might come within reach of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who might conceal themſelves in the woods above and below. Ridings for the ſportſmen are ſtill common in all great foreſts in <hi>France,</hi> and other countries on the continent, either that they might purſue the game without interruption of trees, or ſhoot at it in its paſſage.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> p. 114, of his Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, mentions ſuch terraſſes, to the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0301300200:276"/>
number of ſeventeen or eighteen, raiſed one above the other in the moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, for the ſpace of a mile, on the ſide of a hill, in the county of <hi>Tweedale,</hi> near a village called <hi>Romana,</hi> and alſo near two ſmall <hi>Roman</hi> camps. They are from fifteen to twenty feet broad, and appear at four or five miles diſtance not unlike a great am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre. The ſame gentleman alſo has obſerved ſimilar terraſſes near other camps of the ſame nation, from whence he ſuſpects them to be works of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to have been thrown up by their armies for itinerary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments. Such may have been their uſe in thoſe places: but what could have been the object of the contrivers of the terraſſes of <hi>Glen-Roy,</hi> where it is more than probable thoſe conquerors never came, remains a myſtery, except the conjecture above given ſhould prove ſatisfactory.</p>

                  <p>GLoomy indeed is the night and dark, and heavy alſo is my troubled ſoul: around me all is ſilent and ſtill; but deep has forſaken my eyes, and my boſom knoweth not the balm of peace. I mourn for the loſs of the dead—the <hi>young,</hi> the <hi>beauteous,</hi> the <hi>brave,</hi> alas! lies low.—Lovely was thy form, O youth! lovely and fair was thy open ſoul—Why did I know thy worth—Oh! why muſt I now that worth deplore?</p>
                  <p>Length of years ſeemed to be the lot of my Love, yet few and fleeting were his days of joy—Strong he flood as the tree of the vale, but untimely he fell into the ſilent houſe.

               <head>NUMBER V. Of the Columns in <hi>Penrith</hi> Church-Yard.</head>
               <p>SINCE the printing of p. 218, I have been favored with two beautifull drawings of the pillars<note n="*" place="bottom">The leſſer pillar engraven with theſe is by tradition of the country thought to belong to theſe; but Mr. <hi>Fariſh</hi> thinks it is at too great a diſtance from them to admit of that ſuppoſition: its height is ſix feet.</note> in <hi>Penrith</hi> Church-Yard. One was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Fariſh</hi> of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and repreſents them in their preſent ſtate; the other by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Monkhouſe,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Queen's College, Oxford,</hi> which is a view of them before they were muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. The firſt is certainly a moſt authentic repreſentation of them; the laſt varies in many particulars from the form they now appear in: in that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0301300200:287"/>
the columns are drawn entirely ſquare from top to bottom, whereas the lower part of the pillars now extant are rounded. There is no fret-work on the old drawing of theſe columns, but inſtead are two ſmall rude figures of human heads. The thin ſemicircular ſtones are deeply and regularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented on their edges, which appear of an equal thickneſs throughout; whereas the others are very ſharp, or ridged at one extremity, and dilate gradually till they arrive at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable thickneſs at the other. The figures in the old ſketch are of a boar, and perhaps a bear. The upper ends of theſe pillars ſeem faithfully to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what has been deſtroyed, a croſs and a capital.</p>
               <p>How this great variation in the drawings of the ſame columns hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, is not eaſy to ſay; for it does
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0301300200:288"/>
not appear that there ever were any others in the place. Time has obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated the figures of the animals but whether any workman had chiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled the whole ſhafts of the pillars to their preſent form, is, I think, ſcarcely to be conjectured; they bear all the appearance of antiquity. The old drawings are done with much ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and are copied from ſome col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections in the cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> formed by <hi>Hugh Todd,</hi> D. D. Prebendary of <hi>Carliſle</hi> and Vicar of <hi>Penrith,</hi> as materials for the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the dioceſe he belonged to. Notwithſtanding my doubts about the entire fidelity of the old drawing, (which was done about the year 1690) I cauſe it to be engraven as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the other, in hopes that ſome antiquarian of the country will oblige the Publick by clearing up the point.</p>

By Mr. <hi>Monkhouſe</hi>'s permiſſion I annex Doctor <hi>Todd</hi>'s account of theſe antiquities:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>At the north door of the church are erected two large ſtone pillars of a pyramidical form, cruciated towards the top, each of them fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet high, and plac'd at the diſtance of ſeventeen feet from each other. The ſpace between them is ſurrounded with the rude figures of four boars, or wild hogs. What this monument denotes, and for what reaſon it was firſt erected, may be ſomewhat uncertain. The common vulgar report is, That one <hi>Ewen</hi> or <hi>Owen Coeſarius,</hi> a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary perſon, famous in theſe parts for hunting and fighting, about 1400 years ago, whom no hand but the hand of Death could
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0301300200:290"/>
overcome, lyes buried in this place. His ſtature, as the ſtory lays, was prodigious, beyond that of the <hi>Patagons</hi> in <hi>South America,</hi> viz. fifteen feet. That the two pillars denote his height, and the four ough unpoliſh'd ſtones betwixt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent ſo many wild boars which had the honour to be kill'd by this wonderful giant. That there might be, in remote times, in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, men of large gi gantick fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as there are now near the <hi>Magellanic</hi> Streights, and that they might affect <hi>Roman</hi> ſirnames and diſtinctions as the <hi>Americans</hi> about <hi>Darieen</hi> do <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> needs not either be diſcuſſed or denied. But thoſe perſons give the beſt account of the original, nature, and deſign of theſe ſtones, who look upon them as of a much later date, and for a very different intention. That they were
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0301300200:291"/>
erected long after the introduction of chriſtianity at the north (or Death's) door of the church in the form of a croſs, in order to reſt the bodies of the dead upon them, and to pray for their ſouls (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was): And that the four figures of Boars are the cognizance<note n="*" place="bottom">The Bear and ragged-ſtaff was; but I do not recollect that the Boars had any thing to do with the Earls of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick:</hi> But as Boars and Bears are repreſented on the ſtones, it ſeems as if this Mr. <hi>Caeſarius</hi> was a knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errant, who cleared the country of monſters; ſo in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of his exploits theſe figures were engraven. The heads too might have been cut on the columns in memory of ſome petty tyrants of the neighborhood whom he had demoliſhed; for ſuch bloody trophies were in former days very common; witneſs, among the <hi>Welſh,</hi> the <hi>Tripen Sais,</hi> or three Engliſhmen's heads, borne in the arms of many of our families, as a token of the proweſs of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters.</note> of the Earls of <hi>Warwick,</hi> ſome of whom held the ſeigniory of <hi>Penrith</hi> and lived in the caſtle, and might be at the expence of the work.</q>

                  <p>A full-grown Roe weighs 60lb. the hair in ſummer is ſhort, ſmooth, and gloſſy, red at the tips, cinereous beneath. At approach of winter the hair grows very long and hoary, and proves an excellent defence againſt the rigor of the highland air. The rump and underſide of the tail white. The tail very ſhort. Below the firſt joint of the outſide of the hind leg is a long tuft of hair, ſuch as is found on the legs of certain Antelopes. The
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0301300200:294"/>
horns of a Roebuck of the ſecond year are ſtrait, ſlender, and without any branch: in the third become bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furcated: in the fourth, trifurcated, and grow more ſcabrous and ſtronger, in proportion to their longevity. It feeds during ſummer on graſs, and is remarkably fond of the <hi>Rubas Saxatilis,</hi> called in the Highlands on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Roebuck Berry. When the ground is covered with ſnow it feeds on the extreme branches of the pine and juniper. It brings two young at a time. The Fawns are elegantly ſpotted with white. It is extremely difficult to rear them; commonly eight out of ten dying in the attempt. The fleſh of the Roe is by ſome accounted a delicacy: to me it ſeemed very dry. They keep in ſmall families of five or ſix.</p>
