            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ANIMADVERSIONS On a Late PAMPHLET, INTITULED, The New Arian Reprov'd.</head>
            <p>SInce there is a Pamphlet intituled the <hi>New Arian Reprov'd</hi> juſt Publiſh'd, before my Four Volumes come out, I ſhall make a few tho' very ſhort <hi>Animadverſions</hi> thereon. Accordingly, omitting ſeveral injudicious and unfair Paſſages, I Obſerve. (1) That if I, as an Heretick, have written too inſolently, my Antagoniſts as Orthodox, ſhould do better; and thereby ſhew how Athanaſianiſm diſpoſes Men to Chriſtian Meekneſs and Humility more than Arianiſm. Which yet I dare ſay neither this Author, nor Mr. <hi>Mattair,</hi> and leaſt of all Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> have done.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> (2) That my plainneſs and boldneſs in reproving the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Errors remaining in our Church is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted an high <hi>Affront:</hi> Whereas I take it to be the greateſt Kindneſs I can do her. I hope this Author does not ſuppoſe he affronts his Auditors every time he plainly and boldly rebukes them.<note place="margin">p. <hi>8,</hi> &amp;c.</note> (3) I ſhall willingly allow this Author ſeveral whole Years to collect the Tenth part of the Teſtimonies for Orthodoxy in the Two firſt Centuries, that I did in a few Months, for Arianiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor am I at all unwilling to join Iſſue with him in the very ſame proportion for the Third Century alſo; provided he will not produce thoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that ſolely depend on <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> or a few
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0674402100:2"/>
of his followers, without, nay againſt all the other and better Evidence about them. (4) What is here ſaid about Dr. <hi>Grabes Eſſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p <hi>13,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and my <hi>New Theory</hi> I ſhall not repeat, but only deſire the impartial Readers careful peruſal of my <hi>Remarks</hi> on that <hi>Eſſay</hi>; and my <hi>Second Edition</hi> of that <hi>Theory,</hi> before ſuch Reflections have any Weight with him. And I muſt declare how reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoever this Author eſteems it in me, yet that I ever reſolve to own and correct all my miſtakes aſſoon as ever they appear to be ſuch, in all my Writings; and by that means do hope to render thoſe Writings at laſt much more Correct and Undenyable; while the oppoſite vain Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in controverſy Writers of juſtifying every Expreſſion and Conjecture, even after plain Evidence is produc'd to the contrary, hinders their own Improvement, and makes them ſtill propagate Error among Mankind. (5) Sure thoſe Learned Men who mainly recommend the three firſt Centuries, as the Standard of antient Chriſtianity,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p</hi> 17.18.</note> cannot properly include the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> belonging to the fourth.<note place="margin">p. <hi>18,</hi> &amp;c</note> (6) We have here a mighty Stir about this Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and how much 'tis to be prefer'd to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. As if there was no Paſſion, nor Heat, nor worldly Concern, nor Court Management at that Council at all; but the whole was peaceably debated, and all guided by the good Spirit of God. Which if this Author can believe he may do as he pleaſes; while I am ſure the Hiſtories thereof, how partial ſoever on its ſide, give us very different Accounts. And whatever that Council determin'd, we are to believe no more of it than what is proved by the Sacred and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Writers; and what is proved by them we are to believe without regard to its Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0674402100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So that 'tis not of great Weight what this or any other ſuch warm Councils determin'd, to thoſe I mean who with me deſire to follow the proper Authority of Chriſt by his Holy Apoſtles in ſacred matters. Our Author here ſeems to believe all the partial <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts on the ſide of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as firmly as if the whole Chriſtian World had own'd the Truth of them. Whereas one that ſtands ſo ſtifly for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Councils and Synods ought certainly to have ſome regard to the contrary Opinion of at leaſt 3 ſucceſſive Councils in that Caſe (7) After all that is here produc'd there appears little or no debating at the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> at all,<note place="margin">p. <hi>26,</hi> &amp;c.</note> more than what <hi>Euſebius</hi> oblig'd them to; and which might well be all at one time. So that their Creed, as far as I ſee, might be ſign'd the ſame day they met, as <hi>Monfaucon</hi> obſerves: tho' I do not doubt but there was private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, and ſubtile Management before-hand; as there is, I believe, ſtill in all ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If this Author can ſhew that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was here fully debated, and proved to have all the way been deliver'd down from the Apoſtles, he will ſay ſomething; otherwiſe all the political Management and Arts previous to the final Determination will be of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in this Caſe. And I deſire to know if the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did ſo unanimouſly, and upon ſuch undenyable Authority eſtabliſh this, as the undoubted perpetual Faith of Chriſtians: How a more numerous Council, that of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>; to ſay nothing of thoſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> could in ten years time quite loſe the Notion, and ſettle the Church upon a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without it: as if they never knew of any ſuch antient Tradition or Doctrine among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0674402100:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at all? This is certainly a Queſtion to be well weighed by thoſe that depend ſo intirely on the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> (8) I have fully, in more places than one,<note place="margin">p <hi>31,</hi> &amp;c</note> declar'd how far I am an Arian. Nor can any one doubt from all I have ſaid that in my uncertain philoſophick Conjectures, I incline more to the Followers of <hi>Arius</hi> himſelf than of <hi>Athanaſius</hi>: but in my certain Faith I keep ſtrictly to the original Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Expreſſions alone; with an utter Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of all Novel and raſh <hi>Arian,</hi> as well as <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Additions and Language in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as I think 'tis the plain Duty of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to do. I take <hi>Eunomius</hi> to have been a much more Learned, Judicious, Wiſe, and Good Man, than <hi>Arius</hi>: and ſo I may well ſpeak with great Reſpect of the one, while I have no great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for the other; altho' Cuſtom may call <hi>Eunomius</hi> a moſt compleat Arian, in a general Acceptation, as diſtinguiſh'd from other Parties then contending in the Church. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetick of this <hi>Eunomius,</hi> which I am going to publiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> certainly ſhew what a great Man he was. I have read nothing of the Orthodox in this Century, for Piety, Judgment, and cloſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the antient Faith and Language of Chriſtians to be compar'd to it.<note place="margin">p. <hi>36,</hi> &amp;c.</note> (9) To prove that the <hi>Athanaſians</hi> did not own that <hi>Solomon Prov.</hi> 8.22. ſaid that God <hi>Created</hi> our Saviour, while they forbad that Expreſſion under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Hereſy, this Author ſays that is not the meaning of the Hebrew Word in this place. If this be Logick I own I have none. For my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument depended not on the real Senſe of the Hebrew, but on the confeſſed Language and Senſe of the Greek, which the Church us'd; and I think none call'd in queſtion till after the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0674402100:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> So that all that is here ſaid is intirely remote from the point. For the Antient Teſtimonies they are ſoon to be laid before the Reader, and he is himſelf to judge whether they are only ſome <hi>unguarded Expreſſions,</hi> or whether they do not contain the direct and plain <hi>Doctrine of the two firſt Centuries of Chriſtianity.</hi> I believe our Author will find it hard, to ſet them in a <hi>clear irreſiſtible Light,</hi> on the ſide of Orthodoxy, as he here ſpeaks. (10) As to the Conſtitutions,<note place="margin">p. <hi>39,</hi> &amp;c.</note> with their Interpolations, and Doxologies, I refer this Author to my Eſſay upon them, which is now to be Publiſh'd; and am not afraid ſtill to aſſert, notwithſtanding all this Authors Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, that they are <hi>the moſt Sacred of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Books of the New Teſtament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. <hi>43,</hi> &amp;c.</note> (11) To prove that my Lord of <hi>Worceſter</hi> is Angry with me for tranſpoſing ſome Parts of the former Thirteen Chapters of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> he alledges that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip differs from me about the Day of Chriſts Death, and ſome Circumſtances belonging to his Paſſion in the Twenty Sixth and Twenty Seventh Chapters. If our Reflecter goes on in this way of reaſoning he will ſoon become Unanſwerable.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 49, 50</note> I believe Monſieur <hi>Toinards</hi> is an excellent Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by what ſmall ſight I have had of it; but ſure I may venture to differ from him, or omit his large Book in a ſmall Catalogue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Imputation of Ignorance; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially while there were ſo few Copies of it in <hi>England</hi> when I wrote that Catalogue.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51</note> As to the Eighty Fifth Canon I did certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its being Apoſtolical long before I found the reſt to be ſo: Let this Author ſay what he pleaſes.

ſo common in all ſuch Caſes, he rather intimates he will make it good here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, than has yet done it. So that all our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Flouriſhes here are upon very little Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.<note place="margin">p. <hi>54,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Nor does he ſeem to differ much from me at laſt about the meaning of the Scripture Phraſes uſually interpreted of a proper Eternity; notwithſtanding his ſhew of ſtill confuting and reproaching me thereupon. And for the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>Ignatius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 56</note> ſure the Quotations in thoſe Fathers he means are of <hi>later Writers,</hi> or <hi>Writers</hi> much <hi>later</hi> than <hi>Ignatius</hi>; and in no other Senſe did I uſe thoſe Words; For I did not then, nor do yet remember of what particular Antiquity the Citations he refers to were ſuppos'd to be. (12) The <hi>Preface</hi> to the Arabick Doctrine is that which I alone Publiſh'd, and mainly depended on,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 57</note> as I ſtill do; and till its Authority be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, which I believe cannot be done, it certainly goes a great way to <hi>put an End to the Diſpute</hi> about the Conſtitutions <hi>for ever.</hi> (13) This Author is to prove Mr. <hi>Emlin</hi> once a <hi>Socinian,</hi> even notwithſtanding ſeveral Paſſages in his Writings intirely diſagree thereto.<note place="margin">p. <hi>57,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Now ſure this Author might have ſuppos'd that I knew an Intimate Friends Opinions both former and later better than a meer Stranger could do: And that I would not notoriouſly falſify in ſuch a plain caſe. And I ſtill aſſure him I ſpake the direct Truth. And that he may learn to examin better before he <hi>Writes</hi> any more about Mr. <hi>Emlin</hi>'s Opinions, I ſhall tell him what I know of them, both from his Writings, and from his own Month, <hi>viz.</hi> that when formerly he examin'd that matter, he found that our Saviour Pre-exiſted, and moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> his own Words in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges here cited do ſhew, which are theſe. <hi>So that it ſhould ſeem, that Nature which did pre-exiſt did not poſſeſs the ſupreme Will.—Tho' he be allow'd to be a Man, approved of God by Signs and mighty Wonders,</hi>

But how a Paſſage from Biſhop <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> who ſeems to have known no more than our Author, what Mr. <hi>Emlins</hi> Opinions were, is a proof that he was a Socinian, I by no means under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.<note place="margin">
