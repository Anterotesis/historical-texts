            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT Of the French Editors.</head>
            <p>THE name and writings of Mr. Hume
have been long ſince well known
throughout Europe. At the ſame time, his
perſonal acquaintance have remarked, in
the candour and ſimplicity of his manners,
that impartiality and ingenuouſneſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
which diſtinguiſhes his character,
and is ſufficiently indicated in his writings.</p>
            <p>He hath exerted thoſe great talents he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from nature, and the acquiſitions he
made by ſtudy, in the ſearch of truth, and
promoting the good of mankind: never
waſting his time, or ſacrificing his repoſe,
in literary or perſonal diſputes. He hath
ſeen his writings frequently cenſured with
bitterneſs, by fanaticiſm, ignorance, and the
ſpirit of party, without ever giving an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to his adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Even thoſe who have attacked his works
with the greateſt violence, have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
his perſonal character. His love of
peace is ſo well known, that the criticiſms
written againſt his pieces, have been often
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0564000300:3"/>
brought him by their reſpective authors, for
him to reviſe and correct them. At one time,
in particular, a performance of this kind was
ſhewn to him; in which he had been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a very rude and even injurious manner;
on remarking which to the author, the latter
ſtruck out the exceptionable paſſages; bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and wondering at the force of that <hi>polemic
ſpirit</hi> which had carried him imperceptibly
away beyond the bounds of truth and decency.</p>
            <p>It was with great reluctance that a man,
poſſeſſed of ſuch pacific diſpoſitions, could
be brought to conſent to the publication of
the following piece. He was very ſenſible
that the quarrels among men of letters are
a ſcandal to philoſophy; nor was any perſon
in the world leſs formed for giving occaſion
to a ſcandal, ſo conſolatory to blockheads.
But the circumſtances were ſuch as to draw
him into it, in ſpite of his inclinations.</p>
            <p>All the world knows that Mr. Rouſſeau,
proſcribed in almoſt every country where he
reſided, determined at length to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in England; and that Mr. Hume, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by his ſituation, and his misfortunes,
undertook to bring him over, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for him a peaceful, ſafe, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
alylum. But very few perſons are
privy to the zeal, activity, and even deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
with which Mr. Hume conferred this
act of benevolence; what an affectionate
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0564000300:4"/>
attachment he had contracted for this new
friend, which humanity had given him;
with what addreſs he endeavoured to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
his deſires, without offending his
pride; in ſhort, with what addreſs he ſtrove
to juſtify, in the eyes of others, the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
of Mr. Rouſſeau, and to defend his
character againſt thoſe who were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to think ſo favourably of him as he
did himſelf.</p>
            <p>Even at the time when Mr. Hume was
employed in doing Mr. Rouſſeau the moſt
eſſential ſervice, he received from him the
moſt inſolent and abuſive letter. The more
ſuch a ſtroke was unexpected, the more
it was cruel and affecting. Mr. Hume wrote
an account of this extraordinary adventure
to his friends at Paris; and expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his letters with all that indignation
which ſo ſtrange a proceeding muſt excite.
He thought himſelf under no obligation to
keep terms with a man, who, after having
received from him the moſt certain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
marks of friendſhip, could reproach
him, without any reaſon, as falſe, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and as the moſt wicked of mankind.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the diſpute between
theſe two celebrated perſonages did not fail
to make a noiſe. The complaints of Mr.
Hume ſoon came to the knowlege of the
public; which at firſt hardly believed it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0564000300:5"/>
that Mr. Rouſſeau could be guilty of
that exceſſive ingratitude laid to his charge.
Even Mr. Hume's friends were fearful, leſt,
in the firſt effuſions of ſenſibility, he was
not carried too far, and had not miſtaken
for wilful crimes of the heart, the vagaries
of the imagination, or the deceptions of the
underſtanding. He judged it neceſſary,
therefore, to explain the affair, by writing
a preciſe narrative of all that paſſed between
him and Mr. Rouſſeau, from their firſt
connection to their rupture. This narrative
he ſent to his friends; ſome of whom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
him to print it; alledging, that as Mr.
Rouſſeau's accuſations were become public,
the proofs of his juſtification ought to be ſo
too. Mr. Hume did not give into theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
chooſing rather to run the riſk of
being unjuſtly cenſured, than to reſolve on
making himſelf a public party in an affair,
ſo contrary to his diſpoſition and character.
A new incident, however, at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his reluctance. Mr. Rouſſeau had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
a letter to a bookſeller at Paris; in
which he directly accuſes Mr. Hume of
having entered into a league with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to betray and defame him; and in
which he boldly defies Mr. Hume to print
the papers he had in his hands. This letter
was communicated to ſeveral perſons in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
was tranſlated into Engliſh, and the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0564000300:6"/>
tranſlation printed in the public papers in
London. An accuſation and defiance ſo
very public could not be ſuffered to paſs
without reply; while any long ſilence on
the part of Mr. Hume might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
little in his favour.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the news of this diſpute had
ſpread itſelf over Europe, and the opinions
entertained of it were various. It had
doubtleſs been much happier, if the whole
affair had been buried in oblivion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a profound ſecret: but as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to prevent the public intereſting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the controverſy, it became neceſſary
at leaſt that the truth of the matter ſhould
be known. Mr. Hume's friends unitedly
repreſented to him all theſe reaſons; the
force of which he was at length convinced
of; and ſeeing the neceſſity, conſented,
though with reluctance, to the printing of
his memorial.</p>
            <p>The narrative, and notes, are tranſlated
from the Engliſh<note n="*" place="bottom">And are now re-tranſlated, for the moſt part, from the French; the French editors having taken ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, not without Mr. Hume's conſent, with the Engliſh original. <bibl>

He has taken the liberty alſo to add a note or two, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome particular circumſtances which had come to his knowlege.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0564000300:7"/>
This pamphlet contains many ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of ſingularity, that will appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
enough to thoſe who will give
themſelves the trouble to peruſe it. Thoſe
who do not chuſe to take that trouble, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
may poſſibly do better; as its contents
are of little importance, except to thoſe who
are immediately intereſted.</p>
            <p>On the whole, Mr. Hume, in offering to
the public the genuine pieces of his trial,
has authoriſed us to declare, that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
take up the pen again on the ſubject.
Mr. Rouſſeau indeed may return to the
charge; he may produce ſuppoſitions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions,
inferences, and new declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
he may create and realize new phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
and envelop them in the clouds of his
rhetoric; he will meet with no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
The facts are all laid before the
public<note n="*" place="bottom">The original letters of both parties will be lodged in the Britiſh Muſeum; on account of the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned defiance of Mr. Rouſſeau, and his ſubſequent inſinuation that if they ſhould be publiſhed, they would be falſified.</note>: and Mr. Hume ſubmits his cauſe
to the determination of every man of ſenſe
and probity.</p>

            <p>MY connection with Mr. Rouſſeau be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in 1762, when the Parliament
of Paris had iſſued an arret for apprehending
him, on account of his <hi>Emilius.</hi> I was at
that time at Edinburgh. A perſon of great
worth wrote to me from Paris, that Mr.
Rouſſeau intended to ſeek an aſylum in
England, and deſired I would do him all the
good offices in my power. As I conceived
Mr. Rouſſeau had actually put his deſign in
execution, I wrote to ſeveral of my friends
in London, recommending this celebrated
exile to their favour. I wrote alſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to Mr. Rouſſeau himſelf; aſſuring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0564000300:9"/>
him of my deſire to oblige, and readineſs to
ſerve him. At the ſame time, I invited him
to come to Edinburgh, if the ſituation would
be agreeable, and offered him a retreat in
my own houſe, ſo long as he ſhould pleaſe
to partake of it. There needed no other
motive to excite me to this act of humanity,
than the idea given me of Mr. Rouſſeau's
perſonal character, by the friend who had
recommended him, his well-known genius
and abilities, and above all, his misfortunes;
the very cauſe of which was an additional
reaſon to intereſt me in his favour. The
following is the anſwer I received.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I DID not receive till lately, and at this
place, the letter you did me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to direct to me at London, the 2d of
July laſt, on the ſuppoſition that I was then
arrived at that capital. I ſhould doubtleſs
have made choice of a retreat in your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and as near as poſſible to yourſelf, if I
had foreſeen what a reception I was to meet
with in my own. No other nation could
claim a preference to England. And this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0564000300:10"/>
prepoſſeſſion, for which I have dearly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
was at that time too natural not to
be very excuſable; but to my great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as that of the public, I have met
with nothing but affronts and inſults, where
I hoped to have found conſolation at leaſt, if
not gratitude. How many reaſons have I not
to regret the want of that aſylum and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
hoſpitality I ſhould have found with
you! My misfortunes indeed have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſeemed to lead me in a manner that
way. The protection and kindneſs of my
Lord Marſhal, your worthy and illuſtrious
countryman, hath brought Scotland home
to me, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, in the
midſt of Switzerland; he hath made you
ſo often bear a part in our converſation,
hath brought me ſo well acquainted with
your virtues, which I before was only with
your talents, that he inſpired me with the
moſt tender friendſhip for you, and the moſt
ardent deſire of obtaining yours, before I
even knew you were diſpoſed to grant it.
Judge then of the pleaſure I ſeel, at finding
this inclination reciprocal. No, Sir, I
ſhould pay your merit but half its due, if
it were the ſubject only of my admiration.
Your great impartiallty, together with your
amazing penetration and genius, would lift
you far above the reſt of mankind, if you
were leſs attached to them by the goodneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0564000300:11"/>
of your heart. My Lord Marſhal, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
me that the amiableneſs of your
diſpoſition was ſtill greater than the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of your genius, rendered a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with you every day more deſirable,
and cheriſhed in me thoſe wiſhes which
he inſpired, of ending my days near you.
Oh, Sir, that a better ſtate of health, and
more convenient circumſtances, would but
enable me to take ſuch a journey in the
manner I could like! Could I but hope to
ſee you and my Lord Marſhal one day ſettled
in your own country; which ſhould for ever
after be mine; I ſhould be thankful, in ſuch
a ſociety, for the very misfortunes that led
me into it, and ſhould account the day of
its commencement as the firſt of my life.
Would to Heaven I might live to ſee that
happy day, though now more to be deſired
than expected! With what tranſports ſhould
I not exclaim, on ſetting foot in that happy
country which gave birth to David Hume
and the Lord Marſhal of Scotland!</p>

            <p>This letter is not publiſhed from a motive
of vanity; as will be ſeen preſently, when
I give the reader a recantation of all the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
it contains; but only to compleat the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0564000300:12"/>
courſe of our correſpondence, and to ſhew
that I have been long ſince diſpoſed to Mr.
Rouſſeau's ſervice.</p>
            <p>From this time our correſpondence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ceaſed, till about the middle of laſt
autumn (1765;) when it was renewed by
the following accident. A certain lady of
Mr. Rouſſeau's acquaintance, being on a
journey to one of the French provinces,
bordering on Switzerland, had taken that
opportunity of paying a viſit to our ſolitary
philoſopher, in his retreat at Motiers-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
To this lady he complained, that his
ſituation in Newſchatel was become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
diſagreeable, as well on account of
the ſuperſtition of the people, as the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the clergy; and that he was afraid
he ſhould ſhortly be under the neceſſity of
ſeeking an aſylum elſewhere; in which caſe,
England appeared to him, from the nature
of its laws and government, to be the only
place to which he could retire with perfect
ſecurity; adding, that my Lord Marſhal,
his former protector, had adviſed him to
put himſelf under my protection (that was
the term he was pleaſed to make uſe of)
and that he would accordingly addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to me, if he thought it would not be
giving me too much trouble.</p>
            <p>I was at that time charged with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of England at the court of France;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0564000300:13"/>
but as I had the proſpect of ſoon returning
to London, I could not reject a propoſal
made to me under ſuch circumſtances, by a
man ſo celebrated for his genius and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
As ſoon as I was thus informed,
therefore, of the ſituation and intentions of
Mr. Rouſſeau, I wrote to him, making him
an offer of my ſervices; to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the following anſwer.</p>

                  <p>THE remembrance of your former

It is to deſire you will be ſo good,

Amidſt the torrent of misfortunes that over-whelm

            <p>It is with reluctance I ſay it, but I am
compelled to it; I now know of a certainty
that this affectation of extreme poverty and
diſtreſs was a mere pretence, a petty kind of
impoſture which Mr. Rouſſeau ſucceſsfully
employed to excite the compaſſion of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0564000300:16"/>
public; but I was then very far from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
any ſuch artifice. I muſt own, I
felt on this occaſion an emotion of pity,
mixed with indignation, to think a man of
letters of ſuch eminent merit, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
in ſpite of the ſimplicity of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living, to ſuch extreme indigence;
and that this unhappy ſtate ſhould be rendered
more intolerable by ſickneſs, by the approach
of old age, and the implacable rage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.
I knew that many perſons impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the wretchedneſs of Mr. Rouſſeau to
his exceſſive pride, which induced him to
refuſe the aſſiſtance of his friend; but I
thought this fault, if it were a fault, was a
very reſpectable one. Too many men of
letters have debated their character in ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo low as to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of wealth or power, unworthy of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
them protection; and I conceived
that a noble pride, even though carried to
exceſs, merited ſome indulgence in a man of
genius, who, borne up by a ſenſe of his own
ſuperiority and a love of independence, ſhould
have braved the ſtorms of fortune and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of mankind. I propoſed, therefore,
to ſerve Mr. Rouſſeau in his own way. I
deſired Mr. Clairaut, accordingly, to give
me his letter; which I ſhewed to ſeveral of
Mr. Rouſſeau's friends and patrons in Paris.
At the ſame time, I propoſed to them a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0564000300:17"/>
ſcheme, by which he might be relieved,
without ſuſpecting any thing of the matter.
This was to engage the bookſeller, who was
to publiſh his <hi>dictionary,</hi> to give Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau
a greater ſum for the copy than he had
offered, and to indemnify him by paying him
the difference. But this project, which
could not be executed without the aſſiſtance
of Mr. Clairaut, fell to the ground, at the
unexpected deceaſe of that learned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable
academician.</p>
            <p>Retaining, however, ſtill the ſame idea
of Mr. Rouſſeau's exceſſive poverty, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
retained the ſame inclination to
oblige him; and when I was informed of
his intention to go to England under my
conduct, I formed a ſcheme much of the
ſame kind with that I could not execute at
Paris. I wrote immediately to my friend,
Mr. John Stewart, of Buckingham ſtreet,
that I had an affair to communicate to him
of ſo ſecret and delicate a nature, that I
ſhould not venture even to commit it to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but that he might learn the particulars
of Mr. Elliot (now Sir Gilbert Elliot) who
would ſoon return from Paris to London.
The plan was this, and was really communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Mr. Elliot ſome time after to Mr.
Stewart; who was at the ſame time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
to the greateſt ſecrecy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0564000300:18"/>
Mr. Stewart was to look out for ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
diſcreet farmer in his neighbourhood in
the country, who might be willing to lodge
and board Mr. Rouſſeau and his Gouvern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante,
in a very decent and plentiful manner,
at a penſion which Mr. Stewart might ſettle
at fifty or ſixty pounds a year; the farmer
engaging to keep ſuch agreement a profound
ſecret, and to receive from Mr. Rouſſeau
only twenty or twenty-five pounds a year; I
engaging to ſupply the difference.</p>
            <p>It was not long beſore Mr. Stewart wrote
me word he had found a ſituation which he
conceived might be agreeable; on which I
deſired he would get the apartment furniſhed
in a proper and convenient manner at my
expence. But this ſcheme, in which there
could not poſſibly enter any motive of vanity
on my part, ſecrecy being a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of its execution, did not take place;
other deſigns preſenting themſelves more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and agreeable. The ſact, however,
is well known both to Mr. Stewart and Sir
Gilbert Elliot.</p>
            <p>It will not be improper here to mention
another plan concerted with the ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I had accompanied Mr. Rouſſeau
into a very pleaſant part of the county of
Surry, where he ſpent two days at Colonel
Webb's; Mr. Rouſſeau ſeeming to me highly
delighted with the natural and ſolitary beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0564000300:19"/>
of the place. Through the means of
Mr. Stewart, therefore, I entered into treaty
with Colonel Webb for the purchaſing the
houſe, with a little eſtate adjoining, in
order to make a ſettlement for Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau.
If after what has paſſed, Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau's
teſtimony be of any validity, I may
appeal to himſelf for the truth of what
I advance. But be this as it will, theſe facts
are well known to Mr. Stewart, to General
Clarke, and in part to Colonel Webb.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in my narrative. Mr.
Rouſſeau came to Paris, provided with a
paſſport, which his friends had obtained for
him. I conducted him to England. For
upwards of two months after our arrival, I
employed myſelf, and my friends, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out for ſome agreeable ſituation for him.
We gave way to all his caprices; excuſed
all his ſingularities; indulged him in all his
humours; in ſhort, neither time nor trouble
was ſpared to procure him what he deſired<note n="‖" place="bottom">It is probably to this exceſſive and ill-judged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance Mr. H. may in a great degree impute the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable conſequences that have followed. There is no end in indulging caprice, nor any prudence in doing it, when it is known to be ſuch. It may be thought hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to indulge the weak of body or mind, the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude of age and imbecility of childhood; but even here it too often proves cruelty to the very parties indulged. How much more inexcuſable therefore is it to cheriſh the abſurdities of whim and ſingularity in men of genius and abilities? How is it poſſible to make a man eaſy or happy in a world, to whoſe cuſtoms and maxims he is determined to run retrograde! No. Capricious men, like froward children, ſhould be left to kick againſt the pricks, and vent their ſpleen unnoticed. To humour, is only to ſpoil them. <bibl>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0564000300:20"/>
and, notwithſtanding he rejected ſeveral of
the projects which I had laid out for him,
yet I thought myſelf ſufficiently recompenſed
for my trouble, by the gratitude and even
affection with which he appeared to repay
my ſolicitude.</p>
            <p>At length his preſent ſettlement was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and approved. Mr. Davenport, a
gentleman of family, fortune, and worth,
offered him his houſe at Wooton, in the
county of Derby, where he himſelf ſeldom
reſides, and at which Mr. Rouſſeau and his
houſekeeper are boarded, at a very moderate
expence.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Rouſſeau arrived at Wooton,
he wrote me the following letter.</p>

                  <p>YOU ſee already, my dear patron, by
the date of my letter, that I am ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the place of my deſtination; but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0564000300:21"/>
you cannot ſee all the charms which I find
in it; to do this, you ſhould be acquainted
with the ſituation, and be able to read my
heart. You ought, however, to read at
leaſt thoſe of my ſentiments with reſpect to
you, and which you have ſo well deſerved.
If I live in this agreeable aſylum as happy as
I hope to do, one of the greateſt pleaſures
of my life will be, to reflect that I owe it
to you. To make another happy, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be happy one's ſelf. May you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
find in yourſelf the reward of all you
have done for me! Had I been alone, I
might perhaps have met with hoſpitality,
but I ſhould have never reliſhed it ſo highly
as I now do, in owing it to your friendſhip.
Retain ſtill that friendſhip for me, my dear
patron; love me for my ſake, who am ſo
much indebted to you; love me for your
own, for the good you have done me. I am
ſenſible, of the full value of your ſincere
friendſhip; it is the object of my ardent
wiſhes; I am ready to repay it with all
mine, and feel ſomething in my heart which
may one day convince you that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its value. As, for the reaſons agreed on
between us, I ſhall receive nothing by the
poſt, you will be pleaſed, when you have
the goodneſs to write to me, to ſend your
letters to Mr. Davenport. The affair of
the carriage is not yet adjuſted, becauſe I

know I was impoſed on: it is a trifling fault,
however, which may be only the effect of
an obliging vanity, unleſs it ſhould happen
to be repeated. If you were concerned in
it, I would adviſe you to give up, once for
all, theſe little impoſitions, which cannot
proceed from any good motive, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into ſnares for ſimplicity. I embrace

                  <p>YOU will ſee, my dear patron, by
the letter Mr. Davenport will have
tranſmitted you, how agreeably I find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſituated in this place. I might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
be more at my eaſe if I were leſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed;
but the ſolicitude of ſo police an hoſt
as mine is too obliging to give offence;
and as there is nothing in life without its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
that of being too good, is one
of thoſe which is the moſt tolerable. I find
a much greater inconvenience in not being
able to make the ſervants underſtand me,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0564000300:23"/>
and particularly in my not underſtanding
them. Luckily Mrs. le Vaſſeur ſerves me
as interpreter, and her fingers ſpeak better
than my tongue. There is one advantage
however attending my ignorance, which is a
kind of compenſation; it ſerves to tire
and keep at a diſtance impertinent viſitors.
The miniſter of the pariſh came to ſee me
yeſterday, who, finding that I ſpoke to him
only in French, would not ſpeak to me in
Engliſh, ſo that our interview was almoſt a
ſilent one. I have taken a great fancy to
this expedient, and ſhall make uſe of it with
all my neighbours, if I have any. Nay,
ſhould I even learn to ſpeak Engliſh, I would
converſe with them only in French, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if I were ſo happy as to find they did
not underſtand a word of that language.
An artifice this, much of the ſame kind with
that which the Negroes pretend is practiſed by
the monkeys, who, they ſay, are capable of
ſpeech, but cannot be prevailed upon to
talk, leſt they ſhould be ſet to work.</p>
                  <p>It is not true in any ſenſe, that I agreed to
accept of a model from Mr. Goſſet as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
On the contrary, I aſked him the
price, which he told me was a guinea and
half, adding that he intended to preſent me
with it; an offer I did not accept. I deſire
you therefore to pay him for it, and Mr.
Davenport will be ſo good as repay you the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0564000300:24"/>
money. And if Mr. Goſſet does not conſent
to be paid for it, it muſt be returned to him,
and purchaſed by ſome other hand. It is
deſigned for Mr. du Peyrou, who deſired
long ſince to have my portrait, and cauſed
one to be painted in miniature, which is not
at all like me. You were more fortunate in
this reſpect than he, but I am ſorry that, by
your aſſiduity to ſerve me, you deprived me of
the pleaſure of diſcharging the ſame friendly
obligation with regard to yourſelf. Be ſo good,
my dear patron, as to order the model to be
ſent to Meſſrs. Guinand and Hankey, Little
St. Helen's, Biſhopſgate-ſtreet, in order to
be tranſmitted to Mr. du Peyrou by the firſt
ſafe conveyance. It hath been a froſt ever
ſince I have been here: the ſnow falls daily;
and the wind is cutting and ſevere: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all which, I had rather lodge in the
hollow trunk of an old tree, in this country,
than in the moſt ſuperb apartment in London.
Good day, my dear patron. I embrace you

            <p>Mr. Rouſſeau and I having agreed not to
lay each other under any reſtraint by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
correſpondence, the only ſubject of
our future letters was the obtaining a penſion
for him from the king of England; which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0564000300:25"/>
was then in agitation; and of which affair
the following is a conciſe and faithful rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As we were converſing together one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at Calais, where we were detained by
contrary winds, I aſked Mr. Rouſſeau if he
would not accept of a penſion from the king
of England, in caſe his majeſty ſhould be
pleaſed to grant him one. To this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
it was a matter of ſome difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on; but that he ſhould be entirely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the advice of my Lord Marſhall.
Encouraged by this anſwer, I no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in London, than I addreſſed myſelf to
his majeſty's miniſters, and particularly to
General Conway, Secretary of State, and
General Graeme, Secretary and Chamberlain
to the queen. Application was accordingly
made to their majeſties, who with their uſual
goodneſs conſented, on condition only that
the affair ſhould not be made publick. Mr.
Rouſſeau and I both wrote to my Lord
Marſhall; and Mr. Rouſſeau expreſsly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in his letter, that the circumſtance of
the affair's being to be kept ſecret, was very
agreeable to him. The conſent of my Lord
Marſhall arrived, as may readily be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
ſoon after which Mr. Rouſſeau ſet out
for Wooton; while the buſineſs remained
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0564000300:26"/>
ſome time in ſuſpenſe, on account of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
of General Conway.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I began to be afraid,
from what I had obſerved of Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau's
diſpoſition and character, that his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reſtleſſneſs of mind would prevent
his enjoyment of that repoſe, to which
the hoſpitality and ſecurity he found in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
invited him. I ſaw, with infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
that he was born for ſtorms and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and that the diſguſt which might
ſucceed the peaceful enjoyment of ſolitude
and tranquillity, would ſoon render him a
burthen to himſelf and every body about
him<note n="*" place="bottom">In forming the opinion of Mr. Rouſſeau's diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Mr. Hume was by no means ſingular: the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing features of Mr. Rouſſeau's extraordinary character having been ſtrongly marked in the criticiſms on his ſeveral writings, in the Monthly Review, particularly in the account of his Letters from the mountains, in the appendix to the 31ſt vol. of that work; where this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated genius is deſcribed, merely from the general tenour of his writings and the outlines of his publick conduct, to be exactly ſuch a kind of perſon as Mr. Hume hath diſcovered him from intimate and perſonal acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <bibl>

his reſidence, and was conſtantly employed
in doing him good offices, I did not expect
that I myſelf ſhould be the victim of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

            <p>This letter was written by Mr. Horace
Walpole, about three weeks before I left
Paris; but though we lodged in the ſame
hotel, and were often together, Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole,

this piece of pleaſantry till after my

Europe, and was in every body's hands
when I ſaw it, for the firſt time, in London.</p>
            <p>I believe every one will allow, who knows

ſuch a piece of raillery could not, even by

I was ſorry to ſee Mr. Rouſſeau diſplay
ſuch an exceſs of ſenſibility, on account of
ſo ſimple and unavoidable an incident, as
the publication of this pretended letter from
the King of Pruſſia. But I ſhould have
accuſed myſelf of a moſt black and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent
diſpoſition, if I had imagined Mr.
Rouſſeau could have ſuſpected me to have
been the editor of it; or that he had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
directed his reſentment againſt me.
He now informs me, however, that this
was really the caſe. Juſt eight days before,
I had received a letter, written in the moſt
amicable terms imaginable<note n="*" place="bottom">That of the 29th of March.</note>. I am, ſurely,
the laſt man in the world, who, in common
ſenſe ought to be ſuſpected; yet, without
even the pretence of the ſmalleſt proof or
probability, I am, of a ſudden, the firſt
man not only ſuſpected, but certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to be the publiſher; I am, without
further enquiry or explication, intentionally
inſulted in a public paper; I am, from the
deareſt friend, converted into a treacherous
and malignant enemy; and all my preſent
and paſt ſervices are at one ſtroke very art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cancelled. Were it not ridiculous to
employ reaſoning on ſuch a ſubject, and
with ſuch a man, I might aſk Mr. Rouſſeau,
<q rend="inline">"Why I am ſuppoſed to have any malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0564000300:31"/>
againſt him?"</q> My actions, in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
inſtances, had ſufficiently demonſtrated
the contrary; and it is not uſual for favours
conferred to beget ill-will in the perſon who
confers them. But ſuppoſing I had ſecretly
entertained an animoſity towards him, would
I run the riſque of a diſcovery, by ſo ſilly a
vengeance, and by ſending this piece to the
preſs, when I knew, from the uſual avidity
of the news-writers to find articles of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that it muſt neceſſarily in a few
days be laid hold of?</p>
            <p>But not imagining that I was the object
of ſo black and ridiculous a ſuſpicion, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
my uſual train, by ſerving my friend
in the leaſt doubtful manner. I renewed my
applications to General Conway, as ſoon as
the ſtate of that gentleman's health permitted
it: the General applies again to his Majeſty:
his Majeſty's conſent is renewed: the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AFFECTED with a moſt lively
ſenſe of the favour his Majeſty hath
honoured me with, and with that of your
goodneſs, which procured it me; it affords
me the moſt pleaſing ſenſation to reflect,
that the beſt of Kings, and the Miniſter
moſt worthy of his confidence, are pleaſed
to intereſt themſelves in my fortune. This,
Sir, is an advantage of which I am juſtly
tenacious, and which I will never deſerve to
loſe. But it is neceſſary I ſhould ſpeak to
you with that frankneſs you admire. After
the many misfortunes that have befallen me,
I thought myſelf armed againſt all poſſible
events: there have happened to me ſome,
however, which I did not foreſee; and which
indeed an ingenuous mind ought not to have
foreſeen: hence it is that they affect me by
ſo much the more ſeverely. The trouble in
which they involve me, indeed, deprives me
of the eaſe and preſence of mind neceſſary
to direct my conduct: all I can reaſonably
do, under ſo diſtreſſed a ſituation, is to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
my reſolutions about every affair of ſuch
importance as is that in agitation. So far
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0564000300:33"/>
from refuſing the beneficence of the King
from pride, as is imputed to me, I am proud
of acknowleging it, and am only ſorry I
cannot do it more publicly. But when I
actually receive it, I would be able to give
up myſelf entirely to thoſe ſentiments which
it would naturally inſpire, and to have an
heart replete with gratitude for his Majeſty's
goodneſs, and yours. I am not at all afraid
this manner of thinking will make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in yours towards me. Deign, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Sir, to preſerve that goodneſs for me,
till a more happy opportunity; when you
will be ſatisfied that I defer taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it, only to render myſelf more
worthy of it. I beg of you, Sir, to accept
of my moſt humble and reſpectful ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <p>This letter appeared both to General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and to me a plain refuſal, as long as the
article of ſecrecy was inſiſted on; but as I
knew that Mr. Rouſſeau had been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that condition from the beginning,
I was the leſs ſurprized at his ſilence towards
me. I thought, that my friend, conſcious
of having treated me ill in this affair, was
aſhamed to write to me; and having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on General Conway to keep the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtill open, I wrote a very friendly letter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0564000300:34"/>
to Mr. Rouſſeau, exhorting him to return
to his former way of thinking, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the penſion.</p>
            <p>As to the deep diſtreſs which he mentions
to General Conway, and which, he ſays,
deprives him even of the uſe of his reaſon,
I was ſet very much at eaſe on that head,
by receiving a letter from Mr. Davenport;
who told me, that his gueſt was at that
very time extremely happy, eaſy, chearful, and
even ſociable. I ſaw plainly, in this event,
the uſual infirmity of my friend, who wiſhes
to intereſt the world in his favour, by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for ſickly, and perſecuted, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and unfortunate, beyond all meaſure,
even while he is the moſt happy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
His pretences of an extreme ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
had been too frequently repeated, to
have any effect on a man who was ſo well
acquainted with them.</p>
            <p>I waited three weeks in vain for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
I thought this a little ſtrange, and I
even wrote ſo to Mr. Davenport; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do with a very odd ſort of a man, and
ſtill accounting for his ſilence, by ſuppoſing
him aſhamed to write to me, I was reſolved
not to be diſcouraged, nor to loſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of doing him an eſſential ſervice, on
account of a vain ceremonial. I accordingly
renewed my applications to the Miniſters,
and was ſo happy as to be enabled to write
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0564000300:35"/>
the following letter to Mr. Rouſſeau, the

to General Conway to have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

You have but ill diſguiſed yourſelf. I know
you, and you are not ignorant of it. Before
we had any perſonal connections, quarrels,
or diſputes; while we knew each other
only by literary reputation, you affectionately
made me the offer of the good offices of
yourſelf and friends. Affected by this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
I threw myſelf into your arms;
you brought me to England, apparently to
procure me an aſylum, but in fact to bring
me to diſhonour. You applied to this noble
work, with a zeal worthy of your heart, and
a ſucceſs worthy of your abilities. You
needed not have taken ſo much pains: you
live and converſe with the world; I with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſolitude. The public love to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and you were formed to deceive them.
I know one man, however, whom you can
not deceive; I mean yourſelf. You know
with what horrour my heart rejected the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0564000300:37"/>
firſt ſuſpicion of your deſigns. You know
I embraced you with tears in my eyes, and
told you, if you were not the beſt of men,
you muſt be the blackeſt of mankind. In
reflecting on your private conduct, you muſt
ſay to yourſelf ſometimes, you are not the
beſt of men: under which conviction, I
doubt much if ever you will be the happieſt.</p>
                  <p>I leave your friends and you to carry on
your ſchemes as you pleaſe; giving up to
you, without regret, my reputation during
life; certain that ſooner or later juſtice will
be done to that of both. As to your good
offices in matters of intereſt, which you
have made uſe of as a maſk, I thank you
for them, and ſhall diſpenſe with profiting
by them. I ought not to hold a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

not remain on that footing. I ſhall chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
ſuppoſe, that ſome infamous calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
has belied me to you. But in that caſe,
it is your duty, and I am perſuaded it will
be your inclination, to give me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of detecting him, and of juſtifying
myſelf; which can only be done by your

that I have been falſe to you; but I ſay it
loudly, and will ſay it to the whole world,
that I know the contrary, that I know my
friendſhip towards you has been unbounded
and uninterrupted, and that though inſtances
of it have been very generally remarked
both in France and England, the ſmalleſt part
of it only has as yet come to the knowlege
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0564000300:39"/>
of the public. I demand, that you will
produce me the man who will aſſert the
contrary; and above all, I demand, that he
will mention any one particular in which I
have been wanting to you. You owe this
to me; you owe it to yourſelf; you owe it
to truth, and honour, and juſtice, and to
every thing that can be deemed ſacred among
men. As an innocent man; I will not ſay,
as your friend; I will not ſay, as your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor;
but, I repeat it, as an innocent
man, I claim the privilege of proving my
innocence, and of refuting any ſcandalous
lie which may have been invented againſt
me. Mr. Davenport, to whom I have ſent
a copy of your letter, and who will read this
before he delivers it, I am confident, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
my demand, and will tell you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
poſſibly can be more equitable. Happily
I have preſerved the letter you wrote me after
your arrival at Wooton; and you there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

too ſtrong, your ſatisfaction in my poor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to ſerve you: the little epiſtolary
intercourſe which afterwards paſſed between
us, has been all employed on my ſide to the
moſt friendly purpoſes. Tell me, what has
ſince given you offence? Tell me of what
I am accuſed. Tell me the man who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
me. Even after you have fulfilled all
theſe conditions, to my ſatisfaction, and to

that of Mr. Davenport, you will have great
difficulty to juſtify the employing ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous

            <p>Mr. Davenport's authority procured me,
in three weeks, the following enormous

that it confirms all the material circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM indiſpoſed, and little in a ſituation
to write; but you require an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and it muſt be given you: it was your
own fault you had it not long ſince; but
you did not deſire it, and I was therefore
ſilent: at preſent you do, and I have ſent
it. I will be a long one, for which I am
very ſorry; but I have much to ſay, and
would put an end to the ſubject at once.</p>
                  <p>As I live retired from the world, I am
ignorant of what paſſes in it. I have no
party, no aſſociates, no intrigues; I am told
nothing, and I know only what I feel. But
as care hath been taken to make me ſeverely
feel; that I well know. The firſt concern
of thoſe who engage in bad deſigns is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themſelves from legal proofs of detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
it would not be very adviſeable to ſeek
a remedy againſt them at law. The innate
conviction of the heart admits of another
kind of proof, which influences the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of honeſt men. You well know the
baſis of mine.</p>
                  <p>You aſk me, with great confidence, to
name your accuſer. That accuſer, Sir, is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0564000300:42"/>
the only man in the world whoſe teſtimony
I ſhould admit againſt you; it is yourſelf. I
ſhall give myſelf up without fear or reſerve
to the natural frankneſs of my diſpoſition;
being an enemy to every kind of artifice, I
ſhall ſpeak with the ſame freedom as if you
were an indifferent perſon, on whom I placed
all that confidence which I no longer have
in you. I will give you an hiſtory of the
emotions of my heart, and of what produced
them; while, ſpeaking of Mr. Hume in the
third perſon, I ſhall make yourſelf the judge
of what I ought to think of him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the length of my letter, I ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
no other order than that of my ideas,
beginning with the premiſes, and ending
with the demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>I quitted Switzerland, wearied out by the
barbarous treatment I had undergone; but
which affected only my perſonal ſecurity,
while my honour was ſafe. I was going, as
my heart directed me, to join my Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal;
when I received at Straſburg a moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
invitation from Mr. Hume, to go
over with him to England; where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
me the moſt agreeable reception, and
more tranquillity than I have met with. I he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
ſome time between my old friend and
my new one; in this I was wrong. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the latter, and in this was ſtill more
ſo. But the deſire of viſiting in perſon a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0564000300:43"/>
nation, of which I had heard both
ſo much good and ſo much ill, prevailed.
Aſſured I could not loſe George Keith, I
was flattered with the acquiſition of David
Hume. His great merit, extraordinary abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and eſtabliſhed probity of character,
made me deſirous of annexing his friendſhip
to that with which I was honoured by his
illuſtrious countryman. Beſides, I gloried
not a little in ſetting an example to men of
letters, in a ſincere union between two men
ſo different in their principles.</p>
                  <p>Before I had received an invitation from
the King of Pruſſia, and my Lord Marſhal,
undetermined about the place of my retreat,
I had deſired, and obtained by the intereſt of
my friends, a paſſport from the Court of
France. I made uſe of this, and went to
Paris to join Mr. Hume. He ſaw, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſaw too much of, the favourable reception
I met with from a great Prince, and I will
venture to ſay, of the public. I yielded, as
it was my duty, though with reluctance, to
that eclat; concluding how far it muſt excite
the envy of my enemies. At the ſame time,
I ſaw with pleaſure the regard which the
public entertained for Mr. Hume, ſenſibly
increaſing throughout Paris, on account
of the good work he had undertaken
with reſpect to me. Doubtleſs he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0564000300:44"/>
too; but I know not if it was in the
ſame manner as I was.</p>
                  <p>We ſet out with one of my friends, who
came to England almoſt entirely on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
When we were landed at Dover,
tranſported with the thoughts of having ſet
foot in this land of liberty, under the conduct
of ſo celebrated a perſon, I threw my arms
round his neck, and preſſed him to my heart,
without ſpeaking a ſyllable; bathing his checks,
as I kiſſed them, with tears ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
This was not the only, not the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
inſtance I have given him of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
of an heart full of ſenſibility. I know not
what he does with the recollection of them,
when that happens; but I have a notion
they muſt be ſometimes troubleſome to him.</p>
                  <p>At our arrival in London, we were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
careſſed and entertained: all ranks of
people eagerly preſſing to give me marks of
their benevolence and eſteem. Mr. Hume
preſented me politely to every body; and it
was natural for me to aſcribe to him, as I
did, the beſt part of my good reception. My
heart was full of him. I ſpoke in his praiſe
to every one, I wrote to the ſame purpoſe to
all my friends; my attachment to him ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
every day new ſtrength, while his
appeared the moſt affectionate to me; of
which he frequently gave me inſtances that
touched me extremely. That of cauſing my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0564000300:45"/>
portrait to be painted, however, was not of
the number. This ſeemed to me to carry
with it too much the affectation of popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and had an air of oſtentation which by
no means pleaſed me. All this, however,
might have been eaſily excuſable, had Mr.
Hume been a man apt to throw away his
money, or had a gallery of pictures with
the portraits of his friends. After all, I freely
confeſs, that, on this head, I may be in the
wrong<note n="*" place="bottom">The fact was this. My friend, Mr. Ramſay, a painter of eminence, and a man of merit, propoſed to draw Mr. Rouſſeau's picture; and when he had begun it, told me he intended to make me a preſent of it. Thus the deſign of having Mr. Rouſſeau's picture drawn did not come from me, nor did it coſt me any thing. Mr. Rouſſeau, therefore, is equally contemptible in paying me a compliment for this pretended gallantry, in his letter of the 29th of March, and in converting it into ridicule here. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>But what appears to me an act of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and generoſity the moſt undoubted and
eſtimable, in a word, the moſt worthy of
Mr. Hume, was the care he took to ſolicit
for me, of his own accord, a penſion from the
King; to which moſt aſſuredly I had no right
to aſpire. As I was a witneſs to the zeal he
exerted in that affair, I was greatly affected
with it. Nothing could flatter me more than
a piece of ſervice of that nature; not merely
for the ſake of intereſt; for, too much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0564000300:46"/>
perhaps, to what I actually poſſeſs,
I am not capable of deſiring what I have not,
and as I am able to ſubſiſt on my labour and
the aſſiſtance of my friends, I covet nothing
more. But the honour of receiving teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the goodneſs, I will not ſay of ſo
great a monarch, but of ſo good a father, ſo
good a huſband, ſo good a maſter, ſo good
a friend, and above all, ſo worthy a man,
was ſenſibly affecting: and when I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
farther, that the miniſter who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for me this favour, was a living inſtance
of that probity which of all others is the moſt
important to mankind, and at the ſame time
hardly ever met with in the only character
wherein it can be uſeful, I could not check
the emotions of my pride, at having for my
benefactors three men, who of all the world
I could moſt deſire to have my friends. Thus,
ſo far from refuſing the penſion offered me,
I only made one condition neceſſary for my
acceptance; this was the conſent of a perſon,
whom I could not, without neglecting my
duty, fail to conſult.</p>
                  <p>Being honoured with the civilities of all
the world, I endeavoured to make a proper
return. In the mean time, my bad ſtate of
health, and being accuſtomed to live in the
country, made my reſidence in town very
diſagreeable. Immediately country houſes
preſented themſelves in plenty; I had my
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0564000300:47"/>
choice of all the counties of England. Mr.
Hume took the trouble to receive theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,
and to repreſent them to me; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
me to two or three in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
counties. I heſitated a good while in my
choice, and he increaſed the difficulty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.
At length, I fixed on this
place, and immediately Mr. Hume ſettled
the affair; all difficulties vaniſhed, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
arriving preſently at this ſolitary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and agreeable habitation; where the
owner of the houſe provides every thing, and
nothing is wanting. I became tranquil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant;
and this ſeemed to be the wiſhed
for moment, when all my misfortunes ſhould
have an end. On the contrary, it was now
they began; misfortunes more cruel than any
I had yet experienced.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken in the fulneſs of
my heart, and to do juſtice, with the greateſt
pleaſure, to the good offices of Mr. Hume.
Would to Heaven that what remains for me
to ſay were of the ſame nature! It would
never give me pain to ſpeak what would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to his honour; nor is it proper to ſet
a value on benefits till one is accuſed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude;
which is the caſe at preſent. I
will venture to make one obſervation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which renders it neceſſary. In eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
the ſervices of Mr. Hume, by the
time and the pains they took him up, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0564000300:48"/>
were of an infinite value, and that ſtill more
from the good-will diſplayed in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
but for the actual ſervice they
were of to me, it was much more in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
than reality. I did not come over
to beg my bread in England; I brought the
means of ſubſiſtence with me. I came merely
to ſeek an aſylum in a country which is open
to every ſtranger without diſtinction. I was,
beſides, not ſo totally unknown as that, if I
had arrived alone, I ſhould have wanted either
aſſiſtance or ſervice. If ſome perſons have
ſought my acquaintance for the ſake of Mr.
Hume, others have ſought it for my own.
Thus when Mr. Davenport, for example,
was ſo kind as to offer my preſent retreat, it
was not for the ſake of Mr. Hume, whom
he did not know, and whom he ſaw only in
order to deſire him to make me his obliging
propoſal. So that when Mr. Hume endeavours
to alienate from me this worthy man, he
takes that from me which he did not give
me<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Rouſſeau forms a wrong judgment of me, and ought to know me better. I have written to Mr. Davenport, even ſince our rupture, to engage him to continue his kindneſs to his unhappy gueſt. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. All the good that hath been done me,
would have been done me nearly the ſame
without him, and perhaps better; but the
evil would not have been done me at all: for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0564000300:49"/>
why ſhould I have enemies in England?
Why are thoſe enemies all the friends of Mr.
Hume? Who could have excited their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt me? It certainly was not I; who
knew nothing of them, nor ever ſaw them
in my life: I ſhould not have had a ſingle
enemy had I come to England alone<note n="*" place="bottom">How ſtrange are the effects of a diſordered ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination! Mr. Rouſſeau tells us he is ignorant of what paſſes in the world, and yet talks of the enemies he has in England. How does he know this? Where did he ſee them? He hath received nothing but marks of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and hoſpitality. Mr. Walpole is the only perſon who hath thrown out a little piece of raillery againſt him; but is not therefore his enemy. If Mr. Rouſſeau could have ſeen things exactly as they are, he would have ſeen that he had no other friend in England but me, and no other enemy but himſelf. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>I have hitherto dwelt upon public and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
facts; which from their own nature,
and my acknowledgment, have made the
greateſt eclat. Thoſe which are to follow
are particular and ſecret, at leaſt in their
cauſe, and all poſſible meaſures have been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to keep the knowledge of them from the
public; but as they are well known to the
perſon intereſted, they will not have the leſs
influence toward his own conviction.</p>
                  <p>A very ſhort time after our arrival in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
I obſerved an abſurd change in the
minds of the people regarding me, which
ſoon became very apparent. Before I arrived
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0564000300:50"/>
in England, there was not a nation in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
in which I had a greater reputation, I
will venture to ſay, was held in greater eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
The public papers were full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
on me, and a general outcry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on my perſecutors<note n="*" place="bottom">That a general outcry ſhould prevail againſt Mr. Rouſſeau's perſecutors in England is no wonder: ſuch an outcry would have prevailed from ſentiments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, had he been a perſon of much leſs note; ſo that this is no proof of his being eſteemed: and as to the enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums on him inſerted in the public news papers, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſuch kind of puffs is well known in England. I have already obſerved that the authors of more reſpectable works were at no loſs what to think of Mr. Rouſſeau; but had formed a proper judgment of him long before his arrival in England. The genius which diſplayed itſelf in his writings, did, by no means, blind the eyes of the more ſenſible part of mankind to the abſurdity and inconſiſtency of his opinions and conduct. In exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Mr. Rouſſeau's fanatical perſecutors, they did not think him the more poſſeſſed of the true ſpirit of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. The general opinion indeed, was, that he had too much philoſophy to be very devout, and had too much devotion to have much philoſophy.

                        </bibl>
                     </note>. This was the
caſe at my arrival, which was publiſhed in
the news papers with triumph; England
prided itſelf in affording me refuge, and
juſtly gloried on that occaſion in its laws and
government: when, all of a ſudden, without
the leaſt aſſignable cauſe, the tone was
changed; and that ſo ſpeedily and totally,
that of all the caprices of the public, never
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0564000300:51"/>
was known any thing more ſurprizing. The
ſignal was given in a certain <hi>Magazine,</hi>
equally full of follies and falſhoods, in which
the author, being well informed, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be ſo, gives me out for the ſon of a
muſician. From this time<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Rouſſeau knows very little of the public judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in England, if he thinks it is to be influenced by any ſtory told in a certain Magazine. But, as I have before ſaid, it was not from this time that Mr. Rouſſeau was ſlightingly ſpoke of, but long before; and that in a more conſequential manner. Perhaps, indeed, Mr. Rouſſeau ought in juſtice to impute great part of thoſe civilities he met with on his arrival, rather to vanity and curioſity than to reſpect and eſteem.
<bibl>
                           <hi>Engliſh tranſlator.</hi>
                        </bibl>
                     </note>, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſpoken of in print in a very equivocal
or ſlighting manner. Every thing that had
been publiſhed concerning my misfortunes
was miſrepreſented, altered, or placed in a
wrong light, and always as much as poſſible
to my diſadvantage. So far was any body
from ſpeaking of the reception I met with at
Paris, and which had made but too much
noiſe, it was not generally ſuppoſed that I
durſt have appeared in that city; even one of
Mr. Hume's friends being very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
when I told him I came through it.</p>
                  <p>Accuſtomed as I had been too much to
the inconſtancy of the public, to be affected
by this inſtance of it, I could not help being
aſtoniſhed, however, at a change, ſo very
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0564000300:52"/>
ſudden and general, that not one of thoſe
who had ſo much praiſed me in my abſence,
appeared, now I was preſent, to think even
of my exiſtence. I thought it ſomething
very odd that, immediately after the return of
Mr. Hume, who had ſo much credit in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
with ſo much influence over the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers
and men of letters, and ſuch great
connections with them, his preſence ſhould
produce an effect ſo contrary to what might
have been expected; that among ſo many
writers of every kind, not one of his friends
ſhould ſhew himſelf to be mine; while it
was eaſy to be ſeen, that thoſe who ſpoke
of him were not his enemies, ſince, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
his public character, they reported
that I had come through France under his
protection, and by favour of a paſſport
which he had obtained of the court; nay,
they almoſt went ſo far as to inſinuate, that
I came over in his retinue, and at his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
All this was of little ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and was only ſingular; but what
was much more ſo, was, that his friends
changed their tone with me as much as the
public. I ſhall always take a pleaſure in
ſaying that they were ſtill equally ſolicitous
to ſerve me, and that they exerted themſelves
greatly in my favour; but ſo far were they
from ſhewing me the ſame reſpect, particularly
the gentleman at whoſe houſe we alighted
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0564000300:53"/>
on our arrival, that he accompanied all his
actions with diſcourſe ſo rude, and ſometimes
ſo inſulting, that one would have thought
he had taken an occaſion to oblige me,
merely to have a right to expreſs his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt<note n="*" place="bottom">This relates to my friend Mr. John Stewart, who entertained Mr. Rouſſeau at his houſe, and did him all the good offices in his power. Mr. Rouſſeau, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of this gentleman's behaviour, forgets that he wrote Mr. Stewart a letter from Wooton, full of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegements, and juſt expreſſions of gratitude. What Mr. Rouſſeau adds, regarding the brother of Mr. Stewart, is neither civil nor true.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>.
His brother, who was at firſt
very polite and obliging, altered his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
with ſo little reſerve, that he would
hardly deign to ſpeak a ſingle word to me
even in their own houſe, in return to a civil
ſalutation, or to pay any of thoſe civilities
which are uſually paid in like circumſtances
to ſtrangers. Nothing new had happened,
however, except the arrival of J. J. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau
and David Hume: and certainly the
cauſe of theſe alterations did not come from
me, unleſs indeed too great a portion of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
diſcretion, and modeſty, be the
cauſe of offence in England. As to Mr.
Hume, he was ſo far from aſſuming ſuch a
diſguſting tone, that he gave into the other
extreme. I have always looked upon flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0564000300:54"/>
with an eye of ſuſpicion: and he was
ſo full of all kinds<note n="†" place="bottom">I ſhall mention only one, that made me ſmile; this was, his attention to have, every time I came to ſee him, a volume of <hi>Elciſa</hi> upon his table; as if I did not know enough of Mr. Hume's taſte for reading, as to be well aſſured, that of all books in the world, Eloiſa muſt be one of the moſt tireſome to him.
<bibl>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</bibl>
                     </note> of flattery, that he
even obliged me, when I could bear it no
longer<note n="‡" place="bottom">The reader may judge from the two firſt letters of Mr. Rouſſeau, which I publiſhed with that view, on which ſide the ſlatteries commenced. As for the reſt, I loved and eſteemed Mr. Rouſſeau, and took a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in giving him to underſtand ſo. I might perhaps be too laviſh in my praiſes; but I can aſſure the reader he never once complained of it.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>, to tell him my ſentiments on that
head. His behaviour was ſuch as to render
few words neceſſary, yet I could have wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had ſubſtituted, in the room of ſuch
groſs encomiums, ſometimes the language
of a friend; but I never found any thing in
his, which favoured of true friendſhip, not
even in his manner of ſpeaking of me to
others in my preſence. One would have
thought that, in endeavouring to procure
me patrons, he ſtrove to deprive me of their
good-will; that he ſought rather to have
me aſſiſted than loved; and I have been
ſometimes ſurprized at the rude turn he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0564000300:55"/>
hath given to my behaviour before people
who might not unreaſonably have taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at it. I ſhall give an example of what
I mean. Mr. Pennick of the Muſeum, a
friend of my Lord Marſhal's, and miniſter
of a pariſh where I was ſolicited to refide,
came to ſee me. Mr. Hume made my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
while I myſelf was preſent, for not
having paid him a viſit. Doctor Matty,
ſaid he, invited us on Thurſday to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeum,
where Mr. Rouſſeau ſhould have ſeen
you; but he choſe rather to go with Mrs.
Garrick to the play: we could not do both
the ſame day<note n="*" place="bottom">I don't recollect a ſingle circumſtance of this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but what makes me give very little credit to it, is, that I remember very well we had ſettled two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent days for the purpoſes mentioned, that is, one to go to the Muſeum, and another to the play.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. You will confeſs, Sir, this
was a ſtrange method of recommending me
to Mr. Pennick.</p>
                  <p>I know not what Mr. Hume might ſay
in private of me to his acquaintance, but
nothing was more extraordinary than their
behaviour to me, even by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and even often through his own means.
Although my purſe was not empty, and I
needed not that of any other perſon; which
he very well knew; yet any one would have
thought I was come over to ſubſiſt on the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0564000300:56"/>
charity of the public, and that nothing
more was to be done than to give me alms
in ſuch a manner as to ſave me a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion<note n="†" place="bottom">I conceive Mr. Rouſſeau hints here at two or three dinners, that were ſent him from the houſe of Mr. Steward, when he choſe to dine at his own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; this was not done, however, to ſave him the expence of a meal, but becauſe there was no conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient tavern or chop-houſe in the neighbourhood. I beg the reader's pardon for deſcending to ſuch trivial particulars. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>

I muſt own, this conſtant and
inſolent piece of affectation was one of thoſe
things which made me averſe to reſide in
London. This certainly was not the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on which any man ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
in England, had there been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of procuring him ever ſo little reſpect.
This diſplay of charity, however, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a more favourable interpretation, and
I conſent it ſhould. To proceed.</p>
                  <p>At Paris was publiſhed a fictitious letter
from the King of Pruſſia, addreſſed to me,
and replete with the moſt cruel malignity.
I learned with ſurprize that it was one Mr.
Walpole, a friend of Mr. Hume's, who was
the editor; I aſked him if it were true; in
anſwer to which queſtion, he only aſked me,
of whom I had the information. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before he had given me a card for this
ſame Mr. Walpole, written to engage him
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0564000300:57"/>
to bring over ſuch papers as related to me
from Paris, and which I wanted to have by
a ſafe hand.</p>
                  <p>I was informed that the ſon of that
quack<note n="*" place="bottom">We have not been authorized to ſuppreſs this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting term; but it is too groſs and groundleſs to do any injury to the celebrated and reſpectable phyſician to whoſe name it is annexed.

                     </note> Tronchin, my moſt mortal enemy,
was not only the friend of Mr. Hume, and
under his protection, but that they both
lodged in the ſame houſe together; and when
Mr. Hume found that I knew it, he impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in confidence; aſſuring me at the ſame
time, that the ſon was by no means like the
father. I lodged a few nights myſelf, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with my governante, in the ſame
houſe; and by the air and manner with
which we were received by the landladies,
who are his friends, I judged in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
either Mr. Hume, or that man, who,
as he ſaid, who by no means like his father,
muſt have ſpoken to them both of her and
me<note n="†" place="bottom">Thus am I accuſed of treachery, becauſe I am a friend of Mr. Walpole, who hath thrown out a little raillery on Mr. Rouſſeau; and becauſe the ſon of a man whom Mr. Rouſſeau does not like, lodges by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in the ſame houſe; becauſe my landladies, who do not underſtand a ſyllable of French, received Mr. Rouſſeau coldly. As to the reſt, and that I ſaid to Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau about the young Tronchin was, that he had not the ſame prejudices againſt him as his father. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0564000300:58"/>
All theſe facts put together, added to a
certain appearance of things on the whole,
inſenſibly gave me an uneaſineſs, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
with horror. In the mean time, I
found the letters I wrote did not come to
hand; thoſe I received had often been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and all went through the hands of Mr.
Hume<note n="†" place="bottom">The ſtory of Mr. Rouſſeau's letters is as follows. He had often been complaining to me, and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he was ruined by poſtage at Neuf-chatel, which commonly coſt him 25 or 26 louis d'ors a year; and all for letters which were of no ſignificance, being wrote, ſome of them by people who took that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of abuſing him, and moſt of them by perſons unknown to him: he was therefore reſolved, he ſaid, in England to receive no letters which came by the poſt; and the ſame reſolution he re-iterates in his letter to me dated the 22d of March. When he went to Chiſwick, near London, the poſt-man brought his letters to me. I carried him out a cargo of them: he exclaimed, deſired me to return the letters, and recover the price of poſtage: I told him, that in that caſe, the clerks of the poſt-office were entire maſters of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: he ſaid, he was indifferent; they might do with them what they pleaſed. I added, that he would by that means be cut off from all correſpondence with all his friends: he replied, that he would give a particular direction to ſuch as he deſired to correſpond with. But till his inſtructions for that purpoſe could arrive, what could I do more friendly, than to ſave, at my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, his letters from the curioſity and indiſcretion of the clerks of the poſt-office? I am indeed aſhamed to find myſelf obliged to diſcover ſuch petty circumſtances.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. If at any time any one eſcaped
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0564000300:59"/>
him, he could not conceal his eagerneſs to
ſee it. One evening in particular I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a very remarkable circumſtance of this
kind, that greatly ſtruck me<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is neceſſary to explain this circumſtance. I had been writing on Mr. Hume's table, during his abſence, an anſwer to a letter I had juſt received. He came in, very curious to know what I had been writing, and hardly able to contain himſelf from deſiring to read it. I cloſed my letter, however, without ſhewing it him; when, as I was putting it into my pocket, he aſked me for it eagerly, ſaying, he would ſend it away on the morrow, being poſt-day. The letter lay on the table. Lord Newnham came in. Mr. Hume went out of the room for a moment; on which I took the letter up again, ſaying I ſhould find time to ſend it the next day. Lord Newnham offered to get it incloſed in the French ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's packet; which I accepted. Mr. Hume re-entered the moment his lordſhip had incloſed it, and was pulling out his ſeal. Mr. Hume officiouſly offered his own ſeal, and that with ſo much earneſtneſs, that it could not well be refuſed. The bell was rung, and Lord Newnham gave the letter to Mr. Hume's ſervant, to give it his own, who waited below with the chariot, in order to have it ſent to the ambaſſador. Mr. Hume's ſervant was hardly got out of the room, but I ſaid to myſelf, I'll lay a wager the maſter follows. He did not fail to do as I expected. Not knowing how to leave Lord Newn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham alone, I ſtaid ſome time, before I followed Mr. Hume. I ſaid nothing; but he muſt perceive that I was uneaſy. Thus, although I have received no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my letter, I doubt not of its going to hand; but I confeſs, I cannot help ſuſpecting it was read firſt. <bibl>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</bibl>
                     </note>. As we
were ſitting one evening, after ſupper, ſilent
by the fire-ſide, I caught his eyes intently
fixed on mine, as indeed happened very
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0564000300:60"/>
often; and that in a manner of which it is
very difficult to give an idea; at that time
he gave me a ſtedfaſt, piercing look, mixed
with a ſneer, which greatly diſturbed me.
To get rid of the embarraſsment I lay under,
I endeavoured to look full at him in my
turn; but, in fixing my eyes againſt his,
I felt the moſt inexpreſſible terror, and was
obliged ſoon to turn them away. The ſpeech
and phyſiognomy of the good David is that
of an honeſt man; but where, great God!
did this good man borrow thoſe eyes he fixes
ſo ſternly and unaccountably on thoſe of his
friends!</p>
                  <p>The impreſſion of this look remained
with me, and gave me much uneaſineſs.
My trouble increaſed even to a degree of
fainting; and if I had not been relieved by
an effuſion of tears, I had been ſuffocated.
Preſently after this I was ſeized with the
moſt violent remorſe; I even deſpiſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
till at length, in a tranſport, which I
ſtill remember with delight, I ſprang on his
neck, embraced him eagerly; while almoſt
choked with ſobbing, and bathed in tears, I
cried out, in broken accents, <hi>No, no, David
Hume cannot be treacherous; if he be not the
beſt of men, he must be the baſeſt of mankind.</hi>
David Hume politely returned my embraces,
and gently tapping me on the back, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeveral times, in a good-natured and eaſy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0564000300:61"/>
tone, <hi>Why, what my dear Sir! Nay, my
dear Sir ! Oh! my dear Sir!</hi> He ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more. I felt my heart yearn within
me. We went to bed; and I ſet out the
next day for the country.</p>
                  <p>Arrived at this agreeable aſylum, to which
I have travelled ſo far in ſearch of repoſe, I
ought to find it in a retired, convenient, and
pleaſant habitation; the maſter of which, a
man of underſtanding and worth, ſpares
for nothing to render it agreeable to me.
But what repoſe can be taſted in life, when
the heart is agitated? Afflicted with the
moſt cruel uncertainty, and ignorant what
to think of a man whom I ought to love
and eſteem, I endeavoured to get rid of that
fatal doubt, in placing confidence in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.
For, wherefore, from what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
caprice ſhould be diſplay ſo
much apparent zeal for my happineſs, and
at the ſame time entertain ſecret deſigns
againſt my honour. Among the ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
that diſturbed me, each fact was
in itſelf of no great moment; it was their
concurrence that was ſurprizing; yet I
thought, perhaps, that Mr. Hume, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of other facts, of which I was ignorant,
could have given me a ſatisfactory ſolution
of them, had we come to an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The only thing that was inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
was, that he refuſed to come to ſuch
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0564000300:62"/>
an explanation; which both his honour
and his friendſhip rendered equally neceſſary.
I ſaw very well there was ſomething in the
affair which I did not comprehend, and
which I earneſtly wiſhed to know. Before
I came to an abſolute determination, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with regard to him, I was deſirous
of making another effort, and to try to
recover him, if he had permitted himſelf
to be ſeduced by my enemies, or in ſhort to
prevail on him to explain himſelf one way
or other. Accordingly I wrote him a letter,
which he ought to have found very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural<note n="*" place="bottom">It appears from what he wrote to me afterwards, that he was very well ſatisfied with this letter, and that he thought of it very well. <bibl>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</bibl>
                     </note>,
if he were guilty; but very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
if he were innocent. For what
could be more extraordinary than a letter
full of gratitude for his ſervices, and at the
ſame time, of diſtruſt of his ſentiments;
and in which, placing in a manner his
actions on one ſide, and his ſentiments on
the other, inſtead of ſpeaking of the proofs
of friendſhip he had given me, I deſired
him to love me, for the good he had done
me<note n="†" place="bottom">My anſwer to this is contained in Mr. Rouſſeau's own letter of the 22d of March; wherein he expreſſes himſelf with the utmoſt cordiality, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and without the leaſt appearance of ſuſpicion.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>? I did not take the precaution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0564000300:63"/>
a copy of this letter; but as he hath
done it, let him produce it: and whoever
ſhall read it, and ſee therein a man labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under a ſecret trouble, which he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of expreſſing, and is afraid to do it,
will, I am perſuaded, be curious to know
what kind of eclairciſſement it produced,
eſpecially after the preceeding ſcene. None.
Abſolutely none at all. Mr. Hume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himſelf, in his anſwer, with only
ſpeaking of the obliging offices Mr. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
propoſed to do for me. As for the reſt,
he ſaid not a word of the principal ſubject of
my letter, nor of the ſituation of my heart,
of whoſe diſtreſs he could not be ignorant.
I was more ſtruck with this ſilence, than I
had been with his phlegm during our laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
In this I was wrong; this ſilence
was very natural after the other, and was no
more than I ought to have expected. For
when one hath ventured to declare to man's
face, <hi>I am tempted to believe you a traitor,</hi>
and he hath not the curioſity to aſk you <hi>for
what</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">All this hangs upon the fable he had ſo artfully worked up, as I before obſerved. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>, it may be depended on he will never
have any ſuch curioſity as long as he lives;
and it is eaſy to judge of him from theſe ſlight
indications.</p>
                  <p>After the receipt of his letter, which was
long delayed, I determined at length to write
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0564000300:64"/>
to him no more. Soon after, every thing
ſerved to confirm me in the reſolution to
break off all farther correſpondence with him.
Curious to the laſt degree concerning the
minuteſt circumſtance of my affairs, he was
not content to learn them of me, in our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
converſations; but, as I learned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
let ſlip an opportunity of being alone
with my governante<note n="†" place="bottom">I had only one ſuch opportunity with his gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante, which was on their arrival in London. I muſt own it never entered into my head to talk to her upon any other ſubject than the concerns of Mr. Rouſſeau.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>, to interrogate her
even importunately concerning my occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
my reſources, my friends, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
their names, ſituations, place of abode,
and all this after ſetting out with telling her
he was well acquainted with the whole of
my connections; nay, with the moſt jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itical
addreſs, he would aſk the ſame queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of us ſeparately. One ought undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
to intereſt one's ſelf in the affairs of a
friend; but one ought to be ſatisfied with
what he thinks proper to let us know of them,
particularly when people are ſo frank and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
as I am. Indeed all this petty inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiveneſs
is very little becoming a philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time I received two other
letters which had been opened. The one
from Mr. Boſwell, the ſeal of which was ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0564000300:65"/>
looſe and disfigured, that Mr. Davenport,
when he received it, remarked the ſame to
Mr. Hume's ſervant. The other was from
Mr. d'Ivernois, in Mr. Hume's packet, and
which had been ſealed up again by means of
a hot iron, which, aukwardly applied, had
burnt the paper round the impreſſion. On
this, I wrote to Mr. Davenport to deſire
him to take charge of all the letters which
might be ſent for me, and to truſt none of
them in any body's hands, under any pretext
whatever. I know not whether Mr. Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
who certainly was far from thinking
that precaution was to be obſerved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to Mr. Hume, ſhowed him my letter
or not; but this I know, that the latter had
all the reaſon in the world to think he had
forfeited my confidence, and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
nevertheleſs in his uſual manner,
without troubling himſelf about the recovery
of it.</p>
                  <p>But what was to become of me, when I
ſaw, in the public papers, the pretended letter
of the King of Pruſſia, which I had never
before ſeen, that fictitious letter, printed in
French and Engliſh, given for genuine, even
with the ſignature of the King, and in which
I knew the pen of Mr. d'Alembert as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
as if I had ſeen him write it<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. d'Alembert's declaration on this head, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this narrative.</note>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0564000300:66"/>
In a moment a ray of light diſcovered to
me the ſecret cauſe of that touching and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
change, which I had obſerved in the
public reſpecting me; and I ſaw the plot
which was put in execution at London, had
been laid in Paris.</p>
                  <p>Mr. d'Alembert, another intimate friend
of Mr. Hume's, had been long ſince my
ſecret enemy, and lay in watch for opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to injure me without expoſing himſelf.
He was the only perſon, among the men of
letters, of my old acquaintance, who did
not come to ſee me<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Rouſſeau declares himſelf to have been fatigued with the viſits he received; ought he therefore to complain that Mr. d'Alembert, whom he did not like, did not importune him with his? <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>, or ſend their civilities
during my laſt paſſage through Paris. I
knew his ſecret diſpoſition, but I gave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very little trouble about it, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
myſelf with adviſing my friends of it
occaſionally. I remember that being aſked
about him one day by Mr. Hume, who
afterwards aſked my governante the ſame
queſtion, I told him that Mr. d'Alembert
was a cunning, artful man. He contradicted
me with a warmth that ſurprized me; not
then knowing they ſtood ſo well with each
other, and that it was his own cauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0564000300:67"/>
The peruſal of the letter above mentioned
alarmed me a good deal, when, perceiving
that I had been brought over to England in
conſequence of a project which began to be
put in execution, but of the end of which I
was ignorant, I felt the danger without
knowing what to guard againſt, or on whom
to rely. I then recollected four terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words Mr. Hume had made uſe of, and
of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. What could
be thought of a paper in which my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
were imputed to me as a crime, which
tended, in the midſt of my diſtreſs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
me of all compaſſion, and, to render
its effects ſtill more cruel, pretended to have
been written by a Prince who had afforded
me protection? What could I divine would
be the conſequence of ſuch a beginning?
The people in England read the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and are in no wiſe prepoſſeſſed in favour
of foreigners. Even a coat, cut in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
faſhion from their own, is ſufficient
to excite a prejudice againſt them. What then
had not a poor ſtranger to expect in his rural
walks, the only pleaſures of his life, when
the good people in the neighbourhood were
once thoroughly perſuaded he was fond of
being perſecuted and pelted? Doubtleſs they
would be ready enough to contribute to his
favourite amuſement. But my concern, my
profound and cruel concern, the bittereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0564000300:68"/>
I ever felt, did not ariſe from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to which I was perſonally expoſed. I
had braved too many others to be much
moved with that. The treachery of a falſe
friend<note n="*" place="bottom">This <hi>falſe friend,</hi> is, undoubtedly, myſelf. But what is the treachery? What harm have I done, or could I do to Mr. Rouſſeau? On the ſuppoſition of my entering into a project to ruin him, how could I think to bring it about by the ſervices I did him? If Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau ſhould gain credit, I muſt be thought ſtill more weak than wicked. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note> to which I had fallen a prey, was
the circumſtance that filled my too ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
heart with deadly ſorrow. In the
impetuoſity of its firſt emotions, of which I
never yet was maſter, and of which my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
have artfully taken the advantage, I
wrote ſeveral letters full of diſorder, in which
I did not diſguiſe either my anxiety or indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>I have, Sir, ſo many things to mention,
that I forget half of them by the way. For
inſtance, a certain narrative in form of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
concerning my manner of living at
Montmorency, was given by the bookſellers
to Mr. Hume, who ſhewed it me. I agreed
to its being printed, and Mr. Hume under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the care of its edition; but it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
Again, I had brought over with me
a copy of the letters of Mr. du Peyrou, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a relation of the treatment I had met
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0564000300:69"/>
with at Neuſchatel. I gave them into the
hands of the ſame bookſeller to have them
tranſlated and reprinted. Mr. Hume charged
himſelf with the care of them; but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
appeared<note n="†" place="bottom">The bookſellers have lately informed me that the edition is finiſhed, and will ſhortly be publiſhed. This may be; but it is too late, and what is ſtill worſe, it is too opportune for the purpoſe intended to be ſerved.
<bibl>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</bibl>
                     </note>. The ſuppoſititious letter of
the King of Pruſſia, and its tranſlation, had
no ſooner made their appearance, than I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
comprehended why the other
pieces had been ſuppreſſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is about four months ſince Mr. Becket, the bookſeller, told Mr. Rouſſeau that the publication of theſe pieces was delayed on account of the indiſpoſition of the tranſlator. As for any thing elſe, I never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to take any change at all of the edition, as Mr. Becket can testify. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>, and I wrote as
much to the bookſellers<note n="‖" place="bottom">As to Mr. Rouſſeau's ſuſpicions of the cauſe of the <hi>ſuppreſſion,</hi> as he calls it, of the Narrative and Letters above mentioned, the tranſlator thinks it incumbent on him to affirm, they were entirely groundleſs. It is true, as Mr. Becket told Mr. Hume, that the tranſlator of the letters was indiſpoſed about that time. But the principal cauſe of the delay was, that he was of his own mere motion, no leſs indiſpoſed to thoſe pieces making their appearance in Engliſh at <note n="*" place="bottom">For, ſo far were the bookſellers from intending to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> theſe pieces, that they actually reprinted the French edition of Peyrou's letters, and publiſhed it in London.</note> all; and this not out of ill will to Mr. Rouſſeau, or good will to Mr. Hume, neither of which he ever ſaw, or ſpoke to, in his life; but really out of regard to the character and reputation of a man, whoſe genius he admired, and whoſe works he had tranſlated: well knowing the publication of ſuch ſquabbles could do Mr. Rouſſeau no good in the opinion of the more judicious and ſenſible part of mankind. With regard to the tranſlation of the Narrative of his manner of living at Montmorency, I never ſaw it till it was actually printed; when Mr. Becket put it into my hands, and I frankly told him that I thought it a very unſeaſonable, puerile affair, and could by no means ſerve to advance Mr. Rouſſeau's eſtimation in the eyes of the public. It was certainly of great importance to the good people of England, to know how Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau amuſed himſelf 7 or 8 years ago at Montmorency, that he cooked his own broth, and did not leave it to the management of his nurſe, for fear ſhe ſhould have a better dinner than himſelf! Yet this is one of the moſt remarkable circumſtances contained in that narrative, except indeed that we are told, Mr. Rouſſeau is a moſt paſſionate admirer of virtue, and that his eyes always ſparkle at the bare mention of that word—O Virtue! how greatly is thy name proſtituted! And how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0564000300:70"/>
other letters alſo, which probably were
handed about London; till at length I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
the credit of a man of quality and
merit, to inſert a declaration of the impoſture
in the public papers. In this declaration. I
concealed no part of my extreme concern;
nor did I in the leaſt diſguiſe the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto Mr. Hume ſeems to have walked

                  <p>When this pretended letter from the King
of Pruſſia was firſt publiſhed in London,
Mr. Hume, who certainly knew that it was
fictitious, as I had told him ſo, yet ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the matter, did not write to me,
but was totally ſilent; and did not even think
of making any declaration, of the truth, in
favour of his abſent friend<note n="*" place="bottom">No body could poſſibly be miſtaken with regard to the letter's being fictitious; beſides it was well known that Mr. Walpole was the author of it. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. It anſwered
his purpoſe better to let the report take its
courſe, as he did.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hume having been my conductor
into England, he was of courſe in a manner
my patron and protector. If it were but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
in him to undertake my defence, it
was to leſs ſo that, when I had a public
proteſtation to make, I ſhould have addreſſed
myſelf to him. Having already ceaſed writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Rouſſeau forgets himſelf here. It was but a week before that he wrote me a very friendly letter. See his letter of the 29th of March. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>, however, I had no mind to
renew our correſpondence. I addreſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
therefore to another perſon. The firſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0564000300:72"/>
ſlap on the face I gave my patron. He felt
nothing of it.</p>
                  <p>In ſaying the letter was fabricated at Paris,
it was of very little conſequence to me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was underſtood particularly of Mr.
d'Alembert, or of Mr. Walpole, whoſe
name he borrowed on the occaſion. But
in adding that, what afflicted and tore my
heart was, the impoſtor had got his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
in England; I expreſſed myſelf very
clearly to their friend, who was in London,
and was deſirous of paſſing for mine. For
certainly he was the only perſon in England,
whoſe hatred could afflict and rend my heart.
This was the ſecond ſlap of the face I gave
my patron. He did not feel, however, yet.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, he maliciouſly pretended
that my affliction aroſe ſolely from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the above letter, in order to make
me paſs for a man who was exceſſively
affected by ſatire. Whether I am vain or
not, certain it is I was mortally afflicted; he
knew it, and yet wrote me not a word.
This affectionate friend, who had ſo much
at heart the filling of my purſe, gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
no trouble to think my heart was bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Another piece appeared ſoon after, in the
ſame papers, by the author of the former,
and ſtill if poſſible more cruel; in which the
writer could not diſguiſe his rage at the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0564000300:73"/>
I met with at Paris<note n="*" place="bottom">I know nothing of this pretended libel.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. This however did
not affect me; it told me nothing new. Mere
libels may take their courſe without giving
me any emotion; and the inconſtant public
may amuſe themſelves as long as they pleaſe
with the ſubject. It is not an affair of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
who, bent on the deſtruction of
my honeſt fame, are determined by ſome
means or other to effect it. It was neceſſary
to change the battery.</p>
                  <p>The affair of the penſion was not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
It was not difficult, however, for
Mr. Hume to obtain, from the humanity of
the miniſter, and the generoſity of the King,
the favour of its determination. He was
required to inform me of it, which he did.
This, I muſt confeſs, was one of the critical
moments of my life. How much did it coſt
me to do my duty! My preceding engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the neceſſity of ſhewing a due reſpect
for the goodneſs of the King, and for that
of his miniſter, together with the deſire of
diſplaying how far I was ſenſible of both;
add to theſe the advantage of being made a
little more eaſy in circumſtances in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
of life, ſurrounded as I was by enemies
and evils; in fine, the embarraſſment I was
under to find a decent excuſe for not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0564000300:74"/>
a benefit already half accepted; all theſe
together made the neceſſity of that refuſal very
difficult and cruel: for neceſſary it was, or I
ſhould have been one of the meaneſt and
baſeſt of mankind to have voluntarily laid my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under an obligation to a man who had
betrayed me.</p>
                  <p>I did my duty, though not without reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
I wrote immediately to General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and in the moſt civil and reſpectful
manner poſſible, without giving an abſolute
refuſal, excuſing myſelf from accepting the
penſion for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Now, Mr. Hume had been the only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiator
of this affair, nay the only perſon
who had ſpoke of it. Yet I not only did not
give him any anſwer, though it was he who
wrote to me on the ſubject, but did not even
ſo much as mention him in my letter to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Conway. This was the third ſlap of
the face I gave my patron; which if he does
not feel, it is certainly his own fault, he can
feel nothing.</p>
                  <p>My letter was not clear, nor could it be ſo
to General Conway, who did not know the
motives of my refuſal; but it was very plain
to Mr. Hume, who knew them but too well.
He pretended nevertheleſs to be deceived as
well with regard to the cauſe of my diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
as to that of my declining the penſion;
and, in a letter he wrote me on the occaſion,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0564000300:75"/>
gave me to underſtand that the king's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
might be continued towards me, if I
ſhould reconſider the affair of the penſion.
In a word he ſeemed determined, at all
events, to remain ſtill my patron, in ſpite of
my teeth. You will imagine, Sir, he did
not expect my anſwer; and he had none.
Much about this time, for I do not know
exactly the date, nor is ſuch preciſion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
appeared a letter, from Mr. de Voltaire
to me, with an Engliſh tranſlation, which ſtill
improved on the original. The noble object
of this ingenious performance, was to draw on
me the hatred and contempt of the people,
among whom I was come to reſide. I made
not the leaſt doubt that my dear patron was
one of the inſtruments of its publication;
particularly when I ſaw that the writer, in
endeavouring to alienate from me thoſe who
might render my life agreeable, had omitted
the name of him who brought me over.
He doubtleſs knew that it was ſuperfluous,
and that with regard to him, nothing more
was neceſſary to be ſaid. The omiſſion of
his name, ſo impoliticly forgot in this letter,
recalled to my mind what Tacitus ſays of
the picture of Brutus, omitted in a funeral
ſolemnity, viz. that every body took notice
of it, particularly becauſe it was not there.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hume was not mentioned; but he
lives and converſes with people that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0564000300:76"/>
It is well known his friends are all
my enemies; there are abroad ſuch people
as Tronchin, d'Alembert, and Voltaire<note n="*" place="bottom">I have never been ſo happy as to meet with Mr. de Voltaire; he only did me the honour to write me a letter about three years ago. As to Mr. Tronchin, I never ſaw him in my life, nor ever had any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him.

                        <p>Mr. Rouſſeau, ſeeing the letter addreſſed to him in the name of Voltaire advertiſed in the public papers, wrote to Mr. Davenport, who was then in London, to deſire he would bring it him. I told Mr. Davenport that the printed copy was very faulty, but that I would aſk of Lord Littleton a manuſcript copy, which was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. This is ſufficient to make Mr. Rouſſeau conclude that Lord Littleton is his mortal enemy, and my inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend; and that we are in a conſpiracy againſt him.

What do they know of me, except that I am
unhappy, and a friend to their friend Hume?
What can he have ſaid to them, for it is
only through him they know any thing of
me? I can very well imagine that, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the part he has to play, he does not
unmaſk himſelf to every body; for then he
would be diſguiſed to no body. I can very

any one diſcover the clue that hath been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled
ſince my arrival in London, and it
will eaſily be ſeen whether Mr. Hume does
not hold the principal thread.
At length the moment arrived in which
it was thought proper to ſtrike the great
blow; the effect of which was prepared for,
by a freſh, ſatirical piece, put in the papers<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I have never ſeen this piece, neither before nor after its publication; nor has it come to the knowlege of any body to whom I have ſpoken of it. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0564000300:78"/>
Had there remained in me the leaſt doubt,
it would have been impoſſible to have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
it after peruſing this piece; as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
facts unknown to any body but Mr.
Hume; exaggerated, it is true, in order to
render them odious to the public.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, in this paper, that my door was
opened to the rich, and ſhut to the poor.
Pray who knows when my door was open
or ſhut, except Mr. Hume, with whom I
lived, and by whom every body was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
that I ſaw? I will except one great
perſonage, whom I gladly received without
knowing him, and whom I ſhould ſtill have
more gladly received if I had known him.
It was Mr. Hume who told me his name,
when he was gone; on which information,
I was really chagrined that, as he deigned
to mount up two pair of ſtairs, he was not
received in the firſt floor. As to the poor, I
have nothing to ſay about the matter. I was
conſtantly deſirous of ſeeing leſs company;
but as I was unwilling to diſpleaſe any one,
I ſuffered myſelf to be directed in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
altogether by Mr. Hume, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to receive every body he introduced
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0564000300:79"/>
as well as I could, without diſtinction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rich or poor. It is ſaid in the ſame
piece, that I received my relations very
coldly, <hi>not to ſay any thing worſe.</hi> This
general charge relates to my having once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with ſome indifference the only rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have, out of Geneva, and that in the
preſence of Mr. Hume<note n="*" place="bottom">I was not preſent when Mr. Rouſſeau received his couſin: I only juſt ſaw them afterwards together for about a minute on the terrace in Bucking ham-ſtreet.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. It muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be either Mr. Hume or this relation
who furniſhed that piece of intelligence.
Now, my couſin, whom I have always
known for a friendly relation, and a worthy
man, is incapable of furniſhing materials for
public ſatires againſt me. Add to this, that
his ſituation in life confining him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of perſons in trade, he has no
connection with men of letters, or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph-writers,
and ſtill leſs with ſatiriſts
and libellers. So that the article could not
come from him. At the worſt, can I help
imagining that Mr. Hume muſt have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to take advantage of what he ſaid,
and conſtrued it in favour of his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
It is not improper to add, that after
my rupture with Mr. Hume, I wrote an
account of it to my couſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0564000300:80"/>
In fine, it is ſaid in the ſame paper, that
I am apt to change my friends. No great
ſubtlety is neceſſary to comprehend what
this reflection is preparative to.</p>
                  <p>But let us diſtinguiſh facts. I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſome very valuable and ſolid friends
for twenty-five to thirty years. I have
others whoſe friendſhip is of a later date,
but no leſs valuable, and which if I live, I
may preſerve ſtill longer. I have not found,
indeed, the ſame ſecurity in general among
thoſe friendſhips I have made with men of
letters. I have for this reaſon ſometimes
changed them, and ſhall always change
them, when they appear ſuſpicious; for I
am determined never to have friends by way
of ceremony; I have them only with a view
to ſhew them my affection.</p>
                  <p>If ever I was fully and clearly convinced
of any thing, I am ſo convinced that Mr.
Hume furniſhed the materials for the above
paper.</p>
                  <p>But what is ſtill more, I have not only
that abſolute conviction, but it is very clear
to me that Mr. Hume intended I ſhould:
For how can it be ſuppoſed that a man of
his ſubtlety ſhould be ſo imprudent as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelf thus, if he had not intended
it? What was his deſign in it? Nothing
is more clear than this. It was to raiſe my
reſentment to the higheſt pitch, that he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0564000300:81"/>
might ſtrike the blow he was preparing to
give me with greater eclat. He knew he
had nothing more to do than to put me in a
paſſion, and I ſhould be guilty of a number
of abſurdities. We are now arrived at the
critical moment which is to ſhew whether
he reaſoned well or ill.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary to have all the preſence of
mind, all the phlegm and reſolution of Mr.
Hume, to be able to take the part he hath
taken, after all that has paſſed between us.
In the embarraſſment I was under, in writing
to General Conway, I could make uſe only
of obſcure expreſſions; to which Mr. Hume,
in quality of my friend, gave what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
he pleaſed. Suppoſing therefore,
for he knew very well to the contrary, that
it was the circumſtance of ſecrecy which
gave me uneaſineſs, he obtained the promiſe
of the General to endeavour to remove it:
but before any thing was done, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
neceſſary to know whether I would
accept of the penſion without that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in order not to expoſe his Majeſty to a
ſecond refuſal.</p>
                  <p>This was the deciſive moment, the end
and object of all his labours. An anſwer
was required; he would have it. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
effectually indeed my neglect of it, he
ſent to Mr. Davenport a duplicate of his
letter to me; and, not content with this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0564000300:82"/>
precaution, wrote me word, in another
billet, that he could not poſſibly ſtay any
longer in London to ſerve me. I was giddy
with amazement, on reading this note. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in my life did I meet with any thing ſo
unaccountable.</p>
                  <p>At length he obtained from me the ſo
much deſired anſwer, and began preſently to
triumph. In writing to Mr. Davenport, he
treated me as a monſter of brutality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
But he wanted to do ſtill more.
He thinks his meaſures well taken; no
proof can be made to appear againſt him.
He demands an explanation; he ſhall have
it, and here it is.</p>
                  <p>That laſt ſtroke was a maſter-piece. He
himſelf proves every thing, and that beyond
reply.</p>
                  <p>I will ſuppoſe, though by way of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
that my complaints againſt Mr.
Hume never reached his ears; that he knew
nothing of them; but was as perfectly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
as if he had held no cabal with thoſe
who are acquainted with them, but had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
all the while in China<note n="*" place="bottom">How was it poſſible for me to gueſs at ſuch chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical ſuſpicions? Mr. Davenport, the only perſon of my acquaintance who then ſaw Mr. Rouſſeau, aſſures me, that he was perfectly ignorant of them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>. Yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
paſſing directly between us; the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0564000300:83"/>
laſt ſtriking words, which I ſaid to him in
London; the letter which followed replete
with fears and anxiety; my perſevering ſilence
ſtill more expreſſive than words; my public
and bitter complaints with regard to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Mr. d'Alembert; my letter to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State, who did not write to me,
in anſwer to that which Mr. Hume wrote to
me himſelf, and in which I did not mention
him; and in fine my refuſal, without deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to addreſs myſelf to him, to acquieſce in
an affair which he had managed in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
with my own privity, and without any
oppoſition on my part: all this muſt have
ſpoken in a very forcible manner, I will not
ſay to any perſon of the leaſt ſenſibility, but
to every man of common ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Strange that, after I had ceaſed to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond
with him for three months, when I
had made no anſwer to any one of his letters,
however important the ſubject of it, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with both public and private marks
of that affliction which his infidelity gave me;
a man of ſo enlightened an underſtanding,
of ſo penetrating a genius by nature, and ſo
dull by deſign, ſhould ſee nothing, hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
feel nothing, be moved at nothing;
but, without one word of complaint, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
or explanation, continue to give me
the moſt preſſing marks of his good will to
ſerve me, in ſpite of myſelf! He wrote to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0564000300:84"/>
me affectionately, that he could not ſtay
any longer in London to do me ſervice, as if
we had agreed that he ſhould ſtay there for
that purpoſe! This blindneſs, this inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
this perſeverance, are not in nature;
they muſt be accounted for, therefore, from
other motives. Let us ſet this behaviour in a
ſtill clearer light; for this is the deciſive point.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hume muſt neceſſarily have acted in
this affair, either as one of the firſt or laſt of
mankind. There is no medium. It remains
to determine which of the two it hath been.</p>
                  <p>Could Mr. Hume, after ſo many inſtances
of diſdain on my part, have ſtill the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generoſity as to perſevere ſincerely to
ſerve me? He knew it was impoſſible for me
to accept his good offices, ſo long as I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for him ſuch ſentiments as I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
He had himſelf avoided an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
So that to ſerve me without juſtifying
himſelf, would have been to render his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
uſeleſs; this therefore was no genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
If he ſuppoſed that in ſuch circumſtances
I ſhould have accepted his ſervices, he muſt
have ſuppoſed me to have been an infamous
ſcoundrel. It was then in behalf of a man
whom he ſuppoſed to be a ſcoundrel, that
he ſo warmly ſolicited a penſion from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.
Can any thing be ſuppoſed more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0564000300:85"/>
But let it be ſuppoſed that Mr. Hume,
conſtantly purſuing his plan, ſhould only
have ſaid to himſelf, This is the moment for
its execution; for, by preſſing Rouſſeau to
accept the penſion, he will be reduced either
to accept or refuſe it. If he accepts it, with
the proofs I have in hand againſt him, I ſhall
be able compleatly to diſgrace him: if he
refuſes, after having accepted it, he will have
no pretext, but muſt give a reaſon for ſuch
refuſal. This is what I expect; if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
me he is ruined.</p>
                  <p>If, I ſay, Mr. Hume reaſoned with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in this manner, he did what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with his plan, and in that caſe very
natural; indeed this is the only way in which
his conduct in this affair can be explained,
for upon any other ſuppoſition it is inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:
if this be not demonſtrable, nothing
ever was ſo. The critical ſituation to which
he had now reduced me, recalled ſtrongly to
my mind the four words I mentioned above;
and which I heard him ſay and repeat, at a
time when I did not comprehend their full
force. It was the firſt night after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from Paris. We ſlept in the ſame
chamber, when, during the night, I heard
him ſeveral times cry out with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
in the French language, <hi>Je tiens
J. J. Rouſſeau.</hi> [I have you, Rouſſeau.]
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0564000300:86"/>
I know not whether he was awake or
aſleep<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot anſwer for every thing I may ſay in my ſleep, and much leſs am I conſcious whether or not I dream in French. But pray, as Mr. Rouſſeau did not know whether I was aſleep or awake, when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced thoſe terrible words, with ſuch a terrible voice, how is he certain that he himſelf was well awake when he heard them? <bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>The expreſſion was remarkable, coming
from a man who is too well acquainted with
the French language, to be miſtaken with
regard to the force or choice of words. I took
thoſe words however, and I could not then
take them otherwiſe than in a favourable
ſenſe: notwithſtanding the tone of voice in
which they were ſpoken, was ſtill leſs favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than the expreſſion. It is indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for me to give any idea of it; but it
correſponds exactly with thoſe terrible looks
I have before mentioned. At every repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them I was ſeized with a ſhuddering,
a kind of horror I could not reſiſt; though a
moment's recollection reſtored me, and made
me ſmile at my terror. The next day all
this was ſo perfectly obliterated, that I did
not even once think of it during my ſtay in
London, and its neighbourhood. It was not
till my arrival in this place, that ſo many
things have contributed to recall theſe words
to mind; and indeed recall them every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0564000300:87"/>
Theſe words, the tone of which dwells on
my heart, as if I had but juſt heard them;
thoſe long and fatal looks ſo frequently caſt
on me; the patting me on the back, with
the repetition of <hi>O, my dear Sir,</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to my ſuſpicions of his being a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
all this affects me to ſuch a degree,
after what preceded, that this recollection,
had I no other, would be ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any reconciliation or return of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between us; not a night indeed paſſes
over my head, but I think I hear, <hi>Rouſſeau,</hi>
                     <hi>I have you,</hi> ring in my ears as if he had
juſt pronounced them.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Mr. Hume, I know you <hi>have me</hi>;
but that only by mere externals: you have
me in the public opinion and judgment of
mankind. You have my reputation, and
perhaps my ſecurity, to do with as you will.
The general prepoſſeſſion is in your favour;
it will be very eaſy for you to make me paſs
for the monſter you have begun to repreſent
me; and I already ſee the barbarous exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my implacable enemies. The public
will no longer ſpare me. Without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
examination, every body is on the ſide
of thoſe who have conferred favours; becauſe
each is deſirous to attract the ſame good
offices, by diſplaying a ſenſibility of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
I foreſee readily the conſequences
of all this, particularly in the country to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0564000300:88"/>
which you have conducted me; and where,
being without friends and an utter ſtranger
to every body, I lie almoſt entirely at your
mercy. The ſenſible part of mankind, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
will comprehend that I muſt be ſo far
from ſeeking this affair, that nothing more
diſagreeable or terrible could poſſibly have
happened to me in my preſent ſituation.
They will perceive that nothing but my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
averſion to all kind of falſhood, and
the poſſibility of my profeſſing a regard for a
perſon who had forfeited it, could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
my diſſimulation, at a time when it
was on ſo many accounts my intereſt. But
the ſenſible part of mankind are few, nor do
they make the greateſt noiſe in the world.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Mr. Hume, you <hi>have me</hi> by all the
ties of this life; but you have no power over
my probity or my fortitude, which, being
independent either of you or of mankind, I
will preſerve in ſpite of you. Think not to
frighten me with the fortune that awaits me.
I know the opinions of mankind; I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to their injuſtice, and have learned
to care little about it. If you have taken
your reſolution, as I have reaſon to believe
you have, be aſſured mine is taken alſo. I
am feeble indeed in body, but never poſſeſſed
greater ſtrength of mind.</p>
                  <p>Mankind may ſay and do what they will,
it is of little conſequence to me. What is of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0564000300:89"/>
conſequence, however, is, that I ſhould end
as I have begun; that I ſhould continue to
preſerve my ingenuouſneſs and integrity to
the end, whatever may happen; and that I
ſhould have no cauſe to reproach myſelf
either with meanneſs in adverſity, or inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in proſperity. Whatever diſgrace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
or misfortune threatens me, I am
ready to meet them. Though I am to be
pitied, I am much leſs ſo than you, and all
the revenge I ſhall take on you, is, to leave
you the tormenting conſciouſneſs of being
obliged, in ſpite of yourſelf, to have a reſpect
for the unfortunate perſon you have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                  <p>In cloſing this letter, I am ſurprized at
my having been able to write it. If it were
poſſible to die with grief, every line was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to kill me with ſorrow. Every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of the affair is equally incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.
Such conduct as yours hath been,
is not in nature: it is contradictory to itſelf,
and yet it is demonſtrable to me that it has
been ſuch as I conceive. On each ſide of me
there is a bottomleſs abyſs! and I am loſt in
one or the other.</p>
                  <p>If you are guilty, I am the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
of mankind; if you are innocent, I
am the moſt culpable<note n="*" place="bottom">And does it depend on an <hi>if,</hi> after all Mr. R's poſitive conviction, and abſolute demonſtrations? <bibl>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0564000300:90"/>
me deſire to be that contemptible object.
Yes, the ſituation to which you ſee me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
proſtrate at your feet, crying out for
mercy, and doing every thing to obtain it;
publiſhing aloud my own unworthineſs, and
paying the moſt explicit homage to your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
would be a ſtate of joy and cordial ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
after the grievous ſtate of reſtraint
and mortification into which you have plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me. I have but a word more to ſay. If
you are guilty, write to me no more; it
would be ſuperfluous, for certainly you could
not deceive me. If you are innocent, juſtify
yourſelf. I know my duty, I love, and
ſhall always love it, however difficult and
ſevere. There is no ſtate of abjection that a
heart, not formed for it, may not recover
from. Once again, I ſay, if you are innocent,
deign to juſtify yourſelf; if you are not,
adieu for ever.</p>

            <p>I heſitated ſome time whether I ſhould
make any reply to this ſtrange memorial.
At length I determined to write to Mr. Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau
the following letter.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I SHALL only anſwer one article of
your long letter: it is that which regards
the converſation between us the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your departure. Mr. Davenport had
imagined a good natured artifice, to make you
believe that a retour chaiſe had offered for
Wooton; and I believe he made an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
be put in the papers, in order the
better to deceive you. His purpoſe only was
to ſave you ſome expences in the journey,
which I thought a laudable project; though
I had no hand either in contriving or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
it. You entertained, however, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
of his deſign, while we were ſitting
alone by my fire-side; and you reproached
me with concurring in it. I endeavoured to
pacify you, and to divert the diſcourſe; but
to no purpoſe. You ſat ſullen, and was
either ſilent, or made me very peeviſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.
At laſt you roſe up, and took a turn
or two about the room; when all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and to my great ſurpriſe, you clapped
yourſelf on my knee, threw your arms about
my neck, kiſſed me with ſeeming ardour,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0564000300:92"/>
and bedewed my face with tears. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<q rend="inline">"My dear friend, can you ever
pardon this folly! After all the pains you
have taken to ſerve me, after the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
inſtances of friendſhip you have
given me, here I reward you with this ill
humour and ſullenneſs. But your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of me will be a new inſtance of
your friendſhip; and I hope you will find
at bottom, that my heart is not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was very much affected, I own; and,
I believe, there paſſed a very tender ſcene
between us. You added, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
that though I had many better titles
to recommend me to poſterity, yet perhaps
my uncommon attachment and friendſhip to
a poor unhappy perſecuted man, would not
altogether be overlooked.</p>
                  <p>This incident, Sir, was ſomewhat remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and it is impoſſible that either you or I
could ſo ſoon have forgot it. But you have
had the aſſurance to tell me the ſtory twice
in a manner ſo different, or rather ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
that when I perſiſt, as I do, in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
it neceſſarily follows, that either you
or I are a liar. You imagine, perhaps, that
becauſe the incident paſſed privately without
a witneſs, the queſtion will lie between the
credibility of your aſſertion and of mine. But
you ſhall not have this advantage or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0564000300:93"/>
which ever you are pleaſed to term
it. I ſhall produce againſt you other proofs,
which will put the matter beyond controverſy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, You are not aware, that I have a
letter under your hand, which is totally irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable
with your account, and confirms
mine<note n="*" place="bottom">That of the 22d of March, which is entirely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; and proves that Mr. Rouſſeau had never, till that moment, entertained, or at leaſt diſcovered, the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion againſt me. There is alſo in the ſame letter, a peeviſh paſſage about the hire of a chaiſe.
<bibl>Mr. HUME.</bibl>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I told the ſtory the next day, or
the day after, to Mr. Davenport, with a
friendly view of preventing any ſuch good
natured artifices for the future. He ſurely
remembers it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As I thought the ſtory much to
your honour, I told it to ſeveral of my friends
here. I even wrote it to Mde. de Boufflers
at Paris. I believe no one will imagine, that
I was preparing before-hand an apology, in
caſe of a rupture with you; which, of all
human events, I ſhould then have thought
the moſt incredible, eſpecially as we were
ſeparated almoſt for ever, and I ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to render you the moſt eſſential ſervices.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſtory, as I tell it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
and rational: there is not common
ſenſe in your account. What! becauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0564000300:94"/>
ſometimes, when abſent in thought, I have
a fixed look or ſtare, you ſuſpect me to be a
traitor, and you have the aſſurance to tell
me of ſuch black and ridiculous ſuſpicions!
Are not moſt ſtudious men (and many of
them more than I) ſubject to ſuch reveries or
fits of abſence, without being expoſed to
ſuch ſuſpicions? You do not even pretend
that, before you left London, you had any
other ſolid grounds of ſuſpicion againſt me.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall enter into no detail with regard to
your letter: the other articles of it are as much
without foundation as you yourſelf know
this to be. I ſhall only add, in general, that
I enjoyed about a month ago an uncommon
pleaſure, when I reflected, that through
many difficulties, and by moſt aſſiduous care
and pains, I had, beyond my moſt ſanguine
expectations, provided for your repoſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and fortune. But I ſoon felt a very
ſenſible uneaſineſs when I found that you had
wantonly and voluntarily thrown away all
theſe advantages, and was become the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
enemy of your own repoſe, fortune,
and honour: I cannot be ſurprized after this
that you are my enemy. Adieu, and for
ever. I am, Sir, yours.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0564000300:95"/>

                  <p>I CANNOT be preciſe as to the time of
my writing the King of Pruſſia's letter, but
I do aſſure you, with the utmoſt truth, that
it was ſeveral days before you left Paris, and
before Rouſſeau's arrival there, of which I
can give you a ſtrong proof; for I not only
ſuppreſſed the letter while you ſtaid there,
out of delicacy to you, but it was the reaſon
why, out of delicacy to myſelf, I did not go
to ſee him, as you often propoſed to me;
thinking it wrong to go and make a cordial
viſit to a man, with a letter in my pocket to
laugh at him. You are at full liberty, dear
Sir, to make uſe of what I ſay in your juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
either to Rouſſeau or any body elſe.
I ſhould be very ſorry to have you blamed
on my account: I have a hearty contempted
of Rouſſeau, and am perfectly indifferent
what any body thinks of the matter. If
there is any fault, which I am far from
thinking, let it lie on me. No parts can
hinder my laughing at their poſſeſſor, if he

is a mountebank. If he has a bad and moſt
ungrateful heart, as Rouſſeau has ſhown in
your caſe, into the bargain, he will have my
ſcorn likewiſe, as he will of all good and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

            <p>Thus I have given a narrative, as conciſe
as poſſible, of this extraordinary affair, which
I am told has very much attracted the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the public, and which contains more
unexpected incidents than any other in which
I was ever engaged. The perſons to whom
I have ſhown the original papers which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticate
the whole, have differed very much
in their opinion, as well of the uſe I ought
to make of them as of Mr. Rouſſeau's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſentiments and ſtate of mind. Some of
them have maintained, that he is altogether
inſincere in his quarrel with me, and his
opinion of my guilt, and that the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from that exceſſive pride which forms
the baſis of his character, and which leads
him both to ſeek the eclat of refuſing the
King of England's bounty, and to ſhake off
the intolerable burthen of an obligation to
me, by every sacrifice of honour, truth, and
friendſhip, as well as of intereſt. They
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0564000300:97"/>
found their ſentiments on the abſurdity of
that firſt ſuppoſition on which he grounds
his anger, viz. that Mr. Walpole's letter,
which he knew had been every where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
both in Paris and London, was given
to the preſs by me; and as this ſuppoſition
is contrary to common ſenſe on the one hand,
and not ſupported even by the pretence of
the ſlighteſt probability on the other, they
conclude, that it never had any weight even
with the perſon himſelf who lays hold of it.
They confirm their ſentiments by the number
of fictions and lies, which he employs to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
his anger; fictions with regard to points,
in which it is impoſſible for him to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
They alſo remark his real chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and gaiety, amidſt the deep melancholy
with which he pretended to be oppreſſed.
Not to mention the abſurd reaſoning which
runs through the whole, and on which it is
impoſſible for any man to reſt his conviction;
and though a very important intereſt is here
abandoned, yet money is not univerſally the
chief object with mankind; vanity weighs
farther with ſome men, particularly with this
philoſopher; and the very oftentation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
a penſion from the King of England,
an oſtentation which, with regard to other
Princes, he has often ſought, might be of
itſelf a ſufficient motive for his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0564000300:98"/>
There are others of my friends, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
this whole affair in a more compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
light, and conſider Mr. Rouſſeau as
an object rather of pity than of anger.
They ſuppoſe the ſame domineering pride
and ingratitude to be the baſis of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
but they are alſo willing to believe,
that his brain has received a ſenſible ſhock,
and that his judgment, ſet afloat, is carried to
every ſide, as it is puſhed by the current of
his humours and of his paſſions. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
of his belief is no proof of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity.
He imagines himſelf the ſole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
being in the univerſe: he fancies all
mankind to be in a combination againſt him:
his greateſt benefactor, as hurting him moſt,
is the chief object of his animoſity: and
though he ſupports all his whimſies by
lies and fictions, this is ſo frequent a caſe
with wicked men, who are in that middle
ſtate between ſober reaſon and total frenzy,
that it needs give no ſurprize to any body.</p>
            <p>I own that I am much inclined to this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinion; though, at the ſame time, I
queſtion whether, in any period of his life,
Mr. Rouſſeau was ever more in his ſenſes
than he is at preſent. The former brilliancy
of his genius, and his great talents for
writing, are no proof of the contrary. It
is an old remark, that great wits are near
allied to madneſs; and even in thoſe frantic
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0564000300:99"/>
letters which he has wrote to me, there are
evidently ſtrong traces of his wonted genius
and eloquence. He has frequently told me,
that he was compoſing his memoirs, in
which juſtice ſhould be done to his own
character, to that of his friends, and to that
of his enemies; and as Mr. Davenport in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
me that ſince his retreat into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he has been much employed in writing,
I have reaſon to conclude that he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
finiſhing that undertaking. Nothing
could be more unexpected to me than my
paſſing ſo ſuddenly from the claſs of his
friends to that of his enemies; but this
tranſition being made, I muſt expect to be
treated accordingly; and I own that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
gave me ſome anxiety<note n="*" place="bottom">In his letter of the 22d of March, he flatters me indirectly with the figure I am to make in his Memoirs; in that of the 23d of June, he threatens me. Theſe are proofs how much he is in earneſt.</note>. A work
of this nature, both from the celebrity of
the perſon, and the ſtrokes of eloquence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed,
would certainly attract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world; and it might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
either after my death, or after that
of the author. In the former caſe, there
would be no body who could tell the ſtory,
or juſtify my memory. In the latter, my
apology, wrote in oppoſition to a dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0564000300:100"/>
would loſe a great deal of its authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
For this reaſon, I have at preſent col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the whole ſtory into one Narrative,
that I may ſhow it to my friends, and at any
time have it in my power to make whatever
uſe of it they and I ſhould think proper. I
am, and always have been, ſuch a lover of
peace, that nothing but neceſſity, or very
forcible reaſons, could have obliged me to
give it to the public.</p>

relating to Mr. Walpole's Letter.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Addreſſed to the French Editors.</head>
                  <p>IT is with the greateſt ſurprize I learn,
from Mr. Hume, that Mr. Rouſſeau ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
me of being the author of the ironical
letter addreſſed to him, in the public papers,
under the name of the King of Pruſſia.
Every body knows, both at Paris and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
that ſuch letter was written by Mr.
Walpole; nor does he diſown it. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleges
only that he was a little aſſiſted
in regard to the ſtile, by a perſon he does
not name, and whom perhaps he ought to
name. As to my part, on whom the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
ſuſpicions have fallen in this affair, I am
not at all acquainted with Mr. Walpole:
I don't even believe I ever ſpoke to him;
having only happened to meet once occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally
on a viſit.—I have not only had not
the leaſt to do, either directly or indirectly,
with the letter in queſtion, but could mention
above an hundred perſons, among the friends
as well as enemies of Mr. Rouſſeau, who
have heard me greatly diſapprove of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as I ſaid, we ought not to ridicule the
unfortunate, eſpecially when they do us no
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0564000300:102"/>
harm. Beſides, my reſpect for the King of
Pruſſia, and the acknowledgments I owe
him, might, I ſhould have thought, have
perſuaded Mr. Rouſſeau, that I ſhould not
have taken ſuch a liberty with the name of
that prince, even tho' in pleaſantry.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall add, that I never was an
enemy to Mr. Rouſſeau, either open or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
as he pretends; and I defy him to
produce the leaſt proof of my having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to injure him in any ſhape what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
I can prove to the contrary, by the
moſt reſpectable witneſſes, that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
endeavoured to oblige him, whenever
it lay in my power.</p>
                  <p>As to my pretended <hi>ſecret correſpondence</hi>
with Mr. Hume, it is very certain, that we
did not begin to write to each other till about
five or ſix months after his departure, on
occaſion of the quarrel ariſen between him
and Mr. Rouſſeau, and into which the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thought proper unneceſſarily to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
me.</p>
                  <p>I thought this declaration neceſſary, for
my own ſake, as well as for the ſake of
truth, and in regard to the ſituation of Mr.
Rouſſeau: I ſincerely lament his having ſo
little confidence in the probity of mankind,
and particularly in that of Mr. Hume.</p>
