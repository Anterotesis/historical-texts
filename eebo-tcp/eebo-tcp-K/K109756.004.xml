            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IF the Nightingale be the ſongſter of the grove, the Canary
Finch is the muſician of the chamber. The melody of the former is derived
from Nature alone, that of the latter is directed and improved by our
inſtructions. With a weaker voice, with leſs extent of modulation, with
leſs variety of notes, the Canary Finch has a finer ear, greater facility of
imitation<note n="†" place="bottom"> The Canary learns to ſpeak, and
articulate many little names very diſtinctly. . . . By means of a flageolet,
it can acquire two or three airs, which it chants in their proper tone, always
keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due time, &amp;c.

and, as the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of animals depend principally on the quality of their
perceptions, this delicate bird, alive to every impreſſion, becomes alſo
more ſocial, more gentle; forms acquaintance, and even ſhews
attachment<note n="*" place="bottom">It becomes ſo familiar and ſo fond of
careſſing, that a thouſand and a thouſand times it comes to kiſs and
bill its maſter, and never ſails to anſwer his call.

Hervieux.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </note>. Its careſſes are amiable, its little pets are
innocent, and its anger neither hurts nor offends. Its habits too approach
nearer to our own; it feeds on grain, like the other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic birds; it is
more eaſily bred than the Nightingale, which lives only on fleſh and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and which requires its meals to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely prepared. Its
education is attended alſo with greater ſucceſs; it readily lays aſide
the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of its native airs to adopt the harmony of our voices and
inſtruments; it eagerly follows the notes, and improves and heightens their
delicacy. The Nightingale, proud of its independent warble, ſeems deſirous
to preſerve its purity; at leaſt, he ſlights our muſic, and can hardly
be brought to learn a few ſongs. The Canary Finch prattles or whiſtles; but
the Nightingale deſpiſes what he deems the perverſion of his talents, and
perpetually recurs to the rich beauties of Nature. <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1084600104:16"/> His
ever-varied ſong can never be altered by man; that of the Canary Finch is
more pliant, and can be modelled by our taſte. The one therefore contributes
more than the other to the comforts of ſociety; the Canary Finch ſings at
all times, recreates our ſpirits in the gloomieſt weather, and even adds to
our happineſs; it amuſes all young people, and is the delight of the
recluſe; it relieves the languors of the cloiſter, and infuſes
cheerfulneſs into innocent and captive minds; and its little loves, which are
manifeſt when it breeds, have a thouſand and a thouſand times awakened
the tenderneſs of feeling hearts. It is as uſeful, as the Vulture is
pernicious.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1084600104:17"/> more ruſtic, and may be regarded as the wild branches of
a poliſhed ſtem. All the three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix in the ſtate of captivity; but
in the range of nature, each propagates in its peculiar climate. They are
therefore permanent varieties, and ought to be diſtinguiſhed by ſeparate
names. The largeſt was called <hi>Cinit,</hi> or <hi>Cini,</hi> in the time

Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and probably in all climates of that temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature. Some years,
however, it is very rare in the ſouthern provinces of France, and
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at Marſeilles. Its ſong is pleaſant and varied. The female
is inferior to the male both in the charms of its notes and in the beauty of
its plumage. The ſhape, the colour, the voice, and the food of the Venturon
and of the Canary, are nearly the ſame; and the only difference is, 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1084600104:18"/> that the Italian bird is ſenſibly ſmaller, and its
warble neither ſo clear nor ſo melodious.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cini,</hi> or Green Bird of Provence, is larger than the
Venturon, and its tones are much fuller. It is diſtinguiſhed by the beauty
of its colours, the loudneſs of its ſong, and the variety of its notes. The
female, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther larger than the male, and has fewer yellow feathers,
chants not like its mate, and anſwers only in monoſyllables. It feeds on
the ſmalleſt ſeeds it can find in the field; lives long in a cage,
ſeems fond of lodging with a gold-finch, whoſe accents it ſeems
attentively to hear, and adopt, to vary its own warble. It occurs not only in
Provence, but alſo in Dauphiné, in the Lyonnois<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p> I have ſeen in the country in Bugey, and near Lyons,
birds very like the Canary Finches, and they were called <hi>Signis</hi> or
<hi>Cignis.</hi> I have alſo ſeen them at Geneva in cages, and their ſong

                        <q rend="inline">"The German Serins are much commended; they
excel the Canary Finches by their beauty and their ſong. They are not
Inclined to grow fat; the force and extent of their warble prevent, it is

them, and having an eaſterly aſpect; they hatch thrice a-year, from the

along the ſides of the rivers, and its neſt is lined with hair, and caſed
with moſs. This bird, which is pretty common in the vicinity of Marſeilles,
and in the ſouth of France as high as Burgundy, is unfrequent in the northern
provinces. Lottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſays it is only migratory in Lorraine.</p>
               <p>The prevailing colour of the Venturon as well as that of the
Cini, is a green yellow on the upper part of the body, and a yellow green on
the belly; but the Cini, larger than the Venturon, is diſtinguiſhed by the
brown colour which appears in longitudinal ſpots on the ſides of the body,
and in waves below<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>I ſhall here inſert an excellent deſcription of the
Cini, which M. Hebert ſent to me. 
<q rend="inline">"This bird is ſomewhat ſmaller than the
Canary Finch, which it much reſembles. It has preciſely the ſame plumage
with a kind of Canary called the <hi>Gray Canary,</hi> which is perhaps the
original bird, and the varieties are owing to domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tication. 
<p>"The fore-part of the head, the orbits of the eyes, the
under-part of the head, a ſort of collar, the breaſt and belly as far as
the toes, are of a jonquil-colour, with a tinge of green. The ſides of the
head, and the higher part of the wings, are mixed with green, jonquil, and
black. The back, and the reſt of the wings, are daſhed with green, gray,
and black. The rump is jonquil. The breaſt, though of a ſingle colour, is
waved. The ſpots ſcattered on the plumage of the Cini are not diſtinctly
marked, but run into each other; thoſe on the head are much finer, and like
points; on the two ſides of the breaſt, and under the belly parallel to the
wings, are ſpots or ſtreaks of black.</p> 
                           <p> "The tail is forked, conſiſting of twelve quills; the
wings are of the ſame colour with the back; the ends of the coverts at the
origin of the great quills, are ſlightly edged with a ſort of dull yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
the great quills and the tail are ſimilar, and of a brown ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to black,
with a ſlight edging of gray; the tail is ſhorter than that of the Canary
bird.</p> 
                           <p> "In general this bird is jonquil below, and variegated on
the back with different colours, in which the green predominates, though we
cannot aſſert that this is the ground colour; on the back not a ſingle
feather but is variegated with ſeveral colours.</p> 
                           <p> "The bill is pretty much like that of the Canary, but
rather ſhorter and ſmaller; the upper mandible is level with the crown of
the head, has little concavity, broader at its baſe, and ſcalloped near its
origin; the lower mandible is more concave, placed dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonally under the upper,
into which it is encaſed.</p> 
                           <p>"This Cini was only two inches and ſeven lines from the
top of the head to the origin of the tail, which was only one inch and ten
lines; the wings extend to the third of the tail; the legs are very ſlender;
the tarſus ſix lines long, and the toes near as much; the nails are not
regularly hooked."</p>

                  </note>; whereas in <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1084600104:20"/> our
climate, the common colour of the Canary is uniform, and of a citron-yellow on
all the body, and even on the belly: it is only the tips of the feathers
however that are tinged with that delicate hue, the reſt of them being
entirely white. The female is of a paler yellow than the male; but this
citron-colour verging more or leſs on white, which the Canary aſſumes in
our climate, is not the tint of its native climate, for it varies according to
the different tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 
<q rend="inline">"I have obſerved," ſays one of our moſt
intelligent naturaliſts, "that the Canary Finch, which becomes entirely white
in France, is in Teneriffe of almoſt as deep a gray as the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; this
change of colour is owing probably to the coldneſs of our climate."</q> The
colour can be varied alſo by the difference of food, by confinement, and
above all by the mixture of <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1084600104:21"/> breeds. In the beginning of

                  <p>"For thirty years paſt I have raiſed many of theſe ſmall
birds, and have paid particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to breeding them; I can therefore
from long obſervation aſſert the following facts. When we wiſh to pair
Canaries with Goldfinches, we muſt take the Goldfinches at ten or twelve days
old, and put them in the neſt with Canaries of the ſame age; we muſt
raiſe them together in the ſame volery, and accuſtom them to the ſame
food. It is uſual to lodge the male Goldfinches with the female Canaries, and
they aſſociate much more readily than if the female Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finches were
joined with the male Canaries. We may obſerve however, that the union is more
tardy, becauſe the Goldfinch is later in pairing than the Canary; on the
contrary, if the female Goldfinch be placed beſide the male Canary they
ſooner couple<note n="†" place="bottom">This proves (as we ſhall
afterwards obſerve) that the female is not ſo much ſtimulated to love by
nature, as rouſed by the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the male.</note>. To ſucceed we
muſt never admit the male Canary into the voleries where there are female
Canaries, for he would then prefer them to Goldfinches<note n="‡" place="bottom">Geſner ſays, that a Swiſs bird-catcher trying to pair a cock

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1084600104:24"/> "With regard to the union of the male
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary with the female Siſkin, I am certain that it ſucceeds well. I have
kept for nine years in my volery a female Siſkin, which never failed to make
three hatches annually for the firſt five years, though the number was
reduced to two in the four following years. I have other Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins which have
bred with the Canaries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being raiſed or kept ſeparately. We need
only leave the male or female Siſkin in the chamber with a good number of
Canaries, and we ſhall perceive them pair with the Canaries, at the ſame
time that theſe pair with each other; whereas, to ſucceed with the
Goldfinches, they muſt be ſhut up in a cage with the Canary, and every bird
of the ſame ſpecies muſt be excluded. The Siſkin lives as long as the
Canary, and eats the ſame food with much leſs reluctance than the
Goldfinch.</p> 
                  <p> "I have alſo put Linnets with Canaries; but there is ſeldom
ſucceſs, unleſs we lodge the male Linnet with the female Canary; for the
hen Linnet makes no neſt, but drops her eggs in the cage, and theſe are
generally addle. I have made the experiment with them, having placed them under
female Canaries, and frequently found that they did not hatch.</p> 
                  <p>"It is very difficult to pair Chaffinches and Yellow-hammers
with Canaries. I have kept for three years a female Yellow-hammer with a male
Canary, and it has laid only addle <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1084600104:25"/> eggs. This has alſo
been the caſe with the female Chaffinch; but when the female Canary is
covered by the male Chaffinch and Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer ſhe has prolific eggs."</p>
               </q>
               <p>From theſe facts, and ſome others which I have collected, it
appears that the Siſkin is the only bird of which the male and female
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate equally with thoſe of the male or female Canaries. The female
Canary alſo breeds rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with the Goldfinch; not ſo eaſily with the
cock Linnet; and even produces, though with more difficulty, under the male
Chaffinches, Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-hammers, and Sparrows; whereas the male Canaries cannot
impregnate the females of theſe laſt. Nature is therefore more uniform and
permanent in the male than in the female; in the former the characters are
deeply imprinted; in the latter, the qualities are modified by the influence of
external cauſes. In the few experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I have made on the union of
ſome contiguous ſpecies of quadrupeds, I obſerved that the ewe eaſily
bred under the he-goat; but that the ram could not propagate upon the
ſhe-goat. I have been told of an inſtance in which a ſtag covered a cow;
but the bull has been known to copulate with the hind. The mare breeds more
readily with the jack-aſs, than the ſhe-aſs with the ſtallion. In
general, mules par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more of the characters of the female than of the male,
whoſe features are more ſtrongly marked.—Theſe facts correſpond
with thoſe we <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1084600104:26"/> have mentioned with regard to the
croſs-breed of birds. It is evident that the female Canary is much more
related than the male to the ſpecies of the Yellow-hammer, of the Linnet, of
the Chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch, and of the Sparrow; ſince it breeds with all theſe, while
the male will not. I uſe the term <hi>will,</hi> for perhaps it is only from
a want of reſolution that the female yields to the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
thoſe of a different ſpecies: however, an examination of the products of
this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture affords concluſions that agree with all that I have ſaid
of the generation and develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of animals; and as the ſubject is
import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, I ſhall here ſtate the principal facts.</p>
               <p>The firſt variety which ſeems to conſtitute two diſtinct
families in the ſpecies, conſiſts of the variegated Canaries, and thoſe
whoſe plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is uniform. The white ſort, or the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citron, are never
variegated; only when the latter are four or five years old, the tips of the
wings and of the tail become white. The gray kind are not of an uniform colour;
ſome feathers are affected by different ſhades, and ſome individuals are
of a lighter or of a darker tinge. The agate is ſpread uniformly, though it
varies in the intenſity. The pink coloured are more ſimilar, the tint being
uniform, not only in different individuals, but in different parts of the
ſame individual. In thoſe which conſiſt of ſeveral colours, the
Yellow Jonquil ſort are varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with blackiſh, and are commonly black
on <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1084600104:27"/> the head. In ſome Canaries, the plumage is tinctured
with all the ſimple colours which we have mentioned; but the Yellow Jonquil
are the moſt variegated with black.</p>
               <p>When Canaries are paired of an uniform colour, that of their
young is alſo uniform. If both parents are gray, for inſtance, the progeny
is alſo commonly gray; and this is the caſe with the pink, with the white,
with the yellow, and with the agate. If the parents be of different colours,
the fruits of their commerce will have a richer plumage; and as the
combinations that can take place are numerous, an immenſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of tints
may be produced. But when the Canaries of an uniform colour are croſſed
with thoſe which are variegated, the changes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly multiplied,
and there is ſcarce any limit to the ſportive modifications. Nay, it often
happens that parents of an uniform colour have beautiful variegated offspring,
derived from the mixture of ſhades in themſelves or their progenitors<note n="*" place="bottom">To have beautiful birds, we muſt pair the flaxen
variegated male with a white-tailed yellow female; or at leaſt a variegated
male with a white-tailed flaxen female, or any other female that is
white-tailed, except only the gray. And when we want to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fine Jonquil,
we ſhould ſet a black variegated male with a white-tailed yellow female.

               <p>With reſpect to the intercourſe of the Canary with birds of
other ſpecies, I ſhall here ſtate the obſervations which I have
collected. Of all <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1084600104:28"/> the Canaries, the Cini or Green Canary
has the ſtrongeſt voice, and appears to be the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and the
moſt ardent in propagation; it is ſufficient for three female Canaries, and
while they are ſitting in the neſts, it ſupplies them and their young
with food. The Siſkin and the Goldfinch are neither ſo powerful nor ſo
aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a ſingle female Canary ſatisfies their appetite.</p>
               <p>The croſs-breed of the Cini, of the Siſkin, and of the
Goldfinch, with the hen Canary, are ſtronger than the Canaries, ſing
longer, and their notes are fuller and more ſonorous; but they are ſlower
in receiving inſtruction: for the moſt part, they whiſtle imperfectly,
and ſeldom one can be found that can repeat a ſingle air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete.</p>
               <p>When we wiſh to have a breed of the Goldfinch with the hen
Canary, the former ſhould be two years old, and the latter one, for the
Canary arrives ſooner at maturity. It will be better if both be reared
together, though that precaution is not abſolutely neceſſary; and the
Author of "the Treatiſe on Canaries" is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in aſſerting, that
the hen muſt never have had commerce with a male of her own ſpecies, and
that this would prevent her from receiving thoſe of a different kind. The
following fact is directly contrary to this opinion: 
<q rend="inline">"I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened," ſays Father Bougot, "to put
twelve Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries together, four males and eight females. <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1084600104:29"/>
Bad chickweed killed three of theſe males, and all the females loſt their
firſt hatch. In the ſtead of theſe Cock-Canaries, I thought of
ſubſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three male Goldfinches which I caught, and put them into the
volery in the beginning of May. I had, towards the end of July, two neſts of
young, which thrived as well as poſſible; and in the following year, I had
three hatches of each cock Goldfinch with the female Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. Theſe
commonly do not breed with the Goldfinch, except from the age of one to four;
while they continue prolific with their own males till eight or nine: and it is
only the variegated female that breeds with the Goldfinch after its fourth
year. We muſt never put the Goldfinch into a volery, for it demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes the
neſts, and breaks the eggs of the other birds."</q> It appears then that the
hen Canaries, though accuſtomed to the commerce of their own ſpecies,
liſten to the invitation of the male Goldfinches, and ſubmit without
reluctance to their embraces. The union is even as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive as with their
proper mates, ſince they have three hatches a-year with the Goldfinch. The
caſe is different in the intercourſe of the cock Linnet with the Canary,
there being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly but one hatch, and very ſeldom two in the year.</p>
               <p>The progeny of the Canaries with the Siſkins, with the
Goldfinches, &amp;c. are prolific, and can breed not only with both the
ſpecies from which <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1084600104:30"/> they ſprung, but likewiſe with
each other; and thus may perpetuate an endleſs variety<note n="*" place="bottom">Sprengel has made many obſervations with regard to the
croſs-breeds of the Canaries with other ſpecies, and particularly with the
Goldfinches; he has ſhewn that the progeny continued to propagate with each
other, and with the parent races. The proof which he has adduced is complete,
though before him theſe hybrids were conſidered as ſterile. 
<bibl>
                        <hi>Amuſemens Innocens.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                  </note>. We muſt
own, however, that the fruits of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture in theſe hybrids are far
from being ſo certain or ſo numerous as in the pure ſpecies; they
generally have only one hatch a-year, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom two, their eggs are often
addle, and the ſucceſs depends on many minute circumſtances, which it
would be impoſſible to obſerve, and ſtill leſs to deſcribe with
preciſion. It is ſaid, that in theſe there are always more males than
females. 
<q rend="inline">"A hen Canary (ſays Father Bougot) and a
Goldfinch have, in the ſame year at three different times, laid me nineteen
eggs, which all hatched, and of the young were only three females."</q> It
would be proper to aſcertain this fact by repeated obſervations. In the
pure breeds of ſeveral birds, as in the partridges, it has alſo been
remarked that the males exceed the females. The ſame remark applies to the
human race: in our climates, ſeventeen boys are born for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen girls. We
know not the preciſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the male and female partridges, but
that the former are more numerous than the latter we are certain, becauſe in
the pairing <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1084600104:31"/> ſeaſon, there are always cock birds that
want mates. It is likely, however, that ſixteen to three, as in the
croſs-breed of the Canary and Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch, is a greater inequality than ever
takes place in a pure breed. I have been told, that the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mules, got
between the aſs and the mare, exceed in number the he-mules; but I could
never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accurate information on that ſubject. Our buſineſs then is
to determine by obſervation the number of males and of females in the pure
race of the Canary, and afterwards to examine if that of the males be ſtill
greater in the croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breed of the Goldfinch and hen Canary. What diſpoſes
me to entertain this opinion is, that the character of the male is in general
more deeply impreſſed on the progeny, than that of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. Theſe
hybrids, which are ſtronger than the Canaries, and have a louder voice, are
alſo longer lived. But there is an obſervation which applies alike to all,
that the period of their lives is abridged by their ardour in propagation. A
cock Canary raiſed by itſelf, and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the female,
lives generally thirteen or fourteen years; and the croſs-breed of the
Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch will reach its eighteenth or nineteenth year. The croſs-breed of
the Siſkin, if kept apart from the females, live fifteen or ſixteen years.
Whereas the cock Canary, which has one or ſeveral females, ſeldom lives
longer than ten or eleven years; the croſs-breed of the Siſkin eleven 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1084600104:32"/> or twelve, and that of the Goldfinch fourteen or fifteen.
It is alſo neceſſary to part them from the females after the time of
hatching; that is, from the month of Auguſt to that of March; elſe the heat
of their paſſion would waſte them, and abridge their lives by two or
three years.</p>
               <p>To theſe remarks, which are all intereſting, we may
ſubjoin a general and more important obſervation, which may throw ſome
light on the generation of animals, and the developement of their different
parts. It has been conſtantly noticed in the copulation of the Canaries, both
with thoſe of their own ſpecies and with thoſe of other races, that the
offspring reſembled the father in the head, the tail, and the legs, and the
mother in the reſt of the body. The ſame has been obſerved in quadrupeds.
The mule got between the jack-aſs and the mare, has the thick body of the
former, and the ears, the tail, and the thin legs of the latter. It appears
therefore that, in the mixture of the two ſeminal liquors, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intimate
we ſuppoſe it to be, the organic molecules furniſhed by the female occupy
the centre of that living ſphere which increaſes in all dimenſions, and
that the molecules injected by the male ſurround and incloſe theſe; ſo
that the extremities of the body proceed more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the father than
from the mother. The ſkin, the hair, the colours, which may be conſidered
as the exterior of the body, retain moſt of the paternal impreſſions. In
the croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breed <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1084600104:33"/> which I obtained from the copulation of
the he-goat with the ewe, they all had, inſtead of a ſoft fleece, the
ſhaggy coat of the male. In the human ſpecies, we may generally perceive,
that the ſon reſembles the father more than the mother, in his legs, his
feet, and his hands; in his writing, in the quantity and colour oſ his hair,
in his complexion, and in the bulk of his head: and the mulattoes born of a
negreſs loſe more of the dark tinge than thoſe of a white woman. All
theſe facts ſeem to confirm our general idea, that the female molecules
occupy the centre of the <hi>foetus,</hi> and, though brought into the
cloſeſt union, are more abundant near the ſurface.</p>
               <p>In general, the beauty of the ſpecies can never be improved or
even preſerved, without croſſing the breed: and the elegance of form, the
ſtrength and vigour of the body, depend almoſt ſolely on the proportion
of the limbs. Accordingly, it is the males alone, which in man and in the
animals ennoble the race. Large, generous mares, covered by ſorry little
horſes, have always ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made colts; but a fine ſtallion will get a
beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful progeny from even the uglieſt mares, and the more diſſimilar
are the kinds of the parents, the handſomer will be the offspring. The ſame
may be ſaid of ſheep: the breed is always improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtrange rams,
while the ordinary ſmall ſort can never get good lambs from the moſt
excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ewes. I could enlarge upon this important <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1084600104:34"/>
ſubject, but I ſhould make too long a digreſſion. Yet, to detail all
the facts reſpecting the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of animals, would be the moſt real
ſervice that can be rendered to Natural Hiſtory. As many people employ or
amuſe themſelves in breeding Canaries, which requires little time, numerous
experiments might be made by croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and continuing to mix the fruits
of the embrace. I am confident that, by combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe obſervations with
thoſe upon the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds and upon man, we might be able to eſtimate the
preciſe influence of the male in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, compared with that of the
female; and conſequently, from the general relations, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce whether
ſuch a male would ſuit ſuch a female, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in the quadrupeds, as well as in man and in the ſmall
birds, the difference of the moral qualities often diſturbs the
correſpondence of the phyſical properties. If any thing could prove that
the character of the individual is an original impreſſion of nature which
education can never alter, it is an inſtance in the Canaries. 
<q rend="inline">"They almoſt always" ſays Hervieux, "differ
from each other in their tempers; ſome males are always ſad, and, as it
were, abſorbed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, generally bloated, and ſing but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in
a mournful tone . . . . require an immenſe time to learn, are imperfectly
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what they are taught, and eaſily forget it. . . . Theſe
Canaries are often ſo ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1084600104:35"/> that their feet and
tail are always dirty; they never gain the affection of their females, which
they ſoothe not with their ſong, while engaged in hatching; and the young
are little better than their fathers. . . . There are other Canaries which are
ſo wicked, that they kill the female; the only way to ſucceed is, to give
them two females, which will unite in their common defence; and after
ſubduing their mate by force, they will retain the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by love<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Sometimes the pravity of their
diſpoſition is in a certain meaſure compenſated by other qualities;
ſuch, for inſtance, as their melodious ſong, their beautiful plumage, and
their familiar turn. If you would wiſh to make them breed, you muſt give
them two ſtrong females one year older than themſelves; and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
ſhould be accuſtomed for ſeveral months previous to live in the ſame
cage, that they may have no jealouſy to each other. And a month before the
love-ſeaſon, they muſt be both ſet together in the breeding cage, and
at the proper time the male ſhould be let in among them. He will be very
quarrelſome the firſt three days, but the females, uniting againſt him,
will certainly in the end gain the aſcendant, and he will be obliged to
ſubmit, and at laſt become attached to them. Theſe kind of forced
marriages often ſucceed better than others from which more might be expected.
To preſerve the hatch, the firſt egg ſhould be removed, and an ivory one
put in its place; the ſame muſt be done the following days, always taking
them away as faſt as they are laid, leſt the male ſhould break them; and
after the laſt egg is dropped, the male muſt be ſhut in a ſeparate
cage, and the female permitted to hatch undiſturbed. After the young are
ready to be taken from the mother, the priſoner may be returned to his
female."

There are others ſo libidinous, that they drive the female from her neſt,
and would not allow her to ſit; theſe are of a hardy conſtitution, have a

will not ſuffer themſelves to be touched or careſſed, and can neither
be governed nor treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the reſt: they ſpurn at the leaſt
interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and it is only when left to the impulſe of their humours that
they will couple and breed. Others are exceſſively indolent; the gray for
inſtance ſcarcely ever take the pains to build a neſt, but it muſt be
provided for them, &amp;c. All theſe characters are, we ſee, very different
from each other, and from thoſe of our favourite Canaries, which are ever
joyous, and ever chanting; are <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1084600104:37"/> ſo tame and ſo lovely;
are excellent huſbands, and affectionate fathers; are of ſo mild a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and of ſo happy a diſpoſition, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every generous
impreſſion, and glow with each exalted feeling. They continually amuſe
the female by their ſong, they ſooth the languor of her occupation, they
entreat her to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in hatching, and, in her place, they ſit
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hours every day; they alſo feed the young; and laſtly, receive
whatever inſtructions are given. From theſe alone we are to judge of the
ſpecies, and I mention the others only, to ſhew that, even in animals, the
temper is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from nature, and not formed by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the apparently wicked diſpoſition, which drives
them to break their eggs and kill their young, proceeds often from the fire of
their amorous paſſions. To enjoy the female oftener, and riot in the
fulneſs of pleaſure, they plunder the neſt, and deſtroy the deareſt
objects of their affection. The beſt way to breed from theſe birds, is to
ſeparate them, and put them in the cage; it will be much better to give them
a chamber having a ſunny aſpect, and facing the eaſt in winter. For in
the cage they will break the eggs to repeat their embrace; but when they are
lodged in an apartment where there are more females than males, they will pay
their addreſſes to another, and allow the firſt to hatch undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed.
Beſides, the males, from jealouſy, will <pb n="25" facs="tcp:1084600104:38"/> not ſuffer
diſorders to be committed; and when one is prompted by ardor to teaſe his
female and break her eggs, they give him a ſound beating, ſufficient to
mortify his concupiſcence.</p>
               <p>The materials given to build their neſt, are the ſcrapings
of fine linen rags, cows and ſtags hair, uſeleſs for other purpoſes,
moſs, and ſlender dry ſtalks of hay. The Goldfinches and Siſkins, when
lodged with the hen Canaries, to obtain a croſs-breed, make uſe of the
moſs and hay, but the Canaries prefer the hair and lint; but theſe muſt
be well divided, leſt the fibres, ſticking to their feet, ſhould
occaſion the eggs to be broken.</p>
               <p>To feed them, a crib is placed in the chamber, which is pierced
all round with holes that admit the head; and into it a portion of this mixture
is put; three pints of rape-ſeed, two of oats, two of millet, and laſtly, a
pint of hemp ſeed, and the crib is repleniſhed every twelve or thirteen
days, taking care that the grains be well cleaned and winnowed. This food is
proper when they are only ſitting; but the day before the young are excluded
from the ſhell, the parents ought to have a dry cake baked without ſalt,
and after eating it, they ſhould have hard boiled eggs; one being
ſufficient for two males and four fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, and two for four males and eight
females, and ſo on in proportion. They ought to have no ſallad or greens
while rearing the offspring, for this would weaken much the young. But to vary
ſomewhat their diet, they ſhould every <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1084600104:39"/> three days be
preſented on a plate with a bit of white bread ſoaked in water, and
ſqueezed in the hand; this being not ſo rich as the cake, and preventing
them from growing too fat while breeding. It would alſo be proper to give
them a few Canary ſeeds<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Alpis</hi> in French, the
Canary-graſs being termed <hi>Alpiſte.</hi> It is the <hi>Phalaris
Canarienſis</hi> of Linuaeus. It is a native of the Canary iſlands, whence
it ſprings ſpontaneouſly in the corn fields; but is now cultivated in
ſmall qu ntities in many parts of Europe.</note>, but only once in two days,
leſt they be heated too much. Sugar biſcuit commonly produces that effect,
and is attended with another ſtill worſe, that the hens fed on it lay eggs
that are addle, or too ſmall and tender. When the eggs are ſmall, the
rape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed ſhould be boiled every day to blunt its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. 
<q rend="inline">"Long experience," ſays Father Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, "has
informed us, that this ſort of food agrees beſt, whatever the authors, who
have written on Canaries, may aſſert."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the hatch, the Canaries ought to be purged with plantain
and lettuce-ſeeds; but care muſt be taken to remove the young birds, which
would be greatly weakened by this regimen, and the parents muſt not be
confined to it longer than two days. When you want to feed them with the
ſtick, you ought not, as moſt bird-catchers adviſe, leave them with the
mother till the eleventh or twelfth day; you ought to remove them with their
neſt as early as the eighth day. The food for the young <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1084600104:40"/>
Canaries ought to be prepared before hand; it is a paſte compoſed of boiled
rape-ſeed, yolks of eggs and crumbs of cake mixed together, and beaten up
with a little water. It ought to be given to them every two hours, and rammed
into their bill. It muſt not be too liquid, leſt it turn ſour, and it
muſt be made freſh every day till the young can eat without
aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The produce of theſe captive birds is not ſo regular, but
appears to be more numerous than it probably would be in the ſtate of
liberty. Some females have four or five hatches annually, and lay four, five,
ſix, or even ſeven eggs each time; and generally they have three hatches,
and the moulting hinders them from another<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <q rend="inline">"There are females which never lay at all, and
are called <hi>brehaignes</hi> (barren); others lay only once or twice in the
whole year, and even repoſe two or three days between the firſt and
ſecond egg. Others have only three hatches, which are regular,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of three eggs laid without interruption. A fourth ſort,
called the <hi>common,</hi> becauſe the moſt numerous, may have four
hatches of four or five eggs, but not always uniform. Others are ſtill better
layers, having five hatches, and ſtill more if allowed; and in each of
theſe are ſix or ſeven eggs. When this kind feed well, they are
excellent, and we cannot be too careful of them, for they are worth half a
dozen of the ordinary Canaries."

                     </q>
                  </note>. Some however ſit even during moulting, if
they happen to be laying before that ſeaſon. The birds of the ſame hatch
do not all moult at the ſame time. The weakeſt firſt drop their feathers,
and the ſtrongeſt more than a month afterwards. In Jonquil Canaries this
change <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1084600104:41"/> of plumage is tedious, and commonly more dangerous
than in the other kinds. The female Jonquils have only three hatches, each of
three eggs; the flaxen coloured Canaries are too deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and their brood
ſeldom thrives. The Pink ſhew a reluctance to pair with each other; in a
large volery, the male but rarely couples with the female of his own colour,
and to form the union, they muſt be confined together in a cage. The white
ſort are commonly valuable in every reſpect; they lay and breed as well, or
rather better than the others, and the variegated white are the hardieſt of
all.</p>
               <p>Whatever differences there may be in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and
prolific powers of theſe birds, the period of incubation is the ſame; all
of them ſit thirteen days; and when the excluſion of the young is a day
earlier or later, it is owing to ſome particular circumſtance. Cold retards
the proceſs, and heat forwards it; accordingly the firſt hatch, which is in
April, requires thirteen days and a half, or even fourteen days, if the weather
is chilly; but the third, which happens during the heats of July and Auguſt,
is effected in twelve days and a half, or even twelve days. It would be proper
to ſeparate all the good eggs from the bad; and, to do this with certainty,
we ought to wait to the eighth or ninth day, and take each gently by the two
ends for fear of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and examine it in a ſtrong light, or by a
candle, and reject all that are addle, which if left <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1084600104:42"/> would
only fatigue the hen. By this trial we may often reduce three hatches to two;
and in that caſe the third female may be liberated, and permitted to begin a
ſecond neſt<note n="*" place="bottom"> When the eggs of one female are ſet
under another, they muſt be all ſound. If addle or tainted eggs be given
the variegated fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, they will throw them out of the neſt; and if the
neſt is too deep to admit their being tumbled out, they peck them till
broken, which often ſpoils the neſt, and fruſtrates the whole hatch.
Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of other colours cover wind eggs when placed under them.

                  </note>. A plan ſtrongly recommended by bird-fanciers is to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the eggs as they are dropt, and to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in their ſtead
eggs of ivory; ſo that after the laying is over, the real eggs are
reſtored, and all hatch at the ſame time. Commonly the egg is dropt at
ſix or ſeven o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is ſaid that if it be a
ſingle hour later the bird is ſick; and, as the laying proceeds thus
regularly, it is eaſy to remove the eggs as faſt as they are excluded<note n="†" place="bottom">The laying is always at the ſame hour, if the
female is healthy; however, the laſt egg muſt be excepted, which is
commonly ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours later, and often a day. This laſt egg is always
ſmaller than the reſt; and I am told that it always gives a cock-bird. It
would be curious to aſcertain this ſingular fact.</note>. But this
precaution is more ſuited to the convenience of man than conſonant to the
train of Nature. When five of ſix young are hatched at once, they exhauſt
the vigour of the mother, and rather damp her ſpirits; but if they appear
ſucceſſively, they repeatedly renew her pleaſure, and inſpire new
courage to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her duty. Intelligent perſons who have 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1084600104:43"/> had experience in breeding theſe birds aſſure me,
that they always ſucceed beſt when they do not employ this artificial
expedient.</p>
               <p>We may aſſert that, in general, all the nice precautions,
and the refined manoeuvres recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by writers for training the Canaries,
are pernicious rather than uſeful; and that in every reſpect we ought as
much as poſſible to copy Nature. In their native country they haunt the
ſides of ſmall rivulets, or wet gullies<note n="*" place="bottom">The Canary
Finches imported into England are bred in the <hi>barancos,</hi> or gullies
formed by the torrents from the mountains.

                  </note>; we
ought therefore to give them plenty of water, both for drinking and bathing. As
they belong to an exceedingly mild climate, they muſt be ſheltered from the
rigours of winter. It appears indeed that being long naturalized in France,
they can bear the cold of that country; for they may be kept in a chamber
without a fire, and even without a glaſs-window, a wire-grate to prevent
their eſcape being ſufficient; ſeveral dealers in birds have informed me
that they loſt fewer in this way than when the rooms were heated by a fire.
The ſame may be ſaid of their food, which is probably the more ſuited to
them the ſimpler it is<note n="†" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>I have often obſerved from my own experience, and from
that of others who adhered ſcrupulouſly to all the minute directions given
by authors, that extreme care and attention often killed their birds. A regular
diet of rape-ſeed and millet, water every day in winter, and once or twice
a-day in ſummer; groundſel, when it is to be had, in the month of May;
chickweed in the time of moulting, and inſtead of ſugar, bruiſed oats and
Turkey wheat, and above all great cleanlineſs, areall that I would recommend.

                     <p>N. B. I muſt here correct a ſmall error. All the
bird-catchers whom I have conſulted tell me, that we ought to avoid giving
them chickweed in the time of moulting, for it is too cooling, and would
protract their ſtate of indiſpoſition. The other directions of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau
ſeem to me well founded.</p>
                  </note>. A circumſtance that requires 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1084600104:44"/> the moſt attention is not to haſten their firſt
hatch; it is common to allow them to couple about the twentieth or twenty-fifth
of March, but it would be better to wait till the twelfth or fifteenth of
April; for if the ſeaſon be cold, they are apt to contract a diſguſt to
each other; and if the females happen to have eggs, they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, at
leaſt till the weather grows warm: and thus a whole hatch is loſt in
attempting to accelerate the breeding.</p>
               <p>The young Canaries differ from the old ones, both in the colour
of their plumage, and in ſome other circumſtances.

lively; their toes are rougher, and incline more on black, if they are of the
gray kind; their nails are alſo thicker, and longer than thoſe of the young

                  </note>. The female is often ſo like the male that they cannot at
firſt be diſtinguiſhed; however, the colours are always deeper in the
male, the head rather thicker and longer, and the temples of a yellow, more
inclined to orange; and under the bill there is a ſort of yellow flame which
deſcends lower than in the female; its legs are alſo ſtronger; and
laſtly, it begins to warble almoſt as ſoon as it is able to feed by
itſelf. It is true that ſome females chant at that tender age with almoſt
as much ſpirit as the males: but, joining all theſe marks together, we may
be able even before the firſt month to decide which are males or females;
after that time there is no more uncertainty in that reſpect, for the ſong
of the males then begins to betray their ſex.</p>
               <p>Every ſudden utterance of ſound is in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals an obvious
ſign of paſſion; and as love is of all the inward feelings that which the
ofteneſt, <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1084600104:46"/> and the moſt forcibly agitates the frame,
the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor is conſtantly marked by the expreſſion of the voice. The birds
by their ſong, the bull by his lowing, the horſe by his neighing, the bear
by his loud murmur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all announce the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame
deſire. The appetite is much calmer in the female than in the male, and
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is but ſeldom expreſſed by the voice. The chant of the
hen Canary is only a feeble tone of tender ſatisfaction, a coy aſſent to
the warm applications of her mate, and inſpired by the eloquence of his
warble; but when this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is once excited in her veins, it becomes
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to her exiſtence; and if ſhe be parted from her lover, ſhe
ſickens and dies.</p>
               <p>It ſeldom happens that the Canaries bred in a chamber are
indiſpoſed before laying; ſome males only exhauſt their vigour, and
fall victims to the ardor of paſſion. If the female becomes ſick while
hatching, her eggs muſt be taken from her, and given to another; for though
ſhe recovers ſoon, ſhe would not ſit on them again. The firſt
ſymptom of bad health, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the males, is ſadneſs; as ſoon
as they loſe their natural cheerfulneſs, they ought to be put alone in a
cage, and ſet in the ſun in the chamber where the female is lodged. If he
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes bloated, we muſt notice if there be a pimple below his tail; when
this pimple is ripe and white, the bird itſelf often pierces it with the
bill; but if the ſuppuration advances too <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1084600104:47"/> ſlowly, we
may diſcharge it with a large needle, and then fill the wound with ſpittle
without ſalt, which would be too ſmarting. Next day the patient ſhould be
let looſe in the chamber, and it will be eaſy to perceive by his treatment
of the female, and the fondneſs that he ſhews, whether he is cured or not.
In this laſt caſe, we muſt take him again, and blow through a ſmall
quill ſome white wine under his wings, place him in the ſun, and notice
next day the ſtate of his health. If he ſtill continue deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
indifferent to his female, his recovery is now almoſt deſperate; we muſt
remove him into a ſeparate cage, and give the hen another male like the one
ſhe has loſt; or if ſuch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, we muſt ſeek one of the
ſame ſpecies at leaſt. A greater fondneſs commonly ſubſiſts
between thoſe that reſemble each other, except in the caſe of the Pink
Canaries, which prefer the females of a different colour; but this new male
muſt not be a novice in love, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt have already
raiſed a hatch. If the female falls ſick, the ſame treatment may be
uſed.</p>
               <p>The moſt common cauſe of diſtempers is the too great
plenty, or richneſs of food. When theſe birds make their neſts in a cage,
they often eat to exceſs, or ſelect the nutritious aliments intended for
their young; and moſt of them ſicken from repletion, or inflammation. If
they be kept in a chamber, this danger is in a great <pb n="35" facs="tcp:1084600104:48"/>
meaſure removed, their numbers preventing their gluttony. A male which ſits
too long, is ſure of being beat by the other males; and the ſame is the
caſe with the females. Theſe quarrels give them exerciſe, and
neceſſarily produce tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and for this reaſon chiefly it is that
they ſeldom are ever ſick in a chamber during the time of breeding: their
infirmities and diſeaſes appear only after they have hatched; moſt of
them have firſt the pimple which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and then they all undergo
the moulting. Some ſupport well this metamorphoſis, and ſtill ſing a
part of the day; but moſt of them loſe their voice, and a few languiſh
and die. After the females are ſix or ſeven years old, many of them die in
changing their plumage; the males recover better from the attendant
ſickneſs, and ſurvive their mates three or four years. Indeed we muſt
conſider moulting as the regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Nature, rather than as an
accidental diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper; and if theſe birds were not reduced by us to
captivity, and rendered delicate by our treatment, they would ſuffer only a
ſlight indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and would ſpontaneouſly diſcover the proper
remedies: but at preſent it is a grievous ſickneſs, often fatal, and

                  </note>. The young Canaries <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1084600104:49"/>
drop their feathers the firſt year ſix weeks after they are hatched; they
become low-ſpirited, appear bloated, and conceal the head in their plumage;
at this time the down only falls; but the following year they loſe the
quills, even thoſe of the wings, and of the tail. The young birds of the
later hatches which happen in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember or after, ſuffer much more from the
moulting, than thoſe which are excluded in the ſpring; in that delicate
condition the cold is extremely pernicious, and they would all periſh if not
kept where it is temperate, or even pretty warm. As long as the moulting
laſts, that is ſix weeks or two months, Nature labours at the production of
new feathers; and the organic molecules, which were before directed to the
ſupply of the ſeminal liquor, are now abſorbed in this growth; and hence
the exuberance of life being diverted into different channels, their ardor
ceaſes, and the buſineſs of propagation is for the time
ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>The moſt fatal and the moſt common diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
eſpecially in young Canaries, is what is called the <hi>ſwallow
(avalure),</hi> in which the bowels ſeem to be <hi>ſwallowed,</hi> and
drawn to the extremity of their body; the inteſtines are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1084600104:50"/> through the ſkin of the belly in the ſtate of
inflammation, redneſs, and diſtenſion; the feathers on that part drop,
the bird pines, gives over eating, though always ſitting beſide the food,
and dies in a few days. The ſource of the diſeaſe is the exceſſive
abundance or richneſs of the aliments. All remedies are vain; and the change
of regimen is the only thing which can recover a few out of a great number. The
bird is put into a ſeparate cage, and given water and lettuce ſeeds; thus
the heat that conſumes it is tempered, and evacuations are ſometimes
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed which ſave its life. This diſtemper alſo is the fruit of their
artificial education, for it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom attacks thoſe which are trained by
their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; we ought therefore to take the greateſt care not to overfeed
them with the ſtick; boiled rape-ſeed, and ſome chickweed, are proper,
but no ſugar or biſcuit; and in general we ſhould give them too little
rather than too much.</p>
               <p>When the Canary utters a frequent feeble cry, which ſeems to
come from the bottom of its breaſt, it is ſaid to be aſthmatic; it is
alſo ſubject to a certain obſtruction of voice, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after
moulting. This ſort of aſthma is cured by giving it the ſeeds of
plantain, and hard biſcuit ſoaked in white wine; and to reſtore its voice
it ought to have generous food, ſuch as yolks of eggs beat up with crumbs of
bread; and for drink, liquorice-water, that is water in which that root has
been ſteeped and boiled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1084600104:51"/> The Canaries are alſo ſubject to a
ſort of ſhanker on the bill. This diſorder is owing to the ſame cauſe
with the <hi>ſwallow,</hi> the abundance or richneſs of food producing an
inflammation, which, inſtead of affecting the inteſtines, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
extends to the throat or palate; the ſame cooling remedies muſt be applied;
they ſhould be given lettuce-ſeeds, and bruiſed melon-ſeeds mixed with
their drink.</p>
               <p>The mites and the ſcab with which theſe ſmall birds are
ſometimes affected are generally owing to the dirtineſs with which they are
kept. Care muſt be taken to preſerve them clean, to give them water to
bathe in, to avoid putting old or bad wood in their cages, and to cover them
only with new cloth that is not moth-eaten; and the ſeeds and herbs with
which they are to be fed ſhould be fanned and waſhed. We muſt pay this
attention, if we would wiſh them to be neat and healthy. In the ſtate of
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they would themſelves preſerve cleanlineſs; but impriſoned,
they are ſubject to the loathſome diſorders incident to that ſtate:
however, many of theſe birds, though reduced to the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly condition of
captivity, are never ſick, and in theſe habit ſeems to have become a
ſecond nature. In general, the ſource of their diſeaſes is the heat of
their conſtitution. They always need water; and if a plate with ſnow be
placed in the cage, or even in the volery, they will roll in it ſeveral times
with expreſſions of pleaſure, <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1084600104:52"/> though in the
coldeſt weather. This proves that it is rather pernicious than uſeful to
keep them in very hot places<note n="*" place="bottom"> Theſe birds require not
to be kept in a warm place, as many pretend; in the moſt intenſe colds they
welter in ſnow, when preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them on a plate. For my own part, I have
them in a chamber in winter with only an iron-grating, and the windows open;
they ſing admirably, and I never loſe any.

               <p>But there is another diſtemper to which the Canaries and many
other birds are ſubject<note n="†" place="bottom">The Jays, the
Goldfinches, all the Parrots, and the largeſt Aras.</note>, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in
the ſtate of confinement: this is the epilepſy. The yellow Canaries in
particular are oftener than the others ſeized with the falling ſickneſs,
which attacks them ſuddenly, and even ſurpriſes them in the midſt of
their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned warble. It is ſaid that they muſt not be
touched the moment they fall, but muſt be watched till they diſcharge a
drop of blood from the bill, and that they may be then lifted up, and will
recover themſelves, and in a ſhort time reſume their ſenſes and their
life: that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to wait till Nature makes that ſalutary
effort which is announced by the expreſſion of the drop of blood, and that
if handled prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely, the violence of agitation would bring on inſtant
death. It is to be wiſhed that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation were aſcertained, ſome
circumſtances in which appear to me rather doubtful. Certain it is, that if
they eſcape the firſt attack of this <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1084600104:53"/> epilepſy, they
live a long time after, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attain the ſame age with thoſe
which have never been affected by that diſtemper. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am inclined to
think, that a ſmall inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the toes would be beneficial, for in that
way Parrots are cured of the epilepſy.</p>
               <p>What miſeries in the train of ſlavery! Would theſe birds,
if they enjoyed their native free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, be aſthmatic, ſcabby, and
epileptical? Would they be afflicted by inflammations, abſceſſes, and
ſhankers? and the moſt melancholy of diſorders, what is produced by the
craving of unſatisfied luſt, is it not common to all beings reduced to
captivity? In particular, the females, whoſe ſeelings are ſo nice and
ſo tender, are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it than the males. It has been obſerved,
that after the hen Canary falls ſick in the ſpring before pairing, ſhe
ſhrinks, languiſhes, and dies. The amorous paſſion is awakened by the
ſinging of the males around her, while ſhe has at the ſame time no
opportunity of gratification. The males, though they firſt feel libidinous
deſires, and always appear more ardent, ſupport better the languor of
celibacy; they ſeldom die of continence, but they are often killed by
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive venery.</p>
               <p>The hen Canaries can, like the females of other birds, lay eggs
without commerce with the male. The egg in itſelf is, as we have elſewhere
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, only a matrix which the bird excludes, and will remain unprolific,
if not impregnated <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1084600104:54"/> with the ſeed of the male; and the
heat of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation, inſtead of quickening it, only haſtens its
putrefaction. It has alſo been remarked that if the females be entirely
ſeparated from the males, ſo as not to ſee and hear them, they very
ſeldom lay; and that they ofteneſt drop their eggs, when melted by the view
or the ſong of the males: ſo much do even diſtant objects act upon
feeling animals, and ſo many are the ways in which the ſubtile flame of
love is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated<note n="*" place="bottom">We ſhall here mention two facts
to which we were witneſs. A female ſung ſo well, that ſhe was taken for
a male, and paired with another female; the overſight being afterwards
diſcovered, a male was given to her, who taught her the proper functions of
her ſex; ſhe took to laying and renounced her ſong. The other fact is
that of a female, alive at preſent, that chants or rather whiſtles a tune,
though ſhe has laid two eggs in her cage, which are found to be addle, as all
thoſe are which hens lay without the commerce of a cock.</note>!</p>

               <head>FOREIGN BIRDS, THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CANARIES.</head>
               <p>THE foreign birds which may be referred to the Canary, are few
in number; we are acquainted with only three ſpecies. The firſt is that
which was ſent to us from the eaſtern coaſt of Africa, under the name of
<hi>the Mozambique Canary,</hi> which ſeems to be a ſhade between the
Canaries and the Siſkins. It is delineated <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 364, Fig. 1.
and 2. Yellow is the prevailing colour of the lower part of the body, and brown
that of the upper, except the rump and the coverts of the tail, which are
yellow: theſe coverts, as well as thoſe of the wings and their quills, are
edged with white or whitiſh. The ſame yellow and brown occur on the head,
diſtributed in alternate bars; that which ſtretches over the top of the
head is brown, next two yellow ones over the eyes, then two brown ones which
riſe behind the eyes, after theſe two yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ones, and laſt of all two
brown ones, which extend from the corners of the bill. This bird is rather
ſmaller than thoſe from the Canary Iſlands; its length from the tip of
the bill to the end of the tail is about four inches and a half, that of the
tail is only about an inch. The <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1084600104:57"/> female differs very little
from the male, either in ſize or in colour. This bird is perhaps the ſame
with that of Madagaſcar, mentioned by Flaccourt under the name of
<hi>Mangoiche,</hi> which he ſays is a ſpecies of Canary.</p>
               <p>It is likely that this bird, which in its plumage reſembles
much our variegated Canaries, was their progenitor; and that the entire
ſpecies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the ancient continent, and to the Canary Iſlands,
which may be conſidered as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent to the mainland: for the one mentioned
by Briſſon under the name of <hi>the Jamaica Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> and of which
Sloane and Ray have given a ſhort deſcription<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Bird like the <hi>Serin,</hi> variegated
with cinereous, dilute, yellow, and duſky colours."</q> Its extreme length is
eight inches, its alar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is twelve inches, the bill ſhort and ſtrong,
three-fourths of an inch long (or one-third according to Ray), the tail one
inch, the leg and foot one inch and one-fourth. (Briſſon ſuſpects that
Sloane is miſtaken in his meaſures, for the proportions are not
conſiſtent.) The upper mandible brown bordering on blue, the lower lighter
coloured; the head and the throat gray; the upper part of the body of a
yellow-brown, the wings and the tail of a deep brown, radiated with white, the
breaſt and belly yellow, the under part of the tail white, the feet bluiſh,
the nails brown, hooked, and very ſhort.

                  </note>, appears to me to be widely different from our
Canaries, which are not found at all in America. Hiſtorians and travellers
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that none were originally in Peru, and that the firſt Canary was
introduced there in 1556, and that the ſpreading of theſe birds in 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1084600104:58"/> America, and eſpecially in the Antilles, was long
poſterior to that date. Father du Tertre relates that du Parquet, in 1657,
bought of a merchant who touched at theſe iſlands, a great number of real
Canaries, which he ſet at liberty; ſince which time they were heard
warbling about his houſe; ſo that it is probable that they have multiplied
in that country. If true Canaries be found in Jamaica, they may have been
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from thoſe tranſported to the Antilles, and naturalized there
in the year 1657. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the bird deſcribed by Sloane, Ray, and
Briſſon, by the appellation of <hi>Jamaica Canary,</hi> appears to differ
too much from the natives of the Fortunate iſlands, to be ſuppoſed to
have origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from thoſe tranſplanted into the Antilles.</p>
               <p>While this article was at the preſs, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral
Canaries from the Cape of Good Hope, among which I have perceived three males,
one female, and a young one of the ſame year. Theſe males are very like the
Green Canary of Provence; they differ in being ſomewhat larger, and their
bills being proportionally thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: their wings are alſo better variegated,
the quills of the tail edged with a diſtinct yellow, and they have no yellow
on the rump.</p>
               <p>In the young Canary, the colours were ſtill fainter and leſs
marked than in the female.</p>
               <p>But whatever ſmall differences exiſt, I am ſtill the more
confirmed that the variegated <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1084600104:59"/> Canaries of the Cape of
Mozambique<note n="*" place="bottom">It appears that the Mozambique Canary is not
confined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to that region. I have found among the drawings of
Commerſon a coloured figure of this bird very diſtinctly marked.
Commerſon calls it the Cape Canary, and informs us that it had been carried
to the Iſle of France, where it was naturalized, and even greatly multiplied,
and was known there by the name of <hi>the Bird of the Cape.</hi> We may expect
to find in the ſame manner at Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambique, and in ſome other countries of
Africa, the variegated Canaries of the Cape, perhaps even thoſe from the
Fortunate Iſlands, and probably many other varieties of this
ſpecies.</note>, of Provence, and of Italy, are all derived from the ſame
common ſource, and that they belong to one ſpecies, which is ſpread, and
ſettled in all the climates of the ancient continent ſuited to its
conſtitution, from Provence and Italy to the Cape of Good Hope, and the
adjacent iſlands. Only this bird has aſſumed more of the green tint in
Provence, more of the gray in Italy, more of the brown or variegated colour at
the Cape of Good Hope, and ſeems by the variety of its plumage to point at
the influence of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent climate.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond ſpecies which appears to us to be the neareſt

varieties of the Canary, the yellow and the black, but it has the ſame bulk
nearly; and except its being rather rounder, the ſame ſhape. Its bill is
alſo ſimilar, and it prefers an oily ſeed as the Canary does millet and
panic. But the Warabée has an excluſive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for a plant that

below the eyes, the throat, the fore-part of the neck, the breaſt, and the
top of the belly to the legs, are black; the upper-part of the head and all the
body and the lower belly, are yellow, except a kind of black collar, which
encircles the neck behind, and is ſet off by the yellow. The coverts and the
quills of the wings are black, edged with a lighter colour; the feathers of the
tail are alſo black, but with a greeniſh yellow border; the bill likewiſe
is black, and the legs of a light brown. This bird keeps in <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1084600104:61"/> flocks, but we know nothing more in regard to its mode of life.</p>

               <p>NATURE herſelf ſeems to have aſſigned theſe birds a
place next after the Canaries; for their mutual commerce ſucceeds better than
the intercourſe of either with any other contiguous ſpecies; and what
points out the cloſeneſs of this relation, the progeny is prolific<note n="*" place="bottom">This obſervation was communicated by Daubenton the
younger. Friſch aſſures us, that pairing a Vine Linnet (Redpole) with a
white hen Canary, that was in the habit of coming abroad every day and
returning to its rooſt, it made its neſt and laid its eggs in a
neighbouring buſh, and when the young were hatched, it brought them to the
window of the houſe. He adds, that this croſs-breed had the whole plumage
of the mother, and the red ſpots of the father, eſpecially on the
head.</note>, eſpecially when a male Linnet is joined with a female
Canary.</p>
               <p>Few birds are ſo common as the Linnet, but ſtill fewer
perhaps unite ſo many amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: a pleaſant warble, a rich
plumage, docility of diſpoſition, ſuſceptibility of attachment;
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing whatever, in ſhort, could invite the attention of man,
and contribute to his delight. Endowed with ſuch talents, it could not long
preſerve its freedom; and ſtill leſs, when nurſed in the boſom of
ſlavery, could it retain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1084600104:66"/> the beauties of
its original purity. In fact, the charming red colour with which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has
painted its head and breaſt, and which in the ſtate of liberty ſparkles
with durable luſtre, wears off by degrees, and ſoon diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears entirely
in our cages and voleries. There remain only a few obſcure veſtiges after
the firſt moulting<note n="*" place="bottom">The red of the head changes into a
ruſty-brown varied with blackiſh, and that of the breaſt paſſes into
nearly the ſame colour; but the new ſhades are not ſo deep. An
<hi>amateur</hi> told me, that he has raiſed ſome of theſe Linnets which
preſerved the red: this fact ſtands ſingle.</note>.</p>
               <p>With regard to the change effected in its ſong, we
ſubſtitute for the free and varied modulations which ſpring and love
inſpire, the ſtrained notes of a harſh muſic, which they repeat but
imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and which has neither the beauties of art nor the charms of
nature. Some have alſo ſucceeded in teaching it to ſpeak different
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that is to whiſtle ſome Italian, French, and Engliſh words,
&amp;c. and ſometimes even to pronounce theſe with conſiderable fluency.
Many perſons have from curioſity gone from London to Kenſington merely to
hear an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary's Linnet, which articulated the words <hi>pretty boy.</hi>
The fact is, it had been taken out of the neſt when only two or three days
old, before it had time to acquire the parent ſong; and juſt beginning to
liſten with attention, it was ſtruck with the ſound of <hi>pretty
boy,</hi> and learned it from <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1084600104:67"/> imitation<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>A goldfinch which was taken from the neſt two or three
days after hatching, and ſet in a window that looked into a garden where the
wrens reſorted, caught their ſong, and had not a ſingle note of its own
ſpecies.</p> 
                     <p>A ſparrow was taken from the neſt when it was fledged,
and educated under a Linnet; but hearing by accident a goldfinch, its ſong
was a mixture of that of the Linnet and the goldfinch.</p> 
                     <p>A robin was ſet under a very fine nightingale, which began
to be out of ſong, and in a fortnight was perfectly mute; the robin had
three-parts in four of the nightingale's warble, the reſt being a confuſed
jumble.</p> 
                     <p>Laſtly, Mr. Barrington adds, that the Canaries imported
from Tyrol ſeem to have been educated by parents the progenitor of which was
inſtructed by a nightingale; while the Canaries bred in England appear to
have derived their ſong from the tit-lark.

                     <p>If we breed a young Linnet with a chaffinch, or nightingale,

                  </note>. This fact,
together with many others, appears to me to eſtabliſh the opinion of the
Honourable Daines Barrington, that birds have no innate ſong; and that the
warble peculiar to the different ſpecies, and its varieties, have nearly the
ſame origin with the languages and the dialects of various nations<note n="†" place="bottom">The loſs of the parent-cock at the critical time
for inſtruction occaſions undoubtedly the varieties in the ſong of each
ſpecies; becauſe then the neſtling has either attended to the ſong of
ſome other birds, or perhaps invented ſome notes of its own, which are
perpetuated from generation to generation, till ſimilar accidents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
other alterations. The truth is, that ſcarcely any two birds of the ſame
ſpecies have exactly the ſame notes, if they are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately attended to,
though there is a general reſemblance. 
<bibl>BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINGTON, <hi>Philoſ. Tranſ.</hi>
1773.</bibl>
                  </note>. Mr. Barrington tells us, that in experiments of this kind
he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a young cock Linnet of three weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1084600104:68"/> to fly, not only on account of its great facility and talent for
imitation, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that ſpecies it is eaſier to diſtinguiſh
the ſex; ſome of the outer-quills of the wings in the male having the
outer-edge white as far as the ſhaft, while in the female theſe are only
bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with that colour.</p>
               <p>It follows from the experiments of this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gentleman, that
the young Linnets educated by the different kinds of larks, and even by an
African Linnet, called <hi>Vengolina,</hi> of which we ſhall afterwards
treat, acquired not the ſong of their parent, but that of their inſtructor.
Only a few retained the <hi>call</hi> of its ſpecies, or the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
<hi>chuckle,</hi> which they had heard of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents before they were
parted.</p>
               <p>It is extremely doubtful whether our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Linnet, called by
ſome the <hi>Gray Linnet,</hi> is different from that termed the <hi>Vine
Linnet,</hi> or the <hi>Red Linnet:</hi> for, 1. The red ſpots which
diſtinguiſh the males in the Red Linnet are far from being conſtant,
ſince, as we have already obſerved, they become obliterated in
confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>Of four cock Linnets, which were conſequently red, brought
to me on the twelfth of July, I expoſed one to the open air, and ſet three
in a chamber, two of which were ſhut up in the ſame cage. The red on the
head of the latter began to diſappear by the twenty-eighth of Auguſt, and
alſo that on the lower part of the breaſt. On the eighth of September one
of the two was found dead; its head was entirely diveſted of feathers, and
even ſlightly wounded. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the one had fought the other
after the moulting, as if their acquaintance was diſſolved by the
diſguiſe of plumage. The red of the head of the vanquiſhed Linnet no
longer exiſted, for all the feathers had dropped, and that of the breaſt
was more than half effaced.</p> 
                     <p>The third which was ſhut up was very late in moulting, and
retained its red till that time. The one that was kept in the open air made its
eſcape at the end of three months; but it had already loſt all its
red.—It follows from this experiment, that either the open air haſtens
the diſappearance of the red, by advancing the moulting; or that the want of
freſh air has a ſmaller ſhare in the change of plumage in theſe birds
than the loſs of liberty.</p>
                  </note>. 2. They are not a diſcriminating
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1084600104:69"/> as traces of them are to be found in the bird
deſcribed to be the male of the Gray Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, where the feathers on the
breaſt are of a dull red in their middle. 3. The moulting tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, and
for a time almoſt diſcharges this red, which recovers not its luſtre till
the fine wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but from the end of September colours the middle of the
feathers on the breaſt, as in that reckoned by Briſſon a common cock
Linnet. 4. Geſner at Turin, Olina at Rome, Linnaeus at Stockholm<note n="*" place="bottom">No mention is made of the Gray Linnet in the <hi>Fauna
Suecica.</hi> Klein ſpeaks of one Zarn, author of a letter on the birds of
Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, where he endeavours to prove that there is only one ſpecies of
Linnet. I have heard the ſame aſſertion of many bird-catchers, who had
never ſeen the letter; and Hebert, who is certainly a fit judge of the
matter, is of the ſame opinion.</note>, and Belon in France, have known in
their reſpective countries only the Red Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. 5. Bird-catchers, who have
in France followed that profeſſion more than thirty years, have never found
a ſingle cock Linnet which had not the red ſhade correſponding to the
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and at the ſame time we ſee many Gray Linnets in the cage. 6.
Even thoſe who admit <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1084600104:70"/> the exiſtence of Gray Linnets in
the ſtate of nature agree, that they are ſcarcely ever caught, particularly
in ſummer, which they attribute to their ſhy diſpoſition. 7. Add to all
theſe, that the Red and Gray Linnets are very ſimilar in the reſt of
their plumage, in their ſize, in the proportions and ſhape of their parts,
in their ſong, and in their habits. And it will be eaſy to infer, that if
Gray Linnets really do exiſt, they are either, 1. all females; or, 2. all
young males of the year's hatch before October, for at that time they begin to
be marked; 3. ſuch as being bred apart from the mothers cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
red in the ſtate of captivity; 4. thoſe which being caught loſe their
tint in the cage<note n="*" place="bottom">We muſt obſerve that thoſe birds
which have had the red ſpots, but loſt them, ſtill retain on the ſame
parts a rufous colour, approaching to red; which never appears in the young
that have been bred without the mothers, and that conſequently have never
been marked with red.</note>; or, laſtly, thoſe in which this beautiful
colour is effaced by moulting, diſeaſe, or ſome other cauſe.</p>
               <p>The reader will not then be ſurpriſed that I refer theſe
two Linnets to the ſame identical ſpecies; and conſider the gray ſort
as only an accidental variety, partly effected by education, and afterwards
miſtaken by authors.</p>
               <p>The Linnet often builds its neſt in vineyards, and hence it
has been called the <hi>Vine-Linnet.</hi> Sometimes it places its neſt on the
ground; at other times it fixes it between two props, or <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1084600104:71"/>
even in the vine itſelf; it breeds alſo in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper, gooſeberry, and
hazel-nut trees, in young copſes, &amp;c. A great number of theſe neſts
have been brought to me in the month of May, a few in July, and only one in
September: they were all compoſed of ſlender roots, ſmall leaves, and
moſs on the outſide, and lined with feathers, hairs, and a great deal of
wool. I never found more than ſix eggs; that of the fourth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember had
only three; they were of a dirty white, ſpotted with brown red at the large
end. The Linnets have ſeldom more than two hatches, except their eggs be
robbed, which obliges them to renew their labours; and in this way they may be
made to lay four times in the year. The mother feeds the young by diſgorging
into their bill what had been prepared and half-digeſted in her craw.</p>
               <p>After the hatching is over, and the family raiſed, the Linnets
go in numerous flocks, which are formed about the end of Auguſt, when the
hemp is arrived at maturity; and at this time ſixty have been caught in one
drawing of the net<note n="*" place="bottom">The lark-net may be uſed, but it
ought to be rather ſmaller and cloſer. One or two cock Linnets ſhould be
had for calls. Chaffinches, and other ſmall birds, are often caught with the
Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</note>, and out of theſe were forty males. They continue to live
thus in ſociety during the whole winter; they fly very crowded, alight and
riſe together, perch on the ſame trees, and about the <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1084600104:72"/>
beginning of ſpring they all chant at once; they lodge during the night in
oaks, and elms, whoſe leaves, though dry, have not yet fallen; they are
ſeen too on the linden-trees and pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and feed upon the buds; they live
alſo upon all kinds of ſmall ſeeds, particularly thoſe of thiſtles,
&amp;c. and hence they haunt indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately uncultivated lands, and
ploughed fields. Their walk is a ſort of hopping; but their flight is
continued and uniform, and not like that of the ſparrow, compoſed of a
ſucceſſion of jerks.</p>
               <p>The ſong of the Linnet is announced by a ſort of prelude. In
Italy the Linnets of Abruzzo and of the Marche of Ancona are preferred. It is
generally ſuppoſed in France that the warble of the Red Linnet is
ſuperior to that of the Gray. This is conſonant to reaſon; for a bird
which has formed its ſong in the boſom of liberty, and from the impulſe
of its inward feelings, muſt have more affecting and expreſſive airs,
than one that has no object but only to cheer its languor, or to give the
neceſſary exerciſe to its vocal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
               <p>The females are naturally deſtitute of ſong, nor can they
ever acquire it. The adult males caught in the net profit as little by
inſtruction; and the young males taken out of the neſt are alone
ſuſceptible of education. They are fed with oatmeal-gruel, and rape-ſeed
ground with milk or ſugared-water; and in the evening they are whiſtled to
in the weak light of a candle, <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1084600104:73"/> care being taken to
articulate diſtinctly the words which they are wanted to repeat. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
to begin them, they are held on the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before a mirror, in which they view
their image, and believe they ſee another bird of their own ſpecies; they
ſoon fancy that they hear the notes of a companion, and this illuſion
produces a ſort of emulation which animates their ſongs, and quickens their
progreſs. It is ſuppoſed that they ſing more in a ſmall cage than in
a large one.</p>
               <p>The very name of theſe birds points out their proper food.
They are called Linnets <hi>(Linariae)</hi> becauſe they prefer lint-ſeed;
to this are added the ſeeds of panic, of rape, of hemp, of millet, of
Canary-graſs, of raddiſh, of cabbage, of poppy<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner ſays that if poppy-ſeeds alone be given for food
either to Linnets or Goldfinches, they will become blind.</note>, of plantain,
of beet, and ſometimes thoſe of melon bruiſed. From time to time they
have ſweet cake, prickly-ſorrel, chickweed, ſome ears of wheat, oats
pounded, and even a little ſalt; but all theſe muſt be properly varied.
They break the ſmall grains in their bill, and reject the ſhell; they ought
to have very little hemp-ſeed, for it fattens them too much; and this
exceſſive fat occaſions their death, or at leaſt renders them unfit for
ſinging. In thus feeding and raiſing them one's ſelf, we ſhall not only
teach them what airs we chuſe with a Canary-whiſtle, a flageolet, &amp;c.
but we ſhall tame them. <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1084600104:74"/> Olina adviſes to ſhelter
them from cold, and even to employ remedies for their diſeaſes; that we
ought for inſtance to put in their cage little bits of plaſter to prevent
coſtiveneſs, to which they are ſubject: he directs oxymel, ſuccory,
&amp;c. in caſes of aſthma, phthiſic<note n="*" place="bottom">The captive
Linnets are alſo ſubject to the epilepſy, and the boil. Some ſay that
they can ſcarcely ever be cured of this boil; others direct to puncture it
ſeaſonably, and pour wine into the wound.</note>, and certain
convulſions, or beatings with the bill. This laſt, however, I ſhould
ſuppoſe, is only a kind of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſing; the little animal, overcome by
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings, makes the moſt violent efforts to communicate its
ſentiments. At any rate we muſt attend much to the choice and quality of
the grain that is given it, and obſerve great cleanlineſs in its food,
drink, and volery; when ſuch care is taken, the bird may live in confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
five or ſix years, according to Olina; and much longer according to
others<note n="†" place="bottom">There is one at Montbeillard that is
certainly known to be ſeventeen years old.</note>. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
thoſe who are kind to them, become fond of them, alight on them out of
preference, and behold them with an affectionate air. If we would abuſe their
docility, we might even make them draw water; for they acquire habits as
readily as the Siſkin and Goldfinch. They begin to moult about the dog-days,
and ſometimes much later: a Linnet and a Siſkin have been known not to drop
their feathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1084600104:75"/> October; they had ſung till that
time, and their muſic was ſuperior to that of any other bird in the ſame
volery; and their moult, though late in the ſeaſon, was expeditious and
eaſy.</p>
               <p>The Linnet is a pulverulent bird, and it would be proper to
ſtrew in the bottom of the cage a layer of fine ſand, and renew it
occaſionally; there ought alſo to be a ſmall bath.—The total length
of the bird is five inches and a few lines; its alar extent nearly nine inches;
its bill five lines; its tail two inches, ſomewhat forked, and ſtretching
an inch beyond the wings.</p>
               <p>In the male the top of the head and the breaſt are red; the
throat, and the under-part of the body, ruſty-white; the upper-part,
cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut; almoſt all the feathers of the tail and of the wings are black,
edged with white; and hence when the wings are cloſed there is a white ray
parallel to the feathers. The female has commonly none of the red that we have
mentioned; and the plumage is more varied than in the male.<note n="A" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>The two kinds of Linnets which Buffon conceives to be
originally the ſame, are diſtinguiſhed by ſyſtematic
writers:—</p> 
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Common Linnet,</hi> called ſometimes the
<hi>Gray Linnet.</hi> It is the <hi>Fringilla Linota</hi> of Gmelin; the
<hi>Linaria</hi> of Ray, Willughby. Briſſon, Friſch, &amp;c. The German
name is <hi>Flacks-Finch,</hi> that is <hi>Flax-Finch;</hi> the Italian,

                        </gap>. The character given by
Briſſon is:— 
<q rend="inline">"It is of a duſky cheſnut, and beneath
tawny white; its wings are marked by a longitudinal white ſtripe; its
tail-quills are black, edged with white."</q> In the beginning of the ſpring
the breaſt of the male is of a roſe-crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon colour, which does not take
place in the female. It builds its neſt with moſs and bents, and lines it
with wool and hair; lays five eggs.</p> 
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Greater Red-headed Linnet,</hi> or
<hi>Red-Poll,</hi> which Buffon terms <hi>The Greater Vine-Linnet.</hi> It is
the <hi>Fringilla Cannabina</hi> of Linnaeus, or the <hi>Hemp-Finch;</hi> the
<hi>Linaria Rubra</hi> of Geſner, Ray, Briſſon, &amp;c. The German name
is <hi>Hänfling,</hi> or <hi>Hemp-bird;</hi> and the Italian <hi>Fanello
Marino,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Linnet.</hi> It is thus characterized by
Briſſon:— 
<q rend="inline">"It is of a duſky-cheſnut, the margins
of its fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more dilute, and beneath of a tawny-white; its wings marked
with a white longitudinal ſtripe; its tail-quills black, the whole of their
borders white."</q> The Linnaean character:— 
<q rend="inline">"The primary quills of its wings, and
thoſe of the tail, black, and white at both the edges."</q> It is found both
in Europe and in America. It is ſmaller than the preceding, and is gregarious
in winter. The female has neither the red ſpot on the crown, nor the
bluſh-coloured breaſt. It neſtles on the ground. It is a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
bird, and quite cheerful a few minutes after it is caught.</p> 
                     <p>The opinion of our ingenious author with reſpect to the
identity of the ſpecies of the Red Poll, and of the Common Linnet, is very
plauſible; but it ſeems not altogether well founded. The Red Poll is
ſmaller than the Linnet; it neſtles on the ground, while the latter breeds
in furze and thorn-hedges. The egg of the Linnet is of a very faint blue,
dotted with ruſty ſpecks, and interſperſed with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute brown
ſtreaks. The egg of the Red Poll is a very faint green, ſprinkled with
ruſty dots, and rather ſharp at the ſmall end.</p>

                  <p>Little is known with regard to this bird, yet enough to
indicate its affinity to the Linnet. It <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1084600104:78"/> is of the ſame
ſize, it feeds upon the ſame ſeeds, it flies alſo in numerous flocks,
and has eggs of the ſame colour: its tail is forked, the upper-part of its
body of a deep brown, the breaſt rufous, ſpeckled with brown, and the belly
white. It lays indeed three or four eggs only, according to Geſner, and its
legs are red. But was Geſner accurately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the number of eggs?
and with regard to the red colour of the legs, we have ſeen, and we ſhall
have other oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of being convinced, that this property is far from
being foreign to Linnets, eſpecially to thoſe in their natural ſtate. The
analogy appears even amidſt the differences, and I am inclined to believe,
that when the Straſburg Finch is better known, it may be referred as a
variety derived from climate, ſituation, &amp;c. to the common Linnet<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character:—

                  <p>This bird is found in the mountainous part of Derbyſhire in
England<note n="*" place="bottom">May not this be the ſecond Linnet mentioned
by Geſner, and after him by Schwenckfeld, which is more ſhy than the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Linnet, has an inferior ſong, and inhabits arid mountains, at leaſt
if we judge from the name that he gives it, <hi>Stein Haënfling (Stone
Linnet)?</hi>
                     </note>: it is larger than the ordinary ſort, and its bill
proportionally more ſlender. The red, which appears on the head and breaſt
of the common cock Linnet, occurs in the male of this ſpecies on the rump. In
other reſpects the plumage is nearly the ſame. The breaſt and throat are
variegated with black and white; the head with black and cinereous, and the
back with black and ruſty. The wings have a tranſverſe white ray, which
is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, being on a black ground; it is formed by the great coverts
which are tipt with white. The tail is two inches and a half long, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of twelve brown quills, of which the lateral ones have a white edging, which is
broader the nearer the quill lies to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that the Mountain Linnet has a forked tail, and
that its warble is pleaſant, though <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1084600104:80"/> Willughby does not
expreſsly mention theſe circumſtances. But he reckons theſe two
characters peculiar to the Linnet, with which he ranges it. If we be permitted
to draw this inference, we might conſider the Mountain Linnet as only a
variety reſulting from climate or ſituation.<note n="A" place="bottom">The
Mountain Linnet advances during the winter in flocks to the ſouthern parts of
England, and perhaps breeds in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern counties. It is larger than the

                  <p>When we treat of birds whoſe colours are ſo variable as in
the preſent, we ſhould fall into numberleſs miſtakes, if we
conſidered them as ſpecific characters. We have already ſeen that 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1084600104:81"/> the common Linnet, in the ſtate of liberty, was marked
with red on the head and breaſt; that the captive Linnet had the ſame
colour only on the breaſt, and that concealed; that the Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg Linnet
had it on the legs; and that the Mountain Linnet was painted with it on the
rump. Briſſon ſays, that what he calls the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vine Linnet is red on
the head and breaſt; and Geſner adds, on the rump. Willughby mentions a
ſmall Linnet which had a red ſpot on the head, and in that circumſtance
reſembled the two deſcribed by Aldrovandus, though it differed in other
reſpects. Laſtly, the <hi>Cabaret</hi> of Briſſon was marked with red
on the head and rump, but that of Friſch had none on the head. It is obvious,
that a great part of theſe varieties is owing to the ſeaſons and the
circumſtances in which theſe birds have been ſeen. If in the middle of
ſpring, they were clothed in their richeſt colours; if during the moulting
ſeaſon, the red had diſappeared; if immediately after, it was not yet
reſumed. If they were kept in a cage, the change would be in proportion to
the length of their confinement; and as the feathers of the different parts of
the body would drop at different times, there would be abundant ſource of
diverſity. In this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, we are obliged, in order to determine the
ſpecies, to recur to the more permanent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; the ſhape of the body,
the inſtincts, and habits. Applying this method, I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1084600104:82"/> only two kinds of birds that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the name of
Little Linnet: the one, which never ſings, appears but once in ſix or
ſeven years, arrives in numerous flocks, reſembles the Siſkin, &amp;c.:
it is the Little Vine Linnet of Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: the other is the Twite of this
article.</p>
                  <p>The younger Daubenton had for two or three years one of
theſe birds, which was caught in a net. It was at firſt very ſhy, but it
became gradually reconciled, and grew quite familiar. It ſeemed to prefer
hemp-ſeed for its food. It had a ſweet mellow note, much like that of the
Hedge Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaps. It loſt all its red the firſt year, and never recovered
it; the other colours ſuffered no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When ſick or in moult, its
bill was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to become immediately pale and yellowiſh; and as the
bird recovered, it paſſed through all the ſhades to its proper brown
caſt. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is not entirely deſtitute of brilliancy of plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; it
is marked with red on the head, but not on the rump. Though ſmaller than the
common hen Linnet, its voice is ſtronger and more varied. This bird is rare
both in Germany and in France. It flies rapidly, but never in large flocks; its
bill is rather more ſlender in proportion than that of the common Linnet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meaſures:</hi> the total length of the Twite is four
inches and a half; its wings are eight inches acroſs; its bill rather more
than four lines; its tail two inches: this is forked, and projects only eight
lines beyond the wings.</p>

                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1084600104:83"/> 
                     <hi>Colours:</hi> The upper-part of the
head and the rump are red; there is a reddiſh bar under the eyes; the
upper-part of the body is variegated with black and ruſt colour; the
under-part of the body ruſty, ſpotted with blackiſh below the throat; the
belly is white; the legs brown, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times black. The nails are very long,
and that of the hind toe is longer than the toe itſelf.<note n="A" place="bottom">Linnaeus makes the Twite a variety of the Mountain Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; but
Mr. Latham conceives it to be more related to the Red Poll. 
<q rend="inline">"It is variegated above, rufous below, the
abdomen whitiſh, the eye-brows and the bar on the wings tawny, the crown and
rump red."</q> It is about four inches and a half long. Briſſon deſcribes
it 
<q rend="inline">"as blackiſh above and varied with rufous,
below tawny; the belly whitiſh; the ſtripe above the eyes ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fous; having
ſpots between the bill and the eyes and under the throat of a duſky
blackiſh colour, the crown and rump red in the male; (the crown red in the
female;) the tranſverſe bar on the wings of a white-rufous; the tail-quills
duſky, the whole of the edges tawny."</q> If we were to judge from the egg of
the Twite, we ſhould regard it as a variety of the Red Poll. The egg of the
Twite, though rather ſmaller than that of the Red Poll, is of the ſame
ſhape and colour; only the dots are orange, ſmaller, and more thickly
ſpread.</note>

                     </note>.</head>
                  <p>ALL that is known with regard to the hiſtory of this bird
is, that it is found in the kingdom of Angola; that it is very ſamiliar; that
it is ranked among the fineſt warblers of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that its ſong
is not the ſame with that of our Linnet. The neck, the upper-part of the head
and of the body, are variegated with two ſorts of brown; the rump has a
beautiful ſpot of yellow, <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1084600104:85"/> which extends to the quills of
the tail: theſe quills are brown, edged and tipt with light gray, as alſo
the quills of the wings, and their great and middle coverts. The ſides of the
head are of a light ruſt colour, and there is a brown ſtreak below the
eyes; the under-part of the body and the ſides are ſpotted with brown on a
lighter ground.</p>
                  <p>Edwards, who firſt deſcribed this bird, and who has given
a figure of it at the bottom of Pl. 129, is inclined to think it is a female of
another that is repreſented at the top of the ſame plate. Thisother bird is
called <hi>Negral</hi> or <hi>Taba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> and its ſong is much like that
of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goline. For my own part, I muſt confeſs, that the ſong<note n="*" place="bottom">Daines Barrington ſays, that the Vengoline excels in point
of ſong all the birds of Aſia, Africa, and America, except only the
American Mocking Bird.</note> of this makes me doubt of its being a female. I
ſhould rather ſuppoſe that they are two males of the ſame ſpecies,
but from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent climates, where each would have a diſtinct name; or at
leaſt that they are two males of the ſame climate, one of which being bred
in a volery, had loſt the luſtre of its plumage, and the other not being
caught before it was adult, or having been kept but a ſhort time in the cage,
had preſerved its colours better. In fact the colours of the Negral are
richer and more mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than thoſe of the Vengoline. The throat, the face,
and the ſtreak below the eyes, are black; <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1084600104:86"/> the cheeks
white, the breaſt and all the under-part of the body of an orange colour,
without ſpecks, and which aſſume a deeper ſhade under the belly and the
tail. Theſe two birds are of the ſize of our Linnet; and Edwards adds, that
they have the ſame aſpect.</p>

                  <head>IV. The DUSKY FINCH.</head>
                  <p>Our knowledge of this bird is drawn from Edwards. Almoſt all
its feathers are blackiſh, edged with a lighter colour, which has a reddiſh
caſt on the upper-part of the body: the general colour that reſults from
this mixture is deep brown, though varied. It has a cinereous tint on the
breaſt and rump; the bill is alſo cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, and the legs are brown.</p>
                  <p>I preſume that Briſſon ought not to confound this bird
with <hi>the Little Brown Sparrow</hi> of Cateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, whoſe plumage is of an
uniform brown, without any moulting, and therefore quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. But the
difference of climate is ſtill greater; for Edwards's Duſky Linnet came
probably from Brazil, perhaps even from Africa; whereas Cateſby's <hi>Little
Brown Sparrow</hi> is found in Carolina and Virginia, where it breeds and

               <p>THIS is the name given by bird-fanciers to a Carolina bird,
which others call the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but which muſt not be confounded
with the Biſhop of Brazil, which is a Tanagre. I place it near the Linnets,
becauſe in the time of moulting it is ſo much like theſe, as to be
miſtaken for them, and the female at all ſeaſons reſembles them. The
moult happens in the months of September and October; but the period varies as
in Bunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in many other birds: the Miniſter is ſaid even to drop
its feathers thrice a-year, in which circumſtance it alſo reſembles the
Bunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Bengals, and Senegals, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When clothed in its fineſt attire, it is ſky-blue upon a
violet ground; the vane of the wings is of a deep blue, with deep brown in the
male, and with a greeniſh tint in the female; which is ſufficient to

               <p>ALL travellers, and after them the naturaliſts, have agreed,
that theſe ſmall birds change their colours in moulting. Some even add
intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars which we ſhould wiſh to aſcertain; that the
varieties of plumage are confined entirely to five principal colours, black,
blue, green, yellow, and red; and that the Bengals never aſſume more than
one at a time. Yet perſons who have had an opportunity of obſerving theſe
birds in France, and of watching their alterations for a courſe of years,
aſſert that they have only one annual moult, and never change their
colour<note n="†" place="bottom">M. Mauduit, well known for his
enlightened taſte in Natural Hiſtory, and for his excellent collection of
birds, obſerved a Red Senegal that lived more than a year without changing
his plumage. Château ſays the ſame of all the Bengals which
paſſed through his hands.</note>. This apparent contradiction may be
explained by the difference of climates. That of Aſia and Africa, the native
regions of theſe birds, is more powerful than ours, and may have greater
influence upon their plumage. But the Bengals are not the only birds which
undergo the change; for, according to Merolla, the Sparrow in Africa becomes
red in the rainy ſeaſon, <pb n="79" facs="tcp:1084600104:93"/> and many others are ſubject
to ſimilar alterations. At any rate, an arrangement founded on the colours of
the plumage muſt in the preſent caſe be totally uncertain; ſince, in
their native climate, at leaſt, theſe pretended characters would only be
momentary, depending on the ſeaſon when the birds was killed. On the other
hand, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, which fluctuates in Africa and Aſia, is invariable
in Europe; and it becomes difficult to avoid compounding varieties with
ſpecies. I ſhall follow therefore the received opinions, and allot a
ſeparate article to each bird which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears obviouſly diſtinct, but
without pretending to decide the number of real ſpecies, which can be only
the work of time.</p>
               <p>We ſhould be much miſtaken if we inferred from the names of
theſe birds, that they are confined to Bengal and Senegal: they are ſpread
through the greateſt part of Aſia and Africa, and even in many of the
adjacent iſlands, ſuch as thoſe of Madagaſcar, Bourbon, France, and
Java, &amp;c. We may even expect ſoon to find them multiplied in America; for
De Sonini lately ſet at liberty a great number of them in the Iſle of
Cayenne, and afterwards ſaw them cheerful and lively, ſtrongly diſpoſed
to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize in a foreign ſoil, and perpetuate their race<note n="*" place="bottom">A few years ago a Red Senegal was killed at Cayenne in a
ſavanna; it had certainly been carried thither by ſome navigators.</note>.
We may hope that theſe new coloniſts, whoſe plumage is ſo variable,
will alſo ſuffer the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1084600104:94"/> of an American
climate, and other varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be produced, more fit however to decorate
our cabinets than to enrich Natural Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Bengals are familiar and deſtructive birds: in a word,
they are real Sparrows. They viſit the houſes and even appear in the middle
of the villages, and alight in numerous bodies in the fields ſowed with
millet<note n="*" place="bottom">Travellers inſorm us, that the negroes eat
certain ſmall birds entire with their feathers, and theſe birds reſemble
Linnets. I imagine that Senegals are of the number, for ſome Senegals in the
time of moulting are like Linnets. Beſides, it is ſaid that the negroes eat
the ſmall birds entire, only to retaliate for the damage done among their
crops, theſe neſtling in the midſt of the ſowed fields.</note>; for
they prefer this grain: they are alſo fond of bathing.</p>
               <p>In Senegal, they are caught under a calebaſh, or large gourd,
which is placed upon the ground, and raiſed a little by a ſhort prop, to
which a long cord is faſtened; a few grains of millet ſerve for the bait.
The perſon who watches their motions without being perceived, draws at the
proper time, and ſecures whatever is under the calebaſh; Bengals, Senegals,
and ſmall black Sparrows with white bellies, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">I owe the detail of this ſport to M. de Sonini.</note> Theſe
birds are tranſported with difficulty, and can hardly be reconciled to a
different climate; but when once naturalized, they live ſix or ſeven years,
that is longer than many ſpecies proper to the country. They have even bred
in Holland; and the ſame ſucceſs would undoubtedly be had 
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1084600104:95"/> in colder places; for theſe birds are very gentle and
ſocial, and often careſs each other, and above all, the males and females
ſit near one another, and ſing in concert. It is added, the ſong of the
female is not much inferior to that of the male.</p>

               <p>AS the inſtincts and habits are nearly the ſame in the whole
of this family of birds, I ſhall content myſelf, in this and the following
articles, to ſubjoin to the general account, the delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peculiar
features of each. In caſes ſuch as the preſent, where the principal
object is to convey ideas of the richneſs and variety of the plumage, we
ought to quit the pen for the pencil; at leaſt, we muſt imitate the painter
in deſcribing not only the forms and lineaments, <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1084600104:96"/> but in
repreſenting the ſportive fluctuation of tints, their changing
ſucceſſion and combination, and above all in expreſſing action,
motion, and life.</p>
               <p>The Bengal has on each ſide of its head a ſort of purple
creſcent which lies under the eyes, and marks the phyſiognomy of this
little bird.</p>
               <p>The throat is light blue, and the ſame colour ſpreads over
all the lower parts of the body, as far as the end of the tail, and even over
the upper coverts. All the upper-part of the body, including the wings, is of a
pleaſant gray.</p>
               <p>In ſome individuals, this ſame gray, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lighter, is
the colour of the belly and of the lower coverts of the tail.</p>
               <p>In other ſpecimens brought from Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinia, this gray had
a tinge of red on the belly.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in others there is no purple creſcent under the
eyes; and this variety, known by the name of <hi>Blue Cord</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cordon Bleu,</hi> Knight of the order of the Holy
Ghoſt.</note>, is more common than that firſt deſcribed. It is ſaid to
be a female; but, as it is ſo frequent, I ſhould rather ſuppoſe that
the appearance is owing to the difference of age or climate. Mr. Bruce, who has
ſeen this bird in Abyſſinia, poſitively aſſures us, that the two
red ſpots are not found in the female, and that all her colours are leſs
brilliant. He adds, that <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1084600104:97"/> the male has an agreeable warble,
but he never remarked that of the female: in both, the bill and the legs are
reddiſh.</p>
               <p>Edwards has figured and coloured a <hi>Blue Cord (the
Blue-bellied Finch)</hi> which was brought from the coaſt of Angola, where
the Portugueſe called it <hi>Azulinha.</hi> It differed from the preceding;
the upper-part of the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a brown cinereous, ſlightly tinged with
purple, the bill of a deep fleſh colour, and the legs brown. The plumage of
the female was of a cinereous brown, with a flight tinge of blue on the
lower-part of the body only. It would ſeem to be a variety from the climate,
in which neither ſex has the red ſpot under the eyes; and this accounts for
the frequency of the <hi>Blue Cords.</hi> It is a very lively bird. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
remarks that its bill is like that of the Goldfinch. He takes no notice of its
ſong, not having an opportunity of hearing it.</p>
               <p>The Bengal is of the ſize of the <hi>Sizerin;</hi> its total
length is four inches nine lines; its bill four lines; its tail two inches,
unequally taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſiſting of twelve quills; its extent ſix or

                  <p>Brown is the predominant colour of this bird; but it is more

                  <p>Of all the Bengals which I have ſeen, this is the moſt
ſpeckled. The whole upper part of the body, the ſuperior coverts of the
tail and wings, and the quills of the wings next the back, were ſprinkled
with points; the wings were brown, and the lateral quills of the tail black,
edged with white. Brown mixed with a dull red was ſpread over all the upper
part of the body, including the coverts of the tail, and even under the belly;
a red not ſo duſky ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over all the reſt of the under-part of the
body, and the ſides of the head; the bill was alſo of a dull red, and the
legs of a light yellow.</p>
                  <p>The female, according to Briſſon, is never punctured; it
differs alſo from the male, as its neck, breaſt, and belly, are of a
pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yellow, and the throat white. According to other obſervers, who had many
opportunities of <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1084600104:101"/> repeatedly ſeeing theſe birds alive,
the female was entirely brown, and without ſpots. Is this a variety of
plumage, or a difference of deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for the latter is no ſmall
ſource of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in natural hiſtory. Willughby ſaw ſeveral of
theſe birds which came from the Eaſt Indies, and, as we may expect, found
ſeveral differences among the individuals; ſome had black wings; in others
the breaſt was of that colour; in others the breaſt and belly were
blackeſt; in others the legs whitiſh: in all the nails were very long, and
more incurvated than thoſe of the lark. There is reaſon to believe that
ſome of theſe birds were in moult; for I obſerved one in which the
lower-belly was blackiſh, and all the reſt of the plumage indecided, as
happens when the feathers are dropped, the colours pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the ſpecies
being impreſſed, but not well diſcriminated.</p>
                  <p>The ſpecimen deſcribed by Briſſon came from the
iſland of Java. Thoſe obſerved by Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton were brought from India;
their warble was very pleaſant; ſeveral of them were kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the
ſame cage, becauſe they diſliked the ſociety of other birds.</p>
                  <p>The Speckled Bengal is of a ſize intermediate to the two

                  <p>I. I have ſeen one of theſe birds which had been killed in
Cayenne in a ſavanna, and the only one that has been ſeen in that country.
It probably had been carried thither by ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, and had
eſcaped from its cage. It differed in ſome reſpects from the preceding;
the coverts of its wings were ſlightly edged with red; the bill was entirely
of that colour; the legs only reddiſh: and what ſhews the cloſe analogy
between the Bengals and Senegals, the breaſt and ſides were ſprinkled
with ſome white points.</p>

                  <p>II. The DANBIK of Mr. Bruce. This bird is very common in
Abyſſinia, and partakes of the qualities of the two preceding. It is of the
ſame ſize. The red colour, which is ſpread over all the anterior part,
does not deſcend to the legs, as in the Senegal, but it extends over the
coverts of the wings, where a few white points are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived likewiſe on the
ſides of the breaſt. The bill is purple, its upper and lower ridge
bluiſh, and the legs cinereous. The male ſings agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. The female is of
an almoſt uniform brown, and has very little purple.</p>

                  <p>It is radiated tranſverſely as far as the end of the tail
with brown and gray, and the <hi>ſtriae</hi> are the more delicate as they
are nearer the head. The general complexion is much lighter on the lower part
of the body; it is alſo ſhaded with roſe-colour, and there is a red
oblong ſpot under the belly; the lower coverts of the tail are black without
any rays, but ſome traces can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on the wing-quills, which are
brown; the bill is red, and there is a ſtripe, or rather a bar of that colour
on the eyes.</p>
                  <p>I have been aſſured that the female is exactly like the
male; but the differences which I have myſelf obſerved in many individuals,
and thoſe which have been noticed by others, create ſome 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1084600104:105"/> doubts of the perfect ſimilarity of the ſexes. I have
ſeen ſeveral which came from the Cape, in ſome of which the upper-part of
the body was more or leſs of a deep brown, and the under more or leſs
reddiſh; in others the upper-part of the head had no rays. In that figured by
Edwards, Pl. 179, the rays conſiſted of two browns; and the coverts below
the tail were not black, which is alſo the caſe with what we have
repreſented N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 157, fig. 2. Laſtly, in the ſpecimen delineated at the
top of Pl. 354, the rays of the under-part of the body are ſpread upon a
brown ground; and not only the lower coverts of the tail are black, as in that
deſcribed by Briſſon, but the lower belly is of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject obſerved by Briſſon came from Senegal. The
two which Edwards examined were brought from the Eaſt Indies; and moſt of
thoſe which I have ſeen were brought from the Cape of Good Hope. Among ſo
many differences of the plumage remarked between theſe, ſome muſt depend
upon the diſtinction of ſex.</p>
                  <p>The average length of theſe birds is about four inches and a
half; the bill is three or four lines; the alar extent ſix inches, and the
tail two inches, unequally tapered, and compoſed of twelve quills.</p>

                  <p>Brown is the predominant colour of the head, the back, the
wings, and the quills of the tail; the under-part of the body is light gray,
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a light fulvous, but always tinged with reddiſh; the rump is
red, and alſo the bill; the legs are red; ſometimes the baſe of the bill
is edged with black, and the rump ſprinkled with white points, and ſo are
the coverts of the wings. Such was the Serevan ſent from the Iſle of France
by Sonnerat, under the name of <hi>Bengal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That called <hi>Serevan</hi> by Commerſon had all the

neither its bill nor its rump was red, and not a ſingle ſpeck could be

                  <p>Other birds cloſely related to this, and ſent by

                  <p>China is not the only country from which this bird is brought;
that engraved by Edwards came from Malacca, and in all probability it might be
found in the intermediate countries. There is reaſon however to doubt whether
it exiſts in America, and whether ſo ſmall a bird could traverſe the
immenſe oceans which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the continents; at leaſt it differs ſo
much from the Maias, the American birds which it the neareſt approaches, as
to require a diſtinct name. In fact its properties are not the ſame; for
though it be rather larger, it has its wings and tail ſomewhat ſhorter, and
its bill as ſhort; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, its plumage is different, and much inferior in
luſtre.</p>
                  <p>In the Maian, all the upper-part of the body is a reddiſh
cheſnut; the breaſt, and all the under-part of the body, is of an almoſt
uniform blackiſh, not quite ſo deep beneath the tail; the bill is of a
lead-colour; a ſort of light gray cowl <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1084600104:111"/> covers the head,
and falls below the neck; the lower coverts of the wings are of the ſame
light gray, and the legs are fleſh-coloured.</p>
                  <p>The Maian of Briſſon differs from this; its breaſt being
of a light brown, ſome of the firſt feathers of the wings being edged with
white, the bill and legs being gray, &amp;c. Theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are too
ſtriking to be imputed to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of deſcription, eſpecially if we

But as the diſpoſition to ſnap is not peculiar to the Chaffinch, but

ſeaſon they never ſing, except in fine days, which ſeldom then occur.
During the reſt of the time they lodge concealed in cloſe hedges, in oaks
that have not ſhed all their leaves, in evergreens, and even in holes of
rocks, where they are ſometimes found dead when the weather is
exceſſively ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. Thoſe which migrate into other climates
aſſemble often in prodigious flocks; but whither do they retire? Friſch
ſuppoſes that their retreat lies in the northern regions: his reaſons
are; 1. That on their return, they bring with them white Chaffinches, which are
hardly to be met with, except in thoſe climates; 2. That they never lead
young ones in their train, which would be the caſe, if, during their
abſence, they lived in a warm country, where they might be diſpoſed to
breed; 3. That they can bear cold, except ſnow, which covering the fields,
deprives them in part of their ſubſiſtence<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.—Aldrovandus ſays, that in Italy, when there is
much ſnow and the froſt very intenſe, the Chaffinches cannot fly, and are
caught by the hand; but this weakneſs may ariſe from inanition, and that
again from the abundance of ſnow. Olina alleges, that in the ſame country
the Chaffinches retire to the hilly tracts during the ſummer. Hebert has
ſeen many of them in that ſeaſon among the higheſt mountains of Bugey,
where they were as common as in the plains, and where they certainly do not
remain through the winter.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe arguments imply therefore, that there is a country in
the north where the earth is not robed in the winter; and ſuch is ſaid to
be the <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1084600104:115"/> deſarts of Tartary, where the ſnow falls
indeed, but is immediately ſwept away by the violence of the winds, and
extenſive tracts laid bare.</p>
               <p>A very remarkable circumſtance in the migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the

of thoſe of Sweden: that only the females remove to other climates, and the
males reſide in the country during the winter<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <q rend="inline">"They quit Switzerland in the winter,

<bibl>GESNER.</bibl>
                        </q> Linnaeus poſitively aſſerts,
that the female Chaffinches leave Sweden in flocks about the month of
September, that they direct their courſe to Holland, and return in the
ſpring to join their males which have wintered in Sweden.</p> 
                     <p>This ſingular remark is corroborated by Mr. White, who
found that the vaſt flocks of Chaffinches which appear in his neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
about Chriſtmas, are almoſt entirely hens. Yet, as he ſeems not to have
diſſected any, he might have been deceived by the change of plumage, which
is extremely probable.</p>
                  </note>. But have not theſe able naturaliſts been
miſled by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who informed them, and thoſe deceived by ſome
periodical change in the plumage of the females, occaſioned by cold, or other
accidents? This explanation ſeems more ſuited to Nature's general plan, and
more conformable to analogy, than to ſuppoſe that, at a certain fixed term,
the females ſeparate from mere caprice, and travel into a diſtant climate,
when their native ſoil can afford them ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>The migrations vary in different countries. Aldrovandus
aſſures us, that the Chaffinches ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom breed near Bologna, but almoſt
all depart <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1084600104:116"/> about the end of winter, and return the
ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing autumn. On the other hand, I find from Willughby, that they
continue the whole year in England, and that few birds are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>They are ſpread through the whole of Europe, from the ſhores
of the Baltic and Sweden, where they are frequent, and neſtle, to the Straits
of Gibraltar, and even the coaſts of Africa<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The Chaffinch is a lively bird, and perpetually in motion; and
this circumſtance, joined to the ſprightlineſs of its ſong, has given
riſe to the proverbial ſaying, <hi>gay as a Chaffinch.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to
chant very early in the ſpring, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days before the Nightingale,
and gives over about the ſummer ſolſtice. Its ſong has merited an
analyſis: and it is diſtinguiſhed into the prelude, the quavering, and
the cloſe<note n="†" place="bottom">The prelude is, according to
Friſch, compoſed of three ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar notes or ſtrokes; the quaver, of
ſeven different notes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending; and the cloſe, of two notes. Lottinger
has alſo made ſome obſervations on this ſubject.

has deſtined the Chaffinches to be ſongſters of the woods; let us repair
then to the grove, to taſte and enjoy the beauties of their muſic.</p>
               <p>If a young Chaffinch taken from the neſt be educated under a
Canary, a Nightingale, &amp;c. it will have the ſong of its inſtructors:
more than one inſtance<note n="‡" place="bottom">This facility in

has been known of this; but they have never been brought to whiſtle our
tunes:—they never depart ſo wide from nature.</p>
               <p>The Chaffinches, beſide their ordinary warble, have a certain
tremulous expreſſion oflove, which they can utter in the ſpring, and
alſo another cry which is unpleaſant, and ſaid to portend rain<note n="§" place="bottom">In the German language a word is appropriated to denote
this: it is <hi>Schircken.</hi>
                  </note>. It has been remarked too, that they
never ſing better or longer than when, from ſome accident, they have loſt
their ſight<note n="‖" place="bottom">They are liable to this accident,

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1084600104:118"/> no ſooner was this obſervation made, than the art
was diſcovered of rendering them blind. The lower eyelid is connected to the
upper by a ſort of artificial cicatrix made by touching ſlightly and
repeatedly the edges with a wire heated red-hot in the fire, and taking care
not to hurt the ball of the eye. They muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this ſingular
operation by confining them for ten or twelve days to the cage, and then
keeping them ſhut up with the cage in a cheſt night and day, to accuſtom
them to feed in the dark<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner aſſerts, that if
the Chaffinches be kept thus ſhut up through the whole ſummer, and not let
out of their priſon till the beginning of autumn, they ſing during the
latter ſeaſon, which would otherwiſe not happen. Darkneſs rendered them
dumb, but return of light is to them a ſecond ſpring.</note>. Theſe blind
Chaffinches are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable ſingers, and they are preferred as calls to
decoy wild Chaffinches into the ſnares: theſe are alſo caught with
bird-lime and with different kinds of nets, and among others thoſe for larks,
but the meſhes muſt be ſmaller in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſize of the
bird.</p>
               <p>The time for the ſport is, when the Chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finches fly in
numerous flocks, either in autumn before their departure, or in ſpring on
their return. We muſt, as much as poſſible, chooſe calm weather, for
they keep lower and hear better the call. They do not eaſily bend to
cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; they ſcarcely will eat any thing for the firſt two or three
days; they ſtrike their bill <pb n="102" facs="tcp:1084600104:119"/> continually againſt the
ſticks of the cage, and often languiſh to death<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe caught with lime-twigs often die the inſtant they are
taken.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds conſtruct their neſt very round and compact,
and place it in the cloſeſt trees or buſhes; ſometimes they build it
even in our gardens upon the fruit-trees, and conceal it ſo artfully that we
can hardly perceive it, though quite nigh. It is compoſed of white moſs and
ſmall roots on the outſide, and lined with wool, hairs, ſpiders-webs, and
feathers. The female lays five or ſix eggs, which are reddiſh gray,
ſprinkled with blackiſh ſpots, more frequent near the large end. The male
never deſerts his mate in the time of hatching; he ſits at night always at
hand; and if during the day he remove to a ſhort diſtance, it is only to
procure food. Jealouſy has perhaps ſome ſhare in this exceſſive
aſſiduity; for theſe birds are of an amorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion: when two males
meet in an orchard in the ſpring, they fight obſtinately, till one of them
is vanquiſhed and expelled: and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat is ſtill more fierce if they be
lodged in the ſame volery with only a ſingle female.</p>
               <p>The parents feed their brood with caterpillars and inſects:
they alſo eat theſe themſelves, but their ordinary ſubſiſtence is
ſmall ſeeds, thoſe of the white thorn, of poppy, of burdock, of the
roſe-tree, and eſpecially beech-maſt, rape and <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1084600104:120"/>
hemp ſeed. They feed alſo upon wheat and even oats, and are expert in
ſhelling the grain to obtain the mealy ſubſtance. Though rather
obſtinate, they can in time be inſtructed like Goldfinches to perform
ſeveral little feats; they learn to employ their wings and feet to draw up
the cup when they want to eat or drink.</p>
               <p>The Chaffinch ſits oftener ſquatted than perched; it never
walks hopping, but trips lightly along the ground, and is conſtantly buſy
in picking up ſomething: its flight is unequal; but when its neſt is
attacked, it hovers above ſcreaming.</p>
               <p>This bird is ſomewhat ſmaller than our Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is too
well known to require a minute decription. The ſides of the head, the
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the neck, the breaſt, and the loins are of a wine colour: the
upper-part of the head and of the body cheſnut; the rump olive, and a white
ſpot on the wing. In the female the bill is more ſlender, and the colours
leſs bright than in the male; but in both ſexes the plumage is very
ſubject to vary. I have ſeen a hen Chaſſinch alive, caught on her eggs
the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May, which differed from that deſcribed by Briſſon: the
upper-part of its head and back was of a brown olive, a ſort of gray collar
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the neck behind, the belly and the lower coverts of the tail were
white, &amp;c. And of the males, ſome have the upper-part of the head 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1084600104:121"/> and neck cinereous, and others of a brown cheſnut; in
ſome the quills of the tail near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the two middle ones are edged with
white, and in others they are entirely black. Does age occaſion theſe
ſlight differences?</p>
               <p>A young Chaffinch was taken from its mother, when its
tail-quills were ſix lines in length, and the under-part of its body was like
that of its mother; and the upper-part of a brown cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous; the rump olive;
the wings were already marked with white rays: but the edges of the ſuperior
mandible were not yet ſcalloped near the point as in the adult males. This
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would lead me to ſuppoſe that the ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping which
occurs in many ſpecies is not the primary organization, but is afterwards
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the continual preſſure of the end of the lower mandible, which
is rather ſhorter, againſt the ſides of the upper.</p>
               <p>All the Chaffinches have the tail forked, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of twelve
quills; the ground colour of their plumage is dull cinereous, and the fleſh
is not good to eat. The period of their life is ſeven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Total length ſix and one-third inches; the bill ſix lines;
the alar extent near ten inches; the tail two and two-thirds, and extends about
ſixteen lines beyond the wings.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of

Mountain Finch. The following are the reaſons which incline me to this
opinion. The ancients never made complete deſcriptions, but ſeized a

habits, and marked it by an epithet. The <hi>Oroſpiza,</hi> ſays

like the <hi>Spiza;</hi> it is ſomewhat ſmaller; its neck is blue; and
laſtly, it inhabits the mountains: but all theſe are properties of the
Chaffinch, and ſome of them belong to it excluſively.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is much like the Mountain Finch or Brambling, as
will appear from the compariſon; and all ſyſtematic writers have
claſſed them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="2">

ſmaller than the Brambling, according to naturaliſts, and which agrees with
my own obſervations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Chaffinch, the upper-parts of the head and of
the neck are of a bluiſh cinereous; whereas in the Brambling theſe are
varied with gloſſy black and yellowiſh gray.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We have already remarked, on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Olina,
that in Italy the Chaffinch retires in ſummer to breed among the mountains;
and, as the climate of Greece is little different from that of Italy, we may
infer from analogy, it will there alſo have the ſame habits<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch aſſerts that the Bramblings come from the mountains
in autumn, and when they return they direct their courſe to the north. The
Marquis de Piolenc, who has given me ſeveral notes on theſe birds,
aſſures me that they leave the mountains of Savoy and Dauphiny in October,
and do not return till February. Theſe periods correſpond well with the
time when they are ſeen to paſs and repaſs in Burgundy.—Perhaps
both theſe ſpecies reſemble each other in preferring
mountains.</note>.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, the <hi>Spiza</hi> of Ariſtotle appears to
reſort, according to that philoſopher, to the warm regions during ſummer,
and to prefer the cold climates in winter<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus poſitively aſſerts, that this takes place in the
neighbourhood of Bologna: Lottinger informs me, that ſome appear in Lorraine
from the end of Auguſt, but that large flocks arrive towards the end of
October, and even later.</note>. But this agrees better with the Brambling than
with the Chaffinches, ſince of theſe a great proportion never migrate,
while the former not only are birds of paſſage, but <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1084600104:127"/>
generally arrive in the depth of winter<note n="*" place="bottom">

different countries which they viſit. This is evinced by experience, and is
confirmed by the appellations of Winter-Finch, and Snow-Finch, which they have
received in various places.</p>
               <p>From all theſe conſiderations, it ſeems probable that the
Brambling is the <hi>Spiza</hi> of Ariſtotle, and the Chaffinch his
<hi>Oroſpiza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bramblings do not breed in our climates; they arrive in
different years in immenſe flocks. The time of their paſſage is the
autumn and winter: often they retire in eight or ten days, and ſometimes they
remain till the ſpring. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtay, they conſort with the
Chaffinches, and, like theſe, ſeek concealment in the thick foliage. Vaſt
bodies of them appeared in Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy in the winter of 1774, and other in

                     <p>Lottinger aſſerts perhaps too generally, that in the
day-time they ſpread through the foreſts of the plain, and in the evening
retire to the mountains. This conduct is not invariable, but ſeems to be
affected by ſituation and circumſtances.</p> 
                     <p> A flock of more than three hundred were ſeen this year in
our neighbourhood; it halted three or four days in the ſame place, which is
mountainous. They always alighted on the ſame cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-tree, and when

Never perhaps were ſo many of theſe birds ſeen in Lorraine, as in the
winter of 1765: more than ſix hundred dozen, ſays Lottinger, were killed
every night in the pine-foreſts, which are four or five leagues from
Sarbourg. The people were not at the pains to ſhoot them, they knocked them
down with ſwitches; and though this maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre laſted the whole winter,
the body was ſcarce perceptibly thinned. Willughby tells us, that many are
ſeen in the neighbourhood of Venice, no doubt in the time of paſſage; but
no where do they appear ſo regularly as in the foreſts of Weiſſemburg,
which are plentifully ſtocked with beeches, and conſequently afford
abundance of maſt, of which they are ſo fond, that they eat it day and
night; they live alſo on all ſorts of ſmall ſeeds. I ſuppoſe that
theſe birds remain in their native climate as long as they can procure the
proper food, and quit it only when ſcarcity obliges them to ſhift their
quarters; at leaſt, it is certain that the plenty of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſeeds
is not ſufficient to draw them to a country, and even to one with which they
are acquainted: for in 1774, when there was abundance of beech maſt in
Lorraine, the Bramblings did not appear, but took a different 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1084600104:129"/> route: however, in the following year, ſeveral flocks
were ſeen, though there was a ſcarcity of maſt<note n="*" place="bottom">I
owe thoſe facts to Mr. Lottinger.</note>. When they arrive among us, they are
not ſhy, but allow a perſon to go very near them. They fly cloſe
together, and alight and riſe in the ſame compact body; and for this
reaſon twelve or fifteen of them may be killed at one ſhot.</p>
               <p>When they feed in the ſields, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to perform
the ſame manoeuvres as the pigeons; a few always precede, and are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the reſt of the flock.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds, we ſee, are known and ſpread through all
parts of Europe; but they are not confined to our quarter of the globe. Edwards
obſerved ſome that were brought from Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's-bay, under the name of
<hi>Snow-birds;</hi> and people who traded to that country aſſured him that
they were the firſt which appeared every year on the return of ſpring,
before even the ſnows were melted.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Bramblings, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bitter, is
good to eat, and undoubtedly better than that of the Chaffinch. Their plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is alſo more varied, more beautiful, and more gloſſy; but their ſong is
far from being ſo pleaſant, and it has been compared to the ſcreech of

They have two cries; the one a ſort <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1084600104:130"/> of chirping, and
the other which they utter when they ſit on the ground reſembles that of
the Stone-chat, but is neither ſo ſtrong nor ſo clear. Though by nature
endowed with ſo few talents, theſe birds are ſuſceptible of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and when kept near another whoſe warble is more pleaſant,
their ſong gradually mellows, and comes to reſemble that which they
hear<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Olina.</bibl>
                  </note>. But to have a juſt
idea of their muſic, we muſt liſten to them in the time of hatching; it
is then, when chanting the hymn of love, that birds diſplay their true
warble.</p>
               <p>A fowler, who had travelled, aſſured me that theſe birds
are bred in Luxemburg; that they make their neſts in the moſt branchy firs
at a conſiderable height; that they begin about the end of April; that they
employ the long moſs of firs for the outſide, and hair, wool, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the lining; that the female lays four or five yellowiſh ſpotted eggs;
and that they begin to flutter from branch to branch about the end of May.</p>
               <p>The Brambling is, according to Belon, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous bird, and
defends itſelf with its bill to the laſt gaſp. All agree that it is of a
more eaſy temper than the Chaffinch, and more readily enſnared. Many of
them are killed in certain fowling-matches which are frequent in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Weiſſemburg, and which deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1084600104:131"/>
The fowlers aſſemble at the little town of Bergzabern; on the evening of
the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they diſpatch ſcouts to remark the trees on which the
Bramblings commonly paſs the night, and which are generally the pitch-pines,
and other ever-greens; the ſcouts, after their return, ſerve as guides for
the company, which ſet out in the evening with torches and
ſhooting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trunks<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sarbacanes.</hi>
                  </note>. The
birds are dazzled with the glare, and killed by pellets of dry earth
diſcharged from the trunks. They ſhoot very near, leſt they ſhould
miſs; for if a bird chanced to be wounded, its cries would ſcare away the
flock.</p>
               <p>The principal food of theſe birds, when kept in a cage, is
panic, hemp-ſeed, and beech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt. Olina ſays that they live four or five
years.</p>
               <p>Their plumage varies: in ſome males the throat is black; in
others, the head is entirely white, and the colours in general lighter<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Aldrovandus.</bibl>
                  </note>. Friſch remarks,
that the young males are not ſo black at their arrival, and that the inferior
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of their wings are not ſo vivid a yellow as at their departure.
Perhaps a more advanced age occaſions ſtill other differences between the
ſexes, and may account for the diverſity of deſcriptions.</p>
               <p>The Brambling which I obſerved weighed an ounce; its face was
black; the upper-part of its <pb n="115" facs="tcp:1084600104:132"/> head, neck, and back,
varied with yellowiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray, and gloſſy-black; the throat, the fore-part
of the neck, the breaſt, and the rump, ruſt-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured; the ſmall coverts
of the baſe of the wing, yellow-orange; the others formed two tranſverſe
rays of a yellowiſh-white, ſeparated by a broader black bar; all the quills
of the wing, except the three firſt, had on their outer edge, where the great
coverts terminate, a white ſpot, about five lines long; the ſucceſſion
of theſe ſpots formed a third white ray, which was parallel to the two
others when the wing was expanded, but when the wing was cloſed it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
only like an oblong ſpot almoſt parallel to the ſide of the quills;
laſtly, theſe quills were of an exceedingly fine black, edged with white.
The ſmall inferior coverts of the wings next the body were diſtinguiſhed
by their beautiful yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour. The quills of the tail were black, edged
with white, or whitiſh; the tail forked; the flanks ſtreaked with black;
the legs of a brown-olive; the nails ſlightly incurvated, the hind one the
ſtrongeſt of all; the edges of the upper mandible ſcalloped near the
point, the edges of the lower one fitted into the upper; and the tongue parted
at the tip into ſeveral delicate filaments.</p>
               <p>The inteſtinal tube was fourteen inches long; the gizzard was
muſcular, coated with a carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous membrane ſlightly adhering, and

               <p>The female has not the orange ſpot at the baſe of the bill,

               <p>ALL the ſpecies of Widows are inhabitants of Africa; but they
are not entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that region, for they occur in Aſia, and even
in the Philippine Iſlands. They all have a conical bill of ſufficient
ſtrength to break the ſeeds on which they feed: they all are
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a long tail, or rather by long feathers, which in moſt
of the males accompany the true tail, and are inſerted above or below its
origin: laſtly, all, or nearly all of them, are ſubject to two annual
moultings, the interval between which correſponds to the rainy ſeaſon,
and laſts ſix or eight months, during which the males loſe not only their
long tail, but their rich colour and pleaſant warble<note n="*" place="bottom">The melody of their ſong is one of the reaſons that induces
Edwards to claſs them with the Finches rather than with the Sparrows.</note>;
and it is not before the return of ſpring that they recover the attributes or
ornaments of their ſex.</p>
               <p>The females undergo the ſame moultings, but not only is the
change leſs perceptible in them, but the colours of their plumage are not
ſo much affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:1084600104:150"/> The period of the firſt moulting in the
young males muſt evidently depend on the time of their birth: thoſe of the
earlieſt hatch aſſume their long tail in May; but thoſe hatched
lateſt in the ſeaſon, do not aſſume it till September or October.</p>
               <p>Travellers aſſert that the Widows conſtruct their neſt
with cotton, and that they divide it into two ſtories<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Kolben's deſcription of the Cape of Good Hope. It
appears very probable, that the changeable-plumaged Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinches, of which he
ſpeaks, are really Widow-birds.</note>, the upper being deſtined for the
male, and the under for the female. It is poſſible to aſcertain this
circumſtance in Europe, and even in France, where by a careful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the
Widows may be made to lay and hatch, as is ſucceſsfully practiſed in
Holland.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are lively and volatile, and are conſtantly
raiſing and dropping the tail: they are very fond of bathing, not at all
ſubject to diſeaſes, and live twelve or fifteen years. They are fed with
a mixture of ſpikenard and millet; and by way of cooling, they have leaves of
ſuccory.</p>
               <p>It is ſomewhat odd that the name of Widows, by which they are
now generally known, and which ſeems to be very applicable to both, becauſe
of the black that predominates in their plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and becauſe of their train
at the tail, owed its origin to a mere miſtake. The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1084600104:151"/> called them at firſt <hi>Birds of Whidha</hi> (that
is, of Juida), becauſe they are very common on that coaſt of Africa; and
foreigners were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ſimilarity between that word and the name of
Widow in the Portugueſe tongue<note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards was led into
this miſtake, which he afterwards diſcovered.</note>.</p>
               <p>We ſhall here treat of eight ſpecies of Widows; viz. the
five already known and deſcribed by Briſſon; two new ones which are
already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by a beautiful red ſpot on the wing, and another
on the breaſt: laſtly, to theſe I ſhall add the Bird which Briſſon
calls <hi>the Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed Linnet,</hi> which, were it only for the long tail, I
ſhould rather range with the Widows than with the Linnets.</p>

                  <p>The neck of this bird is covered by a broad half-collar, of a
fine yellow gold colour; the belly and thighs are white; the abdomen and the
coverts of the under-part of the tail blackiſh; the head, throat, fore-part
of the neck, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1084600104:152"/> back, wings, and tail, black. The tail is
formed as in other birds; it conſiſts of twelve quills nearly equal, and
covered by four long feathers, which riſe alſo from the rump, but
ſomewhat higher; the two longeſt are about thirteen inches, and are black,
like thoſe of the tail, and appear waved, and as it were clouded; a little
arched like thoſe of the cock; their breadth, which is nine lines near the
rump, is reduced to three near the extremity: the ſhorteſt are incloſed
between the two longeſt, and are only half as long, but they are twice as
broad, and end in a ſlender ſilky filament, more than an inch long.</p>
                  <p>Theſe four feathers have their planes in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ſituation, and are bent downwards; they drop every year in the firſt
moulting about the beginning of November, and at this period their plumage
ſuffers a total change, and becomes like that of the Brambling. It is now
variegated on the head with white and black; the breaſt, the back, the
ſuperior coverts of the wings, dirty orange, ſprinkled with blackiſh; the
fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the tail and the wings of a very deep brown; the belly, and all
the reſt of the under-part of the body, white:—Such is its winter garb,
which it retains till the vernal ſeaſon, when it undergoes a ſecond
moulting as complete as the former, but happier in its effects, for it
reſtores the fine colours, the long feathers, and all the decorations; and
before the <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1084600104:153"/> beginning of July the bird has experienced a
total renovation. The colour of its eyes, of its bill, and of its legs, never
vary: the eyes are cheſnut; the bill lead-colour; and the legs
fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour.</p>
                  <p>The young females are nearly of the colour of the males in
moult; but at the end of three years, their plumage has become brown, almoſt
black, and changes no more.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds are common in the kingdom of Angola, on the
weſtern coaſt of Africa: ſome have alſo been ſent from Mozambique, a
ſmall iſland on the eaſtern coaſt of the ſame continent, and which
differed little from the former. The ſubject which Edwards figured lived four
years in London.</p>
                  <p>Total length fifteen inches; length meaſured from the tip of
the bill to the end of the nails four inches and a half; the bill four lines

they are attended with ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar effects. Its bill and legs are red; the head
and all the upper-part of the body black; the throat, the fore-part of the
neck, the breaſt, and all the lower-part bluſh-coloured, but which is
brighter on the neck than on the breaſt, and extending behind the neck, it
forms an half collar, which is broader the lower the black hood deſcends from
the head. All the feathers of the tail are blackiſh, but the four middle ones
are four or five times longer than thoſe of the ſide, and the two middle
ones are the longeſt of all. In moulting, the male becomes like the Linnet,
only it is of a lighter gray. The female is brown, and has not the long

upper-part of the body is variegated with theſe two colours; the rump, and

               <p>THIS bird muſt not be confounded with the Yellow Bunting
<hi>(Bruant);</hi> though in many provinces it bears the ſame name; for, not
to mention other diſtinctions, it wants the oſſeous tubercle in the
palate.</p>
               <p>The Greenfinch paſſes the winter in the woods, and
ſhelters itſelf from the inclemency of the ſeaſon in the ever-green
trees, and even in elms and branchy oaks which retain their withered
leaves.</p>
               <p>In ſpring it makes it neſt in the ſame trees, and
ſometimes in buſhes: this neſt is larger, and almoſt as neatly formed
as that of the Chaffinch; it conſiſts of dry herbs and moſs, lined with
hair, wool, and feathers: ſometimes it places it in the chinks of the
branches, which <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1084600104:169"/> it even widens with its bill; it alſo
conſtructs near the ſpot a little magazine for proviſions<note n="*" place="bottom">We owe theſe laſt facts, and ſome others, to M.

               <p>The female lays five or ſix eggs, ſpotted at the large end
with brown red on a white green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ground. She ſits aſſiduouſly, and
ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues on her eggs though a perſon approaches pretty near; ſo
that ſhe is often caught with her young: at all other times ſhe is ſhy

BELON. Guys adds, that the warble of the female is even ſuperior to that of
the male, which would be ſingular in birds.</note>. At his return to the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and at his departure, he utters a ſingular cry, conſiſting of
two ſounds. The warble is ſaid to be improved in the croſs breed between
the Greenfinch and the Canary.</p>
               <p>The Greenfinches are gentle, and eaſily tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they learn to
articulate a few words; and no bird ſo ſoon becomes expert at the little
manoeuvre of drawing up the cup<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>De la
galere,</hi> alluding to the labour of a galley-ſlave.</note>. They eat from
the ſinger of their maſter, and anſwer his call, &amp;c. In autumn they
join other ſpecies, to roam in the fields; they live upon juniper ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in
winter; they crop the buds of trees, and <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1084600104:170"/> particularly
thoſe of the bog-willow; they feed in ſummer on all ſorts of ſeeds, and
eſpecially thoſe of hemp; they alſo eat caterpillars, ants, and
graſshoppers.</p>
               <p>The name alone denotes that the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant colour of the
plumage is green; but the tinge is not pure; there is a gray-brown caſt on
the upper-part of the body and on the flanks, with an admixture of yellow on
the throat and breaſt; yellow is ſpread over the top of the belly, the
inferior coverts of the tail and wings, and on the rump; it edges the largeſt
quills of the wings, and alſo the lateral quills of the tail: all theſe are
blackiſh, and moſt of them bordered with white on the inſide; the lower
belly is alſo white, and the legs reddiſh-brown.</p>
               <p>The female has more brown; her belly is entirely white, and the
inferior coverts of her tail are mingled with white, brown, and yellow.</p>
               <p>The bill is fleſh-coloured, ſhaped like a cone, and
ſimilar to that of the Groſbeak, but ſmaller; its upper edges are
ſlightly ſcalloped near the point, and receive thoſe of the lower
mandible, which are ſomewhat <hi>re-entrant.</hi> The bird weighs rather more
than an ounce, and is nearly of the bulk of the Houſe-ſparrow.</p>
               <p>Total length five inches and a half; the bill ſix lines and a
half; the alar extent nine inches; the tail twenty-three lines, ſomewhat
forked, ſtretching beyond the wings ten or eleven lines. Theſe birds have a
gall-bladder, a muſcular <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1084600104:171"/> gizzard covered with a
looſe membrane, and a pretty large craw.</p>
               <p>Some pretend that there are Greenfinches of three different

the young Painted Buntings are brown the firſt year; in the ſecond, their

of the wings and of the tail are brown, edged with greeniſh blue.</p>
                  <p>But it is the female chiefly which reſembles the Greenfinch;
the upper-part of its body is of a dull green, and all the under-part of a

                  <p>Theſe birds breed in Carolina on the orange trees, but do
not continue there during the <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1084600104:174"/> winter. Like the Widows,
they have two moultings annually, which are earlier or later according to
circumſtances. Sometimes they aſſume their winter garb in the end of
Auguſt or the beginning of September; in this ſtate the under-part of their
body changes from red to yellowiſh. They feed like the Widow-birds, upon
millet, Canary-ſeeds, ſuccory, &amp;c. . . . but they are more delicate:
however, if they are once ſeaſoned to the climate, they will live eight or
ten years. They are found in Louiſiana.</p>
                  <p>The Hollanders have been able, by care and patience, to breed
the Painted Buntings in their country, as they have ſucceeded with the
Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals and Widows; and it is likely that with the ſame attention they might
be propagated in every part of Europe.—They are rather ſmaller than the

Goldfinches, in which all the wing-quills except the two firſt and the ſix
intermediate ones of the tail, are tipt with white: and in which are alſo the
oval ſpots on the inner-ſide of the two lateral quills of the
tail.</note>.</p>
               <p>The female has leſs red than the male, and no black at all.
The young ones do not aſſume their fine red till the ſecond year: they
are at firſt ſtained with dirty obſcure colours, and, for that reaſon,
they are called <hi>Griſets;</hi> but the yellow on the wings appears early,
and alſo the <pb n="162" facs="tcp:1084600104:185"/> white ſpots on the quills of the tail;
yet theſe ſpots are of a duller white<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſerved
before the 15th June. I have alſo remarked, that when the Goldfinches were
quite young, their bill was brown, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the point and edges, which were
whitiſh and tranſparent; which is the reverſe of their appearance when
adult.</note>.</p>
               <p>The males have a well-known and a pleaſant warble. They begin
about the 1ſt of March, and continue during the whole of the genial
ſeaſon: they chant even in the winter when kept in warm apartments, where
they enjoy the temperature of ſpring<note n="†" place="bottom">I have
two which ſang every day through the whole of this winter, kept in a cloſe
chamber, but without any fire. The greateſt cold has not indeed been under
eight degrees (fifty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Fahrenheſt).</note>. Aldrovandus ranks them the
fecond of the ſinging birds: Daines Barrington admits them only into the
ſixth place. They ſeem to have a greater facility in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſong

                        <hi>Philoſ, Tranſ.</hi> 1773.</bibl> Olina ſays, that
the young Goldfinches which hear Linnets, Canaries, &amp;c. acquire their
ſong. But I know of a young cock Goldfinch and a young hen Linnet that were
bred together; and the Goldfinch retained his native warble, while the Linnet
adopted and improved it.</note>. This has been experienced both by Salerne and
Barrington. The latter indeed ſuppoſes, that this imitation was
occaſioned by the early impreſſions made by the notes of that little
bird; but we muſt either account in the ſame way for the caſe noticed by
Salerne, or admit that there is a certain analogy between the organs of ſound
in the Goldfinch and the Wren.</p>
               <p>In England, the Goldfinches from Kent are reckoned the beſt
ſingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1084600104:186"/> Theſe birds and the Chaffinches
conſtruct the neateſt and moſt compact neſts. They conſiſt of fine
moſs, lichens, liver-wort, ruſhes, ſmall roots, and the down of
thiſtles, interwoven with great art, and lined with dry graſs, hair, wool,
and down: they generally place them in trees, and particularly on plums and
walnuts, and eommonly ſelect the weak branches which ſhake the moſt.
Sometimes they neſtle in copſes, and ſometimes in thorny buſhes; and it
is ſaid that the young Goldfinches bred in ſuch ſituations are of a
darker plumage, but more ſprightly, and ſing better than others. Olina
makes the ſame remark in regard to thoſe hatched in the month of Auguſt.
The female begins to lay about the middle of ſpring, at firſt, five eggs,
ſpotted with reddiſh brown near the large end<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon
ſays, that the Goldfinches have commonly eight young; but I have never found
more than five eggs in about thirty neſts which I have ſeen.</note>. If the
neſt be demoliſhed, ſhe makes a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or even a third hatch, but the
number of eggs diminiſhes each time. I have never found more than four eggs
in the neſts brought to me in July, nor more than two in thoſe of
September.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are much attached to their young; they feed them
with caterpillars and inſects: if both be caught together and ſhut up in
the ſame cage, the parents will ſtill continue their care. It is true, that
of four young Goldfinches which <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1084600104:187"/> I treated this way, none
lived more than a month; but I attribute this to the improper choice of food,
and not to the heroic deſpair which, it is pretended, prompts them to kill
their offspring, and thus deliver them from ſlavery<note n="*" place="bottom">Gerini, and many others. It is even added, that if the young ones
be reared in a cage by parents which are ſuffered to enjoy freedom, theſe
obſerving after ſome time the impoſſibility to reſcuing their brood
from bondage, will out of compaſſion poiſon them with a certain herb.
Such fables need no refutation.</note>.</p>
               <p>The cock Goldfinch ought to have only one female, and, that
their union may be productive, both ſhould be at liberty. It is ſomewhat
ſingular, that the cock Goldfinch, when ſhut in a volery, is not ſo much
diſpoſed to pair with his own female as with the hen Canary<note n="†" place="bottom">It is ſaid that the Goldfinches intermix with none
of a different ſpecies; and that the experiment has been made without
ſucceſs in regard to the Linnets. But I confidently affirm, that with
proper care we may obtain not only this, but many other combinations: for the
Siſkins are ſtill more eaſily reconciled to the ſociety of the Canaries
than the Goldfinches, and yet it is ſaid that, in caſe of rivalſhip, the
Goldfinches are preferred by the hen Canaries.</note>, or any other female of a
warm temperament.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the hen Goldfinch breeds with the cock Canary, but
this is unfrequent<note n="‡" place="bottom">Father Bougot let a cock and
hen Goldfinch into a volery where there was a great number of Canaries of both
ſexes. The male Canaries copulated with the hen Goldfinch, while the cock
Goldfinch had no partner: which proves the ardour of the Canaries.</note>; and
on the other hand, the hen Canary, if ſeparated from the males, will
conſort with the cock Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch<note n="*" place="bottom">This circumſtance
is eſſential; for Father Bougot aſſures me, that if the female Canaries
have a fourth or even a ſixth of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of males, they will not
aſſociate with the cock Goldfinch; and that it is only when neglected by
their own ſpecies that they join the ſtranger, in which caſe they always
make the firſt advances.</note>. <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1084600104:188"/> The female is the
firſt to feel the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of paſſion, and endeavours, by all alluring
arts, and aſſiſted by the ſtill more powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the genial
ſeaſon, to urge her languid paramour to conſummate this phyſical
adultery: and yet there muſt be no female of his own ſpecies in the volery.
The preliminaries laſt commonly ſix weeks, during which time the hen Canary
makes a complete laying of addle eggs, for which her inceſſant
ſolicitations have not procured fecundation; what in animals may be termed
luſt, is almoſt always ſubordinate to the great end of nature, the
reproduction of the ſpecies. Father Bougot, whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted with
approbation, has obſerved with attention the little manoeuvres of the
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated female Canary in ſuch ſituations: ſhe often approached the
male Goldfinch, and ſquatted like a common hen, but with more
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, to invite him to the fruition: at firſt he is deaf to her
ſolicitations, but the flame ſteals upon him by degrees<note n="†" place="bottom">I have heard it alleged that the Goldfinch was a cold bird; he may
be ſo in compariſon of the Canaries, but after he is rouſed, he appears
much animated; the male has frequently been obſerved to drop in an epileptit
fit, while he chanted rapturouſly in the height of his paſſion.</note>:
often he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the embrace, and his reſolution as often 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1084600104:189"/> fails; at each attempt he ſpreads his wings and gives
vent to feeble cries. However, after the union is accompliſhed, he proceeds
to diſcharge the duties of a parent; he aſſiſts his mate in
conſtructing the neſt<note n="*" place="bottom">They prefer moſs and dry
graſs for the materials.</note>, and carries food to her while ſhe is
engaged in hatching, or in rearing her young.</p>
               <p>Though theſe conſtrained amours will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceed
with a hen Canary and a wild Goldfinch, it is better to raiſe together
thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for breeding, and not to pair them till they are two years
old. The offspring reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles more the father in the ſhape of the bill, in
the colours of the head and of the wings, and in ſhort in all the
extremities, and the mother in the reſt of the body: they have alſo been
remarked to be ſtronger, and live longer; and to have a clearer natural
warble, but to be not ſo docile in adopting the notes of our artificial
muſic.</p>
               <p>Theſe hybrids are ſtill capable of propagating, and when
they are paired with the hen Canary, the ſecond generation has a manifeſt
analogy to the ſpecies of the Goldfinch<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Hebert.</bibl>
                  </note>; ſo much does the male influence
predominate in the act of generation.</p>
               <p>The Goldfinch flies low, but with an even continued motion, like
the Linnet; and not by jerks and bounds, like the Sparrow. It is an 
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1084600104:190"/> active and laborious bird; if not employed in pecking
the heads of poppies, of hemp, or of thiſtles, it is conſtantly buſy in
carrying back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards whatever it can find in its cage. One
ſolitary male of this ſpecies is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to diſturb a whole volery
of Canaries; it teazes the females while they are ſitting, fights with their
males, tears away the neſts, and breaks the eggs. We ſhould hardly conceive
that birds ſo lively and petulant could be ſo gentle and even ſo docile.
They live in harmony with each other, ſeek each other's ſociety, give marks
of regard at all ſeaſons, and ſeldom quarrel but about their food. They
are not ſo peaceful with other birds; they beat the Canaries and Linnets,
but, in their turn, they receive the ſame treatment from the Titmouſe. They
have a ſingular inſtinct of always chuſing to ſleep in the higheſt
part of the volery; and we may naturally ſuppoſe a ground of quarrel will
be afforded, when the other birds will not give place to them.</p>
               <p>The docility of the Goldfinches is well known: they can be
inſtructed without much trouble to perform ſeveral movements with accuracy,
to fire a cracker, and to draw up ſmall cups con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their food and
drink; but for this laſt purpoſe they muſt be <hi>clothed.</hi> This
clothing conſiſts of a ſmall belt of ſoft leather two lines broad, with
four holes through which the feet and wings are paſſed, and the ends
joining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1084600104:191"/> the belly, are held by a ring which
ſupports the chain of the cup. In ſolitude it delights to view its image in
the mirror, fancying it ſees another of its own ſpecies; and this
attachment to ſociety ſeems to equal the cravings of nature; for often it
is obſerved to pick up the hemp ſeed, grain by grain, and advance to eat at
the mirror, imagining, no doubt, that it feeds in company.</p>
               <p>To ſucceed in breeding Goldfinches, they ought to be
ſeparated and raiſed ſingly, or at leaſt each with the female with
which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be paired.</p>
               <p>The younger Madame Daubenton educated a whole hatch; the young
Goldfinches became tame at a certain age, and afterwards relapſed into the
ſame ſavage ſtate in which they would be found if bred by their parents
in the field: they renounce the refinements of man to enjoy the ſociety of
their fellows.—But this is not the only inconvenience of training them
together; they acquire an affection for each other, and when ſeparated, to
pair with a female Canary, they are languid in their amours, are affected by
the tender remembrance of former friendships, and commonly die of
melancholy<note n="*" place="bottom">Of five Goldfinches bred in the volery of
this lady, and paired with hen Canaries, three remained inactive: the other two
copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but broke the eggs, and died ſoon afterwards.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1084600104:192"/> The Goldfinches begin to aſſemble in
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, and during that ſeaſon they are caught among the birds of
paſſage which pillage our gardens. Their natural vivacity precipitates them
into the ſnares; but, to ſucceed well, it is neceſſary to have a male
that has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſing. They are not caught by calls; and they
elude the bird of prey by taking ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among the buſhes. In winter they
fly in numerous flocks, ſo that ſeven or eight may be killed at a ſhot;
they approach the highways near which are thiſtles and wild ſuccory; they
ſhake off the ſnow to obtain the ſeeds and the caterpillars. In Provence
they lodge in great numbers among the almond-trees; when the cold is intenſe
they ſeek the cover of thick buſhes, and always near their proper food.
Thoſe kept in the cage are commonly fed with hemp-ſeed<note n="*" place="bottom">Though it is true in general that the granivorous birds live upon
ſeeds, they alſo eat caterpillars, ſmall grubs and inſects, and even
feed their young with the laſt; they alſo devour with great avidity ſmall

rape-ſeed to every other aliment.</note>. They live to a great age; Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſaw one at Mayence which was twenty-three years old; they were obliged once
a-week to ſcrape its nails and bill, that it might drink, eat, and ſit upon
its bar; its common food was poppy-ſeeds; its feathers were all turned white;
it could not fly, but remained in whatever ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was placed. In the

Goldfinches at Beaune, of which I have obtained ſome infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. They are
two males, the one four years old, and the other of a greater age; each has
undergone three moultings, and has as often recovered its beautiful colours: at
the fourth moulting both have become of a pure gloſſy black; they have
retained this colour about eight months, but it appears not more conſtant
than the firſt, for now (March the twenty-fifth) they begin to perceive gray
on the belly of one of theſe birds, red on the head, rufous on the back,
yellow on the quills of the wings, and white at their tips and on the bill. It

different from the Common Goldfinch, that he regarded it as of another
ſpecies belonging to the ſame genus; it was as large as the Chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch; its
eyes were proportionally larger; the upper-part of its body was blackiſh, the
head of <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1084600104:199"/> the ſame colour, except that the anterior part
near the bill was encircled by a ring of vivid orange; the breaſt, and the

wing-quills the ſame, with a bar of faint yellow, and not of a fine lemon, as

in general that, as in the mule qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds, they reſemble the father moſt

the under-part of the body, and the quills of the tail, yellow, the laſt tipt
with white. I have ſeen ſome whoſe head and neck were orange; it ſeemed

                  <p>All thoſe who have mentioned this bird give it the
appellation of American Goldfinch; yet this term would not be proper till it
was aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that no other Goldfinch exiſted in the 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1084600104:203"/> New World, and this ſuppoſition is not only
improbable, but abſolutely falſe, for that of the preceding article is a
native of Brazil; I have therefore adopted another denomination, which
characterizes its plumage. The bill is nearly of the ſame ſhape and colour
as the Common Goldfinch; the forehead black, which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the male;
the reſt of the head, the neck, the back, and the breaſt, ſhining yellow;
the thighs, the lower belly, the ſuperior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior coverts of the tail,
yellowiſh-white; the ſmall coverts of the wings yellow on the outſide,
whitiſh on the inſide, and tipt with white; the great coverts black, and
terminated with white ſlightly ſhaded with brown, which form two
tranſverſe rays that are very apparent on the black wings; the middle
quills of theſe are tipt with white; thoſe contiguous to the back and their
coverts are edged with yellow; the quills of the tail amount to twelve, are of
equal lengths, black above, and equal below; the lateral ones white on the
inſide near the tip; the bill and legs fleſh-coloured.</p>
                  <p>In the female the forehead is not black, but of an
olive-green, and all the upper-part of the body is of the ſame colour; the
yellow of the rump, and of the under-part of the body, is leſs brilliant; the
black on the wings more dilute, and on the contrary the tranſverſe rays are
not ſo faint; laſtly, the belly, and the inferior co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of the tail, are
entirely white.</p>

from the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male by nothing but its black forehead.</p>
                  <p>The female obſerved by Edwards was ſhut up alone in a
cage, and yet layed in the month of Auguſt 1755, a ſmall egg of pearl-gray,
and without ſpots; but, what is more uncommon, Edwards adds, that it moulted
regularly twice a-year, in March and September. In winter the body was entirely
brown; but the head, wings, and tail, retained that colour only in ſummer.
The male died too ſoon for this obſervation; but probably, like the female,
it would have dropt its feathers twice annually, and in that reſpect
reſemble the Bengals, the Widow-birds, and many other natives of warm
climates.</p>
                  <p>In the ſubject obſerved by Briſſon, the belly, the
loins, the inferior coverts of the tail, and of the wings, were of the ſame
yellow with the reſt of the body; the ſuperior coverts of the tail
white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray; the bill, the legs, and the nails, white: but moſt of theſe
differences may be owing to the different ſtates in which the bird has been
examined. Edwards drew it from the life, and his ſpecimen appears beſides
to have been larger than that of Briſſon.</p>
                  <p>Cateſby tells us that it is very rare in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, more
frequent in Virginia, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in New York. The one figured in the

               <p>BRISSON calls this bird the Little Vine Linnet: but it appears
to reſemble the Siſkin, and its ſong is much inferior to that of the
Linnet. Geſner tells us, that at Nuremberg it has the name of
<hi>Tſchiit-Scherle,</hi> on account of its ſharp cry; he adds, that it
appears only once in five or ſeven years<note n="†" place="bottom">Whatever is uncommon turns into the marvellous. Some ſay that
the appearance of numerous flocks of the Leſſer Redpolls forebodes a
plague; others, that they are rats metamorphoſed into birds before the

accounted for their not being found in ſummer.

and departs in February.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid that it bears more analogy to the Siſkin than to
the Linnet; this was the opinion of Geſner, and it is alſo that of Dr.
Lottinger, who is well acquainted with theſe little birds. Friſch goes
farther, for he aſſerts that the Siſkin will ſerve for a call to allure
the Leſſer Redpolls into ſnares in the time of paſſage, and that the
two ſpecies intermix and propagate with each other. Aldrovandus perceived a
ſtrong likeneſs between the Leſſer Redpoll and the Goldfinch, which,
except its red head, reſembles much a Siſkin. A bird-catcher of great
experience and little reading, told me that he has caught many of the
Leſſer Redpolls intermixed with Siſkins, which they were very like,
eſpecially the females, only their plumage was darker, and their bill
ſhorter. Laſtly, Linnaeus ſays, that the Leſſer Redpolls fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
places covered with alders, and Schwenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld reckons the ſeeds of theſe
trees among the aliments which they prefer; but the Siſkins are extremely
fond of theſe ſeeds. The Leſſer <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1084600104:208"/> Redpolls eat not
rape ſeed like the Linnet, but hemp ſeed, the ſeed of ſpeckled nettles,
of thiſtles, of flax, of poppies, and crop the buds of young branches of oak,
&amp;c.: they mix readily with other birds: they are particularly tame in
winter, and will then allow us to approach very near them without being

and can eaſily be caught with lime-twigs.</p>
               <p>The Leſſer Redpoll frequents the woods, and often lodges in
the oaks: it creeps along the trunk like the Titmouſe, and alſo clings to
the extremity of the ſmall branches. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably is derived the name of

               <p>The Leſſer Redpolls grow very fat, and are excellent eating.
Schwenckfeld ſays, that they have a craw like the poultry, diſtinct from
the ſmall ſac formed by the dilatation of the <hi>oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> before

complete border of a more delicate colour; the bill yellowiſh, but brown near
the tip; the legs brown. Thoſe obſerved by Schwenckfeld had cinereous

               <p>OF all the granivorous birds, the Goldfinch is reckoned the
moſt a-kin to the Siſkin; both have the bill elongated and ſlender near
the point; both are gentle, docile, and lively. The fruits of their
intermixture are alſo fit to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.—Some naturaliſts have been
induced by theſe analogies, to regard them as two contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpecies
belonging to the ſame genus: indeed all the granivorous birds may be
claſſed together; for their croſs-breed are prolific. Since this general
character extends to them all, it becomes the more neceſſary to ſelect
the diſtinguiſhing features, and to trace the preciſe boundaries of each
ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The Siſkin is ſmaller than the Goldfinch; its bill is
proportionally ſhorter, and its plumage is <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1084600104:212"/> entirely
different: its head is not red, but black; its throat brown; the fore-part of
its neck, its breaſt, and the lateral quills of its tail, yellow; the belly
yellowiſh white; the under-part of the body olive-green, ſpeckled with
black, which aſſumes a yellow caſt on the rump, and ſtill more yellow
on the ſuperior coverts of the tail.</p>
               <p>But in the more intimate qualities, which reſult directly from
organization or inſtinct, the differences are ſtill greater. The Siſkin
has a ſong peculiar to itſelf, and much inferior to that of the Goldfinch;
it is very fond of alder-ſeeds, which the Goldfinch will never touch, and the
Siſkin, in its turn, is indifferent about thiſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds: it creeps along
the branches, and ſuſpends itſelf from their extremity like the
Titmouſe:—In ſhort, we might regard it as an intermediate ſpecies
to the Titmouſe and Goldfinch. Beſides, it is a bird of paſſage, and in
its migrations it flies at a great height, and is heard before it can be
ſeen; whereas the Goldfinch continues with us the whole year, and never flies
very high: laſtly, theſe two birds are never obſerved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
together.</p>
               <p>The Siſkin can be taught like the Goldfinch, to draw up the
little bucket: it is equally docile, and though not ſo active, it is more
cheerful; for it begins always the earlieſt in the morning to warble, and to
rouze the other birds. But, as it has an unſuſpicious temper, it is
eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyed into all ſorts of ſnares, traps, ſprings, &amp;c. 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1084600104:213"/> and it is more eaſily trained than any other bird
caught in the adult ſtate. We need only to offer it habitually the proper
ſort of food in the hand, and it will ſoon become as tame as the moſt
familiar Canary. We may even accuſtom it to perch upon the hand at the
ſound of a bell; for if at firſt we ring at each meal, the ſubtle
aſſociation of perceptions, which obtains alſo among the animals, will
afterwards rouze it to the call. Though the Siſkin appears to ſelect its
food with care, it conſumes much; but its voracious appetite is ſubordinate
to a noble paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: it has always in the volery ſome favourite of its
own ſpecies, or if that is not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, a bird of another ſpecies,
which it che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and feeds with the fondneſs of a parent.—It
drinks often<note n="*" place="bottom">The bird-catchers lay lime-twigs at the
ſides of brooks, and are very ſucceſsful in the capture.</note>, but
ſeldom bathes; it only approaches the margin of the water and dips its bill
and breaſt, without much fluttering, except perhaps in hot weather.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that it breeds on the iſlands in the Rhine, in
Franche-comté, in Switzerland, Greece, and Hungary, and that it prefers
the mountain foreſts. Its neſt is very difficult to diſcover<note n="†" place="bottom"> 
                     <p> 
                        <q rend="inline">"The bird-catchers in Orleans, ſays
Salerne, agree that the diſcovery of a Siſkin's neſt is a thing quite
unheard of. It is probable, however, that ſome continue in the country, and
breed near the banks of the Loiret, among the alders, of which they are very
fond; and the more ſo as young ones are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caught with limed twigs
or in traps. M. Colombeau aſſures me, that he found a neſt with five eggs
in the bleachfield of M. Hery de la Salle."</q> Kramer tells us, that in the
foreſts ſkirted by the Danube, thouſands of young Siſkins are found,
which have not dropt their firſt feathers, and yet it is very rare to meet
with a neſt. One day when he was botanizing with one of his friends about the
15th of June, they both ſaw a male and female Siſkin often fly towards an
alder with food in their bills; but, though they ſearched with all
poſſible care, they could neither hear nor ſee the young
ones.</p>
                  </note>, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:1084600104:214"/> which has given riſe to a vulgar
opinion, that the Siſkin renders it inviſible with a certain ſtone.
Accordingly, our accounts are imperfect in regard to that ſubject: Friſch
ſays that it conceals its neſt in holes; Kramer ſuppoſes the bird
covers it with leaves, which is the reaſon that it is never found.—The
beſt way to aſcertain the point, would be to obſerve how they proceed
when they breed in a volery; which, though the trial has not hitherto
ſucceeded, is ſtill poſſible.</p>
               <p>But it is more common to croſs them with the Canaries. There
ſeems to be a great ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy between the two ſpecies; they ſhew a
reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal fondneſs at the very firſt meeting, and intermix
indiſcriminately<note n="*" place="bottom">Father Bougot, from whom I received
theſe remarks, has for five years ſeen a hen Canary breed thrice annually
with the ſame cock Canary, and the four following years twice annually with
another Canary, the firſt having died.</note>. When a Siſkin is paired with
a hen Canary, he eagerly ſhares her toils; he is buſy in carying materials
for the neſt, and arranging them; and regularly diſgorges food for the
ſitting female. But yet moſt of the eggs are addle: for the union of hearts
is not alone ſufficient in generation, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1084600104:215"/> of the Siſkin wants much of the warmth of the
Canary.—The Hybrids reſemble both parents.</p>
               <p>In Germany, the Siſkins begin to migrate in October, or even
earlier; at this time they eat the hop ſeeds, to the great injury of the
proprietors, and the places where they halt are ſtrewed with leaves. They
entirely diſappear in December, and return in February<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>IN the warm parts of America is found a very numerous genus of
birds, ſome of which are called <hi>Tangaras</hi> at Brazil; and
nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have adopted this name for all the ſpecies included. Theſe
birds have been ſuppoſed by moſt travellers to be a kind of Sparrows; in
fact, they differ from the European Sparrows only by their colours, and by a
minute character, that the upper mandible is ſcolloped on both ſides near
the point. They cloſely reſemble the Sparrows in their inſtinctive
habits: they fly low and by jerks; their notes are for the moſt part harſh;
they may be alſo reckoned granivorous, for they live upon very ſmall
fruits; they are ſocial with each other, and, like the Sparrows, are ſo
familiar as to viſit the dwellings: they ſettle in dry grounds, and never
in marſhes; they lay two eggs, and ſometimes, though rarely, three.</p>
               <p>The Sparrows of Cayenne have ſeldom more eggs, while thoſe
of Europe have five or ſix; and this difference is perceived in general
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween birds of hot and thoſe of temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. The ſmalneſs of
the hatch is compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1084600104:225"/> by its frequent repetition,
love being che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and maintained by the continual and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
warmth.</p>
               <p>The whole genus of Tanagres, of which we know more than thirty
ſpecies, excluſive of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, ſeems confined to the new continent;
for all thoſe which we have received were brought from Guiana and other
countries of America, and not from Africa or India. This multitude of ſpecies
is not ſurpriſing; for, in general, the number of birds in the torrid zone
is perhaps ten times greater than in other regions, becauſe nature is there
more prolific, and leſs diſturbed in her operations by the interference of
man; becauſe foreſts are there more frequent, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence is more
plentiful, and the colds of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are unknown; and the natives of the
tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical countries, rioting in a perpetual abundance, are totally exempted
from the riſks and dangers of a migration, and ſeldom are obliged even to
ſhift from one haunt to another.</p>
               <p>To avoid confuſion, we ſhall range the thirty ſpecies of
Tanagres into three diviſions, adopting the characters from the moſt
obvious difference, that of ſize.</p>

                  <p>It meaſures from the end of the bill to that of the tail
eight inches; its bill is blackiſh, and <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1084600104:229"/> eight or nine
lines in length; its tail, which is not taper, is three inches long, and

                  <p>In the female the head is of a ſhining black, like

Fourthly, and laſtly, The Brazilian Black-bird of Belon, which received that
name from thoſe who firſt imported it into France. Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus has copied
Belon. The deſcriptions coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in every reſpect, except in the ſongs
of theſe birds; and I obſerved that thoſe which chanted were larger, had
a brighter red tinge on the plumage, and alſo on the ſuperior coverts of
the wings, &amp;c. which makes it very probable that they were the males;
indeed in almoſt all kinds of birds it is the males that are muſical.</p>
                  <p>It would alſo appear, that in the male the feathers on the
head are longer, and form a ſort of creſt, as Edwards has figured it. This
has led ſome travellers to ſay that there are two kinds of Cardinals in
Mexico; one creſted, which ſings agreeably, and the other ſmaller, which
ſings not at all.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds belong to the warm climates of Mexico, Peru, and
Brazil; but are rare in Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana. Belon tells us that in his time the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
who traded to Brazil drew conſiderable <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1084600104:231"/> profit from the
importation of them. Probably the feathers were employed to ornament the robes
and other dreſſes then in faſhion, and theſe birds were more numerous
than at preſent.</p>
                  <p>We may preſume that when travellers talk of the warble of
the Cardinal, they mean the Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Tanagre; for the <hi>Creſted
Cardinal</hi> is of the genus of the Groſbeaks, and conſequently a ſilent
bird. With regard to this point Salerne contradicts himſelf in the ſame
page. It is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admitted that this Tanagre has an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able warble,
and is ſuſceptible even of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fernandez relates that it is
found parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly at Totonocapa in Mexico, and ſings delightfully.</p>
                  <p>We reckon the following varieties of this
ſpecies:—</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Spotted Cardinal</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cardinalis Naevius,</hi> Briſſ.</note>, mentioned by
Briſſon, which differs from the Scarlet Tanagre only becauſe ſome
feathers of its back and breaſt are edged with green, which forms ſpots of
the ſame colour, and of a creſcent ſhape. Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus calls this <hi>The
Short-tailed Blackbird.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Collared Cardinal</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Cardinalis Torquatus,</hi> Briſſ.</note>, mentioned by
Briſſon. It has not only the ſame ſize and colours as the Scarlet
Tanagre, but the ſmall coverts, and the edges of the quills of the wings are
blue, and on each ſide of the neck are two great ſpots of the ſame
colour, they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:1084600104:232"/> and ſhaped like a
creſcent. But Briſſon copies his deſcriptions of the Collared and
Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Cardinal from Aldrovandus, who ſaw only the figures of theſe two
birds, which renders their very exiſtence doubtful. Indeed I ſhould not
have taken notice of them, did not the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menclators inſert them in their
catalogues.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Mexican bird which Hernan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez calls <hi>The
Parrot-coloured Mexican bird,</hi> and which Briſſon deſcribes under the
name of <hi>Mexican Cardinal.</hi> Hernandez ſays only, 
<q rend="inline">"This bird, from the lower part of the bill
(which is ſomewhat hooked, and entirely cinereous) as far as the tail,
including the whole of the belly, is of a minium tinge. The ſame colour is
ſpread over the rump, and part of the back; but near the wings it receives a
greeniſh tinge that gradually increaſes from thence to the neck, which is
quite green. The head has an amethyſtine or hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthine tinge. The circle
which ſurrounds the pupil is very white, and the orbits of a deep coerulean.
The origin of the wings is yellowiſh; their quills hyacinthine, and marked
with a greeniſh ſtreak. The tail is entirely amethyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, without any
mixture of green, and more dilute near the end. The legs, which have three toes
before, and one behind, are of a cinereous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violet."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe birds fly in flocks, and are eaſily caught with

                  <p>This bird differs from the Scarlet Tanagre by its ſize and
plumage; it is ſmaller, and of a light flame-colour; its bill is entirely of
a lead-colour, and has none of the peculiar characters; while in the Scarlet
Tanagre, the upper-part of the bill is of a deep black, and the point of the
lower mandible black, the reſt of it white, and bellied tranſverſely.</p>
                  <p>The Scarlet Tanagre is only found in the warmer parts of South

Sonini de Manoncour. Its plumage is of an uniform cinereous; ſomewhat lighter
under the belly, except the fore-part and the back of the head, of the throat,
and of the top of the breaſt, which are ſpread with black. The wings and
the tail are alſo cinereous, but deeper <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1084600104:236"/> caſt than

                  <p>The French ſettlers in Cayenne have given this bird the name
of <hi>Silver-Bill (Bec-d' Argent),</hi> which expreſſes a remarkable
ſpecific character; viz. that the baſe of the lower mandible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends under
the eyes, and forms on each ſide a thick plate, which, when the bird is
alive, looks like the brighteſt ſilver; but this luſtre tarniſhes after
death. It is imperfectly repreſented in the <hi>Planches
Enluminées.</hi> Edwards has given an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent figure of this bird
under the name of <hi>Red-breaſted Black-bird;</hi> he is deceived indeed in
regard to the genus, but he has hit the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating features.</p>
                  <p>The total length is ſix inches and a half, and that of the
bill nine lines, which is black on the <pb n="216" facs="tcp:1084600104:240"/> upper-part; the
head, throat, and breaſt, are purple, and the reſt of the body black, with
ſome purple tints. The iris is brown. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male differs from the male, not
only in the colour of its bill, but in thoſe of its plumage; the upper-part
of its body is brown, with ſome ſhades of obſcure purple, and the
under-part reddiſh; the tail and wings are brown.</p>
                  <p>Another diſcriminating character of the male, is a ſort of
half collar round the occiput, formed by long purple briſtles, which project
near three lines beyond the feathers. We are indebted to Sonini for this
remark; and alſo for our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with this and all the other Tanagres
of Guiana.</p>
                  <p>This bird is more numerous than any of the Tanagres in the
Iſland of Cayenne and in Guiana; and it probably occurs in many other warm
countries of America, for Fernandez gives the ſame account of a Mexican bird
that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents the vicinity of the mountains of Tepuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullula. It feeds upon
ſmall fruits, and alſo upon the large pulpy produce of the bananas, &amp;c.
when they are ripe; but eats no inſects. It haunts the cleareſt ſpots,
and does not ſhun the neighbourhood of dwellings, and even viſits the
gardens. However, the Red-breaſted Tana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres are alſo very common in
deſert tracts, and even in the glades of the foreſts; for in ſpots where
the trees are levelled by the hurricanes, and where the ſun darts his burning
rays, there <pb n="217" facs="tcp:1084600104:241"/> are generally ſome of theſe birds,
though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in pairs, and never in flocks.</p>
                  <p>Their neſt is cylindrical, and ſomewhat curved, which they
faſten horizontally between the branches, the entrance being below; ſo that
the rain, from whatever direction it beats, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not penetrate. It is ſix
inches long, and four inches and a half in diameter; it is conſtructed with
ſtraws and the dry leaves of the Indian flowering reed<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Canna Indica,</hi> Linn.</note>, and the bottom is well lined
with broader portions of the ſame leaves:—it is generally fixed in the
loftieſt trees. The female lays two elliptical eggs, which are white, and
covered at the thick end with ſmall ſpots of light red, which melts away as
it approaches the other end.</p>
                  <p>Some nomenclators have given this bird the name of Cardinal,
but improperly: others have ſuppoſed that there is an obvious variety in
this ſpecies. In Mauduit's cabinet we ſaw a bird whoſe plumage is pale
roſe-colour, variegated with gray; I am rather inclined to think, that this
difference is occaſioned by moulting.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific

familiar as the name ſeems to import. Perhaps it owes the appellation to this
circumſtance:—the Creſted Fly-catcher in Saint Domingo, and the
Forked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail Fly-catcher of Canada, are termed <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and are much
larger and ſtronger than this bird, which alſo feeds on inſects.</p>
                  <p>The Saint Domingo Tanagre bears ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the
Thruſhes; the colours, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the ſpeckles on the breaſt, are
ſimilar in both, and, like the reſt of its genus, it has the upper mandible
ſcalloped.</p>
                  <p>The head, the upper-part of the neck, the back, the rump, the
ſcapular feathers, and the ſuperior coverts of the wings, are of an uniform
colour; all the under-part of the body is of a dirty white, varied with brown
ſpots, that occupy the middle of each feather; the wing-quills are brown,
edged exteriorly with olive, and interiorly with dirty-white; the two middle
quills of the tail are brown, the reſt of <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1084600104:244"/> the ſame

                  <p>Brought from Cayenne by Sonini. The plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage conſiſts of
three colours; red, green, and blue, which are all very bright. The two birds
repreſented in N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 33 of the <hi>Planches Enlumineés,</hi> ſeem to
belong to the ſame ſpecies, and perhaps differ only in ſex; for in the

                  <p>The plumage is variegated with ſeven co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: fine green on
the head, and the ſmall ſuperior coverts of the wings; gloſſy black on
the upper-parts of the neck and back, on the middle quills of the wings, and on
the upper <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1084600104:254"/> ſurface of the quills of the tail; brilliant
fire-colour on the back; orange-yellow on the rump; violet-blue on the throat,
the lower-part of the neck, and the great ſuperior coverts of the wings; deep
gray on the under-ſurface of the tail; and, laſtly, fine ſea-green on all
the under-part of the body from the breaſt. Theſe colours are all
exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bright, and well defined.</p>
                  <p>It does not aſſume the vivid red on the back till grown
up, and the female never has that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the lower-part of her back too is
orange like the rump, and in general her tints are more dilute, and not ſo
diſtinctly deſined as thoſe of the male—But there is ſtill ſome
diverſity in the diſpoſition of the colours; ſome males have the bright
red on the rump as well as on the back; and in many others both the back and
rump are entirely of a gold colour.</p>
                  <p>The male and female are nearly of the ſame ſize, being
five inches long; the bill only ſix lines, and the legs eight lines; the tail
is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what forked, and the wings reach to the middle of it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds appear in numerous flocks. They feed upon the
tender half-formed fruits which grow on a certain large tree in Guiana. They
arrive in the iſland of Cayenne when this tree is in bloſſom, and depart
ſoon afterwards, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating probably into the interior parts of the country
when the ſame fruits are later in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to maturity. They make their
appearance in <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1084600104:255"/> the inhabited parts of Guiana commonly
about the middle of September, and ſtay about ſix weeks; they return again
in April or May. Indeed they ſeem to ſeek always the ſame food; and when
any of thoſe trees is in blow, we may certainly expect to find a number of
theſe birds.</p>
                  <p>They breed not during their reſidence in Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana. Marcgrave
tells us that in Brazil they are kept in the cage, and fed on meal and bread.
They have no warble, and their cry is ſhort and ſharp.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not with Briſſon range the <hi>Talao</hi> with
this ſpecies; for the deſcription given by Seba is not at all applicable to
it: 
<q rend="inline">"The Talao," ſays Seba, "has its plumage
beautifully varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with pale green, with black, with yellow, and with
white; the feathers of the head and breaſt are finely ſhaded with pale
green, and with black; and the bill, the legs, and the toes, are deep
black."</q> Beſides, what demonſtratively proves it to be not the ſame
bird, the author adds, that it is very rare in Mexico; whereas the Paradiſe
Tanagres we have ſeen arrive there in very great numbers.</p>

white, ſlightly varied with cinereous; the upper-part of the head is
gloſſy black, which extends on each ſide of the neck in a black bar,
diſtinctly marked on the white ground of the throat, which makes the bird

                  <p>Such is the name this little bird receives at St. Domingo;
becauſe it ſounds all the notes of the octave, riſing from the baſe to
the treble. This ſort of ſong, which implies that the ear of this bird is
organized ſimilarly to the human ear, is not only ſingular, but very
pleaſant. The Chevalier Fabre Deſhayes has informed me in a letter, that in
the ſouth of St. Domingo on the high mountains, there is a ſmall bird very
rare and famous, called the <hi>Muſician,</hi> whoſe ſong can be written.
We preſume that this is the ſame with the <hi>Organiſt.</hi> But ſtill
we ſhould doubt of the regular ſucceſſion of muſical ſounds; for we
had not the bird alive. It was preſented by the Count de Noë, who had
brought it from the Spaniſh diſtrict of St. Domingo, where he told me it
was very rare, and difficult to diſcover, or to ſhoot; becauſe it is
ſhy, and artfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals itſelf; it even turns round the branch as the
hunter changes place, to elude his view: ſo that though there be ſeveral of
theſe birds on a tree, it often happens that not one of them can be
perceived.</p>
                  <p>The length four inches; the plumage blue on the head and neck;
the back, the wings, and the tail, are ſtained with black, running 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1084600104:262"/> into coarſe blue; the forehead, the rump, and all the
upper-part of the body, coloured with orange-colour.—This ſhort
deſcription is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſcriminate it.</p>
                  <p>We find in Dupratz's Hiſtory of Louiſiana, the
deſcription of a ſmall bird which he calls <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and which we
believe to be the ſame with the <hi>Organiſt.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"The Biſhop is a bird ſmaller than the
Canary; its plumage is blue, verging on violet.—It feeds on many ſorts
of ſmall ſeeds, among theſe <hi>widlogouil</hi> and
<hi>choupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choul,</hi> a kind of millet peculiar to the country. Its notes are
ſo flexible, its warble ſo tender, that when we once hear it, we become
more reſerved in our eulogiums on this nightingale. Its ſong laſts during
a <hi>Miſerere,</hi> and during the whole time it never makes an
inſpiration; it reſts twice as long before it renews its muſic, the whole
interval elapſed being about two hours."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Dupratz does not mention whether it gives the notes of
the octaves as the Organiſt is ſaid to do, we cannot doubt their identity;
for the colours and ſize are the ſame in both. The Scarlet Tanagre, which
reſembles it in point of ſong, is twice as large; and the Arada, which has
alſo a charming warble, is entirely brown. The Organiſt is then the only
bird to which it can be referred.</p>

from the branch on which it has perched a foot, or a foot and a half
vertically, and falls back to the ſame ſpot; and thus continues to riſe
and ſink alternately, till it removes to another buſh, where it repeats the
ſame exerciſe. Each leap is attended with a ſeeble cry, expreſſive of
pleaſure, and by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of the tail. This would ſeem to be the
mode in which the male courts the female; which on the contrary remains at
eaſe, or hops about like other birds. The neſt is compoſed of dry herbs
of a gray colour; it is hemiſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and two inches in diameter; the
female depoſits in it two elliptical eggs, ſeven or eight lines long, and
of a greeniſh white, ſprinkled <pb n="238" facs="tcp:1084600104:264"/> with ſmall red

and ſhining like poliſhed ſteel, and uniform over the whole body, except
only in the male the interior coverts of the wings, which are whitiſh; for
the female is entirely gray, and differs ſo much in plumage that it might be

                  <p>It is called <hi>Teité</hi> in its native region of
Brazil. The female differs widely from the male; for the upper-part of the body
is olive-green; the forehead, and the under-part of the bill, tinged partly
with yellow, and partly with olive-yellow: whereas in the male the body is of a
deep blue; and the forehead, the under-part of the throat and belly, fine
yellow.</p>
                  <p>In the young bird the colours are ſomewhat different. The
upper-part of the body is olive, <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1084600104:265"/> ſprinkled with ſome
feathers of a deep blue; and on the front the yellow is not diſtinctly
marked. The feathers are only gray, with a little yellow at the tips; the
under-ſide of the body is of as fine a yellow in the young bird as in the
adult.</p>
                  <p>The ſame changes of plumage are obſerved in this as in the
preceding ſpecies. The neſt is alſo very like that of the Jacarini, only
it is not of ſo cloſe a texture, and is compoſed of reddiſh herbs
inſtead of gray. There is a variety of it, which, as well as the ſpecies,
is called <hi>Little Louis</hi> by the Creoles of Cayenne. They are both very
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Guiana, Surinam, and Brazil; they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the ground cleared near
the farm-houſe, and feed on the ſmall fruits which they find on the
buſhes; they light in great numbers among rice-crops, which muſt be guarded
againſt their viſits.</p>
                  <p>They may be bred in the cage, where they are pleaſant, if
five or ſix be put together. They whiſtle like the Bullfinch, and are fed
on the plants called in Brazil <hi>Paco</hi> and <hi>Mamao.</hi>

decorated with a white creſt; the neck is of a light red, and the breaſt of

that it inhabits the mountains of <hi>Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zocano</hi> in Brazil.</p>

               <p>It cannot be denied that the delicacy of their fleſh, or
rather of their fat, has contributed more to their celebrity, than the charms
of their warble. However, when kept in the cage, they have a ſong like that
of the Yellow Bunting, which, as I have already obſerved, they repeat night
and day. In countries where they are numerous, and conſequently well known,
as in Lombardy, they are not only fattened for the table, but trained to
ſing; and Salerne obſerves that there is a ſweetneſs in their notes. In
this caſe they are better treated, and not being ſuffered to grow
corpulent, their lives are prolonged. If they are kept a conſiderable time
beſide other birds, they adopt ſomething of their ſong, eſpecially when
they are young; but I know not whether they ever learn to articulate words, or
catch the notes of our muſic.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds make their appearance at the ſame time with our
Swallow, or a little after, and they <pb n="248" facs="tcp:1084600104:275"/> either accompany or
precede the Quails. They enter Lower Provence, and advance as far as Burgundy,
eſpecially in the warm diſtricts, which are planted with vineyards;
however, they touch not the grapes, but eat the inſects that prey upon the
leaves and tendrils of the vines. On their arrival, they are rather lean,
becauſe then is the ſeaſon of their loves<note n="*" place="bottom">They
may however be fatted at this time, by feeding them firſt with oats, then
with hemp-ſeed, with millet, &amp;c.</note>. They build in the vines, and
their neſts are pretty regular, and ſimilar to thoſe of the lark: they
lay four or five grayiſh eggs, and have commonly two hatches in the year. In
other countries, as in Lorraine, they place their neſts on the ground, and
prefer the corn-fields.</p>
               <p>The young family begins to direct its courſe to the ſouthern
provinces as early as the firſt of Auguſt; but the parents do not commence
their journey before the end of September. They remove into Fores, and halt in
the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of St. Chaumont and St. Etienne; they alight among the oats,
of which they are very fond, and remain till the cold weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſet
in; during which time they become ſo fat and inactive, that they might be
knocked down with ſticks. At this time they are proper for the table,
eſpecially the young ones; but they are more difficult to preſerve than
thoſe which are caught in their firſt entrance. In Bearn alſo, the
Ortolans appear twice annually; paſſing in May, and repaſſing in
October.</p>

be natives of Italy, whence they ſpread into Germany and other countries; and
this is not improbable: for though they breed at preſent in Germany, they are
caught promiſcuouſly with the Buntings and Chaffinches<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.—Kramer ranks them among the birds which occur in
Lower Auſtria; and he adds, that they live in the fields, and perch upon the
trees which grow in the midſt of meadows.</note>; but Italy has been
cultivated from a more remote antiquity. Beſides, it is not uncommon for
theſe birds, when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a ſuitable country, to adopt it and
ſettle in it. Not many years ſince, they were thus naturalized in a ſmall
diſtrict of Lorraine, lying between Dieuſe and Mulée; where they
breed, raiſe their young, depart in the fall, and return again in the

               <p>UPON comparing the different birds of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, I have
perceived ſo many ſtriking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations between that of the preſent article
and thoſe of the four following, that I ſhould have referred them all to
the ſame ſpecies, if I could have collected a ſufficient number of facts
to juſtify this innovation. It is extremely probable that all theſe would
propagate with each other, and that the croſs-breed would be prolific. But
ſtill I obſerve that they continue for a length of time in the ſame
country without intermixing; that they retain their diſcriminating
characters; and that their inſtincts are not quite the ſame. I ſhall
therefore follow the common diviſion, but proteſt againſt the
multiplication of the number of ſpecies, which is ſo fertile a ſource of
error and confuſion.</p>

neſtle among the ruſhes; however, they ſometimes reſort to the high
grounds in rainy ſeaſons. In ſpring they are ſeen by the ſides of the
roads, and in Auguſt they feed in the corn fields. Kra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tells us that they
are fondeſt of millet. In general they ſeek their food like the Buntings,
along the hedges, and in the cultivated ſpots. They keep near the ground, and
ſeldom perch except on the buſhes. They never aſſemble in flocks, and
ſcarcely more than three or four are ſeen at once. They arrive in Lorraine
about the month of April, and depart in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; however, there are always
ſome of them which continue in that province during the winter.—They
are found in Sweden, Germany, England, France, and ſometimes in Italy,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>This little bird is almoſt perpetually on the watch, to
diſcover its foe, and when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcries ſome fowlers, it makes an
inceſſant cry, which is not only teazing, but ſometimes ſcares away the
game. I have ſeen ſportſmen quite out of patience at the notes of this
bird, which are ſomewhat like thoſe of the Sparrow. The Reed Bunting has
beſides a pleaſant warble in the time of hatching, about the month of
May.</p>

difference of habits affords a more marked diſtinction; the Leſbian

                  <p>Lottinger ſent us this bird from Lorraine, where it is very
common.—Its throat, the fore-part of its neck, and its breaſt, are of a
light aſh-colour, ſpeckled with black: the reſt of the under-part of its
head and body rufous, ſpeckled with black; the ſpace round the eyes of a
lighter colour; there is a black ſtreak below the eyes: the ſmall coverts
of the wings are of light cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous without ſpeckles; the others parted by
rufous and black; the firſt quills of the wings black, edged with light
cinereous, the following with rufous; the two middle quills of the tail rufous,
edged with gray, the others partly black and partly white, but the outermoſt
have always a greater ſhare of white; the bill is rufous-brown, and the legs
of a lighter ſhade.</p>
                  <p>Total length ſix inches and a half; the bill five lines and
a half; the tail two inches and four lines, and exceeds the wings by fifteen
lines.</p>
                  <p>The female has a ſort of collar mottled with rufous and
white; all the reſt of the under-part of the body is ruſty-white; the
upper-part of the head is variegated with black, with rufous, and with white,
but the black diſappears behind the head, and the rufous grows more dilute,
ſo <pb n="260" facs="tcp:1084600104:289"/> that an almoſt uniform ruſty-gray is produced.
It has white eye-brows; the cheeks are deep ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fous; the bill orange-yellow at
its baſe, and black at its point; the edges of the lower man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible are
adapted into the upper; the tongue is forked, and the legs are black.</p>
                  <p>One of theſe birds was brought to me the 10th of January; it
had been juſt killed on a ſtone in the middle of the high-road; it weighed
an ounce; its inteſtines meaſured ten inches; it had two very ſmall

lines and a half broad, and filled with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable ſubſtances, and many

the genus; its head is of a gloſſy black, with five white rays nearly
paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, the middle extending to the lower-part of the neck; all the
upper-part of the body is yellow, but deepeſt on the breaſt, from which it
ſpreads upwards and downwards, growing more dilute by imperceptible degrees,
ſo that the origin of the neck, and the laſt of the inferior coverts of the
tail, are almoſt white; a gray tranſverſe bar ſeparates the neck from
the back, which is brown-rufous, variegated with a lighter colour; the rump is
gray; the tail brown, edged with white on both ſides, and delicately tipt
with the ſame; the ſmall coverts of the wings aſh-gray; the uncovered
part of the middle ones white; the great ones brown, edged with rufous; the
quills of the wings blackiſh, edged with white, except thoſe next the body,
which are edged with rufous; the third and fourth are the longeſt of all.
With reſpect to the quills of the tail, the outermoſt, and the one next it
on each ſide, are ſhorter than the reſt; ſo that were the tail equally
divided, though the whole be ſomewhat forked, each of the parts is taper; the

Hudſon's-bay, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps countries ſtill more northerly, are, during the
ſummer months, the favourite abodes of this bird. The exceſſive
ſeverity of theſe inhoſpitable climates changes part of its plumage into
white in winter<note n="†" place="bottom">Thoſe white feathers are black
at the baſe; and ſometimes the black ſhines through the white, and forms
a multitude of little ſpots, as in the individual painted by Friſch, under
the name of <hi>The Spotted White Bunting.</hi> At other times the black collar
of the baſe of each feather extends on a great part of the wing; ſo that a
blackiſh colour is thus produced over all the under-ſide of the body, as in
the Blackiſh and Yellowiſh Finch of Aldrovandus.

ſome variety of appearance from the diverſified intermixture of white,
black, or ruſty; and the combinations of theſe colours are affected by the

                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1084600104:294"/> In winter the head, the neck, the coverts
of the wings, and all the under-part of the body, are in the male white as
ſnow, with a light and almoſt tranſparent tint of ruſty on the head
only; the back black; the quills of the wings, and of the tail, partly black,
partly white. In ſummer the head, the neck, the under-part of the body, and
even the back, are ſtained with tranſverſe ruſty waves of various
intenſity, but never ſo deep as in the female, of which it is the
predominant colour, and diſpoſed in longitudinal ſtripes. In ſome
ſubjects the neck is cinereous, the back cinereous variegated with brown; a
purple tinge round the eyes; a reddiſh caſt on the head<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Schwenckfeld.</bibl>

is alſo variable; ſometimes yellow, ſometimes cinereous at the baſe,

the ſake of their ſong, which conſiſts in an unmeaning cluck, or in a
ſhrill cry reſembling that of the Jay, which they utter when handled: but
to judge fairly of their warble, we ought to hear them in the ſeaſon of
love, when the warmth of paſſion inſpires, and ſoftens the native
ſtrains. We are ignorant alſo of the particulars of their breeding: it is
undoubtedly in the countries where they ſpend the ſummer, but there are not

               <p>THESE birds are migratory birds, and the motive of their
paſſage is not known. Numerous flocks of them are ſeen or rather heard in
the month of September, coming from the Iſland of Cuba, where the rice has
already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained maturity, and directing their courſe to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, where it
is only coming into ear. Theſe remain in Carolina only three weeks, and then
advance towards the north, always in ſearch of more tender grain: and, by
ſucceſſive ſtations, they penetrate as far as Canada, and perhaps
beyond. But what is the moſt ſingular, though there are other ſimilar
inſtances, theſe flocks are compoſed entirely of females. It is
aſcertained, we are told, from numerous diffections, that only the females
paſs in September; but in the beginning of the ſpring, the males and
females are intermingled; and indeed, this is the ſeaſon of the union of
the ſexes.</p>
               <p>The plumage of the females is ruſty over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt its whole
body; that of the males is more <pb n="271" facs="tcp:1084600104:302"/> diverſified: the
fore-part of the head and neck, the throat, the breaſt, and all the
under-part of the body, the upper-part of the back and the thighs, black, with
a mixture of ruſty; the back of the head and neck ruſty; the lower-part of
the back and rump of an olive cinereous; the great ſuperior coverts of the
wings of the ſame colour, edged with whitiſh; the ſmall ſuperior
coverts of the wings, and the ſuperior coverts of the tail, dirty white; the
quills of the wing black, tipt with brown, and edged, the great ones with
ſulphur-colour, and the ſmall ones with gray; the quills of the tail are
nearly like the great quills of the wings, only all terminate in points<note n="*" place="bottom">For this reaſon we have called the bird
<hi>Agripenne.</hi>
                  </note>; laſtly, the bill is cinereous, and the legs
brown. This Ortolan is remarked to be taller than the reſt.</p>
               <p>Total length ſix inches and three-fourths; the bill ſix
lines and a half; the alar extent four inches; the tail two inches and a half,
ſomewhat forked, and exceeding the wings by ten lines.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Rice Bunting, <hi>Emberiza

in Carolina before the end of laſt century, when that nutritious grain was
introduced from Madagaſcar. We may ſuppoſe that a few ſtray birds had
been driven into that province by adverſe winds, and had fared ſo well
among the rice-crops, as to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with their brood the enſuing
ſeaſon: and thus, in the courſe of a few years, a direction would be
given to their general mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations. They arrive in Carolina about September; at
firſt they are very lean, but ſoon grow exceſſively fat, and fly with
difficulty, ſo that they are eaſily ſhot. Their ſtay laſts three
weeks; and both ſexes make a tranſient viſit in the ſpring. A few
remain through the winter in Carolina, and even in Virginia, where they
ſubſiſt on the ſcattered grains of Indian corn.</note>

buſh, or in a tuft of graſs, but always careleſsly. Sometimes it builds
in the low branches of ſhrubs, and is then at more pains. The body of the
neſt conſiſts of ſtraws, moſs, and dry leaves, and is lined with
roots, the fineſt ſtraws, hair, and wool. The eggs are generally four or
five, ſpotted with brown of different ſhade, on a white ground; but the
ſpots are thicker at the large end. The female covers with ſuch ardent
attachment, that often ſhe can be caught by the hand in broad day. The young
are fed with ſmall ſeeds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and even May-flies; but of theſe
laſt, the hard cruſt ſheathing the wings is previouſly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by
the parents. They are however granivorous, and fondeſt of millet and

cannot be decoyed, it is ſaid, by the call. In ſummer they haunt the trees,
the ſides of the hedges and buſhes; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they viſit the
vineyards, but ſcarcely ever penetrate into the heart of the foreſts. In
win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a part of them migrate into other climates, and thoſe which remain

               <p>THE Italians have applied the epithet of <hi>Fooliſh</hi> to
this bird, on account of its incautious diſpoſition, being readily caught
in every ſort of ſnare: but the want of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection is
characteriſtic of the genus, and the Fooliſh Bunting is inconſiderate
only in a higher degree. The name of <hi>Meadow Bunting</hi> is improper; for
the moſt obſervant bird-catchers and fowlers have unanimouſly aſſured
me, that they never ſaw it in the meadows.</p>
               <p>Like the Cirl Bunting, the Fooliſh Bunting is not found in the
northern countries, nor does its name occur in the catalogues of the Swediſh
and Daniſh birds. It prefers ſolitude, and delights in mountainous abodes.
It is very common and well known in the hills round Nantua. Hebert<note n="*" place="bottom">This excellent obſerver has communicated or confirmed the
principal facts of the hiſtory of the Buntings.</note> often ſaw it on the
ground, and upon the cheſnut-trees; and the country people told him, that its
fleſh was excellent meat. Its ſong is very ordinary, and reſembles that
of the Yellow Bunting; and the Pruſſian bird-catchers <pb n="283" facs="tcp:1084600104:315"/> have remarked, that when it is put into a volery among others of a

it chirps <hi>zip, zip.</hi>
                  </note>, its ſize, its figure, are the ſame,
and it differs only by ſome of its habits.</p>
               <p>In the male, all the upper-part is variegated with blackiſh,
and gray; but this gray is purer on the head, and ruſty every-where elſe,
except on ſome of the middle coverts of the wings, where it becomes almoſt
white. The ſame ruſty gray edges almoſt all the quills of the wings and
of the tail, whoſe ground colour is brown, only the two exterior quills of
the tail are edged and tipt with white; the orbits are ruſty white; the
ſides of the head and of the neck are gray; the throat is gray, dotted with
blackiſh, and edged on each ſide and below by a line almoſt black, which
forms an irregular ſort of ſquare with the gray plate on the ſides of the
head; all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-part of the body is fulvous, more or leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but
dotted or variegated with blackiſh on the throat, the breaſt, and the
flanks; the bill and legs are gray.</p>
               <p>Total length ſix inches and one fourth; the bill five or ſix

               <p>THIS is a bird of paſſage, and arrives early in the

Woodcock.</note>. It makes its neſt among the fields of barley, of oats, of
millet, &amp;c. ſeldom on the ſurface of the ground, but three or four
inches above, among the thick ſtrong herbage<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                  </note>. The female lays four, five, and

the diſagreeable cry, <hi>tri, tri, tri, tiritz,</hi> which he retains only
till the month of Auguſt: the notes are ſharper and ſhorter than thoſe
of the Yellow Bunting.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that when the Bunting roſe from the

               <p>The young ones leave the neſt long before they are able to
fly, and take delight to run among the graſs; and this would ſeem to be the
reaſon why the parents build ſo cloſe to the ground. The pointer-dogs
often ſurpriſe them in the chace of quails. The parents ſtill continue to
feed and guard them till they are fledged; but their anxiety for the ſafety
of their brood often betrays them, and if a perſon chances to go near the
ſpot, they circle his head with a doleful air.</p>
               <p>After the family is raiſed, they pour their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous flocks
into the fields, eſpecially among the crops of oats, beans, and the late
ſorts of grain. They migrate ſoon after the Swallows, and it very ſeldom
happens that any of them remain during the winter<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>It is obſerved that the Bunting does not flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from branch
to branch, but alights on the extremity of the higheſt and moſt detached
bough either of a tree or ſhrub, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begins its ſong, which it

                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:1084600104:319"/> The female ſings alſo, after the
young no longer occupy her attention; but this is only when perched on a
branch, and about mid-day. Her ſong is as bad as that of the male. She is
rather ſmaller, but her plumage is nearly the ſame. Both feed upon grain
and ſmall inſects, which they find in the fields and meadows.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are ſpread over all Europe, or rather they
viſit the whole extent of it in their migrations. Olina affirms that they are
more numerous at Rome and in its vicinity than in other countries.
Bird-catchers keep them in a cage to uſe as calls in autumn; and they not
only entice the Fooliſh Buntings into the ſnare, but many other ſmall
birds of different kinds. They are for this purpoſe put in low cages without
any bars or rooſts.</p>
               <p>In the male, the upper-part of the head and body is variegated
with brown and rufous; the throat, and the orbits, light rufous; the breaſt,
and all the reſt of the under-part of the body, yellowiſh-white, ſpotted
with brown on the breaſt and ſides; the ſuperior coverts of the wings,
their quills, and thoſe of the tail, are brown, edged with rufous, more or
leſs dilute; the bill and legs brown gray.</p>
               <p>In the female, the rump is gray, verging upon rufous, without
any ſpots; the ſuperior coverts of the tail the ſame colour, edged with
whitiſh; and in general the quills of the tail, and of the wings, are
bordered with lighter colours.</p>

                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:1084600104:320"/> The bill of theſe birds is of a
remarkable ſhape; the two mandibles are moveable, as in the Ortolans; the
edges are alſo re-entering, as in the Common Bunting, and the junction is
made in a crooked line; the edge of the lower man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible on each ſide, near
the third of its length, makes an obtuſe ſalient angle, and is received by
the correſponding <hi>re-entrant</hi> angle in the upper-mandible, which is
more ſolid and bulky than in moſt other birds; the tongue is narrow, thick,
and tapered to a point, like a tooth-pick; the noſtrils are covered above by
a membrane of a creſcent ſhape, and below by ſmall feathers; the firſt

               <p>NATURE has been liberal to this bird, for ſhe has beſtowed
upon it a beautiful plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and a fine voice. The colours are perfect after
the firſt moulting, but the ſong needs to be aſſiſted and formed by
art. In the ſtate of freedom, the Bulfinch has three cries, which are all
unpleaſant: the firſt, which is the moſt common, is a ſort of whoop; it
begins with one, then two in ſucceſſion, and afterwards three and four,
&amp;c. and, when animated, it ſeems to articulate with force the repeated
ſyllable <hi>tui, tui, tui;</hi> the ſecond is an air of greater extent,
but lower, almoſt hoarſe, <pb facs="tcp:1084600104:332"/>

third is a feeble ſtifled cry, which it vents at intervals, exceedingly

Bulfinch is beſides ſuſceptible of perſonal attachment, which is often

Goldfinches, the Linnets, &amp;c. The male is attentive to his mate, and
Linnaeus relates that he ſometimes holds out to her a ſpider in his bill a
very long time. The young ones begin not to whiſtle till they are able to eat
without aſſiſtance; and then they ſeem inſtinctively benevolent, if
what is related be true, that in a hatch of four, the three elder will feed
their puny brother. After the breeding is over, the parents ſtill continue
aſſociated through the winter, for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeen in pairs:
thoſe which remain in the country, leave the foreſts, and deſcend from
the mountains<note n="*" place="bottom">There are many Bulfinches in the

                  </note>; and in the winter, upon 
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1084600104:336"/> juniper-berries, upon the buds of aſpen, of alder, of
oak, of fruit-trees, of the marſh-willow, &amp;c. whence the name
<hi>Ebourgeonneux</hi> (from <hi>Bourgeon),</hi> which they ſometimes have in

               <p>Some reckon theſe birds attentive and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and their
heavy air and the facility with which they are inſtructed ſeem to favour
that idea; but, on the other hand, their allowing one to get near them, and
their being decoyed into the different ſnares<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner caught many of them during the winter, by a bait of
night-ſhade berries.</note>, indicate want of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection. As their
ſkin is very tender, thoſe which are caught with bird-lime loſe, in
ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to eſcape, part of their down, and even of their quills,
unleſs a perſon ſpeedily diſentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles them. It deſerves to be
remarked, that thoſe which have the fineſt plumage are the leaſt capable
of inſtruction, being older and not ſo tractable: but even the old ones are
ſoon recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the cage, provided that at firſt they have plenty of
food; they can alſo be properly tamed, as I have already noticed, though to
ſucceed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires time and patient attention, which is the reaſon that
perſons ſometimes fail in the attempt. It ſeldom happens that one is
caught alone; the <pb n="303" facs="tcp:1084600104:337"/> other is ſoon enticed to follow its
compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſacriſices its freedom to the calls of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>It has been afferted that the Canary, which breeds with ſo
many other ſpecies, will never ſubmit to the embrace of the Bulfinch, and
it is alleged as the reaſon, that the cock Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch, when in heat, holds his
bill open, which frightens the Canary. But the Marquis de Piolenc aſſures
me, that he ſaw a Bulfinch pair with a hen Canary, which had five young ones
about the beginning of April: their bill was larger than that of Canaries of
the ſame age, and they began to be covered with a blackiſh down, which
ſeemed to ſhew that they had more of the father than the mother:
unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately they all died in performing a ſhort jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. What adds more
weight to this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Friſch gives directions for the experiment: he
adviſes that the cock Bulfinch be the ſmalleſt of its kind, and be kept
long in the ſame volery with the hen Canary: he ſubjoins, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a whole year elapſes before the female will allow the Bulfinch to come near,
or to eat out of the ſame tray; which ſhews that the union is difficult but
not impoſſible.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved that the Bulfinches jerk their tail
briſkly upwards and downwards, though not in ſo remarkable a degree as the
Wagtails. They live five or ſix years; their fleſh is palat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able according
to ſome, and not fit to be caten <pb n="304" facs="tcp:1084600104:338"/> according to others,
by reaſon of its bitterneſs; this muſt depend upon the age, ſeaſon,
and food. They are of the ſize of the Houſe-Sparrow, and weigh about one
ounce. The upper-part of the head, the ring round the bill, and the origin of
the neck, are fine gloſſy black, which extends more or leſs forwards and
backwards<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence the name of Monk, or Pope, which this
bird has in many languages, and that of <hi>Coally-hood,</hi> given to it by

the top of the belly, beautiful red; the abdomen, and the inferior coverts of
the tail and wings, white; the upper-part of the neck, the back, and the
ſhoulders, cinereous; the rump white, the ſuperior coverts and the quills
of the tail, fine black, verging to violet, a whitiſh ſpot on the
outermoſt quills; the quills of the wings blackiſh cinereous, and deeper
the nearer to the body: the laſt of all red on the outſide; the great
coverts of the wings of a fine changing black, terminated with reddiſh
light-gray; the middle ones cinereous; the ſmall ones, blackiſh
aſh-colour, edged with reddiſh; the iris hazel; the bill blackiſh, and
the legs brown.</p>
               <p>The ſides of the head and the fore-part of the neck, the
breaſt, the top of the belly, and in a word, almoſt all that was red in the
male, is vinous aſh-colour in the female, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even the abdomen:
nor has it the fine gloſſy changing black that occurs on the head 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1084600104:339"/> and other parts of the male. I have ſeen a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
however, which had the laſt of the wing-quills edged with red, and which had
no white on the outermoſt of thoſe of the tail. Linnaeus adds, that the tip
of the tongue is divided into ſmall filaments; but I have always found it
quite entire in the male, and ſhaped like a very ſhort tooth-pick.</p>
               <p>In many young Bulfinches which I have obſerved about the end
of June, the fore-head was light rufous, the fore-part of the neck and breaſt
ruſty-brown; the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail fulvous, which
extends and grows more dilute on the ſide; the under-part of the body, more
or leſs duſky; the white ray over the wing deeply tinged with ruſty; the
rump white of different ſhades.—But it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that conſiderable
diverſities will occur.</p>
               <p>Total length ſix inches; the bill five lines, thick and
forked; Kramer remarks, that the two mandibles are moveable, as in the Finches
and Buntings; the alar extent nine inches and one-fourth; the tail two inches
and one-third, ſomewhat forked, (but not always in the females,)
conſiſting of twelve quills; the outer-toe joined by its firſt
<hi>phalanx</hi> to the mid-toe; the hind-nail ſtronger and more hooked than
the reſt.</p>
               <p>The dimenſions of the female when diſſected were as
follows:—inteſtinal tube eighteen inches; veſtiges of a
<hi>coecum;</hi> the <hi>oeſophagus</hi> two inches <pb n="306" facs="tcp:1084600104:340"/>
and a half, dilated like a bag, with a projecting edge next the gizzard, which
is muſcular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many ſmall pebbles, and even two or three ſmall
yellow ſeeds quite entire, though the birds had remained two days and a half
in the cage without eating; the cluſter of the <hi>ovarium</hi> of an

above three inches in length; the <hi>trachea</hi> formed a ſort of knot of a

               <head>VARIETIES of the BULFINCH.</head>
               <p>Sir Robert Sibbald has only a ſingle line on the Bulfinch, and
ſays, that there are ſeveral kinds of it in Scotland: theſe are probably
only the varieties which we ſhall now deſcribe.</p>
               <p>Friſch tells that the Bulfinches may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three
different ſizes: the Marquis de Piolenc was acquainted with two
diſtinguiſhed by their bulk<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſmalleſt, adds
M. de Piolenc, is of the ſize of the Chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch, its body is longer, its
breaſt of a brighter red; and it ſeems wilder than the ordinary
Bulfinch.</note>: and others pretend that thoſe of Nivernois are ſmaller
than thoſe of Picardy. Lottinger aſſures us, that the Bulfinch of the
mountains exceeds that of the plain; and this <pb n="307" facs="tcp:1084600104:341"/> accounts
for the diverſity of bulk, being vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly modified by local ſituation.
But theſe are too numerous to be ſeparately treated: and I ſhall here
take notice only of the varieties of plumage.</p>

ſpeaks of a White Bulfinch that was caught near the village of Friſchbach
in Sileſia, and which had only ſome black feathers on the back. This fact
is confirmed by Deliſle: 
<q rend="inline">"There are in this canton, (of Bereſow in
Siberia,) ſays that excellent aſtronomer, White Bulfinches, whoſe back is
ſomewhat blackiſh, and gray in ſummer: theſe birds have a delicate
pleaſant ſong, much ſuperior to that of European Bulfinches."</q> It is
probable that the northern climate has much contributed to this change of
plumage.</p>

                        <hi>Loxin-Pyrrhula,</hi> var. 1. Linn.</note>. Under this
denomination, I include not only thoſe which are entirely or almoſt black,
but alſo thoſe which have perceptibly begun to aſſume that
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion:—ſuch was what I ſaw at Baron Goula's; its throat and
rump were black; the inferior coverts of its tail, its lower belly, and the top
of its breaſt, variegated with rufous wine-colour and black, and no white
ſpots ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <pb n="308" facs="tcp:1084600104:342"/> upon the laſt quill of the tail.
Thoſe mentioned by Anderſon and Salerne were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of a jet black; that
of Reaumur noticed by Briſſon, was black over the whole body. I have
obſerved one which aſſumed a fine gloſſy black after the firſt
moulting, but which ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a little red on each ſide of the neck,
and a little gray behind the neck, and on the ſmall ſuperior coverts of the
wings; its legs were fleſh-coloured, and the inſide of its bill red: that
of Albin had ſome red feathers under the belly; the five firſt quills of
the wing edged with white; the iris white, and the legs fleſh-coloured<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. White, in his Natural Hiſtory of Selburne, relates alſo an
inſtance of a cock Bulfinch turning dingy, and afterwards black.</note>.
Albin remarks that this bird was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly gentle, like all the Bulfinches.
It often happens that this robe of black diſappears in moulting, and gives
place to the natural colours: but often it renews each time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for
ſeveral years:—ſuch was the caſe with Reaumur's. This would imply
that the change of colour is not the effect of diſeaſe.</p>

                  <p>This bird ſeems to form the ſhade between the European
Bulfinches and the Round-bills of America. It is not larger than the Twite: a
fine black, changing into green, is ſpread over the head, the throat, and all
the upper-part of the body, including the coverts and quills of the tail and of
the wings, or more properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what appears of theſe; for the
inſide is either not black, or is black of a different kind: there is alſo
a very ſmall white ſpot on each wing, and three ſpots of the ſame
colour, but larger, the one on the top of the head, and the 
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1084600104:347"/> two other below the eyes. All the under-part of the body
is white; the feathers of the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail are
frizzled in ſome ſubjects, for we may reckon the Frizzled Bulfinch of
Brazil as belonging to this ſpecies, ſince the ſole difference
conſiſts in the contexture of the plumage, which is ſuperficial and
fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating. It is probable that Frizzled Bulfinches are cock-birds, Nature
ſeeming in general to diſtinguiſh the males by ſtrength and beauty. But
how, it would be aſked, is the male found in Brazil, and the female in
Africa? I anſwer, 1. That the native climate of birds that paſs through
different hands is very uncertain. 2. If theſe were brought alive to Paris,
they might alſo have been carried from South America to Africa. Any perſon
who will draw the compariſon between theſe two birds, will readily admit
one of the two ſuppoſitions, rather than refer them to two different

                  <p>America produces alſo Round-bills, which, though analogous
to the Bulfinches, are ſtill ſo different as to merit a diſtinct
denomination.</p>
                  <p>The preſent continues the whole year paired with its female.
It is lively and tame, living near dwellings, and haunting grounds which have
been under cultivation, but lately aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. It feeds upon grain and fruits;
and, hopping about, it emits a cry much like that of the Sparrow, but
ſhriller. It forms with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reddiſh herb a ſmall round neſt of
about two inches diameter within, and places it in the ſame ſhrub that
furniſhes its ſubſiſtence. The female lays three or four eggs.</p>
                  <p>The upper-part of the head, the neck, and the back, are
brown-gray; the coverts of the wings, their quills, and thoſe of the tail,
are of the ſame colour nearly, and bordered with white, or light cheſnut;
the throat, the fore-part of the neck, the under-part of the body, the inferior
coverts of the tail, and the rump, deep cheſnut; the bill and legs brown.</p>

                  <p>Briſſon mentions two American blue Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finches, of which
he makes two ſeparate ſpecies: but as they are both natives of the ſame
climate, are of the ſame ſize, of the ſame ſhape nearly, and, except
the wings, tail, and bill, are of the ſame blue colour; I ſhall conſider
them as form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſingle ſpecies, and regard the differences as
reſulting from the influence of climate.</p>
                  <p>In both of them the prevailing colour is deep blue. The one
from South America has a ſmall black ſpot between the bill and the eye; the
quills of the tail, thoſe of the wings, and the great coverts of theſe, are
edged with blue; the bill is blackiſh, and the legs gray.</p>
                  <p>That of North America has at the baſe of its bill a black
circular zone, which extending forms a junction between the eyes; the quills of
the tail and thoſe of the wings, and their great coverts, brown, tinged with
green; their middle coverts red, forming a tranſverſe bar of the ſame
colour; the bill brown, and the legs black. The plumage of the female is
uniform, and of a deep brown, intermixed with a little blue.</p>

that its ſong is monotonous, and conſiſts of a repetition of the ſame

               <p>IT appears to us that this bird ſhould be ranged between the
genus of the Widow and of the Bulfinch. Like the former, it has two long
feathers in the middle of its tail; and the latter it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles by the form
of its bill, which would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly that of the Bulfinch, were the lower
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible convex as the upper. But the tail of the Coly differs from that of
the Widow, becauſe it conſiſts of tapered feathers, of which the two
laſt project only three or four inches beyond the reſt; whereas the
Widow-bird, beſides the true tail, which is a bundle of feathers of equal
lengths attached to the rump, has appendices that in the different ſpecies of
this genus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two, four, and even ſix or eight feathers, extending to
double or triple the length of the true tail. In the Widow-birds too the webs
of the projecting feathers are equal on both ſides, and pretty long, and
taper imperceptibly from the origin to the extremity, except in the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican
and Shaft-tailed kinds; the former hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its webs very ſhort, and quickly
contracting towards the tips; the latter alſo very ſhort, but which
uniformly lengthen and expand at the tips. In all the Colies, the feathers of
the tail, whether thoſe which properly belong to it, or thoſe which project
from it, have vanes that <pb n="322" facs="tcp:1084600104:359"/> continually diminiſh from the
inſertion to the termination. Thus the real affinity between the tail of the
Widow-birds, and that of the Colies, conſiſts in its length; and this
analogy is the cloſeſt in the caſe of the Dominican Widow.</p>
               <p>M. Mauduit has made two important obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on this
ſubject. The firſt is, that the long tails, the appendices, and other
ornaments of certain birds, are not peculiar additions, but only the greater
extenſion of the parts common to all the feathered tribes. Thus long tails
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the augmented growth of the quills of the tail; and creſts
are derived from the enlargement of the feathers on the head. The muſtachoes
of the Paradiſe bird appear to be only the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſlender
narrow plumules, which in all birds cover the <hi>meatus auditorius
externus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> The external aperture of
the ear.</note>. The exuberant growth of the axillary feathers give riſe to
the long floating feathers which ſhoot from under the wings in the Common
Paradiſe, and of thoſe which preſent the double wings in the King
Paradiſe. When theſe feathers lie flat, they ſtretch towards the tail;
but when they are diſplayed they make angles with the axis of the body. They
differ from all other feathers, as their webs are equal on both ſides of the
ſhaft. They reſemble oars, and may ſerve to direct the bird's motion. And
thus all the ornaments of plumage are derived from the mere exuberance or
production of parts uſually leſs apparent.—<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1084600104:360"/>The
ſecond obſervation of M. Mauduit is, that theſe decorations are rare in
the cold and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate climates in both hemiſpheres, but are pretty frequent
in the hot countries, eſpecially in the old continent. Scarce any long-tailed
birds are found in Europe, except the Pheaſant, the Cock, which alſo is
often creſted, and has long floating feathers on the ſides; the Magpie, and

               <p>The Colies belong to the ancient continent, and are found in the

               <p>THESE birds are ſmall and handſome; the largeſt are not
equal in ſize to a Sparrow, and the others are inferior to that of the Wren.
The general characters are theſe: the bill is ſhort, ſtrait, and
compreſſed on the ſides near the tip; the upper-mandible is convex above,
and ſlightly ſcallopped on the edges, rather longer than the
lower-mandible, which is plain and ſtraight.</p>
               <p>In all theſe birds, the tail is ſhort and ſquare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, and

the Calao, viz. the mid-toe is cloſely connected to the outer-toe by a
membrane, as far as the third joint, and the inner-toe as far as the firſt
joint only. But as much as in that circumſtance they reſemble the Cock of

                  </note>, to which they bear no analogy,
except in this diſpoſition of the toes and in the ſquare ſhape of the
tail: for, beſides the total diſproportion in ſize, the Cock of the Rock
being as large, compared with the Manakins, as the common hen contraſted with
a Sparrow, there are many other obvious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which diſtinguiſh them:
their bill is much ſhorter in proportion, they are generally not creſted,
and in thoſe which have a creſt, it is not double, as in the Cock of the
Rock, but formed by ſingle feathers, ſomewhat longer than the reſt. We
ought therefore to remove from the Manakins, not only the Horn-bills, but the
Cock of the Rock, and reckon them an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent genus.</p>
               <p>The natural habits common to them all were not known, and the
obſervations which have been made are ſtill inſufficient to admit an
exact detail. We ſhall only relate the remarks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us by Sonini
of Manoncour, who ſaw many of theſe birds in their native climates. They
inhabit the immenſe foreſts in the warm parts of America, and never emerge
from their receſſes to viſit the cleared grounds or the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the
plantations. They fly with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſwiftneſs, but always at a
ſmall height, <pb n="329" facs="tcp:1084600104:367"/> and to ſhort diſtances; they never
perch on the ſummits of trees, but on the middle branches; they feed upon
ſmall wild fruits, and alſo eat inſects. They generally occur in ſmall
bodies of eight or ten of the ſame ſpecies, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intermingled
with other flocks of the ſame genus, or even of a different genus, ſuch as
the Cayenne Warblers, &amp;c. It is commonly in the morning that they are found
thus aſſembled, and then ſeem to be joyous, and warble their delicate
little notes; the freſhneſs of the air ſeems to inſpire the ſong, for
they are ſilent during the burning heat of the day, and diſperſe and
retire to the ſhade of the thickeſt parts of the foreſt. This habit is
obſerved indeed in many kind of birds, and even in thoſe of the woods of
France, where they collect to ſing in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening; but the
Manakins never aſſemble in the evening, and continue together only from
ſun-riſe to nine or ten o'clock in the forenoon, and remain ſeparate
during the reſt of the day and the ſucceeding night. In general, they
prefer a cool humid ſituation, though they never frequent marſhes or the
margins of lakes.</p>
               <p>The name of the <hi>Manakin</hi> was beſtowed on theſe birds
by the Dutch ſettlers at Surinam. We know ſix diſtinct ſpecies, but we

                  <p>This ſpecies has been well deſcribed by Marc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave. It is
the largeſt of all the Manakins; its total length is four inches and a half,
and it is nearly of the bulk of a Sparrow; the upper-part of its head is
covered with fine red feathers, longer than the reſt, and which the bird can
erect at pleaſure, which gives it the appearance of being creſted; the back
and the ſmall ſuperior coverts of the wings are of a beautiful blue, the
reſt of the plumage is velvet black; the iris is of a fine ſapphire colour;
the bill is black, and the legs are red.</p>
                  <p>The Abbe Aubry, Rector of St. Louis, has in his cabinet a bird
by the name of <hi>Tiſe-guacu of Cuba,</hi> which is perhaps a variety of the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ariſing from the difference of age or ſex; the only
diſtinction being, that the large feathers on the upper-part of the head are
of a diluter red, and even ſomewhat yellowiſh. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation given to
it would ſeem to imply that <pb n="331" facs="tcp:1084600104:369"/> it is found in the
Iſland of Cuba, and perhaps in other parts of America; but it is very rare at
Cayenne, and is a bird of ſhort flight, and therefore it could hardly paſs
from the continent to Cuba.</p>
                  <p>The Green Manakin with a red creſt is the young of this
ſpecies; ſeveral Manakins have been obſerved, whoſe plumage was

in ſmall flocks with the other Manakins, but intermingle not with them; they
remain for the moſt part on the ground, and rarely perch on the branches, and
then they uniformly prefer the low ones. They ſeem to live more upon
inſects than fruits: they are often found among the lines of ants, which

it has blackiſh legs, but a white bill, ſo that notwithſtanding the

                  <p>We preſume that theſe three birds are only varieties of
the ſame ſpecies, for they are exactly of the ſame ſize, being only
three inches and eight lines in length; whereas all the preceding ſpecies,
which have been placed in the order of their magnitude, are four inches and a
half, and four inches and three-fourths, &amp;c. Theſe three are likewiſe
of the ſame ſhape, and even their colours are ſimilar, if we except
thoſe of the head, which in the firſt are of a fine yellow, in the ſecond
of a bright red, and in the third of a beautiful blue; there is no other
ſenſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the plumage, which is all uniformly of a fine
gloſſy black: the feathers which cover the thighs are of a pale yellow,
with an oblong ſpot of bright red on the exterior ſurface. In 
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1084600104:376"/> the firſt indeed, the bill is whitiſh and the legs
black; in the ſecond, the bill is black and the legs cinereous; and in the
third, the bill is brown-gray, and the legs reddiſh: but theſe ſlight
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences do not appear ſufficient to conſtitute three ſeparate
ſpecies, and perhaps one of them is only the female of another. However,
Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, to whom I communicated this article, aſſured me that he never
ſaw, in the White-headed Manakin, the red feathers that cover the knee in the
Golden-headed Manakin: if this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference were invariable, we might infer that
theſe formed two ſeparate ſpecies of Manakins: but Sonini aſſured us,
that he has ſeen White-headed Manakins with red feathers on their knees, and
there is ſome reaſon to ſuſpect that the ſpecimens obſerved by
Mauduit were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Manakins are found in the ſame ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and
are pretty common in Guiana. It would even appear that the ſpecies is
ſpread through the ſeveral other warm countries, as Brazil and Mexico. We
have learnt nothing particular in regard to their inſtincts and oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. We
are certain only that, like the other Manakins, they conſtantly live in the
woods, and that they have the chirping common to the whole genus, except the
Nut-cracker.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Pipra

                  <p>This differs from the preceding by the colours of its head,
which is gloſſy black like the reſt of the plumage, except a kind of
white collar which riſes on the neck, and tapers to a point on the breaſt.
It is exactly of the ſame ſize as the three preceding, being only three
inches eight lines in length. We know not from what country it is brought,
having ſeen it only in private cabinets, where it was mentioned by this name
without any other indication. Sonini never met with it in Guiana; however, it
is probably, like the three others, a native of the warm climates in
America.</p>

who had not ſeen the bird, adds the dimenſions and other details, which are
furniſhed neither by Seba, nor by any other author. It is alſo ſtrange
that Seba ſhould beſtow the appellation of <hi>Mia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catototl</hi> upon this
bird, which he ſays was brought from Brazil; for that word is not in the
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that country, but is a Mexican word, and ſignifies <hi>the
Maize-bird.</hi> But that Seba was miſtaken in this application is evinced by
the circumſtance that Fernandez employs the ſame term in deſcribing a
Mexican bird which is very different. His words are theſe:— 
<q>
                        <hi>Of the Miacatototl,</hi> or <hi>Maize-bird.</hi>

it uſually ſits upon the ſhoots of maize; the belly is paliſh, and the

deſcription of Seba, Briſſon has ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to range this bird among the
Manakins; but if he had inſpected the figure, though it is a very bad one, he

                  <p>THIS ſpecies is new. It is found in Guiana, but rare. M. de
Manoncour preſented a ſpecimen to the king's cabinet. It is
diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a very long white creſt, conſiſting of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
about an inch in length, and which it erects at pleaſure. It differs from the
Manakins by its ſize, being ſix inches long; whereas the largeſt of the
Manakins is only four inches and a half; the tail too is long and tapered,
which in the Manakins is ſhort and ſquare; and the bill is much longer in
proportion, and more hooked than that of the Manakins. Indeed, the only
property in which it reſembles the Manakins is, the arrangement of the toes;
and but for this character it might be ranged with the Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters: we may
regard it as forming the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſhade. We are unacquainted with its
oeconomy.</p>

               <p>THOUGH this bird is of an uniform colour, it is one of the
moſt beautiful of South Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; for this colour is very beautiful, and its
plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage nicely tapered. It feeds upon fruits, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for want of ſeeds;
ſince it differs from the gallinaceous tribe by the ſhape of its toes only,
which are connected by a membrane, the firſt and ſecond as far as the third
joint, and the ſecond with the third no farther than the firſt joint. The
tail is very ſhort and ſquare, as are ſome coverts of the wings;
ſeveral of theſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have a ſort of fringe on each ſide, and the
firſt great feather of each wing is ſcalloped from the tip to one third of
its length: but what cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizes it the beſt is, a beautiful creſt on
the crown, longitudinal, and of a ſemicircular form. In the minute
deſcriptions which Briſſon and Voſmaër have given, this creſt is
imperfectly depicted; it is not ſingle, but double, conſiſting 
<pb facs="tcp:1084600104:387"/>

                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:1084600104:388"/> of two inclined planes that meet
at the vertex. In other reſpects their deſcriptions are accurate, except
that they are applicable only to the male. The plumage of the male is of a fine
red; that of the female is entirely brown, only there are ſome ſhades of
ruſt-colour on the rump, the tail, and the feathers of the wings. The creſt
of the female is alſo double, but no ſo thick, ſo tall, ſo round, or
ſo far protruded on the bill, as in the male. Both male and female are
generally thicker and larger than the Ring-pigeon; but the different
individuals probably vary in ſize; for Briſſon repreſents this bird of
the bulk of a Roman-pigeon, and Voſmaër aſſerts that it is rather
ſmaller than the Common Pigeon. This difference might alſo be occaſioned
by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſtuffing the ſpecimens; but in the natural ſtate the
female, though ſomewhat ſmaller than the male, is undoubtedly much larger
than the Common Pigeon.</p>
               <p>The male aſſumes not the fine red till he has attained
ſome age; the firſt year he is only brown like the female; but as he grows
up, his plumage becomes marked with points and ſpots of rufous, which
gradually deepen into red, though perhaps perfected before advanced age.</p>
               <p>Though this bird muſt have attracted the notice of all who
ever ſaw it, no traveller has deſcribed its habits and oeconomy. Sonini de
Manoncour is the firſt who has obſerved it with attention. It lodges not
only in the deep clefts <pb n="348" facs="tcp:1084600104:389"/> of the rocks, but even in the
large dark caverns which totally exclude the ſolar rays; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that has induced many to believe it to be a nocturnal bird; whereas it flies
and ſees diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly in the day-time: however, it ſeems na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to
prefer gloomy receſſes, ſince it is moſt frequent in caves which cannot
be entered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light of torches. We may therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that
their eyes are conſtructed like thoſe of cats, and adapted both for the day
and the night. The male and female are equally lively, and extremely wild. It
is impoſſible to ſhoot them, unleſs the perſon be concealed behind a
rock, where he muſt often wait ſeveral hours before an opportunity occurs;
for the inſtant they perceive him, they eſcape to a diſtance by a flight
which is rapid, though rather low and ſhort. They feed upon ſmall wild
fruits, and uſually ſcrape the ground, clap their wings, and ſhake
themſelves like the dunghill fowls; but they neither crow like the cock, nor
cluck like the hen. Their cry reſembles the ſound of the ſyllable
<hi>ké,</hi> pronounced with a ſhrill drawling tone. They conſtruct
their neſt rudely in the holes of rocks with ſmall dry ſticks; and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lay two white ſpherical eggs, which are of the ſize of thoſe of
pigeons.</p>
               <p>The males emerge oftener from their caverns than the females,
which ſeldom appear, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably do not quit their retreats except in the
night. They can eaſily be tamed, and M. de <pb n="349" facs="tcp:1084600104:390"/> Manoncour
ſaw one at the Dutch-poſt on the river Maroni, which was allowed freely to
live and run about with the poultry.</p>
               <p>They are found in great numbers on the mountain Luca, near
Oyapoc, and on the mountain Courouaye, near the river Aprouack; and theſe are
the only parts in this region of America whence we can expect to procure
theſe birds. They are much eſteemed for the ſake of their beautiful
plumage, and are very ſcarce and dear; becauſe the ſavages and negroes,
whether from ſuperſtition or fear, will not venture into the dark caverns
where they lodge.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Pipra

                  <p>There is another ſpecies, or rather variety of the Cock of
the Rock, which is found in the provinces of Peru: its tail is much longer than
that of the preceding, and its feathers have not ſquare ends; its wings are
not fringed; inſtead of an uniform red, both wings and tail are black, and
the rump cinereous; the creſt alſo is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, being lower and

that we may regard it as a variety of the ſame ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>We might conſider theſe birds as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of
our dunghill poultry in the New World; but I am told that, in the interior
parts of Guiana and Mexico, there are wild fowls which bear ſtill more
analogy. Theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed much ſmaller, being ſcarcely of the ſize of
a Common Pigeon; they are generally brown and rufous; but they have the ſame
ſhape, the ſame little fleſhy comb on the head, and the ſame port as
our ordinary fowl; their tail is alſo ſimilar in ſhape and poſition,
and the males have the crow of the Cock, though feebler. The ſavages who
inhabit the remote tracts are perfectly well acquainted with theſe birds, but
have never reduced them to the domeſtic ſtate; nor is this in the leaſt
ſurpriſing, for they have tamed none of the animals which might have proved
uſeful, eſpecially the Hoccos or Curaſſos, the Marails and the Agamis,
among the birds; and the Tapirs, the Pecaris, and the Agamis, among the
quadrupeds. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ancient Mexicans, who were civilized,
domeſticated ſome animals, and particularly theſe ſmall brown fowls.
Gemelli Carreri relates, that they were called <hi>Chiacchialacca;</hi> and he
ſubjoins, that they were preciſely like our common poultry, only rather
ſmaller, and their feathers browniſh.</p>

               <p>FEW birds have ſuch beautiful plumage as the Cotingas; all
thoſe who have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing them, whether travellers or
naturaliſts, ſeem to have been charmed, and ſpeak of them with rapture.
Nature has ſelected her choiceſt and her richeſt colours, and ſpread
them with elegance and profuſion: the painting glows with all the tints of
blue, of violet, of red, of orange, of purple, of ſnow-white, and gloſſy
black; ſometimes theſe tints melt into each other by the ſweeteſt
gradations; at other times they are contraſted with wonderful taſte: the
various reflexions heighten and enliven the whole. The merit is intrinſic; it
is expreſſive; it is inimitable.</p>
               <p>All the ſpecies, or, if we chuſe, all the branches of the
brilliant family of the Cotingas belong to the New Continent; and there is no
foundation for what ſome have alleged, that they are found in Senegal. They
appear to delight in warm countries; they ſeldom occur ſouth of Brazil, or
roam north of Mexico: and conſequently they would hardly traverſe the
immenſe ſtretch of ocean that ſeparates the continents in thoſe
latitudes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:1084600104:393"/> All that we know of their habits is, that
they never perform diſtant journies, but have only periodical flittings,
which are confined within a narrow circle: they appear twice a-year in the
plantations; and though they arrive nearly at the ſame time, they are never
obſerved in flocks. They generally haunt the ſides of creeks in ſwampy
ground<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Edwards, who was unacquainted with the
oeconomy of the Cotingas, conjectured, from the ſtructure of their feet, that
they frequented marſhes.</note>, which has occaſioned ſome to call them
water-fowls. They find among the aquatic plants abundance of inſects, on
which they feed, and particularly what are termed <hi>karias</hi> in America,
and which, according to ſome, are wood-lice; and according to others, a
ſort of ants. The creoles have, it is ſaid, more motives than one for
hunting after theſe birds;—the beauty of the plumage, which pleaſes
the eye; and, according to ſome, the delicacy of the fleſh, which flatters
the palate. But it is difficult to obtain both; for the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is often
ſpoiled in attempting to ſkin the bird; and this is probably the reaſon
why ſo many imperfect ſpecimens are now brought from America. It is ſaid
that they alight among the rice-crops and do conſiderable injury: if this be
true, the creoles have ſtill another reaſon for deſtroying them<note n="†" place="bottom">The little which I have related of the habits of the
Cotingas was communicated by M. Aublet: but I muſt add, that M. de Manoncour
heard that the fleſh of the Cotingas was much eſteemed at Cayenne; perhaps
this is true only of ſome ſpecies.</note>.</p>

                  <p>The greateſt portion of each of its feathers, reckoning from
their inſertion, is black; but as the tips are beryl, this is really the
predominant colour of the plumage. In ſome parts of the upper ſurface of
the body the dark hue ſtrikes through the coverts, but then it forms only
ſmall ſpecks; and it is totally concealed by the blue in the
under-ſurface of the body: only, in ſome ſpecimens, there are, near the
rump and the thighs, a few ſmall feathers, which are partly black, and partly
purple-red.</p>
                  <p>The throat and a part of the neck are covered with a broad
ſpot of a very bright violet-purple, which in different ſubjects varies in
extent. The coverts of the wings, their quills, and thoſe of the tail, are
almoſt all black, edged or tipt with beryl; the bill and legs are black.</p>
                  <p>This bird is found in Cayenne; it is of the ſize of the
Red-wing, and faſhioned like the preceding, except that the wings, when
cloſed, reach not the middle of the tail, which is rather longer.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Ampelis Cayana:—</hi>

                  <p>Linnaeus is the firſt, and even the only one, who has
hitherto deſcribed this bird: the head, the top of the neck, the quills of
the wings and of the tail, are black; the throat, the breaſt, the lower-part
of the back, the outer edge of the quills of the wings, light blue: there is a
tranſverſe bar of light blue on the ſuperior coverts of the ſame
quills; the belly is yellowiſh-white, and the ſides are of a deeper caſt.
Linnaeus does not inform us from what country it is brought; but it is probable

of the head, the neck, the back, and the wings are ſhaded with deep tints,

a ſort of border which ſurrounds the ſcarlet cap, and this is a little

                  <p>The moſt remarkable character of theſe birds is, a ſort
of caruncle under the bill as in the turkies, but differently organized: it is
flaccid and pendulous when the bird is compoſed at reſt; but when the
paſſions are rouzed, it ſwells in every dimenſion, and, in this ſtate
of tenſion, is more than two inches long, and three or four lines in
circumference at the baſe: this effect is produced by air, which is driven
through an aperture of the palate into the cavity of the caruncle and inflates
it.</p>
                  <p>This caruncle differs from that of the turkey alſo in
another circumſtance; it is covered with ſmall white feathers; and
beſides, it is not peculiar to the male. The plumage of the female is however
entirely different: for in the male the bill and legs are black, all the reſt
of a pure ſpotleſs white, except ſome tints of yellow on the rump, and on
ſome of the quills of the tail and of the wings: but in the female the colour
is not ſo uniform; the upper-part of the head and body, the ſuperior
coverts of the wings, and moſt of the quills of the wings and of the tail,
are olive mixed with gray; the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral <pb n="364" facs="tcp:1084600104:406"/> quills of the

part of the belly gray, edged with olive and tipt with yellow, and the coverts
of the lower ſurface of the tail lemon-yellow; the inferior coverts of the

tongue is ſhort; its noſtrils uncovered; its iris bluiſh-black; its bill
black; its legs blackiſh. It has ſeveral black fleſhy appendices under
the neck, nearly of a lance-ſhape, which marks a ſlight affinity to the
preceding at the ſame time that it diſcriminates it from all the other
Cotingas.</p>
                  <p>The Variegated Cotinga is as large as a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; the length of
its bill, which is an inch, equals the greateſt breadth; its legs are twelve
or thirteen lines; its tail is three inches, and is almoſt wholly beyond the
reach of the wings.</p>
                  <p>The female is rather ſmaller than the male, and has not the
fleſhy appendices under the neck; it reſembles the Fieldfare in ſhape and
ſize; its plumage is a mixture of blackiſh, of brown, and light green; but
theſe colours are diſtributed ſo, that the brown predominates on the
back, and the light-green on the throat, the breaſt, and the under-part of
the body.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds grow plump and juicy. The male has a very
ſtrong voice, and inflected in two different ways; ſometimes it reſembles
the noiſe occaſioned by ſtriking a cutting inſtrument againſt a wedge
of iron <hi>(kock, kick);</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is like the jarring of a
bell that is crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>(kur, kur, kur).</hi> It is heard in no part of the

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1084600104:408"/> name, <hi>Ave de Verano,</hi> i. e. <hi>Bird of

furrow which runs through its whole length; and alſo that its wind-pipe is
very wide, which perhaps contributes to the ſtrength of its voice.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Ampelis Variegata:—</hi>

               <p>IF the beauty of plumage formed the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic feature of
the Cotingas, this bird, and that of the preceding article, would be regarded
as degenerate branches of the original ſtock. The <hi>Guirarou</hi> has
nothing remarkable either in its colours, or in their diſtribution, if we
except a black bar below the eyes, and the tint of the iris, which is
ſapphire: a uniform light gray is ſpread over the head, the neck, the
breaſt, and all the under-part of the body; the thighs, and the upper-part of
the body, cinereous; the quills, and coverts of the wings, blackiſh; the
quills of the tail black, tipt with white, and its ſuperior coverts white;
laſtly, the bill and legs are black.</p>
               <p>The flat ſhape, and the ſhortneſs of the bill, the
loudneſs of its voice, which is ſomewhat like that of the Blackbird, but
ſhriller, and its haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the margin of water, are the chief
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which the <hi>Guirarou</hi> reſembles the Cotingas; its
ſize is alſo nearly the ſame, and it inhabits the ſame climates: yet
Willughby has referred it to the White-ears; and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ornithologiſts have reckoned it a Fly-catcher. <pb n="368" facs="tcp:1084600104:410"/> For my
own part, I ſhall not venture to aſſign its genus; I ſhall retain the
name which it bears in its native climate, and wait for fuller obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made on ſeveral living ſubjects, which will point out its proper
arrangement. The <hi>Guira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> are very common in the interior parts of
Guiana, but are not found at all in Cayenne; they ramble little; many occur
generally in the ſame diſtrict; they perch generally on the loweſt
branches of certain large trees, where they pick up ſeeds and inſects, on
which they ſubſiſt. From time to time, they cry all at once, allowing an
interval between each ſound; this cry, though harſh in itſelf, is
cheering muſic to travellers who have loſt their way in the immenſe
foreſts of Guiana, for it directs them to the banks of a river.</p>
               <p>The ſubject obſerved by M. De Manoncour was nine inches and
a half total length; its bill twelve inches long, ſeven broad, five thick at

               <p>IN the low, ſwampy, thin-ſettled lands of South America, the
ſwarms of inſects and loathſome reptiles ſeem to predominate over all
the reſt of the animal creation. In Guiana and Brazil<note n="*" place="bottom">This is alſo the caſe in many other parts of America. Piſo
relates, that in Brazil, and even in the wet grounds of Peru, the quantity of
ants is ſo enormous, that they devour all the ſeeds which are committed to
the earth; and though fire and water be employed to extirpate them, the
attempts have hitherto failed of ſucceſs. He adds, that it were much to be
wiſhed that Nature had ordained in thoſe countries many ſpecies of
animals like the Ant-eaters <hi>(Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecophagae,</hi> Linn.), which might bore
into the hillocks, and extract theſe inſects with their long tongue. Some
of the ants are not larger than thoſe of Europe; others are twice or thrice
as large. They raiſe hills as large as hay-ſtacks; and their number is ſo
vaſt, that they make tracks ſeveral feet broad in the fields, and in the
woods, and often through an extent of many leagues.—Fernandez ſays
alſo that theſe ants are larger, and pretty much like our winged-ants, and
that their hills are of an incredible height and width.</note> the ants are
ſo aſtoniſhingly multiplied, that their hills are ſome fathoms wide,
and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral feet in height, and proportionally populous as thoſe of
Europe, of which the largeſt are only two or three feet in diameter; ſo
that they may be computed to contain two or three hundred times the number of
ants. Yet they exceed ſtill more in number; and in the wilderneſſes of
Guiana they are an hundred times more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than in any part of the ancient
continent. <pb n="371" facs="tcp:1084600104:413"/> But (ſuch is the ſyſtem of Nature!)
every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the deſtined prey of another; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and
deſtruction are ever conjoined. We have in the former work given an account
of the <hi>Tamanoir,</hi> of the <hi>Tamandua,</hi> and of the other quadrupeds
which feed upon ants; we are now to write the hiſtory of a kind of birds
which live alſo upon theſe inſects.—We were unacquainted with the
exiſtence of the Anters till M. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noncour preſented the ſpecimens to
the King's cabinet.</p>
               <p>The Anters are natives of Guiana, and are analogous to none of
the European birds; but in the ſhape of their body, of their bill, of their
feet, and of their tails, they bear a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the
ſhort-tailed Thruſhes <hi>(Breves),</hi> which our nomenclators have
improperly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the Blackbirds: but as the ſhort-tailed
Thruſhes inhabit the Philippines, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luccas, the iſland of Ceylon,
Bengal, and Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar, it is more than probable that they are not of the
ſame race with the Anters of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Theſe appear indeed to conſtitute
a new genus, for which we are wholly indebted to M. de Manoncour, whom I have
ſo often cited for his extenſive knowledge of foreign birds: he has
preſented above an hundred and ſixty different ſpecies to the Royal
cabinet; and has alſo been ſo obliging as to communicate to me all the
obſervations which he made in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to Senegal and America. I have on
many <pb n="372" facs="tcp:1084600104:414"/> occaſions availed myſelf of this information;
and in particular I have formed entirely from it the hiſtory of the
Anters.</p>
               <p>In French Guiana, and indeed in all countries where natural
hiſtory is little known, names are applied to animals from the ſlighteſt
analogies. This has been the caſe with the Anters: they were obſerved to
perch ſeldom, and run like Partridges; but as they were inferior to theſe
birds in ſize, they were diſtinguiſhed at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne by the appellation of
<hi>Little Partridges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe birds are neither Partridges, nor Blackbirds, nor
ſhort-tailed Thruſhes; only they reſemble the laſt in their chief
external charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Their legs are long; their tail and wings ſhort; the
nail of the hind-toe more hooked, and longer than thoſe of the fore-toes; the
bill ſtrait and lengthened; the upper-mandible ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped at its extremity,
which bends at the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lower mandible, and projects about a line
beyond it; but their tongue is ſhort, and beſet at the tip with ſmall
cartilaginous and fleſhy threads. Their colours are alſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
and it is very probable that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts are diſſimilar, ſince
they inhabit widely diſtant climates. When we deſcribed the ſhort-tailed
Thruſhes, we were unable to give any account of their natural habits, ſince
no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers had taken notice of them, and therefore we cannot draw any
compariſon with thoſe of the American Anters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:1084600104:415"/> In general the Anters keep in flocks, and
feed upon ſmall inſects, and chiefly ants, which are for the moſt part
ſimiliar to thoſe of Europe. They are almoſt always found upon the
ant-hills, which in the interior tracts of Guiana, are more than twenty feet in
diameter, and whoſe inſect nations retard the extenſion of cultivation,
and even conſume the proviſions of life.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral ſpecies of Anters, which, though very
different in appearance, often aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate together; the large ones and the
ſmall, the long-tailed and the ſhort-tailed, are found on the ſame
ſpot. Indeed, if we except the principal kind, which are very few, it is rare
to find in the reſt two ſubjects perfectly alike; and we may ſuppoſe
that this diverſity ariſes from the intermixture of the ſmall ones: ſo
that we muſt regard them as mere varieties, and not diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
               <p>In all theſe birds the wings and tail are very ſhort, and
therefore ill calculated for flying; accordingly they only trip along the
ground, and hop among the low branches; and though lively and active, they
never ſhoot through the air.</p>
               <p>The voice of the Anters is various in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies,
and in ſome it is very ſingular.</p>
               <p>As inſects are the chief food of theſe birds, they ſeek
the ſolitary tracts where thoſe are not moleſted by the intruſion of
man, and ſwarm in abundance. They live in the thickeſt and the 
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1084600104:416"/> remoteſt foreſts, and never viſit the ſavannas,
the cleared grounds, and ſtill leſs the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of plantations. They
employ dry herbs careleſsly interwoven in the conſtruction of their
neſts, which are hemiſpherical, and two, three, or four inches in diameter,
and ſuſpend them by the two ſides on the buſhes, two or three feet from
the ground. They lay three or four eggs, which are almoſt round.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of moſt of theſe birds is unpalatable food, and
has an oily rank taſte, and when opened, the digeſted maſs of ants, and
of other inſects they ſwallow, exhales a putrid offenſive ſmell.</p>

birds of this genus. It is never ſeen in flocks, and ſeldom in pairs; and
as it is generally alone among the others, and is larger than them, it is

is far from being ſo lively as the reſt, who hop around it. It frequents
the ſame ſpots, and feeds alſo upon inſects, eſpecially ants. The
female, as in all the other ſpecies of this genus, is larger than the
male.</p>
                  <p>Its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail
is ſeven inches and a half; its bill is brown, ſomewhat hooked, fourteen
lines long, and five lines thick at the baſe, which is beſet with ſmall

fourteen lines; the legs are brown, and two inches-long.</p>
                  <p>The under-ſide of the body is variegated with brown rufous,

ſounds, which is as rapid as the quick ſtrokes of a bell, continues about

                  <p>This was called by M. de Manoncour, the <hi>Muſician of
Cayenne;</hi> I rather chuſe to retain the name of <hi>Arada,</hi> which it
receives in its native country.</p>
                  <p>It is not exactly an Anter; but we have placed it after
theſe, becauſe it has the ſame external characters, though it differs in
its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. It perches upon trees, and never alights on the ground, except to
pick up ants and other inſects, upon which it feeds. It is diſtinguiſhed
from them by a remarkable property; for all the Anters utter harſh cries
without any moleſtation, while the Arada has the moſt charming warble. It
commences often with the ſeven notes of the octave, and then whiſtles
different ſoft varied airs, which are lower than thoſe of the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale,
and more like the breathing of a ſweet toned flute; and it is ſaid to excel
even that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated choriſter of the grove in delicate tender 
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1084600104:429"/> melody. It has alſo a ſort of whiſtle,
reſembling that by which a perſon calls upon another: tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
frequently miſtake this ſound, and, by following it, they are led more
aſtray; for as they approach, the bird continually recedes, and whiſtles at
intervals.</p>
                  <p>The Arada avoids ſettled ſpots; it lives alone in the
depth of the vaſt foreſts, and the ſoftneſs of its melody ſeems in
ſome meaſure to relieve the gloomy ſtillneſs around. It is one of the
very few birds in the New World which Nature has diſtinguiſhed by the
charms of its ſong. But the ſpecies is not numerous; and the traveller may
frequently purſue his pathleſs journey without meeting a ſingle Arada to
ſooth his ſympathetic gloom.</p>
                  <p>The colours of its plumage correſpond not with the
richneſs of its ſong; they are dull and obſcure.—The total length
is four inches, and the tail is radiated tranſverſely with rufous, brown,
and blackiſh;—it exceeds the wings by ſeven lines.</p>
                  <p>To the Arada we may refer a bird which Mauduit ſhewed to us:
it reſembles that in the length and ſhape of its bill, the form of its
tail, the length of its legs, in having ſome white feathers mixed with the
brown ones on the ſides of the neck; the ſize is nearly equal, and the
ſhape ſimilar; but the tip of its bill is more hooked, its throat is white,
with a half-collar of black below, and its plumage is uniform, 
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1084600104:430"/> and not ſtriped with brown lines, as in the Arada,
whoſe throat and under-part of its neck are red. We may preſume therefore,
that this bird is either a diſtinct variety of the Arada, or a contiguous
ſpecies, ſince it inhabits Cayenne; though, being unacquainted with its
habits, we ſhall not at preſent preſume to decide the matter.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Turdus Gantans:—</hi>

               <p>TO avoid confuſion, we ſhall reſtore to this bird the name
of <hi>Agami,</hi> which it has ever received in its native region. In a
preceding part of the preſent work, we were deceived by the account of Father
Dutertre, and have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it by the appellation of <hi>Caracara;</hi> but
that term was beſtowed by Marcgrave upon a bird of prey totally different
from the <hi>Agami.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Naturaliſts have entertained the moſt oppoſite opinions
with regard to this bird. Dutertre ſuppoſes it to be a Pheaſant; Barrere
reckons it a Wild Hen; Pallas terms it a Crane; and Adanſon ſeems to
inſinuate that it is a large aquatic bird of the genus of the Lapwing,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its knees are prominent, and its hind-toe is placed a little higher
than the three fore-toes, and becauſe it appears the intermediate kind
between the <hi>Jacana</hi> and the <hi>Kamichi.</hi>

                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:1084600104:435"/> But the Agami is quite a diſtinct race.
It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles indeed the aquatic birds in the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which Adanſon has
properly remarked, and alſo the greeniſh colour of the legs; but its nature
is entirely different. It inhabits the arid mountains, and the upland
foreſts; and never viſits the fens, or the margins of water.—We have
here another example of the errors into which artificial ſyſtems lead.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a Pheaſant or Curaſſo; for not only are its legs
and thighs different, but its toes and nails are much ſhorter. Still more is
it widely ſeparated from the Common Hen; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ranged with the
Cranes, ſince its bill, its neck, and its neck, and its legs, are much
ſhorter than in the aquatic birds.</p>
               <p>The Agami is twenty-two inches long; its bill, which is exactly
like that of the gallinaceous tribe, is twenty-one lines; its tail is very
ſhort, not exceeding three inches and one-fourth, and is concealed by the
ſuperior coverts, and does not project beyond the wings; its legs are five
inches high, and completely covered with ſmall ſcales, as in the other
gallinaceous birds, and theſe ſcales reach two inches above the knees,
which are not feathered.</p>
               <p>The whole of its head, its throat, and the upper half of its
neck, both above and below, are covered with a ſhort down, which is very
cloſe, and feels very ſoft; the fore-part of the lower ſurface of the
neck, and the breaſt, are covered <pb n="392" facs="tcp:1084600104:436"/> with a beautiful
gorget four inches broad, whoſe brilliant colours vary between green, gold
green, blue, and violet; the upper-part of its back, and the contiguous portion
of its neck, are black; the plumage changes on the hind-part of the back into a
tawny-rufous; but all the under-ſide of the body is black, and alſo the
wings and the tail; only the great feathers which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the rump and the
tail, are light aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured; the legs are greeniſh.</p>
               <p>The nomenclators<note n="*" place="bottom">Barrère,
Briſſon, Voſmaër, &amp; &amp;c.</note> have alſo confounded the
Agami with the <hi>Macucagua</hi> of Marcgrave, which is the great

                     <p>The moſt characteriſtic and remarkable property of
theſe birds conſiſts in the wonderful noiſe which they often make,
either of themſelves; or when urged by the keepers of the <hi>menagerie.</hi>
I do not wonder that hitherto they have been ſuppoſed to form this through
the anus. It coſt me no little trouble to convince myſelf of the contrary.
To ſucceed, one muſt be on the ground, and with a bit of bread entice the
bird to come near; then make the noiſe, which the keepers can well imitate,
and often diſpoſe the Agami to repeat it. This equivocal noiſe is
ſometimes preceded by a ſavage cry, interrupted by a ſound approaching
that of <hi>ſcherck, ſcherck,</hi> to which ſucceeds the hollow
ſingular noiſe in queſtion, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles ſomewhat the moan of
pigeons. In this way it utters five, ſix, or ſeven times, with
precipitation, a hollow noiſe emitted from within its body, nearly as if one
pronounced <hi>tou, tou, tou, tou, tou, tou,</hi> with the mouth ſhut,
reſting upon the laſt <hi>teu . . .</hi> a very long time, and terminating
by ſinking gradually with the ſame note. This ſound alſo reſembles
much the lengthened doleful noiſe which the Dutch bakers make, by blowing a
glaſs trumpet, to inform their cuſtomers when the bread comes out of the
oven. This ſound, as I have already ſaid, iſſues not from the anus; yet
I am very confident, that it is formed by a ſlight opening of the bill, and
by a ſort of lungs peculiar to almoſt all birds, though of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
form. This is alſo the opinion of M. Pallas, who heard it often with me, and
to whom I gave one of the dead birds for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection." The doctor has
communicated to me his obſervations with reſpect to the internal
ſtructure of the animal, for which I am much obliged to him. 
<q rend="inline">"The wind-pipe," ſays he, "before its
entrance into the breaſt, is as thick as a large writing-pen, bony, and quite
cylindrical. In the breaſt it becomes cartilaginous, and divides into two
ſemi-circular canals, which paſs through the lungs, the left one being very
ſhort, but the right one reaching the bottom of the lower belly, and parted
by tranſverſe membranes into three or four lobes."</q>
                     </p> 
                     <p>Theſe lungs therefore are undoubtedly the inſtrument of
the various cries emitted by birds. The air preſſed by the impulſive
action of the fibres, ſeeks to eſcape through the large branches of the
fleſhy lungs, and meets with an obſtruction from the little elaſtic
membranes, which produces pulſations, the origin of all ſorts of ſounds 
<note n="†" place="bottom">Memoires de l'Academie des
Sciences, <hi>année</hi> 1753. p. 293.</note>. But, what above all
convinces us that this noiſe proceeds not from the anus, if a perſon
obſerves attentively when the bird makes it, he will perceive the breaſt
and belly to heave, and the bill to open ſomewhat.

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:1084600104:437"/> emitting a dull hollow ſound, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to come from the anus<note n="*" place="bottom">M. de la Condamine entertained

have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <pb n="394" facs="tcp:1084600104:438"/> that this is a miſtaken notion. We
ſhall only obſerve that in many birds, as well as in the Agami, the
windpipe is bony at its opening, and becomes cartilaginous in its deſcent,
and in general the cries of ſuch birds are deep; but there are alſo many
birds on the other hand whoſe windpipe is cartilaginous at its riſe, and
termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates bony in the breaſt, and theſe have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſhrill
notes.</p>
               <p>The odd ſort of noiſe which this bird makes, is probably
owing to the extent of lungs, and the capacity of their membranous cells. But
it is unneceſſary to ſuppoſe with Voſmaër, that the Agami is
obliged to open its bill a little in order to give paſſage to the ſound;
for any ſudden motion in the bowels is communicated through the muſcles and
teguments to the external air, which conveys the impulſe to the ear. We have
often occaſion to notice this circumſtance; and it appears to be prejudice
that the ſounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by animals are always tranſmitted through the
throat, or through the alimentary canal. Nor is this ſpecies of
ventriloquiſm peculiar to the Agami; the Curaſſo without opening its bill
makes a ſimilar hollow ſound, which is even more articulate and more
powerful. Indeed the ſame property ſeems to obtain, though in a leſs
degree, in many kinds of birds in which the lungs are proportionally larger
than in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds. The hoarſe murmur which the Turkey-cock makes before
his gobble, the cooing which <pb n="395" facs="tcp:1084600104:439"/> the Pigeon effects without
motion of the mouth, are of this nature; only in theſe the ſound riſes
near the bottom of the throat; but in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſo, and eſpecially in the
Hocco, it has its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin deeper.</p>
               <p>In regard to the manner in which the Agami lives in the
domeſtic ſtate, I ſhall quote the words of Voſmaër:— 
<q rend="inline">"When theſe birds are well kept, they are
attentive to cleanlineſs, and often peck the feathers of the body and wings
with their bill: if they frolic with each other, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all their
movements by hopping, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently flapping their wings. The change of food
and of climate certainly cools here (in Holland) their natural ardor for
propagation. Their ordinary ſubſiſtence is grain, ſuch as buck-wheat,
&amp;c. but they alſo eat readily ſmall fiſh, fleſh, and bread. This
fondneſs for fiſh, and the uncommon length of their legs, ſhew that they
partake of the nature of the Herons and Cranes, and that they belong to the
claſs of the aquatic birds."</q> We muſt obſerve here that the
fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for fiſh is no proof, ſince poultry are as greedy of this
ſort of food as of any other. 
<q rend="inline">"What <hi>Piſtorius</hi> relates," continues
Voſmaër, "with reſpect to the gratitude of this bird, may put many to
the bluſh. When tamed, it diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes its maſter and benefactor with
marks of its affection. Having reared one, I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of
experiencing this myſelf: when I opened its cage in the morning, the kind
ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <pb n="396" facs="tcp:1084600104:440"/> hopped round me, expanding both his wings, and
<hi>trumpeting</hi> (this is the term which we may employ to expreſs the
noiſe) from his bill, and behind, as if he wiſhed me good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. He
ſhewed no leſs attention when I went out and returned again; no ſooner
did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me from a diſtance than he ran to meet me: and even when I
happened to be in a boat, and ſet my foot on ſhore, he welcomed me with the
ſame compliments, which he reſerved for me alone, and never beſtowed them
upon others."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall ſubjoin a number of additional facts, which were
communicated by M. de Manon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</p>
               <p>In the ſtate of nature the Agami inhabits the vaſt foreſts
in the warm climates of America, and never viſits the cleared grounds,
ſtill leſs the ſettled ſpots. It aſſociates in numerous flocks, and
prefers not the ſwamps and ſides of lakes; for it is often found on the
mountains, and in hilly ſituations. It walks and runs rather than flies,
ſince it never riſes more than a few feet, and only to reach ſome ſhort
diſtance, or to gain ſome low branch. It feeds upon wild fruits, like the
Curaſſos, the Marails, and other gallinaceous birds. When ſurpriſed in
its haunts, it makes its eſcape by ſwiftneſs of feet, ſeldom uſing
its wings, and at the ſame time emits a ſhrill cry like that of the
Turkey.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds ſcrape the earth at the roots of the large trees
to form a bed for their eggs; and <pb n="397" facs="tcp:1084600104:441"/> employ no lining, and
conſtruct no neſt. They lay many eggs, from ten to ſixteen; but the
number is proportioned, as in all other birds, to the age of the female; they
are almoſt ſpherical, larger than hens eggs, and tinged with light green.
The young Agamis retain their down, or rather their firſt diſhevelled
feathers, much longer than our chickens, or infant-partridges: theſe are
ſometimes near two inches long, and before a certain age they might paſs
for animals covered with ſilky hairs, which are cloſe like fur, and feel
ſoft; the true feathers appear not till they have attained the fourth of
their full growth.</p>
               <p>The Agami is not only tamed eaſily, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes attached to
its benefactor with all the fondneſs and fidelity of dogs; and of this
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſhews the moſt unequivocal proofs. When bred up in the
houſe, it loads its maſter with careſſes, and follows his motions; and
if it conceives a diſlike to perſons on account of their forbidding figure,
their offenſive ſmell, or of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries received, it will purſue them
ſometimes to a conſiderable diſtance, biting their legs, and
teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying every mark of diſpleaſure. It obeys the voice of its
maſter, and even anſwers to the call of all thoſe to whom it bears no
grudge. It is fond of careſſes, and offers its head and neck to be
ſtroked; and if once accuſtomed to theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities, it becomes
troubleſome, and will not be ſatisfied without continual fondling. It makes
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:1084600104:442"/> its appearance as often as its maſter ſits down to
table, and begins with driving out the dogs and cats, and taking
poſſeſſion of the room: for it is ſo obſtinate and bold, that it
never yields, and often after a tough battle, can put a middle-ſized dog to
flight. It avoids the bites of its anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt by riſing in the air, and
retaliates with violent blows with its bill and nails, aimed chiefly at the
eyes; and after it gains the ſuperiority, it purſues the victory with the
utmoſt rancour, and, if not parted, will deſtroy the fugitive. By its
intercourſe with man, its inſtincts became moulded like thoſe of dogs;
and we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the Agamis can be trained to tend a flock of ſheep.
It even ſhews a degree of jealouſy of its rivals; for when at table it
bites fiercely the naked legs of the negroes, and other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, who come
near its maſter.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of theſe birds, eſpecially when they are young,
is not ill-flavoured, but is dry, and commonly hard. The rich brilliant part of
the plumage which covers the breaſt, is ſeparated from the reſt, and
prepared for the ornaments of dreſs.</p>
               <p>M. De la Borde has alſo communicated the following particulars
in regard to this bird. 
<q rend="inline">"The wild Agamis," ſays he, "are diſperſed
in the back country, and are no longer found in the neighbourhood of Cayenne .
. . and they are very common in the remote unſettled tracts. . . . They are
always found in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe <pb n="399" facs="tcp:1084600104:443"/> foreſts, in flocks from
ten and twelve to forty. . . . They fly from the ground to the low trees, where
they remain ſtill, and in ſuch ſituation the hunters often kill ſeveral
without ſcaring away the reſt. . . . Some perſons imitate their hoarſe
murmur ſo exactly, as to decoy them to their feet. . . . When the hunters
diſcover a flock of Agamis, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not till they have killed
ſeveral: theſe birds ſeldom or never fly, and their fleſh is but
ordinary, black, and always hard; however, that of the young ones is more
palatable. . . . No bird is ſo eaſily tamed as this, and there are always
many of them in the ſtreets of Cayenne. . . . They even roam out of town, but
return in due time to their maſter. . . . They allow one to come near them,
and handle them at pleaſure; they are afraid neither of dogs, nor of birds of
prey, in the court-yard; they aſſume the aſcendency over the poultry, and
keep them in great ſubjection: they feed like the hens, the <hi>Marils,</hi>
and the <hi>Paraguas;</hi> but when very young, they prefer ſmall worms and
fleſh to every thing elſe.</q>

               <p>As the habits and oeconomy of this bird were little known, I
have thought proper to tranſcribe the different accounts which I have
received. It appears that of all the feathered tribes, the Agami is the moſt
attached to the ſociety of man; and in this reſpect it is as eminently
diſtinguiſhed above them all, as the dog is above the other quadrupeds. The
diſpoſition of the Agami is the more remarkable, ſince it is the only
bird that has a ſocial turn; whereas ſeveral of the quadrupeds diſcover
attachment to man, though inferior in degree to that of the dog. And is it not
ſtrange, that an animal, ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly formed for ſociety, has never
been do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticated? Nothing can better ſhew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe diſtance
between the civilized man and the rude ſavage, than the dominion obtained
over the lower creation. The former has made the dog, the horſe, the ox, the
camel, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, the rein-deer, &amp;c. ſubſervient to his utility, or
his pleaſure: he has drawn together <pb n="401" facs="tcp:1084600104:445"/> the hens, the
geeſe, the turkies, and the ducks, and has lodged the pigeons. The ſavage
has overlooked advantages the moſt obvious and the moſt eſſential to
his comfort. It is ſociety that gives ſpring to activity; that awakens the
dormant faculties; and that expands, informs, and enlivens the whole!<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Gold-breaſted Trumpeter:—

               <p>THESE birds, which are peculiar to the warm parts of America,
may be regarded as a part of the gallinaceous claſs; for they reſemble the
Buſtard and Partridge, though they differ in ſeveral properties. But there
are certain habits in animals which reſult from the nature of the climate,
and from local circumſtances, and which ought not to be deemed eſſential
characters.—Thus many birds, ſuch as Partridges, which remain
conſtantly on the ground in Europe, perch in America; and even the palmated
aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fowls, paſs the day in the water, and return to lodge during the
night among the trees. The dangers with which they are ſurrounded appear to
drive them to ſuch retreats. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſwarms of inſects and
reptiles, engendered by the heat and the moiſture of the climate, threaten
every moment their deſtruction. If they ventured to repoſe upon the ground,
the denſe columns of ants would attack them in their ſlumbers, and reduce
them to ſkeletons. The Quails are the only birds in thoſe countries which
reſt upon the ſurface; and they often fall a prey to the voracity of the
ſerpents. Nor is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, <pb n="403" facs="tcp:1084600104:447"/> that the Quails have
been introduced ſince the diſcovery of America, and that they have not yet
acquired the habits ſuited to their new ſituation, or learned to guard
againſt the aſſaults of their numerous foes.</p>
               <p>We ſhould have ranged the genus of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namous</hi>
after that of the Buſtard; but theſe birds were, at that time, but
imperfectly known, and we are indebted to M. de Manoncour for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
facts relating to their hiſtory, and alſo for the ſpecimens preſented
to the Royal Cabinet, from which we have made the deſcriptions.</p>

                  </note>, and the French ſettlers at Cayenne,
have both termed theſe birds <hi>Partridges;</hi> and the appellation has
been adopted by ſome nomenclators<note n="†" place="bottom">Briſſon.—Barrere.</note>, though altogether improper:
for the <hi>Tinamous</hi> are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their long ſlender bill,
blunt at the tip, black above, and whitiſh below; their noſtrils oblong,
and placed near the middle of their bill; their hind-toe is very ſhort, and
does not reſt upon the ground; their nails are very ſhort, broad, and
channelled beneath; their legs alſo differ from thoſe of Partridges, being
covered behind, as in the poultry, with ſcales, their whole length, ſhaped
like ſmall ſhells; but the upper-part projects and forms inequalities not
obſerved on the legs of poultry. In all the Tinamous, <pb n="404" facs="tcp:1084600104:448"/>
the throat and craw are thinly ſtrewed with ſtraggling feathers; the quills
of the tail are ſo ſhort, that in ſome they are wholly concealed by the
ſuperior coverts.—Thus they are improperly named Partridges, ſince
they differ in ſo many eſſential characters.</p>
               <p>But they differ alſo from the Buſtard, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of
their principal characters, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by having a fourth toe behind,
which is wanting in the Buſtard. In ſhort, we have judged it requiſite to
range them in a ſeparate genus, under the name which they receive in their
native country.</p>
               <p>All the ſpecies of the Tinamous paſs the night upon the
trees, and ſometimes perch during the day; but they always ſettle among the
loweſt branches, and never mount to the ſummits: and this circumſtance
ſeems to imply the probability that they are not actuated by original
impulſe, but directed by conſiderations of ſafety.</p>
               <p>The Tinamous are, in general, excellent for the table; their
fleſh is white, firm, cloſe, and juicy, eſpecially about the wings, and
taſtes like that of the Red Partridge. The thighs and rump have commonly a
diſagreeable bitterneſs, which is occaſioned by the fruit of the Indian
reed upon which they feed. The ſame bitter taſte is obſerved in the
Ring-Pigeons which eat theſe fruits. But when the Tinamous live upon other
fruits, ſuch as wild cherries, &amp;c. their fleſh is uniformly delicate,
but ſtill has none <pb n="405" facs="tcp:1084600104:449"/> of the <hi>fumet.</hi> In the
ſultry humid climate of Cayenne, meat will not keep more than twenty-four
hours from putrefaction, and no ſort of game can be allowed time to mellow
and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that delicious flavour which conſtitutes its excellence. Theſe
birds, like all thoſe which have a craw, often ſwallow the fruits without
bruiſing or even cracking them; they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly fond of the wild
cherries, and alſo of the produce of the <hi>common palm,</hi> and even of
that of the coffee-ſhrub, when they can find it. Nor do they cull their
ſubſiſtence from the trees; they only collect the fruits which have
dropped. They ſcrape the ground to form their neſt, which is uſually
nothing but a ſingle layer of dry herbs. They lay twice a-year, and have
numerous broods; which ſhews that theſe birds and the Agamis are of the
gallinaceous claſs, which is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably prolific. Like theſe alſo, they
fly heavily, and to ſhort diſtances, but run ſwiftly on the ground; they
form little flocks, and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common to find them either ſingle or in
pairs; they call each other in all ſeaſons; in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening,
and ſometimes too during the day: this call is a ſlow, quavering, plaintive
whiſtle, which the fowlers imitate to bring them near; for this game is the
moſt common and the beſt which that country affords.</p>
               <p>We ſhall add a remarkable circumſtance with reſpect to
theſe genus of birds, that, as in the Anters, the female is larger than the
male; a <pb n="406" facs="tcp:1084600104:450"/> property which in Europe is found only in the
rapacious tribe. In the ſhape of the body, however, and in the diſtribution
of the colours, the females are almoſt entirely like the males.</p>

which was given by the natives of the country. It is the ſmalleſt of the
genus, not exceeding eight or nine inches in length, and not being larger than
a Partridge. Its fleſh is as delicate as that of the other kinds, but it lays
only five or ſix eggs, and ſometimes no more than three or four, which are
rather larger than Pigeons eggs; they are almoſt ſpherical, and as white as
thoſe of hens. The Little Tina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous do not form their neſt like the Great
Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namous, by ſcraping the ground; they build it with long narrow leaves on
the loweſt branches of ſhrubs: it is hemiſpherical, about ſix inches in
diameter, and five inches high. Of all the four ſpecies, this is the only one
which does not live conſtantly in the woods; it often frequents the young
ſtraggling trees and buſhes, which ſhoot up in land that has been

               <p>NATURE has aſſigned theſe a place after the humbleſt of
the rapacious tribes. They are harmleſs and even uſeful; they conſume not
fruits, but live upon flies, gnats, and other winged inſects. The genus
comprehends nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſpecies, which vary exceedingly in point of ſize,
from that of the Nightingale to that of the Shrike. Some characters however are
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all: their bill is compreſſed, broad at the baſe, and
almoſt triangular, beſet with briſtles, and the tip bent into a little
hook in many of the middle ſpecies and more curved in all the large
ſpecies; the tail is of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length, and only half covered by the
wings. Their bill is alſo ſcalloped near the point; a property which they
ſhare with the Blackbird, the Thruſh, and ſome other birds.</p>
               <p>Their diſpoſition is in general ſhy and ſolitary, and
their notes are neither lively nor melodious. Subſiſting in the region of
air, they ſeldom leave the ſummits of the lofty mountains, and are rarely
ſeen on the ground. Their habit of cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the branches would ſeem to
have increaſed <pb n="415" facs="tcp:1084600104:460"/> the growth of their hind-toe, which in
moſt of the Flycatchers is longer than the fore-toe.</p>
               <p>The ſultry tropical countries, which teem with various
inſects, are the favourite abodes of theſe birds<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <q rend="inline">"The Flycatchers are in general common birds
in hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The ſpecies are there more frequent and more numerous than
in temperate countries; and few occur in cold climates. They feed only upon
inſects. They are deſtructive creatures, which, in the hot and moiſt
regions, Nature has oppoſed to the exceſſive fecundity of the inſects."

America, which are alſo the largeſt ſpecies; and as in the New World the
inſect nations are the moſt numerous and the moſt formidable, ſo Nature
has provided a ſtronger body to prey upon them.—We ſhall range them
according to their ſize into three diviſions: the firſt are ſmaller

                  <p>This ſpecies being well known, will ſerve as a term of
compariſon.—It is five inches eight lines in length; its alar extent
eight inches and a half; the wings, when cloſed, reach to the middle of its
tail, which is two inches long; its bill is flat, broad at its baſe, and
eight lines long, beſet with briſtles: its whole plumage conſiſts of
theſe three colours, gray, white, and blackiſh cinereous; its throat is
white; its breaſt and the ſides of its neck are ſpotted with faint
ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined brown; the reſt of the under-part of its body is whitiſh; the
upper-part of its head ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears variegated with gray and brown; all the
higher-part of its body, its tail, and its wings, are brown; the quills and
their coverts are lightly fringed with whitiſh.</p>
                  <p>The ſpotted Flycatchers arrive in April, and depart in
September. They live generally in the foreſts, and prefer the folitude of the
cloſe ſhady ſpots; and ſometimes they are found in the <pb facs="tcp:1084600104:462"/>

melancholy air; their diſpoſition is wild, inanimate, and even ſtupid:
they place their neſt, entirely expoſed, either on the trees or the
buſhes. No ſmall bird is ſo incautious, and none has inſtincts ſo
unſettled. The neſts are not of an uniform conſtruction; ſome
conſiſt entirely of moſs, and others have a mixture of wool. They
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume much time and labour upon the rude ſtructure, and ſometimes we
find it interwoven with thick roots, and are ſurprized that ſo ſmall an
artificer could employ ſuch materials. They lay three or four eggs,
ſometimes five, which are covered with rufous ſpots.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds procure the principal part of their
ſubſiſtence while on the wing, but ſeldom alight, and then only by
ſtarts, upon the ground, and never run along it. The male is not different
from the female, except that its face is more varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with brown, and its
belly is not ſo white. They appear in France in the ſpring, but the cold
weather which ſometimes prevails in the middle of that ſeaſon is
pernicious to them. Lottinger ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that they almoſt all periſhed in
the ſnows which fell in Lorraine in April 1767 and 1772, and that they were
caught by the hand. Every degree of cold that deſtroys the inſects, their
only ſupport, muſt prove fatal to them; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they leave our
provinces before the froſt ſets in, and they are never ſeen after the end
of September. Aldrovandus ſays, that they <pb n="418" facs="tcp:1084600104:464"/> do not
migrate; but this muſt be underſtood in regard to Italy, or of ſtill
warmer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Spotted

                  <p>It appears to be better known in Lorraine, and more common
than in other parts. It is rather ſmaller than the preceding, being
ſcarcely five inches long; it has no other colours than white and black,
which are diſperſed in diſtinct ſpots; but its plumage
notwithſtanding varies more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably than that of any other bird.</p>

                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:1084600104:465"/> The male appears to have four different
garbs, according to the ſeaſons. The firſt is that of the autumn, or
winter, when the plumage is the ſame with that of the female, which is not
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch changes. The ſecond is worn when theſe birds arrive in
Provence or Italy, and is then exactly like that of the Epicurean Warbler. The
third is what they aſſume ſhortly after their appearance, and may be
termed the ſpring attire<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                        <q rend="inline">"I fed one this ſpring three or four days.

                        </q>
                     </note>. This is only the intermediate gradation to the fourth
ſtate, which is that of ſummer, and which, as Lottinger obſerves, may be
properly termed its <hi>marriage ſuit,</hi> becauſe it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes this at
pairing, and lays it aſide after the breeding is over. The bird is then in
its full beauty: a white collar three lines broad encircles its neck, which is
of the fineſt black; its head is of the ſame colour, except the front and
the face, which are bright white; its back and its tail are ſtained with the
black of the head; its rump is variegated with black and white; a white
ſtreak of a line in breadth borders for ſome way the outermoſt quills of
the tail; the wings, conſiſting of ſeventeen quills, are of a deep
cheſnut; the third and the four fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are tipt with a much lighter
brown, which, when the wings are cloſed, has a very fine effect: all the
quills, the two firſt excepted, <pb n="420" facs="tcp:1084600104:466"/> have a white ſpot on
the outer edge, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges the nearer it is to the body; ſo that the
outer-edge of the laſt quill is entirely white; the throat, the breaſt, and
the belly are white; the bill and the legs black. There is a remarkable
luſtre and gloſs ſpread over the whole of the plumage; but theſe
beauties are gone before the beginning of July. The colours grow dilute and
duſky; the collar firſt diſappears, and the reſt ſoon becomes
ſtained and obſcure, and the male is no longer diſtinguiſhable from the
female. 
<q rend="inline">"I have frequently met with bird-catchers,"
ſays Lottinger, "who ſpread the nets on the ſprings in places where they
breed; and though it was only in July, they told me that they caught numbers of
females, but not a ſingle male;"</q> ſo entirely was the external
diſtinction of ſex obliterated. That naturaliſt has not deſcribed ſo
fully the vernal plumage with which they enter into the ſouthern provinces.
However, Aldrovandus ſeems to indicate the change of this Flycatcher, which
he has well deſcribed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place<note n="*" place="bottom">He
deſcribes its collar, the white ſpot on its wing: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends its beauty.
It is known, he ſays, by the fowlers of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna, under the name of
<hi>Peglia-Moſehe.</hi>
                     </note>, when, ranging it again with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cafigos,
he tells us of his having ſurprized it at the very inſtant of its
transformation, being then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Epicurean Warbler,</hi> nor a
<hi>Black-Cap.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, he ſubjoins, the collar was become white; there
was a white ſpot on the front; <pb n="421" facs="tcp:1084600104:467"/> white on the tail and
the wings; the under-part of the body white, and the reſt black. Theſe
properties ſufficiently diſcriminate the Collared Black Flycatcher.</p>
                  <p>This bird arrives in Lorraine about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of April. It
lives in the foreſts, thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which conſiſt of tall trees,
and breeds in the holes of the trunks, ſometimes pretty deep, and at a
conſiderable height above the ſurface of the ground. Its neſt is formed
of ſmall ſtalks of graſs, and a little moſs, which covers the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the cavity. It lays ſix eggs. After the young are hatched, the parents
frequently go in and out, carrying ſupplies of food; and this care of their
infant brood often betrays the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, which would otherwiſe be difficult
to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
                  <p>They ſubſiſt only upon flies, and other wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inſects. They are never ſeen on the ground; and for the moſt part they
keep very high, flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering from tree to tree. They have no ſong, but only an
exceeding ſhrill plaintive accent, which turns upon the ſharp note
<hi>crrî, crrî.</hi> They appear ſad and gloomy; but their
attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their offspring inſpires activity, and even courage.</p>
                  <p>Lorraine is not the only province in France where the Collared
Black Flycatcher is found. Hebert has informed us, that one was ſeen in Brie,
but where it is little known, becauſe it is wild and tranſitory. We
ourſelves found one <pb n="422" facs="tcp:1084600104:468"/> of theſe Flycatchers on the
tenth of May 1773, in a ſmall park near Montbard in Burgundy; and it was in
the ſame ſtate of plumage as that deſcribed by Briſſon. Of the great
coverts, which he ſays are tipt with white, thoſe only which were next the
body were ſuch, and the more remote were brown; the inferior coverts alone of
the tail were white, the ſuperior ones were blackiſh-brown; the rump was
dull pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray; the nape of the neck where the collar was ſituated, was
lighter than the head and the back; the middle quills of the wings were near
the tip of the ſame brown as the great quills; the tongue appears to be
indented at the tip, broad for the ſize of the bird, but proportioned to the
breadth of the bottom of the bill; the inteſtinal tube was eight or nine
inches long; the gizzard muſcular, preceded by a dilatation of the
<hi>oeſophagus;</hi> there were ſome marks of a <hi>coecum;</hi> and no
gall-bladder. The bird was a male, and the teſticles ſeemed to be a line in
diameter; it weighed three gros.</p>
                  <p>In this ſpecies of Flycatchers, the ends of the wings meet,
and ſtretch beyond the middle of the tail; which is the reverſe of what
generally takes place in the genus.—There are ſeveral inaccuracies in
the figures given of it in the <hi>Planches Enluminées.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This penſive bird enjoys a quiet peaceful life, protected by
ſolitude. It avoids the cold ſeaſon, and ſhifts the ſcene to the
genial climes of the <pb n="423" facs="tcp:1084600104:469"/> ſouth, there to renew its loves.

the firſt, the head is blackiſh-brown, and the wings ruſty-brown; the
reſt of the plumage is a mixture of whitiſh and of a brown, like that of
the head and wings, diſpoſed in ſmall waves, or ſmall ſpots, without

toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they are of the ſame ſize, and are natives of the ſame

line which paſſes upon the eye, and encircles the head with a ſort of
little diadem, is not ſo entire or diſtinct in any other of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. The
firſt is the ſmaller, being only three inches and a half long; a rufous
ſpot covers the top of the head, which is ſurrounded by the

marks the breaſt; the back is light-gray, ſpread upon white; the tail and
the wings are blackiſh. A white line extends obliquely on their middle
coverts, and the ſame coverts are edged with ſcales of the rufous colour of
the breaſt. A gloſſy tranſparency is ſpread over all the plumage of
this bird; ſtill lighter and more vivid on that of the other, which is
ſimpler in its colours, conſiſting of a mixture of light gray, of white,
and of black, and is not inferior in point of beauty; the white bar paſſes
upon the eyes; a horſe-ſhoe of the ſame colour riſes pointed under the
bill, and is cut ſquare on the breaſt, which is diſtinguiſhed by a
black belt; the top of the neck is black, which mingling with the white of the

                  <p>We ſhall conſider the Creſted Flycatcher of the iſland
of Bourbon as only a variety of the Creſted Flycatcher of Senegal, and both
as forming one ſpecies. The iſland of Bourbon, placed in the midſt of a
vaſt ocean, and ſituated between the tropics, enjoys an uniform
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, which requires not periodical migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when firſt
viſited by the European ſhips contained no land bird. Thoſe found in it
at preſent have been carried thither by chance or deſign; nor muſt it be
regarded as the native ſeat of original ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">We
find alſo two Flycatchers of the iſle of Bourbon, which we ſhall barely
mention, convinced that they belong to ſome ſpecies on the continent of
Africa. The one is repreſented in the <hi>Illumined Plates,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 572,
Fig. 3; it is ſmall, and quite black, except a little rufous which it has
under its tail; and, notwithſtanding the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of colour, we may
ſuppoſe it to be a variety of the Cape Flycatchers, which we have already
referred to our Collared Black Flycatcher: theſe differences of plumage being
apparently no other than what we ſee it undergo itſelf, and which the
influence of a hotter climate muſt render more extenſive and rapid,
eſpecially as it is naturally diſpoſed to change. M. Briſſon
indicates in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing terms the third Flycatcher of the iſle of
Bourbon, to which he ſays the inhabitants give the name of
<hi>Tecteo:—</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Flycatcher, above brown; the edges of the
quills tawny; below tawny; <hi>(male).</hi> Dirty white; the tail-quills deep
brown; their outer edges light brown; <hi>(female).</hi>"</q>
                     </note>: we
ſhall therefore claſs <pb n="427" facs="tcp:1084600104:473"/> the bird diſcovered on the
iſland with its analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous one of the continent. In fact, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
between them are not greater than thoſe which often occur among individuals
of this genus; their figure, their bulk, and their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal colours, are the
ſame; in both the head is furniſhed with ſmall feathers, half-raiſed
into a black creſt, with green and violet reflections; this black deſcends
in the Senegal Flycatcher like a ſquare ſpot upon the breaſt, and the
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the neck. In that of Bourbon, the black covers only the head, with
the eye, and alſo the lower-mandible; but, in other ſubjects, it is
ſpread alſo upon the top of the neck. In both the under-part of the body is
of a fine light ſlate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray, and the upper-ſide bay, which is more vivid in
that of Bourbon, and deeper and cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut in that of Senegal; and this colour,
which extends equally over the whole of the tail and wings of the laſt, is
interſected by a little white in the other, and aſſumes a deeper caſt
on the coverts, which are alſo fringed with three lighter ſtreaks. The
blackiſh colour of the quills has only a light ruſty border on the
outſide, and whitiſh on the inſide of the webs. The greateſt difference
occurs in the tail; that of the Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon Flycatcher is ſhort and ſquare,
being only two inches and a half long; the tail of the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Flycatcher is
more than four inches, and is tapered from the two middle quills, which are the
longeſt, to the outer ones, which are two <pb n="428" facs="tcp:1084600104:474"/> inches
ſhorter. This difference may be imputed to the effect of age, ſeaſon, or
of ſex: at any rate, the claſſing of them together will excite a fuller
inveſtigation, and an attention to the points of diſerimination.</p>

                  <p>In all the Flycatchers the bill is beſet with briſtles;
but, in the preſent, theſe are ſo long that they reach to the tip, which
is the reaſon of its epithet <hi>whiſkered.</hi> It is near five inches

length; the upper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible projects a little beyond the lower, all the
upper-ſide of the body is deep olive-brown, except the top of the head, which
is covered by orange feathers, partly concealed by the other feathers; the

fine yellow.</p>
                  <p>The female is ſomewhat larger than the male; all the

greeniſh, not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous as in the male; the yellow of the top of
the head forms only an oblong ſpot, which is partly hid by the feathers of
the general colour; the throat and the top of the neck are whitiſh; the
feathers of the reſt of the neck, of the breaſt, and of the under-ſurface
of the wings, have their middle brown and the reſt yellowiſh; 
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:1084600104:477"/> the belly and the under-ſurface of the tail are

                  <p>The notes of the Whiſkered Flycatcher are not ſharp; it
whiſtles gently the ſound <hi>pipi;</hi> the male and female generally keep
together. The incautious manner in which the Flycatchers place their neſt is
remarkable in this ſpecies; it does not ſeek the leafy boughs, but builds
on the moſt naked and expoſed branches. The neſt is the more eaſily
detected, as it is exceedingly large, being twelve inches high, and more than
five in diameter, and entirely compoſed of moſs; it is cloſed above, and
has a narrow aperture in the ſide, three inches from the top. We owe our

                  <p>We thus mark the two conſpicuous colours of the plumage of
this bird, to which naturaliſts have hitherto given only the vague
appellation of American Flycatcher. It is hardly ſo large as the Yellow Wren.
A bright black is ſpread over the head, the throat, the back, and the
coverts; a beautiful yellow aurora is pencilled on the white gray of the
ſtomach, and deepens under the wings; it alſo appears in ſtreaks between
the quills of the wings, and covers two-thirds of thoſe of the tail, both
which are tipped with black, or blackiſh.—Such are the colours of the
male. In the female the black is dilute blackiſh, and the orange and
bluſh-colour yellow. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gives figures of both male and female. 
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:1084600104:488"/> Cateſby repreſents the bird alſo under the name of

                  <p>Of all the numerous family of Flycatchers this is the moſt
brilliant. Its ſlender delicate ſhape ſuits the luſtre of its garb: a
creſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſmall divided feathers of fine crimſon,
projects in rays on its head; the ſame colour appears under its bill, covers
its throat, breaſt, belly, and reaches the coverts of its tail; an
aſh-brown, interſected by ſome whitiſh waves on the edge of the
coverts, and even of the quills, covers all the upper-part of the body and
wings; the bill is very flat, and ſeven lines long; the tail two inches, and
exceeds the wings by ten lines; the whole length of the bird is five inches and
a half. Commerſon calls it <hi>Cardinal Titmouſe,</hi> though it is neither

nearly of the ſize of the Nightingale; all the upper-part of its body is of a
fine light rufous, with a flame caſt, which extends over the ſmall quills
of the wings, and theſe covering the great quills when the wings are
cloſed, have only a ſmall black triangle formed by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; a
brown ſpot covers the crown of the head; all the anterior and the upper-parts

<hi>Planches Enluminécs</hi> was brought from Cayenne; we have received
another from St. Domingo, under the name of <hi>Creſted Flycatcher of St.
Domingo.</hi> We are of opinion that theſe differ only by their ſex: that
of St. Domingo ſeems to be the male; for the golden yellow of its crown is
more vivid and more ſpread than in the other, where the lighter tint ſcarce
appears through the blackiſh feathers which cover that part of the head. In
other reſpects the two birds are ſimilar. They are rather ſmaller than
the Nightingale, being five inches and eight lines long; the bill is eight
lines, and ſcarcely curved at the tip, and the wings reach not to the middle;
the orange ſpot on the head is edged with a blackiſh aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, a white
bar croſſes the face over the eyes, below which a ſpot of the ſame
colour appears that ſpreads, and is loſt in the ruſty-brown of the back;
this ruſty-brown covers the wings and the tail, and becomes rather more
dilute on the edge of the ſmall webs of the quills; a fine orange-yellow
covers the breaſt and the belly, which vivid colour diſtinguiſhes this
bird from all the other Flycatchers. Though the golden yellow feathers of the
crown can be erected at pleaſure, as in the ſmall European Wrens, yet,
ſince they are uſually reclined, the bird is not properly <hi>a Creſted

of a bright bay co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and terminated with a little black ſpangle; ſo
that it might be taken for a peacock's tail in miniature.</p>
                  <p>This bird is alſo remarkably ſhaped, and ſeems to
combine the features of the Flycatchers, of the <hi>Moucherolles,</hi> and of
the Tyrants. It is ſcarcely larger than the European Flycatcher, and has a
diſproportioned bill, which is ten lines in length, and very broad and flat,
beſet with briſtles that reach almoſt to its tip, which is hooked. The
<hi>tarſus</hi> is ſhort; the toes ſlender; the wing is not more than
three inches, nor the tail more than two. It has a ſmall white eye-brow; its
throat is yellow; a blackiſh collar encircles its neck, and joins that tinge
which covers the back, and changes on the wing into a deep fulvous brown. The
quills of the tail are light bay; and the ſame colour, though more dilute,
ſtains the rump and the belly; the whitiſh colour of the ſtomach is 
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:1084600104:493"/> croſſed by ſmall blackiſh waves.—This bird
is very rare; only one ſpecimen has been brought from Cayenne, where even it
ſeldom appears.</p>

                  <p>The uſeful deſtination of the Flycatchers will occur to
the moſt ſuperficial obſerver. The inſect tribes elude the interference
of man; and though deſpicable as individuals, they often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formidable
by their numbers. Inſtances are recorded of their multiplying to ſuch an
amazing degree as to darken the air; of their devouring the whole vegetable
productions; and of their carrying in their train the accumulated ills of
famine and peſtilence. Happily for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſuch calamities are rare, and
Nature has wiſely provided the proper remedies. Moſt birds ſearch for
inſects' eggs; many feed on their groveling <hi>larvae;</hi> ſome live upon
their cruſtaceous cryſalids; and the Flycatchers ſeize them after they
eſcape from priſon, exulting on their wings. Hence in autumn, when theſe
birds migrate into other climates, the ſwarms of <pb n="449" facs="tcp:1084600104:495"/>
gnats, flies, and beetles, are in our latitudes more than uſually numerous.
But in the tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal countries, where heat and moiſture conſpire to ripen
the exuberance of inſect life, the Fly-catchers are more eſſential. All
Nature is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, and the circle of generation and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is
perpetual! The philoſopher contemplates with tender melancholy this cruel
ſyſtem of war; he ſtrives in vain to reconcile it with his ideas of
benevolence of intention: but he is forcibly ſtruck with the nice
adjuſtment of the various parts, their mutual connexion and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the unity of plan which pervades the whole.</p>

figured in the <hi>Planche Enlumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nées,</hi> under the appellation of
<hi>Forked-tail Tyrant of Cayenne;</hi> it is diſtinguiſhed however by its
bill, which is more ſlender and not ſo much hooked as in the Tyrants. It is
called <hi>the Widow</hi> at Cayenne; but this name is appropriated to another
kind of birds, which it reſembles in nothing except the length of its tail.
It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly haunts the flooded ſavannas, and for that reaſon we have
termed it the <hi>Savana.</hi> It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to perch upon the adjacent
trees, and to alight every minute upon the clods or graſſy tufts which
riſe above the ſurface of the water, jerking its tail like the Wagtails. It
is as large as the Creſted Lark; the quills of its tail are black, the two
outermoſt nine inches long, and forked, the two following only three inches
and a half, and the reſt gradually ſhorter, ſo that the two mid-ones are
only an inch:—and thus, though the bird is fourteen inches long,

the crown of its head is a yellow ſpot, which is however wanting in many
ſubjects, theſe being probably females. A ſhort blackiſh ſquare hood
covers the back of its head; beyond that, the plumage is white, which colour
advances under the bill, and ſpreads over all the anterior and under-part of
the body; the back is greeniſh-gray, and the wing brown.—This bird is

<hi>Schet-all,</hi> and <hi>Schet-Vouloulou,</hi> which ſeem to denote the

differences in the colours are not ſufficient to conſtitute diſtinct
ſpecies, where the ſhape, the ſize, and all the other proportions, are
the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Schets have the long form of the Wag-tail; they are rather
larger, meaſuring ſix inches and a half to the end of the true tail, not to
mention two feathers which extend almoſt five inches farther; the bill is
ſeven lines, triangular, very flat, broad at the baſe, beſet with
briſtles at the corners, and with hardly any perceptible curve at the point:
a beautiful black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh-green creſt, with the luſtre of burniſhed
ſteel, is bent ſmooth back, and covers the head; the iris is yellow, and
the eye-lid blue.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt variety, the ſame dark colour that paints the
creſt, encircles the neck, and inveſts the back, the great quills of the
wings and of the tail, of which the two long feathers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſeven
inches, and are white, as are alſo the ſmall quills of the wings, and all
the under-part of the body.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Schet-all,</hi> the colour of the creſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
only on the great quills of the wings, whoſe coverts are marked with broad
white lines; all the reſt of the plumage is a bright gilded bay, which
Edwards terms a <hi>fine ſhining cinnamon,</hi> which is ſpread equally
over the tail and the two long projecting ſhafts; theſe ſhafts are
ſimilar to thoſe which are ſent off from the tail in the Angola and
Abyſſinian Rollers, only <pb n="461" facs="tcp:1084600104:508"/> in theſe birds they are
the outermoſt, while in the Madagaſcar Moucherolle they occupy the
middle.</p>
                  <p>The third variety, or the <hi>Schet-Vouloulou,</hi> has
ſcarcely any difference from the preceding, except that the two projecting
feathers of the tail are whitiſh; the reſt of the plumage is bay-coloured,
as in the <hi>Schet-all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Schet-all</hi> which is preſerved in the King's
Cabinet, theſe two feathers are ſix inches long; in another ſpecimen, I
found them to be eight inches, and the outer webs edged with black
three-fourths of their length, and the remainder white; in a third, theſe two
long feathers were entirely wanting; whether we muſt impute this to ſome
accident, to the age, or to the moulting, which Edwards thinks laſts ſix

                  <p>At Cayenne, this Tyrant is called <hi>Titiri,</hi> from the
reſemblance to its ſhrill noiſy ſcreams. The male and female keep
commonly together in the cleared ſpots of the foreſts; they perch on the
lofty trees; and are very numerous in Guiana. They breed in the hollow trunks,
or in the clefts of the branches below the ſhade of the moſt leafy bough.
If one attempts to plunder their young, their natural audacity changes into
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid fury; they contend obſtinately; they dart upon the perſon;
purſue him; and if, in ſpite of all their exertions, they are unable to
reſcue their dear offspring, they fondly viſit the cage, and carry
food.</p>

but in the Great Pipiri it is fringed with rufous. The diſpoſition of the
ſmall Pipiris is alſo much milder, and not ſo ſavage as the others.

ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient extent to admit local changes. In fact, they leave their uſual
haunts in certain ſeaſons, and follow the maturity of the fruits which feed
their inſect prey. All their other habits are the ſame as thoſe of the
Great Pipiris: both ſpecies are very numerous in St. Domingo, and few birds
occur in more frequency<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p>From the account which Cateſby has given of this bird, we do
not heſitate to claſs it with the Pipiri of St. Domingo, ſince its
diſpoſition and its habits are the ſame<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                        <q rend="inline">"The courage of this little bird is
ſingular. He purſues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near
his ſtation, from the ſmalleſt to the largeſt, none eſcaping his
fury; nor did I ever ſee any that dared to oppoſe him while flying, for he
does not offer to attack them when ſitting. I have ſeen one of them fix on
the back of an Eagle, and perſecute him ſo that he has turned on his back
into various poſtures in the air, in order to get rid of him; and at laſt
was forced to alight on the top of the next tree, from whence he dared not to
move till the little Tyrant was tired, or thought fit to leave him.—This
is the conſtant practice of the cock, while the hen is breeding; he ſits on
the top of a buſh, or ſmall tree not far from her neſt, near which if any
ſmall birds approach, he drives them away; but the great ones, as Crows,
Hawks, Eagles, he will not ſuffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him
without attacking them. They have only a chattering note, which they utter with
great vehemence all the time they are fighting.—When their young are
flown they are as peaceable as other birds."

                     </note>. But it is
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by its red crown, and the manner of placing its neſt,
which is left entirely expoſed in the ſhrubs or buſhes; whereas the
Pipiri con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals its neſt, or even lodges it in the holes of trees. It is
nearly of the ſame ſize as the Great Pipiri: its bill ſeems leſs
hooked: Cateſby ſays only <hi>that it is broad, flat, and tapering.</hi>
The red <pb n="470" facs="tcp:1084600104:518"/> ſpot on the upper-part of its head is very
bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and is encircled with black feathers, which conceal it when they
are cloſed.—This bird ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Virginia and Carolina about the month
of April; there breeds, and departs in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of winter.</p>
                  <p>A bird ſent to the King's cabinet, under the name of
<hi>Louiſiana Tyrant,</hi> appears to be exactly the ſame with the Carolina
Tyrant of Cateſby. It is larger than the fifth ſpecies, or Cayenne Tyrant,
and almoſt equal to the Great Pipiri of St. Domingo. An aſh-colour,
almoſt black, is ſpread over all the upper-part of the body, from the crown
of the head to the end of the tail, which terminates in a ſmall white bar
ſhaped into feſtoons; light whitiſh waves are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed in the ſmall
quills of the wing; ſome ſmall ſtreaks of deep orange, inclined to red,
ſhine through the blackiſh quills on the top of the head; the throat is of
a pretty pure white, which is ſhaded with black on the breaſt, and again
becomes ſnowy from the ſtomach as far as the tail.<note n="A" place="bottom">The Carolina Tyrant builds its neſt with wool and moſs, and
lines it with fibrous roots. It lays five eggs, which are white, with ruſty
ſpots.</note>

gray and white, intermixed with ſome ruſty lines on the wings, compoſe
its varied plumage; white predominates on the under ſurface of the body,
where it is ſprinkled with long blackiſh ſpots; the blackiſh, on the
other hand, is the prevailing colour on the back, where the white forms only
ſome edgings. Two white lines run obliquely, the one over the eyes, the other
below them; ſmall blackiſh feathers half conceal the yellow ſpot on the
crown of the head. The feathers of the tail, which are black in the middle,
have broad borders of rufous; the hind nail is the ſtrongeſt of

not to the diſcriminating lines traced by Nature. The Kinki-Manou is eight
inches and a half long, and is bulky; its head is black; and that colour
extends like a round hood on the top of its neck and under its bill; the
upper-part of its body is cinereous, and the under-part aſh-blue; the bill is

anomalous ſpecies. It is thus deſcribed by Cateſby: 
<q rend="inline">"It is about the bulk of a Sparrow; it has
large black eyes; its bill is thick, ſtrong, and yellowiſh: the whole of
the bird is of a fine red, except the inner fringes of the wing-quills, which

it is a bird of paſſage, and leaves Carolina and Virginia in the winter;

                  <p>Though nomenclators have claſſed this bird with the
Flycatchers, it appears to differ widely both from theſe, and from the
Moucherolles; we have therefore ſeparated it entirely, and aſſigned it
the name of <hi>Drongo,</hi> which it receives in Madagaſcar. Its characters
are: 1. Its bulk, being larger than the Blackbird, and thicker: 2. The tuft on
the origin of the bill: 3. Its bill is not ſo flat: 4. The tarſus and toes
are very ſtrong. All its plumage is black, varying with green; directly under
the root of the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandible ſome long and very narrow feathers riſe
erect to the height of an inch and eight lines; they bend forward, and make a
very odd ſort of creſt; the two outer-quills of the tail project an inch
and ſeven lines beyond the two middle ones; the others are of an intermediate
length, and diverge, which occaſions the tail to be very forked. Commerſon
aſſures us, that the Drongo has a pleaſant warble, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to
the ſong of the Nightingale; and this makes a wide difference from the
Tyrants, which have all ſhrill cries, and are beſides natives of America.
This Drongo was firſt brought from <pb n="479" facs="tcp:1084600104:527"/> Madagaſcar by
Poivre; it has alſo come from the Cape of Good Hope, and from China. We have
remarked that the creſt is wanting in ſome ſpecimens, and we have no
doubt that the bird ſent to the Royal cabinet under the name of <hi>the
Forked-tail Flycatcher of China,</hi> belongs to this ſpecies, and is perhaps
a female; the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, if we except the creſt, being entire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this Chineſe bird and the Drongo.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a kind of Drongo found on the Malabar coaſt,
whence it was ſent by Sonnerat: it is rather larger than that of
Madagaſcar, or that of China; its plumage is wholly black, but its bill is
ſtronger and thicker; it has not the creſt; and what the moſt
diſtinguiſhes it are, the two long ſhafts which project from the ends of
the two outer-quills of the tail; they are almoſt bare for ſix inches of
their length, and have webs near their extremities as at their origin. We are
unacquainted with the habits of this bird of Malabar; but they are probably the
ſame as thoſe of the Drongo of Madagaſcar, ſince the external
characters are alike in both.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the

                  <p>The Piauhau is larger than any of the Tyrants, and is
therefore excluded from the Flycatchers; indeed, except in its bill, it bears
not the leaſt analogy to theſe, and ſeems to occupy a detached place in
the order of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It is eleven inches long, and is larger than the Miſſel
Thruſh. All its plumage is deep black, except a deep purple ſpot that
covers the throat in the male, but is wanting in the female; the wings, when
cloſed, extend as far as the end of the tail; the bill is ſixteen lines
long, and eight broad at the baſe, very flat, and ſhaped almoſt like an
iſoſceles triangle, with a ſmall hook at the point.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds move in flocks, and commonly precede the
Toucans, and always uttering the ſhrill cry <hi>pihauhau:</hi> it is ſaid
that they feed upon fruits like the Toucans; but probably they alſo eat the
winged inſects, for the catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Nature ſeems to have faſhioned
their bill. They are very lively, and almoſt in continual motion. They
reſide only in the woods like the Toucans, and generally haunt the ſame
ſpots.</p>

                     <pb n="481" facs="tcp:1084600104:529"/> Briſſon aſks if the Jacapu of
Marcgrave be not the ſame with the Piauhau<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                        <q rend="inline">"Jacupu, a bird of the bulk of a Lark; its

                     </note>? We may anſwer that it is
not. The Jacapu of Marc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave has indeed a black plumage, with only a purple,
or rather a red ſpot under its throat; but at the ſame times, <hi>its tail
is long, its wing is ſhort, and its ſize is that of a Lark;</hi> theſe
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters do not apply to the Piauhau.<note n="A" place="bottom">Specific

                  <p>Thus the Kinki-Manou and the Drongo of Madagaſcar, the Red
Flycatcher of Virginia and the Piahau of Cayenne, are all contiguous ſpecies,
but eſſentially different from thoſe of the Flycatchers, the
<hi>Moucherolles,</hi> and the Tyrants.</p>
