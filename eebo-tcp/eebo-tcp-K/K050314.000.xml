            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS
OF
Count TARIFF, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>COUNT <hi>Tariff,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory we
are now to write, is a Perſon
who has been ſo much miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
among us, and painted
in ſuch monſtrous Shapes, that 'tis but
a piece of Juſtice to a Stranger to reſcue
his Character from the Mob, and to
ſearch what may be found in ancient
Hiſtory concerning him.</p>
            <p>So far as we have ſearch'd into Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
we find him lineally deſcended
from the ancient Line of the <hi>Tariffs,</hi> a
Family of ſuch Quality as well as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in <hi>France,</hi> that they trace their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
as high as any Hiſtory can be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0435900500:3"/>
found; and they appear equal in Birth
to <hi>Commerce</hi> it ſelf, whoſe Antiquity no
Body doubts of.</p>
            <p>The preſent Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> the chief of
his Family, is a Perſon, who, as well
for his proper Merit as his high Birth as
aforeſaid, has been eſteemed and reſpected
all over <hi>Europe;</hi> and for the great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
he has in his Country, has been
ſought unto by moſt of the Nations in
<hi>Europe,</hi> upon many occaſions.</p>
            <p>He always appear'd to be a Patron of
Trade, as what he eſteem'd was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
conducive to the general Good of
Mankind: As this was his eſpecial Aim,
ſo he did not ſo much apply himſelf to
this or that particular Branch or part of
Trade, but endeavour'd upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to ſhew himſelf a Friend to univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Commerce; as it reſpected the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
and general Advantage of
the World, and from this Rule he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
employ'd the Influence he had
on Affairs, <hi>which was not ſmall</hi> to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation
and good Government of Trade
in his own Country.</p>
            <p>He took on him the general Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Commerce on the 18th of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
1664. which being the firſt time
of his publick Appearance in the World,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0435900500:4"/>
we ſhall not enquire into any part of his
Conduct before that time.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner ſettled and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>his Rules</hi> of Commerce; but all the
Trading part of the World were made
ſenſible of the Advantage they receiv'd
thereby, and conſequently began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
a true and very great Opinion
of his Worth, and very quickly courted
his Friendſhip: This Nation eſpecially
made great Advantage of his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence,
for he was a particular Friend
to the <hi>Engliſh Trade,</hi> and encourag'd it
upon all Occaſions: It is true, he acted
upon open Meaſures of Correſpondence,
and was a Friend to univerſal Trade, <hi>as
above:</hi> He abhorr'd Prohibitions, Reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Excluſion of Nations in Trade;
but if he had any Peculiar, if he treated
any one Nation with Diſtinction more
than another, it was <hi>England;</hi> which was
all the Reaſon that has yet been aſſign'd,
why ſome People in the Kingdom have
treated him with ſuch Rudeneſs and
Diſreſpect ever ſince: But however, they
have uſed him, it is moſt certain <hi>England</hi>
felt the ſenſible Advantage of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and correſponded with him to
their great Profit, as well as Satisfaction
for ſeveral Years, receiving every Year
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0435900500:5"/>
great Sums of Money from him, and by
his means.</p>
            <p>He was particularly a very great Friend
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufacture: He always
appear'd at Court in a Suit of <hi>Engliſh
Broad Cloth,</hi> and cloth'd all his Servants in
the ſame; and tho' his Liveries were plain,
they were handſomer and richer than any
in that Country.</p>
            <p>It happen'd however, after ſome time,
Diviſions prevailing there as well as in
other Courts, that he began to be in
leſs Repute with ſome People than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet he ſtill went on as well as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
would admit, in his own
way, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of encouraging Trade; he
receiv'd all the Equipages of his Servants
and Furniture of his Houſes from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Notwithſtanding the fine Brocades
and rich Silks which are made in <hi>France,</hi>
he cloathed his Counteſs, and the young
Ladies his Daughters, and their Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
in rich <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Silks, fine Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> bought in <hi>England,</hi> and brought
from the <hi>Indies</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi>
Company.</p>
            <p>Upon building his fine Country-Seat
of TARIFF-CASTLE, in <hi>France,</hi>
all the fine Locks and Keys, and ſeveral
other parts of the Furniture came from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0435900500:6"/>
               <hi>England;</hi> the Roof was cover'd with Lead
to diſtinguiſh his Reſpect for the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Commerce, and all the Veſſels and Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils
of his Family, which it was proper to
have ſo, were of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pewter.</p>
            <p>This particular Conduct of the Count,
with reſpect to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, gave
ſome Umbrage in <hi>France;</hi> and whether
it were by the Artifice of ſome of his
Neighbours, who always envy'd and
rivall'd the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> or whether it was
meerly the Inclination of the People there
to ſet up Manufactures of their own, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are not agreed about it; but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> many Enemies at home,
as is before obſerv'd; nay, even his own
Tenants and Neighbours complain'd that
he favour'd Foreigners and foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
alledging that his Coaches
were lined with <hi>Engliſh</hi> CLOTH, his
Rooms hang'd with <hi>Engliſh</hi> STUFFS,
that all his Servants ſmoaked TOBACCO,
and other Circumſtances falling in with
this at the ſame time, the <hi>Count</hi> was
oblig'd to alter his Meaſures, and firſt
declined ſome part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade
by ſeveral publick Acts, as particularly
on the 18th of <hi>April,</hi> 1665. the 20th
of <hi>December,</hi> 1687. and at laſt he was
obliged wholly to renounce it on the 7th
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0435900500:7"/>
of <hi>September,</hi> 1701. Upon theſe Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> being neceſſitated, as
aboveſaid, to lay aſide all Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friends; they, on
the other hand, acted the weakeſt part
that ever was known among Trading Men
and Merchants; for however he had
been their Friend, and however abſur'd,
it was on their ſide to forbid the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their own Manufactures; yet
they took that ſimple Step, and without
reſpect to Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> or the Injury
they did to their own Workmen in the
Countries, and their Families, truly,
they cut off their own Trade, and would
not ſuffer any more Broad-Cloth, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Stuffs, Bays, Kerſies, Dozens, or
any Woollen Manufactures, or other
Goods, to be ſent to Count <hi>Tariff;</hi> by
which piece of Wiſdom they loſt their
Country, the Exportation of above Six
hundred thouſand Pounds a Year, in Goods
of their own Growth or Manufactures;
beſides thoſe of the Growth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of their Plantations and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
            <p>Count
<hi>Tariff</hi> being treated thus by his
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Friends, it was not to be wondred
if Mynheer <hi>Coopmanſchap,</hi> an old Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
and a cunning, tricking, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0435900500:8"/>
ſharping <hi>Dutch</hi> Broker, fell in
with him: This <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi> was a great
Dealer in the Manufactures and Produce
of other Countries, but had very few or
none at all of his own: He drove indeed
a great Trade to moſt parts of the World:
It was he who made that famous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to <hi>Japan,</hi> where when he was asked
by the Emperour, whether he was a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> or not, he anſwer'd, he was a
a HOLLANDER: He had been all
over the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and particularly was
Governour at <hi>Amboyna</hi> upon a certain
Butcherly occaſion, which <hi>Authors ſay</hi> is
nothing to the purpoſe now, becauſe it
was a great while ago: He has driven
a great Trade ever ſince by Interloping
into the Trade of other Nations, but is
eſpecially remarkable for keeping his Word
no longer than he finds it for his Gain,
and then complaining that others DO
SO: It was not many Years before this,
that he was in Partnerſhip with a great
<hi>German</hi> Merchant, one Mynheer <hi>Leopol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
of <hi>Vienna;</hi> in which they had agreed
not to lay down their Trade but by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Conſent, and particularly old <hi>Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſchap</hi>
bound himſelf, not to contract
any Partnerſhip without the Conſent of
<hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and without taking him in;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0435900500:9"/>
but he broke his Word, and left old <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poldus</hi>
in the Lurch before the Voyage
was half finiſh'd; which is mention'd
for their Service, who pretend to ſay he
was injured lately <hi>that may</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was not ignorant of the
Subtilty and Knavery of this Tricking
<hi>Dutchman,</hi> for he had heard his Character,
and had dealt with him before; but his
Circumſtances requiring him to ſettle a
Correſpondence <hi>ſome where,</hi> and having
been ill uſed where he inclined to ſettle,
he found it for his Advantage to engage
with <hi>Mynheer;</hi> and accordingly Articles
of Partnerſhip were ſign'd between them
on the 7th of <hi>December,</hi> 1699.</p>
            <p>It was no ſmall Surprize to the reſt of
the Trading Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> that Count
<hi>Tariff</hi> had ſettled with <hi>Mynheer;</hi> and tho'
it had been better for them all, that he
had continu'd to Trade with the whole
World on equal Terms, as before; yet
when they found that could not be,
they would all have been glad to have
had him excluſively to themſelves; but
old <hi>Coopmanſchap,</hi> according to Cuſtom,
was too cunning for them all, and
knowing the Worth of the <hi>Count,</hi> he
ſupplanted all the World, and got him to
himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0435900500:10"/>
One of the principal Buſineſſes of <hi>Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heer,</hi>
after he had ſecur'd Count <hi>Tariff</hi> to
himſelf, was to prevent his Trading with
any Body elſe; and fain he would have
had the Count have entered into ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
Terms with him, which at firſt
he could not obtain, it being not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their Articles; but it fell in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
upon the occaſion of ſome of
his old Correſpondents prohibiting their
Factors to ſend him any Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
<hi>as aforeſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner had old <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi> and
the Count engaged, but the <hi>Dutchman</hi>
began to inſult all Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s old
Correſpondents, and put the Dice upon
all that Traded with him before; for
no Body could Trade with Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
at all NOW, but they muſt pay
TOLL to old <hi>Coopmanſchap,</hi> no Goods
could be ſent to Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> but in old
<hi>Coopmanſchap</hi>'s Waggons and Ships, ſo that
he became the general <hi>Carryer</hi> to all the
Trade of that ſide of the World, and
got ſomething by every thing that <hi>other
People</hi> dealt in.</p>
            <p>This made him ſo Inſolent, that if
any Propoſals of Peace or Trade were
made to him, his Anſwer was always,
Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> Count <hi>Tariff, ick vil hab
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0435900500:11"/>
Count Tariff,</hi> nothing muſt be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Count <hi>Tariff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt <hi>Mynheer</hi> thinking he had effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſecured all the Trade of the World,
and that he was able to keep every Body
elſe out of it; truly he began to uſe
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> himſelf very ſcurvily, and
on ſeveral Occaſions abuſed him very
groſly; inſomuch that <hi>the Count</hi> who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſaw himſelf maltreated, grew weary
of him: He found that this <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi>
was but a Jobber of other Peoples Trade,
a meer <hi>Pedlar,</hi> a <hi>Waggoner,</hi> or <hi>Carrier</hi> for
other Merchants; that all the Goods he
(Count <hi>Tariff</hi>) bought of him, were
brought to him at <hi>Second Hand,</hi> and that
he might much better have them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Makers and Manufacturers,
and the Countries where they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
Wherefore he (Count <hi>Tariff.</hi>)
reſolved at laſt, to put an end to it; and
accordingly, he wrote him a very plain
Letter, telling him what a cozening old
Knave he had been, how rich he was
grown by means of the Partnerſhip, and
yet how baſely he had treated his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in ſhort told him in ſo many
Words at the end of his Letter, that
he would have no more to do with
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0435900500:12"/>
It is not to be wondred if <hi>Mynheer</hi>
was Thunder-ſtruck at this ſurprizing
Letter; for by it, on a ſudden, he loſt
all thoſe Advantages which had for ſome
time raiſed up both his Purſe and his
Pride; and which had enabled him to
hold up his Head, and think himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with the richeſt Merchant in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
But from this Diſappointment he
began to alter his Tone, and talk a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
humbler than he was wont to do;
mean time he omitted nothing to recover
his former Intereſt in Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> and
if poſſible, to retrieve the Partnerſhip;
and to that purpoſe, he diſpatched two
of his Factors to go to Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s
Houſe, and to try if they could by any
Offers, Submiſſions, and Promiſes, and on
any Conditions whatſoever, retrieve this
Blow; that he might preſerve his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Influence on the Trade of <hi>Europe:</hi>
But after ſeveral vain Attempts of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>he found</hi> that it was impracticable,
and that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was reſolved, <hi>for
his ſake,</hi> that he would never more engage
in a ſeparate Partnerſhip; but that he
had reaſſumed his former generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) of <hi>encouraging univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi>
a thing that did not ſuit with
Mynheer's Deſigns at all; who always
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0435900500:13"/>
advanced himſelf by encroaching on
other Mens Trade, rather than by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on any particular Trade of his own;
as is evident by his Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
which he rifled a great <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Merchant of; his <hi>Herring Fiſhery,</hi> which
he got by Encroachment on the Scots
Merchants, and by his Trade to the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zils</hi>
and <hi>Surinam,</hi> which he ſtole from the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>But Mynheer, who never uſed to give
a Game over while he had any Cards
left in his hand to play, when he found
he could not get Count <hi>Tariff</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
his next Concern was to take care
that the Count ſhould not engage with
any body elſe; and particularly, he was
ſenſible it would be a very great Loſs
to him if any Engliſh Merchants ſhould
embark with him: It ſeems he had had
ſome private Intimation, that Count <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi>
was about making a new Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with one Mr. <hi>Traffick,</hi> an eminent
Merchant and Alderman of <hi>London.</hi>
This Mr. <hi>Traffick</hi> traded, it ſeems, in
Company with one <hi>Harry Woolpack,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Clothier in the Weſt; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they two manag'd the whole Trade
of the Woollen Manufacturers on that
ſide of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0435900500:14"/>
It was a mortal Blow to Mynheer,
to think that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with theſe People, and it put him
into a cold Sweat immediately; for theſe
were the very Men that he had bubbled
for ſo many Years paſt; for having kept
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> under his Thumb, he got
all the Trade into his own Hand, made
thoſe Engliſh Merchants glad to ſell their
Woollen Manufactures to him, ſome <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,</hi>
ſome <hi>unfiniſh'd,</hi> as he pleaſed to
take them, and at <hi>what Price</hi> he pleaſed
to give for them; ſo that they only fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> at ſecond-hand, and
old <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi> got the Profit.</p>
            <p>All the while he did thus he wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Mr. Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Harry
Woolpack</hi> with fine Stories of his being
their only Friend; of his taking off ſuch
vaſt Quantities of their Manufactures
more than other Nations; nay ſometimes
he would ſay more than all the Nations
of the World; and, that no body could
do this but he; <hi>whereas the Truth was,</hi>
that all this while he was only the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleman,</hi>
or Broker, between both; for
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was really the Man who
procured moſt of the Trade, and made
the great Conſumption of the Woollen
Manufactures by encouraging the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0435900500:15"/>
thereof, as aforeſaid, among his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and Servants: and this ſubtle Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had only been a Pick-pocket on
both Sides. As ſoon as Mr. <hi>Traffick</hi> and
<hi>Harry Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lpack,</hi> and their other Partners,
came to underſtand this, it gave them a
moſt contemptible Opinion of old <hi>Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſchap,</hi> and made them reflect with
great Regret on thoſe Councils which
had led them into ſuch a Nooſe, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them to be ſo dup'd, and made Fools
of, by this old Dutch Man for ſo many
Years, to the Ruin of their Trade, and
the enriching of him and his Hangers
on: When their Eyes were thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and they ſaw clearly how they had
been play'd upon and cozen'd, they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with great Readineſs the Propoſals
of <hi>a new Partnerſhip</hi> with Count <hi>Tariff,</hi>
which the Count, by his Agents, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them about that time.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the Treaty of Partnerſhip
between Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> and the Count,
having gone on with great Sincerity and
Application on both ſides, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ſigned between Arbitrators em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by both Parties on the 31ſt of
<hi>March</hi> 1712. tho' this was not brought
to paſs without a mighty Oppoſition of old
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>opmanſchap</hi> and his Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0435900500:16"/>
It was thought at firſt, that the Treaty
having been thus finiſhed, and all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
being thus agreed, there could not
have been any room for a Miſcarriage
after that; and it was not doubted but
Meſſieurs <hi>Traffick and Company</hi> would have
driven a gallant Trade the next Year
with Count <hi>Tariff;</hi> but it proved quite
otherwiſe, by the Subtilty and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Cunning and Diligence of that old
Fox <hi>Coopmanſchap;</hi> the Particulars of whoſe
Intrigues make the next part of our
Story.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi> having been alarmed,
as is ſaid already, by the Report of a
Treaty being ſet on foot between Count
<hi>Tariff</hi> on one hand, and the ſaid Mr. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>Traffick</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the Country, <hi>on the other hand;</hi>
he found there was no time to be loſt;
for theſe, as aforeſaid, were the greateſt
Dealers in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
that were in the World; and
the very ſame Men who he had bought
all the Woollen Goods of, which he had
ſupplied Count <hi>Tariff</hi> with, during their
late Partnerſhip; he knew alſo if the
Count ſell in with them, he ſhould not
only be circumvented and become uſeleſs
in the Trade, but that all his Cunning
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0435900500:17"/>
and Knavery would be expoſed on either
Hand; That firſt Count <hi>Tariff</hi> would ſee
how he had made him pay thro' the Noſe
for every thing which he had bought,
and that he could buy cheaper of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Traffick</hi> and Company; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo, but the Alderman and his Partners
would diſcover alſo, how when he had
beaten down the Price, and brought them
to ſell their Goods ſo monſtrous cheap,
that their poor Workmen could hardly
get Bread by their Labour, he ſold thoſe
Goods at the ſame time for a great Price to
Count <hi>Tariff;</hi> and ſo he had gotten the
Profit of all the Trade to himſelf.</p>
            <p>He was conſcious that when both Sides
came thus to ſee into his Knavery, they
would equally reſent his former Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with them, and never have
any thing to do with him in that reſpect
again; that by this means he ſhould loſe his
Cullies, and be quite ſtript of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
he had always made by them.</p>
            <p>Upon this and many other Miſchiefs
which he foreſaw would follow, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to go over for <hi>England,</hi> and by
all means poſſible, endeavour to prevent
the Partners making their new Treaty
of Partnerſhip EFFECTUAL.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0435900500:18"/>
He was encouraged to make this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
by a ſecret Correſpondence, which
he always held in that Country with a
certain CLUB or Society of Men, who
having certain private wicked Projects of
their own to carry on by his Aſſiſtance,
were declared Enemies to Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
for his ſake; and by conſequence would
be ſure, right or wrong, to oppoſe the
new Partnerſhip Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was making
with their Fellow-Citizens, however it
might be to the prejudice of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
or of themſelves; Envy and Revenge
being the moſt Self-denying Vices in the
World. Theſe People pretended indeed
to be very great Friends to Alderman
<hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Henry Woollpack</hi> his Partner,
yet they had given ſeveral ſufficient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of their being willing to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
them both for the Intereſt of old
<hi>Coopmanſchap;</hi> and even to ſell them and
their Country too into Slavery to him,
to work in his <hi>Raſp-houſe</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
rather than not oblige him to be their
Friend in thoſe other Projects which they
were carrying on, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Having ſuch an Intereſt there, he
made the beſt of his way for <hi>England,</hi>
and had the good Luck to come there
before the Articles of Copartnerſhip, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0435900500:19"/>
the Arbitrators on both Sides had made
between Count <hi>Tariff</hi> and his new Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
were arrived.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was come to <hi>London,</hi>
he gave notice to his truſty Friend Sir
<hi>Politick Falſhood,</hi> who was generally Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of that Society, that he Purpoſed
to be at the Club the next Day, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
intimated the ſame to the whole
Party, in order to have a full Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Being come to the Club, and having
ſaluted the Members, he ſtood up and
made a Speech to them to the following
Purpoſe.</p>
            <q>
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng">

                        <head>Here follows an Account of the Speech which
Mynheer VAN COOPMANSCHAP made
at his firſt Appearance in the Club.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, He gave them thanks for the
great Services they had done him
upon all Occaſions in time paſt, and the
great Obligations which they had laid
upon him; <hi>for That,</hi> not regarding their
Country, their Liberty, their preſent
Advantages, or their Poſterity, they had,
with a ſteady and unſhaken Zeal, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
preferred his <hi>Intereſt</hi> to THEIR
OWN.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0435900500:20"/>
He acknowledged, that in a former
Partnerſhip, wherein they had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with him, they never inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his paying in the Proportions of
STOCK agreed upon between them;
But had very kindly carried on <hi>their own
Part,</hi> and moſt of <hi>his too,</hi> tho' at the
ſame time they were fain to run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into heavy Debts, <hi>more than ever
they were like to have paid,</hi> beſides ſeveral
other Inconveniencies to <hi>do</hi> it; and alſo
altho' the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of the Profit of
the Partnerſhip fell to HIS SHARE; all
which, he told them, added to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
of their Treatment of him, and
which therefore obliged him to this
grateful Remembrance thereof.</p>
                        <p>He owned, and <hi>therewith he made them
a Grimace,</hi> that they had been very
Friendly to him, in not examining his
Accounts relating to the ſaid Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
but had paſſed them upon <hi>his Credit,</hi>
which he (being utterly unable to make
a fair Account) was very much obliged
to them for.</p>
                        <p>He could not forget, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> how
frankly they had furniſhed the greateſt
part of the Ships employed in their Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip,
even without charging him for
his ſhare of the Freight, whereby he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0435900500:21"/>
had been at leiſure to carry on the
<hi>North-Seas-Trade,</hi> which was quite out
of the Partnerſhip, at their Expence; and
which had encouraged him to charge
even thoſe Ships alſo which were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the ſaid ſeparate Trade to the
<hi>North-Seas,</hi> as if employed in the ſaid
Partnerſhip, to his unſpeakable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
for which he ſaid he was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
obliged to them.</p>
                        <p>That whereas they had been equally
concerned for ſeveral Years paſt, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on an Undertaking for the French
PHILOSOPHERS STONE, which
as it had been both hazardous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive,
ſo it had been owned to be,
<hi>as ſuch Projects generally are,</hi> very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſucceed, eſpecially to the height that
ſome propoſed; he told them he thought
himſelf obliged to confeſs, that they
had generouſly ſupplied more Workmen
for the ſaid Undertaking than they were
bound to furniſh by their Agreement,
and yet had not made him pay toward
the extraordinary Charge of it. It is

you faithfully how much it would be

you were ſo kind as not to inſiſt

Friendſhip to me.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>he told them</hi> he had yet greater
things than thoſe to thank them for,
and particularly, that <hi>bold Step</hi> they took
on his Account, and which few Partners
but they would have ventur'd at, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That when ſeveral of his principal Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents
in <hi>England</hi> were in danger of
being turned out of their Shops and
Employments by their LANDLADY,
the Club had appeared ſo much intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Behalf, as to depute ſome of
their RUDEST Members to Her, to
tell her <hi>very reſpectfully,</hi> that ſhe ought
not to do ſo; that ſhe ought to have
conſulted them in the Management of
her Servants and Family; that if ſhe
ventur'd to do it, ſhe would entirely
loſe their Favour, and did not ſtick to
threaten her, <hi>tho' ſhe was their own Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady</hi>
too, that in ſuch caſe they would
ſhew their Reſentment, and would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give her or her Tenants, or her
Workmen, Credit for one Farthing of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0435900500:23"/>
Mony, nor ſuffer any body elſe to do
it, nay nor pay her their Rent neither,
if they could help it; which Threatning,
tho' it did not ſucceed according to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
yet was ſuch an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Step in his Favour, as he could not
but think himſelf very much obliged to
them for it.</p>
                        <p>He told them farther, that he was
particularly obliged to thank them for
another Inſtance of their Zeal for his
Intereſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that when ſome Britiſh
Merchants came over to a Place called
<hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> a City in his Country, in order
to recover a certain Branch of Trade
out of his Hands which he had circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
them of before, the Society had
endeavoured to expoſe and ruin thoſe
Merchants, loudly declaring in all their
Societies, as well <hi>Grecian</hi> as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that
it was neither juſt nor honeſt to take
any thing away from Mynheer <hi>Van
Coopmanſchap,</hi> or to get any thing for
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> and Company, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
letting him have an equal Share
of it, <hi>or, in ſhort,</hi> to diſoblige him in any
reſpect whatſoever: So that they juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him highly in the Practice of what
every one knew was his Principle, <hi>viz.</hi>
That what every one elſe got ſhould
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0435900500:24"/>
be part of it his, and what he himſelf
got ſhould be all his own.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He thank'd them,</hi> he ſaid, that in their
late famous Voyage or Adventure to
<hi>Terra</hi> (Gertrudenburg) <hi>Incognita,</hi> in
which they had been alſo Partners, yet
the Club had generouſly left the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the whole Voyage to him,
owning themſelves not fit to be truſted
in Affairs (tho' their own) of ſo nice
a nature; by which, had not his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
native Avarice prompted him to
graſp the Shadow and let ſlip the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
he might have made a very good
Voyage for himſelf, at the Expence of
all the reſt of his Partners; but as he
had no body to blame for the Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
but himſelf, ſo he thank'd them
for their Good-will, whatever Loſs he
ſuſtain'd by the Voyage.</p>
                        <p>It was true, he ſaid, that another
Miſcarriage of his had been the Effect
of their Advice to him, (<hi>viz.</hi>) when
they perſwaded him to adhere to the
Executors of old <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and preferr
his German-Partnerſhip to all other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements;
which piece of Council
overthrew the whole Voyage; for as <hi>on
the one hand</hi> he ſlip'd a good Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and refuſed an advantageous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0435900500:25"/>
of another Partnerſhip, which he
inclined to embark in; and which, had
he cloſed with it, would have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the diſmal Events that followed:
So, <hi>on the other hand,</hi> he not only was
diſappointed in all his chimerical Hopes
of that Voyage, but had all his Veſſels
plundered, his Goods and Merchandizes
taken away, and moſt of his Agents
and Servants were knock'd on the Head,
and thrown over-board, or carried into
Slavery; which forced him, at laſt,
ſhamefully to quit the ſaid <hi>German Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip,</hi>
and to loſe all thoſe Advantages
that had been offered him at firſt, as
aforeſaid; however, he ſaid, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Society did it for the beſt,
and had only acted by him as they did
for themſelves, and according to their
kown Politicks, (viz.) <hi>Never to know
when they are well,</hi> ſo he could not blame
them in the leaſt.</p>
                        <p>He acknowledged, that their general
Conduct had been always with an Eye
to his Intereſt and Grandeur, which
they had given him ſo many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of that it was very much to his
Satisfiction, and which he had ſo far
depended upon, as had made him talk
in a different Tone from what he uſed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0435900500:26"/>
to do, to ſeveral of his other Partners;
for that he knew they were always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to back him in and approve of all
the Meaſures he took for advancing his
own Trade: and that they were always,
willing to ſink their own Stocks, and
throw away their own Eſtates, rather
than he ſhould be a Sufferer.</p>
                        <p>He told them alſo, that he thankfully
remembred how they had given him
timely notice, when they deſigned to
ruin the Publick Credit, if it had been
in their Power, that he might have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
time to draw out his Mony;
whereas had their Deſign ſucceeded, he
might, without ſuch notice, have been
a very great Loſer.</p>
                        <p>It was true, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> he had obſerved
that altho' they had informed him that
their <hi>Landlady</hi> was a Bankrupt, and her
Credit broke, and perſwaded him not
to lend her Mony; yet, as ſoon as ſhe
had offered them a ſmall Advantage in
the Loan, they all run in privately, and
lent their own Mony, leaving him out:
But as this was nothing but what he
taught them, and as he would have
done by them if it had been in his
Power, he was not at all diſobliged by
it, knowing they would make him amends
for it many other ways.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0435900500:27"/>
He told them, he was in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner obliged to them in other
Affairs of their Partnerſhip, eſpecially
for drawing up proper Memorials for
him upon certain Occaſions, in which
they were ſo zealou, for his Intereſt,
and ſo willing to make him popular,
that they had frequently ventur'd to
Print them before they had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and if at any time his ſecret
Management had been diſcovered, and
the People began to entertain a mean
Opinion of his Honeſty, they always
had employed their whole Set of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers
to vindicate him, who had
covered the fouleſt of his Actions with
the moſt popular Lyes they could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
of which they were very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and by an infinite number of Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Invectives, and Libels, even againſt
<hi>their Landlady herself,</hi> and all her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Servants, they had diverted the
Rage of the People, and impos'd upon
them in ſuch a manner, that his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
which was much in Danger by
ſome Miſtakes he had fallen into, ſtood
very right again with the People; and
as he had maintained a kind of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence,
<hi>from the Teeth outward only,</hi>
with their <hi>Landlady,</hi> which however he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0435900500:28"/>
was alwas ready to break off when their
Intereſt ſhould require it, he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hop'd kept himſelf in a Condition
to requite the Favours he had received
from them.</p>
                        <p>That for his part, he ſaid, tho' he
ſhould not boaſt of his Merit, yet he
hoped he had not been wanting on all
Occaſions to ſhew his reſpect to them,
and to lay all the Obligations upon
them which it was in his Power to do.
That upon all Occaſions he had ſupported
them in their private Deſigns and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
againſt their <hi>Landlady</hi> and her
Adherents, Family, and Servants; that
he had acquieſced in all the Memorials
they had drawn up for him, and been
as well ſatisfied with them when they
were drawn up at the farther End of
<hi>Piccadilly,</hi> as when they were done at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which alſo had ſaved him a
great deal of Trouble; and tho' in one of
thoſe Memorials they had committed a
fatal Miſtake, in acknowledging the Fact
which it was intended to deny, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
about his having not ſupplyed the Quota
of Ships to the Partnerſhip which he
had agreed to furniſh, yet he was very
well ſatisfied with the Invention they
found out to cover it, whether it were
Truth of Fact or no.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0435900500:29"/>
He modeſtly put them in mind of
his great Concern for them in another
Affair, wherein he had made himſelf
Arbitrator for the Succeſſion of their
Trade in the next Age; and preſerving
a Partnerſhip, which it was agreed
ſhould be entered into, after a certain
Engagement was expired, with ſome
Merchants of <hi>Brunſwick;</hi> which tho' they
all knew there was not the leaſt need
of, that it was in it ſelf nothing at
all, that Contract being effectually
ſecured by the Circumſtances and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing; yet as it was of uſe
to them otherways, and ſerved to make
the Reputation of the Club ſwell among
ſome People, ſo he had done it to ſerve
them; at the ſame time taking ſuch effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Care to preſerve their Trade in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
by ſecuring it all into his own
Hands, that he hoped it was to their
exceeding great Satisfaction: He put
them in mind how for their ſakes he
had continued his Partnerſhip with the
Executors of old <hi>Leopolaus</hi> Merchant of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> altho' Count <hi>Tariff</hi> had made
him very great Offers to break the
ſame; and altho' he had met with very
great Loſſes in carrying it on, and altho'
one Merchant <hi>Eugene,</hi> who was Factor
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0435900500:30"/>
for the ſaid Partnerſhip, had impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and outſtood his Market, having
been outwitted by Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and ſo had ſpoiled the whole Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
as he had juſt now told them.</p>
                        <p>He aſſured them in the next place, that
as he had ſerved them with all his <hi>uſual</hi>
Sincerity in theſe and many other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſo he was ſtill ready to aſſiſt and ſtand
by them in their private Concerns, and
to renew the Partnerſhip they had carried
on ſo long, and which they had ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
been engaged in, for as many
Years as they ſhould think fit; that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
he was ready to ſupport them
and aſſiſt them in any Meaſures which
they ſhould think proper againſt their
Landlady, whether to expoſe, ridicule,
and affront her Perſon and the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Family and Houſhold, or
to oppoſe any of her Deſigns, however
laudable and uſeful for the good of her
Tenants; (at which words the Aſſembly,
in token of Gratitude, and accepting the
Offer, ſtood all up) and Mynheer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
another <hi>Dutch</hi> Bow went on—</p>
                        <p>He told them, that he was ſtill very
ready to ſettle Matters of Trade for
this part of the World, if they would
but ſtick faſt to their old Maxims of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0435900500:31"/>
it all to him, and being willing that
his Intereſt ſhould be ſecured firſt and
then their own brought in as ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
and finally, he profeſt himſelf ready
to require their Kindneſs at all times,
if he might but enjoy the Benefit of
their Trade, excluſive of themſelves, <hi>as

                        </p>
                        <p>He then came to the main Point: He
told them, that he underſtood there

<hi>London,</hi> and his Partner <hi>Henry Woolpack</hi> of
the <hi>Weſt,</hi> for a Partnerſhip with Count

they came to be <hi>made Effectual,</hi> would be
very prejudicial to his Affairs, and that
therefore he deſired their utmoſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance

                        <p>Then he fell to railing at Count

and a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and a tricking falſe Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that never kept his word with any
Body, that he was a Bankrupt, and not

that he would crowd them with
his own Goods, ſuch as Wine, Brandy,
Silk, Linnen, Paper, &amp;c. but would
take little or nothing of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
only give them large Promiſes
and good Words, with which he would
feed them till the Partnerſhip was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled

would laugh at them; and with much
more of this kind he ended his Speech.</p>

they had done their Endeavour to
prevent; however it might be againſt
the Honour and the Intereſt of their
Country.'</p>
               <p>'He told him, <hi>the Club</hi> was very ſorry
they had been any way inſtrumental to
the loſs of that Voyage of his, where
his Ships were taken, his Goods plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and his Men thrown overboard,

on the Aſſurances, which he had ſent

<hi>Eugene,</hi> who was Factor for
Mynheer <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> would carry on that

help, or any Auxiliary Stock; and that
they never ſuſpected that thoſe Promiſes
of <hi>Merchant Eugene</hi> had been all but

able to perform them, for that the ſaid
<hi>Eugene</hi> was always eſteemed an expert
Merchant, and one who being bred to
Buſineſs, always <hi>kept right Accounts,</hi> and
might be depended upon in Adventures
of the niceſt Nature; that therefore the

He told him, the Society were ſorry
he had been obliged to quit his <hi>German

but they were glad <hi>for his ſake,</hi> that he
had at laſt put an end to it, being afraid
his <hi>German</hi> Partner would ruin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

of his ſaid Factor Merchant <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene,</hi>
eſpecially in carrying on that Trade,
which was too hazardous and expenſive
for <hi>his</hi> Strength of Stock; and that it
was rumoured already upon Change,
that his Bills had been proteſted in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that it was
feared we ſhould quickly hear there was
a Commiſſion of Bankrupt taken out
againſt him, and that he would make a
Compoſition with his Creditors.'</p>
               <p>'He told him, tho' the Society had
been diſappointed in every thing they
had undertaken for him, and were at
this time but in mean Circumſtances;
their Character declining, their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
very low, and moſt of their valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Men gone off from them to the
Intereſt of their <hi>Landlady,</hi> having by
her Advice joined in a new Partnerſhip
with Merchant <hi>Moderation,</hi> an old and
known Enemy to the whole Society,
yet as their Spirit (<hi>Malice</hi>) was not in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0435900500:36"/>
the leaſt abated, and that they had yet
Members enough left to make a great
Effort (Noiſe) in his Favour, ſo he
might depend upon their utmoſt Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in every thing whatſoever that
he deſired; in return whereof, they
hoped <hi>Mynheer</hi> would continue to be
their conſtant Friend and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the ſame manner as he had
done before; adding, that they had one
farther Requeſt to make to him, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That whereas they might probably find
it needful ſometimes, in carrying on
his Intrigues, or their own; to make
themſelves obnoxious to the Law, and
which was likely to be very frequent,
to fly from Juſtice, run away from Bail,
and <hi>ſuch like,</hi> he would engage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Criminals, and make them
Burgeſſes in his Cities and free Denizens,
Naturalizing them among the Servants
of his Family, as would be moſt ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to them, and to him alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were felonious-Bankrupts,
Murtherers of Nobility, Duellers, Scots
Libellers, Traytors, or what kind of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
ſoever.'</p>
               <p>'That as to the new Treaty of Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
with Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> he told him
there was no doubt but the Club would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0435900500:37"/>
eſpouſe his Cauſe, <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> againſt
that <hi>Frenchman</hi> and all his Attempts;
that the name of <hi>French</hi> would make it
exceeding Popular, and they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſpread it over the whole Nation,
that he was a Pick-pocket, a Conjurer,
and dealt with the Devil, and they
doubted not to have him Mobb'd if he
came hither.'</p>
               <p>'He <hi>told him,</hi> that as to Alderman <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
he knew he was an eminent Dealer,
and underſtood Trade, and perhaps he
might be ſteady as to his old Notions of
the Liberty of Trade; but as for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<hi>Woolpack</hi> he knew him well enough,
that he was a well-meaning Country-Fellow,
but very Paſſionate, and
Ignorant, and he did not queſtion but
the Club would find means to Impoſe
upon his Judgment, by telling him a
hundred Stories and Shams of this
<hi>Frenchman Count Tariff;</hi> and if they
did but once make him believe that
<hi>Count Tariff</hi> would take off none of his
Manufactures, he would go ſtark Mad,
and break off the new Partnerſhip at
once, or quarrel with Alderman <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi>
his Partner, and refuſe to go on
with the Trade; concluding upon the
whole, in the Name of the Society,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0435900500:38"/>
that he might depend upon it, they
were all <hi>Mynheers</hi> hearty Friends more
than their own.'</p>

a Tool of his who ſat at his Elbow, lately

            <q>Reſolved, Nemine Contradicente,</q>
            <p>That the Thanks of the Club be given

made another Speech, and directed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
then to the <hi>Club, Mynheer</hi> being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
in which he ſpoke with a great

            <q rend="inline">
               <p>'He told them, that having heard

and what return had been
made to him, he expected no other, but
that they would Reſolve to aſſiſt and
ſtand by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they had done;
and that now having thus entered upon
the thing, the next and immediate Step
was, that they ſhould conſider of <hi>Ways</hi>
and <hi>Means,</hi> to put in execution what
they had Reſolved on; that no time was
to be loſt; that they expected every Poſt
to hear that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was come over,
and that the Articles of Partnerſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> &amp;c.
would preſently be Ratifyed, and a Law
paſs to make them EFFECTUAL,
and that then all was loſt, and their faſt
Friend <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi> would be ruined.'</p>
               <p>'Then he run out in the praiſe of <hi>Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heer,</hi>
how neceſſary it was to them to

againſt the <hi>Landlady,</hi> if they loſt <hi>Mynheer,</hi>
and that all their Trade (juggling) which
they had carried on ſo long with <hi>Mynheer
van Coopmanſchap</hi> would be ſpoiled, if
they did not prevent it juſt now.'</p>
               <p>'<hi>Then he fell foul upon Count Tariff,</hi> you
have heard his Character, ſaid he, from
<hi>Mynheer van Coopmanſchap</hi>'s own Mouth,
what a Tricking, Cozening, Bankrupt
Fellow he is, and what a Trade we are
like to have with him, if this Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſhould proceed; and therefore, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Sir Pol,</hi> my good Friends, I would
not have you be deceived by thoſe who
talk of your having a great Trade with
him; It is all a Cheat: How ſhould
he want any of your Manufactures when
he can make them all himſelf by his own
Tenants and Servants whom he has
lately ſet up, and given great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to them out of his own Eſtate?
and as to the defect of Wooll, which
they pretend to ſay will prevent this,
that is effectually Anſwered by the News
which came to me by the laſt Poſt, and
which I thought fit to communicate to
you, that it may by your Diligence and
Correſpondence in the Country, be
ſpread about among the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers
and Clothiers of <hi>Britain, (viz.</hi>)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0435900500:41"/>
That this Count <hi>Tariff</hi> has found out a
new Invention not only to ſupply his
own Tenants and Servants with good
Woollen Manufactures, but that in a
little time he would be able to ſupply
the whole World with Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
even <hi>Britain</hi> and all; for that
by this new Invention, they could make
FINE Manufactures of COARSE Wooll,
and he was told of another new Project
ſetting up juſt now among them of making
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures in <hi>France with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Wooll AT ALL,</hi> which, if they
ſhould bring to Perfection, <hi>as he feared
they would,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade would be
quite ruined, and the <hi>French</hi> Tenants of
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> would Underſell them at
all the Markets in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that he
doubted not but <hi>the Club</hi> would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that it was their own Intereſt as
well as his, to prevent Count <hi>Tariff</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into any Meaſures here.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Club were mightily affected with
this part of Sir <hi>Pol</hi>'s Speech, and the Noiſe
interrupted him for ſome time; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in a great Conſternation, as well
they might, at the mention of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
being ſet on foot in <hi>France,</hi> for making
<hi>Broad-Cloth, Sarges,</hi> &amp;c. WITHOUT
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0435900500:42"/>
WOOLL, and a wiſe Senator of the Club
wrs obſerved to ſhake his Head, and with
a deep Sigh to ſend forth this Ejaculation,
LAURD! ſaid he, <hi>What will become of
poor</hi> England! <hi>This will ruin us all with a
Witneſs!</hi> What! <hi>The</hi> French <hi>Manufactures</hi>
without Wooll! good lack! <hi>This is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

the</hi> New Miniſtry <hi>have a Hand in

England.</p>
            <p>There was a general Murmur thro
the whole Society on this ſurprizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
inſomuch that the Houſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>'He told them he had been with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
Traffick,</hi> and it is true, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I
found him inflexible, he talked loudly of
the vaſt Advantages of the Partnerſhip
with Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> the great Quantities
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures he was formerly
accuſtomed to take off, and would now
again take off of our Hands; but ſaid
Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> I will confute them all by one
piece of Conduct of mine, for ſince <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
Traffick</hi> cannot be brought over,
we muſt overpower him, and run him
down by our Numbers and Noiſe; for
this end, <hi>ſays he,</hi> it is abſolutely neceſſary
to ſeparate <hi>Harry Woolpack</hi> from him,
<hi>that is,</hi> to ſow ſuch Jealouſies and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings
between the Country
Manufacturers and the Merchants, that
they may not join together in this Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip;
and therefore, <hi>continues he,</hi> I
deſign in the next place, to attack my
old Acquaintance <hi>Harry Woolpack,</hi> and I
doubt not, with a little help, to make
this Affair ſo popular, that I will make
<hi>Harry</hi> aſhamed to ſhow his Face in the
Country, if he does not break off this
Partnerſhip with <hi>Tariff.</hi>'</p>

To this purpoſe, <hi>ſays he,</hi> we muſt in
the firſt place, ſet to work all our Agents
to expoſe, beſpatter, villify, blacken,
and defame Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> and that not
only here in the Town, which we can
do by the Aſſiſtance of our Friends at
<hi>North</hi>'s, and at the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Coffee-Houſes,
not forgetting our learned Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
at the <hi>Grecian;</hi> but alſo in all the
Cloathing and Manufacturing Towns
and Countries throughout <hi>England;</hi> for
this Work, <hi>ſays he,</hi> turning to two
<hi>Blackwell-Hall-Factors,</hi> who ſat next him,
here's my Friend <hi>Joſiah White-Cloth</hi> and
<hi>Phil. Medley,</hi> Men of Intereſt in the
Country, ſhall write our Minds to <hi>Harry

able to prevail, there's old <hi>Joſhua Double-dozen,</hi>
the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Man, ſhall threaten
him with his Mob out of the <hi>North;</hi>
and there is no doubt but <hi>Harry Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack</hi>
will come up to Town, and tell
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> to his Face, that he
will have nothing to do with Count
<hi>Tariff.</hi>'</p>
            </q>
            <p>Sir <hi>Poll</hi> received ſeveral Humms, and
other Teſtimonies of Applauſe, from the
Club, as he went on with this; by which
they ſignified their full Approbation of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0435900500:45"/>
every thing he ſaid to them; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him to proceed as follows.</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>'<hi>He told them,</hi> the breaking of <hi>Harry
Wooll-pack</hi> from his Engagements with
Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> was, <hi>tho' in it ſelf a
Trifle,</hi> of very great Conſequence to
many other of their Deſigns, as well as
this of Count <hi>Tariff;</hi> for it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
affect all the People of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi>
it would alarm all the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers,
and make them believe their
Trade was to be loſt and undone, and
that they ſhould be ruined; it will
make, <hi>ſays he,</hi> all the Clothing Towns
write up to their Repreſentatives, and
perſwade them that all is at ſtake, and
that they'll CHOOSE them NO
MORE, if they do not take care about
it in Parliament: nay, <hi>ſays Sir Poll in
ſome Extacy,</hi> it is not to be imagined
how far we may run this Thought; I
queſtion not, <hi>ſrys he,</hi> but we ſhall make
it a <hi>DOCTOR SACHEVERELL</hi> to us,
and perhaps may make as good uſe of
it for our purpoſe, as was made by
other People of that Affair of Dr. <hi>Sache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verell</hi>'s,
which it is evident was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to a quite contrary purpoſe to what
it was deſigned for; and as the former
part ſaid he will be eaſily managed by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0435900500:46"/>
our Aſſiſtants at the places before named,
ſo we can never want a Detachment of
Bullies from <hi>Jenny Man</hi>'s and <hi>St. James</hi>'s
Coffee-houſe, to aſſiſt in the latter, and
make a Tumult for us if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.'</p>
               <p>'Our Buſineſs then, <hi>continued he,</hi> is to
raiſe <hi>Harry Wool pack</hi>'s Paſſions, for he
is naturally a hot-headed Fellow, and
as furious and inconſiderate <hi>as my ſelf</hi>
when he is moved; and when we have
ſcrew'd him up to a pitch, he'll make
<hi>ſuch a Noiſe,</hi> no body <hi>elſe</hi> ſhall be heard
all over the Kingdom but he: beſides,
he has a prodigious Intereſt in the
Country; as well <hi>Landed-men</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-men,</hi>
as <hi>Monied-men,</hi> they are all of
his ſide; and if once he raiſes his Voice,
he can call a ſtrange multitude about
him: There's <hi>Sergius Perpetuanus</hi> the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> is always at his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
with an hundred thouſand <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire-men,</hi>
and as many from <hi>Taunton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean;</hi>
There's <hi>Joſhua Double-dozen</hi> and
<hi>Tom Kerſie</hi> out of the <hi>North,</hi> from <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax</hi>
and <hi>Leeds;</hi> they were famous for
their Numbers in Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time:
Then there's <hi>Goad Cotton</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
ap Plane</hi> the Welch-man; they are
all at his Beck, and are able to raiſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0435900500:47"/>
all <hi>North-Wales, Shropſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
for him; beſides <hi>Henry Stroudwater</hi>
of <hi>Cirenceſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Iſaac Re-Bay</hi> of <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Jack All-Stuff</hi> of <hi>Norwich, Benjamin
Drugget</hi> of <hi>Newberry,</hi> and ſeveral others,
who are all ſuch Dependants upon this
<hi>Wooll-pack,</hi> that if he does but hold up
his Finger, they are at his Beck; ſo
that, <hi>in ſhort,</hi> the Sum of this Matter
is to perſwade <hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> to break
this Bargain, and to fright him with
the Apprehenſions of loſing all his
Trade. Let us get but this done then,
<hi>ſays he,</hi> and we need not value <hi>Old Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick;</hi>
for if he inſiſts upon it never ſo
much, if <hi>Wool-pack</hi> does not come in,
it can never go on, or be made EFFE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTUAL.'</p>
               <p>'It follows next, ſays <hi>Sir Pol,</hi> that we
conſider of the Methods to bring this
to paſs; and the only way to do this,
<hi>as I ſaid before,</hi> is to beſpatter Count
<hi>Tariff,</hi> and heap up all the Scandal we
can upon him, by which we ſhall make
him frightful and odious to <hi>Wooll-pack</hi>
and his Friends; and if he ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
after this to come over hither, to
get the Articles of his new Partnerſhip
made EFFECTUAL, we'll bring <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wooll-pack</hi> in, as Plaintiff, get him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0435900500:48"/>
for a Cheat, and a Pick-pocket,
and have him Tried for his Life.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Speech was too full of Gall, Party-Rage,
and particular Malice, not to ſuit
well and be very acceptable to the whole
Aſſembly; for Temper and Moderation
was long ago hiſs'd out of the Club, as
an Enemy to the Being and Nature of
their Conſtitution; like a Coward, who
is Troop'd out of a Camp by <hi>Beat of
Drum,</hi> as a Perſon of no manner of uſe
in the Army.</p>
            <p>Being then ſufficiently prepared by this
Plan of their Proceedings, laid down by
<hi>Sir Poll,</hi> they fell to work immediately,
and firſt they voted that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was
a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and therefore let the Gain
of the Partnerſhip be what it would, we
had better be without him. This was
voted with ſuch a Clamour in the Club,
that nothing could be heard for a great
while but the repeated Cry of No <hi>French
Man!</hi> no <hi>French Wine!</hi> no <hi>French Trade!</hi>
no <hi>Brandy!</hi> ſell no Manufactures to a
<hi>French-man!</hi> and the like.</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>'The laſt Word ſtartled a certain
<hi>Warehouſe-man</hi> in the Club, whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
could not tell how to lye like the
reſt, <hi>Hold there a little, ſays he,</hi> ſell no
Manufactures to a <hi>French-man!</hi> Hang it,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0435900500:49"/>
                  <hi>ſays he,</hi> I can't go that Length neither,
for I ſold one of Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s Friends
a thouſand Pounds worth of Druggets
and Serges but laſt Week: <hi>That won't do
ſays he;</hi> and ſo taking the Opportunity
of the Hurry, he ſneak'd out of the
Club.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>But the Vote paſſed, <hi>as above,</hi> with too
much Noiſe for any thing of Reaſon
or Argument to be heard. This was no
ſooner over, but another Wiſe-man ſtands
up, (whether he was a <hi>Salter</hi> or a <hi>Grocer,</hi>
Authors are not agreed about it.) But
addreſſing himſelf to the Chair, <q rend="inline">'<hi>Sir Pol,</hi>
ſays he. I underſtand this Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
is a <hi>French-man,</hi> then to be ſure he is a
<hi>Jacobite,</hi> and will bring in the <hi>Pretender</hi>
upon us; <hi>ergo,</hi> all they who are for
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> are <hi>Jacobites.</hi> I deſire it
may be put to the Queſtion; which was
done thus:'</q>
            </p>
            <p>RESOLVED, That it is the Opinion
of this Society, that all thoſe who are
for Trading with a <hi>French-man</hi> are <hi>JA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COBITES:</hi>
Upon which the Houſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Yeas 116, No's</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>So it was carried by a great Majority;
But that not being ſatisfactory to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
who propoſed it, <hi>who was for thorough
Work,</hi> he moved again, and ſaid, it was a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0435900500:50"/>
Diſhonour to the Club, that ſuch a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Vote <hi>as that</hi> ſhould not have paſſed
<hi>Nemine contradicente;</hi> and therefore the
11 <hi>No</hi>'s ought to be Expelled the Houſe,
<hi>which was accordingly done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 11 Members who were voted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd,
deſired to explain themſelves; but
a Scots Pamphleteer, <hi>ſince fled from Juſtice,</hi>
ſtood up, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> the Tories condemned
a Peer to loſe his Head, in his Country,
for offering an Explanation to a publick
Act: and he was ſure thoſe 11 Members
were Tories in Diſguiſe; for ſure none
but a Tory would Trade with a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
and therefore he was for farther
Proſecution againſt them: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which</hi> the
11 withdrew, for fear of ſome of his
Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The next Queſtion was, <hi>What Religion
Count</hi> Tariff <hi>was of?</hi> This produced a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
Cry, of a <hi>Papiſh,</hi> a <hi>Papiſh,</hi> a <hi>Papiſh!</hi>
no Trade with a <hi>Papiſh!</hi> no Trade with
a <hi>Papiſh!</hi> and ſuch as that: and this rung
round the Club-Room, like a Vote in the
Common-Hall when a Sheriff is put up
from the Huſtings, which is uſually a
Quarter of an Hour a ſounding.</p>
            <p>After many Debates of this nature, <hi>it
was reſolved,</hi> That the Votes of the Club
ſhould be made publick, and be ſent down
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0435900500:51"/>
into the <hi>Weſt</hi> to their honoured Friend <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Wooll-pack,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and, that he be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by his truſty Correſpondent <hi>Joſiah
White-cloth,</hi> and <hi>Phil. Medley,</hi> that as it is
reſolved in the Committee, that it cannot
be ſafe for <hi>England</hi> that he ſhould trade
with Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> who is a <hi>French-man,</hi>
a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> ſo that this is
the Advice of the whole Club to him, and
that he ſhould take care not to be wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into it by Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> for that
altho' the ſaid <hi>Traffick</hi> was an experienc'd
Merchant, and generally ſpeaking, an
honeſt Man; yet he was lately turned
about, and was on the wrong Side; that
it was to be feared he was inclined to the
<hi>Pretender,</hi> and therefore he ſhould have
a care of him; for if he was drawn in
to join in the Partnerſhip, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor did they ſtop here;</hi> but they order'd
that the Character of Count <hi>Tariff</hi> ſhould
be defamed, and beſpattered as much as
poſſible by their Scots Pamphleteer afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
as long as he durſt ſtay for fear of
the Pillory; and by their <hi>Lying Poſts,</hi> their
daily Libels, circular Letters, and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Prints of every kind, for which they
had their Authors and Printers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
always in Pay: and they gave them
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0435900500:52"/>
a general Order, not to ſtick at any thing,
ſo it would but blacken Count <hi>Tariff</hi> and
Alderman <hi>Traffick;</hi> nor to ſtick at any
Perſon that ſpake in their behalf, tho' it
were the <hi>Landlady</hi> herſelf; agreeing alſo,
that they would carry on the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
themſelves in all their Converſation,
and at all the Committees of their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
held at the uſual Places, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
Jenny Man</hi>'s, <hi>St. James</hi>'s, and thoſe
in the City, <hi>viz. North</hi>'s, the <hi>Amſterdam,
Hamlin</hi>'s, &amp;c. and that this ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on univerſally, without Reſpect of
Perſons as aforeſaid; but eſpecially upon
their <hi>Landlady,</hi> who they reported to be
ſick and dying, and openly acknowledged
they <hi>wiſh'd it was ſo,</hi> till the Brewer in
<hi>Thames-ſtreet</hi> was taken up for it, which
terrified the disbanded Officer aforeſaid,
and others his Neighbours, and made
them more careful of their Tongues.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi>
whoſe Genius was turned for Trade, and
who underſtood it better than Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> or
any of them, being convinc'd that the
Partnerſhip with Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was well-grounded,
and that it was calculated for
the general Good, not of himſelf only,
but of his Partner <hi>Harry Wooll-pack,</hi> and
all his Dependants, he reſolved to regard
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0435900500:53"/>
none of them, but to go on ſteadily in
his Deſign of making the Partnerſhip
EFFECTUAL.</p>
            <p>But the Alderman knowing what ſort
of People he had to do with and what
he was to expect from them afterwards;
that he might leave them without Excuſe,
reſolved to have their own Teſtimonials
to what he was doing; and therefore long

his Intention of entering into Partnerſhip

of the ſame, whether they thought it
might be for the Publick Advantage or
no; particularly and expreſly deſiring
them, if they had any Objections to make,
or any thing to propoſe for their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the ſaid Trade and Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> that they would

before the Partnerſhip was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and particularly their Opinions as
to the Trade it ſelf, after it ſhould be
agreed, whether it was for the Publick
Advantage or no.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this, <hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> in
particular, and all the reſt alſo, however
they have been miſguided ſince, ſent up
long Memorials and Repreſentations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
their full Satisfaction in the ſaid
Partnerſhip, and propoſing ſuch and ſuch
Alterations and Additions as they thought
neceſſary to be provided againſt, altered
or added; upon doing whereof, <hi>they all</hi>
gave it under their hands, that the ſaid
<hi>Partnerſhip</hi> would be very advantageous
to them, and that a Trade with Count
<hi>Tariff</hi> had been <hi>before,</hi> and would be <hi>again,</hi>
with ſuch Regulations, a very beneficial
Trade to them and all their Neighbours:
Which Memorials and Repreſentations,
under their Hands, are yet to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to their Faces, when occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>As
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> was thus confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Opinion of the Goodneſs of
his Deſign, not only by his own Judgment,
but by the ſaid Memorials and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations
of <hi>Harry Woollpack,</hi> and all his
Friends, he gave Count <hi>Tariff</hi> an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0435900500:55"/>
to come over to <hi>England,</hi> in order to
have the Partnerſhip conſummated, and
the Articles MADE EFFECTUAL,
who accordingly arrived here the 31ſt
Day of <hi>March</hi> laſt, being the ſame Day
that Sir <hi>Pol</hi> laid the Plan in the Club for
his Deſtruction, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the <hi>Count</hi> arrived, but the
Club began to put their Meaſures, <hi>which they
had reſolved on,</hi> in Execution: And FIRST,
In order to make the Affair of the ſaid
Partnerſhip a <hi>Party-Cauſe,</hi> they railed at
him as a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and cauſed a Report
to be ſpread all over the Kingdom, that
he had brought the <hi>Pretender</hi> with him,
and particularly they took care to make
<hi>Harry Woollpack</hi> really believe it; which
was the firſt beginning of the Breach on
that Side.</p>
            <p>The poor <hi>Count,</hi> who never knew what
<hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi> meant, and was of no Party,
but for the Univerſal Good of Mankind,
was ſurprized to hear them call him a <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobite,</hi>
and askt, <hi>What Trade that was?</hi>
               <q rend="inline">'He told them, he never concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with Government, it was his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
always to ſubmit to the legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Country he was in,
to pay Cuſtoms and Duties chearfully,
and not only to augment the Revenues
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0435900500:56"/>
of the Princes who Reigned, but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
and enable their People to pay chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and willingly whatever the Laws
obliged them to; that it was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Cuſtom to acknowledge the Power,
but never concerned himſelf about the
Perſons Reigning, much leſs about thoſe
who ſhould or ſhould not ſucceed;
and that for being a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> he knew
nothing of it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let the <hi>Count</hi> ſay what he would,
it was to no purpoſe, Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and his
Club had Voted it, and the Cry was gone
out into the Country, that Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
was come over with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and had brought over the <hi>Pretender,</hi>
nay, and that he was actually lodged in
<hi>Somerſet-houſe:</hi> The Deſign of this was to
have the <hi>Count</hi> Mobb'd and torn to pieces
in the Street; <hi>or elſe,</hi> which would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<hi>Mynheer Coopmanſchap</hi>'s end better,
that he ſhould be terrified with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of it, and ſhould be obliged
to retire with him to <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they were diſappointed in the firſt
part of their Project, for the <hi>Count</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that he was a Person wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in Matters of Trade, and in them
only; and that he deſired to have no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0435900500:57"/>
other Buſineſ, here; the <hi>Alderman</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
him from the Mob, and from the
fury of Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> and alſo cleared up his
Character, as to <hi>Jacobitiſm,</hi> well enough.</p>
            <p>The Party then finding themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to hurt the <hi>Count</hi> this way, apply
themſelves to their OTHER METHOD,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) To attack his Character, as to
Trade; and here indeed they met with
better Succeſs, tho' it was by the help
of the moſt ſcandalous Methods, and the
unjuſt Practices in the World, as will
appear in the ſequel of our Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>To enter into the better Deſcription of
theſe things, we muſt go back to the
<hi>Club,</hi> and to Sir <hi>Pol</hi> their Director: Sir
<hi>Pol,</hi> who is naturally Cholerick, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably
revengeful, having been heated
with the Diſappointment he had received,
<hi>as above,</hi> and not being able to get the
<hi>Count</hi> Mobb'd for a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and for
bringing over the <hi>Pretender;</hi> he called <hi>a
Club</hi> on a <hi>Saturday</hi> Night late, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the Aſſembly in a great Paſſion,
told them, the Alderman had baſely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> by Authority; and that
he believed that even the LANDLADY
her ſelf was a <hi>Jacobite;</hi> and he did not
queſtion but the <hi>Pretender</hi> might have
been found hid under Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s Cloak,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0435900500:58"/>
or was pack'd up in his Equipage, if
the Officers might have ſearched him;
whereas Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> had forbidden
them to Affront him; but that he had
been even both with the <hi>Alderman</hi> and
the <hi>Landlady</hi> too for that, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Care they ſhould be both Expoſed
for it over the whole Nation; and upon
this he called for the <hi>Scots</hi> Pampleeter
who pulled out two Printed Ballads,
which, he ſaid, would do their Buſineſs;
one was <hi>The Merchant Alamode;</hi> the other
<hi>The Ambaſſadreſſes Speech,</hi> which he gave
about to the whole Club, and ordered
Copies to be diſtributed to <hi>Harry Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack</hi>
and his Friends, by the Printer to the
Society.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was true,</hi> that thoſe Wicked Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and his Fraternity, did
a little ſtagger <hi>Harry Woollpack</hi> and his
Friends, ſo that they began to decline the
Partnerſhip which Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> had
made, and ſent up Letters and Addreſſes to
the <hi>Alderman,</hi> not to go on with it; and
made ſome Clamours againſt making it
EFFECTUAL, as ſhall be ſhewn in its
place; which Proceedings occaſioned ſome
delay in the Matter at firſt, but their Eyes
were ſoon opened, and they were all
convinced of their Miſtake at laſt; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0435900500:59"/>
tho' 'tis true it was too late to retrieve
the firſt Damages of the thing, yet it
taught them to know Sir <hi>Pol</hi> a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they did before, and to have a
care of him accordingly; which tended,
in the end, to the Effectual ſettling the
Affair. But to return to Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and the
Club.</p>
            <p>The Club received his laſt Harangue
with great Satisfaction, and were more
eſpecially diverted with the Ballads; for
any thing that affronted their <hi>Landlady</hi>
was always agreeable to the Club: But
their Mirth was almoſt ſpoiled by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Motion, made by one of their own
Body, <hi>tho' Innocently,</hi> for he was as much a
well-wiſher to Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and to his Country's
diſorder, as any of them, but was not
let into the whole Secrets of Management,
and did not know that the Work was to
be done <hi>Per fas</hi> aut <hi>Ne fas:</hi> This grave
Citizen was a <hi>Warehouſeman</hi> by Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore mightily concerned
for the Woollen Manufacture, tho' Hiſtory
has not recorded his Name: This Man
ſtanding up in his place, told the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that he approved very well of what
Sir <hi>Pol</hi> had propoſed, as to defaming and
blackning Count <hi>Tariff</hi> and his Adherents,
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Harry Woolpack</hi> and his Friends
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0435900500:60"/>
againſt the propoſed Partnerſhip, and to
raiſe the Mob upon <hi>Count Tariff;</hi> only,
<hi>ſays he,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'I think it would be neceſſary to
get a certain eminent old Citizen,
whom I was formerly acquainted with,
on our Side, in all we do of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
one, ſays he, you have all heard
of, for he fined for Alderman in the time
of Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>French</hi> Trade; and
might be a match for old Alderman
<hi>Traffick,</hi> or any of them, and this is old
Merchant FACT; for, <hi>continues he,</hi> the
Reputation of this old Gentleman is
ſuch, that no Body will queſtion what

great <hi>Nonplus.</hi>'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Motion Sir <hi>Pol</hi> ſtood up, and
firſt looking about to ſee if the Door

what Deputy …….. has propoſed
is very good, and would be to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and I have been trying ſome time

but I muſt tell you <hi>in Confidence,</hi> that he
is gone out of the way, and <hi>I fear</hi> is
gone over to the Enemy, or at leaſt

            </p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>'1. Says he, I own 'tis abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make <hi>Harry Woolpack</hi> and his
People believe that Merchant FACT
is really on our Side; and therefore I
have reſolved to take that part upon
my ſelf, and ſet up a Counterfeit Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
FACT in his room, which I will
ſhow to the Mob, as I find occaſion:
nay, rather than fail, ſays Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> I'll
counterfeit Merchant FACT my ſelf;
indeed I muſt be concealed from thoſe
People's View who are well acquainted
with his Countenance, or with his Mind;
but as to <hi>Harry Woollpack</hi> he will take
any thing we ſay to him upon Truſt;
and we have nothing to do, as to him,
but to ſay we have got Merchant FACT
on our Side, and he will preſently cry
out of all that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> and his
Friends can ſay, that <hi>it is all Lyes,</hi> and
therefore, if you pleaſe, leave this to my
Management; it is but putting a good
Face to it: I make no queſtion, but
we ſhall carry it as well, as if we had
Merchant FACT along with us, for
Noiſe and Falſhood, at this time of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0435900500:62"/>
Day, will with good Management go
as far as Fact and Truth can do.'</p>
               <p>'2. To carry on this Diſguiſe with the
greater certainty of Succeſs, continues
he, I have found out an excellent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant,
and one that ſtood a faſt Friend
to me, in former Days, when the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
our Anceſtors had juſt ſuch another
Game to play upon King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
               <p>This Aſſiſtant, <hi>ſays he,</hi> has miſled the
City theſe thirty Years with ſuch Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
and ſuch admirable Succeſs, that
no Body has diſcovered or detected him
yet, having thirteen or fourteen Hands
of the principal Merchants of <hi>London,</hi>
to a Certificate of his Integrity in the
Year 1674; theſe he drew in at that
time, without any enquiry, to Vouch
for him, taking all he ſaid upon Truſt:
And that I may hold you in ſuſpence
no longer, this is the famous SCHEME
OF TRADE brought up with old
<hi>Whiſton,</hi> the Devil's Broker, and as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
a Lvar as ever his Maſter was.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Aſſembly received this Propoſal of
Sir <hi>Pol</hi>'s with a general Approbation, and
recommended to him the neceſſary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch:
In the mean time, Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
began to appear abroad again, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>Traffick</hi> declared that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0435900500:63"/>
into Partnerſhip with him, and
that he had reſolved to apply to the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady</hi>
to have the Articles of the ſaid Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
MADE EFFECTUAL by Law.</p>
            <p>Now was Sir <hi>Pol</hi> to play his Game, or
never, for Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> puſhed on
his Deſign to a Hearing, before ſuch Judges
as the LANDLADY had directed it to
be laid before; wherefore, <hi>in the Firſt
place,</hi> Sir <hi>Pol</hi> attacks him with publick
Defamation, <hi>as was agreed before,</hi> and
ſpread a thouſand Clandeſtine Stories
about of his Behaviour; as that he was
Clandeſtinely run away from his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
abroad, that he had broke his
word there, and never kept his Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
with any Body; ſo that there was
no depending upon any thing he ſaid;
that he was a Bankrupt, and had not
paid his Debts, and therefore it was not
ſafe to enter into any Treaty of Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
with him; that he pretended
to come hither for Trade, and to buy
a great many Woollen Manufactures,
but that his Deſign was of another kind;
that he was no Friend to Trade at all,
but a meer <hi>Papiſh,</hi> and a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> and
had a Deſign to bring in the <hi>Pretender;</hi>
that he intended not to buy any of
our Manufactures, and was ſo far from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0435900500:64"/>
wanting Woollen Manufactures at
home, that he was the Inventor and
Encourager of that new Invention among
his own Tenants, of making <hi>fine</hi> Goods
of <hi>coarſe</hi> Wooll, as aboveſaid; and of
making ſundry Woollen Manufactures
without any Wooll AT ALL; in
which he had made a very conſiderable
Progreſs; now tho' among Merchants,
this way of Defaming a Man, is very
Barbarous and Infamous alſo, yet Count
<hi>Tariff</hi> bore it without any Concern, and
went on with his Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> and his Party, then finding
this would not do neither, and that <hi>Count
Tariff</hi>'s Reputation was ſo clear, that if
they did not find out ſome other way to
Ruin him, he would not carry his Point;
they reſolved to ſpring their <hi>laſt Mine,</hi>
and blow him up at once; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
OLD SCHEME, the Fellow men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before; who, <hi>as above,</hi> had lived
ſeveral Years by Cheating, and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
Names, making falſe Accounts,
forming Abſtracts of the Cuſtom-Houſe
Books, <hi>and the like,</hi> is brought out to act
his part upon Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> to get him
Indicted for a Cheat, and ſo they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to bring him to a Tryal. This old
<hi>Knight of the Poſt</hi> having his Leſſon given
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0435900500:65"/>
him, alledged, that the <hi>Count</hi> came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſell his Goods for ready Mony,
and carry it away in Specie, contrary to
the Act of Parliament in that Caſe made
and provided; that he had Contracted to
turn OWLER, and carry away our Wooll
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmanufactured</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> that all the
Accounts given by Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> of the
large Commiſſions the <hi>Count</hi> had brought
from <hi>France,</hi> for buying <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Manufactures, was a meer Cheat;
that he had 25 Ships already upon the
Coaſt loaden with Wine and Brandy,
which muſt be all paid for in Mony, the
Bills being drawn already, and accepted;
that he was in a Plot to introduce the
French Wines to be the common Draught,
inſtead of <hi>neat-Port,</hi> contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of our <hi>Soveraign Lord the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
and to poiſon us all with <hi>French</hi> Brandy;
our own Malt Spirits being known to be
much wholſomer.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other heinous Crimes,
being laid to Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s Charge
by this ſuborner old SCHEME,
they puſhed on the Proceſs, and got
Count TARIFF arraigned for a Cheat,
in the Name, and at the Suit of <hi>Henry
Woollpack</hi> and Company; tho' without
their actual Conſent too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0435900500:66"/>
The <hi>Count,</hi> who knew his own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
did not queſtion but in ſuch a
Religious Nation as this was fam'd to be,
he ſhould have Juſtice done him; and
therefore tho' he might have pleaded <hi>to
the Juriſdiction of the Court,</hi> as having
entered into a Partnerſhip, which thoſe
who contracted it with him, were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
impowered</hi> by their own <hi>Natural
Right</hi> to engage in; and that without
giving an Account to any Body; <hi>and
tho' alſo</hi> he might have pleaded the Law
of Nations for Protection; yet waving
all theſe things, he frankly offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Court, and deſired to be
brought <hi>to Tryal,</hi> which accordingly was
done.</p>
            <p>Upon his Tryal, the uſual Forms ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
paſſed, and <hi>the Charge</hi> being read,
the firſt thing that gave the Court ſome
Diverſion, was the detecting Sir <hi>Pol;</hi>
for he had Diſguiſed himſelf, and appeared
in Court under the Name of MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHANT
FACT; but as he was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
the old Man, and endeavouring
alſo to ſpeak as if he had loſt his Teeth,
that he might conceal the Heſitations
which <hi>want of Truth</hi> obliged him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to make; by great Misfortune,
all on a ſudden his FALSE BEARD <hi>fell
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0435900500:67"/>
off,</hi> this made him be more ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and ſome Perſons in Court, who
formerly had ſome Acquaintance with the
real Merchant FACT, ſpoke openly,
and offered to prove that this was not the
Man; upon which all the honeſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that ſtood by, hiſſed at him moſt
intolerably; and if ever he could have
Bluſhed in his Life, it was thought it
would have been at this time.</p>
            <p>Tho' he found himſelf thus detected, yet
wanting no Aſſurance, he turned it off with
a ready ſhift, that indeed he was not Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
FACT of <hi>London,</hi> but he was Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
FACT of <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
he ſaid, that if he was a true FACT,
the Difference of City-Fact or Country-FACT
would not be much.</p>
            <p>The Court allowed that in his favour,
and then put him to the proof of what
he had ſaid, for which he appealed all
along to his FACT-OR old <hi>Scheme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Charge being read, and all
Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and his Voucher <hi>old Scheme</hi> had to
ſay, being heard with the utmoſt patience
by the Court; Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was allowed
to ſpeak for himſelf.</p>
            <p>He ſpoke with great Modeſty of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
He ſaid, <q rend="inline">'That he was no Cheat,

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0435900500:68"/>
always been a Friend to the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Commerce, and that he had been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in his own Country on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
that he came to reſide here
for the Benefit of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> that he
could have had very advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
if he would have joined with
<hi>Mynheer van Coopmanſchap,</hi> and never have
come here at all; and that he could ſtill
be very well received, if he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with him, inſtead of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchants; that he was ſo far from
being in Debt abroad, that on the
contrary, <hi>Mynheer van Coopmanſchap</hi> owed

he was ready to prove it by his Books;
but that he feared very much he ſhould

               <q rend="inline">'<hi>He told them,</hi> that conſidering how

meet with ſuch Treatment: That he
expected better Uſage; that he had
been promiſed he ſhould be Amicably
received when he came hither, and
that by ſome who <hi>he ſaw</hi> appeared very
warm againſt him now, and who he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0435900500:69"/>
took for Men of more Honour.'</q> This
Reflected upon <hi>Harry Woollpack</hi> and his
Friends who indeed began to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> and to ſneak away one

            <p>
               <hi>He went on</hi> to Complain, <q rend="inline">'That the

            </p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>'Then, a to OLD SCHEME, <hi>he
ſaid,</hi> he was an Upſtart that indeed he

that he had practiſed thoſe things ever

ſince the Year 1674. and he deſired he
might call his Witneſſes to this.'</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Court was very much moved at
this Diſcourſe, and readily gave the
<hi>Count</hi> leave to call his Witneſſes, which
made every Body believe that he would
carry his Cauſe, and indeed Sir <hi>Pol</hi>'s
Friends began to deſpair for him; for
the <hi>Count</hi> in the firſt place produced a
whole Cart-load of Books, Draughts, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and other Papers from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe,
with the proper Officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
to Vouch their being Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and the Commiſſioners Hands to
them; upon Examining whereof, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
that OLD SCHEME had really
drawn falſe Accounts, counterfeited the
Names who he had pretended had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
them, and that none of all the
Accounts he had produced, agreed with
the Originals in the Cuſtom-houſe
Books; from whence he pretended he had
copied them.</p>
            <p>This cauſed the Court very much to
reſent the Uſage they had met with from
the old Knave, and ſome Authors affirm,
that it was moved he ſhould be expoſed,
and his Accounts burnt by the Hangman;
but the turn that afterwards happened to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0435900500:71"/>
theſe things, ſaved him from receiving his
juſt Reward <hi>at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This put Sir <hi>Pol</hi>'s Party into a great
Conſternation: But Sir <hi>Pol,</hi> who never
was at a loſs, produced in the next place,
a great Number of Petitions from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and City, <hi>the firſt</hi> procured by the
two <hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> Factors, formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
Theſe had ſent blank Petitions of
their own drawing up, to <hi>Harry Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack</hi>'s
Friends all over <hi>England,</hi> telling the
Country Clothiers by Letters, that if they
did not Sign them they were undone; and
their Trade would be all given away to
<hi>France; the laſt</hi> was from the Weavers
and Companies in <hi>London,</hi> procured by
the ſame Sollicitation, and moſt of the ſaid
laſt Petitions having the ſame Hands to
them all.</p>
            <p>Againſt theſe, Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> produced a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Repreſentations from all parts

formerly mentioned, entreating him
to invite Count <hi>Tariff</hi> over hither, and to
engage in Partnerſhip with him; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their great Satisfaction, and how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
it would be to the Nation, if
he could be prevailed upon to become
Partner with <hi>Harry Woolpack</hi> and himſelf,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0435900500:72"/>
as aforeſaid; repreſenting alſo what an
advantageous Trade <hi>Great-Britain</hi> enjoyed
formerly, when the old real Merchant
FACT, and the <hi>Count</hi> correſponded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
And that which was moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
in this part of the <hi>Count</hi>'s Defence
was, that many of theſe Petitions and
Repreſentations were from the very ſame
Places, and Signed by the very ſame
Hands which had Signed Sir <hi>Pol</hi>'s Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) from <hi>Harry Woollpack</hi> and his

procured the <hi>firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Pol</hi> finding that it thus went
againſt him, and that he was in danger
of loſing his Cauſe, had got one Card left
to play, which indeed carried the whole
Cauſe, and ruined all the Meaſures which
<hi>Alderman Traffick</hi> had laid for making this
Partnerſhip EFFECTUAL; and this was
to bring a MOB and make a Tumult
round about the Court; Theſe <hi>old Scheme</hi>
had prepared for his Attendants, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Harry Woollpack</hi>'s Servants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants,
tho' their Maſter was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
as before, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Cloth-workers,
Dyers, Packers, Calenders, Setters, Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſers,
<hi>Blackwell-Hall</hi> FACT-ORS, with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0435900500:73"/>
their Apprentices. Porters, Carmen, and
whatever Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and <hi>Scheme</hi> by their
mighty Intereſt could get together. Theſe
raiſed a Hubbub without the Court,
crying out, no Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> no <hi>Tariff;</hi>
ſend away Count <hi>Tariff!</hi> Let the <hi>Dutch</hi>
or the Devil have Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> and
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> too, we care not; no
TARIFF, no TARIFF; likewiſe all the
while the Court were conſidering of the
Caſe, and preparing to give their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and <hi>old Scheme,</hi> who had
now no other Game to play, and were
at their Wits end, interrupted them with
a hideous Noiſe and Clamour; crying no
<hi>Tariff,</hi> no <hi>Tariff;</hi> nay, ſome it ſeems cryed,
no <hi>Trade,</hi> no <hi>Tariff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, <hi>as Noiſe generally does in the like
Caſes,</hi> was ſaid to have influenced many,
whether it intimidated any or no, Hiſtory
is ſilent as to that; but Sir <hi>Pol</hi> ſaw evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that it had turned the Scale very
much on his Side: At length a certain
<hi>Suffolk Gentleman</hi> then in Court, deſired
leave to offer an Expedient to appeaſe
the preſent Tumult, and ſatisfy all Parties;
which having been granted, he began to
ſpeak He acknowledged, <q rend="inline">'<hi>That</hi> he had
been as forward as any for the <hi>Count</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
over; he ſaid, <hi>that</hi> he was ſtill of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0435900500:74"/>
Opinion, that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was capable
of laying a good Foundation for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
the Tricks and Forgeries of Sir
<hi>Pol,</hi> and his Sham-Evidence <hi>Old Scheme,</hi>
as much as any one did; <hi>that</hi> he had
given his Aſſiſtance in drawing the
Partnerſhip now in Debate, and did
think the Articles of it were a ſufficient
Ground to eſtabliſh the Commerce of
the Nation upon: <hi>But that,</hi> in regard
the Noiſe was ſo great, and the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
without doors ſo loud, <hi>that</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Count nor his Witneſſes could
be heard; and that the Term being now
expiring, <hi>the Court</hi> could not ſit long
enough to determine a thing of ſo great
Conſequence; he propoſed therefore <hi>that</hi>
Perſons might be choſen on both ſides,
and appointed <hi>to adjuſt ſuch Matters as were
not fully ſettled,</hi> and to <hi>explain the ſeveral
Meanings</hi> of both ſides; ſo that <hi>an entire
Scheme of the Trade,</hi> which Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
propoſed, <hi>might be framed, which might
fully anſwer the good Intentions of the
LANDLADY for the Good and Welfare
of her Tenants:</hi> And that to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the Debate about confirming the
Articles of the Partnerſhip with Count
<hi>Tariff,</hi> and making the ſame EFFEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUAL,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0435900500:75"/>
might be delayed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
to be reaſſumed the firſt Cauſe
next <hi>Michaelmas-Term,</hi> and then to be
fully diſcuſſed, try'd and determined,
by a Jury of <hi>Landed-Men,</hi> to be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by all the High Sheriffs of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi>
and that in the mean time Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
might be given, that the Court
might be impoſed upon by no more
Counterfeits, no more Goodman FACTS,
but that the true Merchant FACT of
<hi>London</hi> might be found out, and deſired
to appear; to whom all due Reſpect,
Honour and Regard, ſhould be ſhewn
by the Court.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, after ſome Debate, being put to
the Queſtion, and carry'd by a Majority
of nine Voices, the Cauſe was put off
accordingly.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Mynheer <hi>Van Coopmanſchap,</hi>
who lay all this while concealed at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lawyer's Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi>
had an Account of this Succeſs, he came
down to the Club with great Joy, having
firſt, by Advice of Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his Acquaintance, ſent ſeveral
Loads of Fagots to <hi>Baſinghall-ſtreet, Spittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,
Ludgate-bill,</hi> and other convenient
Places, to make Bonfires and pleaſe their
Mob.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0435900500:76"/>
Being come into the Club, <q rend="inline">'he return'd
them his hearty Thanks for the great
Service they had done him, which he
aſſured them he would endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
upon all occaſions; if they ſhould
have any need of him, whether upon
falling out with their LANDLADY,
or in whatever Buſineſs, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his Aſſiſtance.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He told them,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">'He hop'd they would
continue the ſame Care for his Affairs,
againſt the next Term; and eſpecially,
to provide good Advocates to plead for
him: He likewiſe told them, he doubted
not but he ſhould renew his Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with Count <hi>Tariff</hi> the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for he was a Perſon that could not
be out of Buſineſs:'</q> And ſo making a
<hi>very low Bow,</hi> he offered to take his Leave.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Pol</hi> making a Sign to him to
ſtay, ſtood up, and ſpoke to him to the
following Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He told him,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">
                  <p>The Society was very
glad they had been ſerviceable to him
in this Affair; that they were well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that he ſhould enter into the
Partnerſhip with Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> as he
deſired, tho' thereby he ſhould engroſs
all the Trade to himſelf; that they
would not fail to uſe their Intereſt, to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0435900500:77"/>
get him good Lawyers to plead for him
againſt next Term; and particularly he
told him, that they would uſe their
Endeavours to get the High Sheriffs to
return him a good Jury, who ſhould
be as willing to give up the Trade of
the Kingdom to him as the Club had
been; which, he ſaid, required a great
deal of Art and good Management on
their part to bring to paſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He put him in mind however,</hi> That the
Club had pawn'd their Credit with
<hi>Harry Wool-pack</hi> and his Friends in the
Country, and with all the Mob that
they had gotten together to make a
Noiſe for him: that he (<hi>Mynheer</hi>) and
his Partners in <hi>Holland,</hi> would take off
all their Woollen Manufactures and Fiſh;
and, that they ſhould have no Loſs by
their refuſing the Partnerſhip with
Count <hi>Tariff:</hi> which if <hi>I</hi> had not done,
<hi>ſays Sir Pol,</hi> and my good Friend here
Mr. SCHEME, you had had no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
for you to day, and had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
loſt your Point: And therefore
<hi>Mynheer,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Pol</hi> we hope you will
be as good as your Word, and keep up
our Credit with the Country, without
which we ſhall never be able to get
you a good Jury choſen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0435900500:78"/>
                     <hi>Mynheer</hi> chang'd the Air of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
upon this Propoſal, and told
them <hi>coldly,</hi> he would do them what
Service he could; but that as to the
Fiſh-Trade, it was out of his way to
buy any in <hi>Britain,</hi> he having Ships of
his own with which he could catch them
on our <hi>North-coaſts</hi> ſooner than we did
our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But as to our Woollen Manufactures,
he ſaid he would take a pretty large
Quantity of <hi>Gloceſterſhire-cloths</hi> and <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſerges;</hi>
only he ſaid he muſt have
the Cloths WHITE, and the Serges
in the GREASE, becauſe the Dying,
Dreſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was to be done in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that his own poor Servants might
be employed.'</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſaid thus, he withdrew; and
the next Morning having enter'd into a
Parnerſhip with Count <hi>Tariff, for one
Year certain,</hi> they went away together for
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where, as we are informed,
they drive a very great Trade; and Count
<hi>Tariff,</hi> in particular, has already bought
a very great Quantity of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods
of him, with 20000 Hogſheads of <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland</hi>
Tobacco, and other Goods in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0435900500:79"/>
The Club being thus diſappointed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very much dejected; and we hear
that <hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> and his Friends are
gone home into the Country, in a Fret,
diſoblig'd and diſſatisfied; as they might
very well be, their Manufactures being
thrown back upon their hands by the
<hi>Dutchman</hi> now his own Ends were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Mynheer <hi>Van Coopmanſchap</hi> being gone,
and Count <hi>Tariff</hi> alſo, the Chair-man
thought fit to appoint, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
ſhould meet every Evening to
concert Meaſures for the carrying on the
Intereſt of <hi>Mynheer,</hi> according to their
Promiſe; and to oppoſe every one that
in the leaſt countenanced the Partnerſhip
with Alderman <hi>Traffick:</hi> And to the end
that this might be done more effectually,
Sir <hi>Pol</hi> propoſed, that they ſhould ſend
for their Scots Pamphleteer, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done them very good Service in
frequent publiſhing their Scandals, and
who being lately fled from Juſtice, had
been entertained in <hi>Coopmanſchap</hi>'s Family
abroad. This was no ſooner agreed to,
but the Fugitive appeared in the Club,
having been lurking about the Town for
ſome time; and was ſet immediately to
work to write Pamphlets in Favour of
Mynheer <hi>Coopmanſchap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0435900500:80"/>
It cannot be expected we can collect all
the ſcurrilous Invectives which Hiſtory has
given an Account of, that were written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Occaſion, as well againſt Count
<hi>Tariff,</hi> as againſt the LANDLADY her
ſelf; the firſt were eſpecially directed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the People to the breaking off the
Partnerſhip between Count <hi>Tariff</hi> and
Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> and to inflame <hi>Harry
Wooll-pack</hi> again; ſo that inſtead of being
ſenſible of his Loſs, and the Injury done
to his Trade, he ſhould like well to have
all the Buſineſs go through old <hi>Coopman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchap</hi>'s
Hands, and himſelf be a <hi>Jack-hold-my-ſtaff</hi>
to the <hi>Dutch-man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the more difficult for them
to effect, becauſe <hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> had
been ſo ill uſed by <hi>Mynheer,</hi> and had
ſeen ſo much of his Knavery in the <hi>late
Tryal;</hi> eſpecially when the pretended Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
FACT's falſe Beard <hi>dropt off,</hi> and
diſcover'd him to be no FACT, but meer
<hi>Sir Pol Falſhood,</hi> diſguiſed in the Habit of
the true Merchant FACT; that he
was gone down in the Country diſguſted,
and had openly ſaid, they were a Pack
of Knaves; and, that he would never
have any more to do with them; that
they were in a Confederacy with <hi>Old
Coopmanſchap,</hi> to enrich him at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0435900500:81"/>
of their Country, and to let him
make a Monopoly of the Engliſh Trade.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Pol</hi> was not ignorant, that it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary, in order to prevent their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Deſign, that they ſhould bring over this
<hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> again; and to this end,
they were to ſet all their Engines at work
to blow Duſt into his Eyes, that he ſhould
not ſee too far into their Meaſures. The
Methods they took for this, as is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are too many to be inſerted in this
place; but the Hiſtories of thoſe Times
cannot fail to ſupply the Want. It may
ſuffice to let the Reader know, that this
was diligently endeavoured by charging
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> with the Breach of a
Partnerſhip he had been engaged in with
<hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Merchant, and
with threatning what a great Damage it
would be to <hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> if <hi>Don Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian</hi>
ſhould take the Pett, and refuſe to
Trade with him and his Friends; altho'
it was well known that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> had
no other Market for his own Goods, nor
could he be ſupplied any other way with
ſuch Goods as <hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> Traded
in; and beſides all that, <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi>
was ſo Embarraſſed, with reference to
a neighbouring Merchant, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
great Arrears from him, of an
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0435900500:82"/>
old Contract that was between them,
which amounted to more than the ſaid
<hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was able to pay; that he
was fain to make uſe of Alderman <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
and his Intereſt, to prevent a very
great Suit at <hi>Law</hi> being commenc'd againſt
him; and it was very improbable that he
would do any thing ſo very affronting to
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> as what theſe Men
talked of, at the ſame time that he was
ſo much obliged to him other ways.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſaw
that there was ſo much Neceſſity for
what Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> had done, with
reſpect to ſome Particulars of their Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip,
that he appeared very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
therewith, and did not pretend to
take any Step that look'd as if there was
any Unkindneſs between them: So that
all the Clamour on that ſide ceaſed, and
<hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> very freely offered to renew
his Partnerſhip with Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi>
upon Terms of Friendſhip, and good
Correſpondence, and to Trade together
as much as ever they did. On the other
hand, Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> eſpouſed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> ſo heartily and ſo
effectually, being made Arbitrator between
him and his Neighbour <hi>Don Philippo</hi> the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchant, that he got that Breach
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0435900500:83"/>
amicably made up, and a chargeable Suit
at Law, which he was threatned with,
effectually prevented.</p>
            <p>This was ſuch a piece of Service to
<hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> and he being a Perſon of
great Honour and Gratitude, was made
ſo ſenſible of it, that it prevented all
manner of Miſunderſtanding between
him and Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> to the great
Mortification of Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and his Friends,
who had made a mighty great Noiſe of
this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Being diſappointed in their Meaſures
in this Particular, and not able to bring
over <hi>Harry Wooll-pack,</hi> as they deſigned to
do, to their Party; the next thing they
went about was, to ſee what they were
able to do as to getting a pack'd Jury
againſt Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s Tryal came on.</p>
            <p>Writing Pamphlets, and filling the
Country with moſt abominable Untruths,
Scandal, Slander, and falſe Rumours, to
make the People uneaſy, this was their
ſtated never-failing Method; but the
main Point was, to bring the Character
of Count <hi>Tariff</hi> into Contempt; to which
nothing was wanting, that could poſſibly
be done by Men who neither valued their
own Reputation, or any Man's elſe; nay,
even the LANDLADY her ſelf was in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0435900500:84"/>
a moſt unchriſtian manner inſulted by
their Writers, and treated with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Indecency imaginable, although they
knew her to be the beſt of Landladies,
and though they enjoyed their Shops with
the utmoſt Quiet under her, paying as
little Rent as could be expected; and
although ſhe had ſucceſsfully protected
them againſt all thoſe who would have
diſturbed them.</p>
            <p>Whenever theſe Pamphleteers had
printed any thing that treated their ſaid
LANDLADY either diſreſpectfully or
injuriouſly, or that inſulted her in the
Government of her own Affairs; the
Club induſtriouſly conveyed thoſe Prints
throughout the whole Kingdom, and
ſpread them among all her Tenants and
Servants, in order to accuſtom and inure
them to treat her in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>As to her immediate Servants, they were
treated by theſe People in the moſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
manner imaginable; and upon all
Occaſions ſo ſcurrilouſly and injuriouſly
uſed in their ordinary Buſineſs, and in the
Diſcharge of their Duty to their <hi>Landlady</hi>
and <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> that it look'd not only as if
theſe Men had a Right ſuperior even to
their <hi>Landlady</hi> her ſelf, but that ſhe
was not lawfully Lady of the Manour,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0435900500:85"/>
or were not rightful Poſſeſſor of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements
which ſhe had let to them.</p>
            <p>This they thought was uſeful to awe
and brow-beat thoſe good Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whoſe proper Buſineſs it was to bring
the Names of thoſe Gentlemen to the
High Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who were to return
the Jury by whom Count <hi>Tariff</hi> was to
be tryed.</p>
            <p>But this had a quite contrary Effect;
for when the Country Tenants, eſpecially
<hi>Harry Wooll-pack</hi> and his People, came to
ſee how their good <hi>Landlady</hi> was ſerved,
for whom they had an unſeigned Zeal
and Affection; and upon what Account,
and with what little Reaſon ſhe was ſo
unmannerly and undutifully handled, it
raiſed their Paſſions to the higheſt degree,
and they reſolved to have nothing to do
with Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and his Party.</p>
            <p>This alſo had a good effect the other
way; for, it diſcovered the Deſigns of
Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and his CLUB, and it gave the
People Warning againſt being farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon; by which means there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
a general good Diſpoſition among
them all, to chooſe ſuch a Jury as ſhall
hear the Cauſe of Count <hi>Tariff</hi> with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality,
and that will not be bullied
by Sir <hi>Politick Falſhood</hi> and his <hi>Falſe-beard,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0435900500:86"/>
or be put off from doing Juſtice by the
Noiſe of his Rabble; ſo that there is no
Queſtion but the Partnerſhip between
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> and Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> will
be approved, and the Articles thereof,
upon a fair and full hearing of the Cauſe,
be made EFFECTUAL.</p>

            <p>SInce the aforeſaid Memoirs were
written, we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that there are divers Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
come from abroad, of the great
Joy which the rejecting Count <hi>Tariff</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> had occaſioned in <hi>France,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
among the Manufacturers of Woollen
Goods in the ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Languedoc,
Pictou, Anjou,</hi> &amp;c. where upon the firſt
News of the Treaty of a Partnerſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Count <hi>Tariff;</hi> and <hi>Harry Woollpack,</hi>
Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> and others in <hi>London,</hi>
the People were under the greateſt Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
imaginable; knowing that if that
<hi>Partnerſhip</hi> went on, and ſhould be made
EFFECTUAL by Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi>'s
<hi>Landlady;</hi> and that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> had come
off at his Tryal with that Applauſe which
they heard was expected, their ſeveral
Undertakings of Woollen Manufactures
in thoſe Places would be ruined.</p>
            <p>They had repreſented this before to
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> himſelf, humbly Addreſſing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0435900500:88"/>
and Entreating him not to enter into
Partnerſhip with Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> for
that it would be to the ruin of his own
Country if he did: They alſo applyed
themſelves to their own <hi>Landlord,</hi> to try
if he could be prevailed upon to prevent
Count <hi>Tariff</hi> from entering into any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
which would be ſo fatal to all
his Tenants.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Landlord</hi>'s Circumſtances were
at that time ſuch, that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
interpoſe in the Matter; for
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi>'s <hi>Landlady,</hi> and he, had
newly ended a long and chargeable SUIT
at LAW, and being made Friends, he
was unwilling to Diſoblige her, tho' he
complyed with Conditions, which at other
Times he would not have done; nor had
the Partnerſhip with Count <hi>Tariff</hi> ever
been made upon ſuch advantageous Terms,
if it had not been ſo.</p>
            <p>Being thus repulſed by their <hi>Landlord,</hi>
the poor Manufacturers had no recourſe
but to Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> entreating him not
to engage with Alderman <hi>Traffick,</hi> and
repreſenting that it would be their utter
ruin, <hi>if they did;</hi> that they ſhould never
get any WOOLL to go on with their
Manufactures, and without which it was
impoſſible for them to carry on their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0435900500:89"/>
Trade: They knew, <hi>they ſaid,</hi> that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
<hi>Traffick,</hi> and his Partner <hi>Harry
Woollpack,</hi> were utter Enemies to them
and to their Employment, and would
Effectually put a ſtop to their having any
Wooll from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they ſhould be all undone;
whereas thoſe People who had managed
the Trade in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> formerly, were
very eaſie in that Affair, and at leaſt
were ſlack in preventing the Exportation
of their Wooll; ſo that they could get over
whatever Quantity they had occaſion
for.</p>
            <p>They farther repreſented to him, that
if he went on with this Partnerſhip, it
would bring in ſuch a prodigious Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
upon them; and that ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any they could make at home,
that no one would buy their Goods made
in <hi>France:</hi> As to the high Duties which
they were informed he would take off,
they repreſented, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
would not only be better than
theirs, but would thereby be <hi>cheaper alſo;</hi> for
that notwithſtanding their People worked
as cheap, and fared as hard as any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the World, yet they were but
young, and unexperienced in the Trade,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0435900500:90"/>
and had not the Arts of doing every
thing ſo at firſt hand, as the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Nor
had they Materials as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had,
but at very remote diſtances, and upon
much dearer Terms than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had;
ſo that AS it had been impoſſible for them
to ſet up their ſeveral Manufactures, if
it had not been for Count <hi>Tariff</hi>'s break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off his former Partnerſhips in <hi>Britain,</hi>
in the Years 1667, 1687, and 1701, by
which the Markets were their own, and
they were admitted to ſell at what Price
they pleaſed; SO it would be impoſſible
for them to go on with any Succeſs, if he
ſhould renew his ſaid Buſineſs; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
anew with the ſaid <hi>Traffick</hi> and
<hi>Woollpack,</hi> who were ſworn Enemies to
their Trade.</p>
            <p>Theſe Repreſentations, however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,
and made by vaſt Numbers
of the ſaid <hi>Count</hi>'s Tenants and Servants,
yet could not prevail with the <hi>Count</hi> at
all; eſpecially when Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi>'s
<hi>Landlady</hi> interpoſed her good Offices to
have the Partnerſhip agreed on; <hi>ſo that</hi>
as you have heard the Affair went on
ſucceſsfully, and the Partnerſhip was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
only that it wanted ſome Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to make the ſame EFFECTUAL
among <hi>Harry Woollpack</hi>'s Friends, and
others, as has been ſhewn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0435900500:91"/>
The poor Manufacturers being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed,
were driven even to Deſpair, and
had no remedy but Prayers and Tears,
for they are not ſuch noiſie Fellows as
our Sir <hi>Pol</hi> and old <hi>Scheme</hi> brought along
with them to the Parliament: They dare
not come up with their Mob at their heels,
and interrupt the Aſſembly and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Country, with their Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and Cries of <hi>no Tariff!</hi> no <hi>Tariff!</hi>
no <hi>Engliſh Partnerſhip!</hi> and the like; but
ſeeing the ſame like to go on, they ſat down
with a profound Submiſſion to their <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,</hi>
but at the ſame time crying uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
to one another, that they were all
undone, and their Trade ruined.</p>
            <p>As their Grief was inexpreſſible at the
proſpect of the opening of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Commerce into <hi>France,</hi> ſo when they
underſtood how things were like to go
in <hi>England,</hi> they began to revive in
their Hopes; and having their truſty
Agents in the Club in ſelf, at <hi>London,</hi>
by whom they had Intelligence every
Poſt, how things went on, thoſe
Agents did not fail to puſh forwards Sir
<hi>Pol</hi> and the <hi>Club,</hi> to inſult Count <hi>Tariff</hi>
as much as poſſible, and in order to this,
they ſcattered about private Papers, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
that Count <hi>Tariff</hi> had little or
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0435900500:92"/>
no Influence on the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
in his own Country; that they
were now come to that Perfection, that
they valued <hi>no Engliſh</hi> Manufactures <hi>at
all,</hi> but made them better at home;
and were able not only to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but all the World, and even <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Men that put it into
Sir <hi>Pol</hi>'s Head, to impoſe a diſtracted
Notion upon the Club, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That
there was a Project ſet up in <hi>France</hi> to
make Woollen Manufactures without
WOOLL at all; and thus they help'd
blow the Coals up in the Club againſt
Count <hi>Tariff;</hi> when, at the ſame time,
they in <hi>France</hi> were in the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
for fear his Articles with
Alderman <hi>Traffick</hi> ſhould be made EF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECTUAL.</p>
            <p>But
it is impoſſible to expreſs the Joy
of the poor People, all over the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Provinces, where the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
are made, when their Agents
in the Club wrote them the following
Letter, which being written in <hi>French,</hi>
we thought fit to Tranſlate for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Publick.</p>

                  <p>WE do our ſelves the Honour to
acquaint you, that we are juſt
now returned from the Aſſembly of
Eſtates of this Country, where the Caſe
of Count <hi>Tariff,</hi> and his new Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
was brought to a Tryal; we have
been aſſiſting in the Club of the City-Malecontents,
<hi>and others,</hi> in raiſing an
hideous outcry in the Streets and outer
Courts of the Parliament, where we
met with a great Number of their
Canaille to ſay, <hi>no Tariff! no Tariff!</hi> which
has had the deſired Succeſs; for the
Court has refuſed to make the ſaid
Partnerſhip EFFECTUAL; and have
put off the Cauſe till the next Meeting:
So, <hi>Meſſieurs,</hi> you are ſecure of enjoying
your Manufactures for one whole Year
longer; and that you may carry them
on the more ſucceſsfully, we have, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Order, bought you a
large parcel of fine Wooll, to be ready,
as uſual, when your Boats ſhall come for
it; which, with what we formerly
Shipp'd off from <hi>Ireland,</hi> will be of
great Service to you.</p>
