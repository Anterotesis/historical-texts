            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BEFORE any juſt Obſervations can be made upon the two Heads which we are now to conſider, it is abſolutely neceſſary to let the Reader a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the general Knowledge of the State of the Commerce between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as it now ſtands; and this cannot be done ſo as to give him a clear Underſtanding in the reading either the Treaty it ſelf, or theſe Conſiderations, without letting him know what the Meaning of the Tariff of 1664, and the Tariff of 1699, ſo often now to be made mention of is, and as far as will conſiſt with the Brevity of this Tract, to give an Abridgement of thoſe Tariffs, as they concern the preſent Treaty of Commerce. The Neceſſity of underſtanding theſe Things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly before we can make any Judgment of the Matter in hand, is ſuch, that it ſeems the moſt natural Introduction that could poſſibly be made to the Work, and without which, however the Book is written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it would be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue to moſt of the Readers, and might as well have been written in <hi>Arabick,</hi> or any other Language or Character which no body could underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0684801900:3"/>
A <hi>TARIFF in the French,</hi> as it may beſt be expounded to us in a Trading-Dialect, is no more or leſs than <hi>a Book of Rates,</hi> eſtabliſhing the Duties and Cuſtoms of Goods exported and imported from and to the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> It is true, if you ſpeak literally, it is the Acts of publick Authority, from whence the Books of Rates are collected, as our <hi>Books of Rates</hi> are, ſo many Abſtracts of the Acts of Parliament, by which thoſe Rates are eſtabliſhe'd; and therefore, as our Laws of Cuſtoms are called Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſo thoſe in <hi>France</hi> are called <hi>Edits du Roy, Declaration du Roy, Ordonnance du Roy, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt du Conſeild' Etat du Roy,</hi> and the like; and the Collection of them into a Body is call'd in <hi>French Recueil des Tarifs,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Table de Tarifs Arreſts &amp; Reglemens des Droits de Entree &amp; Sortie,</hi> &amp;c. that is in <hi>Engliſh a Book of Rates,</hi> and nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a Vulgar Error to think theſe Tariffs are Treaties between <hi>France</hi> and other Nations, and to ſay the Tariff between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> or between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. is to talk Nouſenſe, or which is much the ſame thing, to ſay nothing to the Purpoſe, with this Exception only, That in ſeveral Treaties of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce there have been Agreements made, and Articles enter'd into, eſpecially between <hi>France</hi> and the States-General, by which the Duties of Merchandiſes have been adjuſted reſpectively; and in theſe Treaties the Tariffs in <hi>France,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made, have been made the Foundation, with ſuch particular Additions, reſpecting the Duties of ſuch or ſuch Goods, about which they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0684801900:4"/>
have then treated and made any Alteration. Of this we have an Example; after the Treaty of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> when, by a ſeparate Treaty of Trade, tho' in former Caſes the Duties in general were adjuſted, yet new Agreements were made for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things, the reſt being refer'd to the Tariffs of other Years, and this was called indeed <hi>Tarif Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſte Entre la France &amp; la Hollande:</hi> This was the 8th of <hi>December</hi> 1699.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary farther, as an Introduction to this Diſcourſe, to obſerve that the general Tariffs, or Book of Rates, which have been made and are refer'd to in the preſent Treaties ſtand thus: That of 1664 was the moſt general, in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchandiſes and Manufactures paid, upon their Importation into <hi>France,</hi> very moderate Duties; and particularly of our Woollen Manifactures: Thus, <table>

            <p>And the like of other Merchandiſes. Theſe Duties were enlarg'd in the Year 1699, and by an <hi>Arreſt du Conſeil de Eſtat,</hi> 6. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1701, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Prohibition of our Woollen Manufactures was publiſh'd, and new extravagant Duties laid upon thoſe which were allow'd to be enter'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0684801900:5"/>
Theſe Things being neceſſary to premiſe by way of Introduction on the Side of the <hi>French,</hi> it may ſuffice on the other Part to obſerve, that by ſundry Acts of Parliament made on ſeveral Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and with various Proſpects in <hi>England,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral additional Duties, and ſome Prohibitions have been laid upon and againſt the Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes of the Growth of <hi>France,</hi> beſides the general Prohibition, or final Stop, of Intercourſe, or Commerce between the two Nations, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the Accident of the War.</p>
            <p>As to particular Prohibitions, the chief are thoſe firſt againſt Alamodes and Luſtrings, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Company, who have erected the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of that kind here, and who, if thoſe Prohibitions had not been made could not have ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>Alſo, that for a Prohibition of all wrought Silks, for the Encouragement of the Broad-Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>England,</hi> and without which they muſt have been reduc'd, if not quite ruin'd.</p>
            <p>The high additional Duties were ſuch as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpect the Wines and Brandies imported hither from <hi>France,</hi> which by the ſeveral Acts of Parliament eſtabliſhing thoſe Duties amount at this time as follows:<table>

            <p>Theſe Duties being ſo great as to be equal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a Prohibition, ſtand as an Equivalent to the Impoſitions which the <hi>French</hi> have laid upon ours, and is the Foundation of the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>As our Conſiderations extend to no other Part of the Treaty than what relates to Trade, and to the Duties and Impoſitions upon Merchandiſe, ſo we ſhall confine it according to the Title to the two particular Articles which have made ſo much Noiſe in the Town, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eighth and Ninth Articles.</p>
            <p>The Eighth Article runs thus:<q>Furthermore it is agreed and concluded as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, That all and ſingular the Subjects of the moſt Serene Queen of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and of the moſt Serene the moſt Chriſtian King, in all Countries and Places ſubject to their Power on each Side, as to all Duties, Impoſitions, or Cuſtoms whatſoever, concerning Perſons, Goods and Merchandizes, Ships, Freights, Seamen, Navigation and Commerce, ſhall uſe and enjoy the ſame Privileges, and Immunities at leaſt, and have the like favour in all Things, as well in the Courts of Juſtice, as in all ſuch things as relate either to Commerce, or to any other Right whatever, which any Foreign Nation, the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0684801900:7"/>
has, uſes, and enjoys, or may hereafter have, uſe, and enjoy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Article propoſes an Equality in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circumſtances of Trade for the Subjects of the two Nations, in their reſpective Dominions, with the Subjects of other Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>France</hi> ſhall not demand any Toll, Duty, Cuſtom, Impoſt, Port-Charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, in any Ports or places of her Dominions, more than the Subjects of all other Nations pay in the ſame Ports, and <hi>Vice Verſa England</hi> ſhall do the ſame.</p>
            <p>I know it is objected here that this Article di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contravenes the Treaty with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſome People lay a great Streſs upon that Treaty, in which we are oblig'd to admit the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines at a certain Rate or Duty lower than the <hi>French.</hi> Whether the Parliament will think that Treaty relates to a farther Term than the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the War, I ſhall not determine; and this is named becauſe ſome inſiſt upon it, that that Treaty was made for Conſiderations which wholly related to the War, and which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, or Conditions, on the behalf of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> as has been mention'd in Parliament, were not honourably and punctually perform'd. <hi>Vide the Votes of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Addreſs laſt Seſſion. Now, how far the Queen of <hi>Great Britain</hi> will think Her ſelf bound by that Treaty, which, on the other hand, they ſay, was never perform'd, is the Queſtion theſe People offer in this Caſe: But this I ſhall not take upon me to determine of here, but leave it to the Caſuiſts in thoſe Caſes, whoſe Judgments
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0684801900:8"/>
are founded on the Laws of Nations, and the Nature of Treaties.</p>
            <p>But the Conſiderations of Trade are of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Nature; and tho' there were much more to be ſaid for the Intereſt of the Kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Peace and War, than we think can be ſaid here, yet thoſe things weight not in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Commerce: The preſent Enquiry is, Whether the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Portugal</hi> Trades are of moſt Advantage to <hi>England?</hi> Many Arguments offer themſelves to our View upon this Head, but I believe no Man will pretend to ſay, but that as Things ſtand now, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade is much more to the general Profit than the <hi>French,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>beſides many other Reaſons,</hi> we make ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Exportation of our Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures for all the Wines, Oyles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we receive from <hi>Portugal;</hi> whereas the Obſtructions in <hi>France</hi> to our Woollen Goods by the War, and the Improvements made in <hi>France,</hi> not only in our Woollen Manufactures, but in many other things, makes that Trade run in a different Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and the Ballance, at leaſt, before our Stop to their Wine, Brandy, and wrought Silks, by the high Duties and Prohibitions now in force were againſt <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument brought againſt theſe things by thoſe who think the Equality of Duties rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; at leaſt, the Argument which is moſt Cogent is this. It may be true, that while our Trade to <hi>France</hi> lies under the Diſcouragements and Diſadvantages of their Tariffs of 1699, and 1701; the Loſs is Ours, becauſe we export but few of our Woollen Manufactures thither. But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0684801900:9"/>
the Queſtion is not yet thought of, How great a Trade we may have to <hi>France,</hi> a Kingdom of ſo large Extent, ſo populous, and ſo wanting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of Wooll, when thoſe high Duties are taken off, and the Tariff of 1664 reſtor'd, as by the Ninth Article is propos'd?</p>
            <p>I ſhall, however, ſtate this as impartially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both as poſſible. We are ſure that now the Trade to <hi>Portugal</hi> is not only a great, but a gainful Trade, and we know it is an encreaſed and an encreaſing Trade, alſo it is a Trade, <hi>as is mention'd above,</hi> eſpecially advantageous to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> in that our whole Import from thence is ballanc'd by our Woollen Manufacture, and great Sums brought hither, in Specie of Gold, every Year. This, as it is ſaid, we are ſure of, and it can be no Offence to any to ſay, we hope that when Commiſſioners ſhall meet as is provided by the Ninth Article to remove the Difficulties, and to regulate mutually the Duties and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Trade, they will be very careful to prevent breaking in too far upon ſo beneficial a Trade as that to <hi>Portugal,</hi> before they have a clear View of making, at leaſt an equal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>Britain</hi> in the Trade to <hi>France;</hi> and this may ſuffice to ſay at preſent upon the Affair of general Equallities in Commerce, which is the Suſtance of the Eighth Article.</p>
            <p>The Ninth Article requires a farther Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and may be particularly divided into three Periods or Heads.<list>
                  <item>1. The propoſal of repealing the Laws on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, which relate to additional Impoſt, and Duties on Merchandizes in both Kingdoms,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0684801900:10"/>
and all the Prohibitions of Importation alſo, from the Year 1664.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſettling the Duties upon <hi>French</hi> Goods imported into <hi>England</hi> upon the ſame Foot, and at the ſame Rates upon which Goods of the like Nature are imported from other Parts.</item>
                  <item>3. The appointing Commiſſioners not only to adjuſt the Exceptions and ſeparate Propoſals which are not yet ſettled, but to regulate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of future Commerce between the Nations, in ſuch a manner as may be for mutual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The two firſt of theſe are contain'd in the firſt Part of the Ninth Article of the Treaty, in theſe Words:<q>It is further agreed, That within the ſpace of two Months after a Law ſhall be made in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whereby it ſhall be ſufficiently provided that no more Cuſtoms or Duties be paid for Goods and Merchandizes brought from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> than what are payable for Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes of the like Nature, Imported into <hi>Great Britain</hi> from any other Country in <hi>Europe;</hi> and that all Laws made in <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſince the Year 1664, for Prohibiting the Importation of any Goods and Merchandizes coming from <hi>France,</hi> which were not prohibited before that time, be repealed, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Tariff made in <hi>France</hi> the 18th Day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> in the Year 1664. ſhall take place there again, and the Duties payable in <hi>France</hi> by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for Goods Imported and Exported, ſhall be paid according to the Tenour of the Tariff abovementioned, and ſhall not exceed the Rule therein ſettled, in the Provinces whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0684801900:11"/>
is there made, and in the other Provinces the Duty ſhall not be payable, otherwiſe than according to the Rule at that time preſcribed; And all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations or Decrees made in <hi>France</hi> ſince the ſaid Tariff of the Year 1664, and contrary thereunto, in reſpect to the Goods and Merchandizes of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſhall be Repealed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To conſider this with all poſſible Impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It muſt be allow'd, that the <hi>French</hi> binding themſelves to Repeal all their Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations or Decrees, made in <hi>France,</hi> back to the Year 1664, entitled them very juſtly to inſiſt upon the ſame Thing with us; and were we ſure that Repealing thoſe Tariffs would open the Door to a Free Trade for our Manufacturers into <hi>France,</hi> that Demand would meet with the leſs Difficulties here, and the Alternative be the more juſt. Of which we ſhall ſay more when we come to enquire into the Excepted Articles.</p>
            <p>But altho' this may ſeem very Juſt for the <hi>French</hi> to demand, yet it will require ſome Retroſpect upon our own Circumſtances, to conſider whether it conſiſts with our Trading Intereſt to come into this Mutual Repealing of Duties and Prohibitions; and indeed whether it be conſiſtent with the very Nature and Being of our Trade: As particularly, the taking off the Prohibition of <hi>Wrought Silks,</hi> which we call <hi>Broad Silks,</hi> and that ſevere Prohibition of <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes</hi> and <hi>Luſtrings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might require here ſome very mature Thoughts to reflect upon the State of our own Trade; <hi>for Example,</hi> The Encouragement given to the Making <hi>Luſtrings</hi> and <hi>Alamodes</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0684801900:12"/>
and upon which the Subſcribers to the <hi>Luſtring-Company</hi> embark'd their Stocks was, without queſtion, the Prohibition of the <hi>French Silks</hi> of that Kind, and the Confidence they had, that if at any time that Prohibition expired, they ſhould obtain that Encouragement which is generally granted to all New Undertakings of that Nature, and without which they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not to be able to promote or ſet up ſuch Works, or at leaſt with any Succeſs; this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is generally the laying large Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or actual Prohibitions, upon Goods of the ſame Nature made in other Countries: But if on the contrary the Impoſitions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions aforeſaid are actually taken off, and the Trade laid open, ſo that the like Goods may be admitted upon low Terms from Abroad, thoſe Undertakings are Ruin'd of meer Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. This I take to be the Caſe of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring-Company</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and I believe the Maſter or Members of that Company will be free to own that they can make but ſmall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the carrying on their ſaid Trade, if the Prohibition and Duty upon the <hi>French Luſtrings</hi> and <hi>Alamodes</hi> ſhould be taken off by this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. What Weight the Intereſt of the Company ſhall bear in the Conſideration of this Great Affair, when either the Parliament in general, or the Commiſſioners when nominated to enquire into it in particular, ſhall come to debate it, I will not undertake to determine.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of our <hi>Broad Weavers</hi> may come next to be mention'd, in Favour of whom, and in Conſideration of the Numbers of Families
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0684801900:13"/>
maintain'd by the Manufacture of <hi>Silk</hi> in this Nation, the General Prohibition of <hi>French Wrought Silks</hi> firſt, and afterwards of <hi>Eaſt-India Wrought Silks</hi> was made. What other Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations moved the Houſe to thoſe Prohibitions, and how importunate the <hi>Weavers</hi> and Importers of <hi>Silk</hi> were to obtain thoſe Prohibitions, is too freſh in the Memories of all Men who think of theſe Things, that I need not repeat any thing of it here: What a Hurt it will be to the <hi>Silk Manufacture</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> I rather leave to the People concern'd to talk of, who are apt to be loud enough, than to pretend to meddle with it here.</p>
            <p>It is argued here, that the Encreaſe of the Exportation of our <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> will follow, by taking off the high Duties in <hi>France,</hi> by which that whole Nation will be open to our Sale, and we ſhall Export vaſt Quantities thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Yearly; I ſay, if this be urged as a thing of ſuch Weight, to which the Loſs in the <hi>Silk Manufactures, &amp;c.</hi> is not to be compared, <hi>I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily yield to it,</hi> only with this Proviſo, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that we are certain that Exportation ſhall ſo increaſe. I ſhall allow my ſelf to hope it will do ſo, at leaſt if the Commiſſioners, who are to meet, can bring the <hi>French</hi> to conſent that the <hi>Engliſh Woollen Manufactures</hi> be compriſed in the Treaty, and the Duties upon them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Tariff of 1664. Nor will I allow that to be a Queſtion in the Caſe, ſince the known Intereſt of their Country ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, and the Ruin or Damage to other parts of our Trade will be ſo juſt an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0684801900:14"/>
But as that Notion of the Increaſe of our <hi>Woollen Manufacture,</hi> is an Anſwer to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general, ſo here may be an Anſwer ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to the <hi>Broad Silk Weavers</hi> and <hi>Luſtring-Company</hi> in particular, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That altho' the Prohibitions be taken off, yet ſtill there ſeems to be a liberty left to <hi>Britain,</hi> by this <hi>Ninth Article,</hi> to continue or lay any higher Duty on ſuch Foreign <hi>Wrought Silks,</hi> as the Government ſhall think needful, to encourage our <hi>Silk Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,</hi> and yet the <hi>French</hi> be obliged to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal their high Duties at the ſame time. This, I ſay, ſeems plain at leaſt to our common view, who can judge of theſe Things but without doors, from theſe two Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>1. From the Demand the <hi>French</hi> make of keeping four Species of Goods up to the Rule of the Tariff of 1699, which if they inſiſt upon, there ſeems to be a Parity of Reaſon that our Commiſſioners may inſiſt upon the like advance of a Duty on the <hi>Wrought Silks</hi> made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> (1.) Becauſe the Reaſon of the <hi>French</hi> for holding up their Duties on our <hi>Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures</hi> to the Tariff of 1699, is the very ſame which we would give for Laying a Duty on their <hi>Silks; (viz.)</hi> the giving the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures at Home the Advantage againſt thoſe which are Imported from Abroad, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the proper Subjects of each Kingdom. (2.) Becauſe it does not contradict the Letter of the Treaty to Lay any new or high Duties or Cuſtoms upon the Goods and Merchandizes of any Kind Imported from <hi>France,</hi> provided it is no more than is paid upon Goods of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0684801900:15"/>
like Nature Imported from other Parts; and I muſt grant, that if this Conſtruction of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle will hold, as I hope and believe it will, the Prohibitions may be all Taken off of the <hi>Broad Silks, Luſtrings, Alamodes,</hi> &amp;c. without ſuch Ruin and Deſtruction to the <hi>Broad Silk Weaving</hi> and <hi>Luſtring Trade</hi> as has been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. But as the Miniſtry on both ſides muſt be allowed the Conſtruction of their own Terms, and to explain their own Thoughts to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo it may not be proper to anticipate all the Thoughts our Commiſſioners may have, leaſt it prepare the Enemy to oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are no more to be look'd upon in Trade as they formerly were, <hi>(viz)</hi> as an Improving and Encroaching People in reſpect to the General Commerce of <hi>Europe,</hi> but as a Nation arriv'd to ſuch an Improvement, that they are really our Rivals in the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of our Trade in particular, I mean the <hi>Woollen Manufacture.</hi> Indeed we have the good Fortune to be on the better ſide of the Hedge with them, and they have the Difficulty of the Want of Materials to ſtruggle with, <hi>(viz.) the WOOLL.</hi> But then againſt that, by their Art, dexterous Management, Money, and other Helps, joined to the Baſeneſs and Treachery of our own People, who for Private Gain will ſet their Hands to the Ruin of their Country, They have found the way, in ſpight of ſevere Laws, ſtrict Guards, and the utmoſt Vigilance of Officers, to get ſo great Quantities of our <hi>Wooll</hi> conveyed over to <hi>France,</hi> as ſufficiently enables them, in Conjunction with <hi>Spaniſh Wooll</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0684801900:16"/>
               <hi>Wooll</hi> from <hi>Barbary,</hi> to make a very great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Woollen Manufactures,</hi> and thereby do us an Ineſtimable Damage in our Trade; and which is yet more, as the People are Poor, Induſtrious, and work very low; where they are able to make the Goods at all, they are ſure to underwork and underſell us.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon it muſt be allow'd, that if the <hi>French</hi> can be brought to open a Door for a free Trade, that is, for an Importation of our <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufactures</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> with moderate Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Value and Gooodneſs of our <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures</hi> would force their own way ſo far, at leaſt, that the Advance they make upon us in thoſe things would not be ſo great, or encreaſe ſo faſt: In order then to come to ſuch a free Trade, many things may be thought on, and it may be counted rational, that <hi>England</hi> ſhould grant all they can be ſuppos'd to grant, and take every Step that can conduce to that main End and Deſign, which they can take and grant without Prejudice to their own Nation, and to the main Trade thereof, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> in ſome other Branch; for to do thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to yeild what would be fatal to it in another Part, would be to build with one Hand, and pull down with another.</p>
            <p>This brings us then to the ſecond Head, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd above.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The ſettling the Duties upon</hi> French <hi>Goods, upon an Equality with the Duties on Goods of the like Nature imported from foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0684801900:17"/>
This, <hi>as is noted above,</hi> ſignifies not at all, <hi>as I can underſtand it,</hi> an entire Reduction of our Impoſt and Cuſtoms upon <hi>French</hi> Goods, or as the Article at firſt View ſeem'd to ſuggeſt, and as many ſtill underſtand it to take off all our new Impoſitions ſince the Year 1664, but rather an Agreement with <hi>France,</hi> that as Peace is reſtor'd between the two Nations, and they ſtand to one another upon an Equality of general Intereſt, in the ſame relation <hi>of Neighbourhood</hi> one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo they ſhould <hi>of Trade</hi> alſo; and the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Duties upon Goods of like Sort, I laid down as the Foundation of this Equality. Thoſe who are of Opinion that an Equality of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Trade is requiſite, muſt produce other Arguments to back that Opinion than I'have ſeen yet, unleſs by Equalities they will make ſuitable Allowances for tie different Scituations of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Quality of Goods, and Circumſtances of Trade.</p>
            <p>Now let others put what Conſtruction they will upon the Ninth Article, and upon the Meaning of thoſe Words, <hi>the ſame Duties,</hi> and <hi>Goods of like nature,</hi> I muſt be allow'd to think that it is implied that Allowances and Regulations muſt be made, in order to bring the Nature of Things <hi>to be like,</hi> and the Duties to <hi>be the ſame;</hi> Things may be ſaid to <hi>be the ſame,</hi> when by juſt Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Proportions they are regulated and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, and brought to an Equality; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, tho' the Sum paid upon any Goods <hi>be the ſame,</hi> yet it may give one Side a great Inequality and Advantage over the other; and that which is the ſame thing in the Letter, is not the ſame in the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0684801900:18"/>
Theſe are things cannot be reaſon'd upon ſo well before hand, as they will be debated and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated upon a Perſonal Treaty with Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and therefore, I ſay, no Judgment can be made at preſent by a common Eye: But that every Body may judge a little what may be the State of our Trade, when this Door of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Commerce is open'd, it may not be improper to look back, and ſee what the Trade was formerly, and to know thereby what we are like to expect, when the high Duties are taken off from the <hi>French</hi> Goods here.</p>
            <p>It is true, that Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> in his Report, from the Books of the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, named in the Act for taking, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, and ſtating the Publick Accounts, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that in the Four Years Interval of Peace, at the latter End of King <hi>William,</hi> we exported to <hi>France</hi> only thus, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> in our <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufactures</hi> only.</p>

To deſcend to farther Particulars: They ſay that in the Year 1685, there was Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Tons of <hi>Wine,</hi> and Six Thouſand Tons of <hi>Brandy,</hi> Imported into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>France;</hi> and more eſpecially, that from . . . . . <hi>Anno</hi> 1688, to . . . . 1689, there was upwards of the ſaid Quantity of Twenty Thouſand Tons of <hi>Wine,</hi> and Six Thouſand Tons of <hi>Brandy,</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>It would be Unjuſt, at this time of day, to let ſuch Accounts as theſe lye open for every one to paſs their Judgments of, without giving the Opinion of him that publiſhes them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Reaſon and Deſign of the making them publick will very much lye in the giving, or not giving, that Opinion; and therefore I think my ſelf bound to own, that I do not look on the ſaid Account to have any Foundation in the Matter of Fact, or in the Nature of the Thing: And therefore as it does not Comport with the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Books of thoſe Years, ſo neither does it to me appear Reaſonable. Howbeit being given in to the late King by ſuch Perſons ſo qualified to know, and who were under ſuch Obligations to do it exactly, I ſhall ſay no more to it but this, That no Man need go any farther for a Reaſon why the late King appear'd very backward, after the Peace of <hi>Reſwick,</hi> to enter upon any Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with <hi>France,</hi> or to open the ſame by Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the ſaid high Duties, which at that time and 'till now have been as a Prohibition on both ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0684801900:21"/>
And I cannot wonder, why any Man who may have drawn his Calculate of Things from theſe Eſtimates, ſhould be of the ſame mind now; for certain it is, that no Export which we can hope for of our Woollen Manufactures to <hi>France,</hi> can ever come up to Balance ſuch an Account as this, nay, tho' the King of <hi>France</hi> were willing to Take off and Revoke all his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs to 1664, and the Tariff of 1664 too.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Books make it appear, as is alſo to be ſeen in the ſaid Report of Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> that the whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> in the Year from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmaſs</hi> 1668, to <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> 1669, came out thus;<table>

            <p>This makes a manifeſt Difference, and ſhews that we ought, upon very good Examination, to take the Calculations of other People in theſe Caſes, who always ſpeak as their Party Opinions guide them: However, take it which way we will, it is apparent, that after this the Quantity of <hi>Wine</hi> in general Imported from all <hi>France,</hi> and from other Countries too, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed prodigiouſly; for whereas during the Years 1668 and 1669, as aboveſaid, when we Imported Six Thouſand Tons of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Brandy</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> there was then no Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at all of <hi>Wine</hi> from <hi>Portugal;</hi> or if there was, the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> knew it by no other Name than of <hi>Spaniſh Wines,</hi> which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be the Caſe; and thoſe <hi>Spaniſh Wines</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the ſame Year to 6343 Tons: So that

            <p>How much of this Wine ſhall in a future Trade be imported from <hi>France,</hi> is hard to determine; ſome alledge the whole Draught of Red Wines will come from thence; but this is running too far and too faſt, for even before the War, tho' the Duties of <hi>French</hi> Wines were much lower than the Duties of the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Wines, yet there were always great Quantities of <hi>Alicant, Florence, Bar a Bar,</hi> and <hi>Oporto</hi> Wines brought in, which, by reaſon of the deepneſs and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the Colour or Face of the Wines, were always found uſeful by the <hi>Vintners</hi> to draw with their thin meaner <hi>French</hi> Wines, and ſold at a much greater Price; and if, as ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, the Vintage in <hi>France</hi> fail'd, or the Wines prov'd ſmall and ill colour'd, the Quantity and Price of the Wines from <hi>Lisbon, Oporto, Alicant, &amp;c.</hi> always encreas'd in Proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0684801900:24"/>
If this was the Caſe then, when the Duties of thoſe other Wines were about 7<hi>l. per</hi> Ton grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Duties of the <hi>French,</hi> we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope it will be ſtill ſo, and with more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines, when the Duties of the <hi>French</hi> Wines ſhall be made Equal.</p>
            <p>But here comes in an Objection, which was hinted at before, upon the Subject of what you will call Equality, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Alicant, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Lisbon</hi> Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> come in here at a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Expence, both in their firſt Coſt, as alſo in their Freight, Cask, length of the Voyage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the <hi>French;</hi> and thus, therefore, if the <hi>French</hi> Wines pay but an equal Duty, yet the Trade is not thereby put upon an Equality, but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage given to the <hi>French,</hi> and that a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be ſtated here, to bring this Matter to an Equality.</p>
            <p>This may have ſome Weight in it, and as I can do no more than mention it here, ſo I cannot prevail upon my ſelf to doubt but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will take Care to have the Diſproportion conſider'd in the further Debates they are to have of that Affair.</p>
            <p>As to the Treaties with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Conditions to be perform'd in that part of the Caſe with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> they are not for a Subject to diſpute, but muſt be left to the Conſideration of Parliament, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and who no doubt will do what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>It remains now to examine a little into that part of the Ninth Article which ſpeaks of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0684801900:25"/>
excepted Species of Goods, and of appointing Commiſſaries to regulate the Duties and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of thoſe Species, according to the Tenor of the other part of the Agreement: This is contained in the following words of the Article it ſelf, (viz.) <q>But whereas it is urged on the Part of <hi>France,</hi> that certain Merchandizes, that is to ſay, Manufactures of Wooll, Sugar, Salted Fiſh, and the Product of Whales be excepted out of the Rule of the above-mentioned Tariff, and likewiſe other Heads of Matters belonging to this Treaty remain, which having been propoſed on the part of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> have not yet been mutually adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Specification of all which is contained in a ſeparate Inſtrument Subſcribed by the Ambaſſadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiaries on both ſides; It is hereby Provided and Agreed, that within two Months from the Exchange of the Ratifications of this Treaty, Commiſſaries on both ſides ſhall meet at <hi>London,</hi> to conſider of, and remove the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties concerning the Merchandizes to be excepted out of the Tariff of the Year 1664, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other Heads, which, as is aboveſaid, are not yet wholly adjuſted. And at the ſame time the ſaid Commiſſaries ſhall likewiſe endeavour, (which ſeems to be very much for the Intereſt of both Nations) to have the Methods of Commerce on one part, and of the other, more thoroughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and to find out and eſtabliſh juſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial means on both ſides for removing the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in this matter, and for regulating the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mutually. But it is always underſtood and provided, that all and ſingular the Articles of this Treaty, do in the mean while remain in their full
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0684801900:26"/>
force, and eſpecially that nothing be deemed, under any Pretence whatſoever, to hinder the benefit of the General Tariff of the Year 1664, from being granted to the Subjects of Her Royal Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects from having and enjoying the ſame, without any Delay or Tergiverſation, within the ſpace of two Months after a Law is made in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, in as ample manner and form as the Subjects of any Nation, the most favoured, might have and enjoy the benefit of the aforeſaid Tariff, any thing to be done, or diſcuſſed by the ſaid Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to the contrary in any wiſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems here that the four Species of Goods mentioned, <hi>(viz.) Fiſh,</hi> produce of <hi>Whale,</hi> that is, <hi>Whale Fins</hi> and <hi>Oyl, Sugar</hi> Refin'd, and <hi>Woollen Maenufactures,</hi> ſhall be excepted out of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; that is to ſay, out of the Tariff of 1664: But what then, ſay we, ſignify all the reſt, for our Woollen Manufacture is the main thing which we have to inſiſt upon, if this ſhould not be adjuſted then the whole Trade is gone? It is to be hoped, that the Wiſdom of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will provide, That unleſs ſuch a Method may be found out that our Manufactures may be admitted into <hi>France</hi> upon ſuch Terms as will make them Vendible there, and that they may not only come to Market, but may have a Market to come to where they will be Sold, they will be very Cautious how they make a Law to Take off our high Duties and Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the <hi>French</hi> Goods; for this would
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0684801900:27"/>
be to Ruin us effectually, by admitting <hi>French</hi> Goods of all kinds into <hi>England,</hi> and having our Woollen Manufactures, in effect, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
            <p>The great Queſtion then is, What is the Tariff of 1699, which the Articles make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and what is the Difference between that and 1664? And to Anſwer this directly it is to be underſtood, that there is no ſuch thing in <hi>France</hi> as a Tariff of 1699, that reſpects <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods, other than that mentioned before made with <hi>Holland,</hi> by which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fine Broad Cloth is Taxed at 20 Livres for 25 Ells <hi>French, (viz.)</hi> for about 30 to 31 Yards more than they were Charged before, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by the Tariff of 1664, and Serges, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in proportion. This Addition is the Thing upon which it ſeems turns the Queſtion between a Trade and no Trade with <hi>France.</hi> If this Addition will effect a Prohibition, the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot inſiſt upon it when he propoſes a Treaty of Trade; for that would be to have us open our Trade to him, and ſhut up his Trade from us: But if the <hi>French</hi> King is in Earneſt to ſeek a Treaty of Commerce with us, then the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tariff of 1664 and 1699 is ſo little, that he cannot ſcruple to give it up: Beſides, as by the Eighth Article, <q>the Subjects of <hi>Britain</hi> are to enjoy all thoſe Privileges, Liberties and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and have the like favour in all things as to all Duties, Impoſitions or Cuſtoms whatſoever, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Perſons, Goods and Merchandizes, which any Foreign Nation, the moſt favour'd, enjoys, or may hereafter have, uſe and enjoy.</q> If this, I ſay,

be agreed, then it will remain to enquire, How the Treaties of Commerce with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other Nations have ſettled this Affair, as to Salted Fiſh and Woollen Manufactures; for as to the Produce of Whales it concerns us little, who have no Whale Fiſhing; and as to Fiſh, the <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo are the main Parties concern'd: But as to the Woollen Manufacture, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> have yielded that Point, then we ſeem to be ſtop'd by the Eighth Article from asking any more; and how far that may conſiſt with the Sale of our Manufactures in <hi>France</hi> remains to be Examined, and we may hope will be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually Debated before it be yielded to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Debate which the reſpective Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be appointed are to have, as the Article ſays <hi>for the Intereſt of both Nations,</hi> will no queſtion be very agreeable to all Honeſt Men, if it may be ſo adjuſted as that our Woollen Manufactures may meet with no Interruption in their Exportation to <hi>France.</hi> No queſtion, there may be ſuch Regulations of Commerce made as may be for the Intereſt of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but all muſt be with a ſuppoſition of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our Manufactures into <hi>France</hi> upon Equal and Reaſonable Terms; which if it be not done, our Trade is rather prohibited than extended, rather ſhut up than opened; ſo that upon this one Article all the reſt depends, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Trade be open'd for our Woollen Goods in <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>How elſe ſhall we make our ſelves amends for the Loſs of our Trade in <hi>Portugal?</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing here to the Obligation upon Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0684801900:29"/>
to the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> the Government will no doubt concern themſelves to preſerve the Conditions of every Agreement with the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> from any Claſhing Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies one with another: No more will I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſay the <hi>Portugueze</hi> wait to prohibit our Manufactures as ſoon as they ſhall hear this Tranſaction is ſettled; I do not believe the <hi>Portugueze</hi> ſo weak neither: We are told, this will be moſt certain, that whatever amends we may make our ſelves by the <hi>French</hi> Trade, we ſhall certainly leſſen our Wine Trade from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and to alſo from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> and other parts, to whom we at the ſame time ſend very large Quantities of our Manufactures; and therefore if the Treaty with <hi>France</hi> do not make up the Diminution of thoſe Trades, it will not then be an Equivalent to us for the Exchange. But we hope the Commiſſioners, who are to meet upon this Subject, will concern themſelves to weigh this part alſo, and ſo to admit the <hi>French</hi> Trade, that the Trade to <hi>Portugal</hi> may not be in a worſe Caſe than it was before the War. Indeed it muſt be Own'd, it would be hard to ſuggeſt that the Trade to <hi>Portugal</hi> can be in a worſe ſtate than it was before the War; when it is known that before the War, the whole Duties upon <hi>French</hi> Wines were not more than 8<hi>l.</hi> or thereabout <hi>per Ton;</hi> and at the ſame time the <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines paid above 16<hi>l.</hi> 8<hi>s.</hi> Duty: And beyond the Years 1664, we do not find any Wines import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Portugal</hi> at all, but under the Title of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wines; which may be noted, not that there came no Wines from <hi>Portugal</hi> at all; but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0684801900:30"/>
that <hi>Portugal</hi> was then under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> 'till the Revolt of the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> the Grandfather of the Preſent King: I ſay then it can hardly be rational to think the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade will be quite ſunk, or that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> will prohibit Trade with us; but that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Wines paying the ſame Dutys, the firſt will gain the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at Market, no body will queſtion; and therefore it had been to be wiſhed, there had been ſome little reſerv'd advantage to the Trade of <hi>Portugal</hi> Wine: But ſince it is otherwiſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Trade muſt take its Fate; and all that remains ſeems to be the taking a due Care, that the Trade to <hi>France</hi> for our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures may be ſo enlarged, as may be a Recompence for what may happen on the other ſide; and if this may but appear, we ſhall have reaſon to be the better ſatisfy'd with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Commerce; and we ſhall all be glad to find it ſo, that the Complaints of thoſe, who pretend to fear, nay to know (as they ſay) the contrary, may appear to have been without ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Silk Manufacture</hi> is next to be conſidered; the <hi>Luſtring Company</hi> is now near expiring, and their Charter, which was granted for <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Years, is almoſt run out; whether they will obtain a New Charter or no is not for us to enquire, whatever we may ſuppoſe; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall or not, it may be the ſame thing; the Prohibition, or Duty equal to a Prohibition, upon <hi>Luſtrings</hi> and <hi>Alamodes,</hi> if it is to remain, as by the Equality with other Nations mentioned
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0684801900:31"/>
in the Treaty, it may, makes a very great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Manufacture at home, and the Importation from abroad; whether the <hi>Luſtring-Company</hi> can go on or no, is for them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: But it muſt be own'd, that if the Dutys on Foreign <hi>Luſtrings</hi> are held up at about 35<hi>l. per Cent.</hi> more than the Manufactures of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings</hi> at home are valued at, and the <hi>Luſtring-Company</hi> cannot go on, but the Foreign will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell them, the making them at home muſt ſink under the Imperfections of the Performance, rather than under the miſtake of the Treaty of Commerce.</p>
            <p>It is true, a Man, who has any Value for the Trade of his Native Country, cannot but regret the misfortune of the Humour of our People in <hi>Britain,</hi> who are ſo far from Encouraging the Manufactures of their own Country, that they will upon all Occaſions, and almoſt in all Caſes, chooſe any thing to wear that comes from abroad, and advance in price for ſuch Goods, without regard to the real Goodneſs or Worth of the thing they buy, meerly upon its being Foreign. This puts all Manufacturing, at leaſt of Silks, under very great Diſcouragements, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has defeated the End and Deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wholeſome and good Laws, which have been made for the Encouragement of our own People; and it is feared, this will ſtill be a help to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt in Trade, when our Duties on their Goods ſhall be reduced to an Equality with the Goods and Merchandiſes of other Countries; It is true, that this is a Miſchief that ought, if it were poſſible, rather to be puniſhed than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0684801900:32"/>
Encouraged; but ſtill while this is our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and we cannot help it, the Government may provide as well againſt it in Treaties and Capitulations, as the Nature of ſuch things will admit.</p>
            <p>How far it can be expected, that the Miniſters of State ſhould in Treaties of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce allow for theſe National Follies, I will not meddle with here; it is moſt certain, that if this Humour of our People prevails after the preſent Treaty, they may defeat the beſt Deſigns of the Government in the Treaty, and make that miſchievous, which otherwiſe would not be ſo: We had an Eminent Example of this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the People, in the Extravagance of their Fancy after the <hi>Painted Callicoes</hi> and <hi>Fine Chints</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which run on to ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an Extreme, that on a ſudden you ſaw all the Ladies of Quality, and wealthy Citizens Wives, dreſs'd up in a Tawdry piece of <hi>Callicoe,</hi> which but a few Years before, their Chamber-Maids would have thought beneath them to be ſeen in: Nor was this all, but immediately by the ſame Rule our Velvet and Damask-beds, fine Window-curtains, nay the very Hangings of Rooms, were all turn'd into <hi>Painted Callicoes</hi> and <hi>Meſlepatan Chints,</hi> to the entire Deſtruction, if it had gone on, of the <hi>Silk Manufacture,</hi> and the exceeding Damage of the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> alſo: There was no Remedy for this Diſtemper, <hi>(for no doubt it was a Diſtemper in our People)</hi> but to quaſh it at once by an immediate Prohibition of all <hi>Eaſt-India Silks</hi> and <hi>Painted Callicoes,</hi> and forbidding the wearing and making them up,

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things are mentioned here for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to note, that ſince our Fancies are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd; if poſſible then, whatever Treaties of Commerce are made, as much Proviſion ought alſo to be made, as the Nature of the Thing will permit, to prevent the ill Conſequences of it in our Trade.</p>
            <p>It is very well known, that the like Exceſs in the Humour and Temper of our People has for many Years paſt appear'd in their Extravagant Paſſion for every thing that is <hi>French,</hi> as well in Wearing Apparel, <hi>Silks,</hi> &amp;c. as in <hi>Wines;</hi> and if the Extravagance ſhould now return to poſſeſs our Fancy, when the <hi>French</hi> Trade opens by this New Treaty, we may ruin our own Trade in ſpight of the beſt Conditions and Articles in the World. As an Exhortation againſt this Humour in the People would be of greater Uſe in the main, than all poſſible Exclamation can be againſt the Treaty, ſo it cannot be offenſive to any one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0684801900:34"/>
to ſay, that this will neceſſarily move the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when they ſhall treat by the New Commiſſioners, which the Treaty allows, that ſuch Dutys may be kept up upon Foreign <hi>Wrought Silks,</hi> or added if need be, as will give our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Silk</hi> a ſufficient preference, and cauſe thoſe People, who will ſtill be for <hi>French</hi> Goods, to ſee the Madneſs and Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Fancy, and how dear they muſt pay or worſe Goods than they may have at home.</p>
            <p>It cannot be doubted, but ſuch Meaſures would in Time give a ſhock to the Miſchief, and perhaps in Time take off our People from the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and Folly, which has formerly done them ſo much Harm in Trade, and is ſtill ſo dangerous in the Caſe before us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are an Induſtrious People; they work cheap, and work well; their Fancy in contriving Faſhions, Figures and Fancies in their Work, is very bright and quick, and theſe Things recommend their Goods to us; the Vanity and Levity of their Nation prompts them to apply to all the Novelties and Niceties of Dreſs; they gratify the Beaus and the Ladies, and this leads us inſenſibly into the Error, and makes our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple infinitely fond of their Trade. If then the Commiſſaries, who are to meet and regulate the Trade, do not ſtate the Duties on <hi>Wrought Silks,</hi> &amp;c. ſo as to give a very great Difference to the <hi>Engliſh Wrought Silk,</hi> ſo as that they may not be diſcouraged in their Work, and the Humour for every thing that is <hi>French</hi> again prevail, our Home-Trade will be ruin'd of Courſe, and by its own Friends, even the very People who ought to ſupport and carry it on.</p>

            <p>Theſe Dutys the <hi>French</hi> may ſtill be obliged to pay, becauſe all other Nations pay the ſame: Nay, if our Articles are rightly managed, and the Parliament thinks fit to lay any other and higher Dutys on the ſaid Species of <hi>Wrought Silks,</hi> ſo be it, that other Nations pay the ſame Dutys upon Goods of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>It is humbly recommended then to thoſe, in whoſe Hands Power is or ſhall be lodg'd to do theſe Things, that they would conſider the many Thouſand Families of our Poor, as well <hi>Weavers</hi> as others, who depend upon the <hi>Silk Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in this Nation; as alſo the Great and truly Beneficial Trade to <hi>Turkey</hi> and the <hi>Levant,</hi> from whence our <hi>Silk</hi> is chiefly Imported, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe which, our <hi>Broad Cloth</hi> is ſent in ſuch great Quantities, as to make a very conſiderable Figure alſo in the Employment of our People in the Country; all which muſt ſink in a very great Degree, if ſome immediate Care is not taken, and Means uſed to keep up the Value of our own <hi>Broad Silks,</hi> and keep down and diſcourage, as much as may be, the Importation of <hi>French Silks,</hi> upon this New Opening of the Trade.</p>
            <p>This is the rather urged now, becauſe it is evident that there is room very happily made in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0684801900:36"/>
the Treaty for it, and that at the ſame time that we apprehend the Danger, we yet can with Satisfaction ſo far Compliment the Makers of this Treaty, in that they have left room for ſo advantageous a Step to be taken in favour of the <hi>Weavers,</hi> and <hi>Workers</hi> of <hi>Silk;</hi> and that by the Treaty it may be done, ſince, as above, the <hi>French</hi> ſcruple not our high Duties at all, only deſire that they may pay no more than other Nations, which if it be Granted them can do us no Harm, provided that both they and all other Nations may but be obliged to pay ſo much, that we may be able to go on with our Trade at Home.</p>
            <p>This is not ſaid by way of Complaint againſt any thing agreed on in the Treaty: The Danger does not ſeem to be in what is done, and Agreed on by the Treaty, but from what may yet be done in Conſequence of the Treaty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that this Caſe is inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen very large Accounts Publiſhed of the Importations of <hi>Foreign Silks</hi> from <hi>France:</hi> Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Report to the Commiſſioners of Accounts ſays, that the Commiſſioners of Trade in King <hi>William</hi>'s Time gave his Majeſty an Account, that the Importations from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England</hi> only, amounted in Value in this one Article of <hi>Wrought Silks</hi> to <hi>l.</hi>300,000 <hi>Sterling.</hi>

It is noted in the ſame Scheme, that there was recieved at the Port of <hi>Dover</hi> that Year <hi>l.</hi>15000 for the Dutys on <hi>French Wrought Silks,</hi> beſides what may be ſuppoſed to be run there that Year.</p>
            <p>It is not material for us to examine into the Truth of theſe Accounts: Nay, tho' they ſhould be allowed to be Fictitious and Falſe, as I believe they are.—But it will be allowed that the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity was very great; and it is Humbly Offered to the Conſideration of thoſe whom it concerns to weigh from hence, How great a Conſumption of the <hi>Silk Manufacture</hi> this Nation makes, and conſequently how well worthy their Concern it is, that as much of this as is poſſible, might be manufactur'd by our own Hands, and the Trade be kept among our ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is true, as the Dutys are now, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 12<hi>l.</hi> for every 20<hi>l.</hi> or 12<hi>s. per</hi> Pound Duty on the ſaid <hi>Wrought Silks,</hi> it is a very great Difference; but as this comes to be reckoned upon the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it does not, eſpecially in midling ſlight <hi>Silks,</hi> amount to much by the Yard; and ſuppoſe it was one Shilling, or Two Shillings <hi>per</hi> Yard, it is too well known that the Humour of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when they are buying Fine Cloths, and are wheedled with the Opinion of the Fineneſs and Goodneſs of <hi>French Silks,</hi> is not to be reſtrain'd by a Shilling, Two or Three in a Yard.</p>
            <p>If then the Duties were enlarged upon the ſine Wrought <hi>Silks</hi> to ſuch a Degree, that the Weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Broad Silks</hi> and Rich <hi>Brocaded Silks</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> may not be diſcouraged, ſuch a Treaty of Commerce will be a happy means to prevent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0684801900:38"/>
the Ruin of our Trade, the ſtarving many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Poor Familys, and the <hi>French</hi> Trade may not be ſo prejudicial to us in that particular Trade, as otherwiſe there is reaſon to fear. It might be offered at to ſet down what Addition of Duty would be ſufficient to preſerve our Trade in this Caſe; but I rather chooſe to omit that, than preſcribe to our Legiſlature: The <hi>Weavers</hi> are of Age; ask them, they are the beſt Judges.</p>
            <p>The like Argument, and with the ſame Force, will hold good in the <hi>Linnen Manufacture,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince two great Events, both which have happened ſince the Commencement of the late War.<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe Countrys are now employed, at leaſt very conſiderably, in <hi>Linnen Manufactures,</hi> and it is not to be doubted, but that we are and ought to be very juſtly concern'd for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of them both. Now if the aforeſaid Printed Accounts of Importations from <hi>France</hi> are true for the Year 1674, which however I muſt own I do not Credit, yet thus far they ſerve to argue in this Caſe, that the <hi>Linnen Manufacture</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is very conſiderable.</p>
