            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Egad, I am afraid, to very little. You ſhall judge. As I was quite a ſtranger in the place, I naturally inquired, you know, for the mayor of the corporation; who received me kindly enough for a ſtranger, and civilly offered to call a meeting of the principal town's-people the next day. Accordingly I got a ſpeech ready for them at my inn, over night, and met his worſhip, with Mr. recorder, and the reſt, in the town-hall, in the morning.</p>

We have ſeen ſome of our greateſt ſpeakers talk themſelves out of breath, till they talked themſelves out of credit. For, after all, words are but wind, you know, Mr. Alderman.—Had you no bank-pape rabout you? a written plea has ſometimes a better effect than one delivered viva voce; not all the rhetorical flouriſhes of Cicero and Demoſthenes put together, have half the pathos of the plain hand-writing of three or four petty clerks in Thread-needle-ſtreet;—bank-notes, bank-notes, Mr. Lombard, are now a-days, the only prevailing arguments.</p>

He has a fine fortune of his own, and is ſatisfied with yours, though not a penny be added to your grandfather's legacy. And then your papa, who loves you ſo tenderly as to ſee you once a year, and write to you by ſome of his clerks once a quarter, will hardly plead paternal fondneſs, to keep you longer on his hands.</p>

What, in the name of wonder, can be the matter with him now? Had you a quarrel with him laſt night?

                     <p>Well then, colonel, as you are now come to yourſelf again, tell me plainly what's the matter. You have been already with my father, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</p>

                     <p>I have, Sophia; and this piece of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is attended with that of another unlucky cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: Mr. Lombard is come down to canvaſs in the borough for which I have declared myſelf a candidate.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Call you that an unlucky circumſtance? If you have a mind to take any advantage of it, it may, on the contrary, prove a lucky one; for if I know any thing of my father, he will certainly give up to you all his authority over his daughter Sophy, if you will give up to him all your intereſt in the borough of Gluttonbury.—And, indeed, now I think on't, you are rather too young, colonel, for a ſenator.— Beſides, I ſhould not chuſe to have a huſband taken up with the buſineſs of the nation, when he ſhould be employed in mine.</p>

                     <p>I am fearful, my dear, leſt it ſhould offend nobody ſo much as yourſelf. When I was of your age, I was juſt ſuch another wild unthinking thing as you are. Careleſs of cenſure, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous that while I preſerved my innocence, I might laugh at decorum, as mere formality; but the world is come to ſuch a paſs, Narciſſa, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue itſelf is often of leſs conſequence to the peace and happineſs of our lives than the appearance of it. It is not enough to be innocent, unleſs we ſeem ſo.</p>

                     <p>And in what do I appear ſo heinouſly guilty, madam? In laughing at the rueful dejection of the poor colonel, or in giving encouragement to the addreſſes of Mr. Melmoth, to whom you have never before made any objection.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Mild.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, my dear, I have hitherto made none, becauſe I wou'd not aſſume too great an influence over you, in making a choice of ſo much

importance to the future happineſs of your life. But I ſhou'd but ill diſcharge the duty of a mother, Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa, if I did not confeſs, and that without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular objection to Mr. Melmoth, that I think you would be much happier with my lord Courtly, who hath made the faireſt offers, and of whoſe regard for you, I am now more than ever convinced.</p>

                     <p>Well, my dear, I only ſpeak my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. I have no objection to your engaging the affections or encouraging the addreſſes of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving lover; but I muſt inſiſt on your indulging yourſelf leſs in raillery, at the expence of your friends.</p>

                     <p>But I ſhou'd think, Madam, one's friends would be the leaſt apt to take offence, and that the behaviour you complain of might be a good method to put their friendſhip to the proof.</p>

                     <p>Then you think wrong, Narciſſa. I know, by woful experience, the danger of trifling with a heart that loves one. It was this fatal indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in me that gave riſe to a groundleſs jealouſy in the breaſt of the fondeſt of huſbands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived you of the tender affections of a father.</p>

True, Narciſſa; but your rigid uncle, to whoſe kindneſs we are nevertheleſs indebted for our whole fortune, ſo highly reſented your father's injurious uſage of me, that he inſiſted on my renouncing the name, and, if poſſible, even the memory, of a man who had ſo cruelly wronged me.</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. Mild.</speaker>
                     <p>No, my dear Narciſſa. It is the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the ſhare I had in contributing to that fatal ſeparation that diſtreſſes me.

It is not a month ſince you drew for the laſt five hundred, and now you are preſſed for another.

                     <p>Then I am not the firſt meſſenger of ill-news—you have heard of your father's death, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But come, though it be an afflicting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you parted from him too early in life to feel much for his perſonal loſs.</p>

                     <speaker>Y. Melm.</speaker>
                     <p>I own it; and had his fortune died with him, I ſhou'd have ſupported the loſs of that too, with equanimity: but to receive ſuch a cruel inſtance of his want of paternal regard, as that of bequeathing the whole of it away from me.</p>

                     <p>I heard nothing of this. — By a letter I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from general Melmoth, a relation of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, juſt now arrived from India, I learn that Sir John is dead; but nothing more.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I have learned much more. It ſeems, the late Sir John Melmoth, no long before his death, was married to a ſecond wife, to whom he left his whole fortune.</p>

                     <p>Nay, but compoſe yourſelf. Things may not be ſo bad as you apprehend.—I expect the general himſelf hourly in Bath; who, I dare ſay, when he comes to know your real character, will, if things are thus circumſtanced, be your friend. At worſt, if you have a mind for the army, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, on my own intereſt, to ſet you preſently at the head of a company. Then, Narciſſa will have a handſome fortune; and I cannot ſuppoſe, after mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been carried ſo far between you, that this accident will prove any obſtacle to your marriage.</p>

                     <p>It is there, there, my dear colonel, I feel this reverſe of fortune the moſt ſeverely. For, though Narciſſa ſhould be too generous to reject me merely from mercenary motives, ought I to have leſs generoſity than ſhe? ought I to take the advantage of her partiality for me, to make a prey of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and permit her to throw herſelf away on a young fellow without a penny in his pocket, or a profeſſion by which he might have the proſpect of getting one? No, colonel, till I am maſter of a competency, at leaſt equal to hers, I will relinquiſh my pretenſions.—But when that may be, or what may happen in the interval! O colonel—</p>

                     <p>What a cruel diſappointment is this! When Narciſſa had juſt conſented to reward my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and I expected my father in England to ratify our fond engagements.</p>

I cannot help thinking you are under ſome miſtake: but be it as it will, I will venture to anſwer for it Narciſſa is ſtill yours. Keep only this piece of information a ſecret from her, 'till it be farther confirmed. When I ſee you again, we may be able to judge of it, and proceed with more certainty.</p>

                     <p>I am glad, my dear colonel, to find you thus happily ſituated; and alſo to hear that Mr. Melmoth has merit enough to engage you ſo warmly in his favour. A young fellow capable of making ſuch valuable friendſhips, can never be ſo bad as he has been repreſented. I own we had but very ſorry accounts of my wild kinſman tranſmitted us to India.</p>

                     <p>My friend Frederic, Sir, is young and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; but having ſenſe and principle, is in the way of reformation: for he has not only good qualites enough to make himſelf friends among the men, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the eſteem of a young lady of the firſt diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for perſonal merit.</p>

                     <p>I am pleaſed to hear it. An amiable and virtuous monitor of the other ſex is certainly the beſt reformer of ours.</p>

Being no ſtranger how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to her art and avarice, I prevailed on him to make a ſubſequent teſtament juſt before his death; by which the lady is more moderately provided for, and the bulk of his fortune more equitably left to his ſon. I am myſelf executor to this laſt will, and ſhall take a proper opportunity to undeceive the young man, as well as his father's agent; on whom I find

                     <p>With your leave, colonel, I had rather that were deferred. I could not hope indeed to find a youth of his education and fortune as grave and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential as a rigid moraliſt; yet, having received ſuch an indifferent impreſſion of his character, I could wiſh to put his diſpoſition a little to the proof.

It may be the means alſo of trying the diſpoſition of his miſtreſs; whom I ſhould wiſh to have a diſintereſted regard for him. —If ſhe loves him in ſpite of his ſuppoſed poverty, her conſtancy may be rewarded with a better fortune.</p>

                     <p>Nay then there is the leſs harm, my dear, in going to be married without it. If ſhe has no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, you know, but what might be removed by ſolicitation, the ſolicitation would be merely a matter of form, a piece of childiſh ceremony.—Beſides, my dear Sophy, to anſwer all your petty ſcruples about diſobedience at once, I am determined on the thing preciſely, becauſe I would not be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>

                     <p>Very plainly.—My mama has not yet poſitively told me ſhe would not have me marry Mr. Melmoth:—on the contrary, ſhe has hitherto encouraged his addreſſes: but as I ſhrewdly ſuſpect ſhe might tell me ſo in plain terms the next time we converſe on the ſubject, I don't intend to give her an opportunity of laying me under any ſuch injunction. —Becauſe, in that caſe, you know, it would be

                     <p>Well, but you may be his ſecond, colonel, and prolong the ceremonials 'till I have had ſome talk with the young lady's mother.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0310900700:80"/>
I can do no leſs than try how far my influence may extend now. If Mrs. Mildmay's objections to young Melmoth be merely founded on his ſuppoſed want of fortune, they are readily obviated; and if lord Courtly be as you ſay, a man of ſenſe and principle, he will give up the point; and no longer endeavour to divide two young people, whoſe hearts ſeem form'd for each other. O! here comes Mr. Alderman Lombard.</p>

                     <p>From colonel Camply's own mouth, madam; who call'd me into the parlour this morning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to catechiſe me like a ſchool-maſter. Mrs. Sift, ſays he, what makes you abroad ſo early? What, your ladies have ſent you out upon the enquiry, I ſuppoſe, I know they are curious and inquiſitive.—Indeed, Sir, ſays I, you know no lady in our houſe half ſo inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as myſelf. Well, ſays he, what's the news then, at home? Why, Sir, ſays I, we hear that Mr. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth's father is dead, and has diſinherited him.— Diſinherited him! ſays he, an idle ſtory, Sift, an idle ſtory, there is nothing in it.—So I thought, an pleaſe your honour, ſaid I, for I underſtood Mr. Melmoth was ſon to the ſtrange gentleman who viſited you yeſterday. Ay, Sift, ſays he, while that gentleman lives, Mr. Melmoth's fortunes are in the hands of a father.—Oh, ma'am, I'm poſitively certain it is as I firſt ſuggeſted.—</p>

                     <p>Yes, Narciſſa, that long-loſt father, whom you have heard me ſo often lament, is now in Bath.

                     <p>Ay, ay, my daughter and the borough go together. There, take her, colonel; and make her juſt as good a huſband as ſhe proves a wife—for my own part, I ſhall defer my matrimonial project to another opportunity: and, I think, it would not be amiſs if his lordſhip follows my example.</p>

                     <p>Such a diſpoſition, my lord, cannot go long unrewarded. Your lordſhip will do me honour in permitting me to cultivate a farther acquaintance with it. But, from the events of to-day, we may ſee how ineffectual are all attempts to ſeparate thoſe whom love hath united, and heaven preſerv'd for each other.</p>
