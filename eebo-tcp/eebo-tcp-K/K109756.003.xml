            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>SOME authors have confounded this bird with the Alpine Crow; but the diſtinction is clearly marked. Its bill is longer, more ſlender, more hooked, and of a red colour; its tail is alſo ſhorter, its wings longer, and, as a natural conſequence, its flight is more lofty; and laſtly, its eyes are environed by a ſmall red circle.</p>
               <p>It is true that the Red-legged Crow reſembles the Alpine Crow in the colour and in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1084500103:15"/>
inſtincts. In both, the plumage is black with green reflections of blue and purple, which have an admirable effect on that dark ground. Both delight in the ſummits of the loftieſt mountains, and ſeldom deſcend into the plain. The former, however, is much more diffuſed than the latter.</p>
               <p>The Red-legged Crow is of an elegant figure, lively, reſtleſs, turbulent, but can be tamed to a certain degree. At firſt it is fed with a ſort of paſte made with milk, bread, and grain, &amp;c. and afterwards it is reconciled to whatever is ſerved for our tables.</p>
               <p>Aldrovandus ſaw in Bologna in Italy, a bird of this ſort, which had an odd trick of breaking panes of glaſs from the outſide, as if to enter the houſe by the window: this inſtinct is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the ſame with that of the crows, the magpies, and daws, which are attracted by every thing that glitters. It has even been known to ſnatch from the chimney light pieces of wood, and thus ſet the houſe on fire; ſo that this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous bird adds the character of an incendiary to that of a domeſtic plunderer. But I ſhould imagine that this pernicious habit might be turned againſt itſelf, and, like the lark, it might be decoyed into ſnares, by means of mirrors.</p>
               <p>Salerne ſaw at Paris two Red-legged Crows which lived peaceably with the houſe pigeons; but it is probable that he had not ſeen the Wild Crow of Geſner, nor the deſcription which that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1084500103:16"/>
author gives of it; ſince he ſays after Ray, that it agreed in every thing but in ſize with the <hi>coracias</hi>; whether he meant the bird to which this article is allotted, or the <hi>pyrrhocorax</hi> of Pliny. Theſe birds are widely different, and Geſner was careful not to confound them. He knew that the Wild Crow differs from the Red-legged Crow by its creſt, its carriage, the ſhape and length of its bill, the ſhortneſs of its tail, the excellence of its fleſh, at leaſt when young; that it was not ſo noiſy or ſo ſedentary, and that it changed its reſidence more regularly at certain times of the year<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>; not to mention other differences.</p>
               <p>The Red-legged Crow has ſhrill though a pretty loud cry, very like that of the Sea-pie. It chatters almoſt inceſſantly; and Olina remarks that it is bred not for its voice, but for its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful plumage<note n="†" place="bottom">

precipices; for, according to Edwards, theſe birds prefer the cliffs all along the weſt coaſt of England, to ſimilar ſituations on the flat ſhores of the eaſt and ſouth. I ſhall add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fact of the ſame kind, which I owe to a very reſpectable obſerver<note n="*" place="bottom">Hebert, treaſurer extraordinary of war at Dijon.</note>. It is, that though theſe birds be inhabitants of the Alps, of the mountains of Switzerland, and of thoſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne, &amp;c. they are never found on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Bugey, nor in all the chain that ſtretches along the confines of the country of Gex as far as Geneva. Belon, who ſaw them on Mount Jura in Switzerland, again obſerved them in the iſlands of Crete, and always on the ſummits of rocks. But Haſſelquiſt affirms that theſe birds arrive in Egypt, and ſpread through the country after the inundation of the Nile has ſubſided and the waters are about to return into their bed. If we admit this fact, which however ſeems to be repugnant to the general nature of theſe birds, we muſt ſuppoſe that they are drawn to Egypt by the abundance of food with which the lands are replete, after being left by the waters to the powerful influence of a tropical ſun: and in fact, they feed on inſects, and on ſeeds which have been lately committed to the ſoil, and ſwell with milky juice, the effect of incipient vegetation. It follows then, that theſe birds do not confine their reſidence excluſively to rocks and the ſummits of mountains, ſince at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1084500103:18"/>
certain ſeaſons they regularly appear in Lower Egypt. Nor do they ſeem to be equally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to every bleak eminence; but to be directed in their choice by certain peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which have hitherto eſcaped ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers.</p>
               <p>It is probable that the <hi>coracias</hi> of Ariſtotle<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>

                     <bibl>Lib. x. 48.</bibl>
                  </note>, which ſeems to differ in ſize and in the colour of its bill, which is yellow. But the bird of which we here treat, has a red bill and red feet; and as it was ſeen by Belon on the Cretan mountains, it was more likely known to Ariſtotle, than the <hi>pyrrhocorax,</hi> which was ſuppoſed by the ancients to be confined to the Alps, and in fact was not ſeen by Belon in Greece.</p>
               <p>I muſt admit, however, that Ariſtotle makes his <hi>coracias</hi> a ſpecies of daw (<gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>), as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>pyrrhocorax</hi> of Pliny; which would ſeem to favour the identity, or at leaſt the prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imity of theſe two ſpecies. But as in the ſame chapter I find a palmipede bird joined with the daws as of the ſame genus, the philoſopher evidently confounds birds that are of a very different nature; or rather, ſince the text traces a regular analogy, the confuſion muſt have ariſen from ſome miſtakes of the copyiſts. Beſides, the word <hi>pyrrhocorax,</hi> though entirely of Greek

                  </note>, occurs not in any part of Ariſtotle's treatiſe; and Pliny, who was well acquainted with that work, could diſcover in it no account of the bird on which he beſtows that name; and in his deſcription of the <hi>pyrrhocorax,</hi> he does not copy what the Greek philoſopher had ſaid on the ſubject of the <hi>coracias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpecimen examined by the authors of the Britiſh Zoology weighed thirteen ounces, and its wings extended about two feet and a half: the tongue was almoſt as long as the bill, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hooked; the nails black, ſtrong, and hooked.</p>

               <p>THIS bird is of the ſize of a hen; its plumage is black, with fine green reflections, which are variegated nearly as in the Red-legged Crow: like it, the bill and feet are red; but the bill is ſtill longer and more ſlender, very proper for inſerting into the fiſſures of rocks and the cracks in the ground, into the holes of trees and walls, in ſearch of inſects and worms, which are its principal food. In its ſtomach are found portions of the mole-crickets. It eats alſo the <hi>larvoe</hi> of the May-bug, and is uſeful on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the havock which it makes among theſe deſtructive inſects.</p>
               <p>The feathers on the top of its head are longer than the reſt, and form a kind of creſt, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1084500103:21"/>
hangs backwards; but this only appears after they are full grown, and again diſappears when they are aged. Hence the reaſon that in ſome places they are called <hi>Bald Crows,</hi> and in ſome deſcriptions they are repreſented as having a yellow head marked with red ſpots. Theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are probably the tints of the ſkin, which age leaves bare.</p>
               <p>The creſt, which has given occaſion to the name of <hi>Mountain-creſted</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Klein.</note>, is not the only diſtinction between this bird and the Red-legged Crow; its neck is longer and more ſlender, its head ſmaller, its tail ſhorter, &amp;c. Beſides, it is known only as a bird of paſſage, while the Red-legged Crow, as we have already ſeen, is migratory, but only in certain countries and in particular circumſtances. Geſner has therefore divided them properly into two ſpecies; and I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed them by different names.</p>
               <p>The Hermit Crows fly very lofty, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally go in flocks<note n="†" place="bottom">I am aware that Klein makes the Hermit Crow a ſolitary bird; but this is directly contrary to what Geſner aſſerts, the only ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal obſerver, whom Klein copies, without being conſcious, when he tranſcribes from Albin.</note>. They ſeek their food often in the meadows and marſhy places, and always neſtle on the tops of old deſerted towers, or in the clefts of frightful inacceſſible rocks. Senſible, as it were, that their young are delicate meat,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1084500103:22"/>
and much valued by the luxurious, they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to breed them out of the reach of man. But there are ſtill ſome men hardy enough to riſk their lives for the moſt ſordid gain, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves to be let down by ropes from giddy heights, to plunder the infant brood in their receſſes, and reap the moſt dangerous of harveſts.</p>
               <p>The females lay generally two or three eggs every hatch; and thoſe who wiſh to get the brood, commonly leave a young bird in each neſt, in order to invite them to return the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year. When the young are plundered, the parents cry, <hi>ka, ka, kae, kae,</hi> but are ſeldom heard at any other time. The young are eaſily tamed, and the more ſo if they be taken early and before they can fly.</p>
               <p>They arrive in the country of Zurich towards the beginning of April, at the ſame time with the ſtorks. Their neſts are ſought for about Whitſunday, and they depart, the earlieſt of all the birds, in the middle of June. I know not why Barrere has made the Hermit Crow a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of curlew.</p>
               <p>The Hermit Crow inhabits the Alps, the lofty mountains of Italy, Stiria, Switzerland, Bavaria, and the high cliffs which border on the Danube, in the vicinity of Paſſau and Kelkeym. Theſe birds chooſe for their retreat certain natural breaſt-works, or cells of a good aſpect, among
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1084500103:23"/>
the rocks, and hence the name <hi>Klauſs-rappen,</hi> or <hi>Monk-Raven.</hi>

               <p>THIS bird has always been famous; but its bad reputation has been owing, moſt probably, to its being confounded with other birds, and loaded with their ill qualities. It has ever been regarded as the loweſt of the rapacious tribe; the moſt cowardly and the moſt diſguſting. Filth and rotten carcaſes, it is ſaid, are its chief food; and when it gluts its appetite on live prey, its victims are the weak or uſeful animals, lambs, leverets<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus relates a ſtory of two Ravens concerting an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon a hare; they picked out its eyes, and devoured it.</note>, &amp;c. yet it ſometimes attacks the large

It may happen that theſe birds will ſometimes alight upon the backs of the buffaloes, as the hooded crow alights upon the backs of aſſes and ſheep, or the magpie upon the backs of hogs, to eat the inſects which lodge in the hair of theſe animals. It may happen, too, that the Ravens, by exceſſive ſtrokes with their bill, may tear the buffaloes' hides, or even, attracted by the gliſtening of the pupil, they may pick out the eyes; but I cannot perſuade myſelf that they deliberately determine to eat the buffaloes alive, and are able to accompliſh that undertaking.</note>, and then, fixing on the back, it tears off the fleſh deliberately: and what renders the ferocity more deteſtable, it is not incited by the cravings of hunger, but by the appetite for carnage; for it can ſubſiſt on fruits, ſeeds of all kinds, and indeed may be conſidered as on omnivorous animal<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>If to the features which we have now traced of the Raven, we join its gloomy plumage; its cry, ſtill more gloomy, though very feeble; its ignoble port, in proportion to its bulk; its ſavage look; its body ſmelling perpetually of infection<note n="‡" place="bottom">The authors of the Britiſh Zoology alone aſſert, that the Raven has an agreeable ſmell, which is difficult to believe of a bird that feeds on carrion.

This I have been aſſured by Hebert, a very reſpectable obſerver; and the fact is confirmed by the teſtimony of Hernandez, p. 331.

In thoſe times, when augury formed a part of religion, the Ravens, though bad prophets, could not fail to be birds of vaſt importance. The fondneſs of prying into futurity, how diſmal ſoever may be the proſpect, is an ancient malady of the human race. All the various motions of the Raven were ſtudied with the moſt ſcrupulous attention, all the circumſtances of its flight, all the differences of its voice, of which, not to mention the minute diſcriminations too difficult to be appretiated<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>, no leſs than ſixty-four diſtinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions were reckoned up.

Another difference is, that the Ravens are more ſocial than the other rapacious birds: but it is eaſy to account for this; ſince, as they eat every ſort of food, and have more reſources than the reſt of the carnivorous kind, they can ſubſiſt in greater numbers on the ſame extent, and have not therefore the ſame cauſes of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

If this fact were true, it would ſhew that they are really birds of prey; but it does not agree with the obſervations which Hebert has made on the Ravens which inhabit the mountains of Bugey; for they protract the education of their brood beyond the period when theſe are able to provide for themſelves. As it ſeldom happens that opportunity and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents concur in making ſuch obſervations, I ſhall relate them in his own words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">The young Ravens are hatched very early in the ſeaſon, and againſt the month of May are able to quit their neſt. A family of them was every year bred oppoſite to my windows upon the rocks which terminate the proſpect. The young, to the number of four or five, ſat on the large detached fragments about the middle of the precipice, where they were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeen, and drew notice by their continual wailing. Every time that the parents brought them food, which happened fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently during the courſe of the day, they called with a cry, <hi>crau, crau, crau,</hi> very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their other noiſe. Sometimes one tried to fly, and, after a ſlight eſſay, it returned to ſettle upon the rock. Almoſt always ſome one was left behind, and its wailing then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inceſſant. After the young had ſtrength ſufficient to fly, that is, fifteen days at leaſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1084500103:39"/>
after their leaving the neſt, the parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them every morning to the field, and in the evening led them back. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly five or ſix in the afternoon when the family returned, and they ſpent the reſt of the day in noiſy brawling. This practice laſted the whole ſummer, which would give reaſon to ſuppoſe that the Ravens have not two hatches annually.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Geſner fed young Ravens with raw fleſh, ſmall fiſhes, and bread ſoaked in water. They are very fond of cherries, and ſwallow them greedily, with the ſtones and ſtalks; they digeſt, however, only the pulpy part, and in two hours afterwards vomit up the reſt. It is alſo ſaid that they diſgorge the bones of thoſe animals which they eat entire, like the keſtril, the nocturnal birds of prey, the fiſhing birds, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note> Pliny ſays<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>No perſon, as far as I know, has determined the age at which the young Ravens have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their full growth, and are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate. If in the birds, as in the quadrupeds, each period of life was proportional to the total
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1084500103:40"/>
ſpace of exiſtence, we might ſuppoſe that the Crows required many years to reach their adult ſtate; for though the venerable age aſcribed by Heſiod<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">Heſiod aſſigns nine of our ages to the Crow, the quadruple to the ſtags, and this tripled to the Ravens.</q> 
                     <bibl>PLINY, lib. vii. 48.</bibl> If we eſtimate a generation at thirty years, the age of the Crow would be 270 years; that of the ſtag, 1080 years; and that of the Raven, 3240 years. The only way to give a reaſonable ſenſe to the paſſage, is to underſtand the <hi>aetas</hi> of Pliny, and the <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of Heſiod, to mean a year: and, on this ſuppoſition, the life of the Crow would be reckoned at nine years; that of the ſtag, thirty-ſix; and that of the Raven, 108, as proved by obſervation."</note> muſt be conſiderably curtailed, it ſeems well aſcertained that this bird ſometimes lives a century or more. In many cities of France they have been known to attain to that diſtant period; and in all countries and all ages, they have been reckoned as birds extremely long-lived. But the progreſs to maturity muſt be ſlow in this ſpecies compared to the duration of their life; for towards the end of the firſt ſummer, when all the family conſort together, it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the old from the young, and very probably they are capable of breeding the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year.</p>
               <p>We have already remarked that the Crow is not black at firſt. In the decline of life alſo, its plumage loſes the deep colour; and in extreme age, changes into yellow<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>When the Ravens alight upon the ground, they walk, but do not hop.

The tail contains twelve quills, which are about eight inches long, but ſomewhat unequal, the two middle ones being the longeſt, then thoſe next, ſo that the end of the tail appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rounded on its horizontal plane<note n="†" place="bottom">Add to this, that the Ravens have on almoſt their whole body a double ſort of feathers, ſo cloſely adhering to the ſkin, that they cannot be plucked without the help of hot water.</note>.

quills, at an equal diſtance on either ſide, which are commonly alike, are in this ſubject marked with black and white, differently diſtributed.

                  </head>
                  <p>THIS bird is found in the Molucca iſlands, and chiefly at Banda. Our knowledge of it is drawn from an imperfect deſcription and a wretched figure; ſo that we can only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture the European ſpecies to which it belongs. Bontius, the firſt and I believe the only one who has ſeen it, reckons it a Raven, in which he is followed by Ray, Willoughby, and ſome others; but Briſſon conceives it to be a Calao. I would rather adhere to the former opinion; and my reaſons are briefly theſe:</p>
                  <p>This bird, according to Bontius, reſembles the Raven in the ſhape of its bill and in its part; though its neck is rather longer, and a ſlight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance appears in the figure riſing on the bill.</p>
                  <p>This is a certain proof that he knew no other bird to which he could ſo readily compare it, and yet he was acquainted with the Calao of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1084500103:49"/>
India. He tells us indeed that it feeds upon nutmegs; and Willoughby conſiders this feature as different from the character of the Common Ravens; but we have already ſeen that theſe eat wild nuts, and are not ſo much carnivorous as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, neither the deſcription of Bontius nor his figure diſcovers the leaſt trace of the indenting of the bill, which Briſſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards as one of the characters of the Calaos; and the little bump which appears on the bill bears no reſemblance to the protuberance which diſtinguiſhes the Calao. Laſtly, the Calao has neither the ſpeckled temples, nor the black tail quills which are mentioned in the deſcription of Bontius; and its bill is ſo ſingularly ſhaped, that an obſerver could not, I ſhould ſuppoſe, have ſeen it, and not remarked its form, much leſs have taken it for the bill of a Common Raven.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh of the Indian Raven of Bontius has a pleaſant aromatic flavour, derived from the nutmegs, which conſtitute its principal food; and it is extremely probable that if our Raven had the ſame ſort of aliments, it would loſe its rank ſmell<note n="*" place="bottom">Linnaean character of Bontius' Indian Raven: <q rend="inline">Its front bony, plain, and bare before, its belly yellow.</q> It is often tamed, and employed to catch rats and mice: it is thirty inches long.</note>.</p>
                  <p>It would require to have ſeen the Raven of the Deſert <hi>(graab el zahara),</hi> which Dr. Shaw
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1084500103:50"/>
mentions<note n="*" place="bottom">Shaw gives it alſo the names <hi>Crow of the deſert, Red-legged Crow,</hi> or <hi>Pyrrhocorax.</hi>
                     </note>, to be able to refer it with certainty to its analogous European ſpecies. All that the Doctor ſays is, that it is rather larger than our Raven, and that its bill and feet are red. This laſt character has determined Dr. Shaw to reckon it a large Chough; that bird, as we have already ſeen, is indeed known in Africa; but how can we conceive a Chough to be greater than a Raven? I mention this to draw the attention of ſome intelligent traveller.</p>
                  <p>I find in Koempfer two other birds mentioned by the name of Ravens, without a ſingle cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to juſtify that appellation. The one is, according to him, of a middle ſize, but extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly audacious; it was brought from China to Japan as a preſent to the emperor. The other, which was alſo given to the emperor of Japan, was a bird from Corea, exceedingly rare, and called <hi>Coreigaras</hi>; that is, the Raven of Corea. Koempfer adds, that the Ravens which are common in Europe are not found in Japan, no more than the parrots and ſome other birds of India.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Note.</hi> We ſhould here place the Armenian bird, which Tournefort calls the <hi>King of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> if it were really a Raven, or belonged to that family. But a glance of the miniature figure will convince us that it is more related to the peacocks and pheaſants, by its beautiful creſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1084500103:51"/>
its rich plumage, its ſhort wing, and the ſhape of its bill, though it is ſomewhat longer, and though other ſlight differences occur in the form of its tail and of its feet. It is properly termed on the figure <hi>Avis Perſica pavoni congener</hi> (Perſian bird akin to the peacock); I ſhould therefore have mentioned it among the foreign birds analogous to the peacocks and pheaſants, if I had been earlier acquainted with it.]</p>

                  <p>THESE birds ſpend the ſummer in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive foreſts, from which they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally emerge to procure ſubſiſtence for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their infant brood. Their chief food in the ſpring is partridges eggs, of which they are very fond, and are ſo dexterous as to pierce them and carry them on the point of the bill to their young. The conſumption is prodigious; and though they are not the moſt ſanguinary of the rapacious tribe, we may reckon them the moſt deſtructive. Fortunately, they are not numerous; we ſhould hardly find two dozen of pairs in a foreſt of five or ſix miles compaſs in the environs of Paris.</p>
                  <p>During winter they live with the Rooks and Hooded Crows, and nearly in the ſame way. In this ſeaſon, numerous flights of all ſorts of

                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:1084500103:54"/> Crows aſſemble about our dwellings, keeping
conſtantly on the ground, ſauntering among our flocks and ſhepherds,
hovering near the tracks of our labourers, and ſometimes hopping upon the
backs of hogs and ſheep, with ſuch famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, that they might be taken
for tame domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic birds. At night they retire into the foreſts to lodge on
the large trees, which they ſeem to chooſe as the general rendezvous,
whither they reſort from every quarter, ſometimes from the diſtance of
three miles all round, and whence they again ſally out in the morning in
queſt of ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>But this mode of life, which is common to the three ſpecies of Crows, is not equally ſuited to them all; for the Hooded Crows and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion Crows become exceſſively fat, while the Rooks continue always lean. But this is not the only difference that ſubſiſts; towards the end of winter, which is the ſeaſon of their amours, the Rooks remove into other climates, while the Carrion Crows, which diſappear at the ſame time in the plains, make only a partial flitting, and retire into the next large foreſts, where they diſſolve the general ſociety to form new connexions more endearing and more intimate. They form into pairs, and ſeem to divide their territory into diſtricts of about a quarter of a league in diameter, each of which maintains its ſeparate family<note n="*" place="bottom">This has perhaps given occaſion to ſay, that Ravens expel their young from their diſtrict as ſoon as theſe are able to fly.</note>. It is ſaid that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1084500103:55"/>
this connexion ſubſiſts inviolate during the reſt of their life; and it is even alleged that if one of the couple happen to die the ſurvivor will never enter into another union.</p>
                  <p>The female is diſtinguiſhed by her plumage, which is of inferior luſtre. She lays five or ſix eggs, and ſits about three weeks, during which time the male ſupplies her with food.</p>
                  <p>I had an opportunity of examining a neſt of a Crow which was brought to me in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of July. It was found in an oak eight feet high, in a wood planted on a little hill, where were other oaks larger. The neſt weighed two or three pounds; it was formed on the outſide with ſmall branches and thorns rudely interwoven, and plaiſtered with earth and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung; the inſide was ſofter, and lined carefully with fibrous roots. I found in it ſix young already hatched, all alive, though they had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours; their eyes were not open<note n="*" place="bottom">See <bibl>Ariſtotle <hi>de Generatione,</hi> lib. iv. 6.</bibl>
                     </note>, and no plumage was to be ſeen on them except the point of the wing quills; their fleſh was a mixture of yellow and black; the tip of the bill and their nails yellow; the edges of the mouth a dirty white, and the reſt of the bill and feet reddiſh.</p>
                  <p>When a buzzard or keſtril approaches the neſt, the parents unite to attack them, and dart with ſuch fury that they often kill them, ſplitting the ſkull with their bills. They alſo fight with the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1084500103:56"/>
ſhrikes; but theſe, though ſmaller, are ſo bold as often to prove victorious, drive them from the neſt, and plunder the young.</p>
                  <p>The ancients aſſert, that the Crows as well as the Ravens are watchful of their young after the period of their flight<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Ariſtotle, <hi>Hiſt. Anim.</hi> lib. vi. 6.</bibl>

This ſeems to be probable, and I ſhould ſuppoſe that they do not ſeparate from their parents the firſt year; for theſe birds readily aſſociate with ſtrangers, and is it not natural to ſuppoſe that the ſociety which is formed in the ſame family will continue to ſubſiſt till interrupted by the breeding ſeaſon?</p>
                  <p>Like the Raven, the Crow can be taught to prattle; it is alſo omnivorous: inſects, worms, birds eggs, fiſh, grain, fruits, every thing, in ſhort, is ſuited to it. It breaks nuts by dropping them from a height<note n="†" place="bottom">

Its weight is ten or twelve ounces; it has twelve tail feathers, all equal, and twenty in each wing, of which the firſt is the ſhorteſt and the fourth the longeſt; its wings ſpread three feet; the aperture of the noſtrils is round, covered with a ſort of briſtles projecting forward; it has ſome black ſpecks round the eyelids; the outer toe of each foot is united to that of the middle at the firſt joint; the tongue is forked and ſlender; the ventricle ſomewhat muſcular; the inteſtines rolled into a great number of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions; the <hi>coeca</hi> half an inch long; the gall bladder large, and communicating with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinal tube by a double duct<note n="*" place="bottom">Willoughby.</note>.

A Carrion Crow is faſtened alive on its back firmly to the ground, by means of a brace on each ſide at the origin of the wings. In this painful poſture the animal ſtruggles and ſcreams; the reſt of its ſpecies flock to its cries from all quarters, with the intention, as it were, to afford relief. But the priſoner, graſping at every thing within reach to extricate himſelf from his ſituation, ſeizes with his bill and claws, which are left at liberty, all that come near him, and thus delivers them a prey to the bird-catcher<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. They are alſo caught with cones of paper baited with raw fleſh; as the Crow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces his head to devour the bait, which is near the bottom, the paper, being beſmeared with birdlime, ſticks to the feathers of the neck, and he remains hooded, unable to get rid of this bandage, which covers his eyes entirely; he betakes to flight, riſes almoſt perpendicularly into the air, the better to avoid ſtriking againſt any thing, till quite exhauſted, he ſinks down always near the ſpot from which he mounted.

                  <p>It is very probable that the Crows of the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divas, mentioned by Francis Pyrard, are of the ſame kind; ſince that traveller, who ſaw them very diſtinctly, remarks no difference. They ſeem however to be more familiar and bolder than ours; for they entered houſes to pick up whatever ſuited them, and often the preſence of a man did not diſcompoſe them. Another tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller ſays, that theſe Indian Crows, when they can get into a chamber, delight in doing all the miſchievous tricks that are aſcribed to monkeys; derange the furniture, and tear it with their bills, overturn lamps, ink-ſtands, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>THIS bird is of an intermediate ſize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Raven and the Carrion Crow, and it has a deeper cry than them. What diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes it the moſt, is a naked white ſkin, ſcaly and ſometimes ſcabby, that encircles the baſe of the bill, inſtead of thoſe black projecting feathers, which in the other ſpecies of Crows extend as far as the aperture of the noſtrils. Its belly is not ſo thick or ſtrong, and ſeems, as it were, raſped. Theſe differences, apparently ſo ſuperficial, imply more radical diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>The peculiarities of the Rook reſult from its mode of life. It feeds upon grain, roots, and worms; and as in ſearch of its proper ſubſiſtence, it ſcratches deep in the ground with its bill, which in time becomes rough, the feathers at the baſe are worn off by the continual rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing<note n="*" place="bottom">Daubenton the younger, keeper and demonſtrator of the cabinet of natural hiſtory, made an obſervation lately in a jaunt to the country, which relates to the preſent ſubject. This natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, to whom ornithology already owes ſo much, ſaw at a diſtance, in a field entirely uncultivated, ſix Crows of which he could not diſtinguiſh the ſpecies, which ſeemed very buſy lifting and turning over the ſtones that were ſcattered here and there, to get the worms and inſects lodged under them. They went ſo briſkly to work, that they made the ſmaller ſtones ſpring two or three feet. If this ſingular exerciſe, which no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before has attributed to the Crows, be familiar to the Rooks, it will afford another reaſon for the wearing and dropping of the feathers that encircle the baſe of their bill. In that caſe the name <hi>turnſtone,</hi> now applied to a ſingle ſpecies of bird, might become generic.</note>.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1084500103:62"/>
However, the ſtraggling feathers are perceived there; a ſufficient proof that the bird is not naturally bald.</p>
                  <p>The appetite of the Rook is confined to grain, worms, and inſects; it never prowls in the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, nor eats any ſort of fleſh: it has alſo the muſcular ventricle and the broad inteſtines of the granivorous tribe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds fly in numerous flocks, which are ſometimes ſo immenſe as to darken the air. We may conceive what havock theſe hordes of reapers will commit on newly-ſown fields, or on crops nearly ripe. Accordingly, in ſome countries government has interfered<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>. The Britiſh Zoology vindicates them from the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, aſſerting that they do more good than harm, by deſtroying the caterpillars that gnaw the roots of the uſeful plants, and blaſt the honeſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1084500103:63"/>
labours of the huſbandman. It would require a calculation to decide the point.</p>
                  <p>But not only the Rooks fly in flocks, they alſo neſtle in company, as it were, with thoſe of their own ſpecies; and their ſociety is very clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, eſpecially when they have young. Ten or twelve neſts are ſometimes found on the ſame tree, and a great number of trees thus furniſhed occur in the ſame foreſt, or rather in the ſame diſtrict<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>. They ſeek not retirement and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but rather prefer ſettling near our dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Schwenckfeld obſerves, that they commonly prefer the large trees planted round cemeteries; becauſe perhaps theſe are frequented ſpots, or afford worms in greater plenty; for we cannot ſuppoſe that they are attracted by the ſcent of the dead bodies, ſince we have already ſaid that they will not touch fleſh. Friſch aſſerts, that if, in the breeding ſeaſon, a perſon goes under the tree on which they are thus ſettled, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly be deluged with their excrements.</p>
                  <p>One circumſtance will appear ſingular, though very like to what happens every day among animals of a different ſpecies. When a pair are employed in conſtructing their neſt, one muſt be left to guard it, while the other is procuring the ſuitable materials; without this precaution, it is alleged, the neſt would in an inſtant be completely pillaged by the other Rooks which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1084500103:64"/>
are ſettled on the ſame tree, each carrying off a ſprig to its own dwelling.</p>
                  <p>Theſe birds begin to build their neſt in the month of March, at leaſt in England<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                     </note>. They lay four or five eggs, ſmaller than thoſe of the Raven, but marked with broader ſpots, eſpecially at the large end. It is ſaid that the male and female ſit by turns. When the young are hatched, and able to eat, they diſgorge their food, which they keep in reſerve in their craw, or rather in a ſort of bag formed by the dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the oeſophagus<note n="†" place="bottom">Willoughby.</note>.</p>
                  <p>I find in the Britiſh Zoology, that after their hatch is over, they leave the trees where they neſtled; and that they return not again till the month of Auguſt, and only begin to repair or rebuild their neſts in October<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is ſaid that the herons take advantage of their abſence to lay and hatch in their neſts. <bibl>ALDROVANDUS.</bibl>
                     </note>. This would ſhew that they continue almoſt the whole year in England; but in France, in Sileſia, and in many other countries, they are undoubtedly birds of paſſage, if we except a few; the only difference is, that in France they announce the winter, while in Sileſia they are the forerunners of the ſummer<note n="§" place="bottom">See <bibl>Schwenckfeld, p. 243.</bibl> At Baume-la-Roche, which is a village of Burgundy, a few leagues from Dijon, ſurrounded with mountains and craggy rocks, and where the air is ſenſibly colder than at Dijon, I ſaw repeatedly in ſummer a flock of Rooks which had lodged and neſtled above a century, I am aſſured, in the holes of rocks facing the ſouth weſt, and where it would be very difficult to get at their neſts, and not without being let down by cords. Theſe Rooks were ſo familiar that they ventured to ſteal the reapers' luncheons: they diſappeared about the end of ſummer a couple of months only, after which they returned to their uſual haunt. For theſe two or three years paſt they have not been ſeen, and their place was immediately occupied by the hooded Crows.</note>.</p>

The Rook is an inhabitant of Europe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Linnaeus; but it would appear that there are ſome exceptions, ſince Aldrovandus is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that there are none in Italy.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid that the young ones are good eating, and that even the old ones are tolerable food when fat, but this is very rare.

                  <p>Like the Rook alſo, the Hooded-Crows change their abode twice a-year, and may perhaps be conſidered as birds of paſſage; for we annually perceive immenſe flocks arrive near the middle of autumn, and depart about the beginning of ſpring, ſhaping their courſe towards the north; but we are uncertain where they ſtop. Moſt authors aſſert, that they paſs the ſummer on the loſty mountains<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus, Schwenckfeld, and Belon.</note>, and build their neſts in the pines or firs; it muſt therefore be on mountains uninhabited and little known, as in thoſe of the Shetland iſles, where they are actually ſaid to breed<note n="†" place="bottom">

and even putrid fleſh, and, above all, on the products of milk<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>; and though theſe facts would rank it among the omnivorous tribe, yet as ſeeds of various kinds, mixed with ſmall ſtones, are found in its ſtomach<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner and Ray.</note>, we may infer, that they are the neareſt allied to the granivorous ſpecies; and this is another trait in their character common to the Rook. In other reſpects, they reſemble much the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion-Crow; they have nearly the ſame ſize, the ſame port, the ſame cry, and the ſame flight; the ſtructure of their tail, wings, bill, and feet; the diſpoſition of their internal parts, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame<note n="‡" place="bottom">Willoughby.</note>; and if any difference can be perceived, they incline to the nature of the Rook.

A flight of theſe Crows has reſided conſtantly, for two or three years paſt, at Baume-la Roche, in certain holes of rocks, poſſeſſed above a century by Rooks. One year, theſe Rooks not having returned, a flock of fifteen or twenty Hooded-Crows immediately occupied their ſcite, have ſince had two hatches, and are at preſent (26th May 1773) engaged with a third.

Analogies ſo ſtriking to the Carrion-Crow and the Rook, would lead us to ſuſpect that the Hooded-Crow is only the hybridous offspring of theſe two ſpecies. If it were only a variety of the Carrion-Crow, why does it fly in flocks, and ſhift its abode twice a-year<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>Friſch ſays, that the Hooded-Crow has two cries; the one hollow and well-known, the other ſhrill and ſomewhat reſembling the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Cock.

Linnaeus ſeems to apply to this bird what is ſaid in the Britiſh Zoology with reſpect to the Rook, that it is uſeful in deſtroying deſtructive inſects.

                  <p>This foreign Crow ſeems to be modelled from ours, only its tail and feet are ſmaller; its plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is black, like that of the Carrion-Crow.

               <p>THESE birds are nearly related to the Crows; to inſtitute a compariſon between them would therefore throw light on the hiſtory of both. As there are three ſpecies of Crows, the black (the Carrion-Crow), the cinereous (the Hooded-Crow), and the bald (the Rook); ſo there are three correſponding ones among the Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws: a black one (the Daw, properly ſo called); a cinereous (the Chough); and a bald. The only difference is, that the laſt is of America, and has little black in its plumage. In general the Jackdaws are ſmaller than the Crows; their cry, at leaſt that of the two European ſpecies, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1084500103:77"/>
only kinds known to us, is ſhriller, and has influence in the forming of their names; ſuch as <hi>Choucas, Graccus, Kaw, Kae,</hi> &amp;c. But it appears that they have more than one inflexion of voice; for I am aſſured that they ſometimes call out <hi>tian, tian, tian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They live upon inſects, grain, fruits, and even fleſh, though very rarely; but they will not touch filth, nor do they haunt the coaſts to pick up the dead fiſh and other carcaſes that are caſt aſhore by the ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>. In this circumſtance they reſemble more the Rook, and even the Hooded-Crow, than the Carrion-Crow; but they approach the latter by the habit of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hunting for partridge eggs, of which they deſtroy great numbers.</p>
               <p>They fly in large flocks, like the Rooks; like theſe, too, they form a ſort of cantonments, which are even more numerous, conſiſting of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of neſts crouded upon one another, in a large tree, in a belfry, or in the ruins of an old deſerted caſtle<note n="†" place="bottom">Belon, Aldrovandus, and Willoughby. They prefer the holes of trees to the branches.</note>. The male and female, when once paired, remain a long time ſteadily united. When the genial ſeaſon returns, which awakens the ſenſibility of the animal frame, they eagerly court each other's ſociety, and prattle inceſſantly; they toy and kiſs, till they are worked up to a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1084500103:78"/>
fury which can no longer be ſatisfied with the calmer joys: nor do they omit theſe prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries when reduced to the ſtate of captivity<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ariſtotle, <hi>de Generatione,</hi> lib. iii. 6.</bibl>
                  </note>. After fecundation, the female lays five or ſix eggs, marked with a few brown ſpots on a greeniſh ground; and, after the young are hatched, ſhe watches, feeds, and rears them with an affection which the male is eager to ſhare. In this reſpect the Jackdaw reſembles the Crows, eſpecially the common ſort: but Charleton and Schwenckfeld aſſert that it has two hatches in the year; which has never been affirmed of any of the Crows, though it well correſponds to the order of nature, the ſmall ſpecies being always the moſt prolific.</p>
               <p>The Jackdaws are birds of paſſage, though they are not ſo well entitled to that appellation as the Rooks and Hooded-Crows, ſince a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them continue in the country through the ſummer. The towers of Vincennes are at every ſeaſon ſtocked with them, and ſo are all old buildings which afford the ſame convenience and ſhelter; but in France there are always fewer in ſummer than in winter. Thoſe which migrate, form themſelves into great bodies, like the Rooks and the Hooded-Crows; ſometimes they join the ſame army, and continually chatter as they fly: yet they keep not the ſame periods in France as in Germany; for they leave Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1084500103:79"/>
in autumn with their young, and appear not again till the ſpring, after having wintered with us; and Friſch was right in maintaining that they do not hatch during their abſence, ſince neither the Jackdaws nor other birds breed in winter.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to their internal ſtructure, I ſhall only obſerve that they have a muſcular ventricle, and near its ſuperior orifice a dilatation of the oeſophagus, which ſerves in place of a crop, as in the Crows, but that the gall-bladder is more elongated.</p>
               <p>They can be eaſily tamed and taught to ſpeak. They ſeem fond of the domeſtic ſtate; but they are faithleſs ſervants, concealing the food which they cannot conſume, and ſecreting bits of money and jewels.</p>
               <p>To complete the hiſtory of the Jackdaws, we have only to compare together the two kinds which are natives of Europe, and afterwards ſubjoin, as uſual, the foreign ſpecies and varieties.</p>
               <p>THE COMMON JACKDAW<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Choucas,</hi> Buff.</note> is of the ſize of a pigeon; its iris is whitiſh, it has ſome white ſtreaks under its throat, ſome dots of the ſame colour round its noſtrils, and ſome of an aſh colour on the hind part of the head and neck; the reſt is entirely black, which is deeper, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1084500103:80"/>
on the upper parts, and gloſſed ſometimes with violet, ſometimes with green.</p>
               <p>THE CHOUGH<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Chouc,</hi> BUFF. This is the <hi>Monedula Nigra</hi> of Briſſon, which Linnaeus makes to be a variety of the Common Jackdaw, <hi>Corvus Monedula.</hi>
                  </note> differs from the preceding, in being rather ſmaller, and perhaps leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; its iris is bluiſh, as in the Rooks; the prevailing colour of its plumage is black, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cinereous mixture, and ſmall white points are obſerved round its eyes. But in every other reſpect they are exactly alike, and there is no reaſon to doubt that they belong to the ſame ſpecies, and would breed together.</p>
               <p>We need not be ſurpriſed that birds ſo nearly related to the Crows, ſhould preſent the ſame varieties. Aldrovandus ſaw in Italy a Jackdaw with a white collar; this is probably the ſame with what is found in many parts of Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and which for this reaſon the Engliſh call the <hi>Helvetian Daw</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Monedula-Torquata</hi> of Briſſon, which Linnaeus regards as a variety. The <hi>Collared-Jackdaw</hi> of Latham.</note>.</p>
               <p>Schwenckfeld had occaſion to ſee a white Daw, with a yellowiſh bill. Theſe white Daws are more common in Norway and the cold countries; in the temperate climates even, as in Poland, a ſmall white Daw is ſometimes found in the neſt of the black Daws or Choughs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rzacynzki.</note>: in this caſe the colour of the plumage does not depend on the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1084500103:81"/>
influence of climate, but ariſes from a natural defect; in the ſame way as white Ravens are bred in France, and white Negroes born in Africa.</p>
               <p>Schwenckfeld ſpeaks: 1 ſt, of a variegated Daw, which reſembles the true Jackdaw, except that its wings are white, and its bill hooked. 2. Another Daw, which is very rare, and differs from the common kind in its being croſſed<note n="*" place="bottom">I had this year, in my court yard, four tufted hens, of a Flemiſh breed, which had the bill croſſed; the upper mandible was very hooked, and at leaſt as much ſo as in the croſs-bill it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the lower was almoſt ſtraight. Theſe hens could not feed on the ground ſo well as others; it was neceſſary that grain ſhould be laid of a conſiderable thickneſs.</note>. But theſe are, perhaps, individual varieties, or monſtrous productions.  <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Jackdaw, <hi>Corvus Monedula,</hi> LINN. <q rend="inline">It is duſky, the back of its head hoary, its wings and tail black.</q> The Jackdaw weighs nine ounces; its length thirteen inches, and its breadth twenty-eight. It is found as far north as Sondmor, and ſometimes in the Feroe iſlands; it leaves Smoland and Eaſt Gothland immediately after harveſt, and returns in the ſpring with the ſtares.—Mr. White, in his Natural Hiſtory of Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, relates a ſingular fact: That, in a neighbouring warren, the Daws ſometimes breed under ground in the rabbit-burrows.</note>

               <p>PLINY calls this bird <hi>Pyrrhocorax,</hi> which name alone includes an abridged deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Korax,</hi> which ſignifies Crow, marks the blackneſs of its plumage, as well as the analogy of its ſpecies; and <hi>pyrrhos,</hi> which means rufous or orange, denotes the colour of its bill, which, in fact, varies between yellow and orange; and alſo that of its feet, which are ſtill more vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſince they were red in the ſubject examined by Geſner and black in the one deſcribed by Briſſon. That author mentions alſo their being ſometimes yellow, and others relate that they are yellow in winter, and red in ſummer. Theſe yellow feet and bill, which laſt is ſmaller than that of the Jackdaw, have made it be taken for the Blackbird, and termed the Great Alpine Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird. But if we draw a compariſon, we ſhall find that it approaches much nearer to the Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws, by the ſize of its body, the length of its
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1084500103:84"/>
wings, and even the ſhape of its bill, though ſlenderer, and by its noſtrils being covered with feathers, which are thinner, indeed, than in the Jackdaws.</p>
               <p>In the article of the Red-legged Crow, or Corniſh Chough, I have ſtated the difference between theſe two birds; which Belon, and ſome others who have not ſeen them, have confounded together.</p>
               <p>Pliny believed the <hi>Pyrrohocorax</hi> to be of the Alps<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>

                  </note>; but Geſner, who has accurately pointed out the diſtinction between it and the Red-legged Crow, ſays, that in certain parts of the country of the Griſons, this bird does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in winter; and in other parts that it is ſeen nearly the whole year, but that its favourite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, where it ſettles in numerous flocks, is the ſummit of lofty mountains. Theſe facts reſtrict ſomewhat the opinion of Pliny, but at the ſame time they confirm it.</p>
               <p>The Alpine Daw is of a middle ſize, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jackdaw and the Carrion-Crow: its bill is ſmaller, and more arched, than either; its cry is ſhriller, and more plaintive than the Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw, and by no means agreeable<note n="†" place="bottom">Schwenckfeld ſays, that the <hi>Pyrrhocorax,</hi> which he terms alſo the <hi>Night-Crow,</hi> is noiſy, eſpecially during the night, and ſeldom appears in the day; but I am not certain if Schwenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld means the ſame bird as I do, by that name.</note>.</p>

                  <p>This ſingular Daw correſponds to the Rook: the anterior part of its head is bare as in the Rook, and its throat is only ſhaded with a few ſtraggling feathers. Its relation to the Daws in general is marked by the length of its wings, the ſhape of its feet, its port, its bulk, and its wide noſtrils, which are almoſt round. But it differs becauſe its noſtrils are not covered with feathers, and are placed in a deep cavity on either ſide of the bill, and alſo becauſe its bill is broader near the baſe, and ſcalloped at the edges. I can ſay nothing with reſpect to its hiſtory. It has not even received a name in any treatiſe of ornithology.

                  <p>The prevailing colour of this bird (for we know only its ſurface) is an aſh-grey, deeper in the upper ſide, and lighter in the under, and diluting, by degrees, almoſt to white under the belly and the parts adjacent. There are only two exceptions to this uniformity of plumage: 1. A black ring, which ſurrounds the baſe of the bill, and extends as far as the eyes. 2. The great quills of the wings, which are of a blackiſh brown.</p>
                  <p>In this bird the noſtrils are, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, entirely covered with white feathers; the bill is nearly ſimilar, except that the ridge of the upper mandible is not round as in the Jackdaws, but angular as in the <hi>Colnud.</hi> It bears other relations alſo to the laſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles it in the proportions of its wings, which extend no farther than the middle of its tail; in the ſmallneſs of its feet, and in the ſhortneſs of its nails. In ſhort, we cannot heſitate to place it, as well as the preceding, between the Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws and the <hi>Colnuds.</hi> Its length, reckoning from the point of the bill to the extremity of the tail, is about thirteen inches.</p>

                  <p>I rank this bird after the Daws, though it differs from them in ſome reſpects, becauſe it is certainly more analogous to theſe, than to any birds of our continent.</p>
                  <p>Like No. II. it has a very broad bill at the baſe, and reſembles it alſo in another reſpect, in being bald; but this is in a diffeent way, the neck being almoſt naked and featherleſs. Its head is covered from the noſtrils incluſively, with a ſort of black velvet cap, conſiſting of ſmall ſtraight feathers, ſhort, interwoven, and very ſoft to the feel; theſe are more ſtraggling under the neck, and much more ſo under the ſides and in the hind part.</p>
                  <p>The Colnud is nearly of the ſize of our Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws, and we may add that it wears their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; for its plumage is entirely black, except

                  <p>I cannot prevail upon myſelf to give this bird the appellation of a Daw, as Briſſon has done; ſince, from his deſcription even, it appears to differ widely from them. Its wings extend only fifteen or ſixteen inches, and it is ſcarcely larger than a Blackbird: its bill is thicker and longer in proportion than in any of the European Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws; its feet ſlenderer, and its tail forked;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1084500103:92"/>
laſtly, inſtead of the ſhrill gloomy cries of the Jackdaws, it has a ſoft pleaſant ſong. Such differences would lead us to expect many more, when the bird is better known.</p>

In fact, the Magpie has the bill, the feet, the eyes, and the general ſhape of the crows and jackdaws; it has alſo many of their inſtincts and habits, for it is omnivorous, living on all ſorts of fruits, and devouring even carrion<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>It is much ſmaller than even the jackdaw, not weighing more than eight or nine ounces; its wings are ſhorter, and its tail longer in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and hence its flight is neither ſo lofty, nor ſo well ſupported.

Since Ariſtotle is ſilent on theſe particulars, I conjecture that his Magpie and ours are the ſame bird, and likewiſe the long-tailed variegated Magpie which was new at Rome, and rare even in the time of Pliny. <bibl>

It was for the ſame reaſon that the tyrant Dionyſius had thirty bed-chambers.</note>. The eggs of the Magpie are never ſo large, or of ſo deep a colour, as thoſe of the Raven; they are marked with brown ſpots, ſtrewed on a blue-green ground, moſt crowded about the thick end. John Liebault, quoted by Salerne, is the only one who affirms that the male and female ſit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſomewhat leſs than ours; but its wings, being proportionably longer, are nearly of the ſame extent; its tail, on the contrary, is ſhorter, though of the ſame ſhape. The bill, the feet, and the nails, are black, as in the common Magpie, but the plumage is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. It has not a particle of white, and all the colours are dull; the head, the neck, the back, and the breaſt, are black, with violet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; the quills of the tail and the great quills of the wings are brown. All the reſt is blackiſh, with different degrees of intenſity.</p>

                  <head>II. The JAMAICA MAGPIE.</head>
                  <p>This bird weighs only ſix ounces, and is about a third ſmaller than the common Magpie,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1084500103:107"/>
which it reſembles in its bill, its feet, and its tail.</p>
                  <p>The plumage of the male is black, with purple reflections; that of the female is brown, darker on the back and all the upper ſide of the body, and lighter under the belly.</p>
                  <p>They build their neſt on the branches of trees. They are found in every part of the iſland, but are moſt numerous at a diſtance from the ſcene of buſtle. After breeding, they quit their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments, and in autumn they ſpread over the ſettlements in ſuch prodigious multitudes, as ſometimes to darken the air. They fly thus in flocks for miles, and wherever they alight, they occaſion conſiderable damage to the planters. In winter, their reſource is to crowd to the barn-doors. Such facts would lead us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they are frugivorous; but they have a ſtrong ſmell, and their fleſh is rank and coarſe, and ſeldom eaten.</p>
                  <p>It follows from what I have ſaid, that this bird differs from our Magpie, not only in its mode of feeding, in its ſize, and in its plumage, but is beſides diſtinguiſhed by its being able to continue long on wing, by its aſſociating in numerous flocks, and by the rankneſs of its fleſh. The difference of ſex is attended with a ſtill greater in the colours. In ſhort, if we add that the common Magpie could not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the immenſe ocean which ſeparates the two continents, and could not ſupport the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1084500103:108"/>
cold of a northern paſſage, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the American Magpies to be analogous to ours, and their repreſentatives in the new world, but not derived from the ſame common ſtock.</p>

                     </note> of Mexico ſeems to bear a great reſemblance to this Jamaica Magpie; ſince, according to Fernandez, its tail is very long, and its ſize is inferior to that of the ſtare; its plumage is of a gloſſy black; it flies in nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous flocks, which are deſtructive to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated fields where they alight; it breeds in the ſpring, and its fleſh is tough and rank. In a word, this bird might be conſidered as a ſort of ſtare or jackdaw; but if we except the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, a jackdaw with a long tail reſembles much a Magpie.</p>
                  <p>It is quite different with reſpect to the iſana<note n="†" place="bottom">

The bill, indeed, the feet, and the plumage, have the ſame colours in both; but the iſana is larger, and its bill is twice as long: beſides, it prefers the coldeſt parts of Mexico, and in its inſtincts, its habits, and its cry, it reſembles the ſtare. It would be difficult, I imagine, to trace theſe characters in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1084500103:109"/>
the Jamaica Magpie of Cateſby; and, if it muſt be referred to the ſame genus, it ought at leaſt to be formed into a ſeparate ſpecies. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Fernandez, the only naturaliſt who has had an opportunity of viewing the bird, is ſurely of more weight than the artificial claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a ſyſtem-maker; and that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced obſerver ſays, that it bore a ſtronger analogy to the ſtare than to the Magpie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may be deceived in a ſubject of this kind, where our information is drawn from imperfect deſcriptions and inaccurate figures; I ſhall add, that the iſana has a ſort of jeering note, common to moſt of the birds termed American <hi>Magpies.</hi>

                  <p>Though Fernandez calls this bird a great ſtare, we may, from his own account, refer it to the genus of Magpies; for he tells us, that it would be exactly like the common jackdaw, if it were ſomewhat ſmaller, its tail and nails ſhorter, and its plumage of a purer black, and not mixed with blue.

                  <p>Seba has given this bird the appellation of the <hi>Bird of Paradiſe,</hi> as he has to almoſt all foreign birds with long tails. In this reſpect the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diole was entitled to the name, ſince its tail is double the extreme length of its body. But this tail is not formed as in the bird of paradiſe, for its quill feathers are furniſhed with vanes through their whole length, beſides many other differences.</p>
                  <p>White is the prevailing colour in this bird: we muſt only except the head and neck, which are black, with very bright purple reflections; the feet, which are of a light red; the wings, whoſe quills have black vanes, and the two middle ones of the tail, which ſtretch much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reſt, and which are marked with black along their ſhaft, from the baſe to half of their length.</p>
                  <p>The eyes of the Vardiole are lively, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with white; the baſe of the upper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible is ſhaded with little hair-like black fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that meet behind and cover the noſtrils; its wings are ſhort, and extend not beyond the origin of its tail. So far it reſembles the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie; but it differs on account of the ſhortneſs of its feet, which are only the half in proportion,

               <p>The principal one is the blue ſpot, or rather mail formed by various ſhades of blue, with which each of its wings is decorated, and which ſuffices to diſtinguiſh it, at leaſt, from all the other European birds. It has alſo on its forehead a tuft of ſmall feathers, black, blue, and white: in general its feathers have all a ſoft and ſilky feel, and it can at pleaſure raiſe and depreſs thoſe on its head. It is a fourth part leſs than the Magpie; its tail is ſhorter, and its

<note n="*" place="bottom">Belon.</note>.</p>
               <p>The male is diſtinguiſhed by the bulk of his head and the luſtre of his colours<note n="†" place="bottom">Olina.</note>. The old ones differ alſo from the young in their plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and hence the various inconſiſtent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Willoughby ſays, that in the Jay deſcribed by Aldrovandus, no tranſverſe ſpots appear on the tail. Its feet are gray, according to Belon; they are brown, verging on fleſh-colour, according to Briſſon, and our own obſervations.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Jays are of a petulant diſpoſition; they have keen ſenſations and briſk movements, and in their frequent burſts of rage they hurry into danger, and often entangle their head between two branches, and die thus ſuſpended in the air<note n="§" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>GESNER.</bibl> This inſtinct makes thoſe battles credible, which are ſaid to be fought between armies of Jays and thoſe of Magpies.</note>. When they feel reſtraint, their violence exceeds bounds; and hence, in a cage, they entirely loſe their beauty, by the continual rumpling, wearing, and breaking of their feathers.</p>
               <p>Their ordinary cry is harſh and frequent; they are alſo fond of imitating other birds whoſe notes are not more agreeable, ſuch as the keſtril, the tawny owl, &amp;c.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Friſch.</note> If they perceive in the wood a fox or other ravenous animal, they give
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1084500103:118"/>
a certain ſhrill ſcream, to alarm their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; they quickly aſſemble, preſuming that they ſhall be formidable by their numbers, or at leaſt by their noiſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>. This inſtinct, which the Jays have, of ſummoning their force, together with their violent antipathy to the brown owl, ſuggeſt ſeveral ways of enſnaring them, and the ſport is commonly very ſucceſsful<note n="†" place="bottom">Belon.</note>; for they are more petulant than the magpies, and by no means ſo ſuſpicious or crafty; nor is their natural cry ſo various, though they have great flexibility of throat, and have a turn for imitating all the cries and ſounds of animals which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually hear, and even human diſcourſe. The word <hi>Richard</hi> they can the moſt eaſily imitate. The have alſo, like the magpie, and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the daws, crows, and ravens, the habit of burying their ſuperfluous proviſions<note n="‡" place="bottom">Id.</note>, and of ſtealing whatever they can obtain. But they cannot always recognize the ſpot where they have buried their treaſure, or, like all miſers, they are more actuated by the fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on their ſtock, than by the deſire of uſing it; ſo that in the ſucceeding ſpring, the acorns and nuts that were concealed, perhaps forgotten, germinate in the earth, and their tender leaves diſcover the uſeleſs heap, though too late, to the frugal ſordid hoarders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1084500103:119"/>
The Jays breed in woods remote from human dwellings, preferring the moſt branchy oaks, whoſe trunks are entwined with ivy<note n="*" place="bottom">Olina.</note>: but they are not ſo artful and cautious as the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies in building their neſts. I have received many of theſe in the month of May; they were hollow hemiſpheres, formed with ſmall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven roots, open above, without any ſoft lining, and without any exterior defence. I always found them to contain four or five eggs; others ſay that the number is five or ſix. They were ſmaller than pigeons eggs, gray, with more or leſs of a greeniſh hue, and with ſmall ſpots faintly marked.</p>
               <p>The young undergo their moulting in July: they keep company with their parents till the ſucceeding ſpring<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>, when they ſeparate, to form new pairs. By this time the blue plate on their wings, which appears very early, has attained its higheſt beauty.</p>
               <p>In the domeſtic condition, to which they eaſily conform themſelves, they become accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to all ſorts of food, and live in this way eight or ten years<note n="‡" place="bottom">Olina, Friſch.</note>. In the ſtate of freedom, they feed not only on acorns and filberts, but on cheſnuts, peas, beans, ſorbs, gooſberries, cherries, raſberries, &amp;c. They alſo prey on the young of other birds, when they can ſurpriſe them in the neſt during the abſence of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1084500103:120"/>
and ſometimes they venture to attack the old ones, when they diſcover them entangled in ſnares; and in this caſe they advance with their uſual imprudence, and are often caught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch. <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>. Their fleſh, though not delicate, is eatable, particularly if it be boiled firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards roaſted.</p>
               <p>In Jays, the firſt phalanx of the outer toe is in each foot connected with that of the middle toe; the inſide of the mouth is black; the tongue of the ſame colour, forked, thin, membranous, and almoſt tranſparent; the gall-bladder is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; the ſtomach not ſo thick, and lined with weaker muſcles than the gizzard in the grani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous tribe. Their gullet muſt be very wide, for they ſwallow acorns, filberts, and even cheſnuts entire, like the ring-doves<note n="†" place="bottom">Belon.</note>; I know, however, that they never thus treat the flower-cup of a pink, though they are exceedingly fond of the ſeed which it contains. I have often admired their procedure: if a pink be thrown to them, they ſeize it greedily, and if others be offered, they continue to ſnatch them till their bill can hold no more. When they want to eat theſe, they lay aſide all the reſt but one, hold it with the right foot, and pluck off the petals one by one, keeping a watchful eye all the time, and caſting a glance on every ſide: at laſt, when the ſeed appears, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1084500103:121"/>
it greedily, and again begin to pluck a ſecond flower.</p>
               <p>This bird is found in Sweden, Scotland, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany, and Italy; and is, I believe, a native of every country in Europe, and even of the correſponding climates of Aſia.</p>
               <p>Pliny mentions a kind of Jays or magpies with five toes, which learned to ſpeak better than the reſt<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Lib. x. 42.</bibl>
                  </note>. This is not more wonderful than that there ſhould exiſt hens with five toes, eſpecially as the Jays become more familiar and domeſtic than hens; and we know well, that all animals which live with man, and feed richly, are ſubject to exuberance of growth. The pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langes of the toes might be multiplied in ſome individuals beyond the uſual number; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation which has been aſcribed too generally to every ſpecies<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>.</p>
               <p>But another variety, more generally known in this ſpecies, is the White Jay. It has the blue mark on the wings<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gerini.</note>, but is diſtinguiſhed from the common Jay by the almoſt univerſal whiteneſs of its plumage, which extends even to its bill and nails, and by the red colour of its eyes, a property obſerved in ſo many other white animals. But we muſt not imagine that this white complexion is entirely pure; it is often ſhaded with a yellowiſh tinge of various intenſity. In a ſubject which I examined, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1084500103:122"/>

                  <p>THIS new kind of Jay has been juſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into France. Its red bill is the more remarkable, as the whole of the fore-part of the head, the neck, and even the breaſt, is of a fine velvet black. The hind part of its head and neck is of a ſoft gray, which mixes in ſmall ſpots on the crown, with the black of the fore-part; the upper ſide of the body is brown, the under whitiſh. But to form a clear idea of the colours, we muſt ſuppoſe a violet tint ſpread over them all, except the black, deeper on the wings, fainter on the back, and ſtill more dilute under the belly. The tail is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and the wings exceed not one-third of its length, and each of its quills is marked with three colours, viz. a light violet at its origin, black at its middle, and white at its extremity;

The delicate green which prevails in the upper part of its body, extends on the one ſide over the ſix mid-quills of the tail, and on the other it advances, paſſing by inſenſible ſhades, and receiving, at the ſame time, a bluiſh tint, to join a ſort of white crown on the head. The baſe of the bill is ſurrounded with a fine blue, which appears again behind the eye, and

in the ſpace below it. A kind of black velvet, which covers the throat and all the fore-part of the neck, is contraſted at its upper margin with the fine blue colour, and at its lower to the jon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil yellow which is ſpread over the breaſt, the belly, and the three lateral quills on each ſide of the tail.

It is diſtinguiſhed only by its inferior ſize, by the colours of its plumage, and by the length and ſhape of its tail, which is tapered. Such ſlight differences might be aſcribed to climate;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1084500103:126"/>
but our Jay is unable to traverſe the intervening ocean. Till, therefore, we receive a fuller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the habits of the Brown Jay of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, we ſhall conſider it as one of the foreign ſpecies the moſt analogous to our Jay.</p>
                  <p>The upper ſide of the body is of a brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; the under ſide, and alſo the crown of the head, the throat, and the fore-part of the neck, are of a dirty white, which alſo appears at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the tail and wings.

They ſtore up berries in hollow trees; yet they are avaricious, and ſo bold as to viſit the huts of the natives, and pilfer whatever they can ſnatch, even ſalted meat.

                  <p>This bird is noted for the fine blue colour of its plumage, which, with a ſlight intermixture of white, black, and purple, is ſpread over all the upper part of its body, from the crown of the head to the extremity of the tail.</p>
                  <p>Its throat is white, with a tint of red; under it is a kind of black gorget, and ſtill lower a reddiſh zone, which melts by degrees into the gray and white that predominate in the lower part of the body. The feathers on the crown
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1084500103:130"/>
of the head are long, and the bird raiſes them at pleaſure like a creſt, which is larger and more beautiful than in our Jay: this is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on the front by a kind of black fillet, which, ſtretching on both ſides over a white ground as far as the nape, joins the branches of the gorget. This fillet is divided from the bottom of the upper mandible by a white line formed by the ſmall feathers which cover the noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>The tail is almoſt as long as the bird itſelf, and conſiſts of twelve ſtaged quills.</p>
                  <p>Cateſby remarks, that the American Jay has the ſame petulance in its actions as the common Jay; that its notes are leſs diſagreeable, and that the female is diſtinguiſhed from the male by its duller colours. Admitting this, Cateſby's figure muſt repreſent a female, and that of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a male; but the age of the bird muſt alſo affect the vivacity and perfection of its colours.</p>
                  <p>This Jay is brought from Carolina and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada; and in thoſe countries it muſt be very common, for many are ſent to Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character: <q rend="inline">The coverts of the wings are marked by black tranſverſe lines, its body is coerulean, its collar black.</q> It is twelve inches long.

               <p>THIS bird is diſtinguiſhed from the jays and magpies by the ſhape of its bill, which is ſtraighter, blunter, and compoſed of two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal pieces. Its inſtinct is alſo different, for it prefers the reſidence of high mountains, and its diſpoſition is not ſo much tinctured with cunning and ſuſpicion. However, it is cloſely related to theſe two ſpecies of birds; and moſt authors not fettered by their ſyſtems, have ranged it with the jays and magpies, and even with the jackdaws<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner, Turner, Klein, Willughby, Linnaeus, Friſch.</note>, which, it is well known, bear a great analogy to the magpies; but it is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1084500103:133"/>
aſſerted that it chatters more than any of theſe.</p>
               <p>Klein diſtinguiſhes two varieties of the Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracker; the one, ſpeckled like the ſtare, has a ſtrong angular bill, a long forked tongue, as in all the magpies; the other is of inferior ſize, and its bill (for he ſays nothing of the plumage) is more ſlender and rounder, compoſed of two unequal mandibles, the upper of which is the longer, and its tongue divided deeply, very ſhort, and almoſt loſt in the throat<note n="*" place="bottom">According to Willughby, the tongue ſeems not capable of reaching farther than the corners of the mouth, while the bill is cloſed; becauſe in that ſituation the cavity of the palate, which uſually correſponds to the tongue, is then filled by a protuberant ridge of the lower jaw, which here fits this cavity. He adds, that the bottom of the palate, and the ſides of the chaps, are roughened with little points.</note>.</p>
               <p>According to the ſame author, theſe two birds eat hazel-nuts; but the former breaks them, and the latter pierces them: they feed alſo on acorns, wild berries, the kernels of pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops, which they pluck dextrouſly, and even inſects. And laſtly, like the jays, the magpies, and the jackdaws, they conceal what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſume.</p>
               <p>Beſides the brilliancy of the plumage, the Nutcracker is remarkable for the triangular white ſpots which are ſpread over its whole body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the head. Theſe ſpots are ſmaller on the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1084500103:134"/>
upper part, and broader on the breaſt; their effect is the greater, as they are contraſted with the brown ground.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are moſt attached, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above, to mountainous ſituations. They are common in Auvergne, Savoy, Lorraine, Franche-Compté, Switzerland, the Bergamaſque, in Auſtria in the mountains which are covered with foreſts of pines. They alſo occur in Sweden, though only in the ſouthern parts of that country<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Though the Nutcrackers are not birds of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they fly ſometimes from the mountains to the plains. Friſch ſays, that flocks of them are often obſerved to accompany other birds into different parts of Germany, eſpecially where there are pine foreſts. But in 1754, great flights of them entered France, particularly Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, where there are few pines; they were ſo fatigued on their arrival, that they ſuffered themſelves to be caught by the hand<note n="‡" place="bottom">A ſkilful ornithologiſt of the town of Sarbourg. (Dr. Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinger, who is well acquainted with the birds of Lorraine, and to whom I am indebted for many facts relating to their inſtincts, their habits, and their migrations), informs me, that in the ſame year (1754) flights ſo numerous of Nutcrackers paſſed into Lorraine, that the woods and the fields were filled with them. Their ſtay laſted the whole month of October, and hunger had ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled them, that they were knocked down with ſticks. The ſame obſerver adds, that theſe birds appeared again in 1763, but in ſmaller numbers; that their paſſage is always in autumn, and that ſix or nine years commonly intervene between their viſits. This muſt be reſtricted to Lorraine; for in France, eſpecially in Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, the Nutcrackers appear much ſeldomer.</note>. One
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1084500103:135"/>
was killed in the month of October that ſame year at Moſtyn in Flintſhire, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have come from Germany. We may remark, that that year was exceedingly arid and hot, which muſt have dried up moſt of the ſprings, and have much affected thoſe fruits on which the Nutcrackers uſually feed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as on their arrival they ſeemed to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, and were caught by all ſorts of baits, it is probable that they were conſtrained to abandon their retreats for want of ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>One of the reaſons, it is ſaid, why the Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crackers do not ſettle and breed in the inviting climates, is the perpetual war waged againſt them by the proprietors of the woods, for the injuries which they commit on the large trees, by piercing the trunks, like the wood-peckers<note n="*" place="bottom">Salerne.</note>. Part of them is ſoon deſtroyed, and the reſt is forced to ſeek an aſylum in the deſert unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected foreſts.</p>

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1084500103:136"/>
Nor is this the only circumſtance in which they reſemble the Woodpeckers; they neſtle, like them, in the holes of trees, which, perhaps, they themſelves have formed; for the middle quills of the tail are alſo worn near the end<note n="*" place="bottom">Linnaeus.</note>, which ſhews that they, as well as the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peckers, clamber upon trees. In ſhort, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to have placed the Nutcrackers between the Woodpeckers and the Jays; and it is ſingular, that Willughby has given them this preciſe arrangement in his Ornithology, though his deſcription ſuggeſts no relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The iris is of a hazel-colour; the bill, the feet, and the nails black; the noſtrils round, ſhaded with whitiſh feathers, ſtraight, ſtiff, and projecting; the feathers of the wing and tail are blackiſh, without ſpots, but only terminated for the moſt part with white; though there are ſome varieties in the different individuals, and in the different deſcriptions, which ſeems to confirm the opinion of Klein with regard to the two races or varieties, which he admits into the ſpecies of the Nutcrackers.</p>
               <p>We cannot find, in writers of natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, any details with regard to their laying, their incubation, the training of their young, the duration of their life, &amp;c. for they haunt

               <p>On this principle, which appears to be well founded, I reduce, 1. The European Roller and the Shaga-Rag of Barbary, mentioned by Dr. Shaw, to the ſame ſpecies. 2. I range to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Abyſſinian and the Senegal Roller, with which Briſſon ſeems not to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. 3. I claſs together the Roller of Mindanao; that of Angola, which Briſſon makes his twelfth and thirteenth Rollers; and that of Goa, which Briſſon does not mention. 4. I exclude from the genus of Rollers the fifth ſpecies of Briſſon, or the Chineſe Roller, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a different bird, and is much more like the Cayenne <hi>Grivert,</hi> with which I ſhall claſs it: I ſhall place both of them, under the common name of <hi>Rolle,</hi> before the Rollers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1084500103:139"/>
they appear to form the intermediate ſhade between the Jays and the Rollers. 5. I transfer the Roller of the Antilles to the Jays, which is the ſixth ſpecies of Briſſon. 6. I leave among the birds of prey the <hi>Ytzquauhtli,</hi> of which Briſſon has made his ſeventh ſpecies of Roller, by the name of <hi>the Roller of New Spain,</hi> the hiſtory of which has been given after the Eagles. In fact, according to Fernandez, who is the original au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and even according to Seba, who copies him, it is really a bird of prey, devouring hares and rabbits, and conſequently is very different from the Rollers. Fernandez ſubjoins, that it is proper for falconry, and that its bulk is equal to that of a ram. 7. I omit alſo the <hi>Hoxetot,</hi> or Yellow Roller of Briſſon, which I have ranged after the magpies, as being more related to that kind than to any other. Laſtly, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Ococolin</hi> of Fernandez, for the reaſons already ſtated in the article of the quails; nor can I admit the <hi>Ococolin</hi> of Seba, which is very different from that of Fernandez, though it bears the ſame name; for it is of the ſize of a crow, its bill is thick and ſhort, its toes and nails very long, its eyes encircled with red <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillae,</hi> &amp;c.

The Rollers build, when it is in their power, on birches, and it is only when they cannot find theſe that they lodge in other trees<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>.

                     <q rend="inline">A ſportſman,</q> ſays M.

They pick up the ſmall ſeeds, roots, and worms which the plough throws to the ſurface, and even the grain that is lately ſown. When this ſupply fails them, they have recourſe to wild berries, caterpillars, graſshoppers, and even frogs<note n="*" place="bottom">Klein, Willughby, Schwenckfeld, Linnaeus.</note>. Schwenckfeld adds, that they ſometimes devour carrion; but this muſt be during winter, and only in caſes of abſolute want<note n="†" place="bottom">If they rake among garbage in ſummer, it muſt be for inſects.</note>; for they are in general regarded as not carnivorous, and Schwenckfeld himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks that they are very fat in autumn, and then are good eating<note n="‡" place="bottom">Friſch compares their fleſh to that of the ring-dove.</note>, which can hardly be ſaid of birds that feed on garbage.</p>
               <p>The Roller has long narrow noſtrils placed obliquely on the bill near its baſe, and open; the tongue is black, not forked, but ragged at the tip, and terminated towards the root by two forked appendices, one on each ſide; the palate is green, the gullet yellow, the ventricle of a ſaffron colour, the inteſtines about a foot long, and the <hi>caeca</hi> twenty-ſeven lines. The wings extend twenty-two inches, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twenty quills, or, according to others, of twenty-three, the ſecond of which is the longeſt of all.

               <p>Aldrovandus, who ſeems to have been well acquainted with theſe birds, and who lived in a country which they inhabit, aſſerts that the female differs much from the male, its bill being thicker, and its head, neck, breaſt, and belly of a cheſnut colour, bordering on aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gray, while the correſponding parts in the male are of the colour of the beryl, with different reflections of a duller green.

That of Angola is diſtinguiſhed from the other only by the length of the exterior quills of its tail, which is double that of the intermediate ones, and by ſlight variations of colour.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1084500103:152"/>
Briſſon, who makes two ſpecies of them, will confirm our conjecture of the identity of the two ſpecies. They are both nearly of the bulk of the European Roller, have the ſame general ſhape, its bill ſomewhat hooked, its naked noſtrils, its ſhort legs, its long toes, its long wings, and even the colours of its plumage, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently diſtributed: they are always blue, green, and brown, which are ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, ſometimes mixed, melted together, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many intermediate ſhades, and having va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflections. The bluiſh green, or ſea green, is however ſpread on the crown of the head; the brown, more or leſs intenſe, and more or leſs greeniſh, covers all the fore-part of the body, with ſome tints of violet on the throat; and the blue, the green, and all the ſhades which ariſe from their mixture, appear on the rump, the tail, the wings, and the belly: only the Mindanao Roller has under its breaſt a kind of orange tincture, which is not found in that of Angola.</p>
                  <p>To this opinion it will be objected, perhaps, that the kingdom of Angola is at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Bengal, and ſtill farther from the Philippines. But is it impoſſible, or is it not natural, that theſe birds ſhould be ſpread through the different parts of the ſame continent, or the neighbouring iſlands, which are connected with it perhaps by the continuation of the ſame
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1084500103:153"/>

Admitting this, if we aſcribe the ſlight differences between the Roller of Mindanao and that of Angola to the effect of age, we muſt reckon the latter the older; or if we impute them to the diſtinction of ſex, we muſt conſider it as the male: for we know that in the Rollers, the fine colours of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do not appear till the ſecond year; and it is a general principle, that in all birds, the male, when it differs from the female, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by an exuberance of growth, or a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior richneſs of plumage<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>The Royal Cabinet has lately received from Goa a new Roller, which is very like that of Mindanao. It differs only by its ſize, and by a ſort of collar, like wine-lees in colour, which graſps only the hind part of the neck, a little under the head. It has not, any more than the Angola Roller, the orange cincture of the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danao Roller; but if in this reſpect it differs from the latter, it is ſo much the more allied to the former, which is certainly of the ſame ſpecies.</p>

I place it among the Rollers, becauſe I know of no reaſon to exclude it; I therefore follow the opinion of Briſſon, till more perfect information confirm or deſtroy the temporary arrangement. The colours are different from thoſe which are common in the Rollers.

                  <p>I place this bird between the Rollers and the Birds of Paradiſe, as forming the ſhade which connects theſe two kinds, becauſe it ſeems to have the ſhape of the former, and to reſemble the latter by its ſmallneſs, and the ſituation of the eyes under and very near the junction of the mandibles, and by a ſort of natural velvet which covers the throat and part of the head. Beſides, the two long quills of the tail, which ſometimes occur in the European Roller, and which are much longer in that of Angola, is another analogical character that connects the genus of the Roller with that of the Bird of Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>The upper part of the body of this bird is of a vivid and brilliant orange, the under of a fine yellow; it has no black but under the throat, on part of the ſhoulders, and on the quills of the tail. The feathers which cover the hind part of the neck are long, narrow, flexible, and recline on each ſide over the lateral parts of the neck and breaſt.</p>

The feet and legs had been torn from the ſubject deſcribed and deſigned by Edwards, as if it had been a real Bird of Paradiſe; and this circumſtance probably led that naturaliſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to that genus, though it has none of the principal characters. The quills of the wings were wanting, though thoſe of the tail were complete; they were, as I have ſaid, twelve in number, and terminated with yellow. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuſpects that the quills of the wing are alſo black, whether becauſe they are of the ſame colour with thoſe of the tail, or that they were wanting in the individual which he obſerved; for dealers in birds, in drying the ſpecimens, pluck all the feathers which are of a bad colour, to increaſe the beauty of the plumage<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character:—<q rend="inline">It is of a fulvous-yellow; its bridle, the upper part of its throat, the primary coverts, and the tips of the tail-quills, black.</q> It is eight inches long.</note>.</p>

fowlers who ſell them, are accuſtomed, whether for the ſake of preſerving and tranſporting the ſpecimens with more eaſe, or perhaps of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing an error which is favourable to their intereſt, to dry the bird with its feathers, after having previouſly ſeparated the thighs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the entrails. This practice has been ſo long continued, as to have ſtrengthened the prejudice to ſuch a degree, that thoſe who firſt aſſerted the truth were, as uſual, regarded as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of credit<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The fable, that the Bird of Paradiſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flies, derived an appearance of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from the conſideration of the quantity of feathers with which it is furniſhed; for beſides thoſe common to other birds, it has many long feathers, which riſe on each ſide between the wing and the thigh, and which, extending much beyond the true tail, and mingling with it, form a ſort of falſe tail, which many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers have miſtaken. Theſe <hi>ſubalar</hi> feathers are what the naturaliſts term <hi>decompoſed</hi>; they are very light themſelves, and form a bunch

But if the wind be contrary, the abundance of plumage will rather obſtruct its motion; accordingly it is obſerved, that the bird of Paradiſe avoids the bluſtering gales<note n="†" place="bottom">The Arous conſiſt of five iſlands, and theſe birds inhabit only the middle ones; they never appear in the others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being naturally weak, they cannot withſtand high winds. <bibl>HELBIGIUS.</bibl>
                  </note>, and commonly ſettles in countries the leaſt ſubject to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe feathers are of the number of forty or fifty on each ſide, of unequal lengths; the greater part ſpread under the true tail, and others lie over it, without concealing it; for their texture is delicately ſlender, and almoſt tranſparent, which is very difficult to repreſent in a figure.</p>
               <p>Theſe feathers are highly eſteemed in India, and much ſought after. It is not more than a century ſince they were employed in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope for the ſame purpoſes as thoſe of the Oſtrich; and, indeed, their lightneſs and bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy make them elegant ornaments. But the prieſts of Aſia aſcribe to them miraculous vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which give them a new value in the eyes of the vulgar, and have procured the bird the appellation of the <hi>Bird of God.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:1084500103:165"/>
Next to this, the moſt remarkable property of the Bird of Paradiſe is thoſe two long fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which take their riſe above the true tail, and extend more than a foot beyond the falſe tail, formed by the ſubalar feathers. Theſe, indeed, are real filaments only at their middle; for at their origin and their termination, they are furniſhed with webs of the ordinary breadth. In the females the extremities are narrower, which, according to Briſſon, is the only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between it and the male<note n="*" place="bottom">The inhabitants of the country ſay, that the females are ſmaller than the males, according to J. Otto Helbigius.</note>.</p>
               <p>The head and throat are covered with a ſort of velvet, formed by ſmall erect feathers, which are ſhort, ſtiff, and cloſe; thoſe of the breaſt and back are longer, but always ſilky and ſoft to the feel. They are all of different colours, which vary according to the poſition and the light in which they are viewed.</p>
               <p>The head is very ſmall in proportion to the body; the eyes ſtill ſmaller, and placed very near the opening of the bill. Cluſius reckons only ten quills in the tail; but this aſſertion was certainly not founded on the examination of a living ſubject, and it is doubtful whether the plumage of a bird brought from ſo great a diſtance be entire, eſpecially as it is ſubject to an annual moulting, which laſts ſeveral months. During that time, which happens
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1084500103:166"/>
in the rainy ſeaſon, it lives concealed; but, in the beginning of Auguſt, after hatching, its feathers are reſtored, and in the months of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember and October, in which calm weather prevails, it flies in flocks, like the Stares in Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">Helbigius.</note>.</p>
               <p>This beautiful bird is not much diffuſed: it is almoſt entirely confined to that part of Aſia which produces the ſpiceries, and eſpecially the iſlands of Arou. It is known alſo in the part of New Guinea oppoſite to theſe iſlands; but the name which it there receives, <hi>Burung-Arou,</hi> ſeems to indicate its natal ſoil.</p>
               <p>Since warm regions of ſpices alone are proper for the Bird of Paradiſe, it probably ſubſiſts on ſome aromatic productions<note n="†" place="bottom">Tavernier remarks, that the Paradiſe Bird is very fond of nutmegs, and that it reſorts to eat them in the ſeaſon; that it paſſes in flocks, like thoſe which we obſerve of the thruſhes in the time of vintage, and that they are intoxicated by the nutmegs, and drop down. <bibl>

               <p>Cluſius mentions, on the authority of ſome mariners, who themſelves learned the fact from report, that there are two kinds of this bird; the one large and beautiful, which inhabits the iſlands of Arou; the other inferior to it in ſize and elegance, which is ſettled in the country of the Papous, next Gilolo<note n="*" place="bottom">J. Otto Helbigius ſpeaks of the ſpecies which is found in New Guinea, as not having in its tail the two long filaments which appear in that of the ſpecies of the Arou iſlands.</note>. Helbigius, who heard the ſame in the iſlands of Arou, adds, that the Birds of Paradiſe of New Guinea, or of the Papous, differ from thoſe of Arou, not only in point of ſize, but alſo in the colours of the plumage, which is white and yellowiſh. I ſhould regard theſe authorities as ſuſpicious, and inſufficient to found any general conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

being very expenſive articles of commerce, many other birds, with long tails and an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant plumage, have been paſſed on the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the public, and the legs and thighs pulled off, to conceal the fraud and enhance the price.

               <p>The two tufts <hi>(bouquets)</hi> which I regard as the diſtinctive character of this bird, appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the neck and at its origin. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſeveral narrow feathers of a yellow co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, marked near the point with a ſmall black ſpot, and which, inſtead of lying flat as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, ſtand erect, thoſe near the head at right angles, and the ſucceeding ones with ſmaller inclinations.</p>
               <p>Under the firſt tuft we perceive a ſecond, which is larger, but not ſo much raiſed, and more reclined: it is compoſed of long detached filaments, which ſprout from very ſhort ſhafts, and of which fifteen or twenty join together,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1084500103:174"/>
forming ſtraw-coloured feathers. Theſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeem to be cut ſquare at the end, and make angles, more or leſs acute, with the plane of the ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>This ſecond tuft is bounded on the right and left by common feathers, variegated with brown and orange, and is terminated behind by a reddiſh and ſhining brown ſpot, of a triangular ſhape, with the vertex turned towards the tail, and the filaments of the feathers looſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed, as in the ſecond tuft.</p>
               <p>Another characteriſtic feature of this bird is the two filaments of the tail, which are about a foot long and a line broad, and of a blue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, changing into a lucid green, and taking their origin above the tail. So far they much reſemble the filaments of the preceding ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but are of a different form, for they do not end in a point, and are furniſhed with webs on the middle only of the inner ſide.</p>
               <p>The middle of the neck and breaſt is marked from the throat by a row of very ſhort fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, diſplaying a ſeries of ſmall tranſverſe lines, which are alternately of a fine light green, changing into blue, and of a deep duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green.</p>
               <p>Brown is the prevailing colour on the lower belly, the rump, and the tail; ruſty yellow is that of the quills, the wings, and of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1084500103:175"/>
but the quills have more than one brown ſpot at their extremity, at leaſt this is the caſe in the ſpecimen preſerved in the Royal Cabinet; for it may be proper to mention that the long quills of the wings, as well as the feet, have been removed<note n="*" place="bottom">I know not whether the individual obſerved by Aldrovandus had the number of wing-quills very complete; but this author ſays that theſe quills were of a blackiſh colour.</note>.</p>
               <p>This bird is rather larger than the preceding; its bill is ſimilar, and the feathers of the front extend over the noſtrils, which they partly cover: this is inconſiſtent with the character that has been eſtabliſhed of theſe birds by one of our moſt intelligent ornithologiſts<note n="†" place="bottom">The feathers at the baſe of the bill turned back, and leaving the noſtrils bare. <bibl>BRISSON.</bibl>

               <p>I place this bird immediately after the Birds of Paradiſe, though it wants the filaments of the tail; but we may ſuppoſe that moulting, or ſome accidental cauſe, is the reaſon of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for in other reſpects it reſembles theſe birds, not only in its general ſhape, and in that of its bill, but is alſo related by the identity of climate, by the richneſs of its colours, and a certain ſuperabundance or luxuriancy of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which is peculiar to the Birds of Paradiſe: for there are two ſmall tufts of black feathers which cover the noſtrils, and two other bunches of the ſame colour, but much longer, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the oppoſite extremity.

               <p>If we adopt the filaments as the ſpecific cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Manucodes, the preſent is entitled to be ranged at their head; for inſtead of two, it has ſix, and of theſe not one riſes on the back, but all of them take their origin from the head, three on each ſide. They are half a foot long, and reflect backwards. They have no webs but at their extremity for the ſpace of ſix lines, and theſe are black and pretty long.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe filaments, this bird has two properties which belong to the Bird of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; luxuriancy of feathers and richneſs of colours.</p>

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:1084500103:178"/>
The luxuriancy of feathers conſiſts; 1. In a ſort of tuft compoſed of ſtiff narrow feathers, and which riſes at the baſe of the upper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. 2. In the length of the feathers of the belly and of the abdomen, which is four inches or more; one part of theſe feathers, extending directly, conceals the under-ſide of the tail, while another part, riſing obliquely on each ſide, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the upper ſurface of the tail as far as the third of its length, and all of them correſpond to the ſubalar feathers of the Bird of Paradiſe, and of the Manucode.</p>
               <p>With regard to the plumage, the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant colours appear on the neck; behind, it is gold-green and bronze violet; before, topaz-gold reflections, which wanton in all the ſhades of green, and derive new luſtre from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt with the darkneſs of the contiguous parts; for the head is black, changing into a deep violet, and the reſt of the body is brown, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to black, and with reflections of the ſame deep violet.</p>
               <p>The bill of this bird is nearly the ſame as in the Birds of Paradiſe; the only difference is, that its upper ridge is angular and ſharp, while in moſt of the other kinds it is rounded.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be ſaid with reſpect to the feet and the wings, becauſe they were extirpated in the ſubject from which this deſcription is drawn; a practice which, as we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,

The ſmall velvet feathers on its forehead project forwards as far as the noſtrils, which are deeper than in the preceding kinds.

               <p>BRISSON is the firſt who has deſcribed this little bird, which Adanſon brought from Senegal. It is ſcarcely larger than the creſted lark, and its wings extend only fourteen inches. Its plumage has nothing remarkable; in general a grayiſh brown prevails on the upper part of the body, and grayiſh yellow on the under. The bill is not of an invariable colour; in ſome individuals it is entirely brown; in others red at the point, and yellow at the baſe; in all it is nearly of a quadrangular ſhape, and the points of the two mandibles are reflected in a contrary direction. The tail is tapered in ſteps, and a ſingular circumſtance is obſerved, that the twelve quills, of which it conſiſts, are all pointed. Laſtly, the firſt <hi>phalanx</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior toe is cloſely connected to that of the mid-toe.</p>
               <p>This bird is very fond of certain worms, or the <hi>larvae</hi> of inſects, which lodge under the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermis in oxen. It alights on the backs of theſe animals, and pierces their ſkin with its bill, to extract theſe worms, and hence its name. </p>

               <p>FEW birds are ſo generally known, eſpecially in the temperate climates, as the Stare; for as it is a conſtant reſident of the diſtrict where it ſettles<note n="†" place="bottom">In the colder countries, however, ſuch as Sweden and Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, it is migratory. <q rend="inline">It deſcends after the middle of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into the low lands of Scania,</q> ſays <bibl>Linnaeus, <hi>Fauna Suecica,</hi> p. 70.</bibl>:  <q rend="inline">when they leave our country,</q> ſays <bibl>Geſner, <hi>de Avibus,</hi> p. 745.</bibl>
                  </note>, and as it can be trained in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſtate, its habits have been obſerved, whether when ſubjected to reſtraint, or ranging without controul.</p>
               <p>The Blackbird is that, of all the feathered race, which the Stare reſembles the moſt; their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1084500103:184"/>
young can hardly be diſtinguiſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>BELON.</bibl> So exact is the reſemblance between the young of theſe two ſpecies, that I once knew a law-ſuit grounded upon it. The appellant produced a well trained blackbird, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the recompence ſtipulated for rearing and educating it; but the defendant inſiſted, that the young bird which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in charge was a Stare.</note>: but after their characters are developed, the Stare is found to be diſtinguiſhed by the ſtreaks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of its plumage; by the blunter form of its bill, which is broader, and not ſcalloped near the point<note n="†" place="bottom">Barrere ſays, that the Stare has a quadrangular bill. He muſt at leaſt allow that the angles are very round.</note>; and by the greater flatneſs of its head, &amp;c. But another very remarkable difference, and which is derived from a more intimate cauſe is, that the ſpecies of the Stare is ſolitary in Europe; whereas the ſpecies of the Blackbird are extremely numerous.</p>
               <p>There is another circumſtance alſo in which theſe birds are analogous; they never change their reſidence during the winter. They only ſeek for thoſe ſpots in the tract where they are ſettled that have the beſt aſpect, and are in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of ſprings<note n="‡" place="bottom">This has probably led Ariſtotle to ſay, that the Stare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals itſelf well in winter.</note>; with this difference, however, that the Blackbirds ſtill continue to live ſolitary; whereas the Stares aſſemble after the breeding ſeaſon, in very numerous flocks: theſe fly in a peculiar manner, which would

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:1084500103:187"/> ſeem to be directed by a ſort of tactics. It is the
voice of inſtinct which inceſſantly impels the Stares toward the centre
of the battalion, while the rapidity of their motions hurries them beyond it; a
ſort of vortex is thus formed, denſer at the middle, and rarer near the
verge; and the collective body performs an uniform circular revolution, and at
the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to make a progreſſive advance. This mode of
flying has its advantages and its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies. The rapacious tribe is
diſconcerted by the whirling of the Stares, alarmed by their noiſy cries,
and deterred by the appearance of order. But the danger is increaſed of
falling a prey to the arts of man: the bird-catcher fixes a packthread
beſmeared with bird-lime to each foot, and thus diſcharges one or two
Stares; theſe mingle in the flock of their companions, and in their frequent
gyrations and rencounters entangle others, and a number of victims, after
waſting their efforts, tumble headlong to the ground.</p>
               <p>The evening is the time when the Stares aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in the greateſt numbers, to provide more effectually againſt the dangers of the night; which they commonly ſpend among the reeds, whither they haſten about the cloſe of the day, in a noiſy flight<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>OLINA.</bibl> He compares the noiſe of their paſſage through the air to the rattling of hail.</note>. They chatter much in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1084500103:188"/>
evening and morning, at the forming and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing of their forces; are leſs clamorous during the reſt of the day, and quite ſilent during the night.</p>
               <p>So attached are the Stares to ſociety, that they not only join thoſe of their own ſpecies, but alſo birds of a different kind. In the ſpring, before the breeding ſeaſon, they often aſſociate with the crows and jackdaws, and even with the red-wings and field-fares, and ſometimes with the pigeons.</p>
               <p>Their loves commence about the end of March. Violence decides their choice: they continue as noiſy as ever; their twitter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant; and to ſing and toy ſeem then their ſole occupation. The care of the expected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny ſucceeds; but they are not over-anxious in providing for the reception. They often take poſſeſſion of the neſt of a wood-pecker, which often retaliates in its turn. When they would conſtruct one for themſelves, they only heap a few dry leaves, ſome herbage or moſs, in the hole of a tree or of a wall. In this artleſs bed the female drops five or ſix eggs, of a greeniſh aſh-colour, and covers them for the ſpace of eighteen or twenty-one days. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe hatches in dove-cotes, in the roofs of dwelling-houſes, and even in the holes of rocks on the ſea-coaſt, as in the Iſle of Wight and

I have ſometimes received, in the month of May, neſts which were pretended to belong to the Stare, and to be found in trees; but as two of them reſemble exactly thoſe of the Thruſh, I ſuſpect that the perſons whom I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed wanted to impoſe on me, unleſs we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Stare had diſpoſſeſſed the Thruſh, and occupied its place. In ſome caſes, however, they make their own neſts; a ſkilful obſerver told me, that he has ſeen ſeveral of them on the ſame tree.

               <p>The feathers of the Stares are in general long and narrow, as Belon deſcribes; their colour is at firſt of a blackiſh-brown, uniform, and without ſtreaks or reflections. The ſtreaks begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after the firſt moulting, emerging about the end of July, on the lower part of the body, then on the head, and towards the 20th of Auguſt, are ſpread over the upper part of the body. I always mean the young Stares, which were hatched in the beginning of May.</p>
               <p>I have remarked, that in this firſt moulting, the feathers which ſurround the baſe of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1084500103:190"/>
bill, dropped almoſt all at once, ſo that this part was bald during the month of July<note n="*" place="bottom">I know not why Pliny, ſpeaking of the Stares, ſays, <q rend="inline">But theſe loſe not their feathers.</q>

                  </note>, as it happens conſtantly in the rook through the reſt of the year. I alſo obſerved that the bill was almoſt all yellow on the 15th of May; this ſoon changed into a horn colour, and Belon aſſures us, that in time it becomes orange.</p>
               <p>In the males, the eyes have a larger ſhare of brown, or it is more uniform<note n="†" place="bottom">

Beſides, the male is larger, weighing three ounces and a half. Salerne adds, another diſtinguiſhed character of the ſex is, that the tongue is pointed in the male, but forked in the female. It would appear that Linnaeus had ſeen it pointed in ſome individuals, and forked in others<note n="‡" place="bottom">

               <p>The Stares live on ſnails, worms, and cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars; eſpecially on thoſe large caterpillars of a

fine green, with reddiſh reflections, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in the month of June, upon the flowers, and chiefly upon the roſes. They feed alſo on wheat, buckwheat, millet, panic, hemp-ſeed, elder-berries, olives, cherries, raiſins, &amp;c. It is pretended that the laſt is what corrects beſt the natural bitterneſs of their fleſh, and that cherries are what they are the fondeſt of<note n="*" place="bottom">Schwenckfeld, Salerne, &amp;c. Cardan ſays, that to ſweeter the fleſh of Stares, we need only cut off their head as ſoon as they are killed: Albin directs them to be flayed: others allege, that the mountain Stares are better taſted than thoſe of the plains. But theſe authors can only mean the young birds, for the fleſh of the old ones is always bitter and unpalatable.</note>; and theſe afford an almoſt infallible bait for weel-nets, which are laid among the reeds, where they retire in the evenings; and in this way an hundred may often be caught in one night: but this diverſion laſts no longer than the ſeaſon of cherries.</p>
               <p>They are fond of following oxen and other large cattle as they feed in the meadows, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, it is ſaid, by the inſects which flutter round them, or by thoſe, perhaps, which ſwarm in their dung, or in meadows in general. From this habit is derived the German name <hi>Rinder-Staren.</hi> They are alſo accuſed of feeding on the carcaſſes that are expoſed on gibbets<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>; but it is probably in ſearch only of inſects. I have raiſed ſome of theſe birds, and have obſerved, that when bits of raw fleſh were offered to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1084500103:192"/>
them, they fixed on the prey with great avidity. If they were preſented with the flower-cup of a pink, containing ſeed already formed, they did not graſp it with their claws, and pluck it like the jay, but ſhook it and ſtruck it againſt the bars in the bottom of the cage, till the grains dropped out. I remarked alſo, that they drank nearly like the gallinaceous tribe, and took great delight in bathing. It is probable that one of thoſe which I raiſed died of cold, in conſequence of bathing too often during the winter.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds live ſeven or eight years, or even longer, in the domeſtic ſtate. The wild ones cannot be decoyed by the call, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the ſcream of the owl. But beſides the contrivance of the limed threads and the weel-nets, which I have already mentioned, a method has been fallen on to take entire families, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the walls and the trees where they lodge pots of earthen ware of a convenient form, which the birds often prefer to place their neſts in<note n="*" place="bottom">Olina and Schwenckfeld.</note>. Many are alſo caught by the gin and draw-net. In ſome parts of Italy it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to employ tame weaſels to drag them out of their neſts, or rather their holes; for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of man conſiſts in employing one enſlaved race to extend his dominion over the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Stares have the <hi>membrana nictitans</hi>; their noſtrils are half-ſheathed by a membrane; the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1084500103:193"/>
legs are of a reddiſh brown<note n="*" place="bottom">I know not why Willughby ſays that <q rend="inline">the legs are feathered to the toes.</q> I never found this in any of the Stares which I examined.</note>; the outer toe is connected to the mid one as far as the firſt <hi>pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx</hi>; the hind nail is ſtronger than the reſt; the gizzard is preceded by a dilatation of the <hi>aeſophagus,</hi> is a little fleſhy, and contains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmall ſtones.

               <p>In diſſecting a young Stare, one of thoſe which I had raiſed, I remarked that the contents of the gizzard and of the inteſtines were entirely black, though it had been fed on bread and milk only. This circumſtance denotes an abundance of black bile; and at the ſame time accounts for the bitterneſs of the fleſh of theſe birds, and the uſe which has been made of their excrements in the preparation of coſmetics.</p>

                  <p>THIS African bird reſembles in its general ſhape the Common Stare, and the black and white colours of its plumage are diſtributed as in the Magpie.</p>
                  <p>Were it not that its bill is thicker and longer than in the European Stare, we might regard it as merely a variety, eſpecially as our Stare is to be met with at the Cape of Good Hope; and this variety would coincide with the one already mentioned, in which the black and white are diſtributed in large ſpots. The moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character in this bird is a very large white ſpot, of a round ſhape, placed on each ſide of the head, and which ſtretches forward to the baſe of the bill, and incloſing the eye ſhoots into a ſort of appendix, variegated with black, that deſcends along its neck.</p>

                  <p>I have applied the name of <hi>Stourne,</hi> which is formed from the Latin <hi>Sturnus,</hi> to an American bird, which, though conſiderably different, is allied to our Stare. The under part of its body
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1084500103:199"/>
is gray, variegated with brown, and the upper is yellow. The moſt characteriſtic marks of this bird, in reſpect to colour, are, 1. A blackiſh plate intermixed with gray at the lower part of the neck, and riſing diſtinctly out of the yellow ground. 2. Three white bars on its head, which riſe from the baſe of the upper mandible, and extend as far as the <hi>occiput</hi>; the one reſts on the top of the head, while the two others, which are parallel to it, ſtretch on each ſide over the eyes. In general this bird reſembles the European Stare, by the proportions of its wings and tail, and alſo by the diſperſion of theſe colours in ſmall ſpots: its head is likewiſe flat, but its bill is longer.</p>
                  <p>A correſpondent of the Cabinet informs us, that Louiſiana is much incommoded by clouds of theſe Stares; which would ſhow that their manner of flying reſembles that of the European ſort.

                  <p>The ſhort account which Fernandez has given of this bird is not only incomplete, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly drawn up; for though he ſays that the Tolcana is, in ſize and figure, like the Stare, he afterwards adds that it is rather ſmaller. Yet he is the only original author from whom we can obtain information with regard to this bird, and on his evidence Briſſon has ranged it among the Stares. It appears to me, however, that theſe two authors adopt very different characters of the Stare: Briſſon, for inſtance, makes it the diſtinguiſhing feature of the genus, that the bill is ſtraight, blunt, and convex; and Fernandez, ſpeaking of a bird of the <hi>Tzanatl</hi> or <hi>Stare</hi> kind, mentions, that it is ſhort, thick, and rather hooked; and in another place he refers the ſame bird named <hi>Cacalotototl</hi> to the genus of the Raven (which is called <hi>Cacalotl</hi> in the Mexican

                        <p>This bird has, according to Fernandez, a black plumage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to blue, the bill entirely black, the iris orange, the tail long, the fleſh bad to eat, and no ſong.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1084500103:202"/>
its name bears in the Mexican language to that of the Stare; nor am I acquainted with any European bird to which I can refer it. Briſſon, who conceives it to be a <hi>Cottinga,</hi> has been obliged, in order to ſupport his preconceptions, to reject from the deſcription of Fernandez, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too ſhort, the words which indicate the lengthened and pointed ſhape of its bill; this ſhape being really related more cloſely to the Stare than to the Cottinga. Beſides, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtol is nearly of the bulk of the Stare; and, like that bird, it has a ſmall head, and is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent food; it likewiſe inhabits the temperate and warm regions. It is indeed a bad ſinger, but we have ſeen that the native notes of the European Stare are not very captivating; and, if it were carried into America, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that its imitation of the harſh muſic of the foreſt would ſoon deſtroy every harmonious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Sturnus Mexicanus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is ſky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blue, variegated with black.</q>

                  <p>I have given this laſt name to a bird, brought by M. Bougainville, on account of the white ray which, riſing on each ſide near the junction of the mandibles, bends under the eye and ſtretches along the neck. This white ray is the more remarkable, as it is environed by a deep brown; the dark colours prevail on the upper part of the body, only the wings and their coverts are edged with yellow. The tail is of a full black, forked, and extending not far beyond the wings, which are very long. The under ſide of the body, including the throat, is of a fine crimſon red, ſprinkled with black on the ſides; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior

part of the wing is alſo of crimſon, and not ſpotted; and the ſame colour appears round the eyes, and in the ſpace lying between theſe and the bill, which, though blunt as in the Stares, and leſs pointed than that of the Troupiales, may be regarded as neareſt the ſhape of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If we conſider alſo that the White Ray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles much the appearance of the Troupiales, we may eſteem it as intermediate between theſe two kinds<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Sturnus Milibaris:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is duſky, red below.</q>

               <p>THESE birds, as I have juſt obſerved, are nearly related to the European Stares, and often the vulgar and the naturaliſts have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them. We may regard them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Stares in the New World; their habits are the ſame, except in the mode of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their neſts.</p>
               <p>The American continent is the native region of theſe birds, and of all others that have been claſſed with them; ſuch as the Caſſics, the Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores, the Bonanas, &amp;c.; and though ſome are ſaid to belong to the Old World, theſe have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been brought from the New World; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, probably, the Troupiale of Senegal, called the <hi>Cape-More</hi>

               <p>I ſhall exclude from the genus of the Troupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ales, 1. The four ſpecies brought from Madras, and which Briſſon has borrowed from Ray; becauſe the <hi>law of climate</hi> will not admit the ſuppoſition, and the deſcriptions are not deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and the figures ſo ill executed, that they might as well be taken for magpies, jays, black-birds, loriots, and gobe-mouches, &amp;c.</p>

A ſkilful ornithologiſt (Mr. Edwards) is of opinion, that the yellow jay and the chop jay of Petiver, which Briſſon has made his ſixth and his fourth Troupiale, are only the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male loriot; and that the variegated jay of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras of the ſame Petiver, which is the fifth Troupiale of Briſſon, is his yellow Indian Stare; and laſtly, that the creſted Troupiale of Madras, which is Briſſon's ſeventh ſpecies, is the ſame bird with the creſted gobe-mouche of the Cape of Good Hope of the ſame Briſſon<note n="*" place="bottom">He adds, that the two long quills of the tail were wanting in theſe two individuals.

               <p n="2">2. I ſhall exclude the Bengal Troupiale, which is Briſſon's ninth ſpecies, ſince that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has himſelf perceived that it is his ſecond of the Stare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall exclude the Forked-tail Troupiale, which is the ſixth of Briſſon, and the Thruſh of Seba. All that the latter ſays is, that it is much larger than the thruſh; that its plumage is black, its bill yellow, the under ſurface of its tail white, the upper and its back ſhaded by a light tint of blue; that its tail is long, broad, and forked; and laſtly, that, excepting the difference in the ſhape of its tail, and in its bulk, it is much like the European thruſh. But in all this, I can perceive nothing that relates to a Troupiale; and the figure given by Seba, and which Briſſon rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1084500103:207"/>
a very bad one, no more reſembles a Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piale than it does a Thruſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall exclude the Blue Bonana of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras, becauſe, on the one hand, it is inconſiſtent with the law of the climate, and on the other, the figure and deſcription of Ray have nothing which would characteriſe the Bonana, not even the plumage. According to that author, its head, tail, and wings are blue, but the tail of a brighter tinge; the reſt of the plumage black or cinereous, except the bill and the feet, which are ruſty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, I ſhall exclude the India Troupiale, not only on account of the difference of climate, but for other ſtronger reaſons, which before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to place it between the Rollers and the Birds of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Though we have ranged along with the Troupiales, the Caſſies, the Baltimores, and the Bonanas, theſe, as they have received ſeparate names, are diſtinguiſhed by differences that are ſufficiently important to form ſmall ſubordinate <hi>genera.</hi> I am able, from the compariſon of a number of theſe birds, to aſſert that the Caſſies have the ſtrongeſt bill, next to them the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piales, and then the Bonanas. With reſpect to the Baltimores, their bill is not only ſmaller than in the reſt, but it is ſtraighter, and of a peculiar ſhape. They ſeem alſo to have different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts; I therefore retain their proper names, and treat of each ſeparately.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1084500103:208"/>
The common characters which Briſſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to them are the naked noſtrils, and the elongated conical form of the bill. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved that the upper mandible extends over the cranium, or that the tuft, inſtead of making a point, makes a conſiderable re-entrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle; a circumſtance which ſometimes occurs in other ſpecies, but is moſt remarkable in the preſent.</p>

               <p>The moſt obvious features in the exterior appearance of this bird are its long pointed bill, the narrow feathers of its neck, and the great variety of its plumage: not only three colours enter into it, an orange-yellow, black and white, but theſe colours ſeem to multiply by their artful diſtribution. The black is ſpread over the head, the anterior part of the neck, the

the orange-yellow occupies the intervals, and all the under part of the body;
it appears alſo in the iris

which prevails through the reſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by two oblong white ſpots,
of which the one is placed at the coverts of the wings, the other on their
middle quills.</p>
               <p>The feet and nails are ſometimes black, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a leaden colour. The bill ſeems to have no conſtant colour, for it has been obſerved to be in ſome white gray<note n="†" place="bottom">Briſſon.</note>, in others brown cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous above<note n="‡" place="bottom">Albin.</note>, and blue below; and laſtly, in others black above, and brown below<note n="§" place="bottom">Sloane and Marcgrave.</note>.</p>
               <p>This bird is nine or ten inches long from the point of the bill to the end of the tail; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Marcgrave, its wings extend fourteen inches, and its head is very ſmall. It is diſperſed through the region lying between Carolina and Brazil, and through the Caribbean iſlands. It is of the bulk of a blackbird; it hops like the magpie, and has many of its geſtures, according to Sloane. It has even, according to Marcgrave, the ſame cries; but Albin aſſerts that in all its actions it reſembles the Stare; and adds, that ſometimes four or five unite to attack a larger bird, which, after they have killed, they devour

orderly, each maintaining his rank. Sloane, an author worthy of credit, ſays, that the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piales live on inſects. Yet there is no abſolute contradiction; for every animal which feeds on the ſmalleſt reptile is rapacious, and would feed on larger animals if it could do it with ſafety.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds muſt be of a very ſocial diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince love, which divides ſo many other ſocieties, ſeems on the contrary to knit theirs more cloſely together. They do not ſeparate to accompliſh in retirement and ſecrecy the views of nature; a great many pairs are ſeen on the ſame tree, which is almoſt always lofty and ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, conſtructing their neſt, laying their eggs, hatching and cheriſhing their infant brood.</p>
               <p>Theſe neſts are of a cylindrical form, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended from the extremity of high branches, and waving freely in the air; ſo that the young are continually rocked. But ſome who believe that the birds act from deliberation, aſſert that the parents hang their neſt to avoid the attack of certain land animals, and eſpecially ſerpents.</p>
               <p>The Troupiale is alſo reckoned very docile, and eaſily ſubjected to domeſtic ſlavery; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity almoſt always attends a ſocial temper<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Oriolus Ictericus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Fulvous; the head, throat, back, the wing-quills, and coverts, black, with a white ſpot on the wings.</q>

               <p>Fernandez gives the name of <hi>Oziniſcan</hi> to two birds which bear no reſemblance; and Seba has taken the freedom to apply the ſame name to a third entirely different from either, except in ſize, which is that of the pigeon.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Oziniſcan</hi> is the Ring-tail <hi>(Arc-en-Queue)</hi> of this article. I give it this name on account of a black arch or creſcent with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavity turned towards the head, which appears diſtinctly on the tail when ſpread, and the more remarkable, as this is of a fine yellow colour, which is alſo that of the bill and of the whole body; the head and neck are black, and the wings of the ſame colour, with a ſlight tint of yellow.</p>
               <p>Seba adds, that he received many of theſe birds from America, where they are looked upon as ravenous. perhaps their habits are the ſame with thoſe of our Troupiales; the figure which Seba gives has a bill ſomewhat hooked near the point<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Oriolus Annulatus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Yellow; the head and neck black, the greater coverts of the wings and their quills edged with yellowiſh; the tail blackiſh and tinged.</q>

               <p>Briſſon makes the <hi>Xochitol</hi> of Fernandez the tenth ſpecies of his <hi>Troupiale of New Spain,</hi> and which the Spaniſh naturaliſt conſiders as only the adult <hi>Coſtotol.</hi> But he takes notice of two Coſtotols, which are pretty much alike; but if they differ in ſome degree, we muſt refer what Fernandez ſays here to the Coſtotol of Chap. xxviii.</p>
               <p>If we compare the deſcription of the Xochitol of Chap. cxxii. to that of Chap. xxviii. we ſhall meet with contradictions which it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to reconcile; for is it poſſible that the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totol, which when ſo much grown as to be able to ſing is only of the ſize of a Canary bird, ſhould afterwards acquire the bulk of a Stare? that when young it has the ſweet warble of the Goldfinch, but after it is adult, and received the name of the Xochitol, it ſhould have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable chatter of the Magpie? But wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences alſo occur in the plumage; in the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totol, the head and the under part of the body are yellow, while in the Xochitol they are black: in the former, the wings are yellow
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1084500103:217"/>
tipped with black; in the latter, they are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated with black and white above, and cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous below, without a ſingle yellow feather.</p>
               <p>But all theſe contradictions will vaniſh, if, inſtead of the Xochitol of Chap. cxxii. we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Xochitol or Flowery bird of Chap. cxxv. The ſize is nearly the ſame, being that of the Sparrow; its warble is pleaſant, like that of the Coſtotol, the yellow of which is mingled with other colours that variegate the plumage of the former: they are both an agreeable food. The Xochitol reſembles in two circumſtances the Troupiales; it lives upon inſects and ſeeds, and hangs its neſt from the ends of ſmall branches. The only difference which can be remarked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Xochitol of Chap. cxxv. and the Coſtotol, is, that the latter is found in warm countries only, while the former inhabits all cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates without diſtinction. But is it not likely that Xochitols go to breed in warm countries, where their young, or the Coſtotols, remain till they are grown up, or are Xochitols, and able to accompany their parents into colder climates? In the Coſtotol, the plumage is yellow, as I have ſaid, and the tips of the wings black; and in the Xochitol of Chap. cxxv. the plumage is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated with pale yellow, brown, white, and blackiſh.</p>
               <p>Briſſon has indeed made the latter his firſt <hi>carouge</hi>; but as it ſuſpends its neſt like the Troupiales, we have a deciſive reaſon to range
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1084500103:218"/>
it with theſe; except we reckon as another Troupiale the Xochitol of Chap. cxxii. of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez, which is of the ſize of a Stare; its breaſt, belly, and tail of a ſaffron colour, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egated with a little black; its wings variegated with black and white below and cinereous above; its head, and the reſt of its body, black; it has the chatter of the Magpie, and its fleſh is good eating.</p>

               <p>This is the true Acolchi of Fernandez. It is called the Commander<note n="†" place="bottom">In Spaniſh, <hi>Commendadoza.</hi>
                  </note>, on account of a fine red mark on the anterior part of its wings, which in ſome meaſure reſembles the badge of the order of knighthood. The effect is here the more ſtriking, as it is thrown upon a ground of ſhining gloſſy black; for that is the general colour not only of its plumage, but of its bill, feet, and nails. There are, however, ſome ſlight exceptions; the iris is white, and the baſe of the bill is encircled by a narrow ring of red; the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1084500103:220"/>
bill alſo inclines ſometimes to brown rather than black, according to Albin. But the real colour of the mark on the wings is not a pure red, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Fernandez, but is tarniſhed with a rufous tint, which increaſes and becomes at laſt the predominant colour. Theſe ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, the red occupying the anterior and the more elevated part of the ſpot; yellow, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior and lower. But is this true with regard to all the individuals, or has not that been aſcribed to the whole ſpecies which is applicable only to the females? We are certain that in theſe the ſpot on the wings is not of ſo bright a red; beſides that diſtinction, the black of their plumage is mixed with gray, and they are ſmaller.</p>
               <p>The Red-Wing is nearly of the ſize and ſhape of the Stare; its extreme length is eight or nine inches, and its alar extent thirteen or fourteen; it weighs three ounces and a half.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds inhabit the cold as well as the warm countries: They are found in Virginia, Carolina, Louiſiana, Mexico, &amp;c. They are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the New World, though one was killed in the environs of London; but this had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eſcaped from its cage. They can be eaſily tamed, and taught to ſpeak; and they are fond of ſinging and playing, whether they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, or allowed to run through the houſe; for they are very familiar and lively.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:1084500103:221"/>
The one killed near London was opened; in its ſtomach were found caterpillars, beetles, and maggots. But in America they feed on wheat, maize, &amp;c. and are very deſtructive. They fly in numerous flocks, and, like the Stares of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, joining other birds equally deſtructive, as the Jamaica Magpies, they pour their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed ſquadrons on the ſtanding crops and ſown fields; but the havock which they commit is by far greateſt in the warm regions, and near the ſea-coaſt.</p>
               <p>When the planters fire on theſe combined flocks, birds fall of different kinds, and before the piece can be again charged, another flight arrives.</p>
               <p>Cateſby informs us, that in Carolina and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia they always breed among the ruſhes; they interweave the points of theſe ſo as to form a ſort of roof or ſhed, under which they build their neſt, and at ſo proper a height that it can never be reached by the higheſt floods. This conſtruction is very different from that of our firſt Troupiale, and ſhews a different inſtinct, and therefore proves that it is a diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Fernandez pretends that they neſtle on the trees near the plantations: Has this ſpecies dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cuſtoms accommodated to the different countries where it is found?</p>
               <p>The Red-Wings appear in Louiſiana in the winter only, but they are then ſo numerous that three hundred have been ſometimes caught in a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1084500103:222"/>
ſingle draw of the net. For this purpoſe is uſed a long and very narrow net of ſilk, in two parts, like that for larks. <q rend="inline">When they intend to ſpread it,</q> ſays Le Page Dupratz, <q rend="inline">they clear a place near the wood, and make a kind of path, which is ſmooth and beaten, on which they ſtrew a train of rice or other grain, and retire to conceal themſelves behind a buſh where the drag-cord is brought. When the flocks of Red-Wings paſs over the ſpot, they quickly deſcry the bait, light, and are caught in an inſtant. It is neceſſary to diſpatch them, it being impoſſible to collect ſo many alive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But they are deſtroyed chiefly as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious birds, for though they ſometimes grow very fat, their fleſh is always indifferent eating; another point of reſemblance to the Stares of Europe.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen at Abbé Aubri's a variety of this ſpecies, in which the head and the upper part of the neck was of a light fulvous colour. The reſt of its plumage was the ſame as uſual. This firſt variety ſeems to ſhew that the bird repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the <hi>Planches Enluminées,</hi> No. 343, by the name of <hi>Cayenne Carouge,</hi> is a ſecond, which differs from the firſt in wanting the red ſpots on the wings only; for the reſt of its plumage is exactly the ſame; the ſize is nearly alike, and the ſame proportions take place; and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the climates is not ſo great, but
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1084500103:223"/>
that we may ſuppoſe a bird could be equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to both.</p>
               <p>We need only compare No. 402, and Fig. 2, No. 236, of the <hi>Planches Enluminées,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the bird engraved in the latter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Cayenne Troupiale,</hi> is only a ſecond variety of the ſpecies of No. 402, under the name of <hi>Red-winged Troupiales of Louiſiana,</hi> which is the ſubject of the preſent article. It is nearly the ſame in ſize, ſhape, and in the kind and diſtribution of the colours; except that in No. 236, the red tinges not only the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part of the wings, but is ſpread over the throat, the origin of the neck, a portion of the belly, and even the iris.</p>
               <p>If we next compare this bird, No. 236, with the one repreſented, No. 536, under the name of <hi>Guiana Troupiale,</hi> we ſhall perceive that the latter is a variety of the former, ariſing from the difference of age or ſex. All the colours are fainter; the red feathers are edged with white, and the black or blackiſh with light gray; ſo that the figure of each feather is diſtinctly marked, and the bird looks as if it were covered with ſcales. But the diſtribution of the colours is the ſame, the bulk the ſame, the climate the ſame, &amp;c. It is impoſſible to diſcover ſo many relations ſubſiſting between birds of different ſpecies.</p>

               <p>The ſpots which occur in this ſmall Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piale are owing to this circumſtance, that almoſt all the feathers, which are brown or blackiſh in the middle, are edged with yellow, more or leſs inclined to orange on the wings, the tail, and the lower part of the body. The throat is of a pure white; a ſtreak of the ſame colour which paſſes cloſe under the eye ſtretches back between two parallel black ſtreaks, one of which accompanies the white above, and the other bends round the eye below; the iris is of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1084500103:228"/>
a bright orange, almoſt red:—All theſe give a lively appearance to the male; for though the iris is orange alſo in the female, its plumage is of a tarniſhed yellow, which, mingling with a pale white, produces an unpleaſant uniformity.</p>
               <p>The bill is thick and pointed, as in the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piales, and cinereous; the legs are fleſh-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Its proportion may be conceived from the figure.</p>

But this colour is not uniform; it is darker on the neck, the back, and the adjacent coverts of the wings, and ſomewhat leſs ſo on the tail; it is much lighter under the tail, and alſo on a great part of the coverts of the wings, which are furtheſt from the back; with this difference between the large and the ſmall ſort, that the latter have no mixture of colour, while the former are variegated with brown. The head, the throat, the fore-part of the neck and the breaſt, are of a gloſſy brown, deeper under the throat, and inclining to orange on the breaſt, and running into the olive colour of the lower part of the body. The bill and legs are black; the wing-quills, and the large coverts neareſt the outer edge, are of the ſame colour, but bordered with white.</p>

               <p>The two birds figured No. 375 and 376, <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> were brought by the captain of a ſhip who had collected forty birds from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, Senegal, Madagaſcar, &amp;c. and who had called them Senegal Chaffinches. They have been termed Senegal Troupiales; but that appellation ſeems very improper; for the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is different from that of the Troupiales, and the Weaver is widely diſtinguiſhed by the proportions of its bill, tail, and wings, and the manner in which it builds its neſt. It is perhaps the African repreſentative of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſpecies. The two which we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned belonged to a lady of high rank, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1084500103:231"/>
them to be deſigned at her houſe, and has obligingly communicated ſome particulars that occurred with regard to the way in which they conducted themſelves. This is the only ſource of information which we have.</p>
               <p>The eldeſt had a kind of cowl which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a brown-gold gloſs in the ſun; this cowl diſappeared in the moulting during the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, leaving the head of a yellow colour; but it again returned in the ſpring, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly renewed the ſucceeding years. The chief colour of the reſt of the body was yellow, more or leſs inclined to orange; this was the predominant colour on the back, and on the lower part of the body; it bordered the coverts of the wings, their quills, and thoſe of the tail, which were all of a blackiſh ground.</p>
               <p>The young one had no cowl till the end of the ſecond year, and did not even change its colours before that time; which occaſioned its being miſtaken for a female, and deſigned as ſuch, No. 376. This miſtake was excuſable, ſince the diſtinction of ſexes is not apparent during infancy, and one of the principal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the females is that of preſerving long the marks of youth.</p>
               <p>Before the change which took place in the colours of its plumage, the yellow was of a lighter tint than in the old one; it ſpread over the throat, the neck, the breaſt, and bordered, as in the other, all the quills of the tail and of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1084500103:232"/>
the wings. The back was of an olive-brown, which extended beyond the neck as far as the head. In both the iris was orange, the bill of a horn colour, thicker and ſhorter than in the Troupiale, and the legs reddiſh.</p>
               <p>Theſe two birds lived in the ſame cage, and at firſt upon good terms with each other; the young one ſat generally on the higheſt bar, holding its bill cloſe to the other, which it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, by clapping its wings, and with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive air.</p>
               <p>They were obſerved in the ſpring to inter-weave chickweed in the grating of their cage; this was therefore conceived as an indication of their deſire to neſtle. They were ſupplied with ſmall ruſhes, and they built a neſt ſo capacious as to conceal one of them entirely. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing year they renewed their labour; but the young one being new clothed in the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of its ſex, was driven off by the other, and obliged to conduct its work alone in another corner of the cage. But it was ſtill perſecuted, and notwithſtanding its ſubmiſſive behaviour, it was often ſo roughly treated as to be left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. They were ſeparated, and each was intent on building; but the labours of one day were often deſtroyed in the ſucceeding—A neſt is not the production of an individual.</p>
               <p>They had both a ſingular kind of ſong, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhrill, but very ſprightly. The old one died ſuddenly, and the young one was cut off
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1084500103:233"/>

               <p>I ſee no reaſon why Briſſon has reckoned this bird a Baltimore, for both in the ſhape of its bill and in the proportions of its tarſus it ſeems more related to the Troupiales. But I leave the matter undecided, placing it between the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piales and Baltimores, and applying the vulgar name which it receives in St. Domingo, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its ſhrill notes.</p>
               <p>This bird is in general brown above, except the rump and the ſmall coverts of the wings, which are of a greeniſh yellow, as alſo in the whole under-part of the body; but this colour is duſky below the throat, and variegated with ruſty on the neck and breaſt; the great coverts and the quills of the wings, as well as the twelve of the tail, are edged with yellow. But to form
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1084500103:234"/>
an accurate idea of the plumage of the Whiſtler, we muſt imagine an olive tint of various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſity ſpread over all the colours without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. To characterize the predominant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the plumage of this bird, therefore, we ought to take olive and not green, as Briſſon has done.</p>

               <p>This bird owes its name to ſome reſemblance that is perceived between the nature and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the colours of its plumage, and the arms of Lord Baltimore<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Baltimore was a Roman Catholic nobleman, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the grant of Maryland, which he planted. T.</note>. It is a ſmall bird of the ſize of a houſe Sparrow, and weighing little more than an ounce; its length is ſix or ſeven inches, its alar extent eleven or twelve, its tail compoſed of twelve quills, and two or three
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1084500103:235"/>
inches long, ſtretching more than a half beyond the wings when cloſed. A ſort of cowl of a fine black covers the head, and deſcends before upon the throat, and behind as far as the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: the great coverts and the quills of the wings are alſo black, like thoſe of the tail; but the former are edged with white, and the latter tipped with orange, which is the broader the farther they are from the mid-ones, in which it is wanting. The reſt of the plumage is of a beautiful orange; and laſtly, the bill and legs are of a lead colour.</p>
               <p>In the female, which I examined in the Royal Cabinet, all the fore-part was of a fine black, as in the male, the tail of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the great coverts and the wing-quills black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, the whole without any mixture of other colour; and what was ſo beautiful an orange in the male, was only a dirty red in the female.</p>
               <p>I have already ſaid, that the bill of the Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores was not only proportionably ſhorter and ſtraighter than in the Carouges, the Troupiales, and the Caſſiques, but of a peculiar ſhape: It is a pyramid of five ſides, two belonging to the upper mandible, and three to the lower. I ſhall add, that its leg, or rather its tarſus, is more ſlender than in the Carouges and Troupiales.</p>
               <p>The Baltimores diſappear in the winter, at leaſt in Virginia and Maryland, where Cateſby obſerved them. They are alſo found in Canada, but Cateſby met with none in Carolina.</p>

               <p>This bird was no doubt ſo called becauſe the colours of its plumage are not ſo lively as in the Baltimore, and for this reaſon it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a degraded race. In fact, when we compare theſe birds, and find an exact corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence in every thing, except in the colours, and not even in the diſtribution of theſe, but only in the different tints which they aſſume;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1084500103:237"/>
we cannot heſitate to infer that the Baſtard Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore is a variety of a more generous race, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the influence of climate, or ſome other accidental cauſe. The black on the head is ſomewhat mottled, that of the throat pure; that part of the hood which falls behind is of an olive gray, which becomes darker as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the back. Whatever in the preceding was bright orange, is in the preſent yellow, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on orange, and more vivid on the breaſt and the coverts of the tail than on any other place. The wings are brown, but their great coverts and their quills are of a dirty white. Of the twelve tail quills, the two central ones are blackiſh near their middle, olive at their origin, and yellow at their extremity; the next one on either ſide ſhews the two firſt colours mixed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly; and in the four following quills, the two laſt colours are melted together. In a word, the true Baltimore bears the ſame relation to the baſtard one in reſpect to the colours of the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that the latter bears to its female; in which the upper-part of the body is of a duſky white, and the under of a yellowiſh white. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Oriolus Spurius:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is black, fulvous below, with a white ſtripe on the wings.</q> In the State of New-York it uſually arrives in May; attaches its neſt to an apple-tree, and lays five eggs.</note>

               <p>When we compare the Caſſiques with the Troupiales, the Carouges, and the Baltimores, all which have many common properties, we perceive that they are larger, that their bill is ſtronger, and their legs proportionably ſhorter; not to mention the difference in the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance which it would be difficult to deſcribe.</p>
               <p>Several authors have given figures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the Yellow Caſſique under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent names, and ſcarcely two of theſe exactly correſpond.—But before we proceed to conſider the varieties in detail, it will be proper to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a bird, the characters of which ſeem to be widely diſtant from thoſe of the Yellow Caſſique of Brazil: It is the Perſian Magpie of Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus. That naturaliſt deſcribes it merely from a drawing, which had been ſent from Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice. He reckons it to be of the ſize of our Magpie. Its predominant colour is not black,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1084500103:239"/>
but only duſkiſh <hi>(ſubfuſcum):</hi> Its bill is very thick, ſomewhat ſhort <hi>(breviuſculum)</hi> and whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; its eyes white, and its nails ſmall; whereas the Yapou is ſcarcely larger than a Blackbird, and the dark part of its plumage is jet black; its bill is pretty long, of the colour of ſulphur; its iris is like ſapphire, and its nails of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrength, according to Edwards, and even very ſtrong and hooked, according to Belon. We cannot doubt that birds ſo diſtinct belong to different ſpecies; eſpecially if Aldrovandus's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation be true, that his bird is a native of Perſia, for we are certain that the Yapou is American.</p>
               <p>The principal colours of the Yapou are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly black and yellow, but the diſtribution is not uniformly the ſame, and varies in different individuals.—The one, for inſtance, which we have cauſed to be deſigned is entirely black, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the bill and the iris, as we have ſaid, and the great coverts of the wings neareſt the body, which are yellow, as alſo all the hind-part of the body, both above and below, from the thighs incluſively as far as the middle of the tail, and even beyond it.—In another, which was brought from Cayenne and lodged in the Royal Cabinet, and which is larger than the preceding, there is leſs yellow on the wings, and none at all on the lower part of the thigh, and the legs appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ſtronger:—it is probably a male.—In the Black and White Pye of Edwards, which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1084500103:240"/>
is evidently the ſame bird with ours, there is on four or five of the yellow coverts of the wings a black ſpot near their extremity; and beſides this, the black has purple reflexions, and the bird is rather larger.—In the Yapou or Jupujuba of Marcgrave, the tail is mottled with black and white only below, for its upper ſurface is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely black, except the outmoſt feather on each ſide, which is yellow half its length.</p>
               <p>It follows, therefore, that the colours of the plumage are by no means fixed and invariable in this ſpecies, which inclines me to believe with Marcgrave<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſaw ſome entirely black, having the back of a blood colour. <bibl>MARCGRAVE.</bibl>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1084500103:241"/>
Red Caſſique of Briſſon, becauſe it reſembles that bird in the eſſential points; the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, the ſame ſize, the ſame aſpect, the ſame bill, the ſame legs, and the ſame deep black diffuſed through moſt of its plumage. It is true, that the lower part of the back is red, inſtead of yellow, and the under ſurface of the body and of the tail entirely black; but this cannot be conſidered as a material diſtinction in a bird whoſe plumage, we have already obſerved, is ſubject to conſiderable variations. Beſides, yellow and red are contiguous colours, and apt to melt into orange; a circumſtance which may be occaſioned by difference of age, of ſex, of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or of ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Theſe birds are about twelve inches long, and ſeventeen acroſs the wings; the tail is forked and bluiſh; the two mandibles are equally arched downwards; the firſt <hi>phalanx</hi> of the outer toe in each foot ſeems to grow into the mid-toe; the tail conſiſts of twelve quills, and the under ſurface is white both below the black and the yellow part of the plumáge.</p>
                     <p>They conſtruct their neſts with graſs, inter-woven with horſe hair and hogs briſtles, or with vegetable productions which ſupply their place, and they imitate the form of a cucurbit fitted to its alembic. The neſts are brown on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and about eighteen inches deep, though the interior cavity is only a foot; the upper part is thick and prominent for the ſpace of half a foot; and here they are ſuſpended from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of ſmall branches. Sometimes four hundred of theſe neſts have been ſeen at once hanging in a ſingle tree, of the kind which the Brazilians call <hi>Uti</hi>; and as the Yapous hatch thrice a-year, the multiplication muſt be prodigious.

A velvet black on the back, the feathers of the tail, thoſe of the wings, and their great coverts, and even on the bill and the legs. 3. Deep orange on the ſmall coverts of the wings, the rump, and the coverts of the tail. All theſe colours are more obſcure in the female.</p>
               <p>The length of the Bonana is ſeven inches, that of its bill ſix lines, that of its tail above three inches; its wings when ſpread meaſure eleven inches, and when cloſed extend to the middle of the tail, or beyond it. This bird was brought from Martinico; that of Cayenne
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1084500103:246"/>
(Fig. 1. No. 607, <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi>) is ſmaller, and the ſort of cowl which covers its head, neck, &amp;c. is black, ſprinkled with ſome ſmall white ſpots on the ſides of the neck, and little reddiſh ſtreaks on the back; and laſtly, the great coverts and the middle feathers of the wings are edged with white. But theſe differences are, I conceive, too inconſiderable to prevent our ſuppoſing the Cayenne Bonana a variety of that of Martinico. They conſtruct a curious kind of neſt, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the quarter of a hollow globe; and few it under the leaf of a Bonana, which ſhelters the neſt, and forms a part of it; the reſt conſiſts of the fibres of the leaves.</p>
               <p>In what has been ſaid, it would be difficult to recogniſe the Spaniſh Nightingale of Sloane<note n="*" place="bottom">Called alſo the <hi>Watchy Picket</hi> and <hi>American Hang-neſt.</hi> It is the <hi>Oriolus Nidipendulus</hi> of Gmelin, and the <hi>Hang-neſt Oriole</hi> of Latham.</note>; for that bird is in every reſpect ſmaller than the Bonana, being only ſix Engliſh inches in length, and nine acroſs the wings; its plumage is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and it conſtructs its neſt in another mode. It is a ſort of bag, ſuſpended from the extremity of ſmall branches by a thread which they ſpin out of a ſubſtance that they extract from a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſite plant, called <hi>old man's beard,</hi> which many have miſtaken for horſe-hair. In Sloane's bird the baſe of the bill was whitiſh, and encircled by a black ring; the crown of the head, the neck, the back, and the tail, were of a light
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1084500103:247"/>
brown, or rather reddiſh gray; the wings of a deeper brown, variegated with ſome white fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the lower part of the tail marked in its middle with a black line; the ſides of the neck, the breaſt, and the belly, of the colour of a dead leaf.</p>
               <p>Sloane mentions a variety, either from age or ſex, which differs from the preceding, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its back has more of the yellow tint, the breaſt and belly of a brighter yellow, and there is a greater ſhare of black under the bill.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds haunt the woods, and have an agreeable ſong. They feed on inſects and worms, for fragments of theſe are found in their gizzard or ſtomach, which is not muſcular. Their liver is divided into a great number of lobes, and of a blackiſh colour.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen a variety of the St. Domingo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouges, or the Yellow Bottoms of Cayenne, which I proceed to conſider: it reſembled much the female Bonana of Martinico, except that its head and neck were blacker. This confirms my idea, that moſt of theſe ſpecies are related, and that notwithſtanding our conſtant endeavour to reduce their number, we have ſtill carried the ſubdiviſions too far; eſpecially with regard to foreign birds, with which we are ſo imperfectly acquainted<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Oriolus Bonana:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is fulvous, its head and breaſt cheſnut, its back and the quills of its wings and tail, black.</q>

               <p>This bird is repreſented <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> No. 607, Fig. 2, under the name of the Carouge (Bonana) of the Cape of Good Hope. I had long ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that this bird, though brought from the Cape to Europe, was really not a native of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; and the point is decided by the late arrival (October 1773) of a Bonana from Louiſiana, which is evidently of the ſame ſpecies, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in nothing but in the colour of the throat, which in the latter is black, and orange in the former. I am convinced that we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the ſame opinion of all the pretended Bonanas and Troupiales of the ancient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and that we ſhall diſcover ſooner or later that they are either of a different ſpecies, or have derived their origin from America.</p>

The Olive Bonana of Louiſiana has much of the olive tinge in its plumage, eſpecially on the upper part of the body; but this colour is not uniform; it is tinctured with gray on the crown of the head, and with brown behind the neck, on the back, the ſhoulders, the wings, and the tail; with a light-brown on the rump and the origin of the tail; and with yellow on the flanks and the thighs, and the large coverts and quills of the wings, whoſe fundamental colour is brown, are edged with yellow. All the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-part of the body is yellow, except the throat, which is orange; the bill and the legs are of a cinereous brown.</p>
               <p>This bird is nearly of the ſize of a houſe ſparrow; its length ſix or ſeven inches, its alar extent ten or eleven inches. The bill is near an inch long, and the tail more than two; it is ſquare, and conſiſts of twelve quills.

               <p>This new ſpecies, brought very lately from China, appears to reſemble ſo much the Bonana on the one hand, and the Blackbird on the other, that it may be regarded as the intermediate ſhade. The ſides of its bill are compreſſed as in the Blackbird, but not ſcalloped like thoſe of the Bonana; and Daubenton the younger has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly given it a diſtinct name, as being really different from theſe two ſpecies, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects the common chain.</p>
               <p>The Kink is ſmaller than our Blackbird: its head, its neck, origin of its back, and its breaſt, are of aſh-gray, and this colour acquires a deeper hue as it approaches the back; the reſt of the body, both above and below, is white, as alſo the coverts of the wings, whoſe quills are of a poliſhed ſteel-colour, gliſtening with reflexions that play between greeniſh and violet. The tail is ſhort, tapered, and parted by this ſame ſteel colour and white; ſo that on the two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quills, the white is only a ſmall ſpot at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; this white ſpot extends higher on the following quills, the farther they remove from the middle, and the ſteel colour retiring, is at laſt reduced on the two exterior quills to a ſmall ſpot near their origin.</p>

retaining thoſe which really belong to it, and referring the others to thoſe kinds which the ancients intended them to denote. I ſhall here obſerve only that, though this bird is diſperſed through a wide extent, there are certain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which it ſeems to avoid. It is not found in Sweden, in England, in the Bugey mountains, nor in the heights of Nantua, though it appears in Switzerland regularly twice a year. Belon ſays that he never ſaw it in Greece; and how can we ſuppoſe that Ariſtotle knew this bird, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being acquainted with the ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of its neſt, or if he knew it, that he ſhould have omitted to take notice of it?</p>

The Loriot is a roving bird, continually changing its abode; it lives with us only dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeaſon of love. It obeys the primary impulſes with ardour and fidelity. The union is formed on the arrival, about the middle of the ſpring. The pair build their neſt on lofty trees, but often at no conſiderable height; they form it with ſingular induſtry, and in a way very different from that of the Blackbird, though they have been referred to the ſame genus. They commonly faſten to the fork of a ſmall branch long ſtraws or hemp-ſtalks; ſome of which, extending directly acroſs, form the margin of the neſt; others penetrate through its texture; while others, bending under it, give ſolidity to the ſtructure. The neſt is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with an exterior cover, and the inner bed, prepared for receiving the eggs, is a matting of the ſmall ſtems of dog-graſs, the beards of which are ſo much concealed that the neſt has often been ſuppoſed to be lined with the roots of plants. The interſtices between the outer and inner caſe are filled with moſs, lichens, and other ſuch ſubſtances, which compact the whole. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the neſt is conſtructed, the female drops in it four or five eggs, the ground colour of which is a dirty white, and ſprinkled with ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1084500103:258"/>
ſpots of a brown, approaching to black, moſt numerous on the ſmall end. She ſits cloſely three weeks, and not only retains long her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note n="*" place="bottom">BELON.</note> to her young, but defends them againſt their enemies, and even againſt man, with more intrepidity than could be expected from ſo ſmall a bird. The parents have been ſeen to dart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely upon the plunderers of their brood; and what is ſtill more remarkable, a mother, taken with her neſt, continued to hatch in the cage, and expired on her eggs.</p>
               <p>After the young are reared, the family pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for its journey. This commonly happens in the end of Auguſt, or the beginning of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. They never aſſemble in numerous flocks, nor do the families remain united, for ſeldom are more than two or three found toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Though they fly rather heavily, flapping their wings like the Blackbird, they probably win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Africa: for on the one hand, the Chevalier des Mazy, Commander of the Order of Malta, aſſures me, that they paſs that iſland in the month of September, and repaſs it in the ſpring; and on the other, Thevenot ſays, that they migrate into Egypt in the month of May, and return in September<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Voyage du Levant, tom. i. p. 493.</bibl>
                  </note>. He adds, that in May they are very fat, and their fleſh good eating. Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus is ſurpriſed that in France they are never brought to our tables.</p>

The Loriot is about as large as the Blackbird; its length nine or ten inches, its alar extent ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, its tail three and a half long, and its bill fourteen lines. The male is of a fine yellow over all the body, the neck, and head, except a black ſtreak which ſtretches from the eye to the corner of the aperture of the bill. The wings are black, except a few yellow ſpots, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate moſt of the great quills, and ſome of the coverts: the tail is divided by yellow and black, ſo that the black prevails on the part which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of the two mid-quills, and the yellow gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually exends over the lateral quills, beginning at the tips of thoſe which are next the two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ones. But the plumage is very different in the two ſexes. Almoſt all that was of a pure black in the male, is, in the female, of a brown, with a greeniſh tinge; and what was of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful yellow in the former, is in the latter olive and pale brown:—olive on the head, and the upper part of the body dirty white, variegated with brown ſtreaks under the body, white at the tips of moſt of the wing-quills, and pale yellow at the extremity of their coverts; and there is no pure yellow, except at the end of the tail and on the lower coverts. I have beſides obſerved in a female, a ſmall ſpace behind the ear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feathers, and of a light ſlate colour.</p>
               <p>The young males reſemble the females with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to plumage, and the more ſo the tenderer their age. At firſt they are ſtill more ſpeckled
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1084500103:260"/>
than the female, and even on the upper part of the body; but in the month of Auguſt the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low begins to appear under the body. Their cry is different alſo from that of the old ones; they ſcream <hi>yo, yo, yo,</hi> ſucceeded ſometimes with a ſort of mewing like that of a cat<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner ſays, that they pronounce <hi>Oriot,</hi> or <hi>Loriot</hi>; Belon, that they ſeem to ſay <hi>compere loriot</hi>; and others have fancied that they articulated <hi>louſot bonnes meriſes,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. But they have alſo a ſort of whiſtling, eſpecially before rain<note n="†" place="bottom">GESNER.</note>; if this be not really the ſame with the mewing.</p>
               <p>Their iris is red, the bill reddiſh brown, the inſide of the bill reddiſh, the edges of the lower mandible ſomewhat arched lengthwiſe, the tongue forked, and, as it were, jagged at the tip, the gizzard muſcular, terminating in a bag formed by the dilatation of the <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> the gall bladder green, the <hi>coeca</hi> very ſmall and ſhort, and the firſt <hi>phalanx</hi> of the outer toe glued to that of the middle toe.</p>
               <p>When they arrive in the ſpring, they feed on caterpillars, worms, inſects, whatever in ſhort they can catch; but they are fondeſt of cherries, figs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hence they have been called <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>Becafigos.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the figs improve the quality of their fleſh; they do ſo in the caſe of Blackbirds.</note>, the berries of the ſervice tree, peas, &amp;c.

the cherries one after another, and only eat the ripe part.</p>
               <p>The Loriots are not eaſy to breed or tame. They can be caught by the call, placing limed twigs where they drink, and by various ſorts of nets.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds have ſometimes ſpread from one end of the continent to another, without ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any alteration in their external form, or in their plumage; for Loriots have been ſeen in Bengal, and even in China, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely like ours. But others have been brought from nearly the ſame countries, which had ſome differences in their colours, and which may be regarded, for the moſt part, as varieties of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, till accurate obſervations, of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, their habits, and manner of life, throw light on our conjectures<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Golden Oriole:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is yellow, its ſtraps and joints are black, its outer tail-quills yellow behind.</q> It ſeldom or never viſits England.</note>.</p>

               <p>The fourth ſpecies is the <hi>Red-Wing,</hi> Pl. Enl. No. 51, which is the <hi>turdus iliacus</hi> of the ancients.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall ſubjoin ſome foreign Thruſhes, which are too little known to be referred to their proper ſpecies: ſuch are the <hi>Green Barbary Thruſh</hi> of Doctor Shaw, and the <hi>Chineſe Hoami</hi> of Briſſon, which I ſhall admit into the Thruſhes, upon the authority of that naturaliſt, though it appears to me to differ from them in its plumage and in its ſhape.</p>
               <p>Of the four principal ſpecies belonging to our climate, the two firſt, which are the Throſtle
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1084500103:268"/>
and the Miſſel, reſemble each other. Both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be leſs ſubject to the neceſſity of migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince they often breed in France, Germany, Italy, and in ſhort in thoſe countries where they paſs the winter. Both ſing delightfully, and they are of the ſmall number of birds whoſe warble is compoſed of a ſucceſſion of notes; and they both ſeem to be of an unſocial diſpoſition, for, according to ſome obſervers, they perform their journies alone. Friſch traces other ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies alſo between the colours of their plumage, and the order of their diſtribution, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The two other ſpecies, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fieldfare and the Red-wing, are alſo analogous in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. They travel in numerous flocks, are more tranſitory, and ſeldom neſtle in our climates; for which reaſon they ſing very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note n="*" place="bottom">FRISCH.—<q rend="inline">In ſummer (ſays TURNER), the Turdus Pilaris is ſeldom or never ſeen with us (in England); in winter no birds are more numerous.</q>

               <p>Their fleſh is a delicate food, eſpecially that of the firſt and fourth ſpecies, which are the Throſtle and the Red-Wing: but the ancient Romans held it in ſtill higher eſtimation than we, and kept theſe birds the whole year in a ſort of voleries, which deſerve to be deſcribed<note n="*" place="bottom">

Theſe Thruſhes had leſs liberty in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries than our field pigeons in their dovecotes; for they were never ſuffered to go abroad, and they laid no eggs: but as they were ſupplied with abundance of choice food, they fattened to the great profit of the proprietor<note n="*" place="bottom">Each fat Thruſh, except at the time of migration, ſold for three <hi>denarii,</hi> equal to about two ſhillings ſterling.

                  </note>. The vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries were a kind of vaulted courts, the inſide furniſhed with a number of rooſts. The door was very low, the windows were few, and placed in ſuch manner as to prevent the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from ſeeing the fields, the woods, the birds fluttering at liberty, or whatever might awaken their ſenſibility, and diſturb the calm ſo conducive to corpulence. A little glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſufficient to direct them to their food; which conſiſted of millet, and a ſort of paſte made with bruiſed figs and flour. They had alſo given them the berries of the lentiſk, of the myrtle, of the ivy, and whatever in ſhort would improve the delicacy and flavour of their fleſh. They were ſupplied with a little ſtream of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ran in a gutter through the volery. Twenty days before they were intended for killing, their allowance was augmented; nay ſo far was the attention carried, that they gently removed into a little anti-chamber the Thruſhes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1084500103:271"/>
which were plump and in good order, to enjoy more quiet; and frequently to heighten the illuſion, they hung boughs and verdure imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural ſeenery; ſo that the birds might fancy themſelves in the midſt of the woods. In ſhort, they treated their ſlaves well, becauſe they knew their intereſt. Such as were newly caught, were put in ſmall ſeparate voleries along with others that had been accuſtomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; and every contrivance, every ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing art, was employed to habituate them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to bondage; yet theſe were birds never completely tamed.</p>
               <p>We can at preſent perceive ſome traces of the ancient practice, improved indeed by the ſkill of the moderns. It is common in certain provinces of France to hang pots in the tops of trees which are haunted by the Thruſhes; and theſe birds finding convenient ſheltered neſts, ſeldom fail to lay their eggs in them to hatch and rear their young<note n="*" place="bottom">BELON.</note>. This plan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes doubly to the multiplication of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; for it both preſerves the brood, and by ſaving the time ſpent in building neſts, it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them to make two hatches in the year<note n="†" place="bottom">It appears even that they ſometimes have three hatches; for Salerne found in the month of September a Thruſh's neſt in a vine containing three eggs not yet hatched, which appeared to be of the third hatch.</note>. When they find no pots, they conſtruct their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1084500103:272"/>
neſts in trees or even buſhes, and with great art; they cover the outſide with moſs, ſtraw, dried leaves, &amp;c. but they line the inſide with a hard caſe formed of mud, compacted with ſtraws and ſmall roots. In this reſpect they differ from the Pies and Blackbirds, which lay their eggs on a ſoft mattreſs. Theſe neſts are hollow hemiſpheres about four inches in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. The colour of the eggs varies in the different ſpecies between blue and green, with ſome dull ſpots that are moſt frequent on the large end. Every ſpecies has alſo its peculiar ſong; and ſometimes they have even been taught to ſpeak<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">Agrippina, the wife of Claudius Caeſar, had a Thruſh which imitated human ſpeech.</q>

                  </note>. But this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood chiefly of the Throſtle and the Miſſel, in which the organs of voice ſeem to be the moſt perfect.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that the Thruſhes ſwallow the ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries entire of the juniper, the miſletoe, the ivy, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">Linnaeus.</note>, and void them ſo little altered, that when they fall in a proper ſoil, they germi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and produce. But Aldrovandus affirms that, having made theſe birds ſwallow the grapes of the wild vine and the berries of the miſletoe, he could never diſcover in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements any of theſe that retained its form.</p>
               <p>The Thruſhes have a ventricle more or leſs muſcular, no craw, nor even a dilatation of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1084500103:273"/>
                  <hi>oeſophagus</hi> which may ſupply its place, and ſcarce any <hi>caecum</hi>; but all of them have a gall bladder, have the end of the tongue parted into two or three threads, and have eighteen quills in each wing, and twelve in the tail.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are ſad and melancholy, and as the natural conſequence of that diſpoſition, they are the more enamoured of liberty. They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom play or even fight together; ſtill leſs will they bend to domeſtic ſlavery. But their love of freedom is not equalled by their reſources for preſervation. Their oblique and tortuous flight is almoſt their only protection againſt the ſhot of the ſportſman, or the talons of the bird of prey<note n="*" place="bottom">Skilful ſportſmen aſſure me that Thruſhes are difficult to ſhoot, even more ſo than Snipes.</note>.

Thouſands of them are caught in ſnares; but the Throſtle and the Red-Wing are the two ſpecies which can the moſt eaſily be caught by the nooſe, and almoſt the only ones that can be taken by the call.</p>
               <p>Theſe nooſes are nothing but two or three horſe-hairs twiſted together, and forming a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knot. They are placed round the juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or ſervice-trees in the neighbourhood of a fountain or a mere, and when the place is well choſen, and the ſprings properly ſet, ſeveral
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1084500103:274"/>
hundred Thruſhes have been caught in a day in the ſpace of a hundred acres.</p>
               <p>It is aſcertained from obſervations made in different countries, that when the Thruſhes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Europe about the beginning of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, they arrive from the countries of the north in company with thoſe numerous flocks of birds which, on the approach of winter, traverſe the Baltic ſea, and leave Lapland, Siberia, Livonia, Poland, and Pruſſia, for more temperate climates. So abundant are the Thruſhes then on the ſouthern ſhore of the Baltic, that, according to the computation of Klein, the ſingle city of Dantzic conſumes every year ninety thouſand pairs. It is equally certain that the ſurvivors which emigrate again after the rigors of winter, direct their courſe towards the north. But the different ſpecies arrive not all of them at the ſame time. In Burgundy, the Throſtle appears the firſt about the end of September, next the Red-Wing, and laſt of all, the Fieldfare and the Miſſel; but the latter ſpecies is much leſs nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than the three others, which might be expected, ſince it is more diſperſed.</p>
               <p>We muſt not ſuppoſe that all the ſpecies of Thruſhes paſs conſtantly in the ſame number; ſometimes they are very few, becauſe the ſeaſon has either been unfavourable to their multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to their migration<note n="*" place="bottom">I am aſſured that ſome years the Red-Wings are very rare in Provence; and this is the caſe alſo in the northern countries.</note>; at other times they

                  </note> they aſſembled and reſted in the iſlets of Pontia, Palmaria, and Pandataria, which are nigh the Italian coaſts. They repoſe too in the iſland of Malta, where they arrive in October and November; the north-weſt wind brings ſome flocks, the ſouth or ſouth-weſt ſometimes beats them back. But they do not always ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive with certain winds, and their appearance depends oftener on the ſtate of the air than on its motion; for if, in calm weather, the ſky ſuddenly darkens with the preludes of a ſtorm, the ground is then covered with Thruſhes.</p>
               <p>Nor does the iſland of Malta appear to limit the migration of the Thruſhes towards the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1084500103:276"/>
ſouth; for they are found in the interior parts of the African continent, from whence they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually paſs, it is ſaid, into Spain<note n="*" place="bottom">

The people of the country told me that every year at the ſame ſeaſon ſuch flocks arrive, but that moſt of them proceed much further.</q> Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fact, I ſtill doubt whether theſt Thruſhes really come from Africa; for this would be contrary to their uſual route, and the tendency of their flight on their arrival is no proof of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their whole courſe.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which remain in Europe ſpend the ſummer in the mountain foreſts: and on the approach of winter, they remove from the heart of the woods where the fruits and inſects begin to fail, and ſettle on the ſkirts of the adjacent plains. It is, no doubt, during this flitting that in the beginning of November ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are caught in the foreſt of Compigne.

nearly a third of the total length of the bird, which varies in the different ſpecies between eight and eleven inches, and is only two-thirds of the alar extent; the wings when cloſed reach as far as the middle of the tail, and the weight of the bird is between two ounces and a half and four and a half.</p>

               <p>THIS ſpecies, in the French language, gives name to the whole genus. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ranged it in the firſt place, though in point of ſize it occupies only the third. It is very common in ſome parts of Burgundy, and called by the country people <hi>The Little Thruſh</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Grivette.</note>, or <hi>Little Red-Wing</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mauviette.</note>. It commonly arrives every year about the time of vintage, probably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the maturity of the grapes; and hence undoubtedly it has received the name of <hi>Vine-Thruſh.</hi> It diſappears during the froſts, and again makes a tranſient viſit in the months of March or April before its migration in May. On the departure of the flock, they always leave a few ſtragglers behind, which are either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to follow the main body, or, yielding to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1084500103:279"/>
the mild influence of ſpring, ſtop and breed in the foreſts that occur in their route<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lottinger aſſures me, that they arrive in the months of March and April in the mountains of Lorraine, and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in September and October. Hence it would follow that in theſe mountains, or rather in foreſts that cover them, they paſs the ſummer, and from theſe retreats viſit us in autumn. But muſt we apply this local remark of Lottinger's to the whole ſpecies? Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations alone will decide.</note>. This is the reaſon why ſome Throſtles conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in our woods, where they build their neſt on the wild apple and pear-trees, and even in junipers and in the buſhes, as has been obſerved in Sileſia<note n="†" place="bottom">Friſch.</note> and in England<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Britiſh Zoology.</bibl>
                  </note>. Sometimes they fix it in the trunk of a thick tree ten or twelve feet high, and prefer, for the materials, wood rotten and worm-eaten.</p>
               <p>They generally pair about the end of winter, and form laſting unions. They make two hatches in the year, and ſometimes a third, when their former have not ſucceeded. The firſt laying conſiſts of five or ſix eggs, of a deep blue with black ſpots, moſt frequent at the large end; and in the ſubſequent hatches the number regularly diminiſhes. It is difficult in this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to ſeparate the males from the females; their ſize being the ſame in both ſexes, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of their plumage, as I have ſaid, ſubject to vary. Aldrovandus ſaw, and cauſed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated, three of theſe birds, caught in different
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1084500103:280"/>
ſeaſons; all which differed in the colours of their bill, of their legs, and of their feathers: in one of them the ſtreaks on the breaſt were hardly perceptible. Friſch aſſerts, however, that the old males have a white ray above the eyes, and Linnaeus makes theſe white eyelids one of the characters of the ſpecies. Almoſt all the other naturaliſts agree, that the young males can hardly be diſtinguiſhed but by their early inclination to chant: for the Throſtle ſings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully, eſpecially in the ſpring<note n="*" place="bottom">On its firſt arrival, about the end of winter, it has only a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whiſtle, day and night, like the Ortolans.</note>, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it announces; and as it breeds ſeveral times in the year, it enjoys a ſucceſſion of the vernal pleaſures, and may be ſaid to warble three-fourths of the year. It ſits whole hours on the top of a tall tree, ſtraining its delicate throat. Its warbling conſiſts of ſeveral different couplets, like that of the Miſſel, but ſtill more varied and more charming; which has obtained for it in many countries the denomination of the <hi>Singing Thruſh.</hi> The ſong is undoubtedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to attract the female; for even the imperfect imitation of it will produce that effect.</p>
               <p>Each brood follows ſeparately their parents; ſometimes ſeveral of theſe chancing to meet in the ſame wood, would induce us to think that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1084500103:281"/>
they aſſociate in numerous flocks<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.—Dr. Lottinger alſo ſays, that though they do not migrate in troops, many are found together or pretty nigh each other.</note>; but their union is fortuitous and momentary; the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſoon ſeparate, and even the individuals diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe after they are able to provide ſingly their ſubſiſtence<note n="†" place="bottom">I am aſſured, however, that they like the company of the Calendar Larks.</note>.</p>

               <p>Though the Throſtle is quick-ſighted, and very alert to avoid its declared enemies, and to eſcape from manifeſt dangers; it has at bottom but little cunning, and is quite unguarded againſt concealed ſtratagems: it is eaſily caught either by the call or the gin, though leſs ſo than the Red-Wing. In ſome parts of Poland, ſuch numbers are taken that ſmall barks are loaded with them for exportation<note n="§" place="bottom">Rzaczinſki.</note>. It is a bird that delights in woods, and in ſuch places the ſnares may be laid with ſucceſs. It ſeldom is met with in the plains, and even when it viſits the vines it conſtantly retires into the neighbouring copſes in the evening, and during the heat of the day;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1084500103:282"/>
ſo that to ſucceed in catching the Throſtle, we ought to chooſe the proper time; its departure in the morning, and its return in the evening, or the mid-day, when the ſun's rays are moſt oppreſſive. Sometimes they are intoxicated with eating ripe grapes, and then they fall an eaſy prey.</p>
               <p>Willughby informs us, that this ſpecies breeds in England, and reſides there the whole year; and he adds, that its fleſh is excellent, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the quality of its food. Our Throſtle ſubſiſts in autumn on cheſnuts, beech-maſt, grapes, figs, ivy-berries, juniper-berries, the fruit of the ſervice-tree, and ſuch like aliments. We are not ſo certain what it lives upon in the ſpring. In that ſeaſon it commonly appears on the ground in the woods, in wet places, and among the buſhes which ſkirt the flooded mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, where it may be ſuppoſed to ſearch for earth-worms, ſnails, &amp;c. If an intenſe vernal froſt happens, the Throſtles, inſtead of flying to milder climates, retire to the ſprings, and languiſh and pine; and a continuance of this ſevere weather will deſtroy many of them. This would ſeem to ſhew, that cold is not the ſole cauſe of their migrations, but that they have a certain circuit to deſcribe annually in a given time. It is ſaid that pomegranates prove a poiſon to them. In Bugey, the neſts of the Throſtles are much ſought after, or rather

               <p>I ſhould ſuppoſe that this ſpecies was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the ancients; for Ariſtotle reckons only three kinds<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I have obſerved in a Throſtle which lived ſome time with me, that when it was angry it cracked and ſnapped with its bill; its upper mandible was alſo moveable, though much leſs than the lower; alſo its tail was ſomewhat forked, which is not very evident from the figure<note n="‡" place="bottom">Specific character of the Throſtle, <hi>Turdus Muſicus,</hi> LINN.—<q rend="inline">Its wing-quills are ferruginous at their inner baſe.</q> It is nine inches long, and its alar extent thirteen and a half.

                  <p n="1">1. The WHITE THROSTLE. The ſole difference conſiſts in the whiteneſs of its plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; a quality which, though commonly aſcribed to the influence of the northern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, may be produced by accidental cauſes in the more temperate countries, as we have remarked in the hiſtory of the Raven: but this colour is not ſpread over the whole body, nor is it pure. The breaſt and neck are marked with the ſpeckles peculiar to the Thruſhes, though far more dilute and faint; the back is ſhaded with a mixture of brown, and the breaſt tinged with rufous, as in thoſe figured by Friſch, pl. 33, but without any deſcription. Sometimes none of the upper part of the body, except the head, is white, as in that deſcribed by Aldrovandus; at other times the lower part of the neck only is marked by a white-croſs-bar, like a half col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and, in different individuals, this colour certainly mingles variouſly with thoſe proper to the ſpecies.—But diſtinctions of that ſort can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not form even permanent varieties.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The CRESTED THRUSH, mentioned by Schwenckfeld, muſt alſo be regarded as a variety of this ſpecies; not only becauſe it is of the ſame ſize, and its plumage ſimilar, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                  <p>This birds occurs not only in Canada, but in Pennſylvania, Carolina, and as far as Jamaica: it ſpends only the ſummer in the northern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; though in the milder regions of the ſouth it reſides the whole year. In Carolina it haunts the thickeſt woods contiguous to the ſwamps; but in the hotter climate of Jamaica it retires to the foreſts that cover the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                  <p>The ſpecimens deſcribed or figured by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts differ in the colours of their feathers, of their bill, and of their legs; which would imply (if they all belong to the ſame ſpecies), that the plumage of the American Throſtles is no leſs variable than thoſe of Europe, and that they all ſpring from a common ſtem. This conjecture derives force from the numerous analogies which this bird has to the Thruſhes, in its ſhape, in its port, in its propenſity to migrate, and to feed upon berries, in the yellow colour of its internal parts, obſerved by Sloane, and in the ſpeckles
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1084500103:288"/>
which appear on its breaſt; but it ſeems the moſt nearly related to our Throſtle and Red-Wing, and a compariſon of the points of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity is neceſſary to determine the ſpecies to which it belongs.</p>
                  <p>This bird is ſmaller than any of our Thruſhes, as in general are all the birds of America, if compared with their archetypes in the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Like the Red-Wing, it does not ſing, and has fewer ſpeckles than that ſpecies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore than any of the genus; like the Red-Wing alſo, its fleſh is delicate.—So far the American Thruſh reſembles the Red-Wing, but it has more numerous relations to our Throſtle; and, in my opinion, more deciſive ones. It has beards round the bill, a ſort of yellowiſh plate on the breaſt; it readily ſettles and remains in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which affords it ſubſiſtence; its cry is like the winter-notes of the Throſtle, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, as generally are the cries of all birds that live in wild countries inhabited by ſavages. Beſides, the Throſtle, and not the Red-Wing, is found in Sweden, whence it could eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate into America.</p>
                  <p>This Throſtle arrives in Pennſylvania in the month of May; it continues there the whole of the ſummer, during which time it hatches and raiſes its young. Cateſby tells us, that few of theſe Throſtles are ſeen in Carolina, whether becauſe a part only ſettle of what arrive, or that, as we have already obſerved, they conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

                  <p>In the ſpecimens deſcribed by Sloane, the noſtrils were wider, and the feet longer than in thoſe deſcribed by Cateſby and Briſſon. Nor was their plumage the ſame; and if theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were conſtant, we ſhould have reaſon to conclude that they belong to another family, or at leaſt are a permanent variety of this ſpecies. <note n="A" place="bottom">Gmelin and Latham make the American and the Jamaica Throſtle to be two different ſpecies.

In Burgundy, the Miſſels arrive in flocks about the months of September and October, coming moſt probably from the mountains of Lorraine<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lottinger of Sarbourg aſſures me, that ſuch of the Thruſhes as remove from the mountains of Lorraine on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of winter, depart in September and October, and return in the months of March and April; and that they breed in the foreſts with which the mountains are covered, &amp;c. This account agrees well with what we have given from our own obſervation. But I muſt confeſs that another remark of that gentleman diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrees with one of a very intelligent ornithologiſt: The latter (M. Hebert) pretends that in Brie the Thruſhes aſſemble at no time of the year; whereas M. Lottinger aſſerts that in Lorraine they always fly in flocks, and in fact they ſeem to arrive in troops about Montbard, as I have remarked. Can their habits differ in different countries, or in different times? This is not altogether unexampled; and I muſt add, from a more particular obſervation, that after the November paſſage is over, thoſe which remain in our diſtricts live ſeparately till the time of hatching: in ſhort, that the aſſertions of theſe two obſervers may be true, with certain reſtrictions.</note>. Part of them purſue their journey, and depart always in numerous bodies in the beginning of winter, while the reſt remain till the month of March; for ſome of them always continue during the ſummer both in Burgundy, and in other provinces of France, of Germany, of Poland<note n="†" place="bottom">Rzaczynſki.</note>, &amp;c. In Italy alſo, and in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſo many neſtle that Aldrovandus ſaw the new brood ſold in the markets; and Albin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Miſſels as not birds of paſſage<note n="‡" place="bottom">The authors of the Britiſh Zoology are of the ſame opinion.</note>. Thoſe

which remain lay and hatch ſucceſsfully. They build their neſts, ſometimes in trees of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling height, and ſometimes on the top of ſuch as are extremely tall, but always prefer thoſe which are moſt covered with moſs. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct both the inſide and outſide with herbage, leaves, and moſs, eſpecially the white moſs; and their neſt reſembles more that of the Blackbird than of the other Thruſhes, except its being lined with bedding. They lay four or five gray-ſpotted eggs; they feed their young with caterpillars, worms, ſlugs, and even ſnails, the ſhell of which they break. The parents eat all ſorts of berries during the ſummer, cherries, grapes, olives, the fruits of the cornel and the ſervice-trees; and in winter they ſubſiſt upon the berries of the juniper, of the holly, of the ivy, of the buck-thorn; upon beech-maſt, ſloes, fennel, and, above all, upon miſletoe berries. When diſturbed they cry <hi>tré, tré, tré</hi>; hence their name in the dialect of Burgundy <hi>draine</hi> and even ſome of the Engliſh names. In the ſpring the females have no other notes; but the males, ſitting on the tops of the trees, ſing charmingly, and their warble conſiſts of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent airs that form a conſtantly varied ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. In winter they are no longer heard. The male differs not in external appearance from the female, except that he has more black in his plumage.</p>

Theſe birds are of a gentle pacific temper; they never fight with one another, but yet are anxious for their own ſafety. They are more cautious even than the Blackbirds, which are generally reckoned very ſhy and timorous; for theſe are ſometimes decoyed by the call, while the Miſſels reſiſt the allurement. They are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, caught ſometimes in gins, though leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than the Throſtles or Red-Wings.</p>
                  <p>Belon aſſerts, that the fleſh of the Miſſel, which he calls the Great Thruſh, is of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior flavour to that of the other ſpecies; but this is contrary to the account of all other natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and to my own experience. Our Miſſels live not indeed upon olives, nor our ſmall Throſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles upon miſletoe-berries, as thoſe of which he ſpeaks; and it is well known how much the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of food affects the quality of game<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Turdus Viſcivorus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its back is duſky, its neck ſpotted with white, its bill yellowiſh.</q> The Minel Thruſh reſembles much the Throſtle, but the ſpots on its breaſt are large and round, not elongated as in the latter; and the inner coverts of its wings are white, thoſe of the Throſtle yellow. It is alſo of ſuperior ſize; for it is eleven inches long, ſixteen and a half broad, and weighs near five ounces. It builds its neſt in buſhes, or in the ſides of trees, particularly the aſh.</note>.</p>

                     <p>The only variety I find in this ſpecies is the Whitiſh Miſſel noticed by Aldrovandus. The quills of its tail and wings were of a light and almoſt whitiſh colour, the head and all the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-part of the body cinereous.</p>
                     <p>We may remark in this variety the alteration of the colour of the quills, of the wings, and of the tail, which are commonly ſuppoſed to be the leaſt liable to change, and as being of a deeper dye than the other feathers.</p>
                     <p>I may add that there are always ſome Miſſels which breed in the Royal Garden on the leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs trees; they ſeem to be very fond of yew berries, and eat ſo plentifully of them that their excrements are red; they are alſo attached to the fruit of the lote.</p>
                     <p>In Provence the people have a ſort of call with which they imitate the vernal ſong of the Miſſel Thruſh and of the Throſtle. The perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals himſelf in a green arbour, from which he can ſee through a loop-hole a pole, which he has faſtened to a neighbouring tree; the Thruſhes are invited by the call, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to meet with their companions, alight on the pole, and fall by the ſhot of the fowler.</p>

               <p>THIS Thruſh is the largeſt after the Miſſel; and like it can hardly be decoyed by the call, but may be caught by a nooſe. It differs from the other Thruſhes by the yellow colour of its bill, the deeper brown of its legs, and the cinereous ſometimes variegated with black, which ſpreads over its head, behind its neck, and upon its rump.</p>
               <p>The male and female have the ſame cry, which will equally attract the wild Fieldfares in the ſeaſon of migration<note n="†" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>. But the female is diſtinguiſhed from the male by the colour of her bill, which is much duller. Theſe birds, which breed in Poland and Lower Auſtria<note n="‡" place="bottom">Klein, and Kramer.</note>, never neſtle in France. They arrive in flocks with the Red-Wing about the beginning of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, and make a loud noiſe as they fly<note n="§" place="bottom">Rzaczynſki.</note>.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1084500103:300"/>
They haunt the unploughed fields which are interſperſed with juniper buſhes, and when they appear again in the ſpring<note n="*" place="bottom">They arrive in England about the beginning of October, and depart in the month of May. <bibl>BRITISH ZOOLOGY.</bibl>
                  </note>, they prefer the wet meadows. In general they inhabit the woods much leſs than the two preceding ſpecies. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they make an early but tranſient appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance when the ſervices are ripe, of which they are very fond, though they nevertheleſs return at the uſual time.</p>
               <p>It is not an uncommon thing to ſee the Fieldfares aſſemble to the number of two or three thouſand in a ſpot where there are ripe ſervices, which they devour with ſuch voracity, that they throw half of them on the ground. After rains they frequently run along the ditches in ſearch of worms and ſlugs. In the time of hard froſts, they live upon the haws of the white-thorn, the berries of the miſletoe, and thoſe of other plants<note n="†" place="bottom">Lottinger.</note>.</p>
               <p>We may infer then that the Fieldfares are of a much more ſocial diſpoſition than the Throſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or the Miſſels. They ſometimes go ſingle, but for the moſt part they form, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remarked, very numerous flocks, fly in a body, and ſpread through the meadows in ſearch of food, never loſing ſight of their ſociety. They all collect together upon the ſame tree at certain hours of the day, or when at any time
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1084500103:301"/>
they are alarmed at the near approach of a perſon.</p>
               <p>Linnaeus mentions a Fieldfare, which was bred in the houſe of a wine-merchant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo familiar that it would run along the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and drink the wine out of the glaſſes; it drank ſo much that it grew bald, but being ſhut up in its cage and denied wine, it recovered its plumage<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>

                  </note>. This little anecdote preſents two remarkable facts; the effect of wine upon the feathers of a bird, and the inſtance of a tame Fieldfare, which is very uncommon; for the Thruſhes cannot be, as I have before ſaid, eaſily domeſticated.</p>
               <p>The Fieldfares are the more numerous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſeverity of the weather; they ſeem to be even a ſign of its continuance, for the fowlers and thoſe who live in the country judge that the winter is not over as long as the Fieldfares are heard. They retire in ſummer into the northern countries, where they breed and find abundance of junipers. Friſch aſcribes to this ſort of food the excellent quality he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in their fleſh. I own that there is no diſputing about taſtes, but I muſt ſay that in Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy this Thruſh is reckoned very indifferent eating, and that in general the flavour commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by juniper is always ſomewhat bitter. Others aſſert that the fleſh of the Fieldfares is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1084500103:302"/>
never better or more ſucculent than when it feeds on worms and inſects.</p>
               <p>The Fieldfare was known by the ancients un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Turdus Pilaris</hi>; not becauſe it has been always caught with a nooſe, as Salerne ſays, a quality which would not have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed it from the other Thruſhes, but becauſe the hairs or black briſtles round its bill, which project forwards, are longer in this ſpecies than in the Throſtle or the Miſſel. We may add, that its claws are very ſtrong, as remarked in the Britiſh Zoology. Friſch relates, that if the young of the Miſſel be put in a Fieldfare's neſt, it will feed and educate them as its own; but I would not thence infer, as Friſch has done, that we might expect to obtain an hybridous race; for no perſon ſurely looks for a new breed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hen and the drake, though the hen often rears whole hatches of ducklings. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Fieldfare, <hi>Turdus Pilaris:</hi>—<q rend="inline">Its tail-quills are black, the outermoſt whitiſh at the tip of their inner margin, the tail and rump hoary.</q> It is ten inches long, ſeventeen broad, and weighs four ounces. The Fieldfares never breed in Great Britain, but arrive in flocks with the Red-Wings in the end of September, and retire in the beginning of March: but what is ſingular, they appear for a fortnight about Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and again for about a week in April. Linnaeus and Latham think that the Fieldfares were the Thruſhes which the Romans fattened in their voleries.</note>

                  <p>The PIED or SPOTTED FIELDFARE. It is variegated with white, black, and many other colours, ſo diſtributed that except the head and the neck, which are white ſpotted with black, and the tail, which is entirely black, the duſky hues, interſperſed with white ſpots, prevail on the upper-part of the body; and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the light colours, eſpecially the white, are ſpread over the lower-part marked with black ſpeckles, moſt of which are ſhaped like ſmall creſcents. This Fieldfare is of the ordinary ſize.</p>
                  <p>We ought to refer to this the <hi>White-headed Fieldfare</hi> of Briſſon. It has no black ſpeckles, and as its white is what alone diſtinguiſhes it from the common Fieldfare, we may conſider it as intermediate between that and the Spotted Fieldfare.

                  <p>Fieldfare is the name which Cateſby applies to the Thruſh deſcribed and figured in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory of Carolina; and I adopt it the more readily, ſince that ſpecies ſpends at leaſt a part of the year in Sweden, and could thence migrate into the New World, and produce other varieties. In the Canada Fieldfare the orbits are white, there is a ſpot of the ſame colour between the eye and the bill, the upper-part of the body is brown, the under orange before, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated behind with dirty white and ruſty brown, ſhaded with a greeniſh tinge; there are alſo ſome ſpeckles under its throat, whoſe ground colour is white. In winter it advances in numerous flocks from the northern parts of America to Virginia and Carolina, and returns in the ſpring. It reſembles our Fieldfare in this circumſtance, but it ſings better<note n="*" place="bottom">We muſt remember that the ſong of a bird cannot be known unleſs it be heard in the ſeaſon of love, and that the Fieldfare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breeds in our climates.</note>.

but ſeldom or never ſettles in our provinces, or in Lorraine, where it arrives in April, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires about the end of the ſame month, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not again till autumn; though that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try affords abundance of proper food in its vaſt foreſts. It halts there a certain time at leaſt, and does not, as Friſch aſſerts, remove merely into ſome parts of Germany. Its common food is berries and ſmall worms, which it finds by ſcraping the ground. It is diſtinguiſhed from the other Thruſhes, by its feathers being more gloſſy and ſhining, its bill and eyes of a deeper black than the Throſtle, whoſe ſize it approaches, and by its having fewer ſpeckles on the breaſt. It is alſo remarkable for the orange colour under its wing, a circumſtance which has occaſioned its being called in ſeveral languages, <hi>Red-winged Thruſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its ordinary cry is <hi>tan, tan, kan, kan</hi>; and when it perceives a fox, its natural enemy, it leads him off to a great diſtance; as do alſo the Blackbirds, repeating always the ſame notes. Moſt naturaliſts remark that it never ſings; but this aſſertion needs to be qualified, and we can only ſay that it is ſeldom heard to ſing in countries where it does not appear in the ſeaſon of love, as in France, England, &amp;c. An excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, M. Hebert, has informed me, that he has witneſſed its chanting in the ſpring in Brie; twelve or fifteen of them ſat on a tree and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled like linnets. Another obſerver, who lives
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1084500103:309"/>
in the ſouth of Provence, tells me, that the Red-Wing only whiſtles, which it does inceſſantly; we may infer, therefore, that it does not breed in that country.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle mentions it by the name of <hi>Ilian Thruſh,</hi> as being the ſmalleſt and the leaſt ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Thruſhes<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <p>I have traced an analogy between this ſpecies and the Fieldfare. They are both foreign, and only viſit our climate twice a year<note n="†" place="bottom">In natural Hiſtory, as in many other ſubjects, general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations always admit of exceptions. Though for the moſt part the Red-Wing does not ſpend the winter in our climates, I am aſſured by M.

But the Red-Wing is alſo related to the Throſtle; its fleſh is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in quality, the under-ſurface of its wing is yellow, but more lively indeed, and of an orange tinge; it often occurs ſingle in the woods, and viſits the vineyards, like the Throſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with which Lottinger has obſerved it often to fly in company, eſpecially in the ſpring. From the whole it appears that this ſpecies is furniſhed with the means of ſubſiſting of the other two,

                  <p>Such is nearly the deſcription of the external appearance of this bird; but we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with regard to its inſtincts and habits. If it be really a Thruſh, as it is ſaid, its breaſt is like that of the Red Thruſh, not dappled.</p>

                  <p>The ſpecimen figured by Edwards, Pl. 252, differs from ours in not being dappled under the belly. It was caught in November 1751, at ſea, eight or ten leagues off the iſland of St. Domingo; which led Edwards to ſuppoſe that it was one of thoſe birds of paſſage which every

year leave the continent of North America on the approach of winter, and depart from the Cape of Florida in queſt of milder ſeaſons. This conjecture was verified. Bartram informed Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that theſe birds arrived in Pennſylvania in the month of April, and remained there dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole ſummer. He added, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male built its neſt on the ground, or rather in heaps of dry leaves, where it formed a ſort of excavation; that it lined it with graſs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways choſe the ſlope of a hill facing the ſouth, and that it layed four or five eggs ſpotted with brown. Such differences in the colour of the eggs, in that of the plumage, and in the mode of neſtling, ſeem to point at a nature diſtinct from that of our European Thruſhes.</p>

Such is the caſe with the American Mocking Birds. It is eaſy to perceive that Briſſon's Mocking Bird, and the Cinereous Blackbird of St. Domingo, <hi>Pl.

In like manner we ſhall find that the <hi>Tzonpan</hi> of Fernandez is either the female of the <hi>Cencontlatolli,</hi> that is, of the Mocking Bird, as Fernandez himſelf ſuſpects, or at leaſt a permanent variety of that ſpecies<note n="*" place="bottom">

Beſides, the reſemblance between the names <hi>Tzonpan, Tetzonpan, Centzonpantli,</hi> ſeems to ſhew that they mark a ſingle ſpecies, and that the diverſity has ariſen from the miſtake of the tranſcriber, or the difference of the Mexican dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.—Laſtly, we can ſcarcely heſitate to admit among the ſpecies the bird, called by Briſſon the <hi>Great Mocking Bird,</hi> and which he ſays is the ſame with Sloane's Mocking Bird, though, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dimenſions given by Sloane, this is the ſmalleſt of the kind; but Sloane regards it as the <hi>Cencontlatolli</hi> of Fernandez, which Briſſon makes his ordinary Mocking Bird. But Briſſon has himſelf, without perceiving it, admitted the poſition which I hold; for he quotes two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages from Ray, which applied to the ſame bird, and refers one to his great, and the other to his ſmall ſpecies. The only difference between the two is, that the great Mocking Bird has a

ſomewhat browner plumage, and longer legs<note n="*" place="bottom">The expreſſion of Sloane is ſomewhat ambiguous; he ſays that its legs and feet are an inch and three quarters long.

               <p>None of the American Mocking Birds reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſo much our Thruſhes in the ſpeckles on the breaſt, as this; but it differs widely from them in the proportions between the tail and wings, theſe ending, when cloſed, almoſt where the tail begins. The tail is more than four inches long, which exceeds the third of the whole length of the bird, that being only eleven
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1084500103:321"/>
inches. Its ſize is intermediate between that of the Miſſel and the Fieldfare. Its eyes are yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, its bill blackiſh, its legs brown, and all the upper-part of the body of a fox colour, but with a mixture of brown. Theſe two colours alſo predominate on the wing-quills, though ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; the rufous on the outer webs, the brown on the inner. The great and middle coverts of the wings are tipt with white, which forms two ſtreaks that croſs the wings obliquely.</p>
               <p>The under-ſide of the body is dirty white, ſpotted with a duſky brown, but theſe ſpots are more ſtraggling than in our Thruſhes: the tail is tapered ſomewhat drooping, and entirely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fous. The ſong of the French Mocking Bird has ſome variety, but not comparable to that of the proper Mocking Bird.</p>
               <p>It feeds commonly on a kind of black cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are very different from thoſe of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, ſince they hang in cluſters. It remains all the year in Carolina and Virginia, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is not, at leaſt in thoſe provinces, a bird of paſſage:—another analogous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to our Thruſhes<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Turdus Rufus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is rufous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low partly ſpotted with white, its wing-quills of an uniform co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, its tail rounded and rufous.</q> It inhabits North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; appears in New-York in May, and retires ſouthwards in Auguſt. It builds in low buſhes, and lays five eggs, thick ſpotted with ferruginous. It is much inferior in the variety of its notes to the true Mocking Bird.</note>.</p>

               <p>We have here a ſtriking exception to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remark made by travellers, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the plumage of the birds in the New World are rich, elegant, and ſplendid, ſo their notes are harſh, raucous, and monotonous. The Mocking Bird is, on the contrary, if we believe Fernandez, Nieremberg, and the native Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, the ſweeteſt choriſter of the feathered race, not excepting the Nightingale. It equals that charming bird in the melody of its ſong; but it poſſeſſes beſides the power of imitating the cries of other animals: hence is derived its name. Nor is it ſatisfied with barely re-echoing the ſounds. It gives them ſoftneſs and grace. Accordingly the ſavages have beſtowed upon it the appellation of <hi>cencontlatolli</hi>; that is, four hundred languages; and the learned have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the epithet <hi>polyglot.</hi> But the Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bird mingles action with its ſong, and its meaſured movements accompany and expreſs the ſucceſſion of its emotions. Its prelude is to riſe ſlowly with expanded wings, and ſoon
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1084500103:323"/>
ſink back to the ſame ſpot, its head hanging downwards. Its action now correſponds with the varied nature of its muſic. If the notes are briſk and lively, it deſcribes in the air a number of circles croſſing each other; or it aſcends and deſcends continually in a ſpiral line. If they are loud and rapid, it with equal briſkneſs flaps its wings. Is its ſong unequal? it flutters, it bounds. Do its tones ſoften by degrees, melt into tender ſtrains, and die away in a pauſe more charming than the ſweeteſt melody? it gently diminiſhes its action, glides ſmoothly above its tree, till the wavings of its wings begin to be imperceptible, at leaſt ceaſe, and the bird re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſuſpended and motionleſs in the air.</p>
               <p>The plumage of this American Nightingale by no means correſponds with the beauty of its ſong; the colours are very ordinary, and have neither brilliancy nor variety. The upper-ſide of the body is a grayiſh brown; the upper-ſide of the wings and of the tail are ſtill of a deeper brown; only it is interrupted, 1. on the wings by a white mark which croſſes it obliquely near the middle of its length, and ſometimes a few ſmall white ſpeckles are ſcattered on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. 2. On the tail by an edging of the ſame white colour; and laſtly, on the head with a circle of the ſame, which forms a ſort of crown<note n="*" place="bottom">Fernandez.</note>, and extending over the eyes appears like two diſtinct eye-lids. The under-ſide of the body
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1084500103:324"/>
is white from the throat as far as the end of the tail. We perceive in the figure given by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a few dapples, ſome on the ſides of the neck, and others on the white of the great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts under the wings.</p>
               <p>The Mocking Bird approaches the Red-Wing in ſize; its tail is ſomewhat tapered<note n="*" place="bottom">This appears not in Sloane's figure.</note>, and its feet are blackiſh; its bill is of the ſame colour, and with long briſtles that grow above the angles of its opening; laſtly, its wings are ſhorter than thoſe of our Thruſhes, but longer than thoſe of the French Mocking Bird.</p>
               <p>It is found in Carolina, Jamaica, New Spain, &amp;c. It in general loves the hot climates, but can ſubſiſt in the temperate. In Jamaica it is very common in the ſavannas of the woody parts of the iſland; it perches on the higheſt branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and chants its ſong. It often builds its neſt on the ebony trees. Its eggs are ſpotted with brown. It feeds on cherries and the berries of the white-thorn and cornel tree<note n="†" place="bottom">The Dogwood, <hi>Cornus Florida,</hi> Linn.</note>, and even on inſects. Its fleſh is eſteemed excellent. It is not eaſily raiſed in a cage; but this may be accompliſhed by care and kind treatment. It is beſides a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar bird, which ſeems to be fond of man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches his dwellings, and even perches on the chimney tops.</p>

               <p>THE adult male of this ſpecies is of a deeper and purer black than the Raven, and hence its Engliſh name. Indeed, except the orbits, the talons, and the ſole of the foot, which have always a yellow caſt, it is entirely black in every poſition. In the female, on the contrary, the ſame decided black is not ſpread through the whole of the plumage; it is mixed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhades of brown, ferruginous, and gray, the bill is but ſeldom yellow, and the ſong is different from that of the male;—all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances combined have made it be miſtaken for a bird of another ſpecies.</p>
               <p>The Blackbirds are diſtinguiſhed from the Thruſhes not only by the colour of their plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the different livery of the male and of the female, but by their ſong and their natural habits. They never fly in flocks like the

with regard to each other, they are leſs ſo with regard to man; for they
are more eaſily tamed, and live nearer the hamlets. They are alſo rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
very crafty, becauſe they have a quick ſight to deſcry the fowler at a
diſtance, and ſhun his approach. But if we ſtudy their nature more
cloſely, we ſhall find that they are more reſtleſs than cunning, more
timorous than ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, ſince they allow themſelves to be caught
with bird-lime, with nooſes, and with all ſorts of ſnares, provided the
hand which ſets theſe be concealed.</p>
               <p>When they are ſhut up with other birds, their natural inquietude degenerates into petulance; they purſue and continually haraſs their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in ſlavery; and for that reaſon they cannot be admitted into voleries, where ſeveral kinds of ſmall birds are kept.</p>
               <p>They may be raiſed apart for the ſake of their ſong; not indeed on account of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural muſic, which is hardly tolerable except in the fields, but becauſe they have a facility of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their notes and of learning others, of imitating tones of different inſtruments<note n="*" place="bottom">

as they have more than one hatch, they chant before the vernal warmth, and continue their ſtrain when the other ſongſters of the grove droop in ſilence.

They are found in the woods, towards the end of the ſummer, in moult, ſome having their head entirely bald: Olina and the author of the Britiſh Zoology ſay, that, like the other birds, it is ſilent during that time; the latter adds, that ſometimes it renews its ſong in the beginning of winter, but moſt commonly it has in that ſeaſon only a harſh diſcordant cry.</p>
               <p>The ancients pretended that in winter its plumage changed into rufous<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>Ibid, lib. x. 29.</bibl>
                  </note>; and Olina, one of the moderns the beſt acquainted with the birds which he deſcribes, ſays, that this happens in autumn: whether it be becauſe this alteration of colour is the effect of moulting, or that the females and the young Blackbirds, which really incline to rufous rather than to black, are then more numerous and oftener ſeen than the adult males.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds make their firſt hatch in the end of winter; it conſiſts of five or ſix eggs of a bluiſh green, with frequent and indiſtinct ſpots
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:1084500103:330"/>
of a ruſt colour. This firſt hatch ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers, becauſe of the ſeverity of the weather; the ſecond ſucceeds better, though it is only of four or five eggs. The Blackbirds neſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed nearly like that of the Thruſhes, except that it is lined with a matting. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly placed in buſhes or trees of a moderate height. They would ſeem naturally diſpoſed to place it near the ground; and experience alone of the danger of ſuch a ſituation inſtructs them to give it ſome elevation<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Moſs, which always occurs on the trunk, and mud, which is to be found at the foot of the tree, or in its neighbourhood, are the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials that form the body of the neſt. Stalks of graſs and ſmall roots are the ſofter ſubſtances with which they line it; and they labour with ſuch aſſiduity that in eight days they complete the work. The female hatches alone, and the male is no farther concerned than in providing her ſubſiſtence. The Author of the <hi>Treatiſe on the Nightingale</hi> affirms, that he has ſeen a young Blackbird of the ſame year, but already ſtrong, cheerfully engage in rearing the infant
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1084500103:331"/>
brood of its own ſpecies; but he does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of its ſex.</p>
               <p>I have remarked that the young drop their feathers more than once the firſt year; and that, at each time, the plumage of the male becomes blacker, and the bill yellower, beginning at its baſe. With regard to the females, they retain, as I have ſaid, the colours of infancy, as they alſo retain moſt of its qualities. However, the inſide of their mouth and throat is yellow, like the males; and in both may be perceived a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent motion of the tail upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with a ſlight ſhudder of the wings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a feeble broken cry.</p>

He adds, that there is always abundance of food, berries of all kinds, grapes, and particularly olives, which in Corſica are not entirely gathered till the end of April.

The wild Blackbirds feed on all ſorts of ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, fruits, and inſects; and as no country is ſo ſterile as not to afford ſome of theſe, and as the Blackbird is reconciled to all climates, it is found in almoſt every part of the world, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying according to the impreſſions which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which are kept in the cage, eat fleſh alſo, either dreſſed or minced, bread, &amp;c. but it is ſaid that the kernels of pomegranates prove poiſonous to them as to the Thruſhes. They are very fond of bathing, and they muſt have plenty of water in the voleries. Their fleſh is good, and not inferior to that of the Miſſel or the Fieldfare, and ſeems even to be preferred to that of the Throſtle and of the Red-Wing, in countries where it can require a ſucculence from the olives, and a perfume from the myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-berries. The birds of prey are as fond of feaſting on them as man, and commit an equal havoc: without that their multiplication would be exceſſive.

                  <p>The only varieties of this ſort which appear to belong to the common Blackbird, are, 1. the White one, which was ſent to Aldrovandus at Rome; and, 2. the White-headed one of the ſame author. Both theſe have the yellow bill and feet of the ordinary ſpecies.</p>

                     <p>Ariſtotle was acquainted with White Ouzels, and made them a diſtinct ſpecies, though they have the ſame ſong and the ſame bulk with the common Ouzel or Blackbird; but he knew that their inſtincts were different, ſince they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the mountains<note n="*" place="bottom">

They are found not only in the mountains of Arcadia, of Savoy, and of Auvergne, but alſo in thoſe of Sileſia, and among the Alps and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennines, &amp;c.<note n="‡" place="bottom">WILLUGHBY.</note>. They are alſo birds of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and migrate with the Ring-Ouzel at the ſame ſeaſon. The white colour of the horſe-ſhoe in the Ring-Ouzel may extend over the reſt of the plumage. I ſhould therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that theſe, though uſually referred to the Blackbirds, belong really to the Ring-Ouzels. In the white one which I obſerved, the quills of the wings and tail were whiter than any of the reſt, and the upper-part of the body, except
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1084500103:340"/>
the top of the head, was of a lighter gray than the under. The bill was brown, with a little yellow on the edges; there was alſo yellow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the throat and on the breaſt, and the legs were of a deep gray brown. It was caught in the vicinity of Montbard in the beginning of November before the froſt; that is, at the exact time of the paſſage of the Ring-Ouzel; for a few days before, two of that ſpecies were brought to me.</p>
                     <p>In thoſe which are ſpotted, the white is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined variouſly with the black; ſometimes it is confined to the quills of the wings and tail, which are commonly ſuppoſed to be leaſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change of colour<note n="*" place="bottom">ALDROVANDUS.</note>; ſometimes it forms a collar that encircles the neck, but is not ſo broad as the white horſe-ſhoe of the Ring-Ouzel. This variety did not eſcape Belon, who ſays that he ſaw in Greece, in Savoy, and in the valley of Maurienne, a great number of collared Black-birds, ſo called on account of a white line which bent quite round the neck. Lottinger, who had an opportunity of obſerving theſe birds in the mountains of Lorraine, where they ſometimes breed, informs me, that they commence breeding very early; that they conſtruct and place their neſt nearly like the Thruſh; that the education of their young is completed before the end of June; that they retire every year, but that the time of their departure is not fixed; that this uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins

about the end of July, and laſts the whole of Auguſt, during which time not one is ſeen in the plain, a proof that they follow the chain of the mountains, but their retreat is uncertain. Lottinger adds, that this bird, which formerly was very common in the Voſges, is now ſeldom found there.</p>

               <p>ALL the ornithologiſts, who have taken notice of this bird, mention it as very rare, as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and little known; that it is ſeen only in its paſſage, and the country to which it belongs is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Linnaeus tells us indeed, that it inhabits Lapland and Switzerland; but he ſays nothing with regard to its inſtincts and mode of life. Aldrovandus, who firſt deſcribed this bird, only remarks that it appears ſometimes in the plains near Bologna, where it is known by the bird-catchers under the name of <hi>Sea-Stare, (Storno Marino)</hi>; that it ſits on the dung-hills, grows very fat, and is excellent eating. Two birds of this kind were found in England, and Edwards ſuppoſes that they were driven thither by the violence of the wind. We have obſerved ſeveral in Burgundy, which had been caught in their paſſage, and it is probable that they purſue their excurſions as far as Spain, if what Klein ſays be

                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:1084500103:344"/> true, that they have a name in the Spaniſh
language.</p>
               <p>The plumage of the male is remarkable; its head and neck, and the quills of its wings and of its tail, are black, with brilliant reflexions which play between green and purple. The belly, the back, the rump, and the ſmall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of the wings are of a roſe colour, which has two tints, the one light, the other deep, with a few black ſpots ſcattered here and there on a kind of ſcapulary, which deſcends above as far as the tail, and below to the abdomen. Beſides, its head is ornamented with a ſort of creſt which reclines like that of the Chatterer, and which muſt have a fine effect when the bird erects it.</p>
               <p>The lower belly, the inferior coverts of the tail and the thighs are of a brown colour; the tarſus and the toes of a dirty orange; the bill partly black, and partly fleſh-coloured. But the diſtribution of theſe colours ſeems not fixed in that part; for in the ſubjects which we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and in thoſe of Aldrovandus, the baſe of the bill was blackiſh, and all the reſt of a fleſh colour; whereas in thoſe examined by Edwards, the point of the bill exhibited the black, which changed by degrees into a dirty orange on the baſe of the bill and on the legs. The under-ſide of the tail ſeemed marbled, the effect produced by the colour of its lower coverts, which are blackiſh and tipt with white.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:1084500103:345"/>
In the female the head is black like that of the male, but not the neck, nor the quills of the tail and of the wings, which are of a lighter tinge; the colours of the ſcapulary are alſo leſs vivid.</p>
               <p>This bird is rather ſmaller than the common Blackbird; its bill, wings, legs, and toes, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably longer. In ſize, figure, and even inſtinct, it is much more analogous to the Ring-Ouzel, for it likewiſe migrates. However, we muſt own, that one of theſe Roſe-coloured Ouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which was killed in England, kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with yellow-billed Blackbirds. Its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, is ſeven inches and three-quarters, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the nails ſeven and a half; its alar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thirteen or fourteen, and its wings, when cloſed, reached almoſt to the middle of the tail. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Turdus Roſeus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a carnation colour, its head, its wings, and its tail, black; the back of its head creſted.</q> It very rarely appears in England.

               <p>THE name indicates ſufficiently the haunts of this bird: it inhabits precipices and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; it is found in the wildeſt parts of Bugey; it ſits commonly on the large ſtones, and conſtantly without cover; ſo that it is difficult to get near it with a fowling-piece, for as ſoon as it perceives the perſon, it removes to another place. Its ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeems to be leſs owing to native wildneſs, than to its apprehenſions of man, and its expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his artifices. Nor is it ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as many other birds to danger from that quarter. The loſs of liberty alone is what it has to dread; for though excellent eating, it is more prized on account of its ſong, which is ſoft, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and much like that of the Pettychaps. It ſoon acquires the notes of other birds, and even learns our muſic. It begins by day-break, and welcomes the return of the morning; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news its ſtrain with the ſetting ſun. If during the night we go near its cage with a light, it
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1084500103:348"/>
immediately ſings; and in the day-time, if it is not warbling, it ſeems humming and preparing new airs.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds conceal their neſts with the utmoſt care, and build them in the holes of the rocks, and in the bottom of the moſt inacceſſible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns.

               <p>Each hatch contains three or four eggs. They feed their young with worms and inſects, on which they live themſelves. They can ſubſiſt however on other food, and when they are raiſed in a cage, it ſucceeds well to give them the ſame paſte as the Nightingales. But they muſt be taken from the neſt; for after they have flown, they cannot be enticed into any kind of ſnare; and if they be caught by ſurpriſe, they will never ſurvive their liberty<note n="*" place="bottom">FRISCH.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Rock Blackbirds are found in many parts of Germany, in the Alps, in the mountains of Tyrol, in thoſe of Bugey, &amp;c. I received a female of this ſpecies caught on its eggs the 12th of May; it had built its neſt on a rock in the neighbourhood of Montberd, where theſe birds are very rare and quite unknown; its colours were not ſo bright as thoſe of the male. This laſt is rather ſmaller than the common Black-bird, and entirely different in its proportions.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:1084500103:349"/>
Its wings are very long, ſuch as would ſuit a bird that neſtles in the bottom of caverns; they meaſure thirteen or fourteen inches when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and if cloſed they reach almoſt to the end of the tail, which is only three inches in length. The bill is about an inch.</p>
               <p>With regard to the plumage, the head and neck are covered as it were with a cinereous cowl, variegated with ſmall ruſty ſpots. The back is darker near the neck, and lighter near the tail. The ten lateral quills of the tail are ferruginous, and the intermediate brown. The wing-quills and their coverts are of a duſky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and edged with a lighter tinge. Laſtly, the breaſt, and all the lower-part of the body, orange, variegated with ſmall ſpeckles, ſome white, others brown; the bill and legs are blackiſh. <note n="A" place="bottom">
                     <p>There are two kinds of Rock Blackbirds, or Ouzels; a greater and a leſſer. The former has ſometimes been denominated a Crow or Shrike.

In ſhort, we might be inclined to refer it to the ſame ſpecies. Accordingly, many naturaliſts have miſtaken the one for the other. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of its plumage vary ſomewhat in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and it is probably ſubject to real va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, ariſing from the difference of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, that of age, of ſex, of climate, &amp;c.

               <p>Belon, who ſaw ſome of theſe birds at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſa in Dalmatia, tells us, that they are alſo found in the iſlands of Negropont, Candia, Zante, Corfu, &amp;c.; that they are very much ſought for, on account of their ſong; but he adds, that they do not inhabit France or Italy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the arm of the ſea which ſeparates Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia from Italy is no inſurmountable barrier, eſpecially to theſe birds, which, according to Belon himſelf, fly much better than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Blackbird, and which could at leaſt make the circuit and penetrate into Italy by the State of Venice. Beſides, it is a fact that theſe Ouzels are found in Italy; the one deſcribed by Briſſon, and that figured in our <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> No. 250, were both ſent from that country.

               <p>THIS alſo is an inhabitant of the mountains, and famous for its elegant ſtrains. It is well known that Francis I. king of France, took ſingular pleaſure in liſtening to it; and even at preſent the male of this ſpecies is tamed and ſold at a very high price at Geneva and Milan<note n="†" place="bottom">Olina, Geſner, Willughby.</note>, and ſtill dearer at Smyrna and Conſtantinople<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is ſometimes ſold in theſe cities for fifty or a hundred pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtres. <bibl>HASSELQUIST.</bibl>
                  </note>. The native warble of the Solitary Ouzel is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely liquid and tender, but rather plaintive, as muſt be the ſong of every bird which leads a lonely exiſtence. It remains always ſingle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the ſeaſon of love. At that joyous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, the male and female not only aſſociate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1084500103:355"/>
but deſert in company the wild and dreary heights where they had lived ſeparately, and reſort to the milder abodes of man. They ſeem to ſeek ſpectators of their pleaſures, and come forward in thoſe intoxicating moments, when other animals court the ſilence of retreat. But they lodge at a conſiderable height above the ſurface, and thus in the midſt of population they ſhun the dangers to which they would be expoſed. They build their neſt with ſtalks of graſs and feathers in the top of a ſeparate chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or on the ruins of an old caſtle, or on the ſummit of a large tree, and almoſt always near a ſteeple or lofty tower. The male ſits whole hours or days upon the vane or weather-cock, and ſoothes the tedious ſituation of his mate by a continual warble; but pathetic as are his ſtrains, they are ſtill inſufficient to expreſs the warmth and tenderneſs of his emotions. A ſolitary bird feels more delicately and ardently than others. Sometimes he riſes chanting, flap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his wings, diſplaying the feathers of his tail, briſtling thoſe on his head, and panting with delight, he deſcribes many circles in the air round his beloved mate as the centre.</p>
               <p>If the female be ſcared by any uncommon noiſe, or by the ſight of any new object, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into her fort, but ſoon returns to the neſt, which ſhe never abandons.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the young are hatched, the male ceaſes to ſing, but not to love; he gives another
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1084500103:356"/>
proof of his affection by ſharing in the trouble of rearing the brood, and bringing proviſions in his bill. In animals the ardor of love is ever proportioned to the tenderneſs for the off-ſpring.</p>
               <p>They commonly lay five or ſix eggs; they feed their young with inſects, on which, and on grapes, they ſubſiſt themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">Willughby, Belon, &amp;c.</note>. They arrive in April in thoſe countries where they paſs the ſummer, and depart about the end of Auguſt; they return every year to the ſame ſpot where they firſt fixed their abode. It is uncommon to ſee more than two pairs ſettled in the ſame tract<note n="†" place="bottom">There is every year a pair of them in the belfry of Sainte-Reine, a ſmall town in my neighbourhood, ſituated on the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a hill of moderate height.</note>.</p>
               <p>The young, when they are taken out of the neſt, are capable of inſtruction, and they learn to chant or to prattle. They begin to ſing at midnight, on the approach of the light of a candle. When well-treated they can live in a cage eight or ten years. They are found on the mountains in France and Italy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Belon.</note>, in almoſt all the iſlands of the Archipelago, eſpecially in Zira and Nia, where it is ſaid they neſtle among the heaps of ſtones<note n="§" place="bottom">Haſſelquiſt.</note>, and in the iſland of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica, where they are not conſidered as birds of paſſage<note n="‖" place="bottom">Artier, Profeſſor of Natural Hiſtory at Baſtia.</note>. But in Burgundy, thoſe which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1084500103:357"/>
in the ſpring, and lodge on the chimney tops, and in ruined churches, were never known to ſpend the winter in that province. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Ouzel may not migrate in Corſica, and yet flit from one part to another, according to the change of ſeaſons, as it does in France.</p>
               <p>The ſingular habits of this bird, and the charms of its ſong, have inſpired in the people a ſort of veneration for it. I know ſome places where it is looked upon as lucky, where they would hardly ſuffer its neſt to be diſturbed, and dread its death as a public misfortune.</p>
               <p>The Solitary Ouzel is rather ſmaller than the common Blackbird, but its bill is ſtronger and more hooked near the point, and the legs are ſhorter in proportion. Its plumage is brown of different ſhades, and ſpeckled throughout with white, except on the rump, and on the feathers of the wings and tail. Alſo, its neck, throat, breaſt, and the coverts of the wings, are in the male of a blue tinge, with purple reflexions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely wanting in the female, which is of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form brown, with yellowiſh ſpeckles. In both, the iris is of an orange yellow, the opening of the noſtrils wide, the edges of the bill ſcalloped near the tip, as in almoſt all the Blackbirds and Thruſhes; the inſide of the mouth yellow, the tongue parted into three threads, of which the mid one is the longeſt; twelve quills in the tail, nineteen in each wing, the firſt of which is very ſhort: laſtly, the firſt <hi>phalanx</hi> of the outer toe
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1084500103:358"/>
is joined to that of the middle one. The total length of the bird is eight or nine inches; its alar extent twelve or thirteen; its tail three; its leg thirteen lines; and its bill fifteen; the wings, when cloſed, reach beyond the middle of the tail. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Turdus Solitarius:</hi>—<q rend="inline">It is duſky, a great part of it ſpotted with white, its tail blackiſh.</q>

                  <p>THIS ſpecies ſeems to be intermediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Solitary Ouzel and the Rock Blackbird. It has the colours of the latter, and diſtributed partly in the ſame order; but its wings are not ſo long, though when cloſed they reach to two-thirds of the tail. Its plumage is a ſlate-blue, uniform on the head, the hind-part of the neck, and the back; almoſt quite blue on the rump, ſpeckled with yellow on the throat, and on the fore-part of the neck and top of the breaſt. The ſame blue colour is deeper on the coverts of the wings, with ſimilar ſpeckles, though ſcattered more ſparingly, and ſome white ſpots, which are ſtill fewer. The reſt of the under-ſide of the body is orange, ſpeckled with blue and white; the quills of the wings and of the tail are blackiſh, and the latter edged with

rufous; laſtly, the bill is brown, and the legs almoſt black.</p>
                  <p>The Penſive Ouzel is nearly of the ſize of the Rock Blackbird; its total length is about eight inches, its alar extent twelve or thirteen, its tail three, its bill only an inch.</p>
                  <p>The female has no blue or orange in its plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but two or three ſhades of brown, which form pretty regular ſpeckles on the head, the back, and all the under-ſide of the body.—Theſe two birds were preſented by M. Sonnerat.</p>

The firſt of theſe ſpots ſeems, from its determined figure, to be the moſt characteriſtic of this ſpecies, and diſtinguiſhes it the beſt from the other collared Blackbirds. This horſe-ſhoe is traced on a yellow ground, which is the colour of the throat and of all the under-ſide of the body, and which appears again between the bill and the eyes; brown predominates on the head and behind the neck, and light gray on the ſides.

Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes it a Blackbird, and Edwards a Pie or a Shrike. For my own part, I conceive it to be a Ring-Ouzel, not venturing, however, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, till farther information clear up the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:1084500103:372"/>
It is ſmaller than the Blackbird, and its bill proportionably ſtronger. Its total length is ſeven inches and a half, its alar extent eleven, its tail three and a half, its bill twelve or thirteen lines, and its legs fourteen; its wings when cloſed reach beyond the middle of its tail, which is ſomewhat tapered.</p>
                  <p>The black breaſt-piece which diſtinguiſhes this bird is the more conſpicuous, as it is bounded above and below by a lighter colour, for the throat and all the under-part of the body is of a pretty bright yellow. From the two ends of the upper-margin of this breaſt-piece ariſe two cords of the ſame colour, which firſt aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each ſide towards the head, define the beautiful yellow orange plate on the throat, and then bending under the eyes, terminate at the baſe of the bill, where they are in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. Two yellow eye-brows, which take their origin cloſe to the noſtrils, embrace the eyes above, and form a contraſt to the black cords. All the upper-part of this bird is olive; but that colour ſeems to be tarniſhed by a mixture of cinereous on the top of the head, and on the contrary to brighten on the rump, and on the outer edge of the wing-quills; the largeſt of theſe are tipt with brown; the two interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ones of the tail are of an olive green, and alſo the whole of the under-part of the body; and the ten lateral ones are black, tipt with yellow.</p>

                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:1084500103:373"/>
The female has neither the black breaſt-piece nor the black cords. Its throat is gray; its breaſt and belly of a greeniſh yellow, and all the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-ſide of the body of the ſame colour, but deeper. In general, the female differs little from the bird figured <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> No. 358, under the name of the <hi>Orange-bellied Blackbird of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal.</hi>

                  <p>Briſſon has ſuppoſed that this bird is a native of the Cape of Good Hope; and indeed it was brought from that place by the Abbé de la Caille. But if we believe Edwards, it belongs to a more diſtant climate, that of the iſland of Ceylon. That naturaliſt obtained accurate information on this ſubject from John Gideon Loten, who had been governor of Ceylon, and who, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from India, preſented ſeveral birds of that country to the Royal Society, and among the reſt a Ceylon Thruſh. Edwards introduces here an obſervation which we have already anticipated, but which it may not be improper to repeat. The Cape of Good Hope is the general rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of ſhips trading to the Eaſt, and it may often happen, that in touching there, birds may be left which afterwards are miſtaken for natives of the extremity of Africa,</p>

                  <p>The principal colours of this new ſpecies are green and orange; a fine deep green, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions which are variouſly ſhaded with yellow, is ſpread over the whole of the upper-part of the body, including the tail, the wings, the head, and even the throat, but is not ſo deep on the tail. The under-part of the body, from the throat downwards, is of a ſhining orange. When the wings are cloſed, there appears a train of white which belongs to the outer edge of ſome of the quills. The bill is brown, and alſo the legs.—This bird is ſmaller than the Blackbird; its length is about eight inches; its alar extent eleven and a half; its tail two and three-quarters, and its bill eleven or twelve lines.</p>

                  <p>The name Cinereous Blackbird gives a very juſt idea of the predominant colour of the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: but the intenſity is not every where the ſame: it is very deep, almoſt black, with a ſlight tinge of green on the long and narrow feathers that cover the head: it is lighter without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other tinge on the quills of the tail and of the wings, and on the great coverts of the latter. It has an olive caſt on the upper-part of the body, on the ſmall coverts of the wings, on the neck, on the throat, and on the breaſt. Laſtly, it is lighter under the body, and about the lower belly, and there is a ſlight tinge of yellow.</p>
                  <p>This Blackbird is nearly as large as our Red-Wing, but its tail is rather longer, its wings ſomewhat ſhorter, and its legs much ſhorter. Its bill is yellow, as in our Blackbirds, marked near the end with a brown ray, and furniſhed with ſome briſtles round the baſe; its tail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of twelve equal quills, and its legs are of a brown colour.</p>

The great coverts of the wings, as well as the quills, are of a blackiſh brown, edged with light gray, and ſeparated from the ſmall coverts by an olive-yellow line belonging to theſe ſmall coverts. The ſame olive-yellow predominates on the rump, and on all the under-part of the body; but under the body it is variegated with ſome black ſpots, which are pretty broad, and ſcattered thinly over the whole ſpace between the black piece of the throat and the legs.

                  <p>The <hi>Tanombé</hi> is rather ſmaller than the Red-Wing; its plumage is in general of a very deep brown on the head, neck, and all the upper-part of the body; but the coverts of the tail and wings have a tinge of green.

green at the tips of the great quills, a colour of poliſhed ſteel on the middle quills and the great coverts, and an oblong mark of fine gold-yellow on the ſame middle quills. The breaſt is of a rufous brown, the reſt of the under-part of the body white; the bill and legs are black, and the tarſus very ſhort. The tail is ſomewhat forked; the wings reach only to the middle, but its alar extent is greater in proportion than in the Red-Wing. I may obſerve, that in a ſubject which I had occaſion to ſee, the bill was more hooked at the point than repreſented in the figure, and in this reſpect the Tanombé ſeems to reſemble the Solitary Blackbird.</p>

The wings have a white bar near their outer margin, and the reſt of the under-part of the body is white.</p>

This bird exceeds not ſeven inches in length, and its wings reach only the middle of the tail, which is ſomewhat tapered.—It is a new ſpecies, introduced by Sonnerat.</p>
                  <p>Daubenton the younger has obſerved another individual of the ſame kind, in which the ends of the long quills of the wings and of the tail are of a deep varying green, with ſeveral ſpots of wavy-violet on the body, but chiefly behind the head. It is perhaps a female, or elſe a young male.</p>

                  <p>Though at firſt ſight this bird ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble moſt in its plumage that of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing article, the <hi>Brunet,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Yellow-rumped Blackbird of Senegal,</hi> which I conſider as a variety of the ſame ſpecies, we ſtill perceive obvious differences in its colour, and more important ones in the proportions of its limbs. It is not ſo large as the Red-Wing; its total length nine inches, its alar extent nine and a half, its tail three and two-thirds, its bill thirteen lines, and its leg fourteen. Its wings, therefore, ſpread leſs than thoſe of the Brunet, but its bill, tail, and legs, are proportionably longer. Its tail is alſo of a different form, and conſiſts of twelve tapered quills; each wing has nineteen, of which the longeſt are the fifth and the ſixth.</p>
                  <p>With regard to its plumage, it reſembles that bird in the brown colour of the upper-part of its body, but it differs by the colour of its helmet, which is of a ſhining black; by the rufous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of its rump, and of the upper-coverts of its tail; by the ruſty caſt of its throat, and of the whole of the under-part of its body, as far as

But having occaſion afterwards to obſerve that, among a great number of birds ſent by Sonnerat, many marked "Cape Blackbirds" were exactly like the ſubject deſcribed by Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not one with a black head and throat, it ſeems more probable that the bird, No. 317, is only a variety derived from climate.

The upper-part of the body, the neck, the head, and the tail, are black, the rump cinereous, and the three lateral feathers on each ſide tipt with white. The ſame white prevails on all the under-part of the body and of the tail, on the fore-ſide of the neck, and of the throat, and extends both ways over the eyes; but on each ſide a ſmall black ſtreak riſes at the baſe of the bill, and ſeems to paſs under the eye, and extend beyond it. The great quills of the wings are blackiſh, edged half-way with white on the inſide; the middle quills, and alſo the great coverts, are likewiſe edged with white, but on the outſide, and through their whole length.</p>
                  <p>This bird is rather larger than the Lark; its alar extent is ten inches and a half, and its wings extend a little beyond the middle of its tail. Its length, from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, is ſix inches and a half, and to the end of the nails five and a half; the tail is two and a half, the bill eight lines and a half, the leg nine, and the middle toe ſeven.</p>

                  <p>This ſpecies, which is an inhabitant of the ancient continent, retains in part the plumage of our Blackbirds. Its bill, legs, and nails, are blackiſh; it has a ſort of collar of fine velvet black, which paſſes under the throat, and extends only a little beyond the eyes; the quills of the tail and of the wings, and the plumage of the reſt of the body, are always black, but edged with lemon colour, as they are edged with gray in the Ring Ouzel; ſo that the ſhape of each feather is beautifully defined on the contiguous feathers which it covers.</p>
                  <p>This bird is nearly of the ſize of the Lark; its alar extent is nine inches and a half, and its tail is ſhorter than in our Blackbirds, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the total length of the bird, which is five inches and three quarters, and alſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the length of its wings, which ſtretch almoſt to two-thirds of its tail.

                  <p>We find in this American Blackbird the ſame ground colour that predominates in the common Blackbird. It is almoſt entirely of a ſhining black, but diverſified by other tints. On the crown of the head is a yellowiſh fulvous plate; on the breaſt are two marks of the ſame colour, but of a lighter ſhade; on the rump is a ſpot of the ſame hue; on the wings is a white line that borders them from their origin to the third joint; and laſtly, under the wings is white, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails over all the lower coverts: ſo that in flying this bird diſcovers as much white as black. Its legs alſo are brown, and its bill only blackiſh; and alſo the wing-quills, and all thoſe of the tail, except the two firſt and the laſt, which are a yellowiſh fulvous colour at their origin, but only in the inſide.</p>
                  <p>The Surinam Blackbird is not larger than a Lark; its whole length is ſix inches and a half; its alar extent nine and a half; its tail three nearly; its bill eight lines, and its legs ſeven or eight; laſtly, its wings ſtretch beyond the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of its tail.</p>

                  <p>This bird owes its name to its habits of lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and neſtling in palm-trees, where it no doubt gathers its food.

                  <p>What ſtrikes us firſt in the plumage is a ſort of large black cap, which deſcends both ways lower than the ears, and is marked on each ſide with three white ſpots, the one near the forehead, the other above the eye, and the third below it.

               <head>The GRISIN of Cayenne.</head>
               <p>THE top of the head is blackiſh, the throat black; and this black colour extends from the eyes as far as the lower-part of the breaſt: it has a ſort of white eye-brows, which appear diſtinct on the duſky ground, and connect the eyes by a white line, which borders the baſe of the upper mandible. All the upper-part of the body is cinereous gray; the tail is deeper, and terminated with white; its lower coverts and the belly are alſo white; the coverts of the wings are blackiſh, and their limits accurately defined by a white border. The quills of the wings are edged without with light gray, and tipt with white; the bill is black, and the legs cinereous.</p>
               <p>This bird is not larger than a Pettychaps; its length is about four inches and a half, its bill ſeven lines, its legs the ſame, and its wings reach to the middle of its tail, which is rather tapered.</p>
               <p>In the female, the upper-part of the body is more cinereous than in the male; what is black in the latter is only blackiſh in the former, and for that reaſon the edge of the coverts of the wings is not ſo perceptible on the ground colour.</p>

               <p>THE name of this bird ſufficiently marks its predominant colour. The green is ſhaded with a tinge of blue on the tail, on the outer edge of the great quills of the wings, and on the ſmall coverts near the back. The throat is velvet black, except the two ſmall blue ſpots which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on both ſides of the lower mandible. This black extends behind the corners of the mouth, and riſes on the upper mandible, where it occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the ſpace between its baſe and the eye, and below it is ſurrounded by a ſort of yellow high cape that falls on the breaſt; the belly is green, the bill black, and the legs blackiſh. This bird is nearly of the ſize of the Goldfinch. I could not meaſure its length, becauſe the tail was not fully grown when the bird was killed.</p>
               <p>The bill is ten lines in length, and appears ſhaped like that of the Blackbirds, its edges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcalloped near the point. This little Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird is certainly a native of Cochin China, for it was found in the ſame box with the Muſk Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, ſent directly from that country.</p>

               <p>THIS bird is undoubtedly not a Blackbird, for it has neither the appearance nor the ſhape of one. However, there is ſome reſemblance in the form of the bill, the legs, &amp;c. It has been called the <hi>Guiana Blackbird.</hi> I wait till travellers, ardent in the purſuit of Natural Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, make us acquainted with its true name, and, above all, with its habits. To judge from the little that is known of it, that is, from its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearance, I ſhould range it between the Jays and the Blackbirds.</p>
               <p>Three broad bars of fine velvet black, parted by two bars of orange-yellow, cover entirely the upper-part and the ſides of the head and of the neck. The throat is pure yellow, the breaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corated with a large blue plate; all the reſt of the lower-part of the body, including the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior coverts of the tail, is radiated tranſverſely with theſe two laſt colours, and the blue appears alone on the quills of the tail, which are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered. The upper-part of the body from the origin of the neck, and the neareſt coverts of the wings, are of a reddiſh brown; the moſt remote coverts are black, as are alſo the wing-quills: but ſome of the firſt have beſides a white ſpot, whence riſes a ſtripe of the ſame colour,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1084500103:411"/>
deeply indented, and which runs almoſt parallel to the margin of the cloſed wing. The bill and legs are brown.</p>
               <p>This bird is rather larger than a Blackbird; its whole length is eight inches and a half, its tail is two and a half, its bill twelve lines, and its legs eighteen. The wings, when cloſed, reach almoſt to the middle of the tail.</p>

               <p>NATURE has eſtabliſhed important diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between theſe birds and the Black-birds; and I therefore do not heſitate to range them ſeparately. The ſhortneſs of the tail, the thickneſs of the bill, and the length of the legs, are characteriſtic features; and theſe muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve other differences in their port, their habits, and perhaps in their diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>We are acquainted with only four birds of this ſpecies; I ſay ſpecies, for the reſemblance in the plumage is ſo exact, that they muſt be regarded as varieties only of a common ſtem. In all of them the neck, the head, the tail, are black or partly black; the upper-part of the body is green of various intenſity; the ſuperior coverts of the wings and tail are of a fine beryl colour, with a white or whitiſh ſpot on the great quills of the wing; laſtly, in all, except that of the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, the lower part of the body is yellow.</p>

Its head and neck are covered with a ſort of cowl entirely black, the tail of the ſame colour; the under-part of the body, including the coverts and the ſmall quills of the wings neareſt the back, of a deep green; the breaſt and the top of

the belly of a lighter green; the lower belly and the coverts of the tail of a roſe colour; the great quills of the wings black at their origin and at their extremity, and marked with a white ſpot between the two; the bill yellowiſh brown, and the legs orange.</p>
               <p>The whole length of the bird is only ſix inches and a quarter, becauſe of its ſhort tail; but it is more than eight inches, when meaſured from the point of its bill to the end of its feet.

               <p>THERE are two ſpecimens of this ſpecies in the Royal Cabinet. In both, the upper-part of the body is of a light ſilver-gray, the tail and wings darker, each eye encircled by a bit of ſkin entirely bare, and forming an irregular ellipſe, inclined on its ſide, the eye being the inner focus: laſtly, on the crown of the head is a line of blackiſh feathers, which runs between theſe two ſkins; but one of theſe birds is much larger than the other. The largeſt is nearly of the bulk of the common Blackbird; the under-part of its body is brown, varied with ſome white ſpots, the naked ſkin which ſurrounds the eyes fleſh-coloured, the bill, the legs, and the nails, black. In the ſmaller, the under-part of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1084500103:421"/>
the body is of a yellowiſh brown; the bald parts of the head yellow, and alſo the legs, the nails, and the anterior part of the bill. Poivre informs us, that this naked ſkin, ſometimes yellow, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fleſh-coloured, which ſurrounds the eyes, is painted with a bright orange when the bird is angry; and this muſt probably happen likewiſe in the ſpring, when the bird burns with a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as impetuous but more gentle. I retain the name of <hi>Goulin,</hi> which it receives in the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, becauſe it is diſtinguiſhed from the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird not only by the bald part on its head, but by the ſhape and thickneſs of its bill.</p>
               <p>Sonnerat has brought from the Philippines a bald bird, which reſembles much the one figured No. 200, <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> but differs in the ſize and plumage. It is near a foot in length; the two bits of naked ſkin which encircle the eyes are fleſh-coloured, and parted from the crown of the head by a line of black feathers, which runs between them. All the other feathers which ſurround this naked ſkin are alſo of fine black; and ſo is the under-part of the body, the wings, and the tail: the upper-part of the body is gray, but this colour is lighter on the rump and neck, deeper on the back and the loins. The bill is blackiſh; the wings very ſhort, and ſcarcely extend beyond the origin of the tail. If the two bald Blackbirds in the Royal Cabinet belong to the ſame ſpecies, we muſt regard the larger as a young ſubject, which had not attained its full

               <p>THIS bird feeds upon inſects, and the havoc which it makes is the more conſiderable, as it has a gluttonous appetite: the various ſorts of flies and caterpillars are its prey. Like the Carrion Crows and Magpies, it hovers about the horſes, the oxen, and the hogs, in ſearch of the vermin which often torment theſe animals to ſuch a degree as to exhauſt them, and even oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion death. The patient Quadrupedes are glad to get rid of theſe, and ſuffer, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, often ten or twelve Paradiſe Grakles to perch on their back at once: but the intruders are not content with this indulgence; the ſkin need not be laid bare by ſome wound; the birds will peck with their bill into the raw fleſh, and do more injury than the vermin which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. They may indeed be conſidered as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous birds, whoſe prudence directs them to attack openly none but the weak and the feeble. A young one was known to ſeize a rat two inches long, excluſive of the tail, daſh it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly againſt the board of its cage, break the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:1084500103:424"/>
bones, and reduce every limb to a pliancy ſuited to its views; and then lay hold of it by the head, and almoſt in an inſtant ſwallow it entire. It reſted about a quarter of an hour to digeſt it, its wings drooping, and its air languid; but, after that interval, it ran with its uſual cheerfulneſs, and about an hour afterwards, having found an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other rat, it ſwallowed that as it did the firſt, and with as little inconvenience.</p>
               <p>This bird is alſo very fond of graſshoppers; and as it deſtroys immenſe quantities, it is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable gueſt in countries curſed with theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and it merits to have its hiſtory interwoven with that of man. It is found in India and the Philippines, and probably in the intermediate iſlands; but it has long been unknown in that of Bourbon. Not above twenty years ago, Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forges-Boucher, Governor-general, and Poivre, the Intendant, perceiving this iſland deſolated by graſshoppers<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe graſshoppers had been introduced from Madagaſcar, their eggs being conveyed in the ſoil with ſome plants.</note>, deliberated ſeriouſly about the means of extirpating theſe inſects; and for that purpoſe brought ſeveral pairs of Paradiſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles from India, with the view to multiply them, and oppoſe them as auxiliaries to their formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enemies. This plan promiſed to ſucceed; when unfortunately ſome of the coloniſts, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing theſe birds eagerly boring in the new-ſown fields, fancied that they were ſearching for grain,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:1084500103:425"/>
were inſtantly alarmed, and reported through the whole iſland that the Paradiſe Grakle was pernicious. The cauſe was conſidered in form: in defence of the birds it was urged, that they raked in new-ploughed grounds, not for the grain, but on account of the inſects, and were ſo far beneficial. However, they were proſcribed by the council, and two hours after the ſentence was paſſed, not one was to be found in the iſland. This prompt execution was followed by a ſpeedy repentance. The graſshoppers gained an aſcendency, and the people, who only view the preſent, regretted the loſs of the Paradiſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles. De Morave, conſulting the inclinations of the ſettlers, procured four of theſe birds eight years after their proſcription. They were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with tranſports of joy. Their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and breeding were made a ſtate affair; the laws held out to them protection, and the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians on their part declared that their fleſh was unwholeſome. After ſo many and ſo powerful expedients, the deſired effect was produced; the Paradiſe Grakles multiplied, and the graſshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were entirely extirpated. But an oppoſite inconvenience has ariſen; the birds, ſupported no longer by inſects, have had recourſe to fruits, and have fed on the mulberries, grapes, and dates. They have even ſcraped up the grains of wheat, rice, maize, and beans; they have rifled the pigeon-houſes, and preyed on the young; and thus, after freeing the ſettlers from the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1084500103:426"/>
graſshoppers, they have themſelves become a more dreadful ſcourge<note n="*" place="bottom">They are ſtill more pernicious, as they devour the uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, particularly that called the <hi>Little Lion,</hi> which preys upon the woolly lice that ſo much injure the coffee-ſhrubs.</note>. Their rapid multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication renders it difficult to ſtop their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; unleſs perhaps a body of more powerful rapacious birds were employed againſt them; a plan which would ſoon be attended with other difficulties. The great ſecret would be to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a certain number of Paradiſe Grakles, and, at the ſame time, to contrive to reſtrain their farther multiplication. Perhaps an attentive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the nature and inſtincts of graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, would ſuggeſt a method of getting rid of them, without having recourſe to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive auxiliaries.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are not timorous, and are little diſturbed by the report of a muſket. They commonly take poſſeſſion of certain trees, or even certain rows of trees, often very near ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, to paſs the night. They alight in an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch immenſe bodies, that the branches are entirely covered with them, and the leaves concealed. When thus aſſembled, they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to chatter together, and their noiſy ſociety is exceedingly troubleſome to their neighbours. Yet their natural ſong is pleaſant, varied, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive. In the morning they diſperſe into the fields, either in ſmall flocks, or in pairs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:1084500103:427"/>
They have two hatches in ſucceſſion every year, the firſt being in the middle of ſpring. Theſe turn out well, unleſs the ſeaſon be rainy. Their neſts are very rude, and they take no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to prevent the wet from penetrating. They faſten them in the leaves of the palm or other trees, and whenever an opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, they prefer a hay-loft. Theſe birds are warmly attached to their young. When their neſts are about to be robbed, they flutter round, and utter a ſort of croaking, which indicates their rage, and dart upon the plunderer. Nor do their fruitleſs exertions extinguiſh their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; they follow their brood, which, if ſet in a window or open place, the parents will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupply with food; nor will they in the leaſt be deterred by anxiety for their own ſafety.</p>
               <p>The young Paradiſe Grakles are quickly train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eaſily learn to prattle. If kept in the poultry-yard, they ſpontaneouſly mimic the cries of all the domeſtic animals, hens, cocks, geeſe, dogs, ſheep, &amp;c. and their chattering is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with certain accents and geſtures, which are full of prettineſſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds are rather larger than the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds; their bill and legs are yellow as in theſe, but longer, and the tail ſhorter. The head and neck are blackiſh; behind the eye is a naked reddiſh ſkin, of a triangular ſhape, the lower-part of the breaſt, and all the upper-part of the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:1084500103:428"/>
body, including the coverts of the wings and of the tail, of a cheſnut brown; the belly white, the twelve quills of the tail, and the middle quills of the wings brown; the large ones blackiſh, from the tip to the middle, and thence to their origin white; which produces an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſpot of that colour near the edge of each wing when it is cloſed; and in this ſituation the wings extend to two-thirds of the tail.</p>
               <p>It is ſcarcely poſſible to diſtinguiſh the female from the male, by the external appearance<note n="*" place="bottom">The principal facts in the hiſtory of this bird were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by M. M. Sonnerat and De la Nux, correſpondents of the Cabinet of Natural Hiſtory.</note>.</p>

               <p>THIS bird is diſtinguiſhed from all others by the ſmall red appendices which terminate moſt of the middle quills of the wings; theſe appendices are nothing but the projection of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1084500103:431"/>
the ſhafts beyond the webs, which as they ſpread extend into the ſhape of a pallet, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a red colour. Sometimes as many have been reckoned as eight appendices on each ſide; ſome aſſert that the males have ſeven, and the females five; others that the females have none at all<note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards.</note>. For my own part, I have ſeen ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens which had ſeven in the one wing and five in the other; others which had only three; and others which had none; and at the ſame time exhibited other differences in the plumage. Laſtly, I have obſerved theſe appendices ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times parted longitudinally into two branches nearly equal, inſtead of forming as uſual the little pallets of a ſingle piece.</p>
               <p>Linnaeus has, with great propriety, ſeparated this bird from the Thruſhes and Blackbirds; obſerving, beſides the ſmall red appendices which diſtinguiſh it, that its proportions are different, its bill ſhorter, more hooked, and armed with a double tooth or ſcallop, which appears near the ends of both mandibles<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Liſter aſſerts that he obſerved, in one of theſe birds, that the edges of the upper mandible were not notched near the tip; this may be regarded as an individual variety: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark corrected a miſtake of the Doctor's, who had, like Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus<note n="‡" place="bottom">In the <bibl>

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:1084500103:432"/>
and is by no means carnivorous. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a conſiderable reſemblance between theſe and the Shrikes and Red-Backs, in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the colours, particularly on the head, in the ſhape of the bill, &amp;c.; but the difference of inſtinct is more important, and ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their aſſociation.</p>
               <p>It is not eaſy to determine the native climate of this bird. We ſhould be much deceived, if from the names of Bohemian Jay, Bohemian Chatterer, &amp;c. we inferred with Geſner, Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and others, that Bohemia is its principal abode. It only migrates thither, as into many other countries<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>. In Auſtria, it is conceived to be a native of Bohemia and of Stiria, becauſe it enters by the frontiers of theſe regions; but in Bohemia it might be called the bird of Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, and in Saxony the bird of Denmark, or of other countries on the ſhores of the Baltic. The Engliſh trades aſſured Dr. Liſter, that for near a century paſt the Chatterers were very common in Pruſſia. Rzaczynſki tells us, that they viſit Great and Little Poland and Lithuania. Reau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur was informed from Dreſden, that they breed in the neighbourhood of Peterſburg. Linnaeus mentions, ſeemingly on good authority, that they ſpend the ſummer, and conſequently breed, in the countries beyond Sweden; but his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents did not communicate the detail of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:1084500103:433"/>
circumſtances. Laſtly, Strahlemberg told Friſch that they are found in Tartary in the holes of the rocks, and no doubt they muſt build their neſts in theſe. But whatever be the country which the Chatterers chooſe for their reſidence, where they enjoy the ſweets of exiſtence, and tranſmit them to new generations, it is certain that they are not ſedentary, but make their excurſions over all Europe. They ſometimes appear in the North of England<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſubject figured and deſcribed in the Britiſh Zoology was killed on Flamborough-Moor, Yorkſhire.

               <p>The migrations of the Chatterers are in every country pretty regular with regard to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but if theſe be annual, as Aldrovandus was told, the birds by no means purſue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly

                  </note> from the mountains of Bohemia and Stiria, into Auſtria, in the beginning of the autumn; that it returns about the end of that ſeaſon; and that, even in Bohemia, not one is ſeen during the winter. However, it is ſaid, in Sileſia, the winter is the time when theſe birds are found on mountains. Thoſe which have ſtrayed into France and England appeared in the depth of the winter, but always in ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: a circumſtance which would ſhew that they were parted from the great body by ſome accident, and too much fatigued, or too young to recover their route. We might alſo infer, that France, England, and even Sweden, are not ſituated in the courſe of the principal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration; but we cannot draw the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion with regard to Italy, for immenſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of theſe birds have there been ſeveral times obſerved to arrive. This was particularly the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1084500103:435"/>
caſe in 1571, in the month of December; at that time it was not uncommon to ſee flocks of an hundred or more, and forty were often caught at once. The ſame event took place in February 1530<note n="*" place="bottom">As Italy is warmer than Germany, they might appear there later, and I doubt not but in more northern countries they remain a great part of the winter in years when it is not rigorous.</note>, when Charles V. cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be crowned at Bologna; for in countries where theſe birds appear at diſtant intervals, their viſits form an epoch in political hiſtory, eſpecially ſince when they are very numerous, they announce to the frightened imaginations of the people war and peſtilence. From theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities we muſt, however, except that of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes; for in 1551, when the Charterers again appeared, it was obſerved that they ſpread through Modena, Placentia, and almoſt all parts of Italy<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>, but conſtantly avoided Ferrara, as if they had a <hi>preſentiment</hi> of the earthquake which happened ſoon after, and diſperſed even the birds of that country.</p>
               <p>We cannot well aſſign the cauſe that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines theſe birds to leave their ordinary reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to roam into diſtant climes. It is not exceſſive cold; for they are embodied for their expedition as early as the beginning of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; and beſides, their migration is only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional, happening once in three or four years, or only after ſix or ſeven years, and their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1084500103:436"/>
hoſt often darkens the heavens<note n="*" place="bottom">Geſner.</note>. Are we to aſcribe theſe migrations to their prodigious multiplication; like the locuſts, and thoſe rats of the north called <hi>lemings</hi>; and, as has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the human ſpecies, when they were leſs civilized, and conſequently ſtronger, and more independent of the equilibrium which at length eſtabliſhes itſelf between all the powers of nature? Or are the Chatterers compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led repeatedly by local ſcarcity to quit their abodes, and ſeek ſubſiſtence in other climates? It is ſaid that they penetrate far into the arctic regions; and this is confirmed by Count Strah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenberg, who, as we have already noticed, ſaw them in Tartary.</p>
               <p>When the Chatterer reſides in wine countries, it ſeems fondeſt of grapes; whence Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus calls it <hi>Ampelis,</hi> or <hi>Vine Bird.</hi> Next to theſe, it feeds upon the berries of privet, of bramble, of juniper, of laurel; upon almonds, apples, ſorbs, wild gooſeberries, figs, and, in general, upon melting juicy fruits. The one which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus kept near three months, would not eat ivy-berries or raw fleſh till driven to extremity, and never touched grain. That which they tried to breed in the <hi>menagerie</hi> at Vienna was fed upon crumbs of white bread, maſhed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots, bruiſed hemp-ſeed, and juniper berries,

               <p>Theſe birds are entirely of a ſocial diſpoſition; they commonly fly in flocks, and ſometimes form immenſe bodies. Beſide this general ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable turn, and independent of their attachment to the females, they are ſuſceptible of particular friendſhips to individuals of the ſame ſex. But their affectionate temper, which implies more gentleneſs than activity, more ſecurity than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, more ſimplicity than prudence, more ſenſibility than vigour, precipitates them oftener into danger than ſuch as are more ſelfiſh. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, theſe birds are reckoned the moſt ſtupid, and they are caught in the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They are generally taken with the Thruſh, which migrates about the ſame time, and their fleſh has nearly the ſame taſte<note n="‡" place="bottom">Geſner tells us that their fleſh is very delicate, ſerved up at the beſt tables, and the liver eſpecially highly valued. The Prince d'Averſperg aſſures us, that it is better taſted than that of the Thruſh and Blackbird. On the other hand, Schwenckfeld ſays that it is very indifferent eating, and unwholeſome.

               <p>They utter their cry as they riſe from the ground; this is <hi>zi, zi, ri,</hi> according to Friſch, and all thoſe who have ſeen them alive; it is rather a chirrup than a ſong, and hence their name of <hi>Chatterer.</hi> Reaumur will not even admit that they can chant; but Prince d'Averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perg ſays that their notes are very pleaſant. Perhaps, in countries where they breed, they may warble in the ſeaſon of love, while they only chirp or chatter in other places; and when confined in cages they may be totally ſilent.</p>
               <p>The plumage is agreeable when the bird is ſtill; but when it diſplays its wings, expands its tail, and erects its creſt, in the act of flying, its appearance is charming. Its eyes, which are of a beautiful red, ſhine with uncommon luſtre in the middle of the black band, in which they are placed. This black extends under the throat, and quite round the bill; the different ſhades of wine colour on its head, back, and breaſt, and the aſh colour of the rump, are ſurrounded with a frame enamelled with white, with yellow, and with red, formed by the different ſpots of the wings and tail: the latter is cinereous at its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, blackiſh in its middle, and yellow at its
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:1084500103:439"/>
end: the quills of the wings are blackiſh, the third and fourth are marked with white near the tip, the five following marked with yellow, and moſt of theſe terminated with broad tears of a red colour, of which I have ſpoken in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this article. The bill and legs are black, and ſhorter in proportion than in the Blackbird. The total length of the bird is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Briſſon, ſeven inches and three-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, its tail two and a quarter, its bill nine lines, its legs the ſame, and its alar extent thirteen inches. For my part, I have obſerved that the dimenſions were all greater than here ſtated; owing, perhaps, to difference of age or ſex, or even between the individuals.</p>
               <p>I am not acquainted with the plumage of the young Chatterers, but Aldrovandus tells us that the margin of the tail is of a duller yellow in the females, and that the middle quills have whitiſh marks, and not yellow, as in the males. He adds a circumſtance which is hard to believe, though he aſſerts it from his own obſervation, that in the females the tail conſiſts of twelve quills, but in the males of ten only. It is much more credible that the male ſpecimens examined by Aldrovandus had loſt two of their quills<note n="*" place="bottom">Specific character of the <hi>Ampelis Garrulus:</hi>—<q rend="inline">The back of its head is creſted, the ſecondary wing-quills are membranous, and coloured at the tip.</q>

                  <p>We may obſerve that the Chatterer is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably much broader acroſs the wings than the Blackbird or Thruſhes. Aldrovandus has alſo remarked, that the <hi>ſternum</hi> is of a ſhape bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adapted for cutting the air, and accelerating its courſe. We need not then be ſurpriſed that it performs ſuch diſtant journies in Europe; and ſince it ſpends the ſummer in the countries of the north, we ſhould naturally expect to diſcover it in America. And this is actually the caſe. Reaumur received ſeveral from Canada, where they were called <hi>Recollet</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">It is the <hi>Caquantototl</hi> of Fernandez.</note>, on account of the reſemblance perceived between the creſt and a monk's frock. From Canada they could eaſily ſpread into the ſouthern colonies. Cateſby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes them among the birds of Carolina: Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez ſaw them in Mexico near Tezcuco<note n="†" place="bottom">He ſays that it delights to dwell in the mountains, that it lives on ſmall ſeeds, that its ſong is ordinary, that its fleſh is indifferent food.</note>: I have examined ſome which were ſent from Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne. This bird is not above an ounce in weight, according to Cateſby; its creſt, when erected, is pyramidal, its bill is black, with a large opening, its eyes placed on a bar of the ſame colour, ſeparated from the ground by two white ſtreaks, the extremity of the tail edged

with a ſhining white, the upper-part of the head, the throat, and the back, hazel, with a wine-tinge; the coverts and quills of the wings, the lower-part of the back, the rump, and a great part of the tail, of different ſhades of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous; the breaſt, and the inferior coverts of the tail, whitiſh; the belly and flanks of a pale yellow. It appears from this deſcription, and from the meaſures which have been taken, that the American Chatterer is rather ſmaller than the European ſort; that its wings have leſs of the enamel, and are rather of a duſkier hue; and that the wings do not extend ſo far in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the tail. But it is undoubtedly the ſame ſpecies; for ſeven or eight middle quills of its wing are terminated by the little red appendices. Brooke, ſurgeon in Maryland, told Edwards, that the females wanted theſe appendices, and that the colours of their plumage were not ſo bright as thoſe of the males. The Cayenne Chatterers which I examined had really not theſe appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and the ſhades of the plumage were in general fainter, as it commonly happens in the females.</p>

               <p>THIS bird is an inhabitant of the temperate climates, from Spain and Italy, as far as Sweden. The ſpecies, though rather ſtationary, is not numerous. It appears every year in ſome of the provinces of France, and leaves them only for a ſhort time in the ſevereſt winters<note n="†" place="bottom">It is difficult to reconcile this remark, of which I am certain, with the account given by the authors of the British Zoology, that the Groſbeak is ſeldom ſeen in England, and never except in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Perhaps, as there are few foreſts in England, there are alſo few of theſe birds, which reſide only in the woods; and as they approach the hamlets only in winter, obſervers may never have ſeen them but in that ſeaſon.</note>. It generally inhabits in the woods during the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſometimes the vineyards; and in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it reſorts near the hamlets and farms. It is a ſilent bird which is ſeldom heard, and ſeems
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:1084500103:444"/>
to have no ſong or decided warble. Nor is its organ of hearing ſo perfect as that of other birds, for though it reſides in the foreſts, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enticed by the call. Geſner, and moſt naturaliſts after him, have ſaid, that the Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beak is good eating. I have taſted the fleſh, but it ſeemed neither pleaſant nor juicy.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved in Burgundy that theſe birds are much fewer in winter than in ſummer, and that great numbers of them arrive about the 10th of April in ſmall flocks, and perch among the copſes, building their neſts<note n="*" place="bottom">A Groſbeak's neſt was found the 24th of April 1774, on a plum-tree ten or twelve feet high, in the fork of a branch; it was of a round hemiſpherical ſhape, compoſed externally with ſmall roots and ſome lichens, and internally with other ſmall roots more ſlender; it contained four eggs ſomewhat pointed, their great diameter nine or ten lines, their ſmall diameter ſix lines; they were marked with ſpots of an olive brown, and with irregular blackiſh ſtreaks faintly impreſſed on a ground of bluiſh light-green.

The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are, like thoſe of the Turtle, dry ſticks, matted with ſmall roots. They commonly lay five bluiſh eggs ſpotted with brown. We might ſuppoſe that they breed only once a-year, ſince the ſpecies is not numerous. They feed their young with inſects, chryſalids, &amp;c.; and when they are about to be robbed of their family, they make a vigorous defence, and bite fiercely. Their thick ſtrong bill enables them to crack nuts, and other hard ſubſtances; and though
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1084500103:445"/>
they are granivorous, they alſo live much upon inſects. I have kept them a long time in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries; they reject fleſh, but readily eat any thing elſe. They muſt be confined in a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cage, for without ſeeming at all diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or making the leaſt noiſe, they kill the weaker birds that are lodged with them. They attack, not by ſtriking with the point of the bill, but by biting out a morſel of the ſkin. When at liberty, they live upon all ſorts of grain, and ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of fruits; and Orioles eat the pulp of cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but the Groſbeaks break them to obtain the kernel; they feed alſo on fir and pine cones, and on beech maſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This bird is ſolitary, ſhy, and ſilent; its ear is inſenſible, and its prolific powers are inferior to thoſe of moſt other birds. It ſeems to have its qualities concentrated in itſelf, and is not ſubject to any of the varieties which almoſt all proceed from the luxuriance of nature. The male and female are of the ſame ſize, and much reſemble each other. The ſpecies is uniform in our climate; but in foreign countries there exiſt many analogous birds, which ſhall be enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the ſucceeding article<note n="*" place="bottom">The upper-mandible is cinereous, but of a lighter tint near the baſe; the lower-mandible is cinereous at the edges which cloſe into the upper; its under-ſide is fleſh-coloured, with a cinereous caſt.

               <p>THE ſpecies of the Croſsbill is cloſely related to that of the Groſbeak. Both have the ſame ſize, the ſame figure, the ſame inſtincts<note n="†" place="bottom">Friſch conceives them to be ſo nearly allied, that they would breed together.</note>. The Croſsbill is diſtinguiſhed only by a ſort of deformity in its bill, a character, or rather a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which belongs to it alone of all the winged tribe. What proves that it is a defect, an error of nature rather than a permanent feature, is, that it is variable; the bill in ſome ſubjects croſſes to the left, in others to the right; but the productions of nature are regular in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velopement, and uniform in their arrangement. I ſhould therefore impute this difference of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the way in which the bird has uſed its bill, according as it has been more accuſtomed to employ the one ſide or the other to lay hold of its food. The ſame takes place in men, who,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:1084500103:448"/>
from habit, prefer the right hand to the left<note n="*" place="bottom">This obſervation muſt be qualified. If habit were the ſole cauſe of this difference, as many people would be left-handed as right-handed. But the number of the former is very ſmall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that of the latter, and therefore the right-hand muſt by original conſtitution be ſtronger than the left, however much the difference is afterwards increaſed from habit. The ſame reaſoning ſeems applicable to the Croſsbill. T.</note>. Each mandible of the Croſsbill is affected by an exuberance of growth, ſo that in time the two points are parted aſunder, and the bird can take its food only by the ſide; and hence if it oftener uſes the left, the bill will protrude to the right, and <hi>vice verſâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But every thing has its utility, and each ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient being learns to draw advantage even from its defects. This bill, hooked upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and bent in oppoſite directions, ſeems to have been formed for the purpoſe of detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcales of fir-cones, and obtaining the ſeeds lodged beneath theſe, which are the principal food of the bird. It raiſes each ſcale with its lower mandible, and breaks it off with the upper; it may be obſerved to perform this manoeuvre in its cage. This bill alſo aſſiſts its owner in climbing, and it dextrouſly mounts from the lower to the upper bars of its cage. From its mode of ſcrambling, and the beauty of its colours, it has been called by ſome <hi>the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Parrot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:1084500103:449"/>
The Croſsbill inhabits only the cold climates, or the mountains in temperate countries. It is found in Sweden, in Poland, in Germany, in Switzerland, and among the Alps and Pyrenees. It is quite ſtationary in countries where it lives the whole year; but ſometimes it accidentally appears in large flocks in other regions. In 1756 and 1757, great numbers were ſeen in the neighbourhood of London. They do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſtated ſeaſons, but ſeem to be rather directed by chance, and many years paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their being at all obſerved. The Nut-Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſome other birds, are ſubject to the ſame irregular migrations, which occur only once in twenty or thirty years. The only cauſe which can be aſſigned is, that they have been deprived of their uſual ſubſiſtence in the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates where they inhabit, by the inclemency of the ſeaſon; or have been driven upon the coaſt by the violence of a ſtorm or hurricane: for they arrive in ſuch numbers, and appear ſo much exhauſted, that they are careleſs of their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and allow themſelves to be caught by the hand.</p>
               <p>We might preſume that the ſpecies of the Croſsbill, which prefers the cold climates, would be found in the north of the New Continent, as in that of the Old: yet no traveller to America has taken notice of it. But beſides the general preſumption which is verified by analogy, there is a fact which ſeems to prove our opinion; the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1084500103:450"/>
Croſsbill is found in Greenland, whence it was brought to Edwards by the whale-fiſhers; and that naturaliſt, who was better acquainted than any perſon with the nature of birds, remarks properly, that both the land and the water ſort which inhabit the arctic regions, appear indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in the north of America or of Europe.</p>
               <p>The Croſsbill is one of thoſe birds whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are the moſt ſubject to vary; among a great number we can ſcarcely find two indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals that are exactly ſimilar; not only are the ſhades of the plumage different, but the poſition of the colours change with the ſeaſon and the age. Edwards, who examined a prodigious number of them, and ſought to mark the limits of variation, paints the male with a roſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the female with a yellowiſh green; but in both, the bill, the eyes, the thighs, and the legs, are preciſely the ſame in regard to ſhape and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Geſner tells us that he kept one of theſe birds, which was blackiſh in September, and aſſumed a red colour in October. He adds, that the parts where the red began to appear, were the under-ſide of the neck, the breaſt, and the belly; that this red afterwards became yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that winter eſpecially is the ſeaſon when theſe changes take place, and that, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, it is ſaid they receive a red, yellow, green, and cinereous caſt. We muſt not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with our modern nomenclators, reckon as a ſeparate ſpecies, or a particular variety, a

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Friſch, who was perfectly acquainted with theſe birds, which are common in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, the colour of the adult male is reddiſh, or green mixed with red; but they loſe this red, like the Linnets, when they are kept in the cage, and only retain the green, which is more deeply impreſſed both in the young and in the old. For this reaſon they are called in ſome parts of Germany <hi>krinis</hi> or <hi>grünitz,</hi> that is, greeniſh bird. The two extreme colours have not therefore been well choſen by Edwards; we muſt not infer, as his figures would ſuggeſt, that the male is red, and the female green; there is every reaſon to believe, that in the ſame ſeaſon, and at the ſame age, the female differs from the male only in the greater faintneſs of the colours.</p>
               <p>This bird, which is ſo analogous to the Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beak, reſembles it alſo in ſtupidity. One may approach it, fire upon it without ſcaring it, and ſometimes even catch it by the hand; and as it is equally inactive and ſecure, it falls an eaſy victim to all the birds of prey. It is mute in ſummer, and its feeble notes are only heard in winter<note n="†" place="bottom">GESNER.</note>. It is quite placid in captivity, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1084500103:452"/>
lives long in a cage. It is fed with bruiſed hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and this contributes to make it ſooner loſe its red<note n="*" place="bottom">Friſch.</note>. In ſummer, its fleſh is ſaid to be good eating<note n="†" place="bottom">Geſner and Friſch.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds delight only in the dark foreſts of pines and firs, and ſeem to dread the effulgence of day. Nor do they yield to the genial influence of the ſeaſons; it is not in ſpring, but in the depth of winter, that their loves commence. They build as early as January, and their young are grown before the other birds begin to lay. They place their neſts under the large branches of the pine, fixing them with the reſin of that tree, and beſmearing them with that ſubſtance, ſo that the melted ſnow or the rains cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate. In the young, as in thoſe of other birds, the bill, or rather corners of its opening, are yellow, and they hold it always open as long as they are fed by the mother.

Found in all the northern parts of America, from Canada to the weſtern ſide of the continent. It arrives in Hudſon's Bay early in the ſpring: lodges among the pines and junipers; builds its neſt at a ſmall height from the ground; lays four eggs, which it hatches in June. Theſe birds occur alſo in the north of Europe and Aſia. They are frequent in Ruſſia and Siberia; and Mr. Pennant tells us that he ſaw them in the pine foreſts near Invercauld, Aberdeenſhire, in the month of Auguſt.</note>.</p>

This bird reſembles much the Pine Groſbeak; the ſize, and, in a great meaſure, the plumage, are the ſame; the bill is as ſtrong, the tail of the ſame length, and the climate is nearly the ſame. We might, therefore, but for the creſt, reckon it a variety of that beautiful ſpecies. The colours in the male are much brighter than in the female, whoſe plumage is not red, but only reddiſh-brown; its bill is alſo of a much fainter red, though both have the creſt. I ſhould range this bird rather with the Bulfinch and the Chaffinch, than with the Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beak, ſince it ſings agreeably; whereas the Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beak is ſilent.

This author has painted two of theſe birds, and ſuppoſes, with great probability, that <hi>Pl.</hi> 41 repreſents the male, and <hi>Pl.</hi> 42 the female.

Edwards adds lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the deſcription of this bird, though he ſaw it alive. He ſays only that it is very deſtructive among the plantations of rice; that the traders to the Eaſt-Indies call it <hi>the Javan,</hi> or <hi>Indian Sparrow</hi>; that this appellation would imply that it is found in the Eaſt-Indies, as well as in China; but he is rather diſpoſed to think that

feature, the thickneſs of its bill, and likewiſe in the ſize of its body.

                  <p>The moſt ſingular fact of the hiſtory of the Abyſſinian Groſbeak, is the conſtruction of its neſt, and the ſort of foreſight which it diſcovers, in common with the Toucnam Courvi, and the Baglafecht. The ſhape of the neſt is nearly py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidal, and the bird is always careful to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend it over the ſurface of water from the end of a ſmall branch; the entry is in the ſide, and commonly faces the eaſt; the cavity is divided by a partition into two compartments; the firſt is a kind of court into which the bird enters, then creeping along the incloſure, it deſcends into the ſecond chamber, where its eggs are laid. By means of this complex conſtruction, the eggs are ſheltered againſt the rain, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quarter the wind blows: and we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in Abyſſinia the wet ſeaſon laſts ſix months: for it is a general remark, that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and hardſhip quicken induſtry, unleſs

                  <p>There is no European ſpecies to which this foreign bird is more related than the Groſbeak. It ſhuns inhabited places, and lives retired in the unfrequented foreſts. It is languid in its amours, and deſtitute of ſong; and its only noiſe almoſt is made by the ſtrokes of its bill, in piercing the nuts to extract the kernel.—So far the analogy applies. But it differs from the Groſbeak by two remarkable properties; 1ſt, its bill is indented on the edges; and, 2dly, its feet have only three toes, two before and one

behind, which is an uncommon diſpoſition, and occurs only in a few ſpecies. Theſe two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating features ſeem to me ſo important, that the bird required an appropriated name, and I have preſerved that by which it is known in its natal region.</p>
                  <p>The head, the throat, and the fore-part of the neck, are of a fine red, which extends in a pretty narrow ſtripe under the body, as far as the lower coverts of the tail. All the reſt of the under-part of the body, the upper-part of the neck, the back, and the tail, are black; the upper-coverts of the wings brown, edged with white, the quills of the wings brown, with a greeniſh border, and the legs of a very dull red.

               <p>We ſhall alſo ſeparate from the Common or Houſe Sparrow the <hi>Field Sparrow</hi> and the <hi>Wood Sparrow</hi>; two birds more related than any of the preceding, and alſo inhabitants of our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; to each we ſhall allot a diſtinct article. This is ſurely the only way to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>Our Sparrow is too well known to need a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. It is repreſented Nos. 6 and 55. <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> fig. 1. No. 6. is the adult male after it has caſt its feathers; and fig. 1. No. 55. the young male before moulting. The change of colour in the plumage, and in the angles of the mandibles, is general and uniform; but the ſame ſpecies is ſubject to accidental varieties; for ſome Houſe Sparrows are white, others variegated with brown and white, and others almoſt entirely black<note n="*" place="bottom">Black Sparrows occur in Lorraine; but they are undoubtedly the common ſort, which as they lodge conſtantly in the glaſs-houſes, which are frequent along the foot of the mountains, are ſmoked. Dr. Lottinger, being in one of theſe glaſs-houſes, obſerved a flock of common Sparrows, among which were ſeveral black ones. An old perſon, who dwelt on the ſpot, told him, that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appeared ſo much diſguiſed, that they could not be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note>, and others yellow<note n="†" place="bottom">Aldrovandus.</note>. The only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the females and the males is,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:1084500103:478"/>
that the former are ſmaller, and their colours much fainter.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe firſt varieties, ſome of which are general and others individual, and which occur in all the European climates, there are others in more diſtant regions; which would prove that this ſpecies is ſpread from the north to the ſouth in our continent, from Sweden<note n="*" place="bottom">Linnaeus.</note> to Egypt<note n="†" place="bottom">Proſper Alpinus.</note>, Senegal, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in whatever country the Sparrow is ſettled, it never is found in deſert places, or at a diſtance from the reſidence of man. It likes neither woods nor vaſt plains. It is more frequent in towns than in villages; nor is it ſeen in the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets or farms that are buried in the depth of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. It follows ſociety to live at their expence; and indolence and voracity lead it to ſubſiſt on the proviſions of others. Our granaries, our barns, our court-yards, our pigeon-houſes, and, in ſhort, all places where grain is ſpilt, are its favourite reſort. It is extremely deſtructive; its plumage is entirely uſeleſs, its fleſh indifferent food, its notes grating to the ear, and its fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and petulance diſguſting. In ſome places Sparrows are proſcribed<note n="‡" place="bottom">In many villages of Germany, the peaſants are obliged an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to produce a certain number of Sparrows' heads. <bibl>FRISCH.</bibl>
                  </note>, and a price ſet on their heads.</p>
               <p>

But what will render them eternally trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and vexatious, is not only their exceſſive multiplication, but their ſubtlety, their cunning, and their obſtinacy to abide in places which ſuit them. They are crafty and artful, eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſnares laid for them, and wear out the patience of thoſe who try to catch them. It is only in ſeaſons of ſcarcity, and when the ſnow covers the ground, that the ſport will ſucceed; and little impreſſion can be made on a ſpecies which breeds thrice a-year. Their neſt conſiſts of hay, lined with feathers. If you deſtroy it, they will in twenty-four hours build another; if you plunder the eggs, which are five or ſix<note n="*" place="bottom">Olina ſays, that they lay ſometimes eight, and never fewer than four.</note>, often more, they will in the courſe of eight or ten days lay others; if you drive them from the trees or the houſes, they will reſort in greater numbers to your granaries. Perſons who have kept them in cages, aſſure me, that a ſingle pair of Sparrows conſume near twenty pounds of corn annually. We may judge from their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers what prodigious deſtruction they muſt make in our fields; for though they feed their young with inſects, and eat many themſelves, they principally ſubſiſt on our beſt grain. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the labourer in ſeed-time, and the reaper in harveſt. They attend the threſhers at the barns, and the poulterer when he ſcatters grain to his fowls. They viſit the pigeon-houſes, and even
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:1084500103:480"/>
pierce the craw of the young pigeons to extract the food. They eat bees, and are thus diſpoſed to deſtroy the only inſects uſeful to man. In ſhort, it is much to be wiſhed that ſome method could be deviſed for deſtroying them. I have been told, that if ſulphur were ſmoaked under the trees, where in certain ſeaſons they aſſemble and ſleep at night, they would be ſuffocated and drop dead. I have tried the experiment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, though I took much pains, and was intereſted in the iſſue; for I could not get them driven from the neighbourhood of my voleries; and I perceived that they not only diſturbed the warbling of my birds, but that by the continual repetition of their harſh cry, <hi>tui, tui,</hi> they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſpoiled the ſong of the Canaries, Siſkins, Linnets, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I then placed on a wall, covered with great Indian cheſnuts, in which the Sparrows aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in great numbers in the evening, pots filled with ſulphur, mixed with a little charcoal and roſin; and theſe ſubſtances being ſet on fire, cauſed a thick ſmoke, which had no effect but to waken the birds. As the volume aſcended, they removed to the tops of the trees, and then retired to the neighbouring houſes, but not one dropped. I obſerved only that they did not for three days viſit the trees that were ſmoaked, but afterwards returned to their former habit.</p>
               <p>As theſe birds are hardy, they can be eaſily raiſed in cages, and live ſeveral years, eſpecially
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:1084500103:481"/>
if the females be withheld from them<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">Some ſuppoſe that the male Sparrows cannot live longer than a year. The proof is, that none are obſerved to have a black beard in the ſpring, but only ſometime after, as if none had ſurvived the preceding ſeaſon. It is alleged that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are more vivacious; for they are caught along with young ones, and are diſtinguiſhed by the hardneſs of their bills.</q> 
                     <bibl>ARIST. <hi>Hiſt. Anim.</hi> lib. x. 7.</bibl>
                  </note>; for it is ſaid that their exceſſive venery abridges the period of their lives. When they are taken young, they are ſo docile as to obey the voice and catch ſomewhat of the ſong of thoſe birds with which they are bred; and being naturally familiar, they become more ſo in the ſtate of captivity. But when at liberty, they are rather ſolitary; and hence, perhaps, the origin of their name<note n="†" place="bottom">Perhaps the French word <hi>Moineau</hi> is derived from the Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </note>. Since they never leave our climate, and are always about our houſes, it is eaſy to perceive that they commonly fly ſingle or in pairs. There are, however, two ſeaſons in the year when they aſſemble, not to fly in flocks, but to chirp together, in autumn on the willows by the river ſides, and in ſpring on the firs and other evergreens. They meet in the evening, and in mild weather. They ſpend the night on the trees, but in winter they are found either alone or with their females in a hole of the wall, or beneath the tiles of roofs. And it is only in exceſſive froſts that five or ſix are found lying together, probably to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves warm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:1084500103:482"/>
The males fight obſtinately for the poſſeſſion of their females, and in the violence of their ſtruggle, they often fall to the ground. Few birds are ſo ardent, or ſo vigorous in their love. They can embrace twenty times in ſucceſſion with the ſame fire, the ſame trepidation, and the ſame expreſſions of rapture. What is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the female firſt ſhews a degree of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience at a ſport which muſt fatigue her leſs than the male, but which may alſo yield her leſs pleaſure, ſince there are no preludes, no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, no adjuſtment. Much petulance is ſhewn without tenderneſs, and a flutter of action which betrays only a ſelfiſh appetite. Compare the loves of the Pigeon with thoſe of the Sparrow, and you will perceive almoſt all the ſhades from the phyſical to the moral qualities.</p>
               <p>Theſe birds neſtle commonly under the tiles, in the lead-gutters, in holes of the wall, in pots that are erected for them, and often about the ſides of windows which have Venetian blinds. A few, however, build their neſts in trees. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome of theſe which were found in large cheſnuts and lofty willows. They place them on the ſummit of theſe trees, and conſtruct them with the ſame materials, <hi>viz.</hi> hay on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and feathers within; but what is ſingular, they add a ſort of cap above which covers the neſt, ſo as to prevent the water from penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and leave an opening for entering at under this cap. When they lodge in holes or covered
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:1084500103:483"/>
places, they judiciouſly diſpenſe with this cap. Inſtinct diſcovers here a ſort of reaſoning, and at leaſt implies a compariſon of two ſmall ideas. Some Houſe Sparrows, more indolent, though bolder than the reſt, do not give themſelves the trouble of building, but drive off the Martins, and poſſeſs their neſts. Sometimes they fight the Pigeons, and eſtabliſh themſelves in the holes.—This little tribe exhibit therefore habits and inſtincts more varied and perfect than moſt other birds. This reſults undoubtedly from their living in ſociety. They enjoy the benefits of the domeſtic ſtate without ſurrendering any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their independence. Hence that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, that circumſpection, and that accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of inſtinct to ſituations and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. <note n="A" place="bottom">Specific character of the Common or Houſe Sparrow, <hi>Fringilla Domeſtica,</hi> LINN.—<q rend="inline">The quills of its wings and tail are brown, its body gray and black, with a ſingle white ſtripe on its wings.</q> It is near ſix inches long.

                  <p>There are other foreign birds however, which, though analogous to the Houſe Sparrow, muſt be regarded as of a different ſpecies. Such is the American bird, which the inhabitants of the French Weſt-India iſlands call <hi>the Black Father, (Pere noir).</hi> It is repreſented fig. 1. No. 201. <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> It would appear to be ſettled not only in theſe iſlands, but on the continent of South America, as at Mexico; for it is mentioned by Fernandez under the Mexican name of <hi>Yohual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tototl,</hi> and deſcribed by Sir Hans Sloane as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Jamaica<note n="*" place="bottom">The Black Sparrow marked with ſaffron dots. <bibl>SLOANE.</bibl>
                     </note>. We ſuppoſe alſo that the two birds, figured No. 224. are only varieties of this. The only thing which weakens this conjecture is, that they were found in climates very diſtant from each other: 1. from Macao, the 2d from Java, and the 3d from Cayenne. I ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, however, that they are varieties of the Black Sparrow; for the climates allotted to them by the importers are not to be conſidered
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:1084500103:486"/>
as certain; and beſides, this ſpecies may occur equally in the hot countries in both conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
                  <p>There are others alſo which may be regarded as varieties of this ſpecies. The <hi>Brazil Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> of which fig. 1. No. 291. <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> is the male, and fig. 2. the female, reſembles the Black Sparrow, ſo that we cannot heſitate to aſſign it the ſame place. The reſemblance is indeed the moſt perfect in the male, for the female differs widely in its colours; but this circumſtance only apprizes us of the uncertainty of any claſſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion founded on the plumage.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is another ſpecies which we ſhould range with the Black Sparrow, but for the great difference in the length of the tail. This bird is delineated fig. 1. No. 183. <hi>Pl. Enl.</hi> under the name of the <hi>Sparrow of the kingdom of Juida.</hi> We may conſider it as a variety of the Black Sparrow, diſtinguiſhed by its long tail, which conſiſts of unequal quills. If we have been rightly informed with reſpect to the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, it would appear that the Black Sparrow is found in the Antilles, in Jamaica, in Mexico, in Cayenne, in Brazil, in the kingdom of Juida, in Abyſſinia, in Java, and as far as Macao; that is, in all the tropical countries, both of the New and of the Old Continent.</p>

long, and ſtretches two-thirds beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the wings.</p>
                  <p>This bird flies in flocks; it is familiar, and ventures to pick up grains at barn-doors.

               <p>THIS bird is undoubtedly of a different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the Houſe Sparrow. Though they inhabit the ſame climate and the ſame tracts, they never aſſociate together, and their habits are, for the moſt part, diſſimilar. The Houſe Sparrow never leaves our dwellings, but lodges and breeds in the walls and roofs. The Tree Sparrow ſeldom viſits us, lives in the fields, haunts the ſides of the roads, perches on ſhrubs and low plants, and builds its neſt in crevices and holes at a little height from the ground. It is ſaid to neſtle alſo in the woods, and in the hollows of trees; but I have never ſeen them in the woods but tranſiently, and they certainly prefer the open fields. The Houſe Sparrow flies heavily, and always to ſhort diſtances; nor can it walk without hopping and making awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward movements. The Tree Sparrow, on the contrary, whirls round more ſmartly, and walks better. This ſpecies is not ſo numerous as that
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:1084500103:490"/>
of the Houſe Sparrow; and it is exceedingly probable that they hatch only once a-year, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four or five eggs; for about the end of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they aſſemble in great bodies, and remain together during the winter. It is eaſy in that ſeaſon to catch them on the buſhes where they ſit.</p>
               <p>After this bird has alighted, it is in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual flutter, whirling, jerking its tail upwards and downwards, performing all theſe motions with tolerable grace; and hence comes its French name <hi>friquet (friſky).</hi> Though not ſo bold as the Houſe Sparrow, it does not ſhun the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of man; it often follows travellers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing any ſigns of timidity. It flies with a wheeling motion, and always very low; for it never perches on large trees, and thoſe who have called it the Cheſnut Sparrow, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded it with the Ring Sparrow, which really lodges on lofty trees and on cheſnuts.</p>

its French name. Would it not be very ſingular, that this bird, which is ſo
common in France, ſhould not at all be found in Italy, as our nomenclators
have ſtated? On the contrary, it would ſeem that there are more varieties
of this ſpecies in Italy than in France. It inhabits therefore the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

But I am ſurprized that Salerne ſhould ſay that this bird occurs not in
Germany or England, ſince the naturaliſts of theſe countries have given

               <p>The Tree Sparrow, though more reſtleſs than the Houſe Sparrow, is not ſo petulant, ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, or ſo voracious.

It avoids meeting the Houſe Sparrow, which is ſtronger and more miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It can be raiſed in a cage, and fed like a Goldfinch; it lives five or ſix years; its ſong is very poor, but quite different from the harſh cries of the Houſe Sparrow. Though more gentle than the Houſe Sparrow, it is remarked not to be ſo docile.

               <p>THE bird called the <hi>Wild Sparrow (Paſſereau Sauvage)</hi> in Provence, appears to be mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a variety of the Tree Sparrow. Its ſong, ſays M. Guys, would ſeem never to end, and is quite different from that of the Houſe Sparrow. He adds, that this bird is very ſhy, and conceals its head among the ſtones, leaving its body unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and then fancies itſelf to be ſafe. It ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the fields upon grain, and ſome years it is very rare in Provence.</p>
               <p>But beſides this and other varieties of the ſame ſort that inhabit our climates, and which we have mentioned after our nomenclators by the names of <hi>Mountain Sparrow, Collared Sparrow, Fooliſh Sparrow,</hi> there are others found in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign climates.</p>

               <p>THIS bird has, as well as the Tree Sparrow, been often confounded with the Houſe Sparrow, though it is of a different ſpecies. It is larger than either, its bill is ſtronger, and red rather than black, and it has no habit in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Houſe Sparrow. It dwells in the woods, and hence the name that it has received from moſt of the naturaliſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Paſſer Sylveſtris:</note>. It neſtles in hollow trees, lays four or five eggs, and hatches only once a-year. As ſoon as the young are able to accompany the parents, that is about the end of July, they aſſociate in flocks. The Ring Sparrows are therefore collected ſix weeks earlier than the Tree Sparrows, and form alſo more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous bodies. They remain united till the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of love, when they ſeparate with their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males in pairs. Though theſe birds are inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably ſtationary in our climate, it is probable that they dread the ſeverity of the arctic region, for Linnaeus makes no mention of them in his enumeration of the natives of Sweden.
