            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the State of</hi> RELIGION <hi>from the Revolution</hi> 1689 <hi>to the death of King George</hi> II. 1760.</head>
               <p>WILLIAM had been invited to England by a coalition of parties, united by a common ſenſe of danger; but this tie being broken, they flew aſunder, and each reſumed its original pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices. Their mutual jealouſy and rancour revived, and was heated by diſpute into intemperate zeal and enthuſiaſm. Thoſe, who at firſt acted from principles of patriotiſm, were inſenſibly warmed into partizans; and King William ſoon found himſelf at the head of a faction. As he had been bred a Calviniſt, and always expreſſed an abhorrence of ſpiritual perſecution, the Proteſtant Diſſenters conſidered him as their peculiar Protector, and entered into his intereſts with the moſt zealous fervour and aſſiduity. For the ſame reaſons, the friends of the church became jealous of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and employed all their influence, firſt in oppoſing his elevation to the throne, and afterwards in thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meaſures. William began his reign with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for confirming all Proteſtants in the offices
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0010800104:3"/>which they enjoyed on the firſt day of December. Having choſe his Council, they reſolved to convert the convention into a parliament, that the new ſettlement might be ſtrengthened by a legal ſanction, which was now ſuppoſed to be wanting, as the aſſembly had not been convoked by the King's writ of ſummons. The experiment of a new election being deemed too hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Council determined that the King, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his own authority, ſhould change the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a parliament, by going to the houſe of Peers, with the uſual ſtate of a Sovereign, and pronouncing a ſpeech from the throne to both houſes: which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient was accordingly practiſed.</p>
               <p>Whatever promiſes William had made, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſentiments of reſpect he entertained for the church of England, he ſeemed now in a great meaſure alienated from it, by the oppoſition he had met with from its members, particularly from thoſe Prelates
<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe were William Sancroft Archbiſhop of Canterbury, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Frampton Biſhop of Glouceſter, Francis Turner Biſhop of Ely, William Lloyd Biſhop of Norwich, Thomas Ken Biſhop of Bath and Wells, Thomas White Biſhop of Peterborough, John Lake Biſhop of Chicheſter, and William Thomas Biſhop of Worceſter. Among the temporal Peers, Henry Cave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>diſh Duke of Newcaſtle, Henry Hyde Earl of Clarendon, Edward-Henry Lee Earl of Litchfield, John Cecil Earl of Exeter, William Paſton Earl of Yarmouth, with the Lords Griffin and Stawel, alſo refuſed to ſwear to William and Mary.</note> who had, by abſenting themſelves from the parliament, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the oaths, plainly diſowned his title. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to mortify the church, and gratify his own friends at the ſame time, by removing the obſtacles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to non-conformity, that all Proteſtant Diſſenters ſhould be rendered capable of enjoying and exerciſing civil employments. He recommended the eſtabliſhing a new oath, in lieu of thoſe of allegiance and ſupremacy. It was propoſed to abrogate the old, and appoint new oaths, by which the ſacramental teſt was declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to render any perſon capable of enjoying
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0010800104:4"/>any office or employment. This was however reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a great majority in the houſe of Lords. Another propoſal for the ſame purpoſe, though in different terms, met with the ſame fate. Theſe fruitleſs efforts, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Diſſenters, augmented the prejudice of the churchmen againſt William, who would have willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compromiſed the difference by excuſing the clergy from the oaths, provided the Diſſenters might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from a ſacramental teſt. But this was deemed the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the propoſal was rejected. The church-party in the houſe of Lords moved, that inſtead of obliging the clergy to take the oaths, the King ſhould be empowered to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; and in caſe of their refuſal, they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the penalty, becauſe deprivation, or the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it, might make them deſperate, and excite them to form deſigns againſt the government. After a long and warm debate, all the mitigation that could be obtained, was a clauſe to inveſt the King with a power to indulge any twelve clergymen, deprived by virtue of the act, with a third part of their benefices during pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The King, though baffled in his deſign againſt the ſacramental teſt,
<note>
                     <hi>Act for tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </note> reſolved to indulge the Diſſenters with a toleration; and a bill for this purpoſe, was, after ſome debate, paſſed into a law, under the title of <hi>An act for exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Majeſties Proteſtant ſubjects diſſenting from the penalties of certain laws.</hi> It enacted, that none of the penal laws ſhould be conſtrued to extend to thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters who ſhould take the oaths to the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſubſcribe the declaration of the thirtieth year in the reign of Charles II. provided, that they ſhould hold no private aſſemblies or conventicles with the doors ſhut; and that nothing ſhould be conſtrued to exempt them from the payment of tithes or other parochial duties. That in caſe of being choſen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0010800104:5"/>into the offices of conſtables, overſeers, churchwardens, &amp;c. and of ſcrupling to take the oaths annexed to ſuch offices, they ſhould be allowed to execute the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by deputy. That the preachers and teachers in congregations of diſſenting Proteſtants, who ſhall take the oaths, ſubſcribe the declaration, together with all the articles of religion, except the thirty fourth, and the two ſucceeding articles, and part of the twentieth, ſhould be exempted from the penalties decreed againſt Non-conformiſts, as well as from ſerving upon Juries, or acting in pariſh-offices; yet all Juſtices of the Peace were empowered to require ſuch Diſſenters to ſubſcribe the declarations, and take the oaths; and in caſe of refuſal to commit them to priſon, without bail or mainprize. The ſame indulgence was extended to Anabaptiſts, and even to Quakers, on their ſolemn promiſe, before God, to be faithful to the King and Queen; and the latter's aſſenting by profeſſion and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration to thoſe articles which the others ratified upon oath: they were likewiſe required to profeſs their belief in the trinity and the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>A bill of comprehenſion had been brought into the houſe of Peers, by which moderate Diſſenters might be reconciled to the church, and admitted into eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical benefices. This was extremely agreeable to the King, who had the ſcheme of comprehenſion very much at heart. In the progreſs of the bill ſeveral warm debates aroſe, ſome of which were carried in favour of the Diſſenters: however the bill was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Commons, after it had paſſed the Lords with great difficulty. All the clamour that was raiſed againſt it could not prevent the King from proſecuting the ſcheme. He granted a commiſſion under the great ſeal to ten Biſhops, and twenty dignitaries of the church, authoriſing them to meet from time to time in the Jeruſalem-chamber, to prepare ſuch alterations of the liturgy and canons, and ſuch propoſals for the reformation of eccleſiaſtical courts, as might moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0010800104:6"/>to the good order, edification, and uniting of the church; and tend to reconcile all religious diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among the Proteſtant ſubjects of the kingdom. However, all William's endeavours at this time proved ineffectual.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1691.] The Biſhop of Ely's being accuſed of having been concerned in a conſpiracy with Lord Preſton and others, furniſhed the King with a plauſible pretence for filling up the ſees vacated by the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nonjuring Biſhops. The deprived Biſhops had been given to underſtand, that an act of parliament might be obtained to excuſe them from taking the oaths, provided they would perform their epiſcopal functions; but as they declined this expedient, the King now reſolved to ſupply their places. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he conferred the vacant ſee of Canterbury, Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, Ely, Norwich, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, Chicheſter and Worceſter, on Dr John Tillotſon, Edward Fowler, Simon Patrick, John Moore, Richard Kidder, Richard Cumberland, Robert Grove, and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Stillingfleet. Several of the inferior clergy had likewiſe ſacrificed their benefices to their ſcruples of conſcience with regard to taking the oaths, ſo contrary to thoſe they had taken to King James, and were therefore denominated <hi>Nonjurors;</hi> but theſe were but a ſmall number in proportion to thoſe who complied, though they declared that they took the oaths in no other ſenſe than that of a peaceable ſubmiſſion to the powers that were; affirming that the legiſlature had allowed the diſtinction of a King <hi>de facto</hi> and a King <hi>de jure,</hi> as they had dropped the word <hi>rightful,</hi> when the form of the oath was under debate.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1694.] This year died, on November 22, Archbiſhop Tillotſon, greatly regretted by the King and Queen; and generally lamented by the public, as a pattern of elegance, ingenuity, meekneſs, charity, and moderation. Queen Mary did not long ſurvive him:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0010800104:7"/>ſhe was taken ill of the ſmall pox, and died on De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 28, in the thirty-third year of her age, and the ſixth of her reign. She was a zealous Proteſtant, ſcrupulouſly exact in all the duties of devotion, of an even temper, and calm, mild converſation. She was ruffled by no paſſion, and ſeems to have been a ſtranger to the emotions of natural affection; for ſhe aſcended, without compunction, the throne from which her father had been depoſed, and treated her ſiſter, the Princeſs Anne, as an alien to her blood.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1698.] At this period, Dr. Thomas Bray, an active divine, formed a plan for propagating the goſpel in foreign countries. Miſſionaries, catechiſms, liturgies, and other books for the inſtruction of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, were ſent to the Engliſh colonies in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. This laudable deſign was ſupported by voluntary contribution; and the bill having been brought into the houſe of Commons for the better diſcovery of eſtates given to ſuperſtitious uſes, Dr. Bray preſented a petition, praying, that ſome part of the eſtates might be ſet apart for the propagation of the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in Maryland, Virginia, and the Leeward Iſlands. At this time likewiſe a Society for the Reformation of Manners was formed, under the King's countenance and encouragement. Conſiderable collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read prayers at certain hours in places of public worſhip, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſacrament every Sunday.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1700.] The parliament having received a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the Lancaſhire clergy, complaining of the inſolence and attempts of Popiſh prieſts, a bill was brought in, decreeing a further reward to ſuch perſons as ſhould diſcover and convict Popiſh prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; and perpetual impriſonment for thoſe convicted on the oath of one or more witneſſes. It enacted, that no perſon born after the twenty-firſt day of March next enſuing, being a Papiſt, ſhould be capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting any title of honour or eſtate within the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0010800104:8"/>kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed; and that no Papiſt ſhould be capable of purchaſing any lands, tenements or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaments, either in his own name, or in the name of other perſon in truſt for him. After ſome alterations it was ſent up to the Lords, and obtained the royal aſſent, contrary to the expectation of thoſe who proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the meaſure, on the ſuppoſition that the King was a favourer of Papiſts. However the bill was deficient in neceſſary clauſes to enforce execution; ſo that the law was very little regarded in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1701.] A bill was this year brought into the parliament for abjuring the pretended Prince of Wales (the ſon of James II. who died the ſixteenth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember at St. Germain) and ſwearing to his Majeſty by the title of rightful and lawful King, and his heirs, according to the act of ſettlement. Warm debates aroſe upon the queſtion, "Whether the oath ſhould be impoſed, or voluntary?" And, at length, it was carried for impoſition by the majority of but one voice.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1702.] King William's health had been for ſome time very much impaired, and a fall from his horſe, by which his collar-bone was fractured, probably haſtened his end. He died on March 8, in the fifty-ſecond year of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. In courage, fortitude, and equanimity, he rivalled the moſt eminent warriors of antiquity. He was religious, temperate, a ſtranger to violent paſſions, and might have paſſed for an excellent Prince, had he never aſcended the throne of Great Britain, after which he was oppoſed in the moſt generous attempts for the good of the public, and through his whole reign was the ſacrifice to the faction and parties amongſt the people he had ſaved from ruin.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1702.] Anne Princeſs of Denmark, daughter of James II. by his firſt wife, aſcended the throne upon the deceaſe of William, in the thirty-eighth year of her
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0010800104:9"/>age, to the general ſatisfaction of all parties. Even the Jacobites ſeemed pleaſed with her elevation, on the ſuppoſition that, as in all probability, ſhe would leave no heirs of her own body, the dictates of natural affection would induce her to alter the ſucceſſion in favour of her own brother. She had been taught to cheriſh warm ſentiments of the Tories, whom ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the friends of monarchy. Her inclination for them plainly appeared in her choice of miniſters; which were moſtly of that party. The Queen ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned a new parliament, which met on October 20. The Commons of this parliament had nothing more at heart than a bill againſt occaſional conformity. On November 4, a bill was brought into the houſe for that purpoſe. In the preamble all perſecution for conſcience ſake was condemned: nevertheleſs it enacted, that all thoſe who had taken the ſacrament and teſt for offices of truſt, or the magiſtracy of corporations, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards frequented any meeting of Diſſenters, ſhould be diſabled from holding their employments, pay a fine of five hundred pounds, and five pounds a day for the time in which they continued to act in their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, after having been at any ſuch meeting. But after ſeveral warm debates the bill miſcarried. A bill was brought into the lower houſe, granting another year's conſideration to thoſe who had not taken the oath of abjuration. The Lords added three clauſes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that thoſe perſons, who ſhould take the oath within the limited time, might return to their benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and employments, unleſs they ſhould be already legally filled: that any perſon endeavouring to defeat the ſucceſſion to the crown, as now limited by law, ſhould be deemed guilty of high treaſon: and that the oath of abjuration ſhould be impoſed on the ſubjects of Ireland. The Commons made ſome oppoſition to the firſt clauſe; but, at length, the queſtion being put, Whether they ſhould agree to the amendments? it was carried in the affirmative by one voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0010800104:10"/>The two houſes of convocation, which were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned with the parliament, bore a ſtrong affinity with that aſſembly, by the different intereſts which prevailed in the upper and lower. The laſt, in imitation of the Commons, was deſirous of branding the preceding reign; and it was with great difficulty that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the prelates in an addreſs of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her Majeſty. The lower houſe deſired, in an application to Thomas Teniſon Archbiſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and his ſuffragans, that the matters in diſpute concerning the manner of ſynodical proceedings, and the right of the lower houſe to hold intermediate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, might be taken into conſideration, and ſpeedily determined. The Biſhops propoſed, that, in the intervals of ſeſſions, the lower houſe might appoint committees to prepare matters; and when buſineſs ſhould be brought regularly before them, that they ſhould have ſufficient time to ſit and deliberate on the ſubject. This did not ſatisfy the lower houſe: and the prelates refuſed to depart from the Archbiſhop's right of proroguing the whole convocation, with conſent of his ſuffragans. The lower houſe propoſed to refer the controverſy to the Queen's deciſion: but the Biſhops declined this expedient, as inconſiſtent with the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authority, and the Archbiſhop's preſidency. The lower houſe, having incurred the imputation of favouring Preſbytery, by this oppoſition to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, entered in their books a declaration, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the order of Biſhops as ſuperior to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and to be a divine apoſtolical inſtitution. Then they deſired the Biſhops, in an addreſs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in ſettling the doctrine of the divine apoſtolical right of Epiſcopacy, that it might be a ſtanding rule of the church. They likewiſe preſented a petition to the Queen, complaining, that, in the convocation called in the year 1700, after an interruption of ten years, ſeveral queſtions having ariſen concerning the rights and liberties of the lower houſe, the Biſhops had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0010800104:11"/>refuſed a verbal conference; and, afterwards, declined a propoſal to ſubmit the diſpute to her Majeſty's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. They therefore fled to her Majeſty for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, begging ſhe would call the queſtion into her own royal audience. The Queen promiſed to conſider the petition, and ordered their council to examine the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, how it conſiſted with law or cuſtom. Whether their report was unfavourable to the lower houſe, or the Queen was willing to encourage the diviſion, no other anſwer was made to their addreſs. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts produced diviſions through the whole body of the clergy, who ranged themſelves in different factions, diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>High Church</hi> and <hi>Low Church.</hi> The firſt conſiſted of eccleſiaſtical Tories; and the other included thoſe who profeſſed revolution-principles, and recommended moderation towards the Diſſenters. At preſent, however, the Tories, both in church and ſtate, triumphed in the favour of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1703.] The bill againſt occaſional confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was revived this year in the houſe of Commons. In the new draught however the penalties were lowered, and the ſeveral clauſes mitigated. After ſeveral debates it paſſed; and was ſent up to the Lords. It was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by a ſmall majority of the Biſhops, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by Burnet Biſhop of Sarum, who exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as a ſcheme to ſet the church and Proteſtants at variance: and, the queſtion being put for a ſecond reading, it was carried in the negative.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1704.] On February 7, the Queen ordered Secretary Hedges to tell the houſe of Commons,
<note>
                     <hi>Firſt fruits and tenths granted to the poor clergy.</hi>
                  </note> that ſhe had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor clergy: that ſhe would grant her whole revenue ariſing out of the firſt fruits and tenths, as far as it ſhould become free from incumbrance, as an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their maintenance: and that, the houſe of Commons could find any method by which her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0010800104:12"/>to the poor clergy might be made more effectual, it would be an advantage to the public, and acceptable to her Majeſty. The Commons immediately brought in a bill, enabling her to alienate this branch of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and create a corporation by charter, to direct the application of it to the uſes propoſed: they likewiſe repealed the ſtatute of mortmain, ſo far as to allow all men to bequeathe by will, or grant by deed, any ſum they ſhould think fit to give towards the augmentation of benefices. Addreſſes of thanks, from all the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of England, were preſented to her Majeſty for her gracious bounty. But very little regard was paid to Gilbert Burnet Biſhop of Sarum, although the Queen declared that Prelate author of the project
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Charles Leſlie, in his laſt letter to Biſhop Burnet, gives the true riſe of this project in favour of the poor clergy.</note>.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1705.] Some debates having paſſed in the houſe of Lords upon the ſuppoſed dangers to which, the Tories affirmed, the church was expoſed, the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was put, Whether the church was in danger? and carried in the negative by a great majority. Then the houſe reſolved, that the church of England, as by law eſtabliſhed, which was reſcued from the extremeſt danger by King William III. of glorious memory, is now, by God's bleſſing, under the happy reign of her Majeſty, in a moſt ſafe and flouriſhing condition; and that whoever goes about to ſuggeſt or inſinuate that the church is in danger, under her Majeſty's adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an enemy to the Queen, church, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Commons concurred in this determination, and joined the Lords in an addreſs to the Queen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating this reſolution, beſeeching her to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual meaſures for making it public; and alſo for puniſhing the authors and ſpreaders of the ſeditious and ſcandalous reports of the church's being in danger. The convocation, inſtead of imitating the union and harmony of the parliament, revived the former divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0010800104:13"/>and the two houſes ſeemed to act with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined rancour againſt each other. The upper houſe having drawn up a warm addreſs to the Queen, for her affectionate care of the church, the lower houſe refuſed to concur; nor would they give any reaſon for their diſſent. They prepared another in a different ſtrain, which was rejected by the Archbiſhop. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this diſſention the addreſs was dropped, and a ſtop put to all further communication of the two houſes. The Dean of Peterborough proteſted againſt the irregularities of the lower houſe. The Queen, in a letter to the Archbiſhop, ſignified her reſolution to maintain her ſupremacy, and the due ſubordination of Preſbyters to Biſhops. She expreſſed her hope that he and his ſuffragans ſhould act conformably to her reſolution, in which caſe they might be aſſured of the continuance of her favour and protection. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to impart this declaration to the Biſhops and clergy, and to prorogue the convocation to ſuch time as ſhould appear moſt convenient. When he communicated this letter to the lower houſe, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were not a little confounded; nevertheleſs they would not comply with the prorogation, but continued to ſit in defiance of her Majeſty's pleaſure.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1706.] The union between England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which had been ſo often attempted in vain, was this year ratified by the Queen and the parliaments of both nations, though not without a ſtrong oppoſition, eſpecially on the part of the Scotch. Before the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh parliament began to inveſtigate the articles of the Union, the houſe of Lords, at the inſtance of the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, brought in a bill for the ſecurity of the church of England, to be inſerted as an eſſential and fundamental part of that treaty. It paſſed through both houſes without oppoſition, and received the royal aſſent, and the Union of the two kingdoms commenced on May 1, 1707.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0010800104:14"/>A. D. 1707.] The lower houſe of convocation ſtill continued to wrangle with their ſuperiors; and, though they joined the upper houſe in a congratulatory addreſs to the Queen, on the ſucceſs of her arms, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make application to the houſe of Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Union. The Queen, being appriſed of their deſign, deſired the Archbiſhop to prorogue them for three weeks, before the expiration whereof the act of Union had paſſed in parliament. The lower houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a repreſentation to the Biſhops, in which they affirmed, no ſuch prorogation had ever been ordered during the ſitting of parliament. The Biſhops found, in their records, ſeveral precedents of ſuch prorogations, and a great many inſtances of the convocation's having ſat ſometimes when the parliament was diſſolved. The Queen, informed of theſe proceedings, wrote a letter to the Archbiſhop, intimating that ſhe looked upon the lower houſe as guilty of an invaſion of her royal ſupremacy: and that, if any thing of the ſame nature ſhould be attempted for the future, ſhe would uſe ſuch means of puniſhing offenders as the law warranted. The Prolocutor abſenting himſelf from the convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Archbiſhop pronounced ſentence of contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy againſt him: and the lower houſe, in a proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declared this ſentence unlawful, and altogether null. Nevertheleſs, the Prolocutor made a full ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with which the Archbiſhop was ſatisfied; and the ſentence was repealed
<note n="*" place="bottom">Three Camiſars, or Proteſtants, from the Cevennois, having made their eſcape and repaired to London, acquired about this time the appellation of French Prophets, from their enthuſiaſtic geſticulations, effuſions, and convulſions; and even formed a ſect of their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The French refugees, ſcandalized at their behaviour, and authoriſed by Henry Compton, Biſhop of London, as Superior of the French congregations, reſolved to enquire into the commiſſion of theſe pretended Prophets, whoſe names were Elias Marion, John Cavallier, and Durand Fage: and they were declared impoſtors and counterfeits. Notwithſtanding this deciſion, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Biſhops, they continued their aſſemblies in Soho, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkley and John Lacy. They reviled the miniſters of the eſtabliſhed church; they denounced judgments againſt the city of London, and the whole Britiſh nation; and publiſhed their predictions, compoſed of unintelligible jargon. Then they were proſecuted at the expence of the French churches, as diſturbers of the public peace, and falſe prophets. They were ſentenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each, and ſtand twice on a ſcaffold, with papers on their breaſts denoting their offence: a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which was executed accordingly at Charing-croſs and the Royal Exchange.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0010800104:15"/>A. D. 1709.] On the 13th of December, Mr. Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben made a complaint to the houſe of Commons of two ſermons, preached, and publiſhed, by Dr. Henry Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheverel, Rector of St. Saviour's in Southwark, as containing poſitions contrary to revolution-principles, to the preſent government, and the Proteſtant ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Dolben's complaint was ſeconded by Sir Peter King and other members: and the ſermons being read, were voted ſcandalous and ſeditious libels. Sacheverel, being brought to the bar of the houſe, owned himſelf the author of both: and the Doctor being ordered to withdraw, the houſe reſolved he ſhould be impeached of high crimes and miſdemeanours, and Mr. Dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the houſe of Lords, in the name of all the Commons of England. A committee was appointed to draw up articles, and Sacheverel was taken into cuſtody. Being impeached at the bar of the upper houſe, he petitioned that he might be admitted to bail; but this indulgence was refuſed, and the Commons ſeemed bent upon proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting him with ſuch ſeverity as gave diſguſt to men of moderate principles. Mean while the Tories were not idle. They boldly affirmed that the Whigs had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deſign to pull down the church; and that this proſecution was intended to try their ſtrength, before they would proceed openly to the execution of their project. Theſe aſſertions were ſupported, and even credited by ſome part of the clergy; who did not fail to alarm and inflame their hearers; while emiſſaries were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0010800104:16"/>employed to raiſe a ferment among the populace. The articles againſt Sacheveral being exhibited
<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſubſtance of the articles againſt the Doctor was, 1. That he had ſuggeſted, and maintained, that the neceſſary means uſed to bring about the <hi>revolution</hi> were odious and unjuſtifiable. 2. That the <hi>act of toleration</hi> was unreaſonable, and the allowance of it unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable. 3. That the church of England was in a ſtate of great peril and adverſity under her Majeſty's adminiſtration. 4. That her Majeſty's adminiſtration, both in eccleſiaſtical and civil affairs, tended to the deſtruction of the conſtitution, &amp;c. Theſe articles were drawn from a ſermon the Doctor had preached at the aſſizes at Derby, on Auguſt 15, and another he had preached at St. Paul's before Sir Samuel Garrard Lord Mayor of London, on November 5, this year.</note>, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was committed to the Deputy Uſher of the Black Rod; and the Lords admitted him to bail: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed February 27 for his trial in Weſtminſter Hall.</p>
               <p>This extraordinary trial engaged the attention of the whole kingdom. It laſted three weeks, during which all other buſineſs was ſuſpended; and the Queen her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was every day preſent, though in quality of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpectator. A vaſt number of people attended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheverel every day to and from Weſtminſter Hall, ſtriving to kiſs his hand, and praying for his deliverance, as if he had been a martyr or confeſſor. The Queen's ſedan was beſet by the populace, exclaiming, "God bleſs your Majeſty and the church. We hope your Majeſty is for Dr. Sacheverel." When the Doctor's council had finiſhed his defence, he himſelf recited a ſpeech, wherein he ſolemnly juſtified his intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Queen and her government; and ſpoke in reſpectful terms of the revolution, and the Proteſtant ſucceſſion. He maintained the doctrine of non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in all caſes whatſoever, as a maxim of the church in which he was educated; and, by many pathetical expreſſions, endeavoured to excite the compaſſion of the audience. He was ſurrounded by the Queen's chaplains, who encouraged and extolled him as the champion of the church; and he was privately favoured by the Queen herſelf, who could not but reliſh a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0010800104:17"/>ſo well calculated for the ſupport of regal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. After obſtinate diſputes, and much virulent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation, Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of ſeventeen voices; but four and thirty Peers entered a proteſt againſt this deciſion
<note n="†" place="bottom">In the courſe of the trial, Thomas Earl of Wharton obſerved, that if the revolution was not lawful, many in the houſe of Peers, and many others, were guilty of blood, murder, rapine, and injuſtice; and that the Queen herſelf was no lawful Sovereign, ſince that the beſt title ſhe had to the crown was her parliamentary title founded upon the revolution. The Earl of Scarborough ſaid, that the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was a nice point, and above the law: and Hooper, Biſhop of Bath and Wells, allowed that the revolution was not to be boaſted of, nor made a precedent, and thoſe who examined it too nicely were no friends to it. The Duke of Leeds diſtinguiſhed between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and revolution; for had not the laſt ſucceeded, it would certainly have been rebellion, ſince he knew of no other but heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right. Burnet, Biſhop of Sarum, who was no friend to Sache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verel, and remarkable for an accidental abſence of mind and unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expreſſion, affirmed, that the Doctor, in reflecting upon the Queen's miniſters, had ſo well marked a Peer there preſent [the Earl of S—nd—d] by the epithet of Volpone, in one of his ſermons, that it was not poſſible to miſtake him. Some of the young Peers could not help laughing at this undeſigned ſarcaſm upon the Lord Treaſurer, and exclaimed, "Name him, name him!" but the Chancellor interrupted, declaring, that no Peer was obliged to ſay more than he ſhould think proper.</note>. He was prohibited from preaching for the term of three years: his two ſermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hangman, in preſence of the Lord Mayor, and the two Sheriffs of London and Middleſex. The lenity of the ſentence paſſed upon Sacheverel, which was in a great meaſure owing to the dread of popular reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his friends conſidered as a victory obtained over a Whig faction, and they celebrated their triumph with bonfires and illuminations.</p>
               <p>The Queen now ſo apparently favoured the Tories, that the Whig miniſtry were entirely removed, and their places ſupplied by the other party. There was not one Whig left in any office of ſtate, except the Duke of Marlborough: and he was greatly on the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0010800104:18"/>decline in the Queen's favour. That the triumph of the Tories might be more complete, her Majeſty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Whig parliament, after ſuch precautions were taken, as could not fail to influence the new election, in favour of the high-church party. To this end nothing ſo effectually contributed as did the trial of Sacheverel, who was uſed as a tool to wind and turn the paſſions of the vulgar. Having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to a benefice in North Wales, he went in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to that country with all the pomp and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of a ſovereign Prince. He was ſumptuouſly entertained by the univerſity of Oxford, and divers noblemen: and was received in ſeveral towns, by the magiſtrates of the corporation in their formalities, and often attended by a body of a thouſand horſe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was heard but the cry of "the church and Dr. Sacheverel." The clergy were actuated by a ſpirit of enthuſiaſm, which ſpread through all ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of people, and had ſuch an effect upon the elections of the new parliament, that few were returned as members but ſuch as had diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their zeal againſt the Whig adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>A. D 1711] The houſe of Commons, in order to demonſtrate their attachment to the church, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an addreſs from the lower houſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and a quickening meſſage from the Queen, paſſed a bill for building fifty new churches in the ſuburbs of London and Weſtminſter, and appropriated for this purpoſe the duty upon coals, which had been granted for the building of St. Paul's cathedral. Of the convocation, which was aſſembled with the new parliament, the lower houſe choſe Dr. Francis Atter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury for their prolocutor. He was an enterpriſing eccleſiaſtic, of extenſive learning, acute talents, violently attached to Tory principles, and intimately connected with the prime miniſter Robert Harley, lately created Earl of Oxford, and Earl Mortimer; ſo that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all the proceedings in the lower houſe of convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0010800104:19"/>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0010800104:21"/>in concert with that miniſter. The Queen, in a letter to the Archbiſhop, ſignified her hope that the conſultations of the clergy might be of uſe to redreſs the attempts of looſe and prophane perſons. She ſent a licence under the broad ſeal, empowering them to ſit and do buſineſs, in as ample a manner as ever had been granted ſince the reformation. The Biſhops were purpoſely ſlighted and overlooked, becauſe they had lived in harmony with the miniſtry. A committee being appointed to draw up a repreſentation of the preſent ſtate of the church and religion, Atterbury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the taſk, and compoſed a remonſtrance that contained the moſt keen and ſevere ſtrictures upon the adminiſtration, as it had been exerciſed ſince the time of the revolution. Another was penned by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in more moderate terms; and ſeveral regulations were made: but in none of theſe did the two houſes agree. They concurred however in cenſuring ſome tenets favouring Arianiſm, broached and ſupported by Mr. Whiſton, mathematical profeſſor at Cambridge. He had been expelled the univerſity, and wrote a vindication of himſelf, dedicated to the convocation. The Archbiſhop doubted, whether this aſſembly could proceed againſt a man for hereſy: the Judges being conſulted, the majority of them gave in their opinions, that the convocation had a juriſdiction. The Queen, in a letter to the Biſhops, ſaid, that as there was no doubt of their juriſdiction, ſhe expected they would proceed in the matter before them. Freſh ſcruples ariſing, they determined to examine the book, without proceeding againſt the author, and this was cenſured accordingly. An extract of the ſentence was ſent to the Queen; but ſhe did not ſignify her pleaſure on the ſubject, and the affair remained in ſuſpence. Whiſton publiſhed a work in four volumes, juſtifying his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and maintaining, that the apoſtolical conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were not only canonical, but alſo preferable in point of authority to the epiſtles and the goſpels. The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0010800104:22"/>bill againſt occaſional conformity was now revived in parliament by the Earl of Nottingham, in more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate terms than thoſe that had been formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and it paſſed both houſes by the connivance of the Whigs, upon the Earl's promiſe, that if they would conſent to this meaſure, he would bring over many friends to join them in matters of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1713.] In conſequence of the treaty of Utrecht, by which the French King obliged himſelf to abandon the Pretender (generally diſtinguiſhed by the name of the Chevalier de St. George, ſince 1708) and acknowledge the Queen's title and the Proteſtant ſucceſſion, the Chevalier had repaired to Lorrain. The parliament deſired that the Queen would preſs the Duke of Lorrain, and all the Princes and States in amity with her, to exclude him from their dominions. Her Majeſty taking little notice of this addreſs, the Whigs were alarmed: they concluded that the dictates of natural affection had biaſſed her in favour of the Chevalier. Whatever ſentiments of tenderneſs and compaſſion ſhe might feel for that unfortunate exile, the acknowledged ſon of her own father, it does not appear that ſhe ever thought of altering the ſucceſſion as by law eſtabliſhed. The term of Sacheverel's ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion being now expired, extraordinary rejoicings were made upon the occaſion: he was deſired to preach before the houſe of Commons, who thanked him for his ſermon; and the Queen promoted him to the rich benefice of St. Andrew's in Holborn, London.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1714.] At this period died the Princeſs Sophia, Electreſs Dowager of Hanover (daughter of Frederic King of Bohemia, and grand-daughter of James I. of England) upon whoſe heirs the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the crown of England, by the act of ſettlement, devolved, as the neareſt branch of the royal family in the Proteſtant line. She was in all reſpects one of the moſt accompliſhed Princeſſes of the age in which ſhe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0010800104:23"/>lived. The court of England went in mourning at her death; and the Elector of Brunſwic, her ſon, afterwards King of England, was prayed for by name in the liturgy of the church of England. On May 12, Sir William Wyndham made a motion for a bill to prevent the growth of ſchiſm, and for the further ſecurity of the church of England as by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. The deſign of it was to prohibit Diſſenters from teaching in ſchools and academies. It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prepared, but eagerly oppoſed in both houſes as a ſpecies of perſecution. Nevertheleſs, it made its way through both, and received the royal aſſent; but the Queen dying on the day it was to take place, the law was rendered ineffectual.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſty's conſtitution was now quite broke, one fit of ſickneſs ſucceeded another; and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind, occaſioned by the diſcontents which had been raiſed by the enemies of her government, and by the diſſentions among her miniſters. At laſt ſhe was ſeized with a lethargic diſorder, and, notwithſtanding all the medicines which the phyſicians could preſcribe, the diſtemper gained ground ſo faſt, that, on July 30, they deſpaired of her life. The council immediately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and took all the neceſſary precautions for ſecuring the peace of the kingdom. They diſpatched a meſſenger to the Elector of Brunſwic, informing him of the meaſures they had taken, and deſiring he would, with all poſſible ſpeed, repair to Holland; where he ſhould be attended by a Britiſh ſquadron to convoy him to England, in caſe of her Majeſty's deceaſe. The Queen continued to doſe in a lethargic inſenſibility, with very ſhort intervals, till Auguſt 1, in the morning, when ſhe expired, in the fiftieth year of her age, and the thirteenth of her reign. The capacity of Anne Stuart, Queen of Great Britain, was naturally good, but not much cultivated by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor did ſhe exhibit any marks of extraordinary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0010800104:24"/>genius, or perſonal ambition. She was not deficient in that firmneſs of mind by which a Prince ought to preſerve his independence, and avoid the ſnares and fetters of ſycophants and favourites: but whatever might have been her weakneſs in that particular, the virtues of her heart could not be queſtioned. She was a pattern of conjugal fidelity and affection, a warm friend, an indulgent miſtreſs, a munificent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and a merciful Princeſs, during whoſe reign no ſubject's blood was ſhed for treaſon. She was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly attached to the church of England, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction rather than from prepoſſeſſion, unaffectedly pious, juſt, charitable and compaſſionate. She felt a mother's fondneſs for her people, by whom ſhe was univerſally beloved, with a warmth of affection which even party-prejudice could not abate. In fine, if ſhe was not the greateſt, ſhe was certainly one of the beſt and moſt unblemiſhed Sovereigns that ever ſat on the throne of England; and well deſerved that expreſſive, though ſimple epithet, "The good Queen Anne."</p>
               <p>A. D. 1714.] King George I. aſcended the throne of Great Britain in the fifty-fifth year of his age, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt oppoſition, tumult, or ſign of popular diſcontent; and many were now convinced that no deſign had ever been concerted by Queen Anne and her miniſtry in favour of the Chevalier de St. George. On September 17, his Majeſty arrived in the river, and, landing at Greenwich, was received by George Fitz-Roy Duke of Northumberland, Captain of the life-guards ſoon removed and the Lords of the council. It was the misfortune of this Prince, as well as a very great prejudice to the nation, that he had imbibed a ſtrong prepoſſeſſion againſt the Tories, who conſtituted ſuch a conſiderable part of his ſubjects. They were now excluded from all ſhare of the royal favour, which was wholly engroſſed by their enemies; and theſe early marks of averſion, which he was at no
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0010800104:25"/>pains to conceal, alienated the minds of many from his perſon and government who would otherwiſe have ſerved him with fidelity and affection. The number of malecontents conſiderably increaſed by the King's attachment to the Whig faction. The clamour of the church's being in danger was revived; jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were excited, ſeditious libels diſperſed, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tumults raiſed in different parts of the country. Birmingham, Briſtol, Chippenham, Norwich, Reading, &amp;c. were filled with licentious riot. The party-cry was, "Down with the Whigs; Sacheverel for ever!" Many gentlemen of the Whig party were abuſed; magiſtrates in towns, and juſtices in the country, were reviled and inſulted by the populace in the execution of their office. Religion was ſtill mingled in all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical diſputes. The high churchmen complained, that impiety and hereſy daily gained ground, from the connivance, or at leaſt the ſupine negligence, of the Whig prelates.</p>
               <p>The lower houſe of convocation had, before the Queen's death, declared that a book publiſhed by Dr. Samuel Clarke, under the title of "The ſcripture-doctrine of the Trinity," contained aſſertions contrary to the Catholic faith. They ſent up extracts from this performance to the Biſhops; and the Doctor wrote an anſwer to their objections. He was prevailed upon to write an apology, which he preſented to the upper houſe; but, apprehending it might be publiſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately and miſunderſtood, he afterwards delivered an explanation to the Biſhop of London. This was ſatisfactory to the Biſhops; but the lower houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that it was no recantation of his heretical aſſertions. The diſputes about the Trinity increaſing, the Archbiſhops and Biſhops received directions, which were publiſhed, for preſerving unity in the church, the purity of the Chriſtian faith concerning the Holy Trinity, and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the ſtate. By theſe, every preacher was reſtricted from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0010800104:26"/>delivering any other doctrine, than what is contained in the holy ſcriptures, with reſpect to the Trinity; and from intermeddling in any affairs of ſtate or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The like prohibition was extended to thoſe who ſhould write, harangue, or diſpute, on the ſame ſubjects.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1715] The proceedings againſt the late Queen's miniſter, and partiality to the Whigs, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſpirit of diſcontent, which was ſo much fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the friends of hereditary right, both in England and Scotland, that it broke out into open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the ſuppreſſion of which proved fatal to ſome of the firſt families in both kingdoms.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1717.] The deliberations of the convocation turned chiefly upon two performances of Dr. Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Hoadly Biſhop of Bangor. One was intitled, <hi>A preſervative againſt the principles and practices of the Nonjurors.</hi> The other was a ſermon preached before the King, at the chapel royal at St. James's, on March 31, under the title <hi>Of the nature of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or church of Chriſt.</hi> An anſwer to this diſcourſe was publiſhed by Dr. Snape, Maſter of Eaton college: and the lower houſe of convocation took ſo great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and were ſo highly ſcandalized at ſome of the doctrines advanced by that prelate, in thoſe two pieces, that they unanimouſly appointed a committee of ſix of their members (Dr. Moſs, Dr. Sherlock, Dr. Friend, Dr. Sprat, Dr. Cannon, and Dr. Biſs) to examine the Biſhop's two performances. They drew up a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, in which <hi>the preſervative</hi> and <hi>the ſermon</hi> were cenſured, as "tending to ſubvert all government and diſcipline in the church of Chriſt; to reduce his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a ſtate of anarchy and confuſion; to impugn, and impeach, the royal ſupremacy in cauſes eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and the authority of the legiſlature, to inforce obedience in matters of religion by civil ſanctions." This repreſentation was not carried to the upper houſe; for the King or his miniſtry, being informed of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0010800104:27"/>matter, took care to prevent the heats and animoſities which this diſpute, if not timely checked, might have occaſioned: and therefore his Majeſty ſent a writ to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury to prorogue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. As for the conſequences it produced after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, among the contending parties, who, upon a trivial incident, in which their own reputations indeed were concerned, but the merits of the cauſe not in the leaſt affected, grew ſo outrageous, as, by advertiſement in the public news-papers, ſigned by their own hands, to give one another the lye, and thereby not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to the deriſion of the ſober part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but even the church of England to the attacks and inſults of her enemies; I have neither room nor inclination to inſert them. The Biſhop's chief antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts were Dr. Snape and Dr Sherlock, whom his Majeſty removed from the office of his chaplains. The convocation has not been permitted to ſit and do buſineſs ever ſince that period, unleſs it be to make complimentary addreſſes to the throne
<note n="*" place="bottom">In the beginning of this year, the Rev. Mr. Laurence Howel was convicted, at the Old Bailey, of writing a pamphlet, intitled, "The ſtate of ſchiſm in the church of England truly ſtated;" in which he affirmed that the eſtabliſhed church was ſchiſmatical ſince the deprivation of the primate and the other Biſhops at the revolution. He received ſentence to pay a fine of 500 l. to the King; to remain in priſon for three years; to find four ſureties of 500l. each, and to be bound himſelf in 1000l. for his good behaviour during liſe, to be twice whipped, to be degraded, and ſtripped of his gown by the common executioner.</note>.</p>
               <p>On December 13, Earl Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope declared in the houſe of Lords,
<note>
                     <hi>The acts to prevent occaſional conformity, and the growth of ſchiſm, repealed.</hi>
                  </note> that, in order to unite the hearts of the well-affected to the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, he had a bill to offer under the title of "An act for ſtrengthening the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant intereſt in theſe kingdoms." It was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly read, and appeared to be a bill repealing the acts againſt occaſional conformity, the growth of ſchiſm,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0010800104:28"/>and ſome clauſes in the corporation and teſt acts. This had been concerted by the miniſtry, in private meetings with the moſt eminent Diſſenters. The Tory Lords were aſtoniſhed at this motion, for which they were altogether unprepared: nevertheleſs they ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly oppoſed it. They alledged that the bill, inſtead of ſtrengthening the church of England, would certainly weaken her, by plucking off her beſt feathers, inveſting her enemies with power, and ſharing with churchmen the civil and military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, of which they were then wholly poſſeſſed. Earl Cowper declared himſelf againſt that part of the bill, by which ſome clauſes of the teſt acts were repealed; becauſe he looked upon thoſe acts as the main bulwark of our excellent conſtitution in church and ſtate, which ought to be inviolably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Archibald Earl of Ilay (late Duke of Argyle) oppoſed the bill, becauſe, in his opinion, it infringed the <hi>pacta conventa</hi> of the treaty of union, by which the bounds, both of the church of England and that of Scotland, were fixed and ſettled; and he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, if the articles of the union were broke with reſpect to one church, it might afterwards be a precedent to break them with reſpect to the other. William Wake Archbiſhop of Canterbury ſaid, the acts, which were by this bill to be repealed, were the main bulwark and ſupporters of the Engliſh church. He expreſſed all imaginable tenderneſs for well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcientious Diſſenters; but he could not forbear obſerving, that ſome among that ſect made a wrong uſe of the favour and indulgence ſhewn to them at the revolution, though they had the leaſt ſhare in that happy event: it was therefore thought neceſſary for the legiſlature to interpoſe, and put a ſtop to the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous practice of occaſional conformity. He added, that it would be needleſs to repeal the act againſt ſchiſm, ſince no advantage had been taken of it to the prejudice of Diſſenters. Dr. Hoadly Biſhop of Bangor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0010800104:29"/>endeavoured to prove, that the occaſional and ſchiſm acts were in effect perſecuting laws; and that, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the principle of ſelf defence and ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in matters of religion, all the perſecutions main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the heathens againſt the profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and even the Popiſh inquiſition, might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. With reſpect to the powers, of which many clergymen appeared to be ſo fond and zealous, he owned the deſire of power and riches was natural to all men; but that he had learned, both from reaſon and from the goſpel, that this muſt be kept within due bounds, and not intrench upon the rights and liberties of their fellow creatures and countrymen. After a long debate, the houſe agreed to leave out ſome clauſes, concerning the teſt and corporation acts: then the bill was committed, and afterwards paſſed. It met with great oppoſition in the lower houſe, but was carried by the majority.</p>
               <p>While the bill was depending, a clauſe was propoſed, whereby all perſons, who came to qualify themſelves for offices, were obliged to acknowledge the holy ſcriptures to be a divine inſpiration, and their faith in the holy Trinity; but was rejected as too great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
               <p>On November 27, the Rev. Mr. Edward Byſſe, Rector of Portbury, and of St. George, in Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, was brought to the court of King's-Bench, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, to receive the judgment of that court for the ſeveral facts of which he had been convicted; viz. at the aſſizes at Saliſbury, in Wiltſhire, July 25, for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Abury, in that county, the following words: "George has no buſineſs here: we have had no laws theſe thirty years, never ſince the time of King James II. nor ſhall until King James comes; he is my maſter, and my rightful King." At the aſſizes at Ayleſbury, in the county of Buckingham, July 28, he was convicted for ſpeaking the ſame words at Slough
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0010800104:30"/>in that county. At the aſſizes at Wells, in the county of Somerſet, Auguſt 29, he was convicted for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame words in the ſaid city of Wells. At the ſame aſſizes he was convicted for uttering at St. George's in the ſaid county, theſe words: "King George is an uſurper; King James is my lawful King." He was alſo convicted at the ſame aſſizes, at Wells, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the pariſh-church at Portbury, in theſe words: "However God may in judgment allow uſurpation, yet God will never proſper or bleſs the ſame: I need not go to foreign countries for proof of this, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves to our own iſland, where we have groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under that plague theſe thirty years. We have had neither King, parliament, nor laws, theſe thirty years. Things have never been right theſe thirty years; that is, ſince the misfortune of the father; and things will never be right till the reſtoration of his ſon, my maſter." He was, moreover, convicted at the ſame aſſizes, at Wells, for preaching, in the pariſh-church of St. George, in theſe words: "King George is an uſurper." For the above-mentioned preaching, at Portbury church, he was ſentenced to ſtand in the pillory for an hour at Charing-croſs, on the firſt of December, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription over his head, "For ſeditious and treaſonable preaching;" to be impriſoned four years, and to find ſureties for his good behaviour during life; himſelf in 200 l. penalty, and two ſureties in 100 l. each. For his before-mentioned preaching in St. George's church, he was adjudged to ſtand in the pillory at the Royal Exchange, on the ſecond of December, for an hour, with the ſame inſcription over his head, and to pay a fine of 200 l. For his four other offences, above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he was fined 100 l. each.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1721.] Joſeph Hall, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> having wrote a blaſphemous pamphlet, intitled, <hi>A ſober reply to Mr. Higg's merry argument, or the Tritheiſtical doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> was tried for the ſame on March 6, and being
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0010800104:31"/>found guilty, was, on June 15, ſentenced to ſtand on the pillory at Charing-croſs; to pay a fine of 200 l. to be impriſoned for three months, and to find ſecurity for his good behaviour for ſeven years. Mr. Hall had 150 l. of his fine remitted, and his ſtanding in the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory diſpenſed with: but Mr William Wilkins, who only printed off the ſaid pamphlet, was adjudged to pay a fine of 100 l. to be impriſoned for three months, and to find ſecurity for his good behaviour for ſeven years, and had no mitigation of his ſentence.</p>
               <p>A. D. 1722.] The Quakers preſented a petition to the houſe of Commons,
<note>

                  </note> praying that a bill may be brought in for omitting in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn affirmation the words, "In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almighty God," as enjoined in an act paſſed in the reign of King William, for making their ſolemn affirmation to be equivalent to an oath, and made perpetual by a ſtatute in 1715. The houſe complied with their requeſt; but the bill gave riſe to a warm debate among the Peers. Dr. Francis Atter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Biſhop of Rocheſter ſaid, he did not know why ſuch a diſtinguiſhing mark of indulgence ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to a ſet of people who were hardly Chriſtians. His Lordſhip was ſeconded by the Earl of Strafford, Lord North and Grey, and the Archbiſhop of York: but they were oppoſed by the Earl of Sunderland, the Duke of Argyle, White Kennet Biſhop of Peterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, the Earl of Ilay, and the Earl of Macclesfield: and the queſtion being put for committing the bill, it was carried in the affirmative by ſixty-four voices againſt fourteen. On January 17, their Lordſhips were to go into a grand committee upon the ſaid bill, but were prevented by an unexpected petition from ſome of the London clergy, which was preſented by Sir William Dawes Archbiſhop of York, and was as follows:</p>

                  <p>That there is a bill now depending in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips houſe, intitled, <hi>An act for granting the people call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Quakers, ſuch a form of affirmation or declaration, as may remove the difficulties which many of them lie under.</hi> Which bill, ſhould it paſs into a law, as it may in its conſequences nearly affect the property of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in general, ſo it will, in a more eſpecial manner, endanger the legal maintenance of the clergy by tithes; inaſmuch as the people called Quakers pretend to deny the payment of tithes upon a principle of conſcience; and therefore, as your petitioners apprehend, may be under ſtrong inducements to eaſe their conſciences in that reſpect, by violating them in another, when their ſimple affirmation in behalf of friends of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion ſhall paſs in all courts of judicature for legal evidence.</p>
                  <p>However, the injuries that your petitioners in their private affairs may poſſibly ſuffer, are, as they ought to be, of ſmall account with them, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the miſchiefs which may redound to the ſociety from the indulgence intended, as it ſeems to imply, that juſtice may be duly adminiſtered, and government ſupported, without the intervention of any ſolemn ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to God, as a witneſs of the truth of what is ſaid, by all perſons, in all caſes, of great importance to the common welfare; whereas your petitioners are firmly perſuaded, that an oath was inſtituted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the ſureſt bond of fidelity among men, and hath been eſteemed, and found to be ſo, by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and experience of all ages and all nations.</p>

                  <p>Your petitioners moreover crave leave to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your Lordſhips, that, upon the beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they can get, the inſtances wherein any Quaker hath refuſed the ſolemn affirmation, preſcribed by an act in the ſeventh and eighth year of William III. have, from the paſſing that act to this day, been exceeding rare; ſo that there might be ground to hope, that the continued uſe of the ſaid ſolemn affirmation would, by degrees, have entirely cured that people of all thoſe unreaſonable prejudices againſt an oath, which the favour deſigned them by this bill may tend to ſtrengthen and confirm.</p>
                  <p>And your petitioners humbly leave it to your Lordſhips wiſe deliberations, whether ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary indulgence granted to a people already, as is conceived, too numerous, may not contribute to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their ſect, and tempt perſons to profeſs themſelves Quakers, in order to be exempted from the obligation of oaths, and to ſtand upon a foot of privilege, not allowed to the beſt Chriſtians in the kingdom.

This expoſed him to the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the miniſters, and on Auguſt 24, 1722, he was committed to the Tower on an accuſation of high-treaſon; ſeveral noblemen and gentlemen, being alſo taken into cuſtody, on the ſame pretence, about that time or before the end of the year
<note n="*" place="bottom">Of thoſe ſo taken into cuſtody none were proſecuted but Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher Layer, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was convicted of high treaſon, at the King's-bench, on Nov. 21, and, after ſeveral reſpites, executed at Tyburn, on May 17 following: and the Rev.

About the end of March, this year, a bill for inflicting pains and penalties on his Lordſhip was brought into the houſe of Commons, when Sir William Wyndham affirmed, that there was no evidence againſt him, but conjectures and hearſays. The Biſhop, as a member of the upper houſe, made no defence before the Commons: but when the bill was carried up to the Peers, his Lordſhip and counſel were heard, and ſupported by many of the ableſt ſpeakers and lawyers in that aſſembly, who pointed out the inſufficiency of the evidence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his antagoniſts not being ſo ſolicitous about an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering reaſons, as eager to put the queſtion, the bill was carried by a majority of eighty-three againſt forty-three,

By this act his Lordſhip was deprived of all offices, benefices, and dignities, and rendered incapable of enjoying any for the future: he was baniſhed the realm, and ſubjected to the pains of death, in caſe he ſhould return, as were all perſons who ſhould correſpond with him during his exile, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs authoriſed under the privy-ſeal; and the royal prerogative ſo far retrenched, that the King could not pardon him without an act of parliament.

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0010800104:38"/>Mr. John Knox, a native of Scotland, and a bold and courageous divine, was the inſtrument, in the hands of Providence, to bring about the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in that kingdom, for which he was well qualified by his undaunted ſpirit, his learning, and his eloquence, which were extraordinary for thoſe times. He had been a public preacher, in King Edward VI.'s reign, in England; was, in the next, an exile at Franckfort, and afterwards one of the Paſtors of the Engliſh congregation at Geneva: from thence he came to Edinburgh, May 2, 1559, being then 54 years of age. He ſettled at Perth; but was unwearied in his travels and labours over the whole kingdom
<note n="†" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of the Puritans, vol. i. p. 163.</note>. He had the boldneſs to maintain this poſition, "That if Kings and Princes refuſed to reform religion, inferior magiſtrates and the people, being directed and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth by their preachers, may lawfully reform within their own bounds themſelves; and if all, or the far greater part, be enlightened by the truth, they may make a public reformation."</p>
               <p>Upon this principle Knox and his brethren petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queen-mother, who was Regent for her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Queen Mary, then in France, for liberty to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble publickly or privately, for the performance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties and offices in the vulgar tongue, and for adminiſtring the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper in both kinds, according to the inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt. Their petition, tho' ſo reaſonable, not being admitted, an aſſociation was formed by a conſiderable number of the nobility, who reſolved to riſk their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in behalf of the indulgence they had requeſted. They encouraged the curates of the pariſhes within their reſpective diſtricts to read the prayers and leſſons in Engliſh; but not to expound the ſcriptures till li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was obtained from the Queen. This being practiſed, with ſucceſs, at Perth and ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0010800104:39"/>places, and no diſturbance enſuing, the aſſociation was entered into by greater numbers, and even at Edinburgh, the capital, many ſigned it</p>
               <p>Having made ſuch a multitude of proſelytes, they again petitioned the Queen-Regent, and repreſented to her the unreaſonableneſs of the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the parliament met, the congregation, or chiefs of the aſſociation, preſented a ſet of articles to the Regent, relative to liberty of conſcience, to be laid before the houſe; but ſhe would not admit them to be debated; whereupon they drew up the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and deſired it might be recorded: "That ſince they could not procure a reformation, agreeable to the word of God, from the government, that it might be lawful for them to follow the dictates of their own conſciences: that none that joined them in the profeſſion of the true faith ſhould be liable to any civil penalties, or incur any damages for ſo doing. If any tumults ariſe on the ſcore of religion, they proteſt the imputation ought not to lie upon them, who now humbly entreat for a regular remedy; and that in all other things they will be moſt loyal ſubjects."</p>
               <p>The Regent having acquainted the court of France with the ſituation of affairs, received orders to ſuffer no other religion but the Roman Catholic. and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſupply her with forces to back her proceedings. Hereupon ſhe ſummoned the inhabitants of Perth, and the reformed miniſters, to appear before her at Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and they accordingly attended, followed by multitudes of people, well armed, and determined to defend them, if any violence were offered to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This ſight filled the Regent with apprehenſions for her ſafety, and ſhe prayed the multitude might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, giving her word that nothing ſhould be decreed

Seeing the burghers had made preparations to give her a warm reception, ſhe was willing to conſent to a treaty, by which it was agreed ſhe ſhould be received into the city with all due honour, and ſuffered to reſide there ſome days, provided ſhe promiſed to make no alteration in religion, but refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what related thereto to the parliament, and the Scotch forces, on both ſides, to be diſmiſſed. But the wily Regent had no ſooner entered the city, and the reformed had diſmiſſed their troops, than ſhe broke the articles, ſet up the maſs, and left a French garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the town, with a reſolution to make it a place of arms. She alſo declared that "promiſes were not to be kept with hereticks;" whereupon the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Fife, Perth, Dundee, Angus, Merns, and Montroſe, raiſed a body of men, and engaged to ſtand by one another, in maintenance of the reformation, with their lives and fortunes. Mr. Knox inſpirited them by his prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing, and the common people, warm with reſentment, pulled down altars and images, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Popiſh ornaments in churches, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered many monaſteries. The Regent marched againſt them at the head of 2000 French, and 2000 Scotch, in French pay; but not being inclined to hazard a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſhe retired to Dunbar, and the reformers made themſelves maſters of Perth, Scoon, Stirling, and Linlithgow, which ſoon produced a truce, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed miniſters had liberty to preach in the pulpits
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0010800104:41"/>at Edinburgh, for the preſent. But the ſcene was ſoon changed, and upon receiving the recruits and money from France, the Regent took poſſeſſion of Leith, fortified it, and ſtored it with every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its defence. The confederates complained of this breach of the truce, and beſought her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the works; but ſhe commanded them not to violate their allegiance, and to lay down their arms. To inforce her commands, ſhe marched ſuddenly to Edinburgh, and obliged them to deſert that capital and retire to Stirling; but the French troops following them cloſe at the heels, they were diſperſed into the mountains. The ſpirit which actuated them was far from being abated in this diſtreſs, and they even pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a proclamation, wherein they deprived the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of her authority, and threatened to treat all thoſe as enemies who obeyed her orders. Theſe ſort of acts, tho' they were tokens of their fortitude, yet could not enable them to face the Regent's forces, whereupon they reſolved to put themſelves under the protection of Queen Elizabeth. That wiſe Princeſs weighing the nature of the caſe, and perceiving the danger that would ariſe to her own crown, as well as the Proteſtant religion, if Scotland became entirely attached to Popery, under the government of a Popiſh Queen, who was alſo Queen of France, and claimed the crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, entered into an alliance with the confederate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, to ſupport them in their religious and civil liberties; and the treaty was ſigned at Berwick, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary 27, 1560. By this treaty the Queen engaged to ſend forces into Scotland, to continue there till Scotland was reſtored to its liberties and privileges, and the French driven out of the kingdom. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth purſuant thereto ſent a body of forces, conſiſting of 7000 foot and 1200 horſe, which joined an army of the ſame force, raiſed by the confederates. This combined army was, ſometime afterwards, reinforced from the northern marches, by a large detachment,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0010800104:42"/>commanded by the Duke of Norfolk; and upon this junction they reduced Leith, and obliged the Regent to ſhut herſelf up in the caſtle of Edinburgh, where ſhe deceaſed June 10, 1560.</p>
               <p>The French alarmed at this progreſs would have reſtored Calais, provided Elizabeth would recall her forces from Scotland; but this ſhe abſolutely refuſed. But the troubles in France laid the French, ſoon after, under a neceſſity of ſending for their troops home, for which purpoſe they diſpatched plenipotentiaries into Scotland to treat with thoſe of Elizabeth about the method of withdrawing them, and the reſtoration of the Scotch to their parliamentary government.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the month of Auguſt
<note n="*" place="bottom">Calderwood ſays the beginning of July.</note> a treaty was concluded, by which a general amneſty was granted; the Engliſh and French troops were to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw in two months; and a parliament was to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with all convenient ſpeed to ſettle the affairs of religion and the kingdom. Though Francis and Mary refuſed to ratify this treaty, the parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in Auguſt 1560, by virtue thereof, without any direct authority from the crown for that purpoſe. Francis indeed died before they met, and left his wife, Queen Mary, a young, and not very prudent widow, being entirely and zealouſly attached to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and under the management of her French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
               <p>The barons and gentlemen petitioned the parliament to ſuppreſs the doctrines of the church of Rome, in certain exceptionable points; to revive the ancient church-diſcipline, and to aboliſh the Pope's uſurped authority.</p>
               <p>All this received their approbation, and the miniſters were deſired to draw up a confeſſion of faith: this they performed, in twenty-ſix articles, following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſentiments of Calvin and the foreign reformers.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0010800104:43"/>This confeſſion being read, was carried in the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only three voices diſſenting therefrom, and the Popiſh prelates offering no arguments in defence of the old religion</p>
               <p>By another act they aboliſhed the authority of the Pope, and reading maſs was to be puniſhed; for the firſt offence with loſs of goods; for the ſecond, with baniſhment; and for the third, with death. This laſt puniſhment was certainly not to be defended in theſe reformers: difference of ſentiment may ariſe from want of underſtanding, or from the prejudices of education; and no man, as a good writer has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſhould be deſtroyed for his ſincerity, unleſs his opinions tend to mutiny and treaſon, and ſap the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of civil ſociety.</p>
               <p>When the parliament broke up, a commiſſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Mr. Knox, Mr. Willock, Mr. Spotſwood, and ſome other divines, to draw up a ſcheme of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline for the church, was executed by them nearly upon the plan of the church at Geneva; ſave that they admitted ſuperintendants in the name of Biſhops, and, in the ordination of miniſters, rejected the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands; their reaſon for the latter omiſſion was, that they apprehended miracles formerly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied that ceremony, which they now imagined had ceaſed. They appointed ſuperintendants, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ten or twelve, to plant and erect kirks, and to appoint miniſters where there were none already. "But," ſay they, "theſe men muſt not live like idle Biſhops, but muſt preach themſelves twice or thrice a week, and viſit their diſtricts every three or four months, to inſpect the lives and behaviour of the parochial miniſters, to redreſs grievances, or bring them before an aſſembly of the kirk." Theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendants were to be elected by the miniſters and elders of the ſeveral provinces, and to be deprived by them for miſbehaviour. The aſſemblies of the kirk
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0010800104:44"/>were to be claſſical, provincial and national, in which laſt the ſupreme kirk juriſdiction was repoſed.</p>
               <p>The reformers warmly expected that when this plan of diſcipline was laid before the eſtates, it would meet with a parliamentary ſanction; but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was referred to future conſideration. Upon which, after the receſs of parliament, many of the nobles, barons and chief men of the nation, met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the inſtance of Mr. Knox, and ſigned the plan, reſolving to abide by the new diſcipline, till it ſhould be confirmed or altered by parliament: thus, in effect, without the authority of an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the hierarchical government was laid aſide, and the kirk of Scotland eſtabliſhed, though, as will be ſeen, it had the ſanction of no law, till ſome years after.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper, before we proceed, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the motives of the firſt reformers for making ſo great a difference in the new model of church-government, from that which had been ſo long eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and to reflect a little upon the proceedings already related.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's Hiſtory of Scotland, vol. i. p. 212. Knox, 259.</note> As the vices of the clergy had at firſt excited the indignation of mankind, and rouſed that ſpirit of enquiry which proved ſo fatal to the whole Popiſh ſyſtem: as this diſguſt at the vices of eccleſiaſtics was ſoon tranferred to their perſons, and ſhifting from them, by no violent tranſition, ſettled at laſt on the offices they enjoyed; the effects of the reformation would naturally have extended not only to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but to the government of the Popiſh church, and the ſame ſpirit which aboliſhed the former would have overturned the latter. But in Germany, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the Northern kingdoms, its operations were checked by the power and policy of their Princes, and the ancient epiſcopal juriſdiction, under a few limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0010800104:45"/>was ſtill continued in thoſe churches. The epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal hierarchy appears to be more conformable to the practice of the church, ſince Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the eſtabliſhed religion of the Roman empire. The eccleſiaſtical government was, at that time, plainly copied from the civil; the firſt not only borrowed its form, but derived its authority from the latter, and the dioceſes and juriſdiction of Patriarchs, Archbiſhops and Biſhops, correſponded with the diviſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the empire. In Switzerland and the Low Countries, the nature of the government allowing full ſcope to the genius of the reformation, all pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of order in the church was deſtroyed, and an equality eſtabliſhed more ſuitable to the ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican policy. The ſituation of the primitive church ſuggeſted the idea, and furniſhed the model of the latter ſyſtem, which has ſince been called <hi>Preſbyterian.</hi> The firſt Chriſtians, oppreſſed by continual perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and obliged to hold their religious aſſemblies by ſtealth and in corners, were contented with a form of government extremely ſimple. The influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion concurred with the ſenſe of danger, in extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing among them the ſpirit of ambition, and in preſerving a parity of rank, the effects of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the cauſe of many of their virtues — Calvin
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. ii. pag. 121, 131, &amp; ſeq. of this work.</note>, whoſe deciſions were received among the Proteſtants of that age, with incredible ſubmiſſion, was the patron and reſtorer of this ſcheme of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical policy. The church of Geneva, formed under his eye, and by his direction, was eſteemed the moſt perfect model of this government, and Knox, who during his reſidence in that city had ſtudied and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired it, warmly recommended it to the imitation of his countrymen.</p>
               <p>Among the Scotch nobles ſome hated the perſons, others coveted the wealth of the dignified clergy,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0010800104:46"/>and, by aboliſhing that order of men, the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged their reſentment, and the latter hoped to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their avarice. The people, inflamed with the moſt violent averſion to Popery, and approving every ſcheme that departed fartheſt from the practice of the Romiſh church, were delighted with a ſyſtem ſo admirably ſuited to their predominant paſſion; while the friends of civil liberty beheld, with pleaſure, the Proteſtant clergy putting down-with their own hands, that fabric of eccleſiaſtical power, which their predeceſſors had reared with ſo much art and induſtry, and flattered themſelves, that, by lending their aid to ſtrip church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their dignity and wealth, they might entirely deliver the nation from their exorbitant and oppreſſive juriſdiction. The new mode of government eaſily made its way among men thus prepared by their various intereſts and paſſions for its reception.</p>
               <p>But, on the firſt introduction of his ſyſtem, Knox did not deem it expedient to depart altogether from the ancient form
<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, 158.</note>; inſtead of Biſhops, he propoſed to eſtabliſh ten or twelve ſuperintendants in different parts of the kingdom: theſe, as the name implies, were impowered to inſpect the life and doctrine of the other clergy, as before obſerved; they preſided in the inferior judicatories of the church, and performed ſeveral other parts of the epiſcopal functions: their juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions however extended to ſacred things only, they claimed no feat in parliament, and pretended no rights to the dignity or revenues of the former Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The number of inferior clergy, to whom the care of parochial duty could be committed, was ſtill extremely ſmall. They had embraced the principles of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation at different times, and from various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: during the public commotions, they were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, merely by chance, over the different provinces of the kingdom, and in a few places only were formed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0010800104:47"/>into regular claſſes or ſocieties. The firſt general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the church which was held, December 20, 1560, bears all the marks of an infant, unformed church or ſociety; the members were but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of no conſiderable rank; no uniform or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent rule ſeems to have been obſerved in electing them. From a great part of the kingdom no repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives appeared; in the name of ſome counties only one perſon was preſent, while other ſingle towns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſeveral. A convention ſo feeble and irregular could poſſeſs no great authority; and, conſcious of their weakneſs the members put an end to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, without venturing upon any deciſion of much importance

               <p>Knox, as already obſerved, with the aſſiſtance of his brethren, in order to give greater ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to the Preſbyterian plan, compoſed the firſt book of diſcipline, which contains the model or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of the intended policy. They preſented it to a convention of the eſtates in 1561; and whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations were propoſed with regard to eccleſiaſtic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and juriſdiction, would have eaſily obtained the ſanction of that aſſembly; but a deſign to recover the patrimony of the church, which was therein inſinuated, met with a very different reception

               <p>In vain did the clergy diſplay the advantages which would accrue to the public by a proper application of eccleſiaſtical revenues; in vain did they propoſe, by an impartial diſtribution of this fund, to promote true religion, to encourage learning, and to ſupport the poor; in vain did they even intermingle threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the divine diſpleaſure, againſt the unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of what was appropriated to a ſacred uſe.

She herſelf was, by the aſſembly in 1565, confined to have maſs only in her private chapel, and unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with that pomp and oſtentation which perhaps alone rendered it the favourite ſervice of the votaries of the church of Rome. The Queen, bred up in a reverence for that church, would certainly have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited a gentler treatment than ſhe received; but the reformed did not, in her caſe, conſider the prejudices of education: the general aſſembly petitioned her to ratify the acts of parliament for aboliſhing the maſs, and for obliging all her ſubjects to frequent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed worſhip. She replied, that ſhe ſaw no impiety in the maſs, and was determined not to quit the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in which ſhe was bred, being ſatisfied it was founded in the word of God, and that her change would alſo be prejudicial to her temporal intereſt. Without any ſtretch of Chriſtian charity, theſe were certainly her ſentiments; and the return of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſembly was very coarſe, and very little to the purpoſe, viz. "That Turciſm ſtood upon as good ground as Popery." What followed, in their replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was more worthy of the venerable aſſembly, when they required her, "in the name of the eternal God, to inform herſelf better, by frequenting ſermons, and conferring with learned men." However, the Queen was not to be moved, and continued, with a blind zeal, to perſiſt in the errors ſhe had embraced.</p>
               <p>In 1567, the Pope's authority in matters eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical was again aboliſhed in the parliament and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at Edinburgh; and the act of 1560, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the juriſdiction of the court of Rome, was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0010800104:49"/>confirmed, and all acts paſſed in former reigns, for the ſupport of Popiſh idolatry, were annulled; the new confeſſion of faith was ratified, and the Proteſtant miniſters, and thoſe of their communion, declared to be the true and only church within the realm. The examination and admiſſion of miniſters was declared to be only in the power and diſpoſition of the church, with a ſaving clauſe for lay patrons. By another act, the future Kings, at their coronation, were to take an oath to maintain the reformed religion, as then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; and by a third act, none but thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the reformed religion, as then eſtabliſhed, were to be capable of being judges or proctors, or of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing in any of the courts of juſtice, excepting the right of offices hereditary, or for life.</p>
               <p>The general aſſembly declared their approbation of the diſcipline of the reformed churches of Geneva and Switzerland, and of a parity among miniſters, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſuperior claim of Biſhops. However, as theſe acts of aſſembly were not confirmed by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, epiſcopal government could not be ſaid to be legally aboliſhed, though it was tacitly ſuſpended till the King came of age, and all church-affairs managed by preſbyteries and general aſſemblies. But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſembly aſſerted their power of the keys at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, by depoſing the Biſhop of Orkney, for marrying the Queen to the Earl of Bothwell, and by making the Counteſs of Argyle do penance for aſſiſting at the marriage.</p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſtical affairs, after this, lay dormant for a conſiderable time, while the civil government under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went many extraordinary revolutions; though the church was under many uneaſy apprehenſions from the conſequences that might reſult from them, in regard to the peace and happineſs of the eccleſiaſtical body. Two things chiefly ingroſſed the attention of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. The one was, the forming a ſyſtem of diſcipline or eccleſiaſtical polity, which, with much difficulty,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0010800104:50"/>was in ſome meaſure effected; the other was, the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the epiſcopal order. This was in the year 1581. And in the year 1582. another general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the preſbytery met at Glaſgow, wherein, with much warmth, the dignities, honours, emolum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts, and the very function of Biſhops, were attacked. The nobles viewed their power with jealouſy; the common people conſidered their lives as profane, and wiſhed their downfal with equal ardour; and at length an act was paſſed, declaring the office of Biſhop, as it was then exerciſed within the realm, to have neither foundation nor warrant in the word of God; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, under pain of excommunication, all who now poſſeſſed that office, inſtantly to reſign it, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from preaching or adminiſtering the ſacrament, till they ſhould receive permiſſion from the aſſembly. Some of the proceedings of the aſſembly were laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the court, and the decree which followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; but the court did not acquieſce therein: and very warm repreſentations enſued, both from the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian and Preſbyterian parties
<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon, vol. ii. p. 74.</note>.</p>
               <p>However, an attention to civil affairs prevented any thing conſiderable to be done; inſomuch that many of the nobles, and many others of the people, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be actuated by a religious zeal, and provoked by the injuries offered to the church, determined to protect the Proteſtant religion by force of arms: they therefore conjured the King not to diſappoint their hopes and wiſhes, nor to refuſe the ſuffering church that aid which ſhe ſo much needed: but ſo little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs attended their meaſures, that the King called a convention of eſtates on June 5, 1597, who humbled the power of the church, and abridged the privileges of the city of Edinburgh. The city was declared to have forfeited its privileges as a corporation; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of the kingdom was deprived of magiſtrates, at
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0010800104:51"/>leaſt not allowed to elect their own magiſtrates, nor their own miniſters; many new burdens were impoſed on them, and a great ſum of money was exacted by way of peace-offering.</p>
               <p>King James having thus far ſucceeded in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he was now very aſſiduous in forming and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting other ſchemes to complete his deſign: and in order, if poſſible, to gain the clergy, whom he had in vain attempted to ſubdue, popular agents were ſet to work all over the kingdom; promiſes, flattery, and threats were employed; the uſurpations of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, near the capital, were aggravated; the jealouſy of their power, which was growing in the diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, was augmented, and two different general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles were held, in both which, notwithſtanding the zeal and boldneſs wherewith a few leading clergymen defended the privileges of the church, a majority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in favour of thoſe meaſures which were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the King. Many practices, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſince the reformation, were condemned; many points of diſcipline, which had hitherto been reckoned ſacred and uncontroverted, were given up: the licence with which miniſters diſcourſed of political things was reſtrained, the freedom with which they inveighed againſt particular perſons cenſured, the convoking a general aſſembly without the King's permiſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and the right of nominating miniſters in the principal towns veſted in the crown. Thus, the clergy themſelves ſurrendered privileges which it would have been dangerous to invade by force, and ſubjected themſelves and ſucceſſors to an intolerable yoke, which leſſened the popular topic of the encroachments of the King, and turned the general out-cry of the people on the corruptions of their own order

               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0010800104:52"/>The King however found it no eaſy matter to carry his point, though he was ſo intent upon new-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling the church as to neglect other objects of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Towards the end of the year 1598, a parliament was held in order to confer certain privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and honours upon the Biſhops; and an act was paſſed, by which thoſe miniſters on whom the King ſhould confer the vacant biſhoprics, ſhould be intitled to vote in parliament; and that the clergy might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no jealouſy of any encroachments on their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, it was remitted to the general aſſembly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what ſpiritual juriſdiction or authority in the government of the church, theſe perſons ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs: but though the clergy perceived it would be an acceſſion of honour to be admitted into the ſupreme council of the nation, their abhorrence of epiſcopacy was extreme; and to this they ſacrificed every conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of intereſt or ambition. All the King's profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of regard for the preſent conſtitution of the church did not convince them of his ſincerity; their own experience had taught them with what inſinuating progreſs the hierarchy advances, and though admitted at firſt with moderate authority, and under ſpecious pretences, how rapidly it extends its dominion. "Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh over this ſcheme," ſaid one of the clergymen, "with what colours you pleaſe; deck the intruder with the utmoſt art; under all this diſguiſe, I ſee the horns of his mitre." The ſame ſentiments prevailed among many of his brethren, and induced them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject power and honours, with as much zeal as ever thoſe of their order courted them. Many, however, were allured by hopes of preferment. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his miniſters employed the ſame arts which they had tried ſo ſucceſsfully laſt year; and after long debates and much oppoſition the general aſſembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it was lawful for miniſters to accept of a ſeat in parliament; that it would be highly beneficial to the church to have its repreſentatives in that ſupreme
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0010800104:53"/>court; and that fifty-one perſons, a number nearly equal to that of the eccleſiaſtics who were antiently called to parliament, ſhould be choſen from among the clergy for that purpoſe; but the manner of their election, together with the power with which they ſhould be inveſted, were left undecided for the preſent, and furniſhed matter for future deliberation
<note n="*" place="bottom">Spotſwood, 450. Robertſon, 208.</note>.</p>
               <p>The queſtions with regard to the election and power of the repreſentatives of the church were finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the year 1600, by the general aſſembly, which met at Montroſe; and it was there agreed, that the general aſſembly ſhould recommend ſix perſons to every vacant benefice, which gave a title to a ſeat in parliament, out of whom the King ſhould nominate one: that the perſon ſo elected ſhould neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nor conſent to any thing there, that may affect the intereſt of the church, without ſpecial inſtructions for that purpoſe: that he ſhall ſubmit to its cenſure without appeal: that he ſhall diſcharge the duty of a paſtor in a particular congregation: that he ſhall not uſurp any eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction ſuperior to that of his other brethren: that he ſhould annually reſign his commiſſion to the general aſſembly, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him or not, as the aſſembly, with the King's approbation, ſhall judge moſt expedient for the good of the church

               <p>In the year 1617, James (who aſcended the Engliſh throne on the twenty-third of March 1603, and ſoon after went to reſide in England) to advance the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal cauſe, made a progreſs into Scotland, and his chapel at Edinburgh was adorned with ſtatues and pictures. Two acts were paſſed, one relative to the choice of Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and the ſecond for the reſtitution of chapters; and the miniſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt them, many of them were ſuſpended, and ſome baniſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0010800104:54"/>In 1618, in a convention held at Perth, the court and Biſhops, with ſome difficulty, made a ſhift to carry five articles, importing, that the holy ſacrament ſhould be received kneeling; that miniſters ſhould be enabled to adminiſter the ſacrament in private houſes to the ſick; that they ſhould baptize children privately at home, if requeſted ſo to do; that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſuch children as can ſay their catechiſm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Lord's prayer, creed, and ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that the feſtivals of Chriſtmas, Eaſter, Whitſuntide, and aſcenſion of our Saviour, ſhould for the future be commemorated in the kirk of Scotland. Theſe articles were ordered to be publiſhed at the market-croſſes, and to be read by the miniſters in the pulpits; but the greateſt number of them refuſed, as there was no penalty incurred by the omiſſion, ſave the King's diſpleaſure. Notwithſtanding the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miniſters, the court got theſe articles ratified by the parliament in 1621, contrary to the ſenſe of the kirk and nation. This raiſed ſo much ill blood, that a new perſecution was carried on throughout the kingdom; numbers of the Preſbyterian miniſters were fined, impriſoned, and baniſhed by the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and this they ſuffered, though from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the people they could have turned their oppreſſors out of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Things remained much in the ſame ſtate till the reign of King Charles the Firſt. That unhappy Monarch, preſſed on by Laud, made a progreſs into Scotland, in the year 1633, with a view to advance the epiſcopacy; for notwithſtanding Biſhops had exiſted in Scotland for ſome years, they had little more than the name, being ſubject to an aſſembly that was purely Preſbyterian. To advance their juriſdiction, he had renewed the high commiſſion, and forbid all general aſſemblies of the kirk. He was crowned at Edinburgh, June 18, and on the 20th the parliament met, and very complaiſantly gave him a large ſum of money; but in the matter of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0010800104:55"/>the acts <hi>concerning his royal prerogative,</hi> and the <hi>apparel of kirkmen,</hi> and <hi>for the ratification of former acts touching religion,</hi> he behaved to his parliament with ſuch arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, overbearing haughtineſs, and carried them through with ſuch barefaced craft, that he diſguſted all ranks and orders of people; which, together with the contempt he poured upon the Scots clergy, and the high hand with which he attempted to introduce the ceremonies of the church of England, alienated the affections of the generality of his Scotch ſubjects: nor did Laud's behaviour there do him the leaſt credit, or redound at all to his maſter's intereſt. The mouths of the Scots clergy were opened; and they inveighed bitterly againſt the hierarchy of England. To widen the breach, in 1635, a book of canons for Scotland was drawn up by the new Biſhops of that kingdom, and reviſed by Laud, Juxon and Wren, which was confirmed by the King under his great ſeal, May 23, though ſubverſive of the whole conſtitution of Scotland, in kirk and ſtate. The Scots Preſbytery declared peremptorily againſt it.</p>
               <p>In the year 1637, a new liturgy, in ſubſtance the ſame with the Engliſh, was ſent into Scotland, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a royal proclamation, dated Dec 12, 1636, commanding all the King's loving ſubjects of that kingdom to receive it with reverence, <hi>as the only form his Majeſty thinks fit to be uſed in that kirk,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as laying it before a ſynod, convocation, general aſſembly, or parliament of that nation; ſo precipitant and imprudent was this head-ſtrong ill-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Prince, in all the meaſures he purſued relative to that kingdom, the genius of whoſe inhabitants he ſeemed totally unacquainted with. The reading it in the pulpits was oppoſed by the people in a moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and tumultuous manner; and notwithſtanding the repreſentation of the conſequences likely to enſue, from the Lords of the privy-council to the court, they were peremptorily ordered to go on with their work.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0010800104:56"/>The oppoſers publiſhed their reaſons; two petitions were preſented againſt it to the Lord Chancellor and Council, one from all the men, women, children and ſervants of Edinburgh, another in the names of the noblemen, barons, gentry, miniſters and burgeſſes, which were tranſmitted to the King, who, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning a ſoft anſwer, iſſued a proclamation againſt the late tumults, forbidding all aſſemblies or convocations of people to frame or ſign petitions, upon pain of high treaſon, and ordering the term or ſeſſion to be moved from Linlithgow to Stirling, twenty-four miles from Edinburgh, with a ſtrict injunction that no ſtranger ſhould reſort thither without ſpecial licence. Upon the publication of this proclamation, ſundry noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, miniſters and others, ſigned a proteſt; four TABLES, as they were called, were erected at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, one of the nobility, another of the gentry, a third of the burroughs, and a fourth of the miniſters. Theſe prepared matters for <hi>the general Table,</hi> formed of commiſſioners from the other ſour, where the laſt and binding reſolutions were taken. One of the firſt things tranſacted by theſe tables, was the renewing their confeſſion of faith and ſolemn league and covenant, which had been ſubſcribed by King James, March 2, 1580-1, and by the whole Scots nation in the year 1590. To this covenant was now added, a narrative of ſundry acts of parliament, by which the religion of the reformed had been ratified ſince that time, with an admonition, wherein the late innovations were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and a band of defence for adhering to each other in the preſent cauſe. This ſolemn league and covenant, in ſupport of their religious and civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in oppoſition to Popery, tyranny and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was ſworn to and ſubſcribed with great ſeriouſneſs and devotion, firſt at Edinburgh, in Feb. 1637-8, and afterwards in all places of the kingdom, where it was received by the common people as a ſacred oracle,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0010800104:57"/>and ſubſcribed by all who had any zeal for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion and their country.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the King ſent the Marquis of Hamilton as his high commiſſioner into Scotland, one part of his commiſſion being to induce them to give up the covenant, upon which he was to conſent to the calling a general aſſembly or parliament; but the covenanters declared they would ſooner renounce their baptiſm than their covenant. Finding them full of this reſolution, and nothing to be done but by force of arms, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England: but was ſoon ſent back again, and inſtructed, if neceſſity required, to revoke the liturgy, canons, the high commiſſion, and the five ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Perth. He might call a general aſſembly and parliament within a competent time, but was to endeavour to exclude the laity from the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>On Nov. 21, 1638, the Marquis publiſhed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for a general aſſembly, to meet at Glaſgow. The covenanters carried their elections every where, a ſilenced miniſter, Mr. Henderſon, was choſen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator; and though the Biſhops preſented a <hi>Declinator,</hi> declaring the aſſembly to be unlawful, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the Marquis, finding them not of a proper temper for the court, diſſolved them, after having preſided ſeven days, forbidding them to continue their ſeſſions upon pain of high treaſon, the aſſembly continued ſitting, and next day publiſhed a juſtification of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They ſat for ſome weeks, till they had paſſed ſeveral acts, viz. An act <hi>for diſannulling ſix late aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, viz. thoſe of</hi> 1606, 8, 10, 16, 17, 18, <hi>with the reaſons:</hi> An act <hi>for abjuring and aboliſhing epiſcopacy:</hi> An act <hi>for condemning the five articles of Perth:</hi> An act <hi>for condemning the ſervice book, book of canons, book of ordination, and the high commiſſion:</hi> An act <hi>for condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Archdeacons, Chapters, and preaching Deacons:</hi> An act <hi>for reſtoring Presbyteries, provincial and national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to their conſtitution of miniſters and elders, and to their power and juriſdiction contained in the book of policy;</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0010800104:58"/>with many others of like nature. They afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence of depoſition againſt the Biſhops; eight of whom were excommunicated, four excluded from the miniſterial function, and two only allowed to officiate as paſtors or preſbyters. At the cloſe of the ſeſſion the aſſembly drew up a letter to the King, complaining of the Marquis of Hamilton, who had proclaimed them traitors, and forbid the people to pay any regard to their acts; and praying him ſtill to look upon them as good and faithful ſubjects. They pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed alſo an addreſs to the good people of England, in their own vindication, which the King ſuppreſſed, and iſſued a proclamation againſt the covenanters.</p>
               <p>Thus matters between the King and his Scottiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were brought to ſuch a criſis as could not but end in a war. Charles fitted out a fleet of ſixteen ſhips, and raiſed an army of 21,000 horſe and foot. On the other hand, the covenanters ſecured the caſtles of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh. Dumbritton and Frith, raiſed an army, and ſent for their old General Leſley, from Germany, who brought with him many experienced officers. On the the 27th of March 1639, the King marched north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and was met, upon the borders by the Scots army; but after facing each other, for ſome time, the King perceiving his Engliſh Proteſtant nobility and ſoldiers not hearty in the cauſe, came to a pacification with the covenanters, June 17, by which all points of difference were referred to a general aſſembly, to be held at Edinburgh, Auguſt 12 enſuing, and to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which was to meet a fortnight after. Both armies, in the interim, were to be diſbanded; the tables broke up, and no meetings held, but ſuch as were warranted by act of parliament. The King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly diſmiſſed his army, ſcarcely affording thanks to them for their affection and loyalty. The Scots delivered up the King's caſtles and forts, and diſbanded their troops; but cautiouſly kept their officers in pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0010800104:59"/>The general aſſembly met according to the treaty, at Edinburgh; but being conſtituted as the laſt, the King having given up the point of the lay-elders, the Biſhops, who preſented another <hi>Declinator,</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed attendance by the King. The aſſembly then, without any oppoſition, confirmed the proceedings of that of Glaſgow, appointed the covenant to be taken throughout the kingdom, voted away the new ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, &amp;c. &amp;c. and, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> determined that <hi>dioceſan epiſcopacy was unlawful, and not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in their kirk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parliament met Aug 31, and confirmed all the acts of the general aſſembly; but having mentioned epiſcopacy as <hi>unlawful,</hi> the King forbid the Earl of Traquair, his commiſſioner, to conſent to the word, leſt it ſhould be interpreted abſolutely; whereupon he firſt prorogued the parliament for fourteen days, and then, by the King's expreſs command, for nine months, without ratifying any of their acts.</p>
               <p>The pacification between the King and the Scots was not of long duration; for, puſhed on by Laud and Strafford, he reſolved to humble his northern ſubjects, who had dared to diſpute his prerogative. The Scots dreading the impending ſtorm, were, many of them, for ſeeking ſuccour from France; and accordingly wrote a letter to the King of France, which however was not ſent. The majority of the Scots nation caſt their eye towards the Engliſh parliament, which was called together to aid in their deſtruction, and met April 13, 1640, and, upon application to their friends at London, were aſſured, by a letter written by Lord Saville, "That the hearts of the people of England were with them; that they were convinced the liberties of both nations were at ſtake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might depend upon their aſſiſtance, as ſoon as a fair opportunity offered." Upon this aſſurance the Scots reſolved to raiſe another army, and to march into England. Mean time Charles, not meeting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0010800104:60"/>with a behaviour he expected, diſſolved the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, to carry on the war againſt the Scots, ſet every engine of arbitrary power at work, ſuch as loans, benevolences, ſhip-money, &amp;c. &amp;c. by which he got an army together compoſed of Papiſts and preſſed men, who had no affection for the ſervice. However, with this army the King met the Scots upon the borders; but ſoon found that the Engliſh nobility were not for conquering them. After a ſmall ſkirmiſh the Scots army paſſed the Tweed, Aug. 21, and on the 30th took poſſeſſion of Newcaſtle, whilſt the King retreated before them as far as York, leaving them maſters of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Durham, from which counties they ſubſiſted their army, and levied what contributions they pleaſed. When they entered Newcaſtle, they ſent an expreſs to aſſure the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that they would not interrupt the trade between it and that town, but would cultivate all manner of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and brotherly correſpondence. They alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched meſſengers to the King, petitioning his Majeſty "to confirm their late acts of parliament, reſtore their ſhips and merchandiſe, recal his proclamation which ſtiles them rebels, and call an Engliſh parliament, to ſettle the peace between both kingdoms." This petition was backed by others from ſeveral of the Engliſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and the city of London. The King finding he muſt come to terms, appointed commiſſioners to treat with the Scots at Rippon, who agreed to a ceſſation of arms for three months, from Oct. 26; the Scots to have 850l. <hi>per diem,</hi> for the maintenance of the army, and the treaty to be adjourned to London, where a free parliament was to be immediately called. This famous long parliament was opened Nov. 3, in which the late commiſſioners exhibited articles againſt Archbiſhop Laud, and, by co-operating with them in their oppoſition to the King's meaſures and miniſters, contributed greatly to their future ſucceſs againſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and epiſcopacy.</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0010800104:61"/>In the year 1641, when King Charles was greatly diſtreſſed by the vigorous proceedings of the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England againſt the Biſhops, and other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, knowing they were greatly encouraged therein by their confederacy with the Scots, whoſe army in the north was entirely in their intereſt, it was reſolved in council, if poſſible, to diſunite that nation from the parliament, and bring them over to the King, by granting them all their deſires; and for that purpoſe he reſolved upon a progreſs into Scotland. Aug. 10 the King ſet out poſt, and arrived there in three or four days; but the Engliſh parliament, aware of his deſign, appointed one lord and two commoners to follow his Majeſty, in order to keep up a good correſpondence with the parliament of that nation. Aug. 19, he opened the parliament there with a very conciliating ſpeech, and agreeable thereto he allowed of their late oppoſition to the liturgy, and their erecting <hi>Tables;</hi> he confirmed the acts of the aſſembly at Glaſgow; he followed their manner of worſhip, conferred titles upon many of their gentry; and, when he left the kingdom, all parties ſeemed contented. But, from all accounts, the King ſoon repented of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances, and as to the Scots, they ſtill thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to cultivate a good underſtanding: with the Engliſh parliament.</p>
               <p>The Scots, now eaſy at home, and in full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their religious and civil rights, yet did not look with indifference upon affairs in England, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ruin of the Engliſh parliament, as well through gratitude for the favours they had received from them, as for their future ſafety; and therefore the Scots commiſſioners at London offered their mediation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the two houſes, telling his Majeſty, in their petition, "That the liberties of England and Scotland muſt ſtand and fall together," and beſeeching him "to have recourſe to the faithful advices of both houſes of parliament, which will not only quiet the minds of his Engliſh ſubjects, but remove the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0010800104:62"/>and fears that may poſſeſs the hearts of his ſubjects in his other kingdoms." In their addreſs to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh parliament they acknowledge their obligations to them, and beſeech the two houſes "to conſider of the faireſt and moſt likely methods to compoſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in church and ſtate." Biſhop Burnet ſays, their deſign was to get Epiſcopacy brought down, and Preſbytery ſet up; to the "firſt of which moſt of the members were willing to conſent, but few were cordial for the latter."</p>
               <p>The King was much diſpleaſed with the Scots medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and commanded them not to tranſact between him and his parliament, without firſt communicating their propoſitions to him, in private; and in Scotland he uſed methods to keep that kingdom neutral. On the other hand, the parliament threw themſelves into the arms of the Scots, they thanked the commiſſioners for their kind and ſeaſonable interpoſing, and prayed them to continue their endeavours to remove the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtractions, and to preſerve the union between the two kingdoms. They writ to Scotland alſo to the ſame purpoſe. In May 1642, they again renewed their offers of a mediation, which the King rejected as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but the parliament accepted of it, and ſeemed to come heartily into their ſcheme of church-government, ſo that a perfect union took place between the two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. The King alarmed hereat, ſent a warm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance to the council of Scotland, Auguſt 26, wherein he very juſtly obſerves, that "the parliament no more believed the <hi>divine inſtitution of Preſbytery,</hi> than the others did of <hi>dioceſan Prelacy;</hi> for though they were content, in order to ſecure the aſſiſtance of the Scots nation, to vote away the hierarchy of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops, yet when they had conquered the King, and had nothing to fear from their neighbours, they could not be prevailed with to eſtabliſh the Scots Preſbytery, without a reſerve of the power of the keys to themſelves."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0010800104:63"/>It is foreign to my purpoſe to enter too deeply into the civil and military hiſtory of this unfortunate reign, further than to elucidate the hiſtory of the kirk of Scotland; and therefore I ſhall next take notice, that, in the year 1643, the general aſſembly of Scotland agreed to aſſiſt the Engliſh for the recovery of their civil and religious liberties, and appointed delegates to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of divines at Weſtminſter. On Sept. 25, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh houſe of Commons and the aſſembly of divines, to ſecure the aſſiſtance of the Scots, took the ſolemn league and covenant, after many debates in relation to the renunciation of Epiſcopacy, and ſome other points, by ſubſcribing their names thereto, the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in one parchment-roll, and the aſſembly in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in St. Margaret's church, Weſtminſter. On the Sunday following it was tendered to all perſons within the bills of mortality, after being read in the ſeveral churches. October 15, it was likewiſe taken by the houſe of Lords. In Scotland it was inforced, all over the kingdom, under the ſevereſt penalties. February 1644, it was ordered to be taken through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdom of England, by all perſons above the age of eighteen years, an exhortation from the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter aſſembly of divines being drawn up and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for that purpoſe. The greateſt number were zealous for the covenant on a religious account, and others in obedience to the parliament, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the diſtreſſed circumſtances of their affairs, and that the aſſiſtance of the Scots was to be obtained upon no other terms. The impoſing it as a teſt, however, was far from being juſtifiable, for ſeveral evident reaſons. The King publiſhed a declaration againſt it in England, and ſent one, to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, into Scotland, which had no other effect than to produce the reaſons for their conduct, and advice to his Majeſty to take the covenant himſelf.</p>

Afterwards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined army reduced all the northern garriſons, which concluded the war in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>The King's affairs becoming deſperate, on the 27th of April 1646, he eſcaped from Oxford, and threw himſelf into the hands of the Scots army, then lying before Newark. Little or nothing occurred relative to the kirk during the nine months the King continued with the Scots, but altercations between them and the Engliſh parliament and aſſembly, relative to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Preſbytery and toleration of Separatiſts in England, which the Preſbyterians now as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt, as ever the Papiſts, or church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had done in Queen Elizabeth's days. "We are perſuaded, ſays the parliament of Scotland, that the piety and wiſdom of the honourable houſes will never admit toleration of any ſects or ſchiſms, contrary to our ſolemn league and covenant."</p>
               <p>The King, determining not to aboliſh Epiſcopacy, and withſtanding the ſolicitations and prayers of his friends, nay even the advice of his Queen, all attempts at an accommodation with his parliament proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; therefore, as the clergy of Scotland would not ſuffer him to come into that kingdom, unleſs he took the ſolemn league and covenant, and did all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and their parliament reſolved the kingdom ſhould be ſecured without him, and that <hi>they ſhould leave the King in England to his two houſes of parliament,</hi> upon their agreeing to pay the Scots army their arrears, and 200,000l. one moiety thereof on the delivering up the King into the hands of the Engliſh parliament's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0010800104:65"/>he was delivered up, and conducted to Holmby houſe, in Northamptonſhire.</p>
               <p>The further tranſactions of this reign have very little relation to the affairs of the kirk of Scotland, who were entirely averſe to the ſecret treaty with the King, in purſuance of which Duke Hamilton marched into England with an army, and was defeated at Preſton by Cromwell, after which he marched triumphantly to Edinburgh, Auguſt 17, 1648. They indeed, by their commiſſioners, declared and proteſted againſt putting the King to death, as abſolutely inconſiſtent with their ſolemn league and covenant.</p>
               <p>In June 1650, the Commonwealth of England having departed from the ſolemn league and covenant, the Scots, who at the King's death proclaimed the Prince of Wales, entered into a treaty with the exiled King at Breda, ſubjecting him thereby to the following very mortifying conditions: That all perſons excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the kirk, ſhould be forbid the court: that the King, by his ſolemn oath, and under his hand and ſeal, declare his allowance of the covenant: that he confirm thoſe acts of parliament which enjoin the covenant: that he eſtabliſh the Preſbyterian worſhip and diſcipline, and ſwear never to oppoſe or endeavour to alter them: that all civil matters be determined by parliament; and all eccleſiaſtical affairs by the kirk: that his Majeſty ratify all that has been done in the parliament of Scotland, in ſome late ſeſſions, and ſign the covenant upon his arrival in that kingdom, if the kirk deſired it. He arrived June 16, but was obliged to ſign both the covenants before he ſet his feet on ſhore. The Covenanters raiſed an army of 16,000 foot and 6000 horſe for his ſervice; whereupon the Engliſh parliament ſent General Cromwell againſt them, who entered Scotland, at the latter end of July, with an army of 11,000 foot and 5000 horſe. After various marches and counter-marches, and ſome alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations between the Engliſh aſſembly and Cromwell,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0010800104:66"/>he was obliged, not being able to bring the Scots to action, to retire to Dunbar, for want of proviſions, with a weak and ſickly army, and an enemy hovering over them 27,000 ſtrong; but, however, he totally routed this great hoſt, in the battle of Dunbar, fought September 13, killing 4000 in the battle and purſuit, and taking 10,000 priſoners, with great quantities of arms, ammunition, &amp;c. &amp;c. and with the loſs to the Engliſh of ſcarce 300 men
<note n="†" place="bottom">Kimber's Life of Oliver Cromwell, 6th edit. p. 175.</note>. Cromwell, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the battle, took poſſeſſion of Edinburgh and Leith, and ſent to the miniſters, who had fled to the caſtle, to reſume their functions in the churches; but this they refuſed to do, whereupon Cromwell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Engliſh miniſters to officiate in their places.</p>
               <p>The Scots committees of the kirk and eſtates having fled to Stirling, and being joined by thoſe who had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from Dunbar, endeavoured to aſſemble another body of forces; but they were ſo divided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that little was done to the purpoſe. The ruling party was for the King and kirk; the <hi>Reſolutioners</hi> were ſo called from their adhering to the reſolution of the kirk and ſtates, "that thoſe who had been too back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ought to be admitted to make profeſſion of their repentance, and afterwards, in the preſent extremity, might be admitted to defend and ſerve their country:" The <hi>Proteſters</hi> proteſted againſt this reſolution: the <hi>Remonſtrators,</hi> in the weſtern counties, formed an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation apart, as well againſt the King and the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the kirk party, as againſt the army of ſectaries. Whilſt theſe debated and wrangled, Cromwell reduced Darlington houſe, Roſlan caſtle, and obtained a victory over the Remonſtrators, at Hamilton. Soon after he reduced the maiden caſtle of Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>January 1, 1650-1, the Covenanters crowned the King at Scoone, who ſet up his ſtandard at Aberdeen, whilſt the Engliſh reduced Hume and Tantallon caſtles.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0010800104:67"/>The King having got together an army of 20,000 men, encamped at Torwood near Stirling, and afterwards at Kelſyth, from which ſituations all Cromwell's generalſhip could not draw him to an engagement; hereupon he reduced Calendar houſe in ſight of their army, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a detachment of his army croſſing to Fife, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated a ſtrong body of Scots with great ſlaughter. This overthrow threw the Scots army into much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, which decamped and marched into Stirling park, whilſt detachments from the Engliſh army made themſelves maſters of Bruntiſland and St. Johnſtown, by which it hindered any ſupply of men and proviſions being ſent from the Highlands to the King's army. The King thus diſtreſſed, a reſolution was taken to make an irruption into England, and, on the laſt of July 1651, he began his march from Stirling for that purpoſe, and on the 6th of Auguſt entered this kingdom by the way of Carliſle, which cauſed great conſternation to the powers at Weſtminſter. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Cromwell was ſoon, however, at his heels, and finally defeated him, at Worceſter, on September 3, with the loſs of almoſt all the Scots army killed or taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>Major-General Monk, whom Cromwell had left to command in Scotland, ſoon finiſhed the reduction of that kingdom, after which, for eight years, it enjoyed a ſtate of calm, under the uſurpation; a ſtrong Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh army was kept there under good pay and good diſcipline, a ſort of union of the three kingdoms took place, in one parliament, to which the Scots ſent their repreſentatives, and thoſe eight years were reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a time of peace and proſperity to Scotland, as Biſhop Burnet obſerves. As to the power of the kirk, it was reduced into a narrow compaſs
<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of the Puritans, vol. iv. p. 53.</note>; "for though they had the liberty to excommunicate offenders, or debar them the communion, they might not ſeize their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0010800104:68"/>eſtates, or deprive them of their civil rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. No oaths or covenants were to be impoſed but by direction from Weſtminſter; and as all fitting encouragement was to be given to the miniſters of the eſtabliſhed kirk, ſo others, not ſatisfied with their form of church-government, had liberty to ſerve God after their own manner; and thoſe who would live peaceably, and yield obedience to the commonwealth, were protected in their ſeveral perſuaſions. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a great commotion among the clergy, who complained "of the loſs of their covenant and church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcipline, and exclaimed againſt the toleration, as opening a door to all kinds of error and hereſy." The parliament of England ſending Independent commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to viſit the Scots univerſities, and to ſettle li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience, the aſſembly at Edinburgh pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a <hi>Teſtimony againſt the preſent incroachments of the civil power upon the eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction.</hi> When the general aſſembly met again at Edinburgh, and were juſt entering upon buſineſs, Colonel Cotterel told them, that no eccleſiaſtical judicatories were to ſit there but by authority of the parliament of England; and without giving them leave to reply, he commanded them to retire, conducted them out of the weſt-gate of the city, with a troop of horſe, and a company of foot, and having taken away the commiſſions from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral claſſes, injoined them not to aſſemble any more above three in a company.</p>
               <p>In 1654, Oliver Cromwell Protector, the kingdom of Scotland was, by his ordinance, incorporated with England into one-commonwealth, and proviſion made, that in every parliament thirty members ſhould be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence to ſerve for Scotland.</p>
               <p>Upon the reſtoration of Charles II. a parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen according to the mind of the court, all went againſt the Covenanters; Epiſcopacy was reſtored, and Deacons, Prieſts, and Biſhops, ordained and conſecrated, according to the rites of the church of England. All
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0010800104:69"/>this was performed by the ſole virtue of the King's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative (for it was not till the next year that a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decided the matter) in breach of the ſolemn league and covenant, which he had, indeed, been <hi>forced</hi> to take. Several of the Scots miniſters preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boldly againſt theſe meaſures; for which Mr. James Guthrie, miniſter of Stirling, was convicted of ſedition and treaſon, and executed June 14, 1661, dying with all the holy confidence of a Chriſtian, and the fortitude of a martyr. A young officer who ſuffered with him, in the ſame cauſe, made uſe of theſe expreſſions: "I bear witneſs with my blood, to the perſecuted govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this church, by ſynods and preſbyteries; I bear witneſs to the ſolemn league and covenant, and ſeal it with my blood. I likewiſe teſtify againſt all Popery, Prelacy, Idolatry, Superſtition, and the Service Book, which is no better than a relick of Popiſh idolatry." Soon afterwards the rights of patronages were reſtored, and all the Preſbyterian miniſters ſilenced, though the court had not a ſupply of men of any ſort to fill the vacancies occaſioned thereby. The ſilenced clergy had been moſt exemplary in their lives and converſations, conſtant preachers, and expounders, indefatigable in the diſcharge of their functions, and almoſt adored by the people, though they kept up a very ſevere diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the church: but their ſucceſſors the Biſhops and clergy were of a quite different ſtamp; moſt of them very mean divines, vicious in their morals, idle and negligent of their cures; ſo that they became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the whole nation, and could hardly, even with the aſſiſtance of the civil power, ſupport their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The people, generally of the Preſbyterian perſuaſion, ſtood firm by one another, forſook the churches, and many of them were thrown into priſon, and ill uſed, ſome were fined, and the younger ſort whipped about the ſtreets; ſo that great numbers tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themſelves to Ulſter in Ireland, where they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0010800104:70"/>were well received, and where their poſterity flouriſh to this day.</p>
               <p>In 1666, Sir James Turner being ſent into the Weſt, to levy fines at diſcretion, the people roſe in arms, and took him and all his ſoldiers priſoners; but were ſoon diſperſed by the King's forces, forty of them killed, and 130 taken priſoners, many of whom were hanged before their own doors. Their miniſter was put to the torture, and died with great firmneſs, crying out, "Farewel ſun, moon, and ſtars; farewel kindred and friends, world and time, and this weak and frail body; and welcome eternity, welcome angels and ſaints, welcome Saviour of the world, and God the judge of all!" Conventicles abounded in all parts; the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian miniſters preached in their own houſes to the people, who ſtood without doors to hear them; and when diſperſed by the magiſtrates, they went out into the fields, to hear the word, carrying arms with them for their defence. A ſevere act was publiſhed againſt houſe and field conventicles; but the people ſtill met together in defiance of the law: and many, who were called Cameronians, from Cameron their preacher, were outlawed, and therefore left their habitations, and travelled about the country: at length, collecting themſelves into a body, they were routed by the Duke of Monmouth, at Bothwell-bridge, 400 of them killed, and 1200 taken priſoners. Two of their miniſters were hanged, and 200 baniſhed to the plantations, who were all loſt at ſea. In ſhort, a perſecution ſpread thro' the iſland, during the greateſt part of this reign, almoſt as cruelly and oppreſſively carried on as the Romiſh inquiſition.</p>
               <p>The parliament that met at Edinburgh, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of James II. in 1685, very compliantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their abhorrence of all principles derogatory of the King's abſolute power, and offered their lives and fortunes to ſupport it, againſt all oppoſers. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it high treaſon to give or take the national cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0010800104:71"/>or even to write in defence of it; and paſſed an act, whereby it was made death to reſort to any field or houſe conventicles. They likewiſe obliged the ſubjects of Scotland to take an oath, when ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do, to maintain the King's <hi>abſolute power,</hi> on pain of baniſhment. Popery began now to lift up its head in that kingdom, and ſeveral perſons of diſtinction changed to that religion, and accommodated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the times for the ſake of private intereſt. The populace, on the other hand, were very tumultuous; they broke into the Earl of Perth's private chapel for maſs, and defaced and deſtroyed all they could lay their hands on, for which one of them was taken and hanged. When the King diſpenſed with the penal laws and teſts, the Scots parliament agreed to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of them for the King's life; but James inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an entire repeal, which they had firmneſs to oppoſe, he diſſolved them, with tokens of reſentment. The Epiſcopal clergy, who were obſequious ſlaves to the court, were ſunk into ſuch miſerable ſloth and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as to render their hearers, particularly the common people, quite indifferent to the affairs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: but the Preſbyterians, on the other hand, ſeemed to have gained new ſtrength from perſecution, and though, by the King's diſpenſing power, freed, in 1687, from the ſeverities under which they had for ſo many years ſuffered, it did not cool their zeal againſt Popery; their averſion to that corrupt church was more and more apparent: their oppoſition, at length, rouſed the whole nation from the lethargy into which it was apparently ſunk. Their behaviour at this critical time, when it was natural to ſuppoſe, after they had fared ſo ill, that they would with joy and without reſerve have fallen in with the meaſures of the King, which gave them preſent relief from their burdens, will ever redound to the honour of the church of Scotland, and evince that the principles of religion, firmly fixed and rooted in the heart, are eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0010800104:72"/>from mere profeſſions, which generally change with the times, and give no ſtability or firmneſs to thoſe who embrace them. The Scots perceived, that the King's view in taking off the penal laws and teſts was only to ſerve the Papiſts; and therefore, when preſſed by him to concur in that meaſure, they very wiſely anſwered in cold and general terms.</p>
               <p>At length, the perſecuted, the ſuffering church of Scotland, was redeemed from its perils by the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had reſtored liberty and religion in its ſiſter kingdom. On the 11th of April 1689 a convention, like that in England, for ſettling the government, was called in Scotland, which paſſed judgment of forfeiture on King James, and voted King William and Queen Mary, King and Queen of Scotland. One article of the claim of rights they drew up, was, that "the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Scotland having been begun by a parity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the clergy, prelacy in the church was a great and inſupportable grievance to the kingdom." As the Biſhops and Epiſcopalians left the convention, becauſe not ſummoned by the abdicated King, and continued to adhere to him, the Preſbyterians carried all before them. The malecontents ſent for King James to come into Scotland, and the Earl of Dundee got together a conſiderable army of Highlanders; but was routed by General Mackay, at Killicrankey, and the Earl himſelf ſlain. Thus, with King James, Epiſcopacy was baniſhed from Scotland, and the kirk-diſcipline and worſhip reſtored; without a toleration, however, to Diſſenters from that church.</p>
               <p>By the act of union, for uniting the two kingdoms into one, anno 1707, the filth year of Queen Anne, by the name of Great Britain, it was enacted, that the Preſbyterian church-government is to remain eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scotland; but by the 10th of Anne, cap. 7, that it ſhall be lawful for thoſe of the Epiſcopal communion in Scotland, to aſſemble for divine worſhip, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by paſtors ordained by Proteſtant Biſhops,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0010800104:73"/>without diſturbance, except in pariſh-churches: ſuch paſtors of the epiſcopal perſuaſion to exhibit their orders at the quarter-ſeſſions of the peace, and the ſame to be regiſtered, paying one ſhilling One hundred pounds penalty to be levied on any diſturber of their congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: their paſtors to baptize and marry, provided the chriſtenings be regiſtered, and banns three times publiſhed in the Epiſcopal congregation. No pain or forfeiture to be incurred by any perſon, on any excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by the church-judicatories in Scotland. Miniſters are to pray for the royal family. By cap. 12. patrons of churches, &amp;c. are reſtored to their right of preſentation. By act 5 Geo. I. cap. 29, proviſion was made for rendering more effectual the laws ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the oaths for the ſecurity of the government to be taken by miniſters and preachers in churches and meeting houſes in Scotland: and by act 9 Geo. I. cap. 24, Papiſts and Nonjurors are obliged to regiſter their eſtates. Theſe are the principal proviſions made ſince the union, relative to religious affairs in Scotland, where, under the mild and auſpicious ſway of the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious houſe of Hanover, the church has long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that repoſe it in vain ſought and ſtruggled for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many of their predeceſſors, and all perſecution for conſcience ſake is laid aſide. With religious and civil liberty, learning, arts, and ſciences flouriſh, politeneſs and civility every where reign, and her clergy and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities have abounded with elegant and fine writers, in every branch of literature, who have done credit to humanity, and ſpread the reputation of their country to the remoteſt parts of the world.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, that ſome internal differences and diviſions have happened in the church of Scotland, from the eſtabliſhed judicatories of which a <hi>Seceſſion</hi> has taken place; the hiſtory of which, and the ſchiſms in that ſeceſſion, I ſhall now give (before I enter upon my account of the doctrine and diſcipline of that church) excellently drawn up by a reverend divine of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0010800104:74"/>Haddington, who has therein preſerved a Chriſtian temper, and a laudable moderation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seceſſion</hi> from the eſtabliſhed judicatories of the church of Scotland took place, in conſequence of a continued courſe of offences to the ſtrict party therein. Theſe, like their anceſtors, zealouſly adhered to the Weſtminſter confeſſion of faith, catechiſm and form of Preſbyterian church-government; they maintaining the binding obligation of the Scots covenant, and of the ſolemn league and covenant of the three nations; they allowed the civil magiſtrate a ſovereignty over all church-members in all civil cauſes, but refuſed that he had any ſpiritual headſhip over her doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline or government; hence they conceived no ſmall diſguſt at their clergy for ſo tamely yielding to the diſſolution or prorogation of their general aſſembly by King William and Queen Anne; they were exceedingly grieved with the Scots parliament for conſenting that the perpetual eſtabliſhment of prelacy in England ſhould be an eſſential condition of the union between the two kingdoms, and afterwards with the Britiſh for reſtoring the power of patrons in the ſettlement of miniſters; the former accounted a moſt ſinful burying of the ſolemn league, whereby the Scots not only ſwore againſt prelacy themſelves, but alſo to endeavour the reformation of England from it; the latter they deteſted, as annexing the ſpiritual privileges of the church to civil rights, as if Chriſt's kingdom were of this world; as tending to place the management of the church in the hands of Chriſt's enemies; as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a door for ſimoniacal pactions between the patron and preſentee, and for filling the church with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent, naughty and erroneous miniſtry: but as the Preſbyterian clergy remonſtrated againſt this procedure of the parliament, together with their act for tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſorts of opinions except popery and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, the people could not take offence at them on theſe accounts. It was otherwiſe in the affair of the act
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0010800104:75"/>impoſing the abjuration oath upon the clergy: the ſtrict Preſbyterians, whether miniſters or people, heartily deteſted Popery and the Pretender for its ſake; but obſerving that this oath was extended to Preſbyterian miniſters by Jacobitiſh influence, that it was originally calculated for the maintenance of the Engliſh church as well as ſtate; that it referred to two Engliſh acts of parliament, requiring the ſovereign to be of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal communion; that it implied an approbation of the union ſettlement, and conſequently of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſinful term thereof; that ſome of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were ambiguous and hard to be underſtood; that though it was ſuſpected few miniſters would have taken it but for fear of the penalty, yet they were obliged therein to ſwear they took it heartily and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. For theſe and the like reaſons, many truly loyal, ſenſible, and godly miniſters declined taking it; and not a few as loyal people declined hearing thoſe who took it eſpecially where they had acceſs to hear ſuch as did not. Scarce was this woful re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ding of the church commenced, when Mr. John Simſon, Profeſſor of Divinty at Glaſgow, being by Mr. James Webſter, miniſter at Edinburgh, proceſſed for error before the general aſſembly, did in his defence and other papers maintain, that Heathens have an implicit diſcovery of redemption through Chriſt; that if they or others do with natural ſeriouſneſs uſe the means of happineſs God hath given them, they ſhall certainly obtain ſaving grace and laſting felicity; that all infants are formed as holy and free of ſin as Adam was, and dying in non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhall probably be ſaved; that no proper covenant of works was made with Adam as the repreſentative of his poſterity; that our own happineſs ought to be our chief end and motive in glorifying God; that there is no immediate divine pre-courſe with the actions of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures; and that there will be no ſinning in hell after the laſt judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0010800104:76"/>After tedious altercations at that and ſome former meetings, the aſſembly of 1717 found theſe notions no more than opinions not neceſſary to be taught in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, opinions not evidently founded upon ſcripture, and ſome of them tending to attribute too much to natural reaſon and the power of corrupt nature; and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited him and all others to uſe ſuch expreſſions, or teach ſuch poſitions for the future. But the very ſame day they declared the following poſition, viz "It is unſound to teach that we muſt forſake our ſin in order to come to Chriſt, and inſtating us in covenant with God," moſt unſound and deteſtable; and thus indirectly declared, that we ought and are able to forſake and ſave ourſelves from the reign and practice of our ſin, before we come to Jeſus, the alone Saviour from it. To ſtop the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of this and other legal doctrines, a new edition of that truly valuable Engliſh book, intitled, <hi>The marrow of modern divinity,</hi> was publiſhed, with a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory preface, by Mr. James Hog, one of the holieſt miniſters in the kingdom. This book, after it had paſſed for about eighty years with conſiderable reputation and eſteem among moſt of the truly ſerious perſons who read it, was attacked with great warmth by the general aſſembly of 1720; and though it is ſhrewdly ſuſpected the greater part of the members had never peruſed it, an act was made, charging all miniſters in connection with them to warn their people againſt reading it.— In their attack upon this book, the aſſembly plainly condemned the offering of Chriſt as a Saviour to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as ſuch, and the aſſerting that believers are wholly delivered from the law as a covenant of works: they maintained that holineſs is a federal or conditional means of obtaining eternal happineſs; and that ſlaviſh fear of endleſs miſery, and legal hope of future felicity, ought to influence the ſaints in their ſtudy of goſpel holineſs: theſe almoſt entirely ſcriptural expreſſions, "That believers are not under the law, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin; that the Lord can ſee no ſin in them, nor be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0010800104:77"/>angry with them for ſin," they declared Antinomian paradoxes; and condemned, the diſtinguiſhing between the law as a covenant of works, and as a binding rule of obedience in the hand of a Mediator, in order to explain them: Meſſ. Thomas Boſton, Ebenezer and Ralph Erſkines, with nine others, remonſtrated againſt this conduct: theſe twelve repreſenters had their own ſhare of trouble from the judicatories; the commiſſion poſed them with twelve queſtions relative to the affair in diſpute, in the anſwers to which they ſet ſeveral goſpel truths in a very clear light. The aſſembly of 1722 took the matter into further conſideration, and made an act explaining and confirming the acts of 1720: this the repreſenters proteſted againſt as ſtill injurious to the truths of the goſpel, though it muſt be owned it was not near ſo groſs as thoſe of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of 1720. To avoid even the moſt diſtant approaches towards favouring the condemned ſentiments or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>the marrow,</hi> many of the Scots clergy ſeemed now to become more legal in their doctrine than ever, which tempted multitudes of ſerious Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to crowd to hear the repreſenters, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding diſtinguiſhed holineſs in practice, and a zealous warmth in recommending it to their hearers, were exceedingly reproached as Antinomian encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a licentious life.—It is probable theſe twelve miniſters harraſſment and reproach had been more laſting, had not a rumour ſpread, in the end of 1725, that Mr. John Simſon above-mentioned had not only continued to teach his former errors contrary to the prohibition of the aſſembly, but had taught that Jeſus Chriſt is not neceſſarily exiſtent; that the perſons of the Godhead are not the very ſame in ſubſtance; that neceſſary exiſtence, ſupreme deity and being the only true God, may be taken for the perſonal property of the Father, and ſo not belonging to the Son and Holy Ghoſt. The teaching of his former errors was fully proved, but nothing was done to him upon that account: his teaching the above Arian tenets was alſo ſufficiently
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0010800104:78"/>manifeſted; but he, giving in declarations of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on theſe heads in orthodox language, and after much tergiverſation, profeſſing ſorrow for ſome of the offenſive expreſſions proved againſt him; the aſſembly of 1728 ſuſpended him from the exerciſe of all eccleſiaſtic power and function till another general aſſembly ſhould think fit to take off this ſentence. The aſſembly of 1729 further declared that it was not fit to intruſt him any more with training up of young men for the holy miniſtry: multitudes were offended he was ſo ſlightly cenſured. During this proceſs paſtors began to be violently obtruded upon reclaiming congregations; and the aſſembly of 1730 enacted, that no proteſts nor diſſents ſhould be recorded in their minutes; againſt which, and other corruptions, about forty miniſters, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred elders and private Chriſtians, gave in a warm remonſtrance, and craved the aſſembly would aſſert the truth, in direct oppoſition to Mr. Simſon's errors. The aſſembly of 1732 refuſed to hear theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, and, contrary to inſtructions from the far greater part of the Preſbyteries who ſent any, enacted, that Proteſtant heritors, whether prelatic Jacobites or not, and elders, ſhould be the only voters in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goſpel miniſters: the aſſembly of 1733 diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Preſbytery of Dunfermline, under pain of the higheſt cenſure, to adminiſter ſealing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to thoſe whoſe conſciences could not ſubmit to the miniſtry of paſtors violently impoſed upon them. Mean while Mr. Ebenezer Erſkine above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, having, in his ſermon before the ſynod at Perth, October 1732, teſtified againſt the act of the laſt aſſembly relative to the choice of miniſters, and having decried patronage and ſome other prevalent corruptions, the ſynod, after three days diſpute, appointed him to be rebuked at their bar, for the matter and manner of his conduct: twelve miniſters and two elders diſſented: himſelf appealed to the aſſembly in 1733, but received no redreſs: that ſupreme judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ordered him to be rebuked at the bar. Conceiving
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0010800104:79"/>that the truths of God he had in his ſermon ſupported, were hereby injured, he proteſted that he could not, without violating his conſcience, ſubmit to this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Meſſ. William Wilſon, Alexander Moncrief, and James Fiſher, for the exoneration of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, proteſted againſt the prevailing courſe of defection. Without allowing theſe four brethren to attempt a defence of their conduct, the aſſembly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their commiſſion to proceed againſt them by ſuſpenſion, and higher cenſure, if they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract their proteſt, and profeſs their ſorrow for taking it. When the commiſſion met in Auguſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting brethren were hardly allowed to declare their mind; and becauſe they continued adhering to their proteſt, they were ſuſpended from the exerciſe of their miniſtry. The next meeting of the commiſſion, in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, by their Moderator's caſting vote, ſuſpended them alſo from their miniſtration in their reſpective congregations. Hereupon theſe brethren declared a ſeceſſion, not from the conſtitution of the Scots church, but from the prevailing party in her judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; and, that they might regularly adhere to their principles, and afford relief to thoſe people that were oppreſſed with intruſion of paſtors, they conſtituted themſelves into an eccleſiaſtic court, which they called the Aſſociate Preſbytery. Their minutes ſhew, that, quickly after their erection, Meſſ. Wilſon and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crief drew up a paper, intitled, "A teſtimony to the doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline, and government of the church of Scotland" This paper was judicially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and approved in their meetings at Colfargy and Dunfermline, and in it they exhibit their reaſons of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the prevailing party in the judicatories of the eſtabliſhed church, viz. 1. That that party were breaking down the Preſbyterian conſtitution of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government, by their trampling upon and making deciſions quite contrary to the barrier acts and rules which had been enacted by the Scots church in her
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0010800104:80"/>pureſt times, for aſcertaining due deliberation in the framing of ſtanding laws and general rules; by their exerciſing a lordly tyranny over men's conſciences, in impowering heritors and elders to impoſe upon Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians what ſpiritual guides they pleaſed; by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting violent intruſion of miniſters as opportunity permitted; by their cenſuring and ejecting miniſters from their congregations, merely for proteſting againſt a ſinful act of aſſembly; by threatening the higheſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to ſuch as ſhould adminiſter baptiſm or the Lord's ſupper to thoſe who could not in conſcience ſubmit to the miniſtry of intruders, and allowing the commiſſion to take the Preſbytery's power in ſettlement of miniſters, if theſe Preſbyteries refuſed to promote the violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of miniſters upon reclaiming congregations. 2. That they were purſuing ſuch methods as tended to corrupt the doctrine contained in their confeſſion of faith, in ſo eaſily diſmiſſing Profeſſor Simſon's proceſs, and refuſing to aſſert the truth, in oppoſition to his various errors: in careſſing Mr. Campbell, Profeſſor of Church Hiſtory at St. Andrew's, notwithſtanding his ridiculing practical goodneſs as enthuſiaſm, and his declaring that ſelf-love is the chief motive and ſtandard of all virtuous and religious actions; that the being of God and immortality of the ſoul cannot be known by the mere light of nature; and yet the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are a certain and ſufficient rule to direct rational minds to happineſs, and our obſerving them the great means of our real and laſting felicity: and finally, in their permitting or encouraging preachers to entertain their hearers with dry harangues of almoſt mere Heathen morality, inſtead of the goſpel of Chriſt. 3. That they were impoſing upon miniſters, as a term of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the ſinful breaking of their ordination-vows, by neglecting all proper oppoſition to the prevailing courſe of apoſtacy from the doctrine, worſhip, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline of the Scots church. 4. That they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0010800104:81"/>were continuing obſtinate in their evil ways, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all ordinary means uſed to recal them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in this teſtimony, theſe four brethren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their adherence to their ordination-vows, and to the ſtandards of the mother church; and that they intended to hold eccleſiaſtic communion with all ſuch of her miniſters and members as oppoſed the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned courſe of backſliding, as they ſhould have opportunity.</p>
               <p>The ſtrict party of the Scots church having vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly exerted themſelves in the choice of members, the aſſembly of 1734 was very different from ſeveral of the preceding: ſundry corrupt courſes were checked; the ſeceding brethren were appointed to be reponed to their charges; but as the act of aſſembly repreſented this as done without condemning the act of aſſembly of 1733, or the conduct of their commiſſion, theſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren reckoned the truths that ſuffered along with them not duly vindicated, and therefore declined joining the eſtabliſhed judicatories on that footing, and publiſhed the reaſons of their conduct: however, they waited about two years and a half, looking and wiſhing for an opportunity of returning to the judicatories, during which time they kept their meetings of Preſbytery for almoſt nothing but prayer and conference: at length, obſerving the eſtabliſhed judicatories faſt returning to, or proceeding in their fore-mentioned corruptions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſions promoted, Profeſſor Campbell diſmiſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cenſure, and his error concerning ſelf-love inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently approved by the general aſſembly: her own excellent act againſt violent ſettlements, and another for orthodox preaching, generally diſregarded, they began to preach to thoſe oppreſſed Chriſtians who peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for it, and appointed Mr. Wilſon, one of their number, to train up ſtudents for the holy miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Mean while, in the beginning of 1737, Meſſ. Ralph Erſkine and Thomas Mair joined them, declaring, that they joined them not as different from, but as a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0010800104:82"/>part of the church of Scotland, witneſſing againſt the corruption of the prevailing party in her eſtabliſhed judicatories; that they intended no withdrawment from ſuch godly miniſters as were groaning under and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the then courſe of backſliding; and that they propoſed to return to the eſtabliſhed judicatories whenever they ſhould return to their duty.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Aſſociate Preſbytery publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecond teſtimony, calculated not to enumerate the cauſes of Seceſſion, but to repreſent the grounds of the Lord's anger againſt the generation; to approve former reformations, to condemn the ſteps of defection from it, and the moſt prevalent errors of the times, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the truth in oppoſition thereto. In this paper they particularly rehearſed and condemned the principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of church and ſtate between 1650 and 1737: they expreſsly condemned the errors of Meſſ. Simſon and Campbell, and ſhewed them to be contrary to the word of God, and to the Weſtminſter confeſſion of faith and catechiſms: they ſolemnly aſſerted, that the Old and New Teſtament are not only a ſufficient and principal, but the ONLY rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy God: that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſupreme, only true, and neceſſarily exiſtent God, of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with his eternal Father: that God from eternity decreed all things merely according to the counſel of his will, and elected his people to everlaſting life, without any regard to their good works as the motive or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his choice: that God entered into a covenant of works with Adam as the repreſentative of all his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed: that, in conſequence of the breach of this covenant, all men are conceived and born in ſin, are by nature children of wrath, and can do nothing ſpiritually good: that tho' there be no neceſſary connexion between natural ſeriouſneſs and our obtaining of ſaving grace; yet it is the duty of all unregenerate perſons ſeriouſly to attend goſpel ordinances, whether public, private or ſecret, as the means whereby God conveys his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0010800104:83"/>influence: that the light of nature is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guide fallen men to true or laſting happineſs: that Chriſt aſſumed our nature, is very God and very man in two diſtinct natures, and one perſon for ever: that he, as our ſurety, undertook for all the elect, and gave to the law and juſtice of God whatever obedience and ſatisfaction they could require of us: that his righteouſneſs imputed to us; is the ONLY foundation of our pardon, acceptance with God, and title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and not any thing wrought in or done by us: that want of conformity to God's law, in heart or life, is truly and properly ſin: that ſinning and ſuffering will be the miſery of the damned in hell thro' eternity: that all believers in Chriſt are fully delivered from the moral law as a covenant of works, ſo as to be thereby neither juſtified nor condemned, but are for ever under it as a binding rule of obedience given by Jehovah the Creator and Redeemer of men: that God needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from, nor can be profited by any creature, and therefore rewards their good actions entirely of his own free will and abſolutely gracious bounty: that not ſelf-intereſt or pleaſure, but the holy law of God, is the ſupreme and only ſtandard of all religious and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions: that not ſelf-love, but a view of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies of God, as revealed in Chriſt, and a regard to his authority, is the leading motive of our love and obedience to him: that no believer can ever totally fall from a ſtate of grace, nor did Chriſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, while he lay in the grave, look upon him as a downright impoſtor: that Chriſt <hi>alone</hi> is King and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead of his church; to him <hi>alone</hi> it belongs to give her laws, ordinances, and officers; to him <hi>alone</hi> her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are ſubject in their ſpiritual adminiſtrations: that he hath warranted them to hold general aſſemblies, and other church judicatories, as often as neceſſary: that he hath appointed the Preſbyterian form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and no other, to continue in his church till the end of time: that Chriſt having in his word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0010800104:84"/>a government in his church, diſtinct from, and not ſubordinate to the civil magiſtrate, he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted it not to all church-members, but only to her office-bearers, whoſe power is entirely ſubordinate to the laws declared in his word: that theſe officers ought to be ſet over congregations by the call and conſent of the majority of ſuch therein as are admitted to full communion with the church in all her ſealing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, no perſon's vote being preferred upon any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account. Along with theſe aſſertory declarations of their belief, they condemned and profeſſed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the contrary errors; and finally declared their hearty adherence to the Weſtminſter confeſſion of faith, catechiſms, directory for worſhip, and form of church-government, and to the national covenant of Scotland, as explained to abjure Prelacy and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Perth, and to the ſolemn league and covenant of the three kingdoms, and to all acts of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or other teſtimonies, tending to promote or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their anceſtors covenanted work of reformation; and particularly to their own repreſentations to the commiſſion of the general aſſembly in 1733, their firſt teſtimony, and their reaſons of not acceding to the judicatories of the eſtabliſhed church.</p>
               <p>Though this teſtimony was not intended for a new ſtandard, but as an open appearance in favour of thoſe that had been long acknowledged by the nation; yet perſons at their acceſſion to, or joining with the Sece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding miniſters, did commonly profeſs their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as far as they underſtood it: but that the preſbytery did not tyrannically require ſuch as joined them to believe the certainty of the various narratives of fact contained therein, is fully evident; Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the principal defender of the Seceding cauſe, boldly avers, that Mr. Currie his antagoniſt, in charging it with twenty-four miſtakes reſpecting hiſtorical facts, did not affect its proper ſubſtance, but merely wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled about circumſtances; and that the plain meaning
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0010800104:85"/>of acceders approving this teſtimony, was their ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their conjunction with the Aſſociate Preſbytery, in the ſame confeſſion of the truths of God held forth from his word in our received ſtandards of doctrine, worſhip, diſcipline, and government.</p>
               <p>Now nothing can be more certain, that neither the word of God, nor ſtandards of the Scots church, but acts of parliament, acts of aſſembly, and other like fallible vouchers, hold forth the hiſtorical aſſertions of that paper.</p>
               <p>Not long had this teſtimony been publiſhed, when multitudes of private Chriſtians, a good number of elders, and two more miniſters, being offended with the growth of apoſtacy above-mentioned, and anew grieved with a great part of the eſtabliſhed clergy, for publickly rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uting themſelves judges of miniſters fitneſs to ſit in her courts, and threatening eccleſiaſtic penalties for diſobedience to their civil authority, did join the Aſſociate Preſbytery upon the footing of it. Now many from different corners of the land petitioned this preſbytery for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; their requeſts were deliberately granted: the Seceding miniſters preached, and eſpecially held faſts, in moſt corners of the ſouth part of the country.</p>
               <p>The plainneſs of this ſecond teſtimony, and the crowding of the common people after the authors of it, mightily provoked the managers in the eſtabliſhed judicatories: the Seceding miniſters were libelled, and cited before the aſſembly of 1739. When they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the aſſembly declared their willingneſs to drop the libel, overlook every thing foregoing, and receive them with open arms into all manner of church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: but theſe aſſociate brethren, conſidering that the aſſembly conſiſted chiefly of intruders, and others deeply guilty of the growing defection, declined her
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0010800104:86"/>authority, as a not rightly conſtituted court of Chriſt. This daring attack, added to the former provocation, mightily chagrined the managers; wherefore the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in 1740, without pretending to find theſe miniſters guilty of error in doctrine, or immorality in practice, depoſed them from being miniſters of the church of Scotland. This ſentence occaſioned a mighty run of the common people after the Seceding brethren; but as their followers increaſed, ſo did their trials. Sundry, if not moſt of theſe miniſters, had ere now believed, that a magiſtrate has only power to appoint faſts and thankſgivings, with the diets and cauſes thereof, in extraordinary caſes, and where he has not acceſs to conſult with a church that he judges rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted: but ſome of their people, who had acceded to them, <hi>now</hi> prompted them to determine, Whether it was lawful for them to obſerve a faſt on the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King for that effect? In a <hi>pro re nata</hi> meeting of preſbytery, deſigned for other buſineſs, and while 14 out of 22 members were <hi>abſent,</hi> this queſtion was irregularly hawled in by Meſſ. Alexander Moncrief, Thomas Nairn, and Thomas Mair; and becauſe they judged the eſtabliſhed church had practically given up their power of appointing faſts and thankſgivings into the hand of the Sovereign, they carried it by, I think, one vote, that the Seceders obſerving faſts on theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, was a ſinful connivance at the King's exerciſing a ſpiritual headſhip over the church. The deep ſilence, concerning this matter, in their after confeſſion of ſins, prefixed to their covenant-bond, indeed plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that this deciſion was never generally approved by the Seceding clergy: but their people being once, many of them, tinctured with the above notion, they ſeldom found it for edification to obſerve faſts or thankſgivings on the days appointed for that end by the civil magiſtrate: nevertheleſs, on theſe occaſions, they uſed to recommend private faſting, or to forbear giving offence with public labour; ſo that except a few
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0010800104:87"/>forward and leſs judicious perſons, it may be juſtly averred, that the Seceders gave as little open offence to the government on that head as moſt in the nation, who pretended to be zealous obſervers of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's faſts.</p>
               <p>By Mr. Whitfield's miſſives to Mr Ralph Erſkine, and other like circumſtances, ſeveral of the Seceding brethren had conceived a very favourable opinion of him; but finding, upon converſe with him, that he decried all particular forms of church government as a mere human device, and being exceedingly offended with his printed enthuſiaſtic account of God's dealing with his ſoul, they turned their favour into warm op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. In 1742, and ſome following years, a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing commotion in the ſouls and bodies of men, while they attended ſermon, happened at Cambuſlang, near Glaſgow, and other places: this Mr. Whitfield's admirers extolled as a wonderful work of the Spirit of God; but the Seceders, tho' they could not deny that the lives of many were, for the preſent, thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that ſome divine influence might attend the truths there delivered; yet, becauſe of the bodily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, diſorderly noiſe, imaginary views of Chriſt, averſion at a covenanted work of reformation, nauſeous boaſting, and other irregularities attending it, they decried it as in a great meaſure deluſive. In the warm contention upon ſo critical a topic, no doubt both parties ſometimes run into extremes, and became ſtumbling blocks to one another: however, the return of multitudes of the ſubjects of the ſurpriſing influence to their wonted courſes, mightily confirmed the Sece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in their ſentiment.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Seceding body had another trial from among themſelves: it was their earneſt deſire and prayer to God, to make our Sovereign King George, and every ſubordinate magiſtrate, zealous friends to a covenanted work of reformation; but they were firmly perſuaded, that difference in religion deprives
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0010800104:88"/>no civil ruler of his juſt power and authority; they openly teſtified againſt Mr. M'Milian's party, and others that thought otherwiſe: not a few of them bore arms againſt the Pretender; not one of them can be charged with appearing on his ſide: their miniſters often debarred from the Lord's table ſuch as denied the lawful authority of our preſent government, in all things civil; and they formally excommunicated ſome few of their followers that preſumed to do ſo.</p>
               <p>In 1742, Mr. Thomas Nairn, a perſon too volatile for a witneſſing miniſter, took it into his head to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that none but a Preſbyterian and covenanted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could be rightful Sovereign of this realm: his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated brethren quickly oppoſed him with great vigour; proceeded to cenſure him; publiſhed a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial declaration, wherein they ſhewed, from the word of God, our ſtandards and covenants, that it is the duty of the whole nation to obey the preſent civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in all things lawful, for conſcience ſake</p>
               <p>After about ſeven years deliberation, the Aſſociate Preſbytery agreed upon the form of a bond of public covenanting with God; and, in December 1743, themſelves began to enter into it. Next year their act on this head was publiſhed, together with another, vindicating the doctrine of God's free grace from the injury done it by the general aſſemblies of 1720 and 1722 above-mentioned. The form of the Seceders co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had been ſhort, and moſtly plain, had it not reduplicated upon a long confeſſion of ſins, that it is to be feared few of their people could fully know the import and certainty of: not a few, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the preſbytery's act, declaring, that the ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this bond ſhould be the term of miniſterial and Chriſtian communion with them. It was thought very unreaſonable, that a perſon of an eminently holy life, and zealouſly attached to all the truths of God, to the Scots ſtandards and covenants, ſhould be excluded from the ſeals of God's covenant, merely becauſe he could
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0010800104:89"/>not underſtand the meaning or certainty of ſome things in this bond, and the acknowledgment of ſins prefixed to it; or would not ſwear to what he underſtood not. Many of the Seceding clergy were afterwards ſenſible that this act was ſinful; nor do I know that ever the moſt zealous acted up to the tenor of it, with reſpect to their people.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1745, the Aſſociate Preſbytery was ſo far increaſed, that they divided themſelves into three preſbyteries, under one ſynod. Soon after which, the Lord, to puniſh their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his cauſe, gave them up to angry contentions, and an unprecedented breach. Tho' in many of their public papers they had ſolemnly declared their adherence to the ordination-vows uſed, and conſequently to the religion profeſſed in the eſtabliſhed church; tho' in their principles concerning magiſtracy, publiſhed in the year 1743, p. 50, they had judicially declared their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God that their own religion had ſuch ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the preſent civil government, as no nation on earth enjoyed the like: yet at the very firſt meeting of their Aſſociate Synod, they began warmly to debate, <hi>whether it was lawful for Seceders to ſwear that clauſe in ſome Scots burgeſs-oaths,</hi> viz. <hi>I profeſs and allow with my heart the true religion preſently profeſſed within this realm, and authoriſed by the laws thereof; I ſhall abide at and defend the ſame to my life's end, renouncing the Roman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion called Papiſtry.</hi> Meſſ. Ebenezer and Ralph Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkines, James Fiſher, and others, maintained, that ſince it was the true, the divine religion itſelf, profeſſed and ſettled in Scotland, and not the human and faulty man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of profeſſing or ſettling it, that was ſworn to in theſe oaths: that ſince, in their ſeceſſion, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to ſet up a new religion, but to cleave more cloſely to that whereinto they had been baptiſed: that ſince in their teſtimonies they had eſpouſed the very ſame ſtandards with the eſtabliſhed church, had frequently and ſolemnly declared their adherence to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0010800104:90"/>ordination-vows, ſundry of them had taken therein, and whereby they were engaged to the religion, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, worſhip, diſcipline and government profeſſed and ſettled in the land: that ſince, tho' in their public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers they had quarrelled with the manner in which the true religion is preſently profeſſed and ſettled in the realm, and teſtified againſt the various corruptions of church and ſtate; yet they had been ſo far from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with the true religion profeſſed and ſettled, that no more than two years before they had judicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the religion ſecured by the preſent civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be their own; and therefore could not, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the moſt glaring ſelf contradiction,</hi> prohibit the ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the above clauſe, as in itſelf ſinful, for thoſe of their way. Meſſ. Alexander M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ncrief, Thomas Mair, Adam Gib, and others, comended, that Seceders ſwearing of this clauſe was exceeding ſinful, and a giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the whole of their teſtimony; becauſe, ſaid they, ſwearing to the true religion preſently profeſſed and authoriſed in this realm, imports a ſwearing to it as preſently profeſſed and ſettled, and ſo an approving by oath of all the corrupt acts of church and ſtate. After much hot contention, thoſe who defended the burgeſs-oath, and who now began to be called Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, offered, for the ſake of peace, to agree to an act forbidding Seceders to ſwear the ſaid clauſe, as inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in the preſent circumſtances. This peaceful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal the Antiburghers refuſed, as altogether inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and, in a pretty thin meeting of ſyned, Apr. 9, 1746, puſhed and carried a vote, condemning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſwearing of the above religious clauſe by Seceders, as ſinful, and inconſiſtent with their teſtimony and bond for renewing the covenants. Part of the Burgher miniſters and elders proteſted againſt this ſentence; but the Antiburghers anſwers to their reaſons of proteſt, not being ready, as they ought, againſt next meeting of ſynod, and ſome of the more zealous having in the mean time publickly debarred the defenders of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs-oath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0010800104:91"/>from the Lord's table, a new queſtion was introduced, Whether the above ſentence relative to the religious clauſe of ſome burgeſs-oaths ſhould be a term of miniſterial and Chriſtian communion? After much warm altercation at two meetings, and a diſſent and proteſtation of the Antiburghers againſt putting this queſtion, it was voted, and carried, that the ſaid ſentence ſhould not be a term of miniſterial or Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, at leaſt till the affair ſhould be deliberately conſidered in preſbyteries and ſeſſions, their mind ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and further means uſed, by prayer and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for ſeeing eye to eye in the truth. No ſooner was this ſentence carried, than Mr. Thomas Mair, a zealous Antiburgher, declared and proteſted, that thereby his oppoſers had forfeited all ſynodical power, and that the lawful authority of the Aſſociate Synod was devolved upon a conſtituted meeting of his party, and of ſuch as ſhould cleave to them; all whom he called to meet next day in Mr. Gib's houſe for that effect; and then, with twenty-two others, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either moderator or clerk, withdrew from thirty-two or thirty-three of their brethren, conſtituted in Chriſt's name, and with their moderator and clerk attending them. The day following, the Burghers aſſembled and conſtituted ſynod in the ordinary place: but the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers conſtituted themſelves into another ſynod in Mr. Gib's houſe, and aſſerted themſelves ſole judges of their own anſwers, diſſents and proteſts; enacted, that the Burgher miniſters had forfeited all power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their office; and that no Seceding preſbytery or ſeſſion, not conſtituted in ſubordination to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meeting, could be a lawful court of Chriſt. This act was the baſis of their next meetings of preſbytery; hence the Antiburghers of the preſbytery of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh deſerted their appointed place of next meeting, and took another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0010800104:92"/>not ſubmit to their above conſtitution of ſynod. Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was the ſtumbling and alienation of affection that enſued among the people; multitudes were perplexed how to ſide themſelves; and no doubt many did it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely by gueſs. To remedy this awful confuſion, the Burgher clergy wrote twice to their brethren that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them, earneſtly begging a meeting for prayer and conference, in order to their uniting in the Lord's cauſe. The Antiburghers, whether from unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to convince the Burghers of the ſins they laid to their charge, or from conſciouſneſs that they had not ſufficient arguments for that end, or from ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent view; returned no other anſwer, than that they could not, conſiſtently with their teſtimony, comply with any ſuch propoſal; and that their brethren's only way for peace was to preſent themſelves penitent pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels at their bar. The Burghers could not in conſcience ſubmit to their brethren's conſtitution of ſynod. None of them therefore appeared at their bar, except Mr. Hutton, who did it for no other purpoſe than to read a formidable attack upon the conſtitution of their court, which to this moment has received no proper refutation. The Burghers continued exerciſing their miniſtry, and holding their judicatories as formerly: they even made an act, declaring the Antiburgher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in Mr. Gib's houſe void and null, everſive of preſbytery, and contrary to ſcripture and reaſon: For theſe, and other above-mentioned inſtances of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Antiburghers depoſed, excommunicated, and delivered them over to Satan. Theſe ſentences had no effect: the Meſſ. Erſkines, and other Burghers, lived as holily, preached as edifyingly, and died as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, as any of their oppoſers. The Antiburghers having proceeded two years in thus cenſuring their brethren, were obliged to confeſs, that all along them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had been lying under ſcandal with reſpect to partaking with their brethren in their ſin; and, at a meeting of ſynod, purged one another from it by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial

Nothing tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted ſince, on either ſide, deſerves a place in a general hiſtory of religion: it remains briefly to repreſent the preſent agreement and difference of the two parties.

Which party have the greateſt number of followers, I know not; but the Antiburghers having the teacher of philoſophy and profeſſor of divinity on their ſide at the breach, then carried off almoſt all the ſtudents, and to this day have the greateſt number of miniſters; tho' even here the Burghers ſeem to gain ground. Both parties agree in public profeſſion of acherence to the ſcriptures, as the only rule of ſaith and practice; and to the confeſſion of faith, catechiſms, form of church-government, and public covenants, of their Preſbyterian anceſtors. Both, I hope, preach the goſpel of Chriſt in purity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to commit the miniſtry to faithful men. I heir form of worſhip is much the ſame with that of their mother-church: with both, miniſters endeavour pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to catechiſe, and privately to viſit, their congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations once a-year, without reſpect of perſons; both deteſt and avoid private b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither party allow themſelves to admit to the ſacraments any but ſuch as have ſome viſible appearance of ſaintſhip: Groſs ignorance of the Chriſtian ſaith, neglect of the worſhip of God in ſecret or in families, drunkenneſs, ſwearing in ordinary converſation, even tho' it be in a paſſion, idleneſs, or unneceſſary travelling or labouring on the Sabbath, playing at cards and dice, ſmuggling of goods, lying, reviling, apparent hatred of others, diſhoneſty, obſcene language, fornication, and the like, are with both reckoned ſcandalous, and ſufficient reaſon for ſuſpending a perſon from the ſacraments. With reſpect to difference, none can be admitted to the ſacraments by the Antiburghers, except he at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly declare his perſuaſion that it is very ſinful for Seceders to ſwear the above-mentioned clauſe of ſome burgeſs-oaths: they contend, that the conſtitution of the Scots revolution church is Eraſtian, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be lawfully joined with: they aver that their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is different from that of the eſtabliſhed church, but have not hitherto declared what divine truth they hold that is not comprehended in her public ſtandards: they ſeem to equal, if not ſometimes prefer, the ſecond teſtimony above-mentioned, to the confeſſion of faith, and other ſtandards of their mother church, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while renounce the ordination-vows, together with ſuch parts of the firſt teſtimony and repreſentations adhered to in it, as approve of the religion at preſent profeſſed in the realm. Tho', in their preſent form of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-vows, they plainly approve of that declaration of principles concerning the civil magiſtrate, in which it is declared that their own religion has unmatched ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the preſent civil government; yet they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their brethren, becauſe they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that every one ſhould be excluded from miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and Chriſtian communion with them, who believed it lawful to ſwear to profeſs and abide in the religion at preſent authoriſed by the civil government: they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

Though they declared the Antiburghers conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Mr. Gib's houſe null and void, and maintained their brethren's above-mentioned cenſuring of them, and their frequent faſting and prayer for God's ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, an almoſt unmatched profanation of the name of Chriſt; yet they could not ſee it warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from ſcripture to proceed to cenſure their brethren, while there was no appearance of its tending to the general edification. They heartily approve of publickly covenanting, when ſeaſonable, and done in truth, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſs: they conſtantly maintain the continued obligation of their anceſtors covenants; and at ordinations, and on other occaſions, ſolemnly declare their adherence to them: but finding from ſcripture that public covenanting is not a ſtanding but occaſional duty; that it neither took place in the reign of David nor Solomon, thoſe religious Kings, who together reigned eighty years over Iſrael, nor appears to have been ever recommended by the Apoſtles as a preſent duty for their hearers; that it is only to be done with knowledge and underſtanding; and that it is better not to vow, than to vow and not pay by a tender and holy practice; and fearing that the preſent broken ſtate of the church, when the godly are ſo divided, may not be altogether proper for it; finding that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome inadvertent miſtakes, the confeſſion of ſins, publiſhed in 1744, and now uſed by the Antiburghers, is ſuch as they could not hope to make the twentieth

                  <p>Scotland is divided into ſixty-nine preſbyteries, each conſiſting of from twelve to twenty-four contiguous pariſhes: the miniſters of theſe pariſhes, with one ruling elder, choſen half-yearly at every kirk-ſeſſion, compoſe a preſbytery. They meet in the principal town, from which they are denominated, and chuſe their Moderator, who muſt be a miniſter, half-yearly: from theſe preſbyteries appeals lye to provincial ſynods, which are compoſed of ſeveral adjacent preſbyteries, two, three, four, or eight. There are fifteen provincial ſynods in all: the members are, a miniſter and a ruling elder out of every pariſh. Theſe ſynods meet twice
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0010800104:98"/>a year, at the principal town of its bounds. They chuſe a Moderator, who is their Prolocutor. The acts of the ſynods are ſubject to the review of the general aſſembly, which is the laſt reſort of the kirk of Scotland.</p>

                  <p>The general aſſembly meets once a year, in the month of May, and is opened and adjourned by the King's Royal Commiſſioner, appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">But, agreeable to their old maxims, the general aſſembly own no ſpiritual headſhip in the civil power, and in 1746 they met be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the High Commiſſioner's commiſſion came down, and directly proceeded to buſineſs, after chuſing a Moderator.</note>, who, however has no vote.</p>
                  <p>Upon the day appointed for the meeting of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly, the preceding Moderator makes a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before the King's Commiſſioner and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. After ſermon they go to the aſſembly houſe, where the Commiſſioner being upon the throne, they proceed to chuſe a Moderator. The election is thus managed: The laſt Moderator nominates two or three miniſters, to whom the aſſembly adds whom they ſee fit; the <hi>nominees</hi> are ſaid to be upon the liſt. Every man upon the liſt gives his vote and withdraws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the aſſembly votes, and he that has the majority is choſen, and takes the chair at the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of the throne.</p>
                  <p>The Moderator being choſen, the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner produces his commiſſion, impowering him to ſit there, with his Majeſty's letter to the aſſembly; both
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0010800104:99"/>which are read by the clerk, all the members ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Commiſſioner then makes a ſpeech, which is anſwered by the Moderator, and then committees are appointed. Next day is ſet apart for prayers, the Commiſſioner certainly attending. The Moderator no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates eight or nine to pray ſucceſſively; after which the aſſembly adjourns.</p>
                  <p>Next day they fall to buſineſs. The Moderator has no negative; he only ſums up the debates, and puts the queſtion. The firſt buſineſs is always to anſwer the King's letter, which is done by a committee, whoſe draught is read and examined, and altered if need be, and then finally approved by the houſe. Then the Moderator ſigns it in their preſence, and delivers it to the Commiſſioner, who diſpatches it to the King. Though the buſineſs is uſually tranſacted by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, yet any member may propoſe what he pleaſes in the aſſembly. When a motion is made, or any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is brought in by a committee, the Moderator names two or three of the moſt eminent members to ſpeak to it; after whom any member may ſpeak that is ſo inclined. When the debate is over, it is put to the vote, and carried, <hi>agreed,</hi> or <hi>diſagreed,</hi> by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority.</p>
                  <p>Matters of great weight, that bind the whole church, are firſt brought in by way of overtures, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the houſe; after which, if approved, they are tranſmitted to every preſbytery in Scotland, who return their anſwers by their commiſſioners to the next aſſembly, who, according as they find them approved by the preſbyteries, paſs them into acts of aſſembly, or reject them.</p>
                  <p>During every aſſembly, a diet is appointed to inſpect the acts of the provincial ſynods, as they had before inſpected the proceedings of the preſbyteries. Before they riſe, they nominate a ſtanding commiſſion of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and ruling elders, choſen out of every ſynod, to attend the affairs of the church, till the next aſſembly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0010800104:100"/>meets. Of theſe twenty-one is a <hi>quorum,</hi> of whom fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen muſt be miniſters. The Moderator of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly moderates in the commiſſion, if preſent. They were obliged to ſit the firſt week in every quarter, all parliament-time, before the union, and as often elſe as they thought fit. They have the power of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in all matters referred to them from it: regularly they can act in nothing but what is recommended from the aſſembly; but then that recommendation often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a general clauſe, impowering them to act in every thing that may be for the good of the church. They are accountable to the next general aſſembly, and therefore keep a regiſter of their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>When the aſſembly are to riſe, the Moderator tells them that it is time to diſſolve themſelves, and appoint another aſſembly in the name of their maſter, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: then he ſpeaks to the Commiſſioner, in the name of the aſſembly, who returns an anſwer, and then diſſolves them in the King's name, and fixes the time and place for the new aſſembly, which is always to be within a year and a day after the diſſolution of the old one. The Moderator then prays, and the aſſembly ſing a pſalm; after which the Moderator bleſſes them, and they ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>The deacon, whoſe office is for life, is choſen by the kirk-ſeſſion in every pariſh, approved by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and ſolemnly ſet apart by the miniſter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſermon and prayer for the occaſion. He collects the offerings for the poor, inquires into their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diſtributes to them as the kirk-ſeſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points; he aſſiſts at the communion, and attends the miniſters and elders in their viſitations and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He has no vote in the kirk-ſeſſions, but may give his opinion, if aſked; nor has he any ſtipend from the pariſh.</p>
                  <p>The ruling elders are choſen out of the pariſh by the kirk-ſeſſion, and ordained before the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after ſermon and prayer; their office is alſo for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0010800104:101"/>life, in caſe of no miſdemeanor. They aſſiſt the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in overſeeing and correcting the manners of the people, attend them in viſiting and catechiſing their diſtricts in the pariſhes, in praying with the ſick, in private admonitions, and at the communion-table. In all matters of government and diſcipline they have an equal vote with the miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Miniſters, or preaching preſbyters, only can preach and adminiſter the ſacraments, catechiſe, pronounce church-cenſures, ordain deacons and ruling elders, aſſiſt at the impoſition of hands upon other miniſters, and moderate, or preſide, in all eccleſiaſtical judicatories. Severe ſcrutinies are made into their qualifications, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting life and manners; they muſt be competently ſkilled in the ſcriptures, the learned languages, and all ſorts of divinity. They are always <hi>tried</hi> by the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, before they are licenſed to preach, in order to have <hi>calls</hi> to be miniſters of any pariſh. Indeed, in Scotland, all their miniſters have an univerſity-educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at leaſt have commenced Maſter of Arts. They are not ordained till they have obtained a <hi>call</hi> to a particular flock, and when that is obtained, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſert it, without the authority of a preſbytery, or ſome ſuperior judicatory. To be guilty of non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence merits deprivation. If the call is agreed to by the congregation, the miniſter preſent atteſts it by his ſubſcription, in their preſence, and then reports it to the preſbytery, who acquaint the perſon concerned, as ſoon as poſſible. If on trial he ſatisfies the preſbytery, they then iſſue out an edict, that all who can object any thing againſt this <hi>nominee,</hi> ſhould appear before the preſbytery, there to make good their allegations. If the objections are of weight, or even doubtful, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is ſuſpended, till a more perfect trial, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they proceed to ordination. On the ordination-day, a faſt is ſtrictly kept to implore God's bleſſing upon the work they are about; the Moderator preaches upon the nature and dignity of the miniſterial office, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0010800104:102"/>to be ordained is examined of his faith and aſſent to the doctrine and diſcipline of the kirk, the motive of his coming into the miniſtry, and whether by any indirect means he has obtained his preſentation or call, of his reſolution to do his duty faithfully, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. If he anſwers to the Moderator's ſatisfaction, the pariſhioners ratify their choice by lifting up their hands. The Moderator and miniſters preſent, then lay their hands upon his head, and ſo ordain him miniſter of the goſpel, and paſtor of that congregation. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being over, the elders, heritors, and chief pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners, take their miniſter by the hand. If the <hi>nominee</hi> had been ordained before, he is only recommended to the people, with a ſuitable ſermon and prayers, by the Moderator, and the people take him by the hand. The patron, for at preſent every pariſh has a patron, is bound to nominate, or preſent, in ſix months after a vacancy, otherwiſe the preſbytery fills the place, <hi>jure devoluto;</hi> but that privilege does not hold in royal burghs. Patronages were reſtored by 10 Anne.</p>
                  <p>The ſtipends of miniſters ſhould, at the very loweſt, be 50 l. ſterling <hi>per annum.</hi> Some are 150l. <hi>per ann.</hi> out of which they pay a proportionable tax for the ſupport of the widows and orphans of miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Such as are found guilty of aſſaulting the lives of miniſters, or robbing their houſes, or actually attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, ſhall be puniſhed by death, and eſcheat of moveables. Five hundred merks is allowed to the diſcoverer, and three hundred merks to the apprehender of the criminals, to be paid out of the King's treaſury. For their better accommodation, they are provided with convenient parſonage houſes (manſes), and where they are not fitting, the heritors of the pariſh ſhall build complete ones for them, not exceeding 1000 l. nor under 500 merks value.</p>
                  <p>The kirk-ſeſſion can judge in matters of leſſer ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; they can ſuſpend from the Lord's ſupper for a time: their conſent in the call of a miniſter and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0010800104:103"/>(pariſh-clerk) is neceſſary. They provide all neceſſaries for the communion, regulate all particulars relative to public worſhip, and give notice of all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſings and parochial viſitations. They have a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, who is choſen out of the deacons, to keep and diſtribute the poor's money: they keep two regiſters, one of births and marriages, the other of their own proceedings, which they muſt lay before the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Appeals lie from them, in all caſes, to their own preſbytery, whom they muſt not contradict.</p>
                  <p>Preſbyteries have no juriſdiction beyond their own bounds. They determine all appeals from kirk-ſeſſions; but can try nothing at the firſt inſtance, which is cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable before a kirk-ſeſſion. They compoſe all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between miniſters and people, for which they hold preſbyterial viſitations in every pariſh, where they examine the regiſters of kirk-ſeſſions, and cenſure or commend as they find cauſe. They inquire into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of churches, and ſee that glebes and manſes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no dilapidation. They appoint ſchools, and ſee that the funds ſettled by act of parliament for that purpoſe be not miſemployed; and the ſchoolmaſters are ſubject to their cenſure and examination. They only can inflict the greater excommunication, i. e. ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute prohibition of the communion. They licence probationers, interpoſe in all calls and ordinations of miniſters, ſuſpend and depoſe them, and, in fine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine eccleſiaſtical matters of all kinds within their bounds; but ſo as not to contradict any act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There lies an appeal, in all caſes, from the preſbyteries to the provincial ſynods. Before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict private cenſures, they obſerve a faſt. In theſe private cenſures every miniſter withdraws by turns, and the Moderator inquires of the reſt concerning his conduct, and, according to the report, they are called in, and commended or cenſured. All eccleſiaſtical ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, it may be here obſerved, begin, adjourn, and diſſolve themſelves by prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0010800104:104"/>Preſbyteries are ſubject to the privy cenſures of the ſynods, as miniſters are to thoſe of the preſbyteries. At every ordinary ſeſſion of the provincial ſynods, a diet is appointed, i. e. one certain time, in which theſe privy cenſures are performed.</p>
                  <p>Before every communion, the miniſter viſits and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines every family in his pariſh, once at leaſt; of which viſits notice is given the preceding Lord's day, that every diſtrict may know when he intends to viſit them. To live ſix weeks in a pariſh makes a man a pariſhioner; after which, if he leaves it, he muſt get a certificate of his good behaviour, ſigned by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or kirk-ſeſſion clerk, in the name, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of the kirk-ſeſſion. If the new comer only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from another family in the pariſh, his name is transferred in the regiſter (or examination-book) to its proper place. The miniſter, on his viſit, marks and enters the children in his examination-book, if they are of a fit age. He then exhorts every one to a ſtrict obſervance of their reſpective duties, and particularly to family-prayer, reading the ſcriptures, and ſinging of pſalms. To omit family-prayer is eſteemed very ſcandalous; and the omiſſion is often puniſhed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. At parting, the miniſter uſually prays with every family. Viſitation being over, the miniſter gives notice when he will examine the perſons marked in his book. Every diſtrict comes to church by themſelves, at the time appointed; and the miniſter, accompanied by the elder and deacon of that diſtrict, examines them, in order as they ſtand in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-book. He examines them out of the <hi>ſhorter Catechiſm;</hi> and if the perſon anſwers, he catechiſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe queſtions, and inſtructs them in what is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. He marks at every one's name how they anſwer. Grown perſons, who have been often exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, are not catechiſed, when they are found to be ſufficiently knowing; this exerciſe being chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for children and ignorant perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0010800104:105"/>Every Lord's day there is public worſhip twice in every pariſh-church in Scotland
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide the Weſtminſter Directory to the public worſhip of God.</note>. Firſt a pſalm is ſung, which is read, and then tuned by the miniſter, or pariſh-clerk; after which the miniſter prays, and then reads a chapter or two out of the Bible, which he expounds for about half an hour; this they call lecturing: then another pſalm is ſung, then another prayer offered up; after which ſermon begins, and that ended, there is another prayer, and another pſalm, and then all is concluded with the miniſter's bleſſing. In the afternoon there is no lecturing.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm, in the church of Scotland, is adminiſtered by none but the miniſter, who does it by ſprinkling; and whether it is performed at church or at home, there is always a ſermon before it. The father, or, in his abſence, ſome reputable neighbour, preſents the infant to the miniſter, who aſks the parent, if he deſires the child ſhall be received into the viſible church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſigns and ſeals of the covenant of grace, by baptiſm? Upon his anſwering <hi>yea,</hi> the miniſter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on the nature of baptiſm, &amp;c. &amp;c. and then ſprinkles a little water in the child's face, <hi>in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some time before the Lord's ſupper is adminiſtered, the congregation is to have notice thereof from the pulpit. The week before, the kirk-ſeſſion meets, and draws up a liſt of all the communicants in the pariſh, according to the miniſter's examination-book, and the reſtimony of the elders and deacons. According to this liſt, tickets are delivered to each communicant, if deſired, and the miniſters and elders alſo give tickets to ſtrangers who bring ſufficient teſtimonials. None are allowed to communicate without ſuch tickets, which are produced at the table. Thoſe who never received are inſtructed by the miniſter, ſeverally, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the nature of the ſacraments, and taught
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0010800104:106"/>what is the proper preparation thereunto. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is always celebrated upon the Lord's day. The Wedneſday or Thurſday before there is a ſolemn faſt, and on the Saturday there are two preparatory ſermons. On Sunday morning, after ſinging and prayer as uſual, the miniſter of the pariſh preaches a ſuitable ſermon; and, when the ordinary worſhip is ended, he, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, forbids the unworthy to approach, and invites the penitent to come and receive the ſacrament. Then he goes into the body of the church, where one or two tables, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its width, are placed, reaching from one end to the other, covered with a white linen cloth, and ſeats on both ſides, for the communicants. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter places himſelf at the end or middle of the table, on which the elements are placed. After a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he reads the inſtitution, and bleſſes the elements; then he breaks the bread, and diſtributes it and the wine to thoſe that are next him, who tranſmit them to their neighbours; the elders and deacons attending to ſerve, and to ſee that the whole is performed with decency and order. Whilſt theſe communicate, the miniſter diſcourſes concerning the nature of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the firſt company has received, they withdraw, and others take their places; and whilſt this is performing, a pſalm is ſung, and ſo they continue till all have communicated. The miniſter then returns to the pulpit, and diſcourſes concerning the particular caſes of communicants; and, with thankſgiving and ſinging of pſalms, the morning ſervice is concluded. Then the congregation is diſmiſſed for an hour, and ſo meet again, when they have the uſual afternoon worſhip; and on Monday, about nine o'clock in the morning, there is public worſhip and two ſermons, which cloſe the whole.</p>
                  <p>On theſe occaſions, the pariſh-miniſter is aſſiſted by two or three of his neighbours, and ſeldom preaches
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0010800104:107"/>oftener than the morning of the ſacrament-day. No private communions are allowed in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>No holy-days are obſerved in Scotland, beſides the Lord's-day, which is obſerved with great exactneſs. They likewiſe obſerve faſts and thankſgivings; in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing which, tho' they attribute a power to the church, yet they have the ſanction of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as thereby they may be more ſtrictly kept.</p>
                  <p>Marriage is ſolemnized by the miniſter, and none can marry that are nearer than couſin germans; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited degrees in blood hold alſo in affinity. Banns are aſked, on three ſeveral Lord's days, in churches where both parties live, before marriage can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. The miniſter firſt prays, then diſcourſes upon the inſtitution, riſe, and ends of matrimony, and the duties the parties owe to each other. The reſt of the ceremony, ſave the uſe of the ring, as well as the form of words uſed, are nearly the ſame as thoſe in the church of England. The whole is concluded with a prayer.</p>
                  <p>The diſcipline of the church of Scotland is regulated by two acts of aſſembly, one dated April 4, 1705, the other April 18, 1717, which declare that nothing ſhall be accounted ſcandalous, but what is accounted ſo by the word of God, or by ſome act or univerſal cuſtom of the church of Scotland agreeable thereto. If a ſcandal be not notified in five years, it ſhall not be revived ſo as to form a proceſs thereanent, unleſs it becomes again flagrant; but in ſuch caſes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the offenders ought to be dealt with in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to bring them to a ſenſe of their ſin and duty. All church-judicatories have power to convene, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and cenſure every perſon within their own bounds, in all eccleſiaſtical cauſes cognizable before every ſuch judicatory. Perſons living without the bounds of any judicatory, ſhall not, for order ſake, be cited by them; but they ſhall deſire the judicatory, under whom ſuch perſons live, to cauſe him to appear before the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, before whom the cauſe is to be examined.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0010800104:108"/>Miniſters are not ſubject to their own kirk-ſeſſions, but to the ſuperior judicatories of the church. In ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, private admonition is to be firſt uſed. Where perſons or parties are concerned, the court muſt give them, firſt, a legal and timely citation, ſetting forth the cauſes thereof: if the perſon reſides in the pariſh, forty-eight hours notice is ſufficient, and the officer muſt certify his having properly executed the ſummons, by calling the party at his door. No man is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared contumacious till he has been three times cited, either perſonally or at his dwelling houſe, if the cauſe be tried at the firſt inſtance; but if it be in the caſe of a reference or appeal, where the perſon had actually appeared already before an inferior court, a citation <hi>apud acta,</hi> to appear before his ſuperior, is ſufficient if it be minuted; and if inſtructed, infers contumacy if not obeyed. Though in theſe caſes a man may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, forthwith, contumacious, upon his non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and not producing any <hi>relevant</hi> (ſufficient) excuſe; yet the court is adviſed to examine and try the cauſe, either by witneſſes upon oath, or otherwiſe, before they pronounce the perſon cited contumacious. If the party appears, the Moderator is to acquaint him with the cauſe, and to give him, if deſired, a note of the cauſe, and the witneſſes that are to be made uſe of. Where there is no formal complaint, there is no need of accuſers or informers, but the party cited is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily to anſwer the queſtions put to him by the court: but then, if he be acquitted, the court, whether he requires it or not, ſhould cenſure the informers for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny or impudence. The defender ſhould have a liſt of the names of the witneſſes, ſome time before, or at his appearance. Theſe ought alſo to have timely notice, that they may appear and give their evidence. If they do not appear after the third ſummons, they may be proceeded againſt as contumacious, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication may be made to the civil magiſtrate to oblige them to appear. What the party can object in his own
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0010800104:109"/>vindication, is to be diſcuſſed, before the witneſſes can be judicially examined: if the court thinks his objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions juſt, the witneſſes are to be caſt. An informer may be a witneſs, where he does not formally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for his own intereſt, or where there are no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of malice in the accuſation. Witneſſes, even where there is no <hi>relevant</hi> objection, muſt purge themſelves of malice, bribes, good deed done, or to be done, and partial counſel. Witneſſes are to be ſworn and examined before the Moderator and the perſon accuſed; and, if he appears, the accuſed may deſire to have the witneſſes croſs-examined, when they have given in all their evidence. Before the proof is made, the accuſed may offer grounds of exculpation, <hi>i. e.</hi> bring witneſſes to prove his innocence, which if he inſiſts upon, it muſt be allowed. If the exculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be fully proved, <hi>e. g.</hi> if he can prove an <hi>alibi,</hi> he muſt be acquitted. But there is no room for exculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after depoſitions are once taken. Witneſſes muſt ſubſcribe all their depoſitions if they can write; or, if they cannot, the Moderator muſt ſubſcribe it for them. Depoſitions being taken, the parties withdraw, and the matter is calmly debated by the preſbytery. Fugitives, whilſt proceſs is depending, muſt firſt be cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the pulpits of their reſpective pariſhes; then from the pulpit of every pariſh in the preſbytery. If they do not at laſt appear, they are to be declared fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from church-diſcipline, and that declaration muſt be intimated in all the bounds of the preſbytery; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is to be ſtopped, till notice can begot of thoſe perſons. In caſe of drunkenneſs, diſobedience to parents, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, ſwearing, curſing, ſcolding, fighting, lying, cheating, or ſtealing, the perſons guilty are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily admoniſhed in private only for the firſt offence; for the ſecond offence, rebuked by the ſeſſion, and, on promiſe of amendment, there they are to ſtop. If no amendment follows, the kirk-ſeſſion ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſentence of leſſer excommunication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0010800104:110"/>which the perſon is to lie, till amendment appears. If the guilty perſon neglects to take the ſentence off, and relapſes into the vices for which he is cenſured, it may be conſtrued into ſuch a degree of contumacy, as may merit the greater excommunication, which may be inflicted or not, as ſhall be judged convenient. Other crimes that come before the eccleſiaſtical judicatories, are caſes of uncleanneſs, where there is no child—of a married woman's being with child whoſe huſband has been abſent longer than the uſual time of her going with child—of an unmarried woman being with child, who ſhould be pronounced contumacious if ſhe will not diſcover the father—of the delated father of the child —of inceſt—adultery—relapſe in fornication—murder —atheiſm—idolatry—witchcraft—maiming—he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy—error publickly vented—ſchiſm, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe acts above-mentioned ſettle the manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the preſbytery, &amp;c. the manner of treating complaints againſt miniſters, &amp;c. &amp;c. which ſome of my readers would think tedious, and for which the more curious had better conſult the acts themſelves

                  <p>In ordinary caſes the leſſer excommunication only is inſlicted, which is done after much deliberation and tenderneſs to the criminal, and with great ſolemnity; the people are exhorted not to hold unneceſſary-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. The greater excommunication the church only inflicts upon the moſt obſtinate offenders. It is the expulſion of the offender from the communion of the faithful, a debarring him from all the privileges of church-memberſhip, and, in the words of the apoſtle, <hi>a delivery of him over to Satan.</hi> However, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication diſſolves no civil or natural rights, nor does it exempt from the duties belonging to them.</p>

                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0010800104:111"/>If when all this is done, it be found ineffectual for the purpoſes intended, the civil magiſtrate ſhould be deſired to uſe his coercive power to ſuppreſs all ſuch offences, and to vindicate the diſcipline of the church from contempt.</p>
                  <p>The end of church-cenſure being the repentance of the ſinner, if he ſhews real ſigns of godly ſorrow, and if, upon application to the preſbytery firſt made, they give a warrant for his abſolution, he is to be brought before the congregation, and there confeſs his ſin, and expreſs his ſorrow for it. This is to be repeated as often as the preſbytery and kirk-ſeſſion ſhall judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. When the congregation is thus ſatisfied of his repentance, the miniſter is, in a prayer with the congregation, to deſire our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has inſtituted the ordinance of excommunication, <hi>i. e.</hi> of binding and looſing the ſins of men upon earth, with a promiſe of ratifying above, the rightful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that ſhall be paſſed here below, to accept of this man's repentance, to forgive his former diſobedience, and to aſſiſt him with his ſpirit, that he may never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain relapſe into the like offences. And then, prayer being ended, he pronounces the ſentence of abſolution, by which he wholly takes off the former ſentence, and receives him into the communion of the church, and the free uſe of all the ordinances of Chriſt. Sentence being paſſed, the miniſter exhorts him, as a brother, to perſeverance in his godly reſolution; the elders embrace him, and the congregation, thence forward, communicate with him as a member of their own body; and wherever the ſentence of excommunication hath been publiſhed, the ſentence of abſolution is alſo expreſsly intimated.</p>

                  <p>At burials of the dead the church of Scotland uſes neither funeral ſermons or any public prayers; they are performed without any ceremony of words, only the bodies are decently attended to the graves, by all that pleaſe to go; of which they have notice (at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bugh particularly) by ringing of a hand-bell thro' the ſtreet, by the cryer, who ſays, "All brethren and ſiſters, I let you to wot that there is a brother— or ſiſter—departed at the pleaſure of Almighty God, &amp;c." and then gives notice when he or ſhe is to be interred.

                  <p>For the advancement of religion in Scotland, the ſociety for propagating Chriſtian knowledge, was erected by letters-patent from Queen Anne, "granting them full power to receive ſubſcriptions, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, donations, legacies, ſums of money, lands, goods and gear, and therewith to erect and maintain ſchools to teach to read, eſpecially the holy ſcriptures, and other good and pious books; and alſo to teach writing and arithmetic, and ſuch like degrees of knowledge, in the highlands, iſlands, and remote corners of Scotland," appointing their meetings, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe letters<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patent bear date May 25, 1709, which year the general aſſembly paſſed an act to encourage the deſign of erecting charity-ſchools. Both theſe inſtitutions have met with deſerved ſucceſs: in every pariſh there is a charity-ſchool, whoſe maſter has a ſalary from the public, and the ſcholars allow them ſome ſmall matter quarterly. In country-ſchools they teach writing, arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0010800104:113"/>and reading Engliſh, and in ſome Latin. In the royal burghs they teach Latin and Greek, and have tolerable ſalaries; beſides that each ſcholar gives 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. a quarter; and in theſe ſchools they teach nothing elſe, having Engliſh and writing ſchools beſides, in all places where they have grammar ſchools. In country-pariſhes, the ſchoolmaſter is uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor and kirk-ſeſſion clerk, which brings him in ſome advantage; for he receives 1 s. and ſometimes 1 s. and 8 d. for aſking banns of marriage; 8 d. for regiſtering a child that is chriſtened; and 3d. for a certificate for any perſon that removes out of the pariſh. The ſchoolmaſters are obliged to take the oath of allegiance, to ſubſcribe the confeſſion of faith, and muſt ſubmit to a trial from the preſbytery of the bounds.</p>
                  <p>For a continual ſupply of miniſters in the church of Scotland, it was ordained by the general aſſembly, in 1645, that a number of pious youths, of good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and approved ability, ſhould be choſen and ſent <hi>burſars</hi> or <hi>exhibitioners,</hi> to the univerſities, by the ſeveral preſbyteries of Scotland. Theſe <hi>burſars</hi> are to be allowed for their maintenance 100 l.

The burſar not to continue at the univerſity above four years, and when any are removed by death, or called to a particular charge, others are to ſucceed in their room. All burſars of theology are obliged to bring ſufficient teſtimonies from the univerſities, where they are bred, of their proficiency and good behaviour, and be alſo ready to give proof of their labours, at the ſeveral ſynods, if it ſhall be required: and if they are found deficient, their exhibitions are taken away, and given to others.</p>

                  <p>In the year 1578, the city of Edinburgh founded their high ſchool, by warrant and encouragement from King James VI. whence it took the name of the King's ſchool; it has a maſter, four uſhers, a writing maſter, and a janitor; all which have fixed, competent ſalaries, except the writing maſter, whoſe benefit is caſual. It hath a public library erected by the town-council in 1658, principally conſiſting of the Latin and Greek claſſics.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0010800104:115"/>communion with God, are under his wrath and curſe, and ſo made liable to all the miſeries in this life, to death itſelf, and to the pains of hell for ever
<note n="*" place="bottom">Aſſembly's Catechiſm.</note>.—The doctrine of election; that God, out of his mere good pleaſure, from all eternity, elected ſome to everlaſting life, did enter into a covenant of grace, to deliver them out of ſin and miſery, and to bring them into an eſtate of ſalvation by a redeemer.—That the only redeemer of God's elect is Jeſus Chriſt, who being the eternal Son of God, became man, and ſo was, and continueth to be God and man, in two diſtinct natures and one perſon.—That <hi>effectual calling</hi> is the work of God's ſpirit.—That we are juſtified by God's free grace, only for the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, and received by faith alone.—That the ſouls of believers are at their death made perfect in holineſs, and do immediately paſs into glory, and their bodies ſtill being united to Chriſt, do reſt in their graves till the reſurrection.—That every ſin deſerveth God's wrath and curſe, both in this life and that which is to come; to eſcape which wrath and curſe, due to us for ſin, God requireth of us faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which faith is a ſaving grace, whereby we receive, and reſt upon him alone for ſalvation, as he is offered to us in the goſpel.—That repentance is a ſaving grace, whereby a ſinner, out of a true ſenſe of his ſin, and apprehenſion of the mercy of God in Chriſt, doth with grief and hatred of his ſin turn from it unto God, with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of, and endeavour after a new obedience.—That the outward and ordinary means, whereby Chriſt communicateth to us the benefits of redemption, are his ordinances, eſpecially the word, ſacraments and prayer, all which are made effectual to the elect, for ſalvation.—That the Spirit of God maketh the reading, but eſpecially the preaching of the word, an effectual means of convincing and converting ſinners, and of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0010800104:116"/>building them up in holineſs and comfort, through faith, unto ſalvation.—That the word muſt be attended unto with diligence, preparation and prayer; received with faith and love, laid up in our hearts, and practiſed in our lives, to make it effectual to ſalvation.—That the ſacraments become effectual means of ſalvation, not from any virtue in them, or in him that doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter them, but only by the bleſſing of Chriſt, and the working of the ſpirit in them that by faith receive them.—That the ſacrament is an holy ordinance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, wherein by ſenſible ſigns, Chriſt and the benefits of the new covenant are repreſented, ſealed, and applied to believers.—That the ſacraments of the New Teſtament are baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper.—That baptiſm is a ſacrament wherein the waſhing with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, doth ſignify and ſeal our ingrafting into Chriſt, and partaking of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the covenant of grace, and our engagement to be the Lord's.—That baptiſm is to be adminiſtered to ſuch only as profeſs their faith in Chriſt and obedience to him; but the infants of ſuch as are members of the viſible church are to be baptiſed.—That the Lord's ſupper is a ſacrament, wherein, by giving and receiving bread and wine, according to Chriſt's appointment, his death is ſhewed forth, and the worthy receivers are, not after a corporal and carnal manner, but by faith, made partakers of his body and blood, with all his benefits, to their ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in grace.—That it is required of them that would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily partake of the Lord's ſupper, that they examine themſelves of their knowledge to diſcern the Lord's body, of their faith to feed upon him, of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, love, and new obedience, leſt coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, they eat and drink judgment to themſelves.

               <p>THIS denomination of Proteſtant Diſſenters have been called by different names at different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time. In their firſt attempts for a further refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the church, they were, by way of reproach, termed Puritans, a name derived from the <hi>Cathari</hi> or <hi>Puritani</hi> of the third century after Chriſt. The ungenerous and cruel perſecutions they ſuffered for conſcience ſake, in the reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I. will ever reflect diſgrace upon the memory of thoſe Princes.</p>
               <p>I might ſay that Wickliffe, the firſt Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, maintained many of thoſe points, by which the Puritans were afterwards diſtinguiſhed, or trace them from the reign of Edward VI. when many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0010800104:118"/>divines were endeavouring a further reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ceremonies and fopperies of the church of Rome, particularly with regard to the Popiſh veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But I ſhall obſerve that the reformed exiles, who were driven to Franckfort, to avoid the cruelties of Mary I. (and who being outed from thence by thoſe reformers, who ſtickled for King Edward's liturgy in 1556, which the others ſcrupled the uſe of) and who afterwards ſet up congregations at Baſil and Geneva, and there followed the Geneva diſcipline, were firſt called <hi>Puritans,</hi> as their opponents obtained the name of <hi>Conformiſts.</hi> The hiſtory of the church of England, foregoing, has particularly recited their various ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for their oppoſition to the habits
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. iii. of this work, p. 382, &amp; ſeq.</note>, and their ſcruples in regard to the act of uniformity, with their ſeparation from the church thereon. But they had other objections againſt the hierarchy, beſides thoſe for which they were deprived, which they laboured inceſſantly throughout the reign of Elizabeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move;
<note n="†" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſtory of the Puritans, vol. i. p. 235.</note> they complained of the Biſhops affecting to be thought a ſuperior order to Preſbyters, and claiming the ſole right of ordination, and the uſe of the keys. They diſliked the temporal dignities and lordſhips an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their offices, and their engaging in ſecular employments, and truſts, &amp;c. as tending to exalt them too much above their brethren, and not ſo agreeable to their characters, as miniſters of Chriſt, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the due diſcharge of their ſpiritual func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—They excepted to the titles and offices of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, Deans, Chapters, and other officials belonging to cathedrals, as having no foundation in ſcripture, or primitive antiquity, but intrenching upon the privileges of the preſbyters of the ſeveral dioceſes. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the exorbitant power and juriſdiction of the Biſhops and their Chancellors in their ſpiritual courts, as derived from the canon law of the Pope, and not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0010800104:119"/>from the word of God, or the ſtatute law of the land: of their fining, impriſoning, depriving, and putting men to exceſſive charges for ſmall offences; and that the higheſt cenſures, ſuch as excommunication and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, were in the hands of laymen, and not in the ſpiritual officers of the church.—They lamented the want of a godly diſcipline, and were uneaſy at the promiſcuous and general acceſs of all perſons to the Lord's table. The church being deſcribed in her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as a <hi>congregation of faithful perſons,</hi> they thought it neceſſary that a power ſhould be lodged ſomewhere, to inquire into the qualifications of ſuch as deſired to be of her communion.—Though they did not diſpute the lawfulneſs of ſet forms of prayer, provided a due liberty was allowed for prayers of their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, before and after ſermon; yet they diſliked ſome things in the public liturgy, eſtabliſhed by law; as the frequent repetition of the Lord's prayer, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes, ſome paſſages in the offices of marriage, burial, &amp;c. ſuch as, <hi>with my body I thee worſhip; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> chanting of the pſalms, by turns, trumpets, organs, &amp;c. which were not in uſe in the church, for above 1200 years after Chriſt.—They ſcrupled confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to certain rites and ceremonies, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0010800104:120"/>by the rubrick, or the Queen's injunctions; viz. To the ſign of the croſs in baptiſm; baptiſm by mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives; the manner of churching women; the uſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and godmothers, to the excluſion of the parents from being ſureties for the education of their own child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, &amp;c. &amp;c. the cuſtom of confirming children, as ſoon as they could repeat the Lord's prayer and catechiſm, by which they had a right to come to the ſacrament without any other qualification; this might be done by children of five or ſix years old; kneeling at the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper; bowing to the name of Jeſus; the ring in marriage; to the wearing of the ſurplice and other veſtments to be uſed in divine ſervice. There was no difference in points of doctrine; ſo that one article more, and my readers have the chief heads of controverſy between the church of England and the Proteſtant Diſſenters at this time, viz. "The natural right that every man has to judge for himſelf, and make profeſſion of that religion he apprehends moſt agreeable to truth, as far as it does not affect the peace and ſafety of the government he lives under, without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the prejudices of education, the laws of the civil magiſtrate, or the decrees of councils, churches or ſynods."</p>
               <p>In the maintenance of their conſcientious ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſeemed inſpired with all the courage and fortitude of the primitive confeſſors and martyrs; in point of argument they had much the better of their adverſaries; but had no protection againſt the pains, penalties, impriſonments and fines impoſed by the governing powers; under which however they in general behaved with Chriſtian meekneſs and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled patience.</p>
               <p>The firſt Preſbyterian church in England was erected at Wandſworth, a village near London, and, on the 20th of November 1572, eleven elders were choſen, and their offices deſcribed, in a regiſter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>the order of Wandſworth.</hi> Other churches, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0010800104:121"/>proclamations for uniformity, &amp;c. were ſoon erected in other counties, though with the utmoſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy and ſecreſy. Under James the Firſt's perſecution, numbers of Puritan miniſters and others left the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and retired to Amſterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, Leyden, Utrecht, &amp;c. &amp;c. and erected churches in thoſe places after the Preſbyterian model; thoſe churches were maintained by the ſtates, according to treaty with Queen Elizabeth, as the French and Dutch churches were in England.</p>
               <p>The Puritans were far from finding any relaxation, of the ſeverities exerciſed againſt them, in the reign of the unfortunate Charles I. who following the violent advice of Archbiſhop Laud, reduced them to the neceſſity of quitting the kingdom in ſtill greater numbers, by his eſpouſing Arminianiſm, and oppoſing the old Calviniſtical doctrines. Arminianiſm and Popery may be ſaid to have been prevalent in his court; but were warmly oppoſed by the Calviniſts. Laud introduced Popiſh ornaments into the churches, turned the communion-tables into altars, puniſhing thoſe that oppoſed him with the utmoſt ſeverity, and with a total diſregard to the laws of the land. The oppoſers to theſe and other innovations were ſtiled <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal Puritans,</hi> and the patroniſers <hi>doctrinal Papiſts.</hi> Indeed it ſeemed to be Laud's favourite ſcheme to bring about a union of the churches of England and Rome, to which he ſacrificed the intereſts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of his maſter, and finally his own life. By his own arbitrary will he made many alterations in the book of Common Prayer, by which he rendered it ſtill more exceptionable to the Puritans; numbers of worthy clergymen were deprived, and ſuffered the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigours for not reading and inforcing the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the allowance of revels, may-games, &amp;c. &amp;c. on the Sabbath-day; and, in ſhort, the Puritan divines and others, on theſe accounts, underwent as cruel a perſecution as could be carried on by an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0010800104:122"/>If ſome of theſe conſcientious people were too ſtrict and preciſe in their oppoſition, they could not be much blamed, as there ſeemed ſuch a viſible deſign to defeat the bleſſed effects of the reformation, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing and adopting all the ceremonies and fopperies of the Romiſh church. Theſe perſecutions occaſioned the ſettlement of the colonies of New England, where many learned and pious miniſters, eminent merchants, and ſome thouſands of families, tranſported themſelves to avoid the rage of their enemies. <hi>Heylin</hi> obſerves, "the ſevere preſſing of the ceremonies made the people in many trading towns tremble at a viſitation; but when they found their ſtriving in vain, and that they had loſt the comfort of their lecturers
<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe lecturers were chiefly Puritans, who not being ſatisfied with a full conformity, ſo as to take upon them a cure of ſouls, only preached in the afternoon, being choſen and maintained by the people. They were ſtrict Calviniſts, warm and affectionate preachers, and diſtinguiſhed themſelves by a religious obſervation of the Lord's day, by a bold oppoſition to Popery and the new ceremonies, and by an uncommon ſeverity of life. The King by Laud's procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid them under ſuch difficulties that they were ſoon ſilenced, ſuch as, that the afternoon-ſervice be turned into catechiſing; that every lecturer read divine ſervice, before lecture, in his ſurplice and hood; that they preach in gowns, and not in cloaks; that no lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer be admitted that is not ready and willing to take upon him a living, with a cure of ſouls, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And ſuch as preached againſt Arminianiſm or the ceremonies were ſuſpended.</note>, who were turned out for not reading the ſecond ſervice at the communion-table in their hoods and ſurplices, and for uſing other prayers beſides that of the fifty-fifth canon, it was no hard matter for thoſe miniſters to perſuade them to tranſport themſelves into foreign parts. <hi>The ſun</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>ſhines as comfortably in other places, and the ſun of righteouſneſs much brighter; 'tis better to go and dwell in</hi> Goſhen, <hi>find it where we can, than tarry in the midſt of ſuch</hi> Egyptian <hi>bondage as is among us; the ſinful corruptions of the church are now grown ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that there is no place free from the contagion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go out of her, my people, and be not partaker of her ſins.</hi>

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0010800104:125"/>The body of the Puritans were, however, not now Preſbyterians; in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. they were for the moſt part of that opinion, though even then there were many Epiſcopalians among them; but from the time that Arminianiſm prevailed in the church, and the whole body of Calviniſts were to be diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Doctrinal Puritans,</hi> both parties ſeemed to unite in a moderate Epiſcopacy; for there was little or no mention of the old book of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, for twenty years before the beginning of the civil war, all the controverſy being upon points of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm; upon a reduction of the exorbitant power of the Biſhops, and upon innovations (as they were called) and ceremonies; there were few, either among the clergy or laity, that had a zeal for Preſbytery, or deſired any more than to be rid of their oppreſſions.</p>
               <p>Many of the ceremonies and innovations complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the Puritans were removed, by the long par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in 1641, and lectures again eſtabliſhed. They voted away the hierarchy of the church of England; but ſtill, at the beginning of the civil war, no other diſcipline was erected in its room; nor, as Mr. Neale obſerves, was the name, ſtile, and dignity of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops taken away by ordinance of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, till September 5, 1646, <hi>i. e.</hi> till the war was over, and the King their priſoner. In this interval there was properly no eſtabliſhed form of church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the clergy being permitted to read more or leſs of the liturgy as they pleaſed, and to govern their pariſhes according to their diſcretion. The veſtments were left indifferent, ſome wearing them, and others, in imitation of the foreign Proteſtants, making uſe of a cloak. In the place of that profaneneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of religion viſible before the civil war, all orders of men in the city, army, and country, became devout and pious. "The generality of thoſe people

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0010800104:126"/>out England, who went by the name of <hi>Puritans, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians, Preſbyterians,</hi> who followed ſermons, prayed in their families, read books of devotion, and were ſtrict obſervers of the Sabbath, being avowed enemies to ſwearing, drunkenneſs, and all kinds of profaneneſs, adhered to the parliament."—"Of the clergy, thoſe who were of the ſentiments of Calvin, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant preachers of the word of God themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers of it in others, who were zealous againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and wiſhed for a reformation of the diſcipline of the church, were on the parliament's ſide. Among thoſe were ſome of the elder clergy, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the riſe of Archbiſhop Laud; all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived and ſilenced miniſters, with the whole body of lecturers and warm popular preachers, both in town and country; theſe drew after them great numbers of the more ſerious and devout people, who were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of judging between the King and parliament, but followed their ſpiritual guides, from a veneration they had for their integrity and piety." No wonder with ſuch inſtruments the parliament did ſuch great things; for even the ſober men who were againſt the parliament, uſed to ſay, "The King had the better cauſe, but the parliament had the better men."</p>
               <p>On June 12, 1643, both houſes of parliament joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed an ordinance for the calling an aſſembly of divines, for ſettling the government and liturgy of the church of England, to meet July 1, in Henry VII.'s chapel in Weſtminſter abbey, hence called the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter aſſembly. This famous aſſembly drew up the well known confeſſion of faith, a larger and ſhorter catechiſm, and a form of church-government after the Preſbyterian mode, being principally urged thereto by the low ſtate of the parliament, and the indiſpenſible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there was for the aſſiſtance of the Scots, whoſe commiſſioners were ſent to join with them (as obſerved p. 60, before going) they admitted of the ſolemn
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0010800104:127"/>league and covenant. Our commiſſioners, as Burnet obſerves, preſſed for a civil league, but the Scots would have a religious one; to which the Engliſh were obliged to yield, but took care, at the ſame time, to leave a door open for the latitude of interpretation. "The Engliſh in foreign parts were not exempted from this teſt. December 20, 1643, it was ordered by the Lords and Commons, that no perſon ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being elected a common council-man of the city of London, or ſo much as have a voice in ſuch elections, who has not taken the covenant. January 29, 1644, it was ordered by the Commons, that the ſolemn league and covenant be, upon every day of faſting and public humiliation, publickly read in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry church and congregation within the kingdom; and every congregation is obliged to have <hi>one,</hi> fairly print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a large letter, in a table fitted to be hung up in a public place of the church or congregation, to be read by the people. All young miniſters were required to take the covenant at their ordination; none of the laity were continued in any office of truſt, civil or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, who refuſed it. Thus the very perſons who had oppoſed teſts and ſubſcriptions under Epiſcopacy, now were forward to impoſe them, in the ſevereſt manner, upon their fellow ſubjects and fellow Chriſtians. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the aſſembly, though compoſed in general of men of learning and excellent divines, yet had a perſecuting zeal, and hurt themſelves by running into heats upon the <hi>divine right</hi> of Preſbyterian government, which loſt them, together with their enmity to toleration, the hearts and ſupport of the parliament and their beſt friends. The Epiſcopal party had no concern in the government of the church from the time of the taking the covenant to the reſtoration, though the hierarchy was not yet ſet aſide by an ordinance of parliament. There were no more eccleſiaſtical courts, no wearing the habits, no regard paid to the canons or ceremonies,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0010800104:128"/>nor even to the common prayer itſelf. Whilſt the aſſembly of divines ſat, all church-buſineſs went thro' their hands; the pariſhes choſe their miniſters, the aſſembly examined and approved, and the parliament confirmed them in their benefices, without any regard to the Archbiſhop or his Vicar. In the diſtant counties the miniſters were put in by the parliament Generals, as appears by an ordinance of February 27, 1643, giving authority to Lord Fairfax to ſupply the churches in the North, the preamble to which recites, that "the houſes being credibly informed that many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in the county of York, were not only of a ſcandalous life, but having left their churches and cures, had withdrawn themſelves wilfully from the ſame, and joined ſuch forces as had been raiſed againſt the parliament, and aſſiſted them with men, money, horſes and arms; therefore it is ordained, that Lord Fairfax be authoriſed to fill up their places with ſuch learned and godly divines as he ſhall think fit, with advice of the aſſembly." In 1644 the univerſities were purged, and many of the officers deprived, with above 200 graduates and ſcholars, whoſe places were ſupplied by the aſſembly of divines, principally with Calviniſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the livings from which the hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical clergy were ejected, were alſo ſupplied by Preſbyterian divines; ſo that preſbytery was now the reigning religion; and it muſt be confeſſed, the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians were as determined againſt toleration as ever the church of England had lately been. But it muſt be ſaid they brought religion to be the reigning faſhion, the Lord's day was ſtrictly obſerved, all profaneneſs and immorality were diſcouraged, and the care and pains of the new governors of the church was abundantly viſible in the lives and behaviour of all ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple throughout the kingdom.</p>
               <p>After many and long debates in the Weſtminſter aſſembly and the parliament, on the divine right of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0010800104:129"/>preſbytery, the power of the keys, &amp;c. the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian form of church-government became the national eſtabliſhment, in 1645, by way of <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as far as an ordinance of parliament could make it; for the preamble ſets forth, "That if upon trial it was not found acceptable, it ſhould be reverſed or amended: that the two houſes found it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to make the new ſettlement agree with the laws and government of the kingdom: that therefore it could not be expected that a preſent rule, in every particular, ſhould be ſettled at once; but that there will be need of ſupplements and additions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alterations, as experience ſhall bring to light the neceſſity thereof."—"The parliament apprehended
<note n="*" place="bottom">Neale's Puritans, vol. iii. p. 295.</note> they had now eſtabliſhed the fundamentals of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian diſcipline, tho' it proved not to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one party of Chriſtians; ſo hard it is to make a good ſettlement when men dig up old founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions all at once. The Preſbyterian government was as narrow as the prelatical; and as it did not allow a liberty of conſcience, but claimed a civil, as well as eccleſiaſtical authority, over men's perſons and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was equally, if not more, inſufferable."—"The ſettling preſbytery
<note n="†" place="bottom">Biſhop Kennet.</note> was ſupported by the fear and love of the Scots army; and when theſe were gone home, it was better managed by the Engliſh army, who were for Independency, and a better principle of toleration; but as things ſtood, no-body was pleaſed; the Epiſcopalians and Independants were excluded; and becauſe the parliament would not give the ſeveral preſbyteries an abſolute power over their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, but reſerved the laſt appeal to themſelves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scots nor Engliſh Preſbyterians would accept of the ordinance."</p>
               <p>The aſſembly petitioned the houſes of parliament, aſſerting the divine right of the Preſbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0010800104:130"/>and complaining of a clauſe in the late ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which eſtabliſhed an appeal from the cenſures of the church to a committee of parliament. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they voted the aſſembly guilty of a <hi>praemunire;</hi> and whereas they inſiſted ſo peremptorily on the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of the Preſbyterian government, the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of parliament drew up certain queries, which they ſent to the aſſembly by three of their members, and deſired they would reſolve to their ſatisfaction. The three members alſo ſet before them their raſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent conduct, and ſhewed wherein they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their province, which was "to adviſe the houſes in ſuch points as they ſhould lay before them, but not to dictate to thoſe to whom they owed their being an aſſembly." The aſſembly, terrified at what they heard, appointed a ſolemn faſt; and the next year, 1646, the Independants having left them, and the Eraſtians dividing them in the committee appointed to conſider the queſtions, and entering their diſſent, when the anſwer was laid before them, it was not called the anſwer of the committee, but of ſome brethren of the committee; and when the queſtion was put, the Eraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans withdrew from the aſſembly, and left the high Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians to themſelves, who agreed with but one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting voice, that "Jeſus Chriſt, as King of the church, hath himſelf appointed a church-government diſtinct from the civil magiſtrate." After more ſquab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings with the parliament, the Preſbyterian miniſters complied to put the Preſbyterial government in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, according to the preſent eſtabliſhment, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of certain <hi>conſiderations and cautions,</hi> which they drew up.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the kingdom, inſtead of ſo many dioceſes, was divided into a certain number of provinces, made up of repreſentatives from the ſeveral claſſes within their boundaries. Every pariſh had a congregational or parochial preſbytery for the affairs of the pariſh;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0010800104:131"/>the parochial preſbyteries were combined into claſſes: theſe choſe repreſentatives for the provincial aſſemblies, as the provincial did for the national. "Thus the Preſbyterian church-government began to riſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its proper form; but new obſtructions being raiſed by the miniſters to the choice of repreſentatives, the provincial aſſembly of London did not meet till the year 1647, nor did it ever obtain but in London and Lancaſhire. The parliament never came heartily into it; however, the Preſbyterian miniſters had their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary aſſociations for church-affairs in moſt counties, tho' without any authoritative juriſdiction."</p>
               <p>It ſhould have been obſerved, that the Preſbyterians had refuſed to come to a toleration of their brethren the Independants, in 1645, after much altercation and many papers had paſſed relative thereto, in a <hi>committee of accommodation,</hi> as it was ſtiled, conſiſting of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Lords and Commons appointed to treat with the Scots commiſſioners and the committee of divines, to endeavour a union, if poſſible, or to find out "how far tender conſciences, who cannot in all things ſubmit to the ſame rule, may be borne with, according to the word of God, and conſiſtent with the public peace. "Little did the Preſbyterian divines think, ſays Neale, that in leſs than twenty years all their artillery would be turned againſt themſelves; that they ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the eſtabliſhment by an act of prelatical unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; that they ſhould be reduced to the neceſſity of pleading for that indulgence, which they now denied their brethren; and think it their duty to gather churches for ſeparate worſhip, out of others which they allowed to be true ones. If the leading Preſbyterians in the aſſembly and city had come to a temper with the Independants, on the foot of a limited toleration, they had, in all likelihood, prevented the diſputes between the army and parliament, which were the ruin of both; they might then have ſaved the conſtitution, and made
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0010800104:132"/>their own terms with the King, who was now their priſoner; but they were enchanted with the beauties of covenant uniformity, and the <hi>divine right</hi> of their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, which after all the parliament would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in its full extent."</p>
               <p>From the year 1647 to the death of Charles I. matters with regard to the Preſbyterians continued much upon the ſame footing; yet tho' they filled moſt of the livings, and had the city and great part of the parliament at their devotion, they met with many mortifications from the Independants and army, who were moſtly of that ſect; but principally for their rigid and intolerant ſpirit, which diſguſted all the other ſects: they had done all they could while the army was marched againſt the Scots, in 1648, to bring about a peace with the King; but the unhappy Prince obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed to comply with their terms, nor would the Preſbyterians relax in them, ſo that the army had an opportunity given them to break all their meaſures.</p>
               <p>It is my opinion, after carefully conſulting every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> that the Preſbyterians are cleared from any ſhare in the guilt of putting the King to death; nay, the London miniſters publiſhed <hi>a ſerious and faithful repreſentation,</hi> againſt doing any violence to the perſon of the King, addreſſed to the general and his council of officers, Jan. 18, 1648. To wipe away the calumnies thrown out againſt them on that account, they publiſhed a paper alſo, intitled, <hi>a vindication of the London miniſters from the unjuſt aſperſions caſt upon their former actings for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as if they had promoted the bringing the King to capital puniſhment.</hi> In this vindication, after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring over again their diſlike of the proceedings againſt the King, they conclude in words to this effect: "Therefore, according to our covenant, we do, in the name of the great God, warn and exhort all that belong to our reſpective charges, or to whom we have adminiſtered the ſaid covenant, to abide by their vow, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be perſuaded

<note n="*" place="bottom">The deſign of this paper was to change the government into a kind of a commonwealth, without a King and houſe of Lords. It was tendered to the nation by the officers of the army. It provided amongſt other matters for a toleration.</note> 
                  <hi>agreement of the people,</hi> which is ſubverſive of the preſent conſtitution, and makes way for the toleration of all hereſies and blaſphemies, and will effectually divide the two kingdoms of England and Scotland. We earneſtly beſeech them to mourn for the ſins of the parliament and city, and for the miſcarriages of the King himſelf, in his government, which have caſt him down from his excellency, into an horrid pit of miſery almoſt beyond example; and to pray, that God would give him effectual repentance, and to ſanctify the bitter cup of divine diſpleaſure, which divine providence has put into his hands; and that God would reſtrain the violence of men, that they may not dare to draw upon themſelves and the kingdom <hi>the blood of their ſovereign.</hi>" In ſhort, they ſhewed themſelves, in the ſecond civil war, almoſt unanimous for accommodating matters with the King; but, as before obſerved, the ſtiffneſs of both parties rendered their deſigns abortive, and brought on a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe to which they were utterly averſe, and uſed every means in their power to prevent.</p>
               <p>That the reader may ſee the principles of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians of thoſe days, I ſhall firſt make an extract from <hi>a teſtimony of the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, and to our ſolemn league and covenant; as alſo againſt the errors, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and blaſphemies of theſe times, and the toleration of them; to which is added a catalogue of the ſaid errors,</hi> &amp;c. publiſhed by the London clergy, and dated from Sion college, Dec. 14, 1647. It was ſubſcribed by 58 of the moſt eminent paſtors in London, 17 of whom were of the aſſembly of divines, to which 64 of the miniſters of Glouceſterſhire, 84 of Lancaſhire, 83 of Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and 71 of Somerſetſhire, ſubſcribed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0010800104:134"/>Touching errors and hereſies, they declare their deteſtation and abhorrence of the following, <hi>inter alia:</hi> "1. That the holy ſcriptures are not of divine authority, and the only rule of faith. 2. That God hath a bodily ſhape; that God is the name of a perſon; and, that God is the author of ſin, having a greater hand in it than men themſelves. 3. That there is not a Trinity of perſons in the Godhead; that the Son is not co-equal with the Father; and, that the Holy Ghoſt is only a miniſtering Spirit. 4. That God has not elected ſome to ſalvation, from eternity; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or reprobated others; and, that no man ſhall periſh in hell for Adam's ſin. 5. That Chriſt died for the ſins of all mankind; that the benefits of his death were intended for all; and that natural men may do ſuch things as whereunto God has by way of promiſe annexed grace and acceptation. 6. That man hath a free-will and power in himſelf to repent, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to obey the goſpel, and to do every thing that God requires to ſalvation. 7. That faith is not a ſupernatural grace, and that faithful actions are the only things by which a man is juſtified. 8. That the moral law is not the rule of life; that believers are as clean from ſin as Chriſt himſelf; that ſuch have no occaſion to pray for pardon for ſin; that God ſees no ſin in his people, nor does he ever chaſtiſe them for it. 9. That there is no church nor ſacraments, nor Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; the opinion of the Seekers (now called Quakers). 10. That the children of believers ought not to be baptized, nor baptiſm continued amongſt Chriſtians; that the meaning of the third commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thyſelf.</hi> 11. That perſons of the next kindred may marry; and that indiſpoſition, unfitneſs, or contrariety of mind, ariſing from natural cauſes, are a juſt reaſon of divorce. 12. That the ſoul of man is mortal; that it ſleeps with the body; and that there is neither heaven or hell till the day of judgment." They alſo witneſſed againſt the <hi>error of toleration,</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0010800104:135"/>and promoting all other errors, hereſies, and blaſphemies whatſoever, under the groſsly abuſed notion of <hi>liberty of conſcience.</hi> Herein they complain, as a very great grievance, "that men ſhould not have liberty to worſhip God, in the way and manner as ſhall appear to them moſt agreeable to the word of God, and no man be puniſhed or diſcountenanced by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the ſame; and that an inforced uniformity of religion throughout a nation or ſtate confounds the civil and religious, and denies the very principles of Chriſtianity and civility." They then bear their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the covenant, and to the divine right of Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. They lament the imperfect ſettlement of their diſcipline by the parliament, and lay the foundation of all their calamities in the countenancing a public and general toleration: and conclude, "Upon all theſe conſiderations, we, the miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, do hereby teſtify to our flocks, to all the kingdom, and to the reformed world, our great diſlike of <hi>Prelacy, Eraſtianiſm, Browniſm,</hi> and <hi>Independency;</hi> and our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abhorrence of <hi>Anti-ſcripturiſm, Popery, Ariamſm, Socinianiſm, Arminianiſm, Antinomianiſm, Anabaptiſm, Libertiniſm,</hi> and <hi>Familiſm;</hi> and that we deteſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned toleration, ſo much purſued and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this kingdom, accounting it unlawful and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious."</p>
               <p>Secondly, An extract from the <hi>ordinance againſt blaſphemy and hereſy,</hi> by the parliament; to which, when the army marched from London towards Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the deprived Preſbyterian members had returned, and, having the ſuperiority, took occaſion to diſcover their principles and ſpirit. It will hardly be credited, that perſons who had themſelves experienced all the horrors of perſecution and penal ſtatutes, ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play ſo perſecuting, ſo unchriſtian a diſpoſition. The ordinance was dated May 2, 1648, and ordains, "That all perſons who ſhall willingly maintain, publiſh, or defend, by preaching or writing, the following hereſies
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0010800104:136"/>with obſtinacy, ſhall, upon complaint or proof, by the oaths of two witneſſes, before two juſtices of the peace, or confeſſion of the party, be committed to priſon, without bail or mainprize, till the next goal-delivery; and in caſe the indictment ſhall then be found, and the party upon his trial ſhall not abjure the ſaid error, and his defence and maintenance of the ſame, he ſhall ſuffer the pains of death, as in caſe of felony, without benefit of clergy; and if he recant or abjure, he ſhall remain in priſon till he find ſureties that he will not maintain the ſaid hereſies or errors any more; but if he relapſe, and is convicted a ſecond time, he ſhall ſuffer death as before." The hereſies are as follow: "1. That there is no God. 2. That God is not omnipreſent, omniſcient, almighty, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and perfectly holy. 3. That the Father is not God, that the Son is not God, that the Holy Ghoſt is not God, or that theſe three are not one eternal God; or, that Chriſt is not God equal with the Father. 4. The denial of the manhood of Chriſt, or that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or manhood are diſtinct natures; or that the humanity of Chriſt is pure and unſpotted of all ſin. 5. The maintaining that Chriſt did not die, nor riſe again, nor aſcend into heaven bodily. 6. The denying that the death of Chriſt is meritorious on the behalf of believers; or that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. 7. The deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the holy ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament are the word of God. 8. The denying of the reſurrection of the dead, and a future judgment." Some other errors of leſs demerit are then mentioned, as, "1. That all men ſhall be ſaved. 2. That man, by nature, hath free-will to turn to God. 3. That God may be worſhipped in or by pictures or images. 4. That the ſoul dies with the body, or, after death, goes neither to heaven or hell, but to purgatory. 5. That the ſoul of man ſleeps, when the body is dead. 6. That the revelations or workings of the Spirit are a rule of faith and Chriſtian life, tho' diverſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0010800104:137"/>from, or contrary to the written word of God. 7. That man is bound to believe no more than by his reaſon he can comprehend. 8. That the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, is no rule of Chriſtian life. 9. That a believer need not repent, or pray for pardon of ſin. 10. That the two ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances commanded by the word of God. 11. That the baptiſm of infants is unlawful and void; and that ſuch perſons ought to be baptiſed again. 12. That the obſervation of the Lord's day, as injoined by the ordinances and laws of the realm, is not according, or is contrary to the word of God. 13. That it is not lawful to join in public or family prayer, or to teach children to pray. 14. That the churches (Preſbyterian) of England are no true churches, nor their miniſters and ordinances true miniſters and ordinances; or, that the church-government by Preſbyters is antichriſtian or unlawful. 15. That magiſtracy, or the power of the civil magiſtrate, by law eſtabliſhed in England, is unlawful. 16. That all uſe of arms, though for the public defence, and be the cauſe never ſo juſt, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful." Theſe hereſies and errors were taken from the ſpeeches and writings of the Papiſts, Arminians, Antinomians, Arians, Papiſts, Quakers, &amp;c. of thoſe times. "Whoſoever ſhall maintain or defend theſe laſt errors, ſhall, upon application, &amp;c. and conviction, by the oath of two witneſſes, or by his own confeſſion, &amp;c. be ordered to renounce his ſaid error or errors in the public congregation of the pariſh from whence the complaint comes, or where the offence was committed; and, in caſe of refuſal, he ſhall be committed to priſon till he find ſureties, that he ſhall not publiſh or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſaid errors any more."</p>
               <p>How different the principles of the Preſbyterians of the preſent times, the reader will preſently ſee. The Preſbyterians, under the various uſurpations, till the reſtoration of Charles II. acted in concert with the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0010800104:138"/>Scots, for reſtoring the King upon the foot of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; ſeveral of their miniſters carried on a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence privately with the chiefs of that nation; and inſtead of taking the <hi>engagement</hi> to the preſent powers, called them uſurpers, and declined praying for them in their churches; they alſo declared againſt a general to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, which the army and parliament contended for; and, to widen the breach, the latter took away all the penal ſtatutes for religion, Sept. 20, 1650, by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>While the Scots were raiſing forces for the King's ſervice, a private correſpondence was carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Preſbyterians in England and the Scots: large ſums of money were collected privately to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an expedition into England; but the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſoon defeated their deſigns, ſeveral miniſters and others were taken into cuſtody, and Mr. Love, one of them, and Mr. Gibbons, were tried and executed.</p>
               <p>Under Oliver Cromwell's uſurpation, though their diſcipline was diſarmed of its co-ercive power, he ſtill left them all that was ſufficient for religious purpoſes; they had their monthly or quarterly claſſical preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in every county, for the ordination of miniſters, by impoſition of hands, according to the directory. In the diſtant counties they entered into friendly aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations for brotherly counſel and advice, and were ſtill retained in the public miniſtry; but as the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was for the liberty of conſcience, their church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were now of no force, and the churches were indiſcriminately beſtowed on miniſters of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants and other perſuaſions.</p>
               <p>Upon Richard Cromwell's reſigning the protecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the Preſbyterians ſeeing no probability of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the covenant, or coming into power by the rump parliament, which was principally made up of enthuſiaſts and declared enemies to monarchy, they entered into a ſort of confederacy with the royaliſts to reſtore the King and the old conſtitution; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0010800104:139"/>of their miniſters appeared in the inſurrection of Sir George Booth, a Preſbyterian, in Cheſhire, whoſe party however was defeated by General Lambert.</p>
               <p>General Monk having reſtored the ſecluded mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of 1648, to their ſeats in the houſe, who were of the Preſbyterian party, they then carried all before them, and the city-miniſters petitioned the parliament to take a more effectual courſe againſt Papiſts; to prohibit the Quakers opening their ſhops on the Sabbath-day, and that the public miniſters may not be diſturbed in their public ſervices. They alſo beſought them to eſtabliſh the aſſembly's confeſſion, directory and catechiſms, &amp;c. &amp;c. All or moſt of theſe things the houſe complied with, and they ordered the ſolemn league and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to be reprinted, and ſet up in every church in England, and read publickly by the miniſter, once every year: the preſbytery was reſtored to all its powers, and the miniſters of that perſuaſion were put in full poſſeſſion of all the livings in England. By their credulity, and the artifices of General Monk, they were made to believe that preſbytery was to be the eſtabliſhed government of the church of England, alſo, under King Charles II. in whoſe reſtoration they heartily concurred, and in fact brought it about, which they were capable of doing, as they were at that time in poſſeſſion of the whole power of England; the council of ſtate, the chief officers of the army and navy, and the governors of the chief forts and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were theirs; and their clergy were in poſſeſſion not only of the livings, but of both univerſities. In ſhort, they brought in the King without any ſtipulation or conceſſion on his part. Strange infatuation, which they ſoon after had reaſon to repent! For they might be ſure that the old conſtitution muſt return with the King; that dioceſan Epiſcopacy was the only legal eſtabliſhment; and that all that had been done in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of preſbytery, not having had the royal aſſent, was void in law: therefore they and their friends who had
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0010800104:140"/>not Epiſcopal ordination and induction into their livings, muſt be looked upon as intruders, and not legal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church of England. The King, to carry on the farce, as it was really on his ſide, when the miniſters waited upon him in Holland, gave them ſuch encouraging promiſes as raiſed in ſome of them high expectations. When he came to Whitehall, he made ten of them his chaplains
<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe were Doctors Reynolds, Spurſtow, Wallis, Manton, Bates; and Meſſ. Calamy, Aſhe, Caſe, Baxter and Woodbridge.</note>, at the inſtance of the Earl of Mancheſter; but before the expiration of the year 1660, many of the parochial clergy were proſecuted for not uſing the book of Common Prayer; the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and others inſiſting, that the laws returned with the King, and that they ought not to be diſpenſed with in the neglect of them. The ſequeſtered clergy came out of their hiding places, and took poſſeſſion of their former livings, by which ſome hundreds of the preſbyterian clergy were at once diſpoſſeſſed. The two univerſities were reſtored to their old diſcipline and government, and the heads of colleges, &amp;c. &amp;c. ejected in 1648, were put in again. New creations were made in both univerſities, in favour of any, almoſt, who would declare their averſion to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and hearty affection of Epiſcopal government. Deans and Chapters were alſo again reſtored, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were promoted to the vacant ſees; and thus the church of England was reſtored to its former power, except only the peerage of the Biſhops
<note n="†" place="bottom">"No period of time, ſince the reformation, had more of the ſpirit and appearance of religion, nor leſs open profaneneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, (than under the late governments). Perhaps there was a little too much rigour and preciſeneſs in indifferent matters, which might be thought running into a contrary extreme. But the luſts of men were laid under a very great reſtraint; better laws were never made againſt vice, and never better put in execution. The dreſs, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and converſation of people was ſober and virtuous, and their manner of houſe-keeping remarkably frugal. There was hardly a ſingle bankruptcy to be heard of in a year: the vices of drunkenneſs, fornication, profane ſwearing, and every kind of debauchery, were baniſhed, and out of faſhion. The clergy were laborious to exceſs in preaching and praying, in catechiſing youth, and viſiting their pariſhes. The magiſtrates did their duty in ſuppreſſing all kinds of games, ſtage-plays, and abuſes in public houſes. There was not a play acted in England for almoſt twenty years. The Lord's day was obſerved with unuſual ſtrictneſs, and there were a ſet of as learned and pious youths in the univerſity as had been known. So that if ſuch a reformation of manners had obtained under a legal adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would have deſerved the character of the beſt of times." —"But when the legal conſtitution was reſtored, there came in with it a torrent of all kinds of debauchery and wickedneſs. Men ſet no bounds to their vicious appetites. Two play-houſes were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, women-actreſſes introduced upon the Engliſh ſtage; the moſt lewd and obſcene plays were acted; nothing was to be ſeen at court but feaſting, hard drinking, revelling, and amorous intrigues, which produced the moſt enormous vices. The common people threw off the very profeſſion of virtue and piety: the appearance of religion in any one furniſhed matter of ridicule to the profane mockers of real piety. To appear ſerious, to make a conſcience of one's words and actions, was the way to be avoided as a ſchiſmatic, a ſanatic, or a ſectarian. They who did not applaud the revived ceremonies were marked out for Preſbyterians, and every Preſbyterian was a rebel. The reſtored perſons were notoriouſly vicious and ſcandalous. Such was the general diſſoluteneſs of manners which attended the tide of joy that overflowed the nation upon his Majeſty's reſtoration." <hi>Neale,</hi> and to the ſame effect all other hiſtorians.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0010800104:141"/>The King and the Duke of York were for a general toleration, in order to include the Papiſts; and the Biſhops, and Lord Clarendon at their head, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any comprehenſion for, or conceſſions to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbyterians. The reaſons of the Biſhops angry beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour were, "their high notions of the Epiſcopal form of government, as eſſentially neceſſary to the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Chriſtian church: The reſentments that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their breaſts againſt all who had engaged with the long parliament, and had been the cauſe of their ſufferings: The Preſbyterians being legally poſſeſſed of moſt of the benefices in church and ſtate, it was thought neceſſary to diſpoſſeſs them; and, if there muſt be a ſchiſm, rather to have it out of the church than within it." For it had been obſerved, that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0010800104:142"/>half-conformity of the Puritans before the war, had in moſt cities and corporations occaſioned a faction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the main body and the lecturers, which latter had endeavoured to make themſelves popular at the expence of the hierarchy of the church. Beſides, the Preſbyterians had too much credit in the elections of parliament-men: therefore they reſolved (ſays Burnet) to ſeek the moſt effectual means to caſt them out of the church.</p>
               <p>The well meaning Preſbyterians were, therefore, ſtriving againſt the ſtream, and making intereſt with a ſet of men, who were now laughing in their ſleeves at the abject condition to which the folly of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries had reduced them. "They offered Archbiſhop Uſher's model of primitive Epiſcopacy, as a plan of accommodation; that the ſurplice, the croſs in baptiſm, and kneeling at the communion, ſhould be left indifferent; they were content to ſet aſide the aſſembly's confeſſion, and let the articles of the church of England take place, with ſome amendments." His Majeſty deſired a number of their miniſters, who were introduced to him by the Earl of Mancheſter, to crave his interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for reconciling the differences of the church, to draw up ſuch propoſals as they thought meet, for an agreement about church-government, and to ſet down the moſt they could yield. Accordingly the city-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with ſome of their country brethren, met at Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on college, and after two or three weeks deliberation agreed upon a paper, which, together with Archbiſhop Uſher's reduction of Epiſcopacy, they offered to the King with a proper addreſs. To this paper the Biſhops publiſhed a reply; upon which the Preſbyterians ſent a warm remonſtrance to the Biſhops, and a defence of their propoſals; which concludes thus, "We perceive your <hi>counſels againſt peace</hi> are not likely to be fruſtrated. Your deſires concerning us are likely to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. You are like to be gratified with our ſilence and ejection; and yet we will believe, that <hi>bleſſed are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0010800104:143"/>the peace-makers;</hi> and though we are prevented by you in our purſuits of peace, and are never like, thus publickly, to ſeek it more, yet are we reſolved, as much as poſſible, to live peaceably with all men."</p>
               <p>Their eyes now began to open, and they perceived, with regret, their credulity in expecting an agreement with the Biſhops, who appeared to be exaſperated, and determined to bind them over to the old eſtabliſhment. The former ſeverities were already revived, and the laws to be put in execution againſt ſuch as did not make uſe of the old liturgy. Many were ſuſpended and turned out of their livings on this account. Upon application for redreſs to the King, he told them he would put what he thought fit to grant them into the form of a declaration, which they ſhould peruſe before it was made public. A copy was accordingly delivered to them, with liberty to make exceptions: they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for ſome further amendments and alterations; upon which the King appointed a day to hear what could be ſaid on both ſides, and came to Chancellor Hyde's houſe, October 22, 1660, attended by the Dukes of Albemarle and Ormond, the Earls of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter and Angleſea, and Lord Hollis, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">On the part of the Biſhops were Dr. Sheldon Biſhop of London; Morley of Worceſter; Henchman of Saliſbury; Coſins of Durham; Gauden of Exeter; Hacket of Litchfield and Coventry; Dr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Dean of St. Paul's, and Dr. Gunning, &amp;c. On the ſide of the Preſbyterians, Dr. Reynolds, Mr. Calamy, Dr. Spurſtow, Mr. Aſhe, Dr. Manton, Mr. Baxter, and Dr. Wallis.</note>. As the Chancellor read over the declaration, each party were to make their exceptions, and the King to determine. The chief debates were on the high powers of the Biſhops, and the neceſſity of re-ordination. Upon hearing the whole, the King told them what he thought proper ſhould ſtand in the declaration; and appointed Biſhops Morley and Henchman, Dr. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, and Mr. Calamy, to determine upon proper words, and, if they diſagreed, the Earl of Angleſea and Lord
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0010800104:144"/>Hollis were to decide. If this declaration did not pleaſe all the miniſters, the greateſt number in London and the country were content; but as it went upon the plan of dioceſan Epiſcopacy, which they had cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted againſt, others were not ſatisfied. Some of them ventured upon a ſecond addreſs to the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing their requeſts for Archbiſhop Uſher's plan, &amp;c. However, the Preſbyterians about London were ſo much pleaſed, that they drew up a warm addreſs of thanks to the King, which was preſented November 16
<note n="*" place="bottom">Upon the terms of this declaration, ſays Neale, Dr. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds accepted the biſhopric of Norwich; Mr. Baxter was offered the biſhopric of Hereford, but refuſed it upon other reaſons, and Mr. Calamy declined that of Litchfield and Coventry, till the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſſed into a law. Dr. Manton having been preſented to the living of Covent-Garden, by the Earl of Bedford, accepted it upon the declaration, and received Epiſcopal inſtitution from the hands of Sheldon, Biſhop of London, January 10, 1660-1, <hi>Subſcriptis prius articulis fidei eccleſiae</hi> Anglicanae <hi>tantum &amp; praeſtito juramento de allegiant' &amp; ſupremitate, &amp; canonica obedientia in omnibus licitis &amp; honeſtis.</hi> The Doctor was alſo content that the <hi>common prayer book ſhould be read in his church.</hi> Dr. Bates was offered the deanery of Coventry and Litchfield; Dr. Manton the deanery of Rocheſter; and Mr. Bowles that of York: but finding how things were going at court, after ſome time, they refuſed.</note>.</p>
               <p>When the parliament read the King's declaration, they agreed to wait upon him in a body, and return him thanks; notwithſtanding which, the bill, to paſs into a law, was rejected by the Houſe of Commons after the firſt reading
<note n="†" place="bottom">This blunted all the expectations of the Preſbyterian clergy at once; for it was now apparent, that the court did not deſign the declaration ſhould be continued, but only ſerve as a temporary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, to keep them in quiet until the church ſhould be in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to bid them defiance. <hi>Neale.</hi>

               <p>From this time perſecution againſt the Preſbyterians commenced. One Mr. Zach. Crofton was impriſoned and turned out of his living, for writing in favour of the covenant, tho' he had a wife and ſeven children, and had been remarkably zealous for the reſtoration. Another (Mr. Parſons, rector of Wem, in Shropſhire) was taken from his wife by ſoldiers, for ſeditious preaching and non-conformity to the ceremonies, and fined two hundred pounds, with impriſonment till paid. "Spies (ſays Mr. Neale) were ſent into all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Preſbyterians throughout England, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and report their behaviour to the biſhops; and if a miniſter lamented the degeneracy of the times, or expreſſed his concern for the <hi>ark of God;</hi> if he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt perfidiouſneſs, or glanced at the vices of the court, he was marked for an enemy of the King and government. Many eminent and loyal Preſbyterians were ſent to priſon upon ſuch informations, and when they came to their trials, the court was guarded with ſoldiers, and their friends not ſuffered to attend them. Many were ſequeſtered from their livings, and cited into the eccleſiaſtical courts, for not uſing the ſurplice and other ceremonies, whilſt the diſcipline of the church was under a kind of ſuſpenſion. So eager were the ſpiritual courts to revive the exerciſe of their power; and ſo ſtrongly did the tide run againſt the unhappy Preſbyterians!" By the act for reſtoring the old ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered clergy, ſome hundreds of the non-conformiſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0010800104:146"/>miniſters were diſpoſſeſed of their livings, before the act of <hi>uniformity</hi> was formed. "Here was no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between good and bad; but if the perſon had been epiſcopally ordained, and in poſſeſſion, he muſt be reſtored, tho' he had been ejected upon the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evidence of immorality or ſcandal." The miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſoon after did every thing in their power to throw the odium of plots and conſpiracies upon the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, for which many were taken into cuſtody, but releaſed afterwards, without proſecution; by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they facilitated the paſſing the penal ſtatutes that were coming upon the carpet. They could not, conſiſtent with the declaration from Breda, or with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, attack the Preſbyterians purely upon account of their religion; they were therefore to be accuſed, right or wrong, of raiſing diſturbances in the ſtate. By the act <hi>for the well-governing and regulating corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> all non-conformiſts were turned out of every branch of magiſtracy at once, and could not ſerve their country, even in the meaneſt offices of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>council man, or a burgeſs or bailiff of a corporation. Commiſſioners appointed hereupon were ſent to viſit the ſeveral corporations, who executed their commiſſion ſo rigorouſly, that every member of them was turned out who was not entirely devoted to the King and church.</p>
               <p>The Savoy conference ended without any good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the act of uniformity received the royal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, May 19, 1662, by which the terms of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity were higher than before the civil wars, and the common-prayer book rendered more exceptionable. By inforcing this act
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Vol. III, of this work, p. 459—464.</note>, the calamities of the ejected mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were very terrible. "Many hundreds of them (ſays Baxter) with their wives and children, had neither houſe nor bread; the people thus left were not able to relieve them, nor durſt they if they had been able, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0010800104:148"/>Various were the hardſhips and perſecutions of the Preſbyterians before the fire of London, the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and miniſtry diſcovering on every occaſion an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting animoſity to them; and if the King ſhewed any compaſſion, it was purely owing to his deſire of eaſing the Papiſts from their difficulties, by a general toleration. Even that awful viſitation the great plague gave them no reſpite; but regardleſs of the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Heaven, the miniſtry and biſhops purſued them with the more malignant barbarity. After the fire of London they were ſomewhat connived at, they built wooden tabernacles to preach in, and their places of worſhip were crowded with penitent and devout au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. The diſgrace of their bitter enemy the Earl of Clarendon was likewiſe favourable to them; but after a ſhort reſpite, and ſeveral attempts for a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comprehenſion had failed, the perſecution was revived in the year 1668, and their private meetings were broken up again, Mr. Baxter and other learned and pious preachers impriſoned, and they were abuſed in many hot writings, particularly by Dr. Patrick and Dr. Parker, (afterwards Biſhops) but the latter was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and farcaſtically anſwered by the famous Andrew Marvel. In 1670, the conventicle-act was revived, which the court forwarded with a view of reducing the Preſbyterians to the neceſſity of petitioning for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral toleration, by which a door would be opened for the introduction of popery
<note n="*" place="bottom">The wit of man could hardly invent any thing ſhort of capital puniſhment, more cruel and inhuman, than this act, by which means houſes were to be plundered, their perſons impriſoned, their goods and chattles carried away, and ſold to thoſe that would bid for them, and encouragement given to a vile ſet of informers to live upon the labour and induſtry of their conſcientious neighbours. <hi>Neale.</hi>
                  </note>. The act was ſo ſeverely executed, that there was ſoon not a conventicle to be heard of all over England. Great numbers were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted on it, and many induſtrious families reduced to poverty. Many miniſters were confined in goals and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0010800104:149"/>cloſe priſons; and warrants were iſſued out againſt them and their hearers, and diſtraints made, to the amount of a great ſum of money. Informers were every where at work, and having crept into religious aſſemblies, in diſguiſe, levied great ſums upon mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people. Soldiers broke into the houſes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt farmers, under pretence of ſearching for conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and where ready money was wanting, they plundered their goods, drove away their cattle, and ſold them for half price; even the ſick had their beds taken from under them, and themſelves laid upon the floor. During the time that Charles's declaration of indulgence
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Vol. III. of this work, p. 462.</note> continued in force, the Preſbyterians and Independants ſet up the merchants lecture at Pinners hall, to ſhew their agreement among themſelves, as well as to ſupport the doctrines of the reformation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prevailing errors of Popery, &amp;c. ſupported by the contributions of the principal merchants and tradeſmen of their perſuaſions in the city. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued united till 1695, when the Preſbyterians removed to Salters hall, and the Independants continued their lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at Pinners hall, both which have continued ever ſince. The teſt-act of 1673 was the laſt penal ſtatute againſt the non-conformiſts in this reign
<note n="†" place="bottom">See ibid. p. 463.</note>; and as the Diſſenters in general had, with great generoſity, ſupported that meaſure againſt the court, through their dread of the increaſe of Popery, the court next year let looſe again all their engines of cruelty upon them, and the fines, impriſonments and other ſeverities exerciſed were exceſſive. Thence to the year 1681, various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made, by the ſucceſſive parliaments, for a toleration of Diſſenters, and putting the laws in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt Popiſh recuſants, and many books and pamphlets were publiſhed in their defence, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably vindicated their principles. But in that year, and to the end of this reign, ſham plots were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0010800104:150"/>contrived, to render them odious, and ſet on by the court and the Papiſts, they felt all the rage of the high church-party, who diſplayed their hatred by encouraging infamous informers, and inflicting exorbitant fines and cruel impriſonments, under which many pious and learned divines found a refuge in death from all their troubles.</p>
               <p>I have now gone as comprehenſively as I could thro' this gloomy reign, in which ſo many thouſands of pious and good perſons were ruined for conſcience ſake; but it muſt be remembered, that the public liberty was ruined with them, and that the whole conſtitution, at the time of Charles's death, was in a manner brought to its diſſolution. Yet, when the nation was groaning under every oppreſſion, when every vice ſtalked abroad in open day light, and corruption of manners, and proſtitution of heart and tongue, were even faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, remember, readers, and bluſh for your country, there were wretches abandoned enough to addreſs this voluptuous Monarch, in ſtrains that were impious, and could with propriety be only aſcribed to God himſelf.</p>
               <p>James II. at the beginning of his ſhort reign, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the perſecution againſt the Proteſtant Diſſenters, the majority of whom were Preſbyterians; which was carried on with the moſt barbarous rigour, and even exceeded thoſe in his brother's reign; but the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſcheme, which had proved abortive under that Prince, was ſedulouſly purſued by James, of making the Preſbyterians and other Diſſenters tools to obtain a general toleration, by which the Papiſts were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the penal laws and teſts. As he imagined it impracticable to obtain his deſire legally, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to attempt it by his <hi>diſpenſing power,</hi> and began to careſs the Non-conformiſts, and to ſhow them great favour; their miniſters were encouraged to ſet up their conventicles, which had been diſcontinued or held very ſecretly for ſome years; and the King had it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0010800104:151"/>timated every where, that he would not have their meetings diſturbed. But the Diſſenters ſeeing the King's drift, now joined with their perſecutors of the Church of England, generouſly giving up their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reſentments, however juſt, to their fears of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and ſlavery, which were making large ſtrides to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the deſtruction of religious and civil liberty, of which the <hi>diſpenſing power,</hi> and the <hi>declaration for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience,</hi> were to be the principal engines
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol iii. of this work, p. 465, <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                  </note>. This wiſe conduct of the Diſſenters certainly ſaved the church and ſtate.</p>
               <p>Thus, however, an end was put to the proſecution of the Proteſtant Diſſenters by the penal laws, though the laws themſelves were not legally repealed or ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till after the revolution
<note n="†" place="bottom">Upwards of ſixty thouſand perſons ſuffered upon a religious account between the reſtoration and the abdication of King James, five thouſand of whom died in priſon. Great numbers retired to the plantations, and many tranſported themſelves and their effects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holland, and filled the Engliſh churches in the cities of the States. Neale ſays, "If we admit the diſſenting families of the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations in England to be no more than 150,000, and that each family ſuffered no more than the loſs of three or four pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> from the act of uniformity, the whole will amount to 12 or 14,000,000, a prodigious ſum for thoſe times! But theſe are only conjectures; the damage to the trade and property of the nation was undoubtedly immenſe; and the wounds that were made in the eſtates of private families were deep and large; many of whom, to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wear the ſcars of them to this day."</note>.</p>
               <p>Tho' in purſuance of the declarations for liberty of conſcience, &amp;c. the Diſſenters were not only at their liberty to worſhip in their ſeveral ways, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſerve in all offices of profit and truſt, they could not be brought to acknowledge <hi>diſpenſing power;</hi> tho' many to them addreſſed the King with thanks for the freedom they now enjoyed from perſecution; a meaſure, however, that was not approved by their elders and more cautious miniſters. In ſhort, they were now courted both by King and church; by the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0010800104:152"/>latter of which they were promiſed, <hi>in caſe they now ſtood firm to the common intereſt, they would in better time come into a comprehenſion of ſuch as could be brought into a conjunction with the church, and to a toleration of the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Preſbyterians concurred heartily in the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and when the Prince of Orange came to St. James's, December 18, 1688, ſeveral of their miniſters attended him, with the Biſhop of London, and many of the clergy, to congratulate him upon his ſucceſs. January 2, about ninety of the Non-conformiſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters waited upon the Prince with a ſeparate addreſs, to which they received a moſt cordial anſwer. When King William and Queen Mary were ſettled on the throne, the Diſſenting miniſters waited on their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties with addreſſes of congratulation, which were delivered by Dr. Bates: and though many generous attempts made by the King for a comprehenſion were rendered abortive by the oppoſition of the Jacobites and Tories; yet the memorable bill <hi>for toleration of Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> which is the baſis of their preſent liberty, was paſſed in their favour

               <p>Little elſe has occurred ſince that happy aera, of the revolution, but fruitleſs attempts for a repeal of the corporation and teſt acts, which have been conſtantly oppoſed by the church of England: but it is to be hoped ſome future time will reſtore the Diſſenters to that entire liberty which is the birth-right of every Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman, and that they may have the privilege of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their country indiſcriminately with their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjects of the eſtabliſhed church, which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, upon their preſent principles, wiſh overturned; though they may deſire that the ſtumbling blocks to their union therewith were removed.</p>

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0010800104:153"/>I now come to give ſome account of the religious principles of the Preſbyterians, who continue to be the moſt numerous ſect of Proteſtant Diſſenters in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and have almoſt entirely forſaken the rigid and ſevere maxims of their fore-fathers.</p>

No recourſe can be had here to an antecedent corruption. Adam, therefore, was not guilty of the firſt ſin; and if Adam was not, much leſs are we; and not being guilty of the firſt ſin, we are not accountable for the corruption which is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to human nature, nor the cauſe of God's predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to actions on account of this corruption.

                  <p>The ſacrament of baptiſm, is that wherein by being waſhed with water, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the baptized perſon ſolemnly gives up himſelf to God, through his Son, to be governed by the goſpel he taught, in expectation of the aids of that Spirit, whoſe miraculous gifts proved the truth of the goſpel; and whereby he obliges himſelf to forſake all his former impurities, which he thus acknowledges, while,

                  <p>Touching eccleſiaſtical authority, this can by no means bind the conſcience; for, in all ſuch caſes, the only foundation upon which a man can act conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, is his private perſuaſion; it limits and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the extent of human authority and is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and circumſcribed by it; if a deciſion of men binds any perſon, it is in matters wherein he thinks they have power; when they carry their pretenſions farther, and determine things wherein his judgment does not allow their authority, their decrees muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by him as void; and, conſequently, if any one's conſcience diſſallows human authority, in the loweſt inſtances wherein it is exerciſed, its acts can produce no obligation upon him; elſe the rights of private judgment might be invaded in all caſes, and conſcience given up to the will of men; for it is as really injured if a man be forced to act againſt its light, in a circumſtance or matter of ceremony, as an article of faith; for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin; from whence it is plain, that eccleſiaſtical authority has no power over conſcience; indeed none at all but what conſcience gives it, and therefore muſt yield to its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior where their voices differ.</p>

The firſt and great article of my belief (from natural and revealed religion) is the exiſtence of one God, whoſe power is uncontroulable, whoſe knowledge is infinite, whoſe preſence is immenſity, whoſe being is eternity, whoſe beneficence is boundleſs mercy, whoſe name is love, a Spirit immutable in his nature, and unchangeable in all his perfections; the Creator of all worlds, and of all beings that exiſt.—I believe that his providence is univerſal, and that his ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is over all his works; exerciſed with the moſt perſect wiſdom, and invariable goodneſs, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his own glory and the happineſs of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—I believe that this all-wife and good God

We, your brethren in Chriſt, are at your requeſt here aſſembled in the preſence of God, and of this congregation, to acknowledge, receive, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you, in the full exerciſe of that Chriſtian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for which you have been prepared by a regular and learned education; and we do it with the greater pleaſure, as during ſeveral years you have given ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory proof of your abilities, and qualifications for it, as an aſſiſtant miniſter in this church.</p>
                  <p>We pretend to no dominion over your faith, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to inveſt you with any new powers or rights, by the impoſition of our hands; which we retain only as an ancient rite or ceremony whereby we bear our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and ſolemn teſtimony, that we eſteem you worthy of that ſacred miniſtry which you have choſen to devote yourſelf to, and of diſcharging all the paſtoral duties without exception, which Chriſt has appointed to be performed in his church, recommending you to God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0010800104:171"/>by prayer, and to the church of Chriſt by our unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſuffrages.</p>
                  <p>We preſume not to offer to you any articles of faith or religion in the words of men, or canons of human contrivance, for your aſſent and ſubſcription. But as there is a propriety in the thing itſelf, and as it is the religion of Chriſt only, in its native and uncorrupted ſimplicity, of which we would be underſtood to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and declare you a miniſter, will you give us, on this occaſion, your own ideas of the general plan of that excellent and divine religion of Jeſus Chriſt, which has been, and is from henceforth, by this ſolemn dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of yourſelf to it, to be the chief and important ſubject of the labours of your life?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the view, Sir, that you are pleaſed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it, I readily conſent to lay before you, and this aſſembly, a general account of the religious principles which I profeſs, and apprehend I have drawn from the pure fountains of religious knowledge.</p>
                  <p>By the exerciſe of my rational powers upon myſelf and other objects, I am led into the firm belief of the exiſtence of an eternal, independent, immenſe Being, which we call God, poſſeſſed of infinite power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, with all conceivable, all poſſible perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, character, and ſtate; the original cauſe of all other beings, the ſource of all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, perfection, and happineſs that obtain in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; the preſerver of the whole world, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous governor and judge of moral agents, amongſt whom is the race of mankind.</p>
                  <p>But the character and moral government of this glorious Being, eſpecially his diſpenſations towards the human race, with their duty, are more particularly and clearly repreſented in the ſcriptures, which are of divine original, and contain a juſt account of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truth relating to religion.</p>
                  <p>From them I learn, that the ſupreme governor of the world, to ſhew his diſpleaſure againſt ſin, baniſhed our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0010800104:172"/>firſt parents from paradiſe in which he had placed them, for diſobedience to a poſitive prohibition; and inflicted upon them the penalty threatened to their tranſgreſſion, though not without giving them the promiſe of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer from the evils to which they had ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>In the ſucceeding ages of the world this promiſe was repeated for the encouragement of well-diſpoſed perſons; and various means were made uſe of by the wiſe and and merciful God, to preſerve or reſtore true religion amongſt men; particularly it was renewed to Abraham, one branch of whoſe family he choſe and diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the world by peculiar laws and rites of worſhip, to convey to poſterity the knowledge of this promiſe with ſeveral important doctrines and duties of religion.</p>
                  <p>At the time appointed by infinite wiſdom, as moſt proper for it, he ſent the long-expected perſon into the world, to ſave men from perdition, and bring them to everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>The well-beloved Son of God, in obedience to his Father, and from compaſſion to mankind, took fleſh, and was born of a Virgin, lived in a mean condition, converſed familiarly with men, taught the great doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and duties of true religion, then very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and neglected, corrupted by traditions, and human inventions; illuſtrated by his own temper and conduct the pure doctrines and rules of duty which he taught; ſetting an example of ſtrict purity, of warm benevolence, of ſublime piety, of univerſal holineſs; and proved alſo his divine commiſſion and character, as the Meſſiah, by miraculous works.</p>
                  <p>Thus did this divine teacher proceed for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, gloriouſly diſplaying the excellency of the divine perfections and government, and his own good will to mankind, till he was ſeized by wicked men, who unjuſtly condemned and crucified him. But the violent oppoſition which they made to his cauſe, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0010800104:173"/>the evils they inflicted on his perſon, were ſo far from fruſtrating the great deſign on which he came into the world, from putting a ſtop to the exerciſe of his piety to God, and his beneficence to men, that they afforded him an opportunity of promoting it in the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner; for as by theſe laſt ſufferings he ſet us an example of a ſteady adherence to the cauſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under the greateſt natural and temporal evils that can befal us, ſo in death he gave himſelf for us an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and a ſacrifice to God of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he long remain under the dominion of death, for on the third day he was raiſed again by the mighty power of God; appeared to, and converſed with many of his diſciples, eſpecially the Apoſtles, who were particularly appointed to be witneſſes of this great event, by which he was declared in the moſt convincing manner, to be the Son of God and Saviour of the world. And after converſing with them ſeveral times for the ſpace of forty days, and inſtructing them in the things relating to the kingdom of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to proſelyte all nations, baptiſing them into the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve whatever he had commanded them; he was taken up into heaven from among them, and ſeated at the right-hand of the Majeſty on high, as a Prince and a Saviour to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſins unto all people.</p>
                  <p>Veſted with all power both in heaven and earth, ſoon after his aſcenſion, he conferred the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, which qualified them in the beſt manner for propagating his religion in the world.</p>
                  <p>This religion, as publiſhed by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and contained in the ſcriptures, is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and perfect inſtitution, admirably adapted to the ſtate and circumſtances of mankind. It contains the laws of nature, with various additional directions, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances, promiſes, and motives ſuited to our unhappy circumſtances of ignorance, weakneſs, and guilt, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0010800104:174"/>directly tending to promote our purity, comfort, and eternal felicity. For as it has provided a remedy for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For preſerving the knowledge of this excellent reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and accompliſhing its ends in the world it is agreeable to the will of Chriſt that ſocieties be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which the doctrines and duties of his goſpel are taught and inculcated, and the Father worſhipped through him, the only Mediator between God and men. And he appointed two peculiar ſervices of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to be obſerved only once, as a token of admiſſion into his church, and of a right to the bleſſings of his kingdom; the latter to be celebrated often, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his dying for us, and as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our Chriſtian obligations.</p>
                  <p>Though the apoſtolic office ceaſed with the lives of thoſe who were firſt ordained to it by Chriſt himſelf, yet it is ſuitable to his directions, that paſtors and teachers be continued throughout all ages, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his religion, offering up prayers, and adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ordinances.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the gifts which were conferred on the firſt miniſters of the goſpel are not continued, I apprehend that faithful diligent men, who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to reading, meditation, and prayer, that they may underſtand the will of God, enter into the true
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0010800104:175"/>ſpirit of the goſpel, and qualify themſelves for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the duties of the Chriſtian miniſtry, have encouragement to hope for a bleſſing on their ſtudies and labours from the Head of the church. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently as this kingdom is conſtituted, and well as it is furniſhed with means for its preſervation and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is not left to the mere natural operation of thoſe means, but our Lord conſtantly preſides in it, directing its affairs, and by his influence promoting the improvement and happineſs of his diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Thus does our Lord exerciſe his power and grace towards mankind at preſent; but they will be more ſenſibly and gloriouſly diſplayed hereafter, when, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from heaven in his own and his Father's glory, he ſhall raiſe the dead, convene all men before his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, with unerring judgment ſeparate the good from the bad; and aſſigning the wicked to miſery propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their guilt, ſhall reward the righteous with everlaſting life and happineſs, riſing according to the perfection of their obedience and holineſs, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above their deſerts. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall deliver up the kingdom unto the Father, that God may be all in all.</p>
                  <p>This I ſincerely deliver as a general idea of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which I firmly believe; and according to which I hope, by divine aſſiſtance, to form both my public and private conduct, that I may ſave myſelf and others.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The church of Rome appears to me to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent not only in her ceremonies, and many of her doctrines, but in her very ſpirit and conſtitution from the church of Chriſt; particularly, as ſhe claims do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the faith and religious practice of men, and inforceth her injunctions by the terrors of this world, without which her anathemas are objects of contempt: and I avow it as a fundamental principle of Chriſtianity, "That every man hath a right, and is required by Chriſt, to judge for himſelf in matters of religion, and to act agreeably to his own judgment, formed by the holy ſcriptures, which is the only rule of faith and practice to Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore but look upon the Reformation as a neceſſary, and, as far as it hath proceeded, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent work; and heartily pray that all who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the authority of the church of Rome, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her impoſing ſpirit, with all her corruptions of the Chriſtian religion.</p>

                  <p>

The acknowledging this authority would be in an high degree improper, as I do not find that Chriſt hath delegated ſuch power to any man, or
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0010800104:177"/>body of men, on earth, and ſeems to me to be directly inconſiſtent with allegiance to him who is the ſole head and lawgiver of the Chriſtian church

<note n="†" place="bottom">Some of their reaſons for ſeparating from the church were, That the laws and the Queen's injunctions had made many unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable additions to the inſtitutions of Chriſt: That there were ſeveral groſs errors in the church-ſervice, which were made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for communion, and impoſed accordingly: That if perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for conſcience ſake was the mark of a falſe church, the church of England could not be a true one: That the conſtitution of the hierarchy was too bad to be mended; that the very pillars of it were rotten, and that the ſtructure ſhould be begun anew: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reſolved to lay a new foundation, as near as poſſible to the primitive pattern, though with the hazard of all that was dear to them in the world.</note>.</p>

<note n="†" place="bottom">He was born in Kent, and educated in St. Mary hall, was precentor of Chriſt's church college, Oxon, and afterwards was rector of Cheriton, in Kent.</note>, one of the former exiles, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with Mr. Robinſon

Mr. Jacob was ſucceeded in his paſtoral charge by Mr. Lathorp; but the little ſociety being diſcovered by the Biſhop's purſuivant, April 29, 1632, at a houſe in Blackfriars, forty-two of them were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, only eighteen eſcaping. Some of thoſe that were made priſoners were confined in the Clink, others in New Priſon and the Gatehouſe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there two years or more, and were then ſuffered to be bailed out. But no favour could be obtained for their paſtor; upon which he petitioned the King for liberty to depart the kingdom, which was granted; and, in 1634, he, with about thirty of his followers, went and ſettled in New England. Mr. Canne

Mr. Samuel Howe was their next paſtor, who was thrown into priſon, where he died. Mr. Stephen More, a layman, ſucceeded him; and now, 1640-41, the times being more favourable, after ſhifting about from place to place for ſo many years, they ventured to meet in public, in Deadman's place, Southwark, on the 18th of January.

<note n="*" place="bottom">The latter charge they conſeſſed, and declared as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, "That they could acknowledge no other head of the church but Chriſt; that they apprehended no Prince on earth had power to make laws to bind the conſcience; and that ſuch laws as were contrary to the laws of God ought not to be obeyed; but that they diſowned all foreign power and juriſdiction."</note> The houſe, however, ſo much the times were changed, inſtead of referring them to the eccleſiaſtical courts, diſmiſſed them with a gentle reprimand; and the next Lord's-day, ſome of the members came out of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to their aſſembly, to hear their preaching, and to ſee their adminiſtration of the ſacrament, and were ſo much pleaſed as to contribute to their collection for the poor.</p>
               <p>Many of their miniſters, now returned from exile, ſat in the famous Weſtminſter aſſembly of divines, and made a bold ſtand againſt the proceedings of the high Preſbyterians; they had increaſed prodigiouſly by this time; and preſented <hi>an apologetical narration</hi> to the houſe of Commons, to remove all the cenſures and ill-natured ſuggeſtions againſt them
<note n="†" place="bottom">After expreſſing great charity for other churches, they ſay the ſcheme they embraced was a middle way between Browniſm and Preſbyterianiſm, viz.

This they are ſure muſt have been the form of government in the primitive church. Not that they claim an entire independency with regard to other churches for they agree, that, in all occaſions of offences, the offending church is to ſubmit to an open examination by other neighbouring churches, and on their perſiſting in their error or miſcarriage, they then are to renounce all Chriſtian communion with them, until they repent, which is all the authority or eccleſiaſtical power that one church may exerciſe over another, unleſs they call in the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, for which they find no authority in ſcripture.

It was ſigned by Thomas Goodwin, Sydrach Sympſon, Philip Nye, Jer. Burroughs, and William Narus.

<note n="‡" place="bottom">See p. 126 of this volume.</note>; but it ſhould be remarked, that as the preſbyterial form of church-government was eſtabliſhed, the Independants mildly moved only for an indulgence or toleration, which was refuſed them. They ſeemed, in fact, not only concerned for themſelves, but for tender conſciences of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. At this time the Independants were courted by the King; but, though they were enemies to the Preſbyterian diſcipline, they dared not truſt a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch whoſe profeſſions ſeemed directed by nothing but his own intereſt.</p>
               <p>When the Preſbyterians, in 1646, petitioned the houſe againſt the toleration of ſectaries, which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Scots; the Independants procured a counter petition from the city, with a great number of hands, "applauding the labours and ſucceſſes of the parliament in the cauſe of liberty, and praying them to go on with managing the affairs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, according to their wiſdoms, and not ſuffer the free-born people of England to be inſlaved on any pretence whatſoever; <hi>nor to ſuffer any ſet of people to preſcribe to them in matters of government or conſcience,</hi> and the petitioners will ſtand by them with their lives and fortunes." The Preſbyterians were hereupon preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by the wiſe parliament, who only wanted to gain time, to anſwer, in the aſſembly, their queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of preſbytery. Accordingly the aſſembly went to work for that purpoſe; but the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0010800104:186"/>Independants took the opportunity to leave them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing abſolutely to be concerned in the affair. The King, who was in the Scots army, when the treaty with the parliament was broken off, attempted to bring the Scots nation over to his intereſt by playing the Independants againſt them, but to little purpoſe, though he told them the beſt way to deſtroy the ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians was to join with the Epiſcopalians, and admit of the eſtabliſhment of both religions; "that they could not imagine there was any hopes of ſilencing the Independant party, which undoubtedly will get a toleration in religion from the parliament of England, unleſs you join with me, in that way that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the eſtabliſhing of my crown."</p>
               <p>The army, at this time, was compoſed of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, with a mixture of Anabaptiſts and other ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who, when they found the Preſbyterians, even in their treaty with the King, of 1648, inſiſting upon Preſbyterian uniformity, without making the leaſt proviſion for that liberty of conſcience they had been contending for, grew outrageous, and at length buried King, Parliament, and Preſbytery, in the ruins of the conſtitution
<note n="*" place="bottom">See p. 126 of this volume.</note>. However, they are not ſo chargeable with the death of Charles I. as their adverſaries gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagine; for though it was not poſſible for the few Independant miniſters in London to join the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians in their addreſſes againſt that meaſure
<note n="†" place="bottom">See ibid. p. 127.</note>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not poſſeſſed of parochial livings, nor members of the provinicial aſſembly of London, nor admitted to their weekly conſultations at Sion college, but were a ſort of Diſſenters from the public eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for other reaſons as concluſive, yet none of their miniſters but Hugh Peters and John Goodwin declared their approbation of the proceedings of the council of officers in the trial of the King: nay, ſome of the Independant miniſters in the country joined the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0010800104:187"/>Preſbyterians in proteſting againſt it. There were, no doubt, among them, as well as amongſt other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, men of Republican principles, who had a large ſhare in the guilt of the fatal day, that, for ſo many years, deprived the nation of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>As Oliver Cromwell was averſe to church-power, and a friend to univerſal toleration, they were one of his chief ſupports during his protectorſhip. They petitioned him for liberty to hold a ſynod, in order to publiſh to the world a uniform confeſſion of their faith; for they were become a conſiderable body, their churches were increaſed both in city and country, and many rich and ſubſtantial perſons had joined them; but they were not agreed upon any ſtandard of faith or diſcipline; tho' their brethren in New England had done it ten years before

They opened their ſynod with a day of faſting and prayer, and appointed a committee
<note n="†" place="bottom">The committee were Dr. T. Goodwin, Dr. Owen, Mr. Philip Nye, Mr. Wm. Bridge, Mr. Joſ. Caryl, and Mr. Wm.

It conſiſts of thirty-three chapters, in which are almoſt two hundred diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0010800104:188"/>articles of faith and diſcipline; though the whole time of the ſynod's ſeſſions was not above eleven or twelve days. "In moſt places this confeſſion runs in the very words of the aſſembly's confeſſion; and the difference (ſays Neale) between the two confeſſions, in points of doctrine, are ſo very ſmall, that the modern Independants have, in a manner, laid aſide the uſe of it in their families, and agreed with the Preſbyterians in the uſe of the aſſembly's catechiſm." At the end of the confeſſion there is a chapter of diſcipline, in which they aſſert, "that every particular ſociety of viſible profeſſors agreeing to walk together in the ſaith and order of the goſpel is a complete church, and has full power within itſelf to elect and ordain all church-officers, to exclude all offenders, and to do all other acts relating to the edification and well-being of the church. That the way of ordaining officers, that is, paſtors, teachers, or elders, is, after their election, by the ſuffrage of the church, to ſet them apart with faſting and prayer, and impoſition of the hands of the elderſhip of the church, tho' if there be no impoſition of hands, they are nevertheleſs rightly conſtituted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt; but they do not allow that ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the work of the miniſtry, tho' it be by perſons rightly ordained, does convey any office-power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a previous election of the church. That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may adminiſter the ſacrament but ſuch as are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed thereunto. Nor are the paſtors of one church obliged to adminiſter the ſacraments to any other, than to the members of that church to whom they ſtand related in that capacity. Nor may any perſon be added to the church, as a private mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but by the conſent of the church, after a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his faith, declared by himſelf, or otherwiſe manifeſted. They diſallow the power of all ſtated ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, preſbyteries, convocations, and aſſemblies of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, over particular churches; but admit that in caſes of difficulty, or difference relating to doctrine or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0010800104:189"/>order, churches may meet together by their meſſengers in ſynods or councils, to conſider and give advice, but without exerciſing any juriſdiction. Laſtly, They agree that churches conſiſting of perſons ſound in the faith, and of good converſation, ought not to refuſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other, tho' they walk not in all things according to the ſame rule of church order; and if they judge other churches to be true churches, tho' leſs pure, they may receive to occaſional communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch members of thoſe churches as are credibly teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to be godly, and to live without offence. Theſe opinions, they add, "may appear new to a great many people, becauſe they have not been openly and publickly profeſſed in the Engliſh nation; but we are able to trace the footſteps of an Independant congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational way in the ancienteſt practice of the church, and in the writings of the ſoundeſt proteſtant divines. That their principles do not, in the leaſt, interfere with the authority of the civil magiſtrate, nor do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves upon any occaſions with him, any further than to implore his protection, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the peace and liberty of their churches." They glory in this, that ever ſince they appeared in the world, they have diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the cauſe of Chriſtian liberty. "We have always maintained (ſay they) this principle, <hi>That among all Chriſtian ſtates and churches there ought to be a forbearance and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual indulgence to Chriſtians of all perſuaſions, that keep to, and hold faſt, the neceſſary foundations of faith.</hi> This principle we have maintained for the ſake of others, <hi>when we ourſelves had no need of it.</hi>" They conclude with thankfulneſs to their preſent governors, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe who could not comply with the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian eſtabliſhment, to enjoy the liberty of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and equal encouragement and protection with others; and that this liberty is eſtabliſhed by a law, as long as they diſturb not the public peace. "This ſhould engage us (they conclude) to promote the honour and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0010800104:190"/>proſperity of ſuch a government; to be peaceably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one towards another, and to love as brethren, foraſmuch as the differences between Preſbyterians and Independants, are differences between fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that neither of them have authority from God or man, to impoſe their opinions upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther." The reader will join with me in thinking this a moſt rational and Chriſtian concluſion, and that it does great credit to the ſynod.</p>
               <p>When General Monk cloſed with the Preſbyterians, tho' before he had inclined to the Independants, and kept an Independant chaplain about him; when every thing went in their way, and the parliament lay at their mercy, the Independants offered to ſtand by their friends in the houſe, to raiſe four new regiments from among themſelves, to force Monk back into Scotland, and to raiſe 100,000l. for the uſe of the army, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would protect them in their religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which they apprehended Monk and <hi>the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians deſigned to ſubvert;</hi> but it was too late for ſuch propoſals to be accepted; the old regiments were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged, and Monk in poſſeſſion of the city.

               <p>When the King and the hierarchy were reſtored, the Independants and Anabaptiſts petitioned for a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but during the whole reign of Charles II. they were ſubject to the ſame perſecutions and ſeverities with the reſt of the Diſſenters, and ſuffered very ſeverely on many occaſions. Upon the mad attempt of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and his followers in 1660
<note n="‖" place="bottom">See vol. iii. of this work, p. 457.</note>, which gave the court a handle to renew their ſeverities againſt the Diſſenters, the Independants thought fit publickly to diſown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that inſurrection. They in their declaration diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned the principles of a <hi>fifth monarchy,</hi> or, <hi>the perſonal reign of King Jeſus</hi> on earth, as diſhonourable to him and prejudicial to his church; and abhor the propagating this,

               <p>When James the Second publiſhed his declaration for liberty of conſcience, the Independants, at leaſt ſome of them, addreſſed the King for the indulgence therein ſhewn them, tho' they were far from approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpenſing power which produced it. With the other denominations of Diſſenters (for from this time the hiſtory of one includes all) they ſincerely join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the revolution with great zeal, and were finally bleſſed with peace and reſt from all their ſufferings by the equitable and wiſe <hi>act of toleration.</hi>

               <p>The Independants, though characteriſed and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the forementioned conſtitution of their churches, are, in theſe days, like ſome other denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Chriſtians, greatly divided in their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>The Independants, of this denomination, have a fund for the ſupport of an academy, for the training up and educating perſons for the miniſtry; tho' they do not aſſert ſuch an education is eſſentially neceſſary for that office, yet they deem it a proper expedient.

The pupils are not only recommended, but carefully examined upon their admiſſion, touching their firm belief and reſolution to be ſtedfaſt in maintaining (what they call, the orthodox ſaith; and at frequent opportunities, their ſentiments are ſcrutinized, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon any ſuſpicion of their deviating from it. Towards the expiration of the time of their continuance of the more common preparatory exerciſes, and when any are deemed properly qualified, to give public ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimens or their abilities for the miniſtry, a ſubject is pitched upon by the maſter, or principal tutor, on which they are publickly to exhibit an oration, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before ſome perſons ſelected by the committee; and if, from the ambiguity of their expreſſions, or any particular explanation of texts of ſcripture, they are ſuſpected of entertaining any heterodox opinions, it is uſual for a perſon appointed, to lay before them a ſet of articles, a creed, or ſummary of the Chriſtian faith, concerning which they are interrogated, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their belief; to which, if they anſwer in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, and ſatisfactorily, they are permitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the academy, and receive the conſequent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it, as long as may be thought neceſſary: but if it ſo happens, as is ſometimes the caſe, that, from their impartial inquiry, they indulge a more free way of thinking, and will not, cannot, <hi>bona fide,</hi> declare their belief of thoſe articles, and are found privately to call them in queſtion, let their mental qualifications, and their moral characters, be ever ſo valuable and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory to eſteem, they are diſcarded the academy, deprived of any farther benefit from the fund, leſt not only unprovided for, and treated as aliens from the faith, but ſcarcely with Chriſtian charity. This was the caſe of ſome not long ago, who are now miniſters in other ſocieties of Chriſtians, whoſe diſtinguiſhing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0010800104:193"/>abilities, and amiable lives, are an honour to their character and office.</p>
               <p>But there are other Independant ſocieties, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim any pretenſions to dictate to their miniſters, or to impoſe on them particular creeds and articles of faith, or making ſuch the boundaries of communion. They have not learned to place religion in unintelligible myſteries, nor in the Calviniſtical tenets of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, juſtification by faith, effectual calling, final perſeverance, &amp;c. They admit and encourage a much greater latitude of thinking, and ſeem to center Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in this grand article of the Chriſtian religion, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and that moral virtue is the great cement of Chriſtian ſocieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the miniſters of a reſpectable body of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination at Pinner's hall was, ſome years ago, the Rev. Dr. JAMES FOSTER, who, tho' a General Baptiſt, embraced and defended catholic communion, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accepted, at the ſame time, an invitation to preach an evening-lecture at the Old Jewry, where his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial capacity was ſo much diſcovered, and evidenced by the univerſal applauſe of the vaſt numbers who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his lectures.</p>
               <p>Nor can I forget a laudable example in another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of that ſociety, who ſucceeded Dr. Foſter, I mean the Rev. Mr. Caleb Fleming. When he was called to accept the paſtoral care of this congregation, at the time of his ordination, in oppoſition to <hi>orthodox</hi> creeds, of mere human invention, taking the Greek Teſtament in his hand, he ſaid, <hi>This I believe to be the word of God,</hi> the rule of faith and practice to Chriſtians: as ſuch, I ſhall endeavour to underſtand the true ſenſe of it, to inculcate the genuine truths and duties of it, and to live according to it. This declaration, as to the ſubſtance of it, has been the only profeſſion of faith made, alſo, by ſome of the Preſbyterian and General Baptiſt miniſters ſince, at the time of their ordination.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0010800104:194"/>However, I have thought proper to give the ſubſtance of a <q>CONFESSION <hi>of</hi> FAITH, <hi>at the public Ordination of Mr.</hi> Thomas Bradbury, London, July 10, 1707, <hi>which perhaps is moſt agreeable to the principles of the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the</hi> Independants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>FORASMUCH as, upon theſe occaſions, many have taken in hand to ſet forth, in order, a declaration of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely believed amongſt us: I deſire to make the ſame good profeſſion before many witneſſes, and according to my meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, give a reaſon of the hope that is in me, with meekneſs and fear, and eſpecially at this time, when, by faſting and prayer, and laying on of hands, I am to be ſeparated for the work whereunto the Lord hath called me; tho' I be leſs than the leaſt of all ſaints, and not worthy of this grace, to preach the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Article</hi> I. I therefore declare my belief, that the books of the Old and New Teſtament, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received amongſt us, came not by the will of man, but the holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, and are profitable for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, for reproof, for correction, and inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> II. This, thro' grace, I will always adhere to, as the great rule of my faith and miniſtry—to this law and teſtimony I profeſs to bring every opinion—this I promiſe, in a dependance upon him who has the reſidue of the ſpirit—I apply to theſe ſcriptures as the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery God hath made of himſelf in this life—I here learn what God is, and what he doth. This includes both his nature and glorious perfections: it includes both his eternal unity and a trinity of perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> III. I believe that the Lord our God is one Lord, there is none beſides him.</p>

I believe that God reſolved to glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by redeeming ſome of the loſt race:—that he did, from all eternity, predeſtinate ſome to the adoption of children, whoſe names are written in heaven:—that this election was free, and it will have a certain iſſue: —that the remnant are ſaved, according to the election of grace, not for the works which they ſhould afterwards do; but according to his own purpoſe and grace before the world began.</p>

                  <hi>Art.</hi> XII. I believe the divinity of our great Lord Redeemer; that he is over all, God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; that he thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but receives a divine homage.—I believe this word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us:—this is the myſtery of godlineſs, great without controverſy, that God was manifeſt in the fleſh.—I believe him to be a teacher come from God:—that he was made a prieſt for ever:—that he is the King of ſaints, of whoſe kingdom there ſhall be no end.—In all theſe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities he is head of the church, and the Saviour of the body—appointed to be the heir of all things; but more eſpecially lord over them who are given to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> XIII. I believe he went about doing good, delighting to do the will of him that ſent him, by the which will we are ſanctified:—that he was made a curſe for us, ſuffering in both the parts of his human nature: that he was the Meſſiah, who ſhould be cut off to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tranſgreſſion, and make an end of ſin: that there is no other name given under heaven whereby men can be ſaved.</p>

                  <hi>Art.</hi> XV. I believe that God raiſed him to heaven, looſed the pains of death, becauſe it was not poſſible he ſhould be holden of it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> XVI. I believe that whom he predeſtinated, them the alſo called, and whom he has called, them he alſo juſtifies freely by his grace. The bleſſedneſs of this conſiſts in God's imputing righteouſneſs without works.—I believe that we lay hold on this mercy by faith, and that not of ourſelves, but of the gift of God: —that the people of God receive the adoption of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0010800104:197"/>ſons, and there is a change in the diſpoſition of thoſe who are heirs of the grace of life, owing to free love and to almighty power.—I believe that the ranſomed of the Lord grow in grace, and that he who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a good work in them, will perform it unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt. No man ſhall be able to pluck them out of his hands.</p>

I believe he is to be worſhipped with reverence and godly fear.—I believe that we are to own this Lord in ſocieties, and that there is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with all that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both theirs and ours, and that Jeſus Chriſt will be with them to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> XVIII. I believe he hath given us ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and inſtitutions, which we, as Chriſtians, are obliged to perform; one of which is baptiſm in water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt—taught us all things whatſoever he has commanded—admoniſhing one another in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs.—And by eating bread and drinking wine, in remembrance of him, we are to continue ſtedfaſt in doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread and in prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> XIX. I believe, that in all theſe parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, one is our Maſter, even Chriſt; no man having dominion over our faith and liberty.</p>

                  <hi>Art.</hi> XX. I believe that the Chriſtian, at his death, enters upon two bleſſings, a complete purity and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying enjoyment, that the ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect—ſee Chriſt and know him, as themſelves are known; that more perfect felicity which will follow the reſurrection and univerſal judgment.

I believe there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt:—that Chriſt hath authority to execute judgment, becauſe he is the Son of Man: that the angels, who ſinned, are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into chains of darkneſs; both they and the wicked,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0010800104:198"/>who know not God, nor obey the goſpel of his dear Son, ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment; but the righteous into life eternal.</p>

               <p>Some Hiſtorians, indeed, deduce their origin, as a ſect, from much later times, and affirm they firſt ſprang up in Germany, and ſeparated themſelves from the Lutherans, becauſe the doctrine of theſe reformers was imperfect, or not brought to the primitive ſtandard; as the proper mode and ſubject of baptiſm was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by them to be neceſſary in the performance of the rite

However, according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in this land, and the degree to which perſecution has at any time ariſen, they have always had their full ſhare of it.</p>
               <p>It is pretty clear, from the conſent of many learned authors, that Wickliffe, the firſt Engliſh reformer, denied infant-baptiſm to be lawful; for one of his tenets was, "That thoſe are fools and preſumptuous, which affirm ſuch infants not to be ſaved, which die without baptiſm; and he denied, that all ſins are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in baptiſm
<note n="§" place="bottom">Fuller, p. 133.</note>." As it was the opinion that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm waſhed away original ſin, and by a ſecret virtue regenerated the perſon, and that the infant dying without it, was in danger of damnation, that opinion began, and eſtabliſhed the practice of infant-baptiſm; therefore, this foundation being removed, that practice

                  </note>, and which I look upon to be proper for my purpoſe. "At this time, 1547, there were many Anabaptiſts in ſeveral parts of England; they were generally Germans, whom the revolutions there had forced to change their ſeats. Upon Luther's firſt preaching in Germany, there aroſe many, who, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome of his principles, carried things much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he did. The chief foundation he laid down was, that the ſcripture was to be the only rule of Chriſtians. Upon this many argued, that the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Trinity, and Chriſt's incarnation and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, of the fall of man, and the aids of grace, were indeed philoſophical ſubtilities, and only pretended to be deduced from ſcripture, as almoſt all opinions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were, and therefore they rejected them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe the baptiſm of infants was one. They held that to be no baptiſm, and ſo were rebaptiſed. But from this, which was moſt taken notice of, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a viſible thing, they carried all the general name of Anabaptiſts. On the 12th of April there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint brought to the council, that with the ſtrangers that were come into England, ſome of that perſuaſion had come over, and were diſſeminating their errors, and making proſelytes: ſo a commiſſion was ordered
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0010800104:203"/>for the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the Biſhops of Ely, Worceſter, Weſtminſter, Chicheſter, Lincoln, and Rocheſter, Sir William Petre, Sir Thomas Smith, Dr. Cox, Dr. May, and ſome others, three of them being a <hi>quorum,</hi> to examine and ſearch after all Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, heretics, or contemners of the Common-prayer. They were to endeavour to reclaim them, to enjoin them penance, and give them abſolution, or, if they were obſtinate, to excommunicate and impriſon them, and to deliver them over to the ſecular power, to be further proceeded againſt. Some tradeſmen in London were brought before theſe commiſſioners in May, and were perſuaded to abjure their former opinions, one of which was, that the baptiſm of infants was not profitable. One of thoſe, who thus abjured, was commanded to carry a faggot, next Sunday, at St. Paul's, where there ſhould be a ſermon, ſetting forth his hereſy. But there was another of theſe extreme obſtinate, Joan Bocher, commonly called Joan of Kent. She denied that Chriſt was truly incarnate of the Virgin, whoſe fleſh being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he could take none of it; but the word, by the conſent of the inward man in the Virgin, took fleſh of her; theſe were her words. They took much pains about her, and had many conferences with her; but ſhe was ſo extravagantly conceited of her own notions, that ſhe rejected all they ſaid with ſcorn. Whereupon ſhe was adjudged an obſtinate heretic, and ſo left to the ſecular power
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. iii. of this work, p. 100.</note>." In 1550, the Anabaptiſts were excepted out of a general pardon. Theſe Anabaptiſts were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of an untractable and obſtinate temper; "but (ſays Burnet) for the other ſort of the Anabaptiſts, who only denied infant-baptiſm
<note n="†" place="bottom">See ibid. p. 129.</note>, I find no ſeverities uſed to them, but ſeveral books were written againſt them, to which they wrote ſome anſwers. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the Baptiſts greatly increaſed, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0010800104:204"/>were ſubjected to impriſonment and baniſhment
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. ii. of this work, p. 157.</note>. Some few indeed recanted their errors, as Fuller obſerves; but two were burnt in Smithfield. In the reign of James I. among the perſecuted exiles that fled to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were ſeveral Anabaptiſts, who ſet up a church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſtorſhip of Mr. John Smith, who had been a miniſter of the eſtabliſhed church; but they were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently oppoſed by the other Puritan exiles, from whom they received much abuſe in books written againſt their opinions. In this reign Edward Wightman, a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, of Burton upon Trent, was burnt at Litchfield. He was the laſt martyr that ſuffered by this cruel kind of death in England; and it may be remarked, that William Sawtre, the firſt that ſuffered in that manner, for his religious opinions, was ſuppoſed to have denied infant-baptiſm: ſo that this ſect

In 1620, ſeveral Anabaptiſts tranſported themſelves into New England, where for a time they met with but hard meaſure from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational brethren, who, tho' they had fled from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution themſelves, yet could give no great latitude to the tender conſciences of the Baptiſts and Quakers. Dr. Mather, in his eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, has indeed acknowledged many of the Baptiſts to be worthy and honeſt men; and that Mr. Williams, one of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, being baniſhed from Salem, ſettled at a place called Providence, where he gathered a church together, and was very inſtrumental in obtaining a charter for the government of Rhode Iſland, of which he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times choſen governor, and that he did all in his power to convert the Indians in his neighbourhood; of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0010800104:205"/>language and tempers of whom, he publiſhed a relation. When they were reſtored to a peaceable ſtate, the Baptiſts ſpread greatly in the colonies of New England, increaſed much in Penſilvania, where they had, in 1714, nine churches, and there are now Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt churches in many other colonies in the Britiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. But to return home:</p>
               <p>In 1616, the more moderate Baptiſts publiſhed a ſmall treatiſe, wherein they endeavoured to juſtify their ſeparation from the church of England, and to prove that every man has a right to judge for himſelf in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion; and that to perſecute any on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is illegal and antichriſtian, contrary to the laws of God, as well as to ſeveral declarations of the King's Majeſty. They alſo aſſert their opinion concerning baptiſm, and ſhew the invalidity of the baptiſm which was adminiſtered, either in the eſtabliſhed church, or among the other Diſſenters; and clear themſelves of ſeveral errors unjuſtly caſt upon them. It appears to be written, or approved of, by the whole body of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts who then remained in England. They ſubſcribe themſelves Chriſt's unworthy miniſters, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's faithful ſubjects, commonly called Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, from this treatiſe, inform my readers what were, in general, the opinions of this denomination at this period. They acknowledge magiſtracy to be God's ordinance; and that Kings, and ſuch as are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ought to be obeyed in all civil matters, <hi>not only for fear, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> They allow the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an oath to be lawful; and declare that all their profeſſion were willing, in faithfulneſs and truth, to ſubſcribe the oath of allegiance. They proteſt againſt the doctrine of the Papiſts, that princes excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Pope may be depoſed or murdered by their ſubjects: calling it a damnable and accurſed doctrine, which their ſouls abhor; and alſo againſt the errors of the Familiſts, who, to avoid perſecution, can comply with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0010800104:206"/>any external form of religion. They confeſs that Chriſt took his fleſh of the virgin Mary; and, for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy in theſe and other points, refer the reader to their confeſſion of faith, publiſhed in 1611. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that many called Anabaptiſts held ſeveral ſtrange opinions contrary to them; but lament it, and clear themſelves from deſerving any cenſure upon that account, by ſhewing that it was ſo in the primitive church, and yet Chriſt did not condemn all for the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of ſome. But that which they chiefly inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is the pride, luxury, and oppreſſion of the Lords Biſhops, or pretended ſpiritual power, whereby they were expoſed to great hardſhips and cruel perſecutions. Having in their preface mentioned that text, <hi>The Kings of the earth ſhall give their power unto the beaſt;</hi> "If it be granted (ſay they) that the Kings of this nation formerly have given their power to the Romiſh beaſt, it ſhall evidently appear that our Lord the King, and all magiſtrates under him, do give their power unto the ſame beaſt, tho' the beaſt be in another ſhape."—"Our moſt humble deſire of our Lord the King is, that he would not give his power to force his faithful-ſubjects to diſſemble, to believe as he believes, in the leaſt meaſure of perſecution; tho' it is no ſmall perſecution to lie many years in filthy priſons, in hunger, cold, idleneſs, divided from wiſe, family, calling, left in continual miſeries and temptations, ſo as death would be to many leſs perſecution." Again, ſhewing how near the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical power and uſurpation came to the bloody ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power of the Roman Catholics, they ſay, "How many, only for ſeeking reformation, have been put to death by your power, in the days of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth? and how many, both then and ſince, have been conſumed to death, in priſons? Yea, ſince that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power hath been ſet up, hath not hanging, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exile, impriſonments, and all manner of contempts, been uſed, and all for religion, altho' ſome, for grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous errors, and yet you ſee not this to be a bloody
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0010800104:207"/>rellgion!" — "Let (they ſay in another place) Mr. Fox, or any others who have deſcribed the ſpiritual power of Rome, let but their deſcription thereof be compared with the ſpiritual power, in all their laws, courts, titles, pomp, pride, and cruelty, and you ſhall ſee them very little differ, except in their <hi>cruelties,</hi> which, glory be to God, the King's Majeſty, who thirſteth not after blood, hath ſomewhat reſtrained. Altho' it is moſt grievous cruelty to lie divers years in moſt noiſome and filthy priſons, and continual tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of want, their eſtates overthrown, and never co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out, many of them, till death; let it be well weighed, and it is little inferior to the cruel ſudden death in times of the Romiſh power in this nation." After all, they conclude with an hearty prayer for their enemies, "That the Lord would give them repentance; that their ſins may not be laid to their charge, even for Chriſt's ſake."</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this declaration, their ſufferings were rather increaſed than leſſened. They were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harraſſed in the ſpiritual courts, but the temporal ſword was uſed againſt them; their goods ſeized, their perſons confined, for many years, in ſtinking goals, where they were deprived of their wives, children and friends, till God was pleaſed to releaſe numbers of them by death.</p>
               <p>Many other attempts they made in the reign of James, to obtain a toleration, but without effect; yet they daily gained ground. In that of Charles the Firſt, they ſuffered with the reſt of the Puritans ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſecutions; and in the year 1633, the Baptiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſeparate themſelves from the Puritans, and to form ſocieties diſtinct and apart of thoſe of their own perſuaſion. In 1642, was a diſpute between the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. Featley and four Anabaptiſts, in Southwark; an account of which the Doctor publiſhed, tho' a very doubtful and partial one; in the dedication to which he ſays, that "he could hardly dip his pen in any thing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0010800104:208"/>but gall;" a ſure proof of his unrighteous ſpirit. It was publiſhed with the following title, "The dippers dipped, or the Anabaptiſts dipped and plunged over head and ears, in a diſputation lately held in Southwark, &amp;c. &amp;c."</p>
               <p>What greatly contributed to the increaſe of Antipoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſm in theſe times was, that ſome of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt writers for reformation ſpoke favourably of that opinion, and the reaſonableneſs of granting liberty to thoſe who held it; ſuch were Robert Lord Brooke, Mr. Daniel Rogers, Biſhop Taylor, and Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond. In 1043, the Baptiſts publiſhed their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faith, of which ſeveral editions were printed in 1644 and 1646, one of which was licenſed by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and dedicated to the parliament. Their very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries were obliged to own this confeſſion was, in general, orthodox, and could object very little againſt it, except the denial of infant-baptiſm, and making immerſion neceſſary to the right adminiſtration of that ordinance. However, they were now perſecuted by the intolerant Preſbyterians, as they had before been by the rigid Epiſcopalians: but, in March 1647, a declaration of the Lords and Commons was publiſhed in their favour, induced thereto by the great numbers of them then in the army, and in moſt corporations of England. It had the following words:</p>
               <p>"The name of Anabaptiſm hath, indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted much odium, by reaſon of the extravagant principles and practices of ſome of that name in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, tending to the diſturbance of the government and peace of all ſtates; which opinions and practices we abhor and deteſt: but for their opinion againſt the baptiſm of infants, it is only a difference about a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time in the adminiſtration of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein, in former ages, as well as this, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men have differed both in opinion and practice. And though we could wiſh that all men would ſatisfy themſelves, and join with us in our judgment and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0010800104:209"/>in this point; yet herein we hold it fit that men ſhould be convinced by the word of God, with great gentleneſs and reaſon, and not beaten out of it with force and violence, &amp;c." It ſhould ſeem, however, this Chriſtian temper in the parliament was but of ſhort duration; for, in 1648, they publiſhed a cruel ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <hi>for the puniſhing of blaſphemies and hereſies,</hi> by which every ſect but the rigid Preſbyterians were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and upon this ordinance ſeveral Baptiſts were proſecuted for denying the validity of infant-baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The ſhort reſt they enjoyed towards the cloſe of the uſurped government had a period by the reſtoration of King Charles II. in which they concurred with ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from whom (or rather his miniſters and clergy) they ſoon experienced equal hardſhips with other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and were perſecuted in all parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with impriſonment, loſs of goods, &amp;c. &amp;c. Upon Venner's inſurrection, they publiſhed two apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, wherein they proteſted againſt the principles and practices of him and his adherents; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there were no Baptiſts amongſt them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the perſecution of them was not ceaſed, and, if poſſible, they ſtill met with harder meaſure than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore, ſo that, in about eighteen weeks only, many, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of that inſurrection, were kept cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. Above four hundred were crowded into New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, beſides what were in other priſons; but at the coronation an act of indemnity being granted to all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, ſave murderers, they were all ſet at liberty. Yet in vain were all their petitions and remonſtrances, in vain the many ſenſible vindications they publiſhed of their principles and practices: they were every where, in this reign, loaded with fines, hardſhips, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and abuſe. About the year 1676, the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts had ſeveral diſputes with the Quakers, which ended to their advantage. In 1677, they publiſhed "A confeſſion of their faith, put forth by the elders and brethren of many congregations of Chriſtians bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0010800104:210"/>upon profeſſion of their faith, in London and the country."</p>
               <p>To ſurvey the ſufferings of the pious and worthy perſons who encountered all perils for the ſake of a good conſcience, amongſt the Baptiſts, though it would draw tears from the ſympathetic eye, yet muſt, at the ſame time, inſpire the reader with the ſame holy confidence and reſolution they in general exerted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their perſecutions and bonds; and I muſt think their fortitude proceeded from the ſecret influence of a ſuperior and unſeen power, which ſtrengthened them in the day of trial.</p>
               <p>The Baptiſts ſuffered ſeverely in the reign of James II. till his declaration for liberty of conſcience relieved them and their perſecuted brethren of the other deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Diſſenters. At length the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, and the conſequent toleration of Proteſtant Diſſenters, reſtored them to the public profeſſion of their principles. "The face of things being thus changed, it preſently appeared how ineffectual thoſe cruel and barbarous methods, fines, impriſonments, &amp;c. were to ſtop the growth and increaſe of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Baptiſts: for, ſoon after, it appeared by the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the proceedings of a general aſſembly, there were more than one hundred congregations of them aſſembled together, to conſult of proper ways and means to advance the glory of God, and the well being of their churches. A general faſt was ordered by this aſſembly to be kept by all the congregations, and the cauſes and reaſons thereof ſent to all the churches." "At this general aſſembly, which was every day o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and concluded with ſolemn prayer, were preſent upwards of one hundred and fifty perſons; and ſo united were their hearts in the ſpirit of love and ſweet concord, that, in their debates, conſultations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, they ſay, <hi>ſcarcely one brother diſſented from the aſſembly in the ſentiments of his mind, in any one thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to their ſerious conſideration.</hi> This general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0010800104:211"/>Sept. 5. conſidered and concluded that a public fund or ſtock was neceſſary towards maintaining and ſupporting a regular miniſtry, and came to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how to raiſe it; and unanimouſly concluded that it ſhould be raiſed by a <hi>free-will offering;</hi> that every perſon ſhould communicate according to his ability, and as the Lord ſhall make him willing, and enlarge his heart; and that the churches ſeverally among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do order the collection of it with all convenient ſpeed, that the ends propoſed may be put into preſent practice.</p>
               <p>The uſes to which this fund was to be applied were, 1. To communicate thereof to thoſe churches that are not able to maintain their own miniſtry; and that their miniſters may be encouraged wholly to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the great work of preaching the goſpel. 2. To ſend miniſters that are ordained, or at leaſt ſolemnly called, to preach both in city and country, where the goſpel hath or hath not been preached, and to viſit the churches; and theſe to be choſen out of the churches in London, or the country; which miniſters are to be approved of, and ſent forth by two churches at the leaſt; but more, if it may be. 3. To aſſiſt thoſe members that ſhall be found in any of the aforeſaid churches that are diſpoſed for ſtudy, have an inviting gift, and are ſound in fundamentals, in attaining to the knowledge and underſtanding of the languages, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew."</p>
               <p>The Baptiſts hiſtory from this happy aera of the act of toleration is not ſuch as to come within the compaſs of my propoſed plan. I have brought them to the ſafe enjoyment of their religious liberties: ſince that was afforded to them, by the wiſdom of the legiſlature, their hiſtory, to the preſent day, can conſiſt of little but acts of internal diſcipline, the meetings and acts of their aſſemblies, and a few controverſies which have agitated them relating to the doctrine of the Trinity, pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinging, &amp;c. &amp;c. They have dutifully, with the other
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0010800104:212"/>denominations, addreſſed the throne upon all intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public occaſions, and have been concerned with them in the ſeveral applications for the repeal of the corporation and teſt acts.</p>
               <p>As the Baptiſts are divided into two bodies, called <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular,</hi> before I lay before my readers their ſentiments in point of doctrine, I ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their method of performing the rite of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in which they are all agreed, with very little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation; particularly as it is that peculiar practice by which they are diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>It will be proper to premiſe, that the perſon to be baptiſed is previouſly inſtructed in the principles of the Chriſtian religion, of the nature of baptiſm, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, pre-requiſite qualifications, the manner in which it ought to be adminiſtered, and the advantages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from it; that from a perſuaſion of its being then his duty, he may voluntarily offer and deſire to be baptiſed. The miniſter then, with ſome of that ſociety, converſe with him or her; after which, at the time and place appointed, which is uſually the next Sabbath-day, ſometimes after the morning-ſervice, at other times after the afternoon-ſervice, and at other times on ſome other day of the week, the rite is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when there is uſually a ſermon ſuitable to that occaſion; and the miniſter uſes a ſhort addreſs to the perſon to be baptiſed, to the following purpoſe.</p>
               <q>In preſenting yourſelf before God, and theſe witneſſes and members of his church, to be baptiſed, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and into the profeſſion of the Chriſtian religion, we preſume, in charity, and have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe you are determined by the clear and ſtrong ſenſe of your duty, and with ſuch diſpoſitions as your own conſcience approves, ſuch as are acceptable to God, and, thro' his bleſſing upon your faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, will terminate in the improvement and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of your ſoul, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0010800104:213"/>Then the miniſter enlarges on the grounds and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt's inſtituting the ordinance of baptiſm: unleſs a ſermon is preached on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>The miniſter proceeds to explain what is properly to be underſtood by being baptiſed into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt —He likewiſe enlarges on the moral uſe and influence of baptiſm,—on the qualifications demanded in ſcripture, of all perſons to whom Chriſtian baptiſm is to be adminiſtered, as that which can juſtify a miniſter therein, and in vindication of this mode of baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Then the miniſter, addreſſing himſelf to the perſon, aſks him theſe queſtions:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Will you declare in the church and preſence of God, who cannot be deceived, and will not be mocked, that you believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſ.</hi> Is it your affectionate reverence for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, that induces you at this time to offer yourſelf to be baptiſed into the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his holy name and religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſ.</hi> Are you reſolved to renounce every known and preſumptuous ſin, to obey the precepts, and follow the example of your Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and in an humble dependance upon God, to adorn the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity you this day put on, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the end of your life a converſation becoming the goſpel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, in ſome congregations, they ſing a pſalm or hymn adapted to the occaſion, and then pray; at others they proceed to prayer without ſinging; the matter and form of which, as recommended in Harriſon's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Baptiſm, printed in 1759, and given as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0010800104:214"/>appears to be well adapted; but I muſt refer the curious to the book itſelf.</p>
               <p>The miniſter then withdraws to dreſs himſelf for the adminiſtration, as do the perſons to be baptiſed; for they have proper dreſſes for men and women, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apartments, with proper attendants on each. In the time of intermiſſion another miniſter or deacon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reads <hi>Pſ.</hi> xxvi. cxviii. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> iii. <hi>Acts</hi> viii. <hi>Romans</hi> vi. or ſome other parts of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Upon the miniſter's, &amp;c. return to the baptiſtry (which at Barbican
<note n="*" place="bottom">Near Adlerſage ſtreet.</note> is admirably commodious), the miniſter addreſſing himſelf to the perſon to be baptiſed, ſays, "In conſequence of your voluntary, public, and ſolemn profeſſion of your Chriſtian faith, penitence, and holy reſolutions, it becomes my duty to baptiſe you:" then, taking the perſon by the hand, they go down together into the water, uſing theſe or ſuch like phraſes: <hi>They went down into the water, Philip with the eunuch, and he baptiſed him.—Who ſhall forbid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that theſe ſhould not be baptiſed, who have made a good profeſſion before many witneſſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes, where the former addreſs to the perſon has been omitted, the miniſter ſays, immediately before the baptiſm, "As thou haſt profeſſed thy faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and deſireſt to be baptiſed, I baptiſe thee in his name." At other times only the ſcripture form is uſed, <hi>I baptiſe thee, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> At coming up out of the water, ſome ſignificant phraſe is uſually made uſe of, as—<hi>We are buried with him by baptiſm.—Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then the miniſter and the baptiſed retire, and ſome other miniſter generally concludes with ſinging a pſalm or hymn, and then prayer. The perſon thus baptiſed is deemed a member of the ſociety, and conſequently has a right to partake of the Lord's ſupper, in that church, or any other of the ſame denomination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0010800104:215"/>But here, in many congregations, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, they practiſe laying on of hands of the miniſter on the party baptiſed, with prayer, before their admiſſion to communion. This is ſometimes conſidered as a primitive practice, which was always at leaſt generally performed ſoon after baptiſm, and mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. &amp;c.—Others aſſert, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands by the Apoſtles and firſt miniſters of the Chriſtian church was generally attended with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effects, as evidences of their miſſion. But as no mention is made of this in the hiſtory of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's life, and theſe effects ceaſed with the Apoſtles, it is thought by many, who ſubmit to baptiſm, of no ſtanding obligation in the Chriſtian church, and is conſequently diſpenſed with by miniſters of ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, where there is not a perſuaſion of its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and expedience.</p>
               <p>The two parties of Baptiſts in England, which have ſubſiſted ever ſince their firſt appearance as a ſect, are, the <hi>particular Baptiſts,</hi> viz. thoſe that have followed the doctrines of Calvin, and from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal point thereof, <hi>perſonal election,</hi> are ſo called
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. ii. of this work, p. 121.</note>; the <hi>general Baptiſts,</hi> who profeſs the Arminian or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant tenets, and have, from the chief of thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, <hi>univerſal redemption</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See Id. p. 166.</note>, been ſo denominated. Theſe laſt have alſo their general aſſembly annually held at London, in the Whitſun-week.</p>
               <p>The chief heads of belief and doctrine of the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Baptiſts</hi> I muſt draw from the various confeſſions of their faith which have appeared in the world, from time to time, which vary little from each other, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting afterwards in what ſome of the preſent particular Baptiſts differ.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0010800104:217"/>that Chriſt ſhould be made a ſacrifice for ſin, &amp;c. all of mere free and abſolute grace towards God's elect, and without any condition foreſeen in them to procure it: that the office of Mediator, that is, to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King of the church of God, cannot be transferred from Chriſt to any other: that he might be a prophet every way complete, it was neceſſary he ſhould be God, and alſo that he ſhould be man; for unleſs he had been God, he never could perfectly have underſtood the will of God; and unleſs he had been man, he could not ſuitably have unfolded it in his own perſon to men: that, by the ſacrifice of Chriſt for ſin, he hath finally finiſhed and ſuffered all things required for the ſalvation of God's elect, &amp;c. that Jeſus Chriſt, by his death, did purchaſe ſalvation to the elect that God gave unto him: that theſe only have intereſt in him, and fellowſhip with him, for whom he makes interceſſion with his father in their behalf, and to them alone doth God, by his ſpirit, apply this redemption; as alſo the free gift of eternal life is given to them, and none elſe: that faith is the gift of God, wrought in the hearts of the elect by the Spirit of God: that all thoſe who have that precious faith wrought in them by the Spirit can never finally nor totally fall away; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gifts of God are without repentance, and the names of the elect have been written in the book of life from all eternity: that faith is ordinarily begotten by the preaching of the goſpel or word of Chriſt, without any power or agency in the creature; but it being wholly paſſive, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, doth believe and is converted by no leſs power than that which raiſed Chriſt from the dead: that all believers are by Chriſt united to God; that they are the ſons of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt, to whom belong all the promiſes of this life, and that which is to come: that they are juſtified from all their ſins by the blood of Chriſt: that ſanctification is a ſpiritual grace: that all believers, in the time of this life, are

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0010800104:220"/>faith, under Chriſt their head: that all due ſubjection be yielded to the civil magiſtrate, and ſupplication and prayers be made for Kings, and all that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that under them we may live a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, in all godlineſs and honeſty: that we are to witneſs to the truth of the ſcriptures unto death, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in the midſt of all trials and afflictions, as his ſaints of old have done; not accounting our goods, lands, wives, children, &amp;c. &amp;c. yea and our own lives, dear unto us, ſo we may finiſh our courſe with joy; remembering always, that we ought to obey God, rather than men, who will, when we have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our courſe, and kept the faith, give us a crown of righteouſneſs; to whom we muſt give an account of all our actions, and no man being able to diſcharge us thereof: that it is lawful for a Chriſtian to be a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or civil officer, to take an oath for confirmation of truth: that there ſhall be a reſurrection of the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt, and every one ſhall give an account of himſelf to God, that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things done in his body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad.</p>

               <p n="1">I. WE believe, and are very confident, that there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, from everlaſting to everlaſting, glorious and unwordable in all his attributes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> xl. 28.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That God in the beginning made man <hi>upright,</hi> and put him into a ſtate and condition of glory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt mixture of miſery; from which he, by <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> fell, and ſo came into a miſerable and mortal eſtate, ſubject unto the firſt death. <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 31. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> vii. 29. <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17. and iii. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That there is one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, who is the only begotten Son of God, born of the Virgin Mary; yet as truly David's lord, and David's root, as David's ſon and David's off-ſpring; whom God freely <hi>ſent into the world,</hi> becauſe of his great love unto the world; who as freely <hi>gave himſelf a ranſom for all; taſting death for every man; a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Luke xx. 24. Rev. xxii. 16. 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6. 1 John ii. 2. Heb. ii. 9.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>That God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. iii. 9. <hi>and the

For which end Chriſt hath commanded that the goſpel (to wit, the glad tidings of remiſſion of ſins) ſhould be preached to every creature, <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 15. So that no man ſhall eternally ſuffer in hell (that is, the ſecond death) for want of a Chriſt that died for them; but, as the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>for denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 1. or becauſe they <hi>believe not in the name of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> John iii. 18. Unbelief therefore being the cauſe why the juſt and righteous God will condemn the children of men; it follows, againſt all contradiction, that all men, at one time or other, are put into ſuch capacity, as that (thro' the grace of God) they may be eternally ſaved. <hi>John</hi> i. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 30. <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 10, 18, 19. 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 10. <hi>John</hi> iii. 17.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That ſuch who firſt orderly come into, and are brought up in the ſchool of Chriſt's church, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, come to degrees of Chriſtianity, rightly qualified, and conſiderably gifted by God's Spirit, ought to exerciſe their gifts, not only in the church, but alſo (as occaſion ſerves) to preach to the world (they being approved of by the church ſo to do) <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 22, 23, 24. ch. xi. 19, 20. and that among ſuch ſome are to be choſen by the church, and ordained by faſting, prayer, and laying on of hands, for the work of the miniſtry. <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 2, 3. and i. 23. Such ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained (and abiding faithful in their works) we own as miniſters of the goſpel; but all ſuch who come not firſt to repent of their ſins, believe on the Lord Jeſus, and ſo are <hi>baptiſed</hi> in his name for the remiſſion of ſins, but are only brought up in the ſchools of human learning, to the attaining human arts, and variety of languages, with many vain curioſities of ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 19, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 1, 4, 5, ſeeking rather the gain of large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, than the gain of ſouls to God: Such (we ſay) we utterly deny, being ſuch as have need rather to be

               <p n="6">VI. That the way ſet forth by God for men to be juſt fied in, is by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1. That is to ſay, when men ſhall aſſent to the truth of the goſpel, believing, with all their hearts, that there is remiſſion of ſins, and eternal life to be had in Chriſt. And that Chriſt therefore is moſt worthy their conſtant affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubjection to all his commandments; and therefore reſolve, with purpoſe of heart, ſo to ſubject unto him in all things, and no longer unto themſelves. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 15. And ſo ſhall (with all godly ſorrow for the ſins paſt) commit themſelves to his grace, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently depending upon him, for that which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is to be had in him: Such ſo believing are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from all their ſins, their faith ſhall be accounted unto them for righteouſneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 22, 23, 24. and iii. 25, 26.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That there is one only holy Spirit, the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gift of God, ſreely given to ſuch as <hi>obey him,</hi> Eph. iv. 4. Acts v. 32. that thereby they may be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctified, and made able (without which they are altogether unable) to abide ſtedfaſt in the faith, and to honour the Father, and his Son Chriſt, the author and finiſher of their faith. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 11. There are three that bear record in heaven; the Father, the Word, the Holy Spirit, and theſe three are one, 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 7. which ſpirit of promiſe ſuch have not yet received (though they ſpeak much of him) that are ſo far out of <hi>love, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs, and temperance (the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. v. 22, 23.) as that they breathe out much cruelty, and great envy againſt the liberties, and peaceable living of ſuch as are not of their judgment, though holy as to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That God hath, even before <hi>the foundation of the world, choſen</hi> (or elected) <hi>to eternal life, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> and ſo are in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> iii. 16. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 4.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0010800104:224"/>2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 13. yet confident we are, that the purpoſe of God, according to election, was not in the leaſt ariſing from foreſeen faith in, or works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs done by the creature, but only from the mercy, goodneſs, and compaſſion dwelling in God, and ſo <hi>it is of him that calleth,</hi> Rom. ix. 11. whoſe purity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wordable holineſs cannot admit of any unclean perſon (or thing) to be in his preſence; therefore his decree of mercy reaches only the godly man, whom (ſaith David) God <hi>hath ſet apart for himſelf,</hi> Pſal. iv. 3.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That men not conſidered ſimply as men, but ungodly men, <hi>were of old ordained to condemnation,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſuch, who turn the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. God indeed ſends a ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion to men, that they might be damned, but we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that they are ſuch (as ſaith the Apoſtle) that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved,</hi> 2 Theſſ. ii. 10, 11, 12, and ſo the indignation and wrath of God, is upon <hi>every ſoul</hi> of man, that doth <hi>evil,</hi> living and dying therein, <hi>for there is no reſpect of perſons with God,</hi> Rom. ii. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That all children dying in infancy, having not actually tranſgreſſed againſt the law of God in their own perſons, are only ſubject to the firſt death, which comes upon them by the ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> from whence they ſhall be all raiſed by the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and not that any one of them (dying in that eſtate) ſhall ſuffer for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, eternal puniſhment in hell (which is the ſecond death) <hi>for to ſuch belongs the kingdom of heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 22.

And as for all ſuch who preach not this doctrine, but inſtead thereof, that ſcriptureleſs thing of ſprinkling of infants <hi>(falſely called baptiſm)</hi> whereby the <hi>pure word of God is made of no effect,</hi> and the New Teſtament way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in members into the church by regeneration, caſt out; when as the bond woman and her ſon, that is to ſay, the Old Teſtament way of bringing in children into the church by generation is caſt out, as ſaith the ſcripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 22, 23, 24, 30. <hi>Matt.</hi> iii. 8, 9. All ſuch we utterly deny; foraſmuch as we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather to reprove them,</hi> Eph. v. 11.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. That it is the duty of all ſuch who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers baptiſed, to draw nigh unto God in ſubmiſſion to that principle of Chriſt's doctrine, to wit, prayer, and laying on of hands, that they may receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 12, 15, 17. ch. xix. 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 6. Whereby they may <hi>mortify the deeds of the body,</hi> Rom. viii. 13. and live in all things anſwerable to their profeſſed intentions and deſires, even to the honour of him, <hi>who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. That it is the duty of ſuch, who are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as aforeſaid, to continue ſtedfaſtly in Chriſt's and the Apoſtle's doctrine, and aſſembling together, in fellowſhip, in breaking of bread and prayers, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 42.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. That although we thus declare for the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way and order of conſtituting churches; yet we

               <p n="15">XV.

               <p n="18">XVIII. That ſuch who are true believers, even branches in Chriſt the Vine (and that in his account, whom he exhorts to abide in him, <hi>John</hi> xv. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) or ſuch who have charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith unfeigned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 5. may nevertheleſs, for want of watchfulneſs, ſwerve and turn aſide from the ſame, ver. 6, 7. and became as withered branches, caſt into the fire and burned, <hi>John</hi> xv. 6 But ſuch <hi>who add unto their faith virtue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to virtue knowledge, and unto knowledge temperance,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 5, 6, 7. ſuch <hi>ſhall never fall,</hi> ver. 8, 9, 10. it is impoſſible for all the falſe chriſts and falſe prophets that are, and are to come, to deceive ſuch; for they are <hi>kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 5.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. That the poor ſaints belonging to the church of Chriſt, are to be ſufficiently provided for by the churches, that they neither want food or raiment; and this by a free and voluntary contribution, and not of neceſſity, or by the conſtraint or power of the magiſtrate, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 11, 12. and this through the free and voluntary help of the deacons (called overſeers of the poor) being faithful men; choſen by the church, and ordained by prayer and laying on of hands to that work, <hi>Acts</hi> vi. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

               </p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. That the holy ſcripture is the rule whereby ſaints, both in matters of faith and converſation, are to be regulated; they being <hi>able to make men wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith in Chriſt Jeſus; profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 15, 16, 17. John xx. 31. Iſa. viii. 20.</p>

That it is the will and mind of God (in theſe goſpel times) that all men ſhould have the free liberty of their own <hi>conſciences</hi> in matters of religion or worſhip, without the leaſt oppreſſion or perſecution, as ſimply upon that account; and that for any in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity otherwiſe to act, we confidently believe is expreſsly contrary to the mind of Chriſt; who requires, that <hi>whatſoever men would that others ſhould do unto them, they ſhould even ſo do unto others,</hi> Matt. vii. 12. and that the tares and the wheat ſhould grow together in the field (which is the world) until the harveſt (which is the end of the world) <hi>Matt.</hi> xiii. 29, 30, 38, 39.</p>
               <p n="25">
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0010800104:230"/>XXV. We believe, That there ought to be civil magiſtrates in all nations, <hi>for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 14. and that all wicked lewdneſs and fleſhly filthineſs, contrary to juſt and wholſome (civil) laws, ought to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the nature of the offences; and this without reſpect of any perſons, religion, or profeſſion whatſoever; and that we, and all men are obliged by goſpel rules, <hi>to be ſubject to the higher powers, to obey magiſtrates,</hi> Tit. iii. 1. <hi>and to ſubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 13. But in caſe the civil power do, or ſhall at any time impoſe things about matters of religion, which we, through conſcience to God, cannot actually obey; then we, with Peter alſo, do ſay, That we ought in ſuch caſes <hi>to obey God rather than men,</hi> Acts v. 29. and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do hereby declare our whole and holy intent and purpoſe, That through the help of grace we will not yield, nor in ſuch caſe in the leaſt actually obey them; yet humbly purpoſing, in the Lord's ſtrength, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer whatſoever ſhall be inflicted upon us for our conſcionable forbearance.</p>
               <p>Theſe things, O ye ſons and daughters of men, we verily believe to be the Lord's will and mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but ſpeak! And if herein we differ from many, yea, from multitudes, from the learned, the wiſe and prudent of this world, we, with Peter and John, do herein make our ſolemn and ſerious appeal; namely, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto men</hi> (of a contrary perſuaſion) <hi>more than unto God.</hi> O let the judicious judge righteous judgment, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 19, 20. And in the belief and practice of theſe things, it being the good old apoſtolical way, our ſouls have found that reſt and ſoul-peace which the world knows not, and which they cannot take from us. Of whom then ſhall we be afraid? <hi>God is become our ſtrength, our light, our ſalvation;</hi> therefore are we reſolved, through
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0010800104:231"/>grace, to ſeal the truth of theſe things, in a way of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering perſecution; not only to the loſs of our goods, freedoms, or liberties, but with our lives alſo, if called thereunto.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we do utterly, and from our very hearts, in the Lord's fear, declare againſt all thoſe wicked and deviliſh reports and reproaches, falſely caſt upon us, as though ſome of us (in and about the city of London) had lately <hi>gotten knives, hooked knives,</hi> and the like, and great ſtore of arms beſides what was given forth by order of parliament, intending to cut the throats of ſuch as were contrary-minded to us in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and that many ſuch <hi>knives</hi> and arms, for the carrying on ſome ſecret deſign, hath been found in ſome of our houſes by ſearch: we ſay, from truth of heart, in the Lord's fear, that we do utterly abhor and abominate the thoughts thereof, and much more the actions; and do hereby challenge both city and country (in our innocency herein) as being not able to prove the things whereof they accuſe us; and do for evermore declare the inventors of ſuch reports, to be liars, and wicked deviſers of miſchief, and corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. God that is above all will juſtify our innocency herein, who well knows our integrity in what we here declare, the Lord lay it not to their charge. In the time of building the decayed houſe of God, <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah (wicked counſellors) hired Shemaiah to make good Nehemiah afraid;</hi> and laboured againſt him, that they might have <hi>matter for an evil report;</hi> that they might reproach him, and hinder the building of the houſe of God, <hi>Neh.</hi> vi. 12. <hi>For I have heard,</hi> ſaith the prophet, <hi>the defaming of many; Report, ſay they, and we will report it,</hi> Jer. xx. 10.</p>

               <p>Many of the Baptiſts believe the Millennium, or the ſaints living and reigning with Chriſt upon earth 1000 years, for which there have not been wanting many judicious advocates; others, that it is a duty to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from blood, and things ſtrangled, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 19. that there is an intermediate ſtate, or hades. Several congregations are Sabbatarians, or obſervers of the Saturday, or ſeventh-day Sabbath; others practiſe praying over the ſick, and anointing them with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oil, of the bleſſings on which practice proofs are not wanting. Others think the impoſition or laying on of

But if the reader deſires to ſee the reaſons for theſe opinions, he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to conſult Mr. Grantham Killingworth's judicious account of the principles and practices of the General Baptiſts, in his letter to the Rev.

               <p>The church ſent meſſengers to thoſe miniſters whom they particularly deſired to act in this affair, and gave a general invitation to all the reſt to honour them with their preſence on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly being come together, at the meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in Barbican, on the day appointed, Mr. Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well went firſt up into the pulpit, and read the third and fourth chapters of the firſt epiſtle to Timothy; after which he prayed for that church, for the perſons called to offices in it, for the preſence of God, and the aſſiſtance of his grace in the duties to be that day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Next Mr. Benj. Stinton went up, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſermon from <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 1. from whence, according to the province aſſigned him, he endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the office and duties both of an elder and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. Then followed Mr. Nathaniel Hodges, who choſe for his text, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5. from whence he took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, among other things, to explain and vindicate the form of ordination. After this, the miniſters, and thoſe who were to be ordained, being together in the middle of the meeting-place, where the communion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0010800104:234"/>uſed to ſtand, Mr. Stinton, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ſtood up and ſaid, "It is deſired that all thoſe who are members of the church which uſually meets in this place, would draw together in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the meeting-houſe, and that the reſt of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly would ſeparate themſelves, either by going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the galleries, or the remote parts of the place." Then, directing his ſpeech particularly to the church, he ſaid, "We have been informed by meſſengers from you, that you have choſen our honoured and beloved brother, Mr. Joſeph Burroughs
<note n="*" place="bottom">This worthy and pious divine died between two and three years ſince, at his houſe in St. John's ſquare, Clerkenwell, after a long life of uſefulneſs as a miniſter, and of virtue and benevolence as a man.</note>, to be your <hi>elder</hi> or <hi>overſeer,</hi> in the Lord, and have accordingly deſired him to take that office upon him; it will, however, be proper, that you ſhould now, in a more public manner, and before this aſſembly, declare and confirm your ſaid choice. All you, therefore, who do approve of, and confirm the choice you have made of Mr. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Burroughs to be your <hi>paſtor,</hi> and deſire that he ſhould now be ordained to that office, be pleaſed to ſignify it by the lifting up of your hands." When they had ſo done, the negative was put, but no hand lifted up againſt it. Then he turned to Mr. Joſeph Burroughs, and ſaid, "Brother Joſeph Burroughs, as this church has unanimouſly choſen and called you to be their paſtor, and do earneſtly deſire that you would take upon you that honourable, though diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult office; ſo we deſire you to ſignify unto us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do accept of their call, and are willing, for the ſake of Chriſt, and the good of this community, to be put into this office?" Hereupon Mr. Burroughs ſignified, that it had been his deſire, for many years paſt, to be uſeful to the ſouls of men in the work of the miniſtry; and that this continued to be the free choice of his mind, in preference to any other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0010800104:235"/>that, in purſuance of this deſire, he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to the ſtudy of the holy ſcriptures, and to other exerciſes that might prepare him for public uſefulneſs; that he wiſhed he had made better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his time, and was deeply ſenſible of his inſufficiency for diſcharging the work to which he was called, ſuitably to its great importance; but was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uſe his beſt endeavours, and placed his hope in the goodneſs of God, who, he was aſſured, was able to make him ſucceſsful; that the unanimity which this church had ſhewn, in chuſing him for their paſtor, gave him an encouraging proſpect of doing good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: and therefore he declared, that he took the overſight of this flock, not by conſtraint, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and ſhould reckon himſelf obliged, by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of this people's call to be their paſtor, and by being ſolemnly ſet apart for the office, to be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer in the doctrines and precepts of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, and to watch for their ſouls, as one that muſt hereafter give an account; and that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, in every part of his proceeding, to make the holy ſcripture his only rule and ſtandard. Then, after a ſhort prayer ſuitable to the occaſion, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preſent laid their right hands upon his head, and Mr. Stinton, in the name of the whole, pronounced the words of ordination, as followeth:</p>
               <p>"Brother Joſeph Burroughs, we do, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and with the conſent of this church, ordain thee to be an elder, biſhop, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of this church of Jeſus Chriſt." And their hands continuing on his head, Mr. Stinton put up a ſhort prayer to God for him and the congregation
<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be obſerved here, that there are ſome amongſt the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts who object againſt this form of ordination, though uſually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their churches, believing it ſavours too much of men's aſſeming too great power to themſelves, in their ſetting others apart to the miniſtry; and alſo believing, that the Apoſtles themſelves, in ordinations, uſed not this form, <hi>We ordain thee;</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline pronouncing any words of ordination, and only pray to God for a bleſſing on the paſtor elect, laying their hands upon his head, which they hold is ordination ſufficient, and all that they know with certainty reſpecting the practice of the Apoſtles, who laid their hands over the perſons whom they ſet apart, and prayed to God in their behalf.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:0010800104:236"/>After the ordination of Mr. Burroughs, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the ordination of two deacons, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: Mr. Stinton ſtood up and ſaid, "We muſt now addreſs ourſelves again to you, the members of the congregation, that ſtatedly worſhip God in this place. We were informed by your meſſengers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, that you have choſen two perſons from amongſt yourſelves unto the office of deacons, in this church of Chriſt, viz. brother Matthew Shelſwell, and brother George Reynolds: it will therefore be neceſſary that you ſhould in this, as you have in the other caſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and confirm your election. All you, therefore, that do approve and confirm your former choice of brother Matthew Shelſwell to be a deacon in this church, and deſire that he may now be ordained to that ſervice, be pleaſed to ſignify it by the lifting up of your hands." And then the negative was put. After this the ſame queſtion was put, both in the affirmative and negative, with reſpect unto the other; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared they were both unanimouſly choſen: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being aſked; whether they accepted the church's call to this work, and were willing to take this office upon them? they anſwered, they were. Then the deacons elect kneeled down, and the miniſters, laying their right hands upon their heads, ordained them, Mr. Mulliner putting up a prayer to God, ſuitable to this part of the ſolemnity; and then he went up into the pulpit, and preached from 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 12, 13. in which, according to the province aſſigned him, he treated of the duties of the members of a Chriſtian church to their officers, both elders and deacons; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0010800104:237"/>which he prayed, then a pſalm of thankſgiving was ſung, at the concluſion of which the aſſembly was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with one of the apoſtolical benedictions.</p>

               <p>THE hiſtory of this ſect or brotherhood ſhould be drawn with a very impartial pen: they have, from their differing not only in the fundamentals, but in dreſs and form of ſpeech, from other Chriſtians (if I may be permitted to call them ſo), been ſubject to the moſt low and illiberal abuſe. The writers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſentiments have ſtored up ſo many calumnies and falſehoods, when they have had occaſion to mention them, that it is a difficult taſk to ſeparate fiction from fact. Therefore, as my intent is to afford impartial juſtice to my ſubject, I think I cannot better do ſo than by recurring to their own writers, not only for their hiſtory, but for an account of their doctrine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
               <p>The appellative QUAKERS was beſtowed upon them as a name of reproach and contempt, taken from the ſtrugglings and agitations viſible in their ſpeakers or preachers, when under thoſe influences they eſteemed divine. They modeſtly acquieſce in making uſe of this term when they addreſs the throne, and in their common tranſactions with the world: but the name they uſe amongſt themſelves is that of <hi>friends</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Sewell's Hiſtory, folio, p. 6 &amp; 672.</note>, which they borrow from primitive example, viz. <hi>The friends ſalute thee.—Greet the friends,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. John iii. Eph. xiv. Acts xxvii. 3, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>However agreeable to the goſpel the ſentiments of theſe people may be found (for from different ſenſes
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0010800104:238"/>and interpretations of ſcripture moſt of the ſects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us derive themſelves), it is certain the firſt lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this ſect, as a ſeparate body, was George Fox, born in Leiceſterſhire, about the year 1624
<note n="*" place="bottom">Not at Drayton, in Lancaſhire, as Neale ſays.</note>. He was deſcended of honeſt and ſufficient parents, who brought him up in the national religion
<note n="†" place="bottom">Penn's Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of the Quakers, edit. 5. p. 82.</note>: but from a child he appeared <hi>religious, ſtill, ſolid,</hi> and <hi>obſerving,</hi> beyond his years, and uncommonly knowing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things. He was brought up to huſbandry, and other country-buſineſs, and was particularly inclined to the ſolitary occupation of a ſhepherd; "an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," ſays my author, "that very well ſuited his mind in ſeveral reſpects, both for its innocency and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; and was a juſt emblem of his after miniſtry and ſervice." In the year 1646, he entirely forſook the national church, in whoſe tenets he had been brought up, as before obſerved; and in 1647 he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled into Derbyſhire and Nottinghamſhire, without any ſet purpoſe of viſiting particular places, but in a ſolitary manner he walked through ſeveral towns and villages, which way ſoever his mind turned. "He faſted much," ſays Sewell, "and walked often in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired places, with no other companion but his Bible." "He viſited the moſt retired and religious people in thoſe parts," ſays Penn; "and ſome there were, ſhort of few, if any, in this nation, <hi>who waited for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Iſrael night and day;</hi> as Zacharias, Anna, and Simeon, did of old time. To theſe he was ſent, and theſe he ſought out in the neighbouring counties, and among them he ſojourned till his more ample mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry came upon him. At this time he taught, and was an example of <hi>ſilence,</hi> endeavouring to bring them from ſelf-performances; teſtifying of, and turning them to the <hi>light of Chriſt within them,</hi> and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to wait in <hi>patience,</hi> and to feel the power of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0010800104:239"/>it to ſtir in their hearts, that their knowledge and worſhip of God might ſtand in the power of an <hi>endleſs</hi> life, which was to be found in the <hi>Light,</hi> as it was obeyed in the manifeſtation of it in man: <hi>for in the word was life, and that life is the light of men. Life</hi> in the word, <hi>light</hi> in men; and <hi>life</hi> in men too, as the <hi>light</hi> is obeyed; the children of the <hi>light</hi> living by the life of the word, by which the word begets them again to God, which is the <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>new birth,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no coming into the kingdom of God, and to which whoever comes is greater than <hi>John;</hi> that is, than John's diſpenſation, which was not that of the kingdom, but the conſummation of the legal, and fore running of the goſpel-times, the time of the kingdom. Accordingly ſeveral meetings were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe parts; and thus his time was employed for ſome years."</p>
               <p>In the year 1652, "he had a viſitation of the <hi>great work</hi> of God in the earth, and of the way that he was to go forth, in a public miniſtry, to begin it." He directed his courſe northward, "and in every place where he came, if not before he came to it, he had his particular exerciſe and ſervice <hi>ſhewn</hi> to him, ſo that the Lord was his <hi>leader</hi> indeed." He made great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of converts to his opinions, and many pious and good men joined him in his miniſtry
<note n="*" place="bottom">Some of the moſt eminent were, Richard Farnſworth, James Naylor, William Dewſberry, Thomas Aldam, Francis Howgil, Edward Burroughs, John Camm, John Audland, Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne, &amp;c. &amp;c. who were the firſt preachers amongſt the Quakers.</note>. Theſe were drawn forth eſpecially to viſit the public aſſemblies, to reprove, reform, and exhort them; ſometimes in markets, fairs, ſtreets, and by the highway-ſide, "calling people to repentance, and to return to the Lord, with their hearts as well as their mouths; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them to the light of Chriſt within them, to ſee, examine, and conſider their ways by, and to eſchew the evil, and do the <hi>good and acceptable will of God.</hi>"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0010800104:240"/>They were not without oppoſition in the work they imagined themſelves called to, being often ſet in the ſtocks, ſtoned, beaten, whipped and impriſoned, tho', as my author obſerves, honeſt men, of good report, that had left wives, children, houſes and lands, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them with a <hi>living call</hi> to repentance. But theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive methods rather forwarded than abated their zeal, and in thoſe parts they brought over many proſelytes, and amongſt them ſeveral magiſtrates, and others of the better ſort. They apprehended the Lord had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to pull off their hats to any one, high or low, and required them to ſpeak to the people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, in the language of <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee.</hi> They ſcrupled bidding people good-morrow, or good-night; nor might they bend the knee to any one, even in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority. Both men and women went in a plain and ſimple dreſs, different from the faſhion of the times. They neither gave nor accepted any titles of reſpect or honour, nor would they call any man maſter, on earth. Several texts of ſcripture they quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in defence of theſe ſingularities; ſuch as, <hi>Swear not at all.—How can ye believe who receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour which comes from God only?</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. They placed the baſis of religion in an inward light, and an extraordinary impulſe of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>In 1654, their firſt ſeparate meeting in London was held in the houſe of Robert Dring, in Watling ſtreet, (for by that time they had ſpread themſelves into all parts of the kingdom, and had in many places ſet up meetings or aſſemblies, particularly in Lancaſhire and the adjacent parts) but they were ſtill expoſed to great perſecutions and trials of every kind. One of them, in a letter to the Protector, Oliver Cromwell, repreſents, "That tho' there are no penal laws in force obliging men to comply with the eſtabliſhed religion, yet the Quakers are expoſed upon other accounts; they are fined and impriſoned for refuſing to take an oath; for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0010800104:241"/>not paying their tithes; for diſturbing the public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and meeting in the ſtreets, and places of public reſort; ſome of them have been whipped for vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and for their plain ſpeeches to the magiſtrate."</p>
               <p>Under favour of the then toleration they opened their meeting at the Bull and Mouth inn, in Alderſgate ſtreet, where women as well as men were moved to ſpeak. Their zeal tranſported them to ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances, which laid them ſtill more open to the laſh of their enemies, who exerciſed various ſeverities upon them throughout the next reign. Upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Venner's mad inſurrection
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. iii. of this work, p. 457.</note>, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having publiſhed a proclamation, forbidding the Anabaptiſts, Quakers, and Fifth-monarchy men, "to aſſemble or meet together under pretence of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, except it be in ſome parochial church, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or in private houſes, by the perſons there inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting," all meetings in other places being declared to be unlawful and riotous, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. the Quakers thought it expedient to addreſs the King thereon, which they did in the following words:</p>
               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>Oh King CHARLES!</p>
                  <p>Our deſire is, that thou mayeſt live for ever in the fear of God and thy council. We beſeech thee, and thy council, to read theſe following lines, in tender bowels, and compaſſion for our ſouls, and for your good.</p>
                  <p>And this conſider, we are about four hundred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, in and about this city, of men and women from their families, beſides, in the county goals, about ten hundred, we deſire that our meetings may not be broken up, but that all may come to a fair trial, that our innocency may be cleared up —.</p>
                  <p>London, 16th day, eleventh month, 1660.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0010800104:242"/>On the 28th of the ſame month they publiſhed the declaration referred to in their addreſs, intitled, <hi>A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from the harmleſs and innocent people of God call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Quakers, againſt all ſedition, plotters and fighters in the world, for removing the ground of jealouſy and ſuſpicion, from both magiſtrates and people in the kingdom, concerning wars and fightings.</hi> It was preſented to the King the 21ſt day of the eleventh month, 1660, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them upon his royal word, that they ſhould not ſuffer for their opinions, as long as they lived peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but his promiſes were very little regarded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>In 1661, they aſſumed courage to petition the houſe of Lords for a toleration of their religion, and for a diſpenſation from taking the oaths, which they held unlawful, not from any diſaffection to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a belief that they were leſs obliged by an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, but from a perſuaſion that all oaths were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; and that ſwearing upon the moſt ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was forbidden in the New Teſtament. Their petition was rejected, and inſtead of granting them relief, an act was paſſed againſt them, the preamble to which ſet forth, "That whereas ſeveral perſons have taken up an opinion, that an oath, even before a magiſtrate, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and contrary to the word of God; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, under pretence of religious worſhip, the ſaid perſons do aſſemble in great numbers in ſeveral parts of the kingdom, ſeparating themſelves from the reſt of his Majeſty's ſubjects, and the public congregations and uſual places of divine worſhip:" be it therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That if any ſuch perſons, after the 24th of March 1661-2, ſhall refuſe to take an oath when law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tendered, or perſuade others to do it, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in writing, or otherwiſe, the unlawfulneſs of taking an oath; or if they ſhall aſſemble for religious worſhip to the number of five or more, of the age of fifteen, they ſhall for the firſt offence forfeit five pounds; for the ſecond, ten pounds; and for the third ſhall abjure
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0010800104:243"/>the realm, or be tranſported to the plantations: and the juſtices of peace at their open ſeſſions may hear and finally determine in the affair."</p>
               <p>This act had a moſt dreadful effect upon the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, tho' it was well known and notorious theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious perſons were far from ſedition or diſaffection to the government. George Fox, in his addreſs to the King, acquaints him, that three thouſand and ſixty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight of their friends had been impriſoned ſince his Majeſty's reſtoration; that their meetings were daily broken up by men with clubs and arms, and their friends thrown into the water, and trampled under foot, till the blood guſhed out, which gave riſe to their meeting in the open ſtreets. A relation was printed, ſigned by twelve witneſſes, which ſays, that more than four thouſand two hundred Quakers were impriſoned; and of them five hundred were in and about London, and the ſuburbs; ſeveral of whom were dead in the goals.</p>
               <p>However, they even gloried in their ſufferings, which increaſed every day; ſo that in 1665, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate years, they were harraſſed without example. As they perſiſted reſolutely to aſſemble, openly, at the Bull and Mouth, before-mentioned, the ſoldiers, and other officers, dragged them from thence to priſon, till Newgate was filled with them, and multitudes died of cloſe confinement, in that and other goals.</p>
               <p>Six hundred of them, ſays an account publiſhed at this time, were in priſon, merely <hi>for religion-ſake,</hi> of whom ſeveral were baniſhed to the plantations. "In ſhort (ſays Mr. Neale) the Quakers gave ſuch full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to the informers, that they had leſs leiſure to attend the meetings of other Diſſenters."</p>
               <p>Yet, under all theſe calamities, they behaved with patience and modeſty towards the government, and upon occaſion of the Rye-houſe plot
<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. iii. of this work, p. 484.</note> in 1682, thought
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0010800104:244"/>proper to declare their innocence of that ſham plot, in an addreſs to the King, wherein, appealing to the ſearcher of all hearts, they ſay, "
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sewell's Hiſtory, p. 585.</note> Their principles do not allow them to take up defenſive arms, much leſs to avenge themſelves for the injuries they receive from others: that they continually pray for the King's ſafety and preſervation; and therefore take this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion humbly to beſeech his Majeſty to compaſſionate their ſuffering friends, with whom the goals are ſo fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they want air, to the apparent hazard of their lives, and to the endangering an infection in divers places. Beſides, many houſes, ſhops, barns, and fields, are ranſacked, and the goods, corn, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſwept away, to the diſcouraging of trade and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and impoveriſhing great numbers of quiet and induſtrious people; and this for no other cauſe, but for the exerciſe of a tender conſcience in the worſhip of Almighty God, who is ſovereign Lord and King in men's conſciences —."</p>
               <p>On the acceſſion of James II. they addreſſed that monarch honeſtly and plainly, telling him, "
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 594.</note> We are come to teſtify our ſorrow for the death of our good

               <p>When James, by his diſpenſing power, granted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Diſſenters, they began to enjoy ſome reſt from their troubles; and indeed it was high time, for they were ſwelled to an enormous amount. They, the year before this (to them glad releaſe), in a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to James for a ceſſation of their ſufferings, ſet

Three hundred and fifty have died in priſon ſince the year 1680; in London, the goal of Newgate has been crowded, within this two years, ſometimes with near twenty in a room, whereby ſeveral have been ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and others, who have been taken out ſick, have died of malignant fevers within a few days.

The fines upon one juſtice's warrant have amounted to many hundred pounds; frequently ten pounds a warrant, and five warrants together for fifty pounds to one man; and for non-payment, all his goods carried away by cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads. They ſpare neither widow nor fatherleſs, nor poor families, nor leave them ſo much as a bed to lie upon.

                  <p>WE ſincerely profeſs faith in God, by his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son Jeſus Chriſt, as being our light and life, and our only way to the Father, and alſo our only mediator and advocate with the Father:—We believe that God created all things; he made the world by his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, are one in divine being, inſeparable, one true living and eternal God, bleſſed for ever:—yet that this Word or Son of God, in the fulneſs of time, took fleſh, became perfect man according to the fleſh, was miraculouſly conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of the Virgin Mary; and alſo farther declared to be the Son of God, according to the ſpirit of ſanctification, by the reſurrection from the dead: that in this Word was life, and the ſame life was the light of men; the life and light within us: and that men are to believe in this light, Chriſt Jeſus: that as man he died for our ſins, roſe again, and was received up into glory, he having, by that one great univerſal offering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſacrifice for peace, atonement, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation between God and man:—that Jeſus Chriſt, who ſitteth on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty, in the heavens, is our King, High Prieſt, and Prophet in his church, and by his ſpirit alſo maketh interceſſion in our hearts:—that the goſpel of the grace of God ſhould be preached in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, being one in power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, and indiviſible in the great work of man's ſalvation; and that divine worſhip is to be paid to the Son, from his union or oneneſs of the Father and Son, and that our prayers are accepted thro' him:—
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0010800104:249"/>that Chriſt's body that was crucified, was not the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; yet, by the power of God, was raiſed from the dead, changed into a more glorious condition, and aſcended into heaven and glory. True and living faith in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of the living God, reſpects his being and fulneſs, and alſo his making himſelf known in the ſoul in every degree of his light, life, ſpirit, grace and truth, the immediate cauſe, author, object, and ſtrength of our living faith, &amp;c. Which light and life of the Son of God, within, truly obeyed and followed, will bring us to the adoption of ſons. It is true, we are not to undervalue the holy ſcriptures, nor ſlight the preaching of the word, as being outward helps and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the hand of God for the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: nor do we ſet them in oppoſition to the light or ſpirit of God or Chriſt within; for his faithful meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are miniſters thereof, to turn people to the ſame light and ſpirit in them.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that great is the myſtery of godlineſs in itſelf: that God ſhould be manifeſted in the fleſh, &amp;c. —and it is a great and precious myſtery of godlineſs and Chriſtianity, that Chriſt ſhould be ſpiritually and effectually manifeſted in mens hearts:—Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in every true believer, freeing them from the bondage of ſin, as their wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption. This myſtery of godlineſs in its own being and glory (in many hid, and in ſome revealed) hath been, and muſt be teſtified, preached, and believed, where God is pleaſed to give commiſſion, and prepare peoples hearts for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>As touching <hi>the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> we believe, as the ſcripture teſtifies, that <hi>if in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable:</hi> that the ſoul or ſpirit of every man and woman ſhall be reſerved in its own diſtinct and proper being (ſo as there ſhall be as many ſouls in the world to come as in this) and every ſeed (yea every ſoul: ſhall have its proper body, as God is pleaſed to give it. <hi>A natural body is ſown, a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0010800104:250"/>ſpiritual body is raiſed;</hi> and, tho' <hi>this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall put on immortality,</hi> the change ſhall be ſuch, as <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;</hi> ſo we expect our ſpiritual bodies, in the reſurrection, ſhall far excel what our bodies now are; but how the dead are raiſed, or <hi>with what body they come,</hi> we ſubmit to the wiſdom and pleaſure of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for we cannot preſume to determine.</p>
                  <p>As to the doctrine of the eternal judgment, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live that God hath committed all judgment unto the Son, Jeſus Chriſt, and he is both judge of quick and dead, and of the ſtates and ends of all mankind. That this Son of man, who hath ſo deeply ſuffered, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſo great indignities, ſhall, in the laſt and great day, manifeſtly appear in glory, attended with all his glorious heavenly hoſt and retinue, to the terror and amazement of thoſe who have denied him; but to the glory and triumph of the righteous, the faithful fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and friends of Chriſt. It is a righteous thing with God, that they who ſuffer with him ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him in glory and dignity, when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at laſt judge of the world and prince thereof:— whilſt thoſe who now evade and reject the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and judgment of the light, and ſhut up the records or books thereof in their own conſcience, they ſhall be at laſt opened, and every one judged of theſe things recorded therein, according to their works.</p>

                  <p>Beſides theſe ſeveral articles, which were in general received and approved, there were four articles drawn up and preſented to parliament by George Whitehead, occaſioned by a charge of Socinianiſm, at that time, which are as follow:<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0010800104:251"/>Be it known to all, that we ſincerely believe and profeſs,</p>
                  <p>I. That Jeſus of Nazareth, who was born of the Virgin Mary, is the true Meſſiah, the Chriſt, the Son of God, to whom all the Prophets gave witneſs, and that we do highly value his death, ſufferings, works, offices, and merits, for the redemption of mankind, together with his laws, doctrine, and miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>II. That this very Chriſt of God, who is <hi>the Lamb of God, that takes away the ſins of the world,</hi> was ſlain, was dead, and is alive for ever in his divine eternal glory, dominion and power, with the Father.</p>
                  <p>III. That the holy ſcriptures are of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as being given by inſpiration of God.</p>
                  <p>IV. And that magiſtracy or civil government is God's ordinance, the good ends thereof being for the puniſhment of evil doers, and the praiſe of them that do well.</p>
                  <p>Some other points of faith or opinion, or wherein they are diſtinguiſhed from the eſtabliſhed church and other denominations of Chriſtians, viz.</p>

                     <hi>Of the</hi> SACRAMENTS.—<hi>Of the</hi> LORD'S SUPPER <hi>they ſay,</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>As for the word Sacrament, we do not read of it in the ſcripture; but as for the body and blood of Chriſt, I own, and that there is no remiſſion without blood: we do believe, according as it is written, that Chriſt, at his laſt ſupper, took bread and brake it, and gave it to his diſciples, and alſo took the cup and bleſſed it, and ſaid unto them, <hi>and as often as ye do this, you ſhew forth the Lord's death till he come;</hi> and this we believe they did, and did eat their bread in ſingleneſs of heart: but when Chriſt came again to them, according to his promiſe, they ſaid, we being many are one bread, for we are all partakers of this one bread; for there is a difference between that bread which he brake at his laſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0010800104:252"/>ſupper, wherein they were to ſhew forth his death as in a ſign, and this whereof they ſpake, they being many are one bread, for herein they were come more into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and, to ſpeak more myſtically, as they knew it in the Spirit. R. HUBBERTHORN.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm, any more than the Lord's ſupper, is not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by this people. As to the former they ſay, "It is not outward waſhing with water that maketh the heart clean, by which men are fitted for heaven." Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay
<note n="*" place="bottom">See his maſterly and ſhrewd Apology.</note> endeavours to prove this propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> "As there is one Lord and one faith, ſo there is one baptiſm, which is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience before God, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. And this baptiſm is a pure and ſpiritual thing, <hi>to wit,</hi> the baptiſm of the ſpirit and fire, by which we are buried with him, that being waſhed and purged from our ſins, we may <hi>walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life:</hi> of which the baptiſm of John was a figure, which was commanded for a time, and not to continue for ever. As to the baptiſm of infants, it is a mere human tradition, for which neither precept nor practice is to be found in all the ſcripture." Concerning the Lord's ſupper, he advances in his 13th propoſition, "that the communion of the body and blood of Chriſt is inward and ſpiritual, which is the participation of his fleſh and blood, by which the infant man is daily nouriſhed in the hearts of thoſe in whom Chriſt dwells; of which things the breaking of bread by Chriſt with his diſciples was a figure, which they even uſed in the church for a time, who had received the ſubſtance, for the cauſe of the weak; even as <hi>abſtaining from things ſtrangled, and from blood;</hi> the <hi>waſhing one another's feet,</hi> and the <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſick with oil;</hi> all which are commanded with no leſs authority and ſolemnity than the former; yet ſeeing they are but the ſhadows of better things, they ceaſe in ſuch as have obtained the <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>" It is not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0010800104:253"/>within my province to declare my ſentiments of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with which this famous Apologiſt has endeavoured to demonſtrate theſe propoſitions; but I can declare with truth, that many pieces in anſwer thereto, which I have read, do little honour to the cauſe they eſpouſe, and betray a very rigid and perſecuting ſpirit.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> CHURCH DISCIPLINE <hi>and</hi> GOVERNMENT <hi>of the People called</hi> QUAKERS.</head>
                  <p>"IN the year 1667, I was moved (ſays George Fox
<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Journal.</note>) to recommend the ſetting up of monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings throughout the nation, friends hitherto having only had their general quarterly meetings
<note n="†" place="bottom">In the beginning (ſays Dr. Rutty) the buſineſs now properly belonging to the monthly meetings, was tranſacted at the quarterly meetings, where a larger body of friends being aſſembled, was more neceſſary for mutual help and advice, eſpecially in thoſe times of ſuffering and weakneſs.</note>; and the Lord opened unto me, and let me ſee what I muſt do, and how mens and womens monthly and quarterly meetings ſhould be ordered and eſtabliſhed in England and other nations; and that I ſhould write to them, where I came not, to do the ſame. Accordingly, having recommended the ſetting up of five monthly meetings in the city of London, to take care of God's glory, and to admoniſh and exhort ſuch as walked diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and not according to truth; then I paſſed forth into the counties again, and adviſed that month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meetings ſhould be ſettled there alſo, for the ſame purpoſes, which was done according to the goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, in and by the power of God, the authority of our meetings being the power of God; and in the year 1668, I writ to Ireland and to Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and other parts of America, adviſing friends to ſettle their monthly meetings in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0010800104:254"/>alſo, which was accordingly done
<note n="*" place="bottom">He afterwards viſited thoſe countries in perſon, and aſſiſted them in the eſtabliſhing of thoſe meetings.</note>; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the good effects of the ſettlement of thoſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſoon appeared."—"They did make a great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation amongſt people, inſomuch that the very juſtices took notice of the uſefulneſs and ſervice thereof; and ſeveral who had run out were brought to condemn what they had done amiſs, and through repentance came in again; and many have bleſſed the Lord God that ever he did ſend me forth in this ſervice, now all coming to have a concern and care for God's honour and glory, that his name be not blaſphemed, which they do profeſs, and to ſee that all who profeſs the truth do walk in the truth, and in righteouſneſs and holineſs."</p>
                  <p>Thus were monthly meetings for men and women formed: for their authority in the latter caſe ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxv. 25, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> xvi. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 3. <hi>Titus</hi> ii. 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. George Fox has thus given us the uſe of them, "That the faithful women who were called to the belief of the truth, being made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame precious faith, and heirs of the ſame everlaſting goſpel of life and ſalvation, might in like manner come into the poſſeſſion and practice of the goſpel-order, and be therein meet-helps to the men in the reſtoration, in the ſervice of the truth, in the affairs of the church, as they are outwardly in civil or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, that ſo the family of God, women as well as men, might know, poſſeſs, perform and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their offices and ſervices in the houſe of God, whereby the poor might be the better taken care of, the younger ſort inſtructed and informed in the way of God, the looſe and diſorderly reproved and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the fear of the Lord, the clearneſs of perſons propounding marriage more cloſely and ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, in the wiſdom of God; and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0010800104:255"/>of the ſpiritual body, the church, might watch over and be helpful to one another in love."</p>
                  <p>"
<note n="*" place="bottom">Penn's Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of the Quakers.</note> The monthly meetings ſo ſet up were more or fewer, as the caſe required, in every reſpective county, four or ſix meetings of worſhip uſually making one meeting of buſineſs, and theſe monthly meetings in each county made up one quarterly meeting, where the moſt zealous and eminent friends of the county aſſembled to communicate, adviſe, and help one another, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when any buſineſs ſeemed difficult, or a monthly meeting was tender of determining a matter; and theſe ſeveral quarterly meetings digeſted the reports of their monthly meetings, and prepared one for each reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive county againſt the yearly meeting, in which all quarterly meetings reſolve, which is held in London, where the churches in this nation, and other nations and provinces meet, by choſen members of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective counties, both mutually to communicate their church-affairs, and to adviſe and be adviſed in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending caſe to edification. The minutes of the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting upon the ſeveral matters that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration therein, are drawn up (to the end that the reſpective quarterly and monthly meetings may be informed of all proceedings) together with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exhortation to holineſs, purity and charity. Theſe meetings are opened and uſually concluded in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn waiting upon God; and it is further to be noted, in theſe ſolemn aſſemblies for the church's ſervice, there is no one preſides among them, after the manner of the aſſemblies of other people; Chriſt only being their preſident, as he is pleaſed to appear in life and wiſdom in any one or more of them, to whom, whatever be their capacity and degree, the reſt adhere with a firm unity; not of authority, but conviction, which is the divine authority, and way of Chriſt's power and ſpirit in his people, making good his bleſſed promiſe, that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0010800104:256"/>he would be in the midſt of his, where and whenever they were met together in his name, even to the end of the world."</p>
                  <p>"Such, ſays Dr. Rutty, was the conſtitution of the ſeveral meetings for diſcipline, and the orderly ſubordination of monthly to quarterly, and of theſe to the yearly meeting, this laſt being the repreſentative of the whole body of the people. Thus, if any brother apprehend himſelf injured by the determination of a monthly meeting, he hath liberty of appeal from thence to the quarterly, and from this laſt, if ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d be, to the yearly or national meeting. And monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſo far ſubordinate to the quarterly, that at the yearly meeting 1715 it was agreed, that no monthly meeting ſhall divide itſelf into two ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate monthly meetings, either by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of love, or any other difference among them in that meeting; nor without the conſent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the quarterly meeting. Before I cloſe my account of the meetings for diſcipline, it is neceſſary to obſerve that there is alſo another meeting which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes for the benefit of the whole body, in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the yearly meeting, being a deputation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the yearly meeting, commonly called <hi>The meeting for ſufferings,</hi> which holds correſpondence with the ſeveral counties, and even with other nations, in order to ſolicit for eaſe from the government in any caſe of ſuffering for conſcience ſake, or to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe helpful to any of the inferior meetings on any emergency

                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0010800104:258"/>and <hi>limit</hi> of church-power.

                  <p>The way of their proceeding againſt ſuch as have lapſed or tranſgreſſed is this. He is viſited by ſome of them, and the matter of fact laid home to him, be it any evil practice againſt known and general virtue, or any branch of their particular teſtimony, which he, in common, profeſſeth with them. They labour with him in much love and zeal, for the <hi>good</hi> of his ſoul, the honour of God, and <hi>reputation</hi> of their profeſſion, to <hi>own</hi> his fault and condemn it, in as ample a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the evil or ſcandal was given by him; which for the moſt part is performed by ſome <hi>written</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony under the parties hand: and if it ſo happen, that the party prove <hi>refractory,</hi> and is not willing to clear the truth, they profeſs, from the reproach of his or her evil doing or unfaithfulneſs, they, after repeated intreaties and due waiting for a token of repentance, give forth a paper to diſown ſuch a fact, and the party offending; <hi>recording</hi> the ſame as a teſtimony of their care for the honour of the truth they profeſs. And if he or ſhe ſhall clear their <hi>profeſſion</hi> and themſelves, by ſincere acknowledgment of their fault, and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſo doing, they are <hi>received</hi> and <hi>looked upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as members of their communion:</hi> for as God, ſo his true people, <hi>upbraid no man</hi> after repentance."</p>
                  <p>"As thoſe meetings became eſtabliſhed, and friends grew in the exerciſe of Chriſtian diſcipline, it was, in divers places, judged expedient to chuſe out of them perſons of approved integrity, to <hi>viſit the families</hi> of friends, whoſe buſineſs in general ſeems to have been well deſcribed, in thoſe terms which the nature of the thing rendered familiar among the brethren, of <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over one another in love.</hi> This branch of Chriſtian

The qualifications required in theſe men are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, in general terms, in the records of the <hi>nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> meeting at the firſt inſtitution of them, <hi>viz.</hi> "That they ſhould be juſt in dealings among men, free from worldly incumbrances, and all coming up in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to anſwer their high and honourable calling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their capacities and abilities." And the general tenor of their commiſſion is thus deſcribed, "That friends might be cautioned againſt running into any exceſs or extreme in trading or farming; that they might be kept out of airineſs in deportment, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of words in bargaining, buying, or ſelling; and ſuperfluity in apparel, furniture, or houſehold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff." They were not, however, reſtricted to theſe particulars only; but, in the courſe of their exerciſe in this weighty ſervice, were led to many other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſubjects of counſel and admonition; and indeed the zeal and vigilance of the brethren in Ireland, in this branch of diſcipline, was truly memorable; of which I think it well worth while to give a ſhort ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen from the writings of an experienced elder
<note n="†" place="bottom">Joſeph Pike, in an epiſtle to the national meeting, publiſhed in Dublin, A. D. 1726.</note>, and other records, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt of all, they that were choſen for <hi>viſitors</hi> met together, and after waiting for a time
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0010800104:260"/>in ſilence upon the Lord, any one, as he found it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mind, ſpoke what appeared to him ſuitable to the occaſion, and every one, in a tender, brotherly manner, ſubmitted himſelf to the examination of his brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> how far each one ſtood clear himſelf with reſpect to thoſe things concerning which he was about to adviſe others. Such examination being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, they thus proceeded in their viſits. When they came to a family, they ſat down with them, and firſt waited a while upon the Lord, and then, as it aroſe upon the minds of any, advice was given them ſuitable to their reſpective ſtates and conditions; ſometimes to all the family together, and ſometimes to particular perſons apart, as they ſaw occaſion, particularly and principally directing them to the witneſs of God, and gift of his Holy Spirit in themſelves, as that by which alone they could grow in truth, and witneſs their hearts cleanſed, which would work an effectual regulation in their outward demeanour; and then they proceeded to the mention of ſome inſtances of this, as occaſion offered, and recommended to their obſervation the particular minutes or advices which had been given forth from meetings. But, more particularly, in theſe family-viſits, friends were exhorted to diligence in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of Almighty God, and a zealous attendance on the meetings appointed for that purpoſe, both on the firſt days and on other days of the week; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but to a fervent exerciſe of ſpirit in thoſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and parents, maſters, and miſtreſſes of families, were adviſed to encourage their children and ſervants in this religious exerciſe. They were alſo ſeverally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to anſwer the high and holy calling of the Lord, in coming up in their ſervices in the church, according to the underſtanding received, and ability of body and ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Next, as to <hi>trading</hi> and <hi>dealing,</hi>—That none might involve themſelves in the cares and incumbrances of the world, ſo as to be hindered from ſerving the Lord
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0010800104:261"/>with that freedom of ſpirit which becomes a people call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his name; alſo, that none profeſſing truth and righteouſneſs might run into debts, or contract great trades beyond the bounds of moderation, or their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to manage;—that they ſhould be punctual in keeping their words and promiſes;—that they ſhould be circumſpect in their lives and converſations at all times;—avoid unneceſſary frequenting of alehouſes and taverns, and faſhioning themſelves according to the vain, unſettled cuſtoms of the world, whether in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel or houſe-furniture. Laſtly, the good education of youth was ſtrongly recommended to parents, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in plainneſs of habit and ſpeech, honeſt labour, and ſuitable trades and employments; and that they ſhould reſtrain them as much as in their power from all unfit liberties in recreations, and thoſe hurtful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that youth is inclined unto."</p>
                  <p>The crimes and irregularities which render the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers liable either to be admoniſhed or diſowned as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are, a neglect of the meetings appointed for the worſhip of God, injuſtice and frauds of all kinds, defamation, breach of the marriage-covenant, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, drunkenneſs, gaming, and ſwearing. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the above enumerated evils condemned by them, in common with other profeſſors of Chriſtianity, there were alſo certain practices, which ſeemed to be either leſſer degrees of thoſe evils, or to have a tendency to promote them, or, in the view of this people, to be hurtful to the ſouls of men and their ſpiritual proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inconſiſtent with that Chriſtian teſtimony God had called them to bear againſt the corruptions of the world, which became the ſubjects of the church's care to preſerve her members from, <hi>e. g.</hi> the unneceſſary frequenting of alehouſes or taverns, drinking of healths, ſuperfluities of proviſions at marriages or burials, the abuſe of our precious time in divers exerciſes called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations; as cock-fighting, horſe-races, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing play-houſes and muſic-meetings; alſo extravagance
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0010800104:262"/>and ſuperfluity in habit, furniture, ſpeech, and even in trading and farming; all theſe were and are deemed proper ſubjects of reproof and admonition. There are yet ſome other inſtances of unfaithfulneſs peculiarly cognizable by the church among this people, viz. 1. One brother going to law with another. 2. Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether private or public. 3. The payment of tithes or church-rates, ſo called, by any of this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was always cenſured among this people, as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the known ſenſe and judgment of the brethren, with regard to the ſupport of a Chriſtian mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and a trampling upon that teſtimony which they believed God had called them to bear againſt this antichriſtian yoke of oppreſſion, and was faithfully maintained by divers of the ancient brethren, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering impriſonment, even unto death, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. A mean ſubmiſſion to this yoke, for fear of ſuffering, was further condemnable, becauſe of its tendency to increaſe the ſufferings of the faithful, and ſtrengthen the hands of their adverſaries. This hath been always deemed ſo eſſential a point, that, from the firſt publication of the epiſtles from the yearly meeting of London to this preſent time, accounts are tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence of the ſufferings of friends in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; and not only ſo, but exhortations to faithfulneſs, in this reſpect, are rarely omitted.</p>
                  <p>Their method of procedure in regard to diſorderly perſons has been given above, in general terms; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, there are certain particularities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſuited to particular caſes.</p>
                  <p>Their care to ſupply the neceſſities of their poor, and that their offspring ſhall be properly educated, is a well-known branch of their diſcipline, a query to this purpoſe being conſtantly to be anſwered from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the general meetings: nor is their charity confined to their own poor, but extended to all others.</p>
                  <q>Their miniſters
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rutty, ut ſupra.</note>, although, according to the

How are miniſtering friends in love and unity one with another, and with faithful brethren in their own meeting? 2. Do none of them travel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, in the work of the miniſtry, without a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from their own monthly meeting? 3. Do they give way to each other, and to ſtrangers, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their gifts? 4. Do none overcharge themſelves with buſineſs, to the hindrance of their ſervice? 5.

                  <p>Their diſcipline, in relation to marriage, merits the attention of other profeſſors of Chriſtianity: <q>

                  <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                     <p>The principal conditions of their acceptance are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is an eſtabliſhed rule, that no man propoſe marriage to a woman without the previous conſent of his own and her parents or guardians; and if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled affections of any ſhould have precipitated him into a breach of this rule, he is required, purſuant to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0010800104:264"/>the advice of the yearly meeting of London 1707, to remove the offence, and give ſatisfaction
<note n="‡" place="bottom">As alſo the woman, if ſhe have encouraged it.</note> to ſuch parents and guardians, and to the meeting to which they do belong, by a due and open acknowledgment of the offence, and condemnation of himſelf for it, and to get the conſent of ſuch parents or guardians before he ſhall be permitted to proceed to accompliſh his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended marriage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the parties be of the ſame faith and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of religion, and profeſſed members of this ſociety.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That none ſhall marry within ſuch degrees of conſanguinity or affinity as are forbidden by the law of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whereas the admiſſion of any marriage to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, according to the rules of this ſociety, is an acknowledgment of the perſons thus admitted as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters of the community; if either of theſe ſhould formerly have been guilty of any miſdemeanour, whereby ſcandal had been brought on the ſociety, it hath, in ſuch caſe, been the conſtant practice in this nation, that, upon this ſolemn occaſion, ſuch ſhould condemn their fault, which, for the moſt part, is done in writing.</p>
                     <p>Where no obſtacles on any of theſe accounts appear, or having appeared, are removed, the meeting paſſes the propoſals of marriage, takes a minute thereof, and appoints proper perſons to enquire into the clearneſs of the parties from all others, and to hold correſpondence with other monthly meetings to the ſame purpoſe, if the parties have reſided in different places. It alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the intentions of marriage to be publiſhed at leaſt in two ſundry public meetings where the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſide, or have reſided, before the marriage be ſolemnized, in order that convenient time may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0010800104:265"/>for ſatisfaction concerning their clearneſs from all ſcandal, pre-contracts, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The parties are required to give their attendance a ſecond time at the monthly meeting, which is uſually the next enſuing, or the next after, where the perſons appointed to make the enquiry above mentioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an account of the reſult, which if it prove ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the meeting, the parties are at liberty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the accompliſhment of their marriage, for which purpoſe it was the ancient practice to appoint a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular meeting, whereat twelve faithful witneſſes, at leaſt, were required to be preſent; but of later years marriages in this nation have been commonly ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized in the ordinary public meetings for worſhip, which hath had this good effect, to make public and ſtrongly recommend this decent and comely order to all ſober and impartial obſervers. Here the man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man take each other as huſband and wife, and promiſe each other, with God's aſſiſtance, to be loving and faithful in that relation till death ſeparate them. Of all theſe proceedings a narrative is kept in the way of certificate, to which the ſaid parties firſt ſet their hands, thereby making it their own act and deed, and then divers of the relations, ſpectators, and auditors, ſet their names, as witneſſes of what they have ſaid and ſigned; and this certificate is afterwards regiſtered in the record belonging to the meeting where the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is ſolemnized.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another thing that always, in this nation, becomes the ſubject of the care of the ſame monthly meeting, <hi>viz.</hi> to appoint two perſons as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, to take care that the marriage be ſolemnized with modeſty and gravity, and to diſcourage ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of eating, drinking, apparel, wanton beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, &amp;c. upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>As to ſecond marriages, theſe two things chiefly fall under their care and cognizance:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0010800104:266"/>1. If the man be a widower, or the woman a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and have children by a former wife or huſband, that proviſion be previouſly made for ſuch children where it can conveniently be done.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Friends ſhould not proceed in ſecond marriages until a year is elapſed from the death of the former wife or huſband; and the practice accordingly hath been ſuch, and more early procedure condemned and forbidden as indecent.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To their yearly meeting held in London every Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuntide, which ſometimes laſteth four, five, or more days, are admitted ſuch as are ſent from all churches of that ſociety in the world, to give an account of the ſtate of their particular churches, which from ſome places is done only by writing; and from this meeting is ſent a <hi>general epiſtle</hi> to all the churches, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is printed, and ſometimes particular epiſtles are ſent to churches reſpectively, by which it is known in what condition their churches are every year; and in the ſaid epiſtle there is always recommended a godly life and converſation, and due care about the education of children. If it happens that the poor any where are in want, then that is ſupplied by others that have in ſtore, or ſometimes by an extraordinary collection. I have ſubjoined one of thoſe epiſtles for my readers ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <p>OUR ſalutation in the love of Chriſt Jeſus our bleſſed Lord is freely extended to you, whoſe tender care over, and favour to this our annual aſſembly, we do humbly and thankfully acknowledge, in the love, amity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condeſcenſion, and peaceable procedure thereof,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0010800104:267"/>with regard to the divine power and goodneſs of the Lord our God, and the ſervice of his church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſincerely deſiring the proſperity of his whole heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, even in all the churches of Chriſt among us, in his dear love, unity, and peace, to his eternal glory, and our univerſal comfort and perpetual joy in the kingdom of the dear Son of God.</p>
                  <p>We are truly comforted in that we underſtand there is ſuch a general concurrence and union among friends, which was our former earneſt deſires and counſel for true and univerſal love, unity, peace, and good order to be earneſtly endeavoured and maintained amongſt us, as a peculiar people choſen of the Lord out of this world, to bear a faithful teſtimony to his holy name and truth in all reſpects; and that all that is contrary be watched againſt and avoided, as ſtrife, diſcord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and diſputes tending to diviſions, may be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſuppreſſed and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Oh! that all the churches and congregations of the faithful would be excited by the Spirit of the dear Son of God, fervently to pray for the proſperity of his church and people throughout the world, that Sion may more and more ſhine in the beauty of holineſs, to the glory and praiſe of the King of Glory.</p>
                  <p>The friends and brethren, come up from the ſeveral quarterly meetings in this nation, have given a good account, to this meeting, of truth's proſperity, and that friends are generally at love and unity with one another; and by ſeveral epiſtles from North Carolina, Jerſey, Penſylvania. Maryland, Barbadoes, Holland, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland, and Wales, which have been read in this meeting, as alſo by verbal accounts given by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral friends that have lately travelled in divers parts of America and elſewhere, we have received comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a counts of the ſtate of truth and friends in thoſe parts, by which we are encouraged to hope truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in many places, and a concern grows upon friends
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0010800104:268"/>for the proſperity thereof, and that there is an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in people to hear the truth declared.</p>
                  <p>By the accounts brought up this year we find, that friends ſuffering in England and Wales amount to 4290l. chiefly for tithes, prieſts wages, and ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe rates; and that notwithſtanding four friends were diſcharged laſt year, there yet remain twenty friends priſoners on theſe accounts.</p>
                  <p>We adviſe that a tender care remain upon friends, in all places, to be faithful in keeping up our Chriſtian teſtimony againſt tithes, as being juſtly perſuaded it is that whereunto God hath called his people in this our day, we ſeeing by daily experience that ſuch as are not faithful therein, do thereby add to the ſufferings of other friends, and hinder their own growth and proſperity in the moſt bleſſed truth.</p>
                  <p>As touching the education of friends children, for which this meeting hath always a tender concern, we think it neceſſary to recommend to you the neceſſity there is of a care of preſerving of them in a plainneſs of ſpeech and habit ſuitable to our holy profeſſion; and alſo that no opportunity be omitted, nor any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours wanting, to inſtruct them in the principles of truth which we profeſs, that thereby they being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the operation thereof in themſelves, may find not only their ſpirits ſoftened and rendered fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impreſſions of the divine image, but may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from thence find themſelves under a neceſſity to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear clear in the ſeveral branches of our Chriſtian teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: and as this will be moſt beneficial to them, being the fruits of conviction, ſo it is the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way of propagating the ſame throughout the churches of Chriſt: and there being times and ſeaſons wherein their ſpirits are more than at others diſpoſed to have theſe things impreſſed upon them, ſo we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that all parents, and others concerned in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of youth, might wait in the fear of God to know themſelves divinely qualified for that ſervice, that in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0010800104:269"/>his wiſdom they may make uſe of every ſuch opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which the Lord ſhall put into their hands. And we do hereby warn and adviſe friends in all places to flee every appearance of evil, and to avoid pride, and following the vain faſhions and cuſtoms of this world, as recommended in our epiſtle 1715.</p>
                  <p>And as we always found it our concern to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend love, unity, and concord in the churches of Chriſt every where, ſo, as a means to effect the ſame, we earneſtly deſire that friends, but more eſpecially ſuch who are concerned in meetings of buſineſs, do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know their own ſpirits, to be ſubjected by the ſpirit of truth, that thereby, being baptiſed into one body, they may be truly one in the foundation of their love and unity, and that therein they may all labour to find a nearneſs to each other in ſpirit, this being the true way to a thorough reconciliation, where-ever there is or may have been any difference of apprehenſion; thereby friends will be preſerved in that ſweetneſs of ſpirit that is and will be the bond of true peace through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the churches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And, dear friends, the friends of this meeting, to whom the inſpection of the accounts was referred, made report, that having peruſed the ſame, they found the ſtock nearly expended; whereupon this meeting thinks it neceſſary to recommend unto you, that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and free contribution be made in every county, and that what ſhall be thereupon collected be ſent up to the reſpective correſpondents.</p>
                  <p>Finally, dear friends and brethren, be careful to walk unblameable in love and peace among yourſelves, and towards all men in Chriſtian charity; and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thankful to the Lord, our moſt gracious God, for the favour he hath given us in the eyes of the King and civil government, in the peaceable enjoyment of our religious and Chriſtian liberty under them; and the God of peace, we truſt, will be with you to the end.</p>

<note n="*" place="bottom">The canon is, "Whoſoever ſhall hereafter affirm, that the King's Majeſty hath not the ſame authority in cauſes eccleſiaſtical that the godly Kings had amongſt the Jews, and Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the primitive church, or impeach any part of his regal ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in the ſaid cauſes reſtored to the crown, and by the laws of this realm therein eſtabliſhed, let him be excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and not reſtored, but only by the Archbiſhop, after his repentance and public revocation of thoſe his wicked errors."</note>, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, the King therein mentioned is to be underſtood of that perſon who is poſſeſſed of the throne, according to the civil inſtitution of the hereditary Engliſh monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and that whoever diſowns his authority, &amp;c. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs the ſentence of excommunication <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that canon. They inſiſt, that if King James II. had a right, the compliers with the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were by this canon excommunicated; as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving their rightful Sovereign, they diſavowed his authority, &amp;c. King James had a right, they ſay, which he continued to claim till the day of his death; and that his ſon (whoſe right as a ſon they declare to be as unqueſtionable as his father's) has always kept up and aſſerted his claim. So much for their political creed.</p>
               <p>With regard to their eccleſiaſtical tenets, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the neceſſity of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, from the Apoſtles, of thoſe who adminiſter Chriſt's ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: that the deprivation of Biſhops by lay-authority is invalid of itſelf, and ſhould not be acknowledged: that the interpoſition of lay-power has interrupted the ſucceſſion, as to all who ſubmit to, or own their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: that the authority of the church of England, and of conſequence the church of England itſelf, was reſident in the deprived Biſhops and clergy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Non-Jurors, their ſucceſſors, who have immutably adhered to her true conſtitutions and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0010800104:272"/>and that all who depart from them are at leaſt in a ſtate of ſchiſm. To ſupport theſe tenets, they advance, that the canonical metropolitan Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Sancroft was not only diſplaced, but Dr. Tillotſon, a ſubject preſbyter of his, placed in his room; and when God had removed him, another, Dr. Tenniſon, was ſet up in his place as head of the ſchiſm: that under the Biſhops, who actually did this, or thoſe who approve of ſuch doings, by joining in communion with them, in oppoſition to the true canonical Biſhops, have all the parochial clergy acted, and joined with them againſt the canonical deprived Prelates, and their ſucceſſors; and being thus joined with them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſchiſmatics; and that thoſe, tho' canonically or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and placed over a flock, yet by cloſing with ſchiſmatics, have forfeited all the privileges of their function, and cannot diſpenſe the ordinances of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with any benefit.</p>
               <p>The Non-Jurors of Scotland maintain the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with thoſe of England; they both make uſe of the book of Common Prayer in their worſhip; tho' the Scots generally officiate by the communion ſervice in the prayer-book, compoſed for their country in the reign of King Charles I.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hicks, Dr. Kettlewell, the Rev. Mr. John Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and others their champions, have written learned treatiſes, in defence of their principles; and the Non-Jurors aver that the above, with Dr. Charles Leſlie

               <p>COntrary to my uſual method, I think proper to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the principles of this popular ſect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give an account of their riſe and progreſs; and, firſt, I ſhall lay before my readers <hi>the character of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt,</hi> as drawn by the Rev. Mr. John Weſley, who, tho' he may differ in a few points from the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, the founder of Methodiſm, yet ſpeaks, in moſt things, the ſenſe of the whole body
<note n="†" place="bottom">He introduces it, by ſaying, he does "now give the cleareſt account <hi>he</hi> can, <hi>in the preſence of the Lord and judge of heaven and earth,</hi> of the principles and practices, whereby thoſe who are called <hi>Methodiſts</hi> are diſtinguiſhed from other men."</note>.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0010800104:274"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The diſtinguiſhing marks of a Methodiſt are not his opinions of any ſort. His aſſenting to this or that ſcheme of religion, his embracing any particular ſet of notions, his eſpouſing the judgment of one man or of another, are all quite wide of the point. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore imagines, that a Methodiſt is, a man of ſuch or ſuch an opinion, is groſly ignorant of the whole affair: he miſtakes the truth totally. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve indeed, that all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God; and herein we are diſtinguiſhed from Jews, Turks, and Infidels. We believe the written word of God to be the only and ſufficient rule, both of Chriſtian faith and practice; and herein we are fundamentally diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the Romiſh church. We believe Chriſt to be the eternal ſupreme God; and herein are we diſtinguiſhed from the Socinians and Arians. But as to all opinions which do not ſtrike at the root of Chriſtianity, we think and let think. So that whatſoever they are, whether right or wrong, they are no diſtinguiſhing marks of a Methodiſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither are words or phraſes of any ſort. We do not place our religion, or any part of it, in being attached to any peculiar mode of ſpeaking, any quaint or uncommon ſet of expreſſions. The moſt obvious, eaſy, common words, wherein our meaning can be conveyed, we prefer before others, both on ordinary occaſions, and when we ſpeak of the things of God. We never therefore willingly or deſignedly deviate from the moſt uſual way of ſpeaking; unleſs when we expreſs ſcripture truths in ſcripture words (which we preſume no Chriſtian will condemn.) Neither do we affect to uſe any particular expreſſions of ſcripture, more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than others, unleſs they are ſuch as are more frequently uſed by the inſpired writers themſelves. So that it is as groſs an error, to place the marks of a Methodiſt in his words, as in opinions of any ſort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor do we deſire to be diſtinguiſhed by actions, cuſtoms, or uſages, of an indifferent nature. Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0010800104:275"/>does not lie in doing what God hath not enjoined, or abſtaining from what he hath not forbidden. It does not lie in the form of our apparel, in the poſture of our body, or the covering of our heads; nor yet in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from marriage, nor from meats and drinks, which are all good if received with thankſgiving. Therefore neither will any man who knows whereof he affirms, fix the mark of a Methodiſt here; in any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or cuſtoms purely indifferent, undertermined by the word of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor, laſtly, is he to be diſtinguiſhed by laying the whole ſtreſs of religion on any ſingle part of it. If you ſay, "Yes, he is; for he thinks we are ſaved by faith alone:" I anſwer, you do not underſtand the terms. By ſalvation he means, holineſs of heart and life. And this he affirms to ſpring from true faith alone. Can even a nominal Chriſtian deny it? Is this placing a part of religion for the whole? Do we then make void the law thro' faith? God forbid! Yea we eſtabliſh the law. We do not place the whole of religion (as too many do, God knoweth) either in doing no harm, or in doing good, or in uſing the ordinances of God: No, nor in all of them together; wherein we know, by experience, a man may labour many years, and at the end have no true religion at all, no more than he had at the beginning. Much leſs in any one of theſe; or, it may be in a ſcrap of one of them: like her who fancies herſelf a virtuous woman, only becauſe ſhe is not a proſtitute; or him who dreams he is an honeſt man, merely becauſe he does not rob or ſteal. May the Lord God of my fathers preſerve me from ſuch a poor, ſtarved religion as this! Were this the mark of a Methodiſt, I would ſooner chuſe to be a ſincere Jew, Turk, or Pagan.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What then is the mark? Who is a Methodiſt according to your own account? I anſwer: A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt is one, who has the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart, by the Holy Ghoſt given unto him: one
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0010800104:276"/>who loves the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his mind, and with all his ſtrength. God is the joy of his heart, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his ſoul; which is conſtantly crying out, "Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſide thee! My God and my all! thou art the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever!"</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is therefore happy in God, yea always happy, as having in him a well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life, and overflowing his ſoul with peace and joy. Perfect love having now caſt out fear, he rejoices evermore. He rejoices in the Lord always, even in God his Saviour: and in the Father, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom he hath now received the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Having found redemption thro' his blood, the forgivenneſs of his ſins, he cannot but rejoice, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he looks back on the horrible pit out of which he is delivered, when he ſees all his tranſgreſſions blotted out as a cloud, and his iniquities as a thick cloud. He cannot but rejoice, whenever he looks on the ſtate wherein he now is, being juſtified freely, and having peace with God, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For he that believeth hath the witneſs of this in himſelf: being now the Son of God by faith; becauſe he is a Son, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into his heart, crying out, Abba, Father! And the Spirit itſelf bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſs with his ſpirit, that he is a child of God. He rejoiceth alſo, whenever he looks forward in hope of the glory that ſhall be revealed: yea, this his joy is full, and all his bones cry out, Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten me again to a living hope—of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for me.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And he who hath this hope thus full of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in every thing giveth thanks; as knowing that this (whatſoever it is) is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0010800104:277"/>concerning him. From him therefore he chearfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all, ſaying, Good is the will of the Lord; and whether the Lord giveth or taketh away, equally bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the name of the Lord. For he hath learned in whatſoever ſtare he is, therewith to be content. He knoweth both how to be abaſed, and how to abound. Every where and in all things he is inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need. Whether in eaſe or pain, whether in ſickneſs or health, whether in life or death, he giveth thanks from the ground of the heart to him who orders it for good: knowing that as every good gift cometh from above, ſo none but good can come from the Father of Light, into whoſe hands he has wholly committed his body and ſoul, as into the hands of a faithful Creator. He is therefore careful (anxiouſly or uneaſily careful) for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; as having caſt all his care on him that careth for him, and in all things reſting on him, after making his requeſt known to him with thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For indeed he prays without ceaſing. It is given him always to pray and not to faint. Not that he is always in the houſe of prayer; tho' he neglects no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being there. Neither is he always on his knees, altho' he often is, or on his face, before the Lord his God. Nor yet is he always crying aloud to God, or calling upon him in words. For many times the Spirit maketh interceſſion for him with groans that cannot be uttered: but at all times the language of his heart is this, "Thou brightneſs of the eternal glory, unto thee is my mouth, tho' without a voice, and my ſilence ſpeaketh unto thee." And this is true prayer, —the lifting up the heart to God. This is the eſſence of prayer, and this alone. But his heart is ever lifted up to God, at all times and in all places. In this he is never hindered, much leſs interrupted by any perſon or thing. In retirement, or company, in leiſure, buſineſs or converſation, his heart is ever with the Lord. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he lie down or riſe up, God is in all his thoughts;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0010800104:278"/>he walks with God continually, having the loving eye of his mind ſtill fixed upon him, and every where ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that is inviſible.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And while he thus always exerciſes his love to God, by praying without ceaſing, rejoicing evermore, and in every thing giving thanks, this commandment is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, that he who loveth God, loves his brother alſo. And he accordingly loves his neighbour as himſelf; he loves every man as his own ſoul. His heart is full of love to all mankind, to every child of the Father of the ſpirits of all fleſh. That a man is not perſonally known to him, is no bar to his love: no, nor that he is known to be ſuch as he approves not, that he repays hatred for his good-will; for he loves his enemies, yea and the enemies of God, the evil and the unthankful: and if it be not in his power to do good to them that hate him, yet he ceaſes not to pray for them, though they continue to ſpurn his love, and ſtill deſpitefully uſe him and perſecute him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For he is pure in heart. The love of God has purified his heart from all revengeful paſſions, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, malice, and wrath, from every unkind temper or malign affection. It hath cleanſed him from pride and haughtineſs of ſpirit, whereof alone cometh contention; and he hath now put on bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long ſuffering: ſo that he forbears and forgives, if he had a quarrel againſt any, even as God in Chriſt hath forgiven him. And indeed all poſſible ground for contention, on his part, is utterly cut off; for none can take from him what he deſires, ſeeing he loves not the world, nor any of the things of the world, being now crucified to the world, and the world crucified to him; being dead to all that is in the world, both to the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life; for all his deſire is unto God, and to the remembrance of his name.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Agreeable to this his one deſire, is the one deſire of his life, namely, not to do his own will, but the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0010800104:279"/>will of him that ſent him. His one intention at all times, and in all things, is, not to pleaſe himſelf, but him whom his ſoul loveth. He has a ſingle eye; and becauſe his eye is ſingle, his whole body is full of light. Indeed, where the loving eye of the ſoul is continually fixed upon God, there can be no darkneſs at all, but the whole is light, as when the bright ſhining of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle doth enlighten the houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God then reigns alone. All that is in the ſoul is holineſs to the Lord. There is not a motion in his heart but is according to his will. Every thought that ariſes points to him, and is in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And the tree is known by its fruits; for as he loves God, ſo he keeps his commandments; not only ſome, or moſt of them, but all, from the leaſt to the greateſt. He is not content to keep the whole law, and offend in one point, but has in all points a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence towards God and towards man. Whatever God has forbidden, he avoids; whatever God hath enjoined, he doth; and that whether it be little or great, hard or eaſy, joyous or grievous to the fleſh. He runs the ways of God's commandments, now he hath ſet his heart at liberty. It is his glory ſo to do; it is his daily crown of rejoicing, to do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven; knowing it is the higheſt privilege of the angels of God, of thoſe that excel in ſtrength, to fulfil his commandments, and hearken to the voice of his word.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. All the commandments of God he accordingly keeps, and that with all his might; for his obedience is in proportion to his love, the ſource from whence it flows; and therefore, loving God with all his heart, he ſerves him with all his ſtrength. He continually preſents his ſoul and body a living ſacrifice, holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; entirely and without reſerve devoting himſelf, all he has, and all he is, to his glory. All the talents he has received he conſtantly employs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Maſter's will; every power and faculty
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0010800104:280"/>of his ſoul, every member of his body. Once he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto ſin and the devil, as inſtruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs: but now, being alive from the dead, he yields them all, as inſtruments of righteouſneſs, unto God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. By conſequence, whatſoever he doth, it is all to the glory of God. In all his employments of every kind, he not only aims at this (which is implied in having a ſingle eye) but actually attains it. His bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and refreſhments, as well as his prayers, all ſerve to this great end. Whether he ſit in his houſe or walk by the way, whether he lie down or riſe up, he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting in all he ſpeaks or does, the one buſineſs of his life: whether he put on his apparel, or labour, or eat and drink, or divert himſelf from too waſting labour, it all tends to advance the glory of God, by peace and good-will among men. His one invariable rule is this, Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Nor do the cuſtoms of the world at all hinder his running the race that is ſet before him. He knows that vice does not loſe its nature, though it becomes ever ſo faſhionable; and remembers, that every man is to give an account of himſelf to God. He cannot, therefore, even follow a multitude to do evil. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fare ſumptuouſly every day, or make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof. He cannot lay up treaſures upon earth, no more than he can take fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſom. He cannot adorn himſelf (on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) with gold or coſtly apparel; he cannot join in, or countenance any diverſion which has the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to vice of any kind. He cannot ſpeak evil of his neighbour, no more than he can lie, either for God or man. He cannot utter an unkind word of any one; for love-keeps the door of his lips. He cannot ſpeak idle words: no corrupt communication ever comes out of his mouth, as is all that which is not good, to the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0010800104:281"/>uſe of edifying, not fit to miniſter grace to the hearers. But whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are juſtly of good report, he thinks, and ſpeaks, and acts, adorning the doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all things.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Laſtly, as he has time, he does good unto all men; unto neighbours and ſtrangers, friends and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and that in every poſſible kind; not only to their bodies, by feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked, viſiting thoſe that are ſick or in priſon; but much more does he labour to do good to their ſouls, as of the ability which God giveth: to awaken thoſe that ſleep in death; to bring thoſe who are awakened to the atoning blood, that, being juſtified by faith, they may have peace with God, and to provoke thoſe who have peace with God to abound more in love and in good works; and he is willing to ſpend and be ſpent herein, even to be offered up on the ſacrifice and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their faith, ſo they may all come unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Theſe are the principles and practices of our ſect, theſe are the marks of a true Methodiſt. By theſe alone do thoſe who are in deriſion ſo called, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſtinguiſhed from other men. If any man ſay, "Why theſe are only the common, fundamental principles of Chriſtianity!" Thou haſt ſaid: ſo I mean; this is the very truth; I know they are no other; and I would to God both thou and all men knew, that I, and all who follow my judgment, do vehemently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be diſtinguiſhed from other men, by any but the common principles of Chriſtianity. The plain, old Chriſtianity that I teach, renouncing and deteſting all other m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rks of diſtinction; and whoſoever is what I preach (let him be called what he will, for names change not the nature of things) he is a Chriſtian, not in name only, but in heart and in life. He is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly conformed to the will of God, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the written word. He thinks, ſpeaks, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0010800104:282"/>lives according to the method laid down in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt. His ſoul is renewed after the image of God, in righteouſneſs and in all true holineſs; and having the mind that was in Chriſt, he ſo walks as Chriſt alſo walked.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. By theſe marks, by theſe fruits of a living faith do we labour to diſtinguiſh ourſelves from the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving world, from all thoſe whoſe minds or lives are not according to the goſpel of Chriſt. But from real Chriſtians, of whatſoever denomination they be, we earneſtly deſire not to be diſtinguiſhed at all; not from any who ſincerely follow after what they know they have not yet attained. No: whoſoever doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, the ſame is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſiſter, and mother: and I beſeech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by the mercies of God, that we be in no wiſe divided among ourſelves. Is thy heart right, as my hart is with thine? I aſk no farther queſtion. If it be, give me thy hand. For opinions, or terms, let us not deſtroy the work of God. Doſt thou love and ſerve God? it is enough. I give thee the right-hand of fellowſhip. If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, let us ſtrive together for the faith of the goſpel, walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called, with all lowlineſs and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace; remembering there is one body and one ſpirit, even as we are called with one hope of our calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all!</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>I believe juſtification by faith alone; for I am firmly perſuaded, that every man of the offspring of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0010800104:283"/>Adam is very far gone from original righteouſneſs, and is of his own nature inclined to evil: that this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature, in every perſon born into the world, deſerves God's wrath and damnation: that therefore, if ever we receive the remiſſion of our ſins, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous before God, it muſt be only for the merits of Chriſt, by faith, and not for our own works or deſervings of any kind. Nay, I am perſuaded, that all works done before juſtification have in them the nature of ſin; and that conſequently, till he is juſtified, a man has no power to do any work which is pleaſing and acceptable to God.</p>
                     <p>I believe three things muſt go together in our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; upon God's part, his great mercy and grace; upon Chriſt's part, the ſatisfaction of God's juſtice, by the offering his body, and ſhedding his blood, and fulfilling the law of God perfectly; and upon our part, true and living faith in the merits of Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that in our juſtification there is not only God's mercy and grace, but his juſtice alſo: and ſo the grace of God does not ſhut out the righteouſneſs of God in our juſtification, but only ſhuts out the righteouſneſs of man, that is, the righteouſneſs of our works; and therefore St. Paul requires nothing on the part of man, but only a true and living faith. Yet this faith does not ſhut out repentance, hope, and love, which are joined with faith in every man that is juſtified; but it ſhuts them out from the office of juſtifying; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are all preſent together in him that is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet they juſtify not all together. Neither does faith ſhut out good works, neceſſarily to be done after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but we may not do them to this intent, to be juſtified by doing them. Our juſtification comes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the mere mercy of God: for whereas all the world was not able to pay any part towards their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, it pleaſed him, without any of our deſerving, to prepare for us Chriſt's body and blood, whereby our ranſom might be paid, his law fulfilled, and his juſtice
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0010800104:284"/>ſatisfied. Chriſt therefore is now the righteouſneſs of all them that truly believe in him. He for them paid the ranſom by his death. He for them fulfilled the law in his life. So that now in him, and by him, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry believer may be called a fulfiller of the law.</p>
                     <p>But let it be obſerved, the true ſenſe of thoſe words, "we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt only," is not, that this our own act, to believe in Chriſt, or this our faith which is within us, juſtifies us (for that were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ourſelves to be juſtified by ſome act or virtue that is within us): but that altho' we have faith, hope, and love within us, and do never ſo many good works, yet we muſt renounce the merit of all, of faith, hope, love, and all other virtues and good works, which we either have done, ſhall do, or can do, as far too weak to deſerve our juſtification: for which therefore we muſt truſt only in God's mercy, and the merits of Chriſt. For it is he alone that taketh away our ſins. To him alone are we to go for this; ſorſaking all our virtues, good words, thoughts, and works, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our truſt in Chriſt only. In ſtrictneſs therefore, neither our faith nor our works juſtify us, <hi>i. e.</hi> deſerve the remiſſion of our ſins: but God himſelf juſtifies us, of his own mercy, through the merits of his Son only. Nevertheleſs, becauſe by faith we embrace the promiſe of God's mercy, and of the remiſſion of our ſins, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſcripture ſays, that faith does juſtify, yea, faith without works. And as it is all one to ſay, faith without works, and faith alone juſtifies us, therefore the antient fathers from time to time ſpeak thus; Faith alone juſtifies us. And becauſe we receive faith thro' the only merits of Chriſt, and not thro' the merit of any virtue we have, or work we do; therefore in that reſpect we renounce, as it were, again, faith, works, and all other virtues. For our corruption thro' original ſin is ſo great, that all our faith, charity, words, and works, cannot merit or deſerve any part of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for us: and therefore we thus ſpeak, humbling
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0010800104:285"/>ourſelves before God, and giving Chriſt all the glory of our juſtification. But it ſhould alſo be obſerved, what that faith is, whereby we are juſtified. Now that faith which brings not forth good works, is not a living faith, but a dead and deviliſh one. For even the devils believe, "That Chriſt was born of a virgin, that he wrought all kind of miracles, declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be very God; that for our ſakes he died and roſe again, and aſcended into heaven, and at the end of the world ſhall come again, to judge the quick and the dead." This the devils believe, and ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that is written in the Old and New Teſtament; and yet ſtill, for all this faith, they are but devils. They remain ſtill in their damnable eſtate, lacking the true Chriſtian faith. The true Chriſtian faith is, not only to believe the holy ſcriptures and articles of our faith are true, but alſo to have a ſure truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be ſaved from everlaſting damnation by Chriſt, whereof doth follow a loving heart, to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And this faith neither any devil hath, nor any wicked man. No ungodly man hath or can have this ſure truſt and confidence in God, that by the merits of Chriſt his ſins are forgiven, and be reconciled to the favour of God.</p>

                     <hi>Of</hi> CHRISTIAN PERFECTION.</head>
                  <q>
                     <p>Perhaps the general prejudice againſt Chriſtian perfection may chiefly ariſe from a miſapprehenſion of the nature of it. We willingly allow, and continually declare, there is no ſuch perfection, in this life, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a diſpenſation from doing good, and attending all the ordinances of God; or a freedom from ignorance, miſtake, temptation, and a thouſand infirmities neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily connected with fleſh and blood. Firſt, we not only allow, but earneſtly contend (as for the faith once delivered to the ſaints) that there is no ſuch perfection in this life, as implies any diſpenſation from attending
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0010800104:286"/>all the ordinances of God, or from doing good unto all men while we have time, tho' eſpecially unto the houſhold of faith. And whoſoever they are who have taught otherwiſe, we are convinced are not taught of God. We dare not receive them, neither bid them God ſpeed, leſt we be partakers of their evil deeds. We believe that not only the babes in Chriſt, who have newly found redemption in his blood, but thoſe alſo, who are grown up unto perfect men, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly obliged (and that they are obliged thereto is their glory and crown of rejoicing) as oft as they have opportunity to eat bread and drink wine, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him; to ſearch the ſcriptures; by faſting (as well as temperance) to keep their bodies under, and bring them into ſubjection; and above all, to pour out their ſouls in prayer, both ſecretly, and in the great congregation. We ſecondly believe, and therefore ſpeak, and that unto all men, and with much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that there is no ſuch perfection in this life, as implies an entire deliverance, either from ignorance or miſtake in things not eſſential to ſalvation, or from manifold temptations, or from numberleſs infirmities, wherewith the corruptible body, more or leſs, preſſes down the ſoul. This is the ſame thing which we have ſpoken from the beginning; if any teach otherwiſe, they are not of us. We cannot find any ground in ſcripture to ſuppoſe, that any inhabitant of an houſe of clay is wholly exempt either from bodily infirmities, or from ignorance of many things; or to imagine any mere man is incapable of miſtake, or of falling into divers temptations: No; the diſciple is not above his maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord. It is enough that every one who is perfect ſhall be as his maſter. But what then, it may be aſked, do you mean by one that is perfect, or one that is as his maſter? We mean, one in whom is the mind which was in Chriſt, and who ſo walketh as he alſo walked; a man that hath
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0010800104:287"/>clean hands and a pure heart; or that is cleanſed from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit: one in whom there is no occaſion of ſtumbling, and who accordingly doth not commit ſin. To declare this a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, we underſtand by that ſcriptural expreſſion a <hi>perfect man,</hi> one in whom God hath fulfilled his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful word, "From all your filthineſs and from all your idols will I cleanſe you.—I will alſo ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes." We underſtand hereby, one whom God hath ſanctified throughout, even in body, ſoul, and ſpirit: one who walketh in the light, as he is in the light, in whom is no darkneſs at all; the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son having cleanſed him from all ſin. This man can now teſtify to all mankind, I am crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me. He is holy, as God who hath called him is holy, both in heart and in all manner of converſation. He loveth the Lord his God with all his heart, and ſerveth him with all his ſtrength. He loveth his neighbour (every man) as himſelf; yea, as Chriſt loved us: them in particular that deſpitefully uſe him and perſecute him, becauſe they know not the Son, neither the Father. Indeed his ſoul is all love, filled with bowels of mercies, kindneſs, meekneſs, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, long ſuffering. And his life agreeth thereto, full of the work of faith, the patience of hope, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love: and whatſoever he doth either in word or deed, he doth it all in the name, in the love and power of the Lord Jeſus. In a word, he doth the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven. This it is to be a perfect man, to be ſanctified throughout, created anew in Chriſt Jeſus: even to have a heart ſo all-flaming with the love of God (to uſe Archbiſhop Uſher's words) as continually to offer up every thought, word, and work, as a ſpiritual ſacrifice, acceptable unto God thro' Chriſt. In every thought of our hearts, in every word of our tongues, in every work of our hands, to ſhew forth his praiſe, who hath called us out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0010800104:288"/>into his marvellous light! O that both we, and all who ſeek the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, may thus be made perfect in one!</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>If there be any-thing unſcriptural in theſe words, any-thing wild or extravagant, any-thing contrary to the analogy of faith, or the experience of adult Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, let them ſmite me friendly and reprove me; let them impart to me of the clearer light God has given them. How knoweſt thou, O man, but thou mayeſt gain thy brother? but he may at length come to the knowledge of the truth? and thy labour of love, ſhewn forth with meekneſs of wiſdom, may not be in vain?</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>I believe that converſion (meaning thereby juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) is an inſtantaneous work; and the moment a man has living faith in Chriſt, he is converted or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: which faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e cannot have, without knowing that he has it.</p>
                     <p>I believe the moment a man is juſtified he has peace with God: which he cannot have, without knowing that he has it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſenſe of forgiveneſs is often mixed with doubt or fear: but the full aſſurance of faith excludes all doubt and fear, as the very term implies.</p>
                     <p>I believe to be juſtified is the ſame as to be born of God; and he that is born of God ſinneth not. Which deliverance from ſin he cannot have, without knowing that he has it.</p>

                     <p>I believe every man is penitent before he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; he repents, before he believes the goſpel. But it is never before, and generally long after he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0010800104:289"/>that Chriſt is formed in him; and that this peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and contrition is the work of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet I believe that all this is nothing towards, and has no influence on our juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Again, I believe that in order to obtain juſtification I muſt go ſtrait to Chriſt, with all my ungodlineſs, and plead nothing elſe.</p>

                     <p>A man may have a weak faith, at the ſame time that he has peace with God, and no unholy deſires.</p>
                     <p>A man may be juſtified, who has not a clean heart, neither the indwelling of the ſpirit.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To ſum up the whole, Mr. Weſley deſires not a more conſiſtent account of his principles than the following words:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Our ſpiritual ſtate ſhould be conſidered, and diſtinctly, under each of theſe views.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Before juſtification; in which ſtate we may be ſaid to be unable to do any-thing acceptable to God: becauſe then we can do nothing but come to Chriſt; which ought not to be conſidered as doing any-thing, but as ſupplicating (or waiting) to receive a power of doing for the time to come. For the preventing grace of God, which is common to all, is ſufficient to bring us to Chriſt, though it is not ſufficient to carry us any farther, till we are juſtified.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0010800104:290"/>2. After juſtification. The moment a man comes to Chriſt (by faith) he is juſtified, and born again; that is, he is born again in the imperfect ſenſe (for there are two [if not more] degrees of regeneration); and he has power over all the ſtirrings and motions of ſin, but not a total freedom from them. He has Chriſt with him, but not Chriſt in him. Therefore he hath not yet, in the full and proper ſenſe, a new and clean heart, or the indwelling of the ſpirit. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to various temptations, he may, and will fall again from this condition, if he doth not attain to a more excellent gift.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sanctification; the laſt and higheſt ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this life. For then are the faithful born again in the full and perfect ſenſe. Then have they the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the ſpirit. Then is there given unto them a new and clean heart, and the ſtruggle between the old and new man is over.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Mr. Weſley, in <hi>An earneſt Appeal to Men of Reaſon and Religion,</hi> thus further expreſſes himſelf in regard to the principles of the Methodiſts:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Although it is with us a very ſmall thing to be judged of you or of man's judgment, ſeeing we know God will make our innocency as clear as the light, and our juſt dealing as the noon-day; yet are we ready to give any that are willing to hear, a plain account both of our principles and actions; as having renounced the hidden things of ſhame, and deſiring nothing more, than by manifeſtation of the truth to commend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>We ſee (and who does not) the numberleſs follies and miſeries of our fellow-creatures. We ſee on every ſide, either men of no religion at all, or men of a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, formal religion. We are grieved at the ſight, and ſhould greatly rejoice, if by any means we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſome, that there is a better religion to be attained, a religion worthy of God that gave it. And this we
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0010800104:291"/>conceive to be no other than love; the love of God and of all mankind; the loving God with all our heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength, as having firſt loved us, as the fountain of all the good we have received, and of all we ever hope to enjoy; and the loving every ſoul which God hath made, every man on earth, as our own ſoul.</p>
                     <p>This love we believe to be the medicine of life, the never-failing remedy, for all the evils of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered world, for all the miſeries and vices of men. Wherever this is, there are virtue and happineſs, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand-in-hand. There is humbleneſs of mind, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, long-ſuffering, the whole image of God, and at the ſame time a peace that paſſeth all underſtanding, and joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
                     <p>This religion we long to ſee eſtabliſhed in the world, a religion of love and joy and peace, having its ſeat in the heart, in the inmoſt ſoul, but ever ſhewing itſelf, by its fruits, continually ſpringing forth not only in all innocence (for love worketh no ill to his neighbour) but likewiſe in every kind of beneficence, ſpreading virtue and happineſs all around it.</p>
                     <p>This religion have we been following after for many years, as many know if they would teſtify: but all this time, ſeeking wiſdom we found it not; we were ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſtrength in vain. And being now under full conviction of this, we declare it to all mankind: for we deſire not that others ſhould wander out of the way, as we have done before them; but rather that they may profit by our loſs, that they may go (tho' we did not, having then no man to guide us) the ſtreight way to the religion of love, even by faith.</p>
                     <p>Now faith, ſuppoſing the ſcripture to be of God, is the demonſtrative evidence of things unſeen, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural evidence of things inviſible, not perceivable by eyes of fleſh, or by any of our natural ſenſes or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Faith is that divine evidence, whereby the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man diſcerneth God and the things of God. It is with regard to the ſpiritual world, what ſenſe is with
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0010800104:292"/>regard to the natural. It is the ſpiritual ſenſation of every ſoul that is born of God.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you have not conſidered it in this view; I will then explain it a little further.</p>
                     <p>Faith, according to the ſcriptural account, is the eye of the new born ſoul. Hereby every true believer in God ſeeth him who is inviſible. Hereby (in a more particular manner ſince life and immortality have been brought to light by the goſpel) he ſeeth the light of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; and, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what manner of love it is, which the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we (who are born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) ſhould be called the ſons of God.</p>
                     <p>It is the ear of the ſoul, whereby a ſinner hears the voice of the Son of God and lives; even that voice which alone wakes the dead, Son, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</p>
                     <p>It is (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) the palate of the ſoul: for hereby a believer taſtes the good word, and the powers of the world to come; and hereby he both taſtes and ſees that God is gracious, yea, and merciful to him a ſinner.</p>
                     <p>It is the feeling of the ſoul, whereby a believer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, thro' the power of the Higheſt overſhadowing him, both the exiſtence and the preſence of him, in whom he lives, moves, and has his being; and indeed the whole inviſible world, the entire ſyſtem of things eternal. And hereby, in particular, he feels the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart.</p>
                     <p>By this faith we are ſaved from all uneaſineſs of mind, from the anguiſh of a wounded ſpirit, from diſcontent, from fear, and ſorrow of heart, and from that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible liſtleſsneſs and wearineſs, both of the world and of ourſelves, which we had ſo helpleſly laboured under for many years; eſpecially when we were out of the hurry of the world, and ſunk into calm reflection. In this we find that love of God, and of all mankind, which we had elſewhere ſought in vain. This we know
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0010800104:293"/>and feel, and therefore cannot but declare ſaves every one that partakes of it, both from ſin and miſery, from every unhappy and every unholy temper.</p>
                     <p>If you aſk, "Why then have not all men this faith? all at leaſt who conceive it to be ſo happy a thing? why do they not believe immediately?"</p>
                     <p>We anſwer (on the ſcripture-hypotheſis) It is the gift of God. No man is able to work it in himſelf. It is a work of Omnipotence. It requires no leſs power thus to quicken a dead ſoul, than to raiſe a body that lies in the grave. It is a new creation; and none can create a ſoul anew but he who at firſt created the heavens and the earth.</p>
                     <p>May not your own experience teach you this? Can you give yourſelf this faith? Is it now in your power to ſee, or hear, or taſte, or feel God? Have you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, or can you raiſe in yourſelf, any perception of God, or of an inviſible world? I ſuppoſe you do not deny that there is an inviſible world: you will not charge it in poor old Heſiod, to Chriſtian prejudice of education, when he ſays, in thoſe well-known words,
<q>
                           <l>Millions of ſpiritual creatures walk the earth</l>
                           <l>Unſeen, whether we wake, or if we ſleep.</l>
                        </q> Now, is there any power in your ſoul, whereby you diſcern either theſe, or him that created them? Or, can all your wiſdom and ſtrength open an intercourſe between yourſelf and the world of ſpirits? Is it in your power to burſt the veil that is on your heart, and let in the light of eternity? You know it is not. You not only do not, but cannot (by your own ſtrength) thus believe. The more you labour ſo to do, the more you will be convinced, it is the gift of God.</p>
                     <p>It is the free gift of God, which he beſtows not on thoſe who are worthy of his favour, not on ſuch as are previouſly holy, and ſo fit to be crowned with all the bleſſings of his goodneſs; but on the ungodly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy; on thoſe who, till that hour, were fit only for everlaſting deſtruction; thoſe in whom was no good
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0010800104:294"/>thing, and whoſe only plea was, God be merciful to me a ſinner. No merit, no goodneſs in man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the forgiving love of God. His pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſuppoſes nothing in us but a ſenſe of mere ſin and miſery: and to all who ſee, and feel, and own their wants, and their utter inability to remove them, God freely gives faith, for the ſake of him in whom he is always well pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>This is a ſhort rude ſketch of the doctrine we teach. Theſe are our fundamental principles; and we ſpend our lives in confirming others herein, and in a beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſuitable to them.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>After a great deal of ſhrewd and pertinent reaſoning, he goes on to vindicate theſe doctrines in a manner pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himſelf.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Perhaps the firſt thing that now occurs to your mind relates to the doctrine which we teach. You have heard that we ſay, "Men may live without ſin;" and have you not heard, that the ſcripture ſays the ſame (we mean, without committing ſin)? Does not St. Paul ſay plainly, that thoſe who believe do not continue in?—that they cannot live any longer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 1, 2. Does not St. Peter ſay, He that hath ſuffered in the fleſh hath ceaſed from ſin?—that he no longer ſhould live—to the deſires of men, but to the will of God? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 1, 2. And does not St. John ſay moſt expreſsly, He that committeth ſin is of the devil?—For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſt, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil. Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, becauſe he is born of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 8, &amp;c. And again, We know that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not, ch. v. 18.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, then, it is not we that ſay this, but the Lord. Theſe are not our words, but his. And who is he that replieth againſt God? Who is able to make God a liar? Surely he will be juſtified in his ſaying,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0010800104:295"/>and cleared when he is judged! Can you deny it? Have you not often felt a ſecret check, when you was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting this great truth? And how often have you wiſhed what you was taught to deny? Nay, can you help wiſhing for it at this moment? Do you not now earneſtly deſire to ceaſe from ſin? to commit it no more? Does not your ſoul pant after this glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſons of God? And what ſtrong reaſon have you to expect it? Have you not had a foretaſte of it already? Do you not remember the time when God firſt lifted up the light of his countenance upon you? Can it ever be forgotten? the day when the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord firſt ſhone upon your head? You then had power not to commit ſin. You found the Apoſtle's words ſtrictly true, He that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not. But thoſe whom you took to be experienced Chriſtians, telling you, "this was the only time of your eſpouſals; this could not laſt always; you muſt come down the mount," and the like, ſhook your faith. You looked at men more than God, and ſo became weak, and like another man; whereas, had you then had any to guide you according to the truth of God, had you then heard the doctrine which now you blame, you had never fallen from your ſtedfaſtneſs; but had found, that in this ſenſe alſo the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
                     <p>Have you not another objection nearly allied to this, namely, that we preach perfection? True; but what perfection? The term you cannot object to, becauſe it is ſcriptural. All the difficulty is, to fix the meaning of it, according to the word of God: and this we have done again and again, declaring to all the world, that Chriſtian perfection does not imply an exemption from ignorance or miſtake, or infirmities, or temptations; but that it does imply, the being ſo crucified with Chriſt, as to be able to teſtify, I live not, but Chriſt liveth in me (<hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 23.), and hath purified my heart
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0010800104:296"/>by faith (<hi>Acts</hi> xv. 9.). It does imply the caſting down every high thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt. It does imply the being holy, as he that hath called us is holy in all manner of converſation (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 15.); and, in a word, the loving the Lord our God with all our heart, and ſerving him with all our ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Now, is it poſſible for any one who believes the ſcripture to deny one tittle of this? You cannot; you dare not; you would not for the world; you know it is the pure word of God: and this is the whole of what we preach; this is the height and depth of what we (with St. Paul) call perfection; a ſtate of ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to be wiſhed, by all who have taſted of the love of God. O pray for it without ceaſing; it is the one thing you want. Come with boldneſs to the throne of grace, and be aſſured, that when you aſk this of God, you ſhall have the petition you aſk of him. We know indeed, that to man, to the natural man, this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; but we know alſo, that as no work is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with God, ſo all things are poſſible to him that believeth.</p>
                     <p>For we are ſaved by faith. But have you not heard this urged as another objection againſt us, That we preach ſalvation by faith alone? And does not St. Paul do the ſame thing? By grace, ſaith he, ye are ſaved through faith. Can any words be more expreſs? And elſewhere, Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 31.</p>
                     <p>What we mean by this (if it has not been ſufficiently explained already) is, that we are ſaved from our ſins, only by a confidence in the love of God. As ſoon as we behold what manner of love it is which the Father has beſtowed upon us, we love him (as the Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) becauſe he firſt loved us; and then is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment written in our heart, that he who loveth God love his brother alſo; from which love of God
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0010800104:297"/>and man, meekneſs, humbleneſs of mind, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempers, ſpring. Now theſe are the very eſſence of ſalvation, of Chriſtian ſalvation, ſalvation from ſin; and from theſe outward ſalvation flows, that is, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of life and converſation. Well, and are not theſe things ſo? If you know in whom you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, you need no further witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps you doubt, whether that faith whereby we are thus ſaved, implies ſuch a truſt and confidence in God as we deſcribe. "You cannot think faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies aſſurance; an aſſurance of the love of God to our ſouls, of his being now reconciled to us, and having forgiven all our ſins." And this we freely confeſs, that if number of voices is to decide the queſtion, we muſt give it up at once; for you have on your ſide, not only ſome who deſire to be Chriſtians in deed, but all nominal Chriſtians in every place, and the Romiſh church, one and all. Nay, theſe laſt are ſo vehement in your defence, that, in the famed council of Trent, they have decreed, "If any man hold <hi>(fiduciam)</hi> truſt, confidence, or aſſurance of pardon, to be eſſential to faith, let him be accurſed."</p>
                     <p>Thus does that council anathematiſe the church of England; for ſhe is convict hereof, by her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The very words in the homily on ſalvation are, "Even the devils believe, that Chriſt was born of a virgin; that he wrought all kind of miracles, declaring himſelf very God; that for our ſakes he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a moſt painful death, to redeem us from death everlaſting. Theſe articles of our faith the devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and ſo they believe all that was written in the Old and New Teſtament; and yet, for all this faith, they be but devils. They remain ſtill in their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate, lacking the very true Chriſtian faith."</p>
                     <p>The right and true Chriſtian faith is, not only to believe the holy ſcriptures and the articles of our faith are true, but alſo to have a ſure truſt and confidence to be ſaved from everlaſting damnation through Chriſt;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0010800104:298"/>or (as it is expreſſed a little after) "a ſure truſt and confidence which a man hath in God, that by the merits of Chriſt his ſins are forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God."</p>
                     <p>Indeed the Biſhop of Rome ſaith, "If any man hold this, let him be an Anathema Maran-atha." But it is to be hoped Papal anathemas do not move you. You are a member of the church of England. Are you? Then the controverſy is at an end. Then hear the church. Faith is a ſure truſt which a man hath in God, that his ſins are forgiven. Or if you are not, whether you hear our church or no, at leaſt, hear the ſcriptures. Hear believing Job declaring his faith, I know that my Redeemer liveth. Hear Thomas (when having ſeen he believed) crying out, My Lord and my God. Hear St. Paul clearly deſcribing the nature of his faith, The life I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me. Hear (to mention no more) all the believers who were with Paul when he wrote to the Coloſſians, bearing witneſs, We give thanks unto the Father, who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>c.</hi> i. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>But what need have we of diſtant witneſſes? You have a witneſs in your own breaſt. For am I not ſpeaking to one that loves God? How came you then to love him at firſt? Was it not, becauſe you knew that he loved you? Did you, could you love God at all, till you taſted and ſaw that he was gracious? that he was merciful to you a ſinner? What avails then controverſy or ſtrife of words? out of thy own mouth! You own you had no love to God, till you was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his love to you. And whatever expreſſions any ſinner who loves God uſes, to denote God's love to him, you will always, upon examination, find, that they directly or indirectly imply forgiveneſs. Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0010800104:299"/>love is ſtill at the root of all. He who was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended is now reconciled. The new ſong which God puts in every mouth, is always to that effect, O Lord, I will praiſe thee: though thou waſt angry with me, thine anger is turned away. Behold, God is my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I will truſt and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength and my ſong: he is alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my ſalvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xii. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>A confidence then in a pardoning God is eſſential to true faith. The forgiveneſs of ſins is one of the firſt of thoſe unſeen things, whereof faith is the evidence. And if you are ſenſible of this, will you quarrel with us concerning an indifferent circumſtance of it? Will you think it an important objection that we aſſert, that this faith is uſually given in a moment? Firſt, let me intreat you to read over that authentic account of God's dealings with men, the Acts of the Apoſtles. In this treatiſe you will find, how he wrought from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning on thoſe who received remiſſion of ſins by faith. And can you find one of theſe (except perhaps St. Paul) who did not receive it in a moment? But abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance you find of thoſe who did, beſides Cornelius and the three thouſand. And to this alſo agrees the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of thoſe who now receive the heavenly gift. Three or four exceptions only have I found in the courſe of ſeveral years. (Perhaps you yourſelf may be added to that number, and one or two more whom you have known). But all the reſt of thoſe, who from time to time among us have believed in the Lord Jeſus, were in a moment brought from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
                     <p>And why ſhould it ſeem a thing incredible to you, who have known the power of God unto ſalvation (whether he hath wrought this in your ſoul or no, for there are diverſities of operations by the ſame ſpirit), that the dead ſhould hear the voice of the Son of God, and in that moment live? Thus he uſeth to act, to ſhew, that when he willeth, to do is preſent with him.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0010800104:300"/>Let there be light, ſaid God, and there was light. He ſpake the word, and it was done. Thus the heavens and the earth were created, and all the hoſts of them. And this manner of acting in the preſent caſe, highly ſuits both his power and love. There is therefore no hindrance on God's part; ſince, as his majeſty is, ſo is his mercy: and whatever hindrance there is on the part of man, when God ſpeaketh, it is not. Only aſk then, O ſinner, and it ſhall be given thee, even the faith that brings ſalvation; and that without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or good work of thine; for it is not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. No; it is of grace, of grace alone: for unto him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>"But by talking thus you encourage ſinners." I do encourage them — to repent; and do not you? Do not you know, how many heap ſin upon ſin, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of ſuch encouragement? Becauſe they think "they can never be forgiven; there is no place for repentance leſt?" Does not your heart alſo bleed for them? What would you think too dear to part with? What would you not do, what would you not ſuffer, to bring one ſuch ſinner to repentance? Could not your love endure all things for them? Yes — if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it would do them good, if you had any hope they would ever be better." Why do you not believe it would do them good? Why have you not a hope that they will be better? Plainly, becauſe you do not love them enough; becauſe you have not that charity, which not only endureth, but at the ſame time believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and hopeth all things.</p>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <p>You ſtill think we are ſecretly undermining, if not openly deſtroying the church. What do you mean by the church? A viſible church (as our article defines it) is, a company of faithful (or believing) people: <hi>coetus credentium.</hi> This is the eſſence of a church; and the properties thereof are (as they are deſcribed in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0010800104:301"/>words that follow) that the pure word of God be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, and the ſacraments duly adminiſtered. Now then (according to this authentic account) what is the church of England? What is it indeed, but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, the true believers of England? It is true, if theſe are ſcattered abroad, they come under another conſideration. But when they are viſibly joined, by aſſembling together to hear the pure word of God preached, and to eat of one bread, and drink of one cup, they are then properly the viſible church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                     <p>It were well if this were a little more conſidered by thoſe who ſo vehemently cry out, The church! the church! (as thoſe of old, The temple of the Lord! the temple of the Lord!) not knowing what they ſpeak, nor whereof they affirm. A provincial or national church, according to our article, is, the true believers of that province or nation. If theſe are diſperſed up and down, they are only a part of the inviſible church of Chriſt: but if they are viſibly joined by aſſembling together to hear of his word and partake of his ſupper, they are then a viſible church, ſuch as the church of England, France, or any other.</p>
                     <p>This being premiſed, I aſk, how do we undermine or deſtroy the church? the provincial, viſible church of England? The article mentions three things as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a viſible church: 1ſt, Living faith, without which indeed there can be no church at all, neither viſible nor inviſible; 2dly, Preaching (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearing) the pure word of God, elſe that faith would languiſh and die; and, 3dly, A due adminiſtration of the ſacraments, the ordinary means whereby God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth faith. Now come cloſe to the queſtion: in which of theſe points do we undermine or deſtroy the church?</p>
                     <p>Do we ſhut the door of faith? do we leſſen the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of believing people in England? Only remember what faith is, according to our homilies (viz. "a ſure
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0010800104:302"/>truſt and confidence in God, that through the merits of Chriſt my ſins are forgiven, and I reconciled to the favour of God,") and we appeal to all mankind, do we deſtroy this faith, which is the life and ſoul of the church? Is there, in fact, leſs of this faith in England than there was before we went forth? I think this is an aſſertion which the father of lies himſelf will ſcarce dare to utter or maintain.</p>
                     <p>With regard then to this firſt point, it is undeniable, we neither undermine nor deſtroy the church. The ſecond thing is, the preaching and hearing the pure word of God. And do we hinder this? Do we hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any miniſter from preaching the pure word of God? If any preach not at all, or not the pure word of God, is the hindrance in us or in themſelves? Or, do we leſſen the number of thoſe that hear the pure word of God? Are then the hearers thereof (whether read or preached) fewer than they were in times paſt? Are the uſual places of public worſhip leſs frequented by means of our preaching? Whereſoever our lot has been caſt for any time, are the churches emptier than they were before? Surely none that has any regard left either for truth or modeſty, will ſay, that in this point we are enemies to, or deſtroyers of, the church.</p>
                     <p>The third thing requiſite (if not to the being, at leaſt) to the well-being of a church, is the due adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacraments, particularly that of the Lord's ſupper. And are we, in this reſpect, underminers or deſtroyers of the church? Do we either by our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or advice draw men away from the Lord's table? Where we have laboured moſt, are there the feweſt communicants? How does the fact ſtand in London, Briſtol, Newcaſtle? O that you would no longer ſhut your eyes againſt the broad light, which encompaſſes you on every ſide!</p>
                     <p>I believe you are ſenſible by this time, not only how weak this objection is, but likewiſe how eaſy it would be, terribly to retort every branch of it upon moſt of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0010800104:303"/>thoſe that make it; whether we ſpeak of true living faith, of preaching the pure word of God, or of the due adminiſtration of the ſacraments, both of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper. But I ſpare you. It ſufficeth that our God knoweth, and will make manifeſt in that day, whether it be by reaſon of us or you that men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the offering of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Others object, "That we do not obſerve the laws of the church, and thereby undermine it." What laws? The rubrics or canons? In every pariſh where I have been curate yet, I have obſerved the rubrics with a ſcrupulous exactneſs, not for wrath, but for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake: and this, ſo far as belongs to an unbene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed miniſter, or to a private member of the church, I do now. I will juſt mention a few of them, and leave you to conſider which of us has obſerved or does obſerve them moſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Days of faſting or abſtinence to be obſerved:
<list>
                           <item>The forty days of Lent,</item>
                           <item>The Ember-days at the four ſeaſons,</item>
                           <item>The three rogation-days,</item>
                           <item>All Fridays in the year, except Chriſtmas day.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. So many as intend to be partakers of the holy communion, ſhall ſignify their names to the curate, at leaſt ſome time the day before:</p>
                     <p>And if any of theſe be an open and notorious evil liver,—the curate ſhall advertiſe him, that in any wiſe he preſume not to come to the Lord's table until he hath openly declared himſelf to have truly repented.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Then (after the Nicene creed) the curate ſhall declare unto the people what holydays or faſting-days are in the week following to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The miniſter ſhall firſt receive the communion in both kinds himſelf, and then proceed to deliver the ſame to the biſhops, prieſts, and deacons, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if any be preſent, and after that, to the people.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In cathedral and collegiate churches, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, where there are many prieſts and deacons, they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0010800104:304"/>ſhall always receive the communion with the prieſt, every Sunday at the leaſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The children to be baptiſed muſt be ready at the font, immediately after the laſt leſſon.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The curates of every pariſh ſhall warn the people, that, without great neceſſity, they procure not their children to be baptiſed at home is their houſes.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The curate of every pariſh ſhall diligently, upon Sundays and holydays, after the ſecond leſſon at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, openly in the church, inſtruct and examine ſo many children as he ſhall think convenient in ſome part of the Catechiſm.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Whenſoever the Biſhop ſhall give notice for children to be brought unto him for their confirmation, the curate of every pariſh ſhall either bring or ſend in writing, with his hand ſubſcribed thereunto, the names of all ſuch perſons within his pariſh as he ſhall think fit to be preſented to the Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>Now the queſtion is not, Whether theſe rubrics ought to be obſerved (you take this for granted in making the objection) but whether in fact they have been obſerved, by you or me, moſt? Many can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I have obſerved them punctually, yea, ſometimes at the hazard of my life: and as many, I fear, that you have not obſerved them at all, and that ſeveral of them you never pretended to obſerve. And is it you that are accuſing me, for not obſerving the rubrics of the church? What grimace is this! "O tell it not in Gath! publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkelon!"</p>
                     <p>With regard to the canons, I would in the firſt place deſire you to conſider two or three plain queſtions.</p>
                     <p>1ſt, Have you ever read them over?</p>
                     <p>2dly, How can theſe be called "the canons of the church of England?" ſeeing they were never legally eſtabliſhed by the church? never regularly confirmed in full convocation?</p>
                     <p>3dly, By what right am I required to obſerve ſuch canons as were never legally eſtabliſhed?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="298" facs="tcp:0010800104:305"/>And then I will join iſſue with you in one queſtion more, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether you or I have obſerved them moſt?</p>
                     <p>To inſtance only a few.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Now let the clergyman who has obſerved only theſe five canons for one year laſt paſt, and who has read over all the canons in his congregation; (as the King's ratification ſtraitly enjoins him to do once every year) let him, I ſay, caſt the firſt ſtone at us, for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the canons (ſo called) of the church of England.</p>
                     <p>However we cannot be (it is ſaid) friends to the church, becauſe we do not obey the governors of it, and ſubmit ourſelves (as at our ordination we promiſed to do) to all their godly admonitions and injunctions. I anſwer, in every individual point of an indifferent nature. We do and will (by the grace of God) obey the governors of the church: but the teſtifying the goſpel of the grace of God, is not a point of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature. The miniſtry which we have received of the Lord Jeſus, we are at all hazards to fulfil. It is the burthen of the Lord which is laid upon us here; and we are to obey God rather than man. Nor yet do
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0010800104:306"/>we in any ways violate the promiſe which each of us made, when it was ſaid unto him, "Take thou au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preach the word of God, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt." We then promiſed to ſubmit (mark the words) to the godly admonitions and injunctions of our ordinary. But we did not, could not promiſe to obey ſuch injunctions, as we know are contrary to the word of God.</p>
                     <p>But why then, ſay ſome, do ye leave the church? Leave the church! what can you mean? do we leave ſo much as the church-walls? your own eyes tell you, we do not. Do we leave the ordinances of the church? you daily ſee and know the contrary. Do we leave the fundamental doctrine of the church, namely, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith? It is our conſtant theme, in public, in private, in writing, in converſation. Do we leave the practice of the church, the ſtandard whereof are the ten commandments? which are ſo eſſentially inwrought in her conſtitution (as little as you may apprehend it) that whoſoever breaks one of the leaſt of theſe, is no member of the church of England. I believe you do not care to put the cauſe on this iſſue. Neither do you mean this, by leaving the church. In truth, I cannot conceive what you mean. I doubt you cannot conceive yourſelf. You have retailed a ſentence from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe, which you no more underſtand than he.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Mr. Weſley then takes a retroſpective view of the ſtate of religion before the Methodiſt doctrines were preached, and the happy change produced thereby, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I cannot but intreat you who know God, to review the whole matter from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Call to mind what the ſtate of religion was, in our nation, a few years ſince. In whom did you find the holy tempers that were in Chriſt? Bowels of mercies, lowlineſs, meekneſs, gentleneſs, contempt of the world, patience, temperance, long-ſuffering? A burning love to God, rejoicing evermore, and in every
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0010800104:307"/>thing giving thanks; and a tender love to all mankind, covering, believing, hoping, enduring all things? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you did not know one ſuch man in the world. But how many, that had all unholy tempers? What vanity and pride, what ſtubbornneſs and ſelf will, what anger, fretfulneſs, diſcontent, what ſuſpicion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, what inordinate affections, what irregular paſſions, what fooliſh and hurtful deſires might you find in thoſe who were called the beſt of men? in thoſe who made the ſtricteſt profeſſion of religion? and how few did you know who went ſo far as the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religion, who had even the form of godlineſs? Did you not frequently bewail, wherever your lot was caſt, the general want of even outward religion? how few were ſeen at the public worſhip of God? how much fewer at the Lord's table? and was even this little flock zealous of good works, careful, as they had time, to do good to all men? On the other hand, did you not with grief obſerve, outward irreligion in every place? Where could you be for one week, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eye or an ear witneſs, of curſing, ſwearing, or prophaneneſs, of ſabbath-breaking or drunkenneſs, of quarrelling or brawling, of revenge or obſcenity? Were theſe things done in a corner? did not groſs iniquity of all kinds overſpread our land as a flood? yea, and daily increaſe, in ſpite of all the oppoſition which the children of God did or could make againſt it?</p>
                     <p>If you had been then told, that the jealous God would ſoon ariſe and maintain his own cauſe; that he would pour down his ſpirit from on high, and renew the face of the earth; that he would ſhed abroad his love in the hearts of the outcaſts of men, producing all holy and heavenly tempers, expelling anger, and pride, and evil deſire, and all unholy and earthly tempers; cauſing outward religion, the work of faith, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of hope, the labour of love, to flouriſh and abound; and wherever it ſpread, aboliſhing outward irreligion, deſtroying all the works of the devil: if
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0010800104:308"/>you had been told, that this living knowledge of the Lord would in a ſhort ſpace overſpread our land; yea, and daily increaſe, in ſpite of all the oppoſition which the devil and his children did or could make againſt it: would you not vehemently have deſired to ſee that day, that you might bleſs God and rejoice therein?</p>
                     <p>Behold the day of the Lord is come. He is again viſiting and redeeming his people. Having eyes, ſee ye not? having ears, do ye not hear? neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with your hearts? At this hour the Lord is roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away our reproach. Already his ſtandard is ſet up. His ſpirit is poured forth on the outcaſts of men, and his love ſhed abroad in their hearts. Love of all mankind, meekneſs, gentleneſs, humbleneſs of mind, holy and heavenly affections, do take place of hate, anger, pride, revenge, and vile or vain affections. Hence wherever the power of the Lord ſpreads, ſprings outward religion in all its forms. The houſes of God are filled; the table of the Lord is thronged on every ſide: and thoſe who thus ſhew their love of God, ſhew they love their neighbour alſo, by being careful to maintain good works, by doing all manner of good (as they have time) to all men. They are likewiſe careful to abſtain from all evil. Curſing, ſabbath-breaking, drunkenneſs, with all other (however faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable) works of the devil, are not once named among them. All this is plain, demonſtrable fact. For this alſo is not done in a corner. Now, do you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the day of your viſitation? do you bleſs God and rejoice therein?</p>
                     <p>What hinders? Is it this, that men ſay all manner of evil of thoſe whom God is pleaſed to uſe as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his works? O ye fools, did ye ſuppoſe the devil was dead? or that he would not fight for his kingdom? and what weapons ſhall he fight with if not with lies? Is he not a liar, and the father of it? Suffer ye then thus far. Let the devil and his children ſay all manner of evil of us; and let them go on deceiving
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0010800104:309"/>each other, and being deceived: but ye need not be deceived alſo. Or if you are, if you will believe all they ſay: be it ſo, that we are weak, ſilly, wicked men; without ſenſe, without learning, without even a deſire or deſign of doing good: yet I inſiſt upon the fact. Chriſt is preached, and ſinners are converted to God. This none but a madman can deny. We are ready to prove it by a cloud of witneſſes. Neither therefore can the inference be denied, that God is now viſiting his people. O that all men may know in this their day, the things that make for their peace!</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Mr. Weſley, in his <hi>Farther Appeal,</hi> thus anſwers the charge of enthuſiaſm brought againſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I aſſert, that till a man receives the Holy Ghoſt, he is without God in the world; that he cannot know the things of God, unleſs God reveal them unto him by his Spirit: no, nor have even one holy or heavenly temper, without the inſpiration of the Holy One." Now ſhould one who is conſcious to himſelf, that he has experienced none of theſe things, attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute theſe propoſitions, either from ſcripture or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, it might prove a difficult taſk. What then ſhall he do? Why, cry out, "Enthuſiaſm! Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm!" and the work is done.</p>
                     <p>But what does he mean by <hi>enthuſiaſm?</hi> Perhaps no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: few have any diſtinct idea of its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Perhaps, "ſomething very bad," or, "ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I never experienced and do not underſtand." Shall I tell you then, what that "terrible ſomething" is? I believe, thinking men mean by enthuſiaſm, a ſort of religious madneſs; a falſe imagination of being inſpired by God; and by an Enthuſiaſt, one that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies himſelf under the influence of the Holy Ghoſt, when in fact he is not.</p>
                     <p>Let him prove me guilty of this, who can. I will tell you once more the whole of my belief on theſe heads:
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0010800104:310"/>and if any man will ſhew me (by arguments, not hard names) what is wrong, I will thank God and him.</p>
                     <p>Every good gift is from God, and is given to man by the Holy Ghoſt. By nature there is in us no good thing; and there can be none, but ſo far as it is wrought in us by that good ſpirit. Have we any true knowledge of what is good? This is not the reſult of our natural underſtanding. The natural man diſcerneth not the things of the ſpirit of God: ſo that we never can diſcern them, until God reveals them unto us by his ſpirit: reveals, that is, unveils, uncovers; gives us to know what we did not know before. Have we love? It is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt which is given unto us. He inſpires, breathes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes into our ſoul, what of ourſelves we could not have. Does our ſpirit rejoice in God our Saviour? It is joy in (or by) the Holy Ghoſt. Have we true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace? It is the peace of God, wrought in us by the ſame ſpirit. Faith, peace, joy, love, are all his fruits: and, as we are figuratively ſaid to ſee the light of faith, ſo by a like figure of ſpeech we are ſaid to feel this peace and joy and love: that is, we have an inward experience of them, which we cannot find any fitter word to expreſs.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons why in ſpeaking of theſe things I uſe thoſe terms (<hi>inſpiration</hi> particularly) are, 1. Becauſe they are ſcriptural. 2. Becauſe they are uſed by our church. 3. Becauſe I know none better. The word "Influence of the Holy Ghoſt," which I ſuppoſe you uſe, is both a far ſtronger and a leſs natural term than inſpiration. It is far ſtronger, even as far as "flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſoul" is a ſtronger expreſſion than "breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it:" and leſs natural; as breathing bears a near relation to ſpirit; to which flowing in has only a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant relation.</p>
                     <p>"But you thought I had meant immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." So I do, or I mean nothing at all. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch inſpiration as is <hi>ſine mediis.</hi> But all inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0010800104:311"/>tho' by means, is immediate. Suppoſe, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you are employed in private prayer, and God pours his love into your heart. God then acts imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on your ſoul: and the love of him which you then experience, is as immediately breathed into you by the Holy Ghoſt, as if you had lived 1700 years ago. Change the term. Say, God then aſſiſts you to love him?" Well, and is not this immediate aſſiſtance? Say, "His ſpirit concurs with yours." You gain no ground. It is immediate concurrence or none at all. God a ſpirit acts upon your ſpirit. Make it out any otherwiſe if you can.</p>
                     <p>I cannot conceive how that harmleſs word <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> came to be ſuch a bugbear in the world: "Why, I thought you meant ſuch inſpiration as the Apoſtles had: and ſuch a receiving the Holy Ghoſt as that was at the day of Pentecoſt." I do, in part: indeed I do not mean, that Chriſtians now receive the Holy Ghoſt in order to work miracles; but they do doubtleſs now receive, yea, are filled with the Holy Ghoſt, in order to be filled with the fruits of that bleſſed ſpirit. And he inſpires into all true believers now, a degree of the ſame peace and joy and love, which the Apoſtles felt in themſelves on that day, when they were firſt filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>I have now conſidered the moſt material objections I know, which have been lately made againſt the great doctrines I teach. I have produced, ſo far as in me lay, the ſtrength of thoſe objections, and then anſwered them, I hope, in the ſpirit of meekneſs. And now I truſt it appears, that theſe doctrines are no other than the doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt: that they are all evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained in the word of God, by which alone I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſtand or fall; and that they are fundamentally the ſame with the doctrines of the church of England, of which I do, and ever did profeſs myſelf a member.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>By theſe extracts my readers will ſee the principles of theſe honeſt (if miſtaken) people, and will come to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0010800104:312"/>ſuch concluſion as his reaſon and underſtanding will afford him. It will not be expected of me to give my opinion; it is the buſineſs of an hiſtorian to relate facts, and not to comment upon them, particularly in caſes where religion is the concern, and in which, I think, every man has a natural right to follow the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own judgment: but before I give a brief hiſtory of their riſe, &amp;c. after this recapitulation of their principles and doctrines, I ſhall ſet before my readers what they ſay in anſwer to one or two of the moſt popular objections or calumnies raiſed againſt them; the firſt of which is, "That they create divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in private families." Their able Apologiſt
<note n="*" place="bottom">Farther Appeal, p. 91.</note> thus refutes it. "Accidentally, we do. For inſtance, ſuppoſe an entire family to have the form but not the power of godlineſs, or to have neither the form nor the power; in either caſe, they may in ſome ſort agree together. But ſuppoſe, when theſe hear the plain word of God, one or two of them are convinced, "This is the truth; and I have been all this time in the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction:" theſe then will begin to mourn after God, while the reſt remain as they were. Will they not therefore of conſequence divide, and form themſelves into ſeparate parties? Muſt it not be ſo, in the very nature of things? and how exactly does this agree with the words of our Lord? "Suppoſe ye that I came to ſend peace upon earth? I tell you nay: but rather diviſion. For from henceforth there ſhall be five divided in one houſe, three againſt two, and two againſt three. The father ſhall be divided againſt the ſon, and the ſon againſt the father: the mother againſt her daughter, and the daughter againſt the mother: the mother-in-law againſt the daughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, and the daughter-in-law againſt the mother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law. (Luke xii. 51, 52, 53.) And the foes of a man, ſhall be they of his own houſhold. (Matt. x. 36.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0010800104:313"/>Thus it was from the very beginning. For is it to be ſuppoſed, that a Heathen parent would long endure a Chriſtian child? or that a Heathen huſband would agree with a Chriſtian wife? unleſs either the believing wife could gain her huſband; or the unbelieving huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band prevailed on the wife to renounce her way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God: at leaſt, unleſs ſhe would obey him in going no more to thoſe <hi>ſocieties</hi> or <hi>conventicles,</hi> as they termed the Chriſtian aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Do you think now, I have an eye to your caſe? Doubtleſs I have; for I do not fight as one that beateth the air. Why have not I a right to hinder my own wife or child from going to a conventicle? and is it not the duty of wives to obey their huſbands? and of children to obey their parents?" Only ſet the caſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen hundred years back, and your own conſcience gives you the anſwer. What would St. Paul have ſaid to one whoſe huſband forbad her, to follow this way any more? What direction would our Saviour have given to him, whoſe father enjoined him, not to hear the goſpel? His words are extant ſtill, "He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. And he that loveth ſon or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me." Matt. x. 37, 38. Nay more, "If any man cometh to me, and hateth not (in compariſon of me) his father and mother, and wife and children, yea and his own life, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple." Luke xiv. 26.</p>
                  <p>O, but this is not a parallel caſe; for they were Heathens; but I am a Chriſtian." A Chriſtian! Are you ſo? Do you underſtand the word? Do you know what a Chriſtian is? If you are a Chriſtian, you have the mind that was in Chriſt; and you ſo walk as he alſo walked. You are holy, as he is holy both in heart and in all manner of converſation. Have you then the mind that was in Chriſt? and do you walk as Chriſt walked? are you inwardly and outwardly holy? I ſear, not even outwardly. No; you live in known
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0010800104:314"/>ſin. Alas! how then are you a Chriſtian? What a railer, a Chriſtian? a common ſwearer, a Chriſtian? a ſabbath-breaker, a Chriſtian? a drunkard or whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, a Chriſtian? Thou art a Heathen barefaced? the wrath of God is on thy head, and the curſe of God upon thy back. Thy damnation ſlumbereth not. By reaſon of ſuch Chriſtians it is that the holy name of Chriſt is blaſphemed. Such as thou they are, that cauſe the very ſavages in the Indian woods to cry out, "Chriſtian much drunk, Chriſtian beat men, Chriſtian tell lies, Devil-Chriſtian! me no Chriſtian."</p>
                  <p>It may be obſerved above, that the Methodiſts do not ſeparate from the church, nor
<note n="*" place="bottom">Farther Appeal, Part iii. p. 234.</note> diſpute about the externals or circumſtantials of religion; they approve of and adhere to them, all that they learned when they were children, in their Catechiſm and Common Prayer book. They were born and bred up in the church of England, and deſire to die therein. They always were, and now are (they ſay) zealous for the church; only not with a blind zeal. They do not, indeed, lay the main ſtreſs of their religion, on any opinions, right or wrong; neither do they ever begin, or willingly join, in any diſpute concerning them. The weight of all religion, they apprehend, reſts on holineſs of heart and life; and, conſequently, wherever they come, they preſs this with all their might. How wide then is their caſe from that of the Proteſtant Diſſenters in general? <hi>They</hi> avowedly ſeparated from the church: the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts utterly diſavow any ſuch deſign. <hi>They</hi> ſeverely, and almoſt continually, inveighed againſt the doctrine and diſcipline of the church they left: theſe approve both the doctrines and diſcipline of our church, and inveigh only againſt ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs. <hi>They</hi> ſpent great part of their time and ſtrength in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about externals and circumſtantials: the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts agree with the church of England in both; ſo
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0010800104:315"/>that having no time to ſpend in ſuch vain contention, they have their deſire in ſpending and being ſpent, in promoting plain practical religion. "I am ſick, ſays Mr. Weſley, of <hi>opinions:</hi> I am weary to bear them: my ſoul loaths this frothy food. Give me ſolid and ſubſtantial religion: give me an humble, gentle lover of God and man: a man full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocriſy: a man, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf out in the work of faith, the patience of hope, the labour of love. Let my ſoul be with theſe Chriſtians, whereſoever they are, and whatſoever opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they are of. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> thus <hi>doth the will of my Father which is heaven, the ſame is my brother, and ſiſter, and mother.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>With regard to the charges of making men idle, and thereby beggaring their families, and of driving men out of their ſenſes, Mr. Weſley thus anſwers: "This objection having been continually urged for ſome years, I will trace it from the foundation. Two or three years after my return from America, one Captain Robert Williams of Briſtol made affidavit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the (then) Mayor of the city, that "it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report in Georgia, Mr. Weſley took people off from their work, and made them idle, by preaching ſo much."</p>
                  <p>The fact ſtood thus: At my firſt coming to Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, the generality of the people roſe at ſeven or eight in the morning; and that part of them who were accuſtomed to work, uſually worked till ſix in the evening. A few of them ſometimes worked till ſeven; which is the time of ſun-ſet there at Mid-ſummer.</p>
                  <p>I immediately began reading prayers and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond leſſon, both in the morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The morning ſervice began at five, and ended at, or before ſix: the evening-ſervice began at ſeven. Now ſuppoſing all the grown perſons in the town had been preſent every morning and evening, would this have
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0010800104:316"/>made them idle? Would they hereby have had leſs, or conſiderably more time for working? The ſame rule I follow now, both at London, Briſtol, and Newcaſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon-Tyne: concluding the ſervice at every place, winter and ſummer, before ſix in the morning, and not ordinarily beginning to preach till near ſeven in the evening. Now do you, who make this objection, work longer, throughout the year, than from ſix to ſix? Do you deſire that the generality of people ſhould? Or, can you count them idle, that work ſo long? Some few are indeed accuſtomed to work longer. Theſe I adviſe not to come on week-days: and it is apparent that they take this advice, unleſs on ſome rare and extraordinary occaſion. But I hope, none of you who turn them out of their employment, have the confidence to talk of my making them idle! Do you (as the homely phraſe is) cry Wh— firſt? I admire your cunning, but not your modeſty. So far am I from either cauſing or encouraging idleneſs, that an idle perſon, known to be ſuch, is not ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in any of our ſocieties; we drive him out, as we would a thief or a murderer. "To ſhew all poſſible diligence," (as well as frugality) is one of our ſtanding rules: and one, concerning the obſervance of which, we continually make the ſtricteſt inquiry.</p>
                  <p>"But you drive them out of their ſenſes. You <hi>make them run mad.</hi>" Nay, then they are idle with a vengeance. This objection therefore being of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance, deſerves our deepeſt conſideration.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, I grant, it is my earneſt deſire to drive all the world into what you probably call <hi>madneſs:</hi> (I mean inward religion) to make them juſt as <hi>mad</hi> as Paul was when he was ſo accounted by Feſtus. I grant, ſecondly, it is my endeavour to drive all I can into what you may term another ſpecies of madneſs, which is uſually preparatory to this, and which I term repentance or conviction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:0010800104:317"/>Now, what if your wife, or daughter, or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taince, after hearing one of theſe field-preachers, ſhould come and tell you, that they ſaw damnation before them, and beheld with the eye of their mind the horror of hell? What if they ſhould tremble and quake, and be ſo taken up, partly with ſorrow and heavineſs, partly with an earneſt deſire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation, as to weep, to lament, to mourn, and both with words and behaviour to ſhew themſelves weary of life? Would you ſcruple to ſay, that they were ſtark mad? that theſe fellows had driven them out of their ſenſes? and that whatever writer it was, that talked at this rate, he was fitter for Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam than any other place?</p>
                  <p>You have overſhot yourſelf now to ſome purpoſe. Theſe are the very words of our own church. You may read them, if you are ſo inclined, in the firſt part of the homily on faſting. And, conſequently, what you have peremptorily determined to be mere lunacy and diſtraction, is that repentance unto life, which, in the judgment both of the church and of St. Paul, is never to be repented of.</p>
                  <p>I grant, thirdly, that extraordinary circumſtances have attended this conviction in ſome inſtances. A particular account of theſe I have frequently given. While the word of God was preached, ſome perſons have dropped down as dead; ſome have been, as it were, in ſtrong convulſions; ſome roared aloud, tho' not with an articulate voice; and others ſpoke the anguiſh of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>This, I ſuppoſe, you believe to be perfect madneſs: but it is eaſily accounted for, either on principles of reaſon or ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, on principles of reaſon. For how eaſy is it to ſuppoſe, that a ſtrong, lively, and ſudden apprehenſion of the heinouſneſs of ſin, the wrath of God, and the bitter pains of eternal death, ſhould affect the body as well as the ſoul, during the preſent laws of vital union;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0010800104:318"/>ſhould interrupt or diſturb the ordinary circulations, and put nature out of its courſe? Yea, we may queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether while this union ſubſiſts, it be poſſible for the mind to be affected, in ſo violent a degree, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome or other of thoſe bodily ſymptoms following?</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe eaſy to account for theſe things, on principles of ſcripture. For when we take a view of them in this light, we are to add to the conſideration of natural cauſes, the agency of thoſe ſpirits who ſtill excel in natural ſtrength, and as far as they have leave from God, will not fail to torment whom they cannot deſtroy; to tear thoſe that are coming to Chriſt. It is alſo remarkable, that there is plain ſcripture-prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of every ſymptom which has lately appeared. So that we cannot allow even the conviction attended with theſe to be madneſs, without giving up both reaſon and ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>I grant, fourthly, that touches of extravagance, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on madneſs, may ſometimes attend ſevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. And this alſo is eaſy to be accounted for, by the preſent laws of the animal oeconomy. For we know, fear or grief, from a temporary cauſe, may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a fever, and thereby a delirium.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſtrange then that ſome, while under ſtrong impreſſions of grief or fear, from a ſenſe of the wrath of God, ſhould for a ſeaſon forget almoſt all things elſe, and ſcarce be able to anſwer a common queſtion: that ſome ſhould fancy they ſee the flames of hell, or the devil and his angels around them: or that others, for a ſpace, ſhould be afraid, like Cain, whoſoever meeteth me will ſlay me. All theſe, and whatever leſs common effects may ſometimes accompany this convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are eaſily known from the natural diſtemper of madneſs, were it only by this one circumſtance, that whenever the perſon convinced taſtes the pardoning love of God, they all vaniſh away in a moment.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I have ſeen one inſtance (I pray God I may ſee no more ſuch!) of real laſting madneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:0010800104:319"/>Two or three years ſince, I took one with me to Briſtol, who was under deep convictions, but of as ſound an underſtanding in all reſpects as ever he had been in his life. I went a ſhort journey, and when I came to Briſtol again, found him really diſtracted. I inquired particularly, at what time and place, and in what manner this diſorder began? And I believe there are at leaſt threeſcore witneſſes alive, and ready to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy what follows. When I went from Briſtol, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an acquaintance with ſome perſons, who were not of the ſame judgment with me. He was ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt me. Quickly after, when our ſociety were met together in Kingſwood-Houſe, he began a vehement invective both againſt my perſon and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. In the midſt of this, he was ſtruck raving mad; and ſo he continued till his friends put him into Bedlam, and, probably, laid his madneſs too to my charge.</p>
                  <p>I fear there may alſo be ſome inſtances of real mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, proceeding from a different cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe, for inſtance, a perſon hearing me is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced, that a liar cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven: he comes home, and relates this to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or friends, and appears to be very uneaſy. Theſe good Chriſtians are diſturbed at this, and afraid he is running mad too. They are reſolved he ſhall never hear any of thoſe fellows more, and keep to it in ſpite of all his intreaties. They will not ſuffer him, when at home, to be alone, for fear he ſhould read or pray; and perhaps in a while they will conſtrain him, at leaſt by repeated importunities, to do again the very thing for which he was convinced the wrath of God cometh upon the children of diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>What is the event of this? Sometimes the ſpirit of God is quenched, and departs from him. Now you have carried the point. The man is as eaſy as ever, and ſins on without any remorſe. But in other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where thoſe convictions ſink deep, and the arrows
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0010800104:320"/>of the Almighty ſtick faſt in the ſoul, you will drive that perſon into real ſettled madneſs, before you can quench the ſpirit of God. I am afraid there have been ſeveral inſtances of this. You have forced the man's conſcience, till he is ſtark-mad: but then, pray do not impute that madneſs to me. Had you left him to my direction, or rather to the direction of the Spirit of God, he would have been filled with love and a found mind: but you have taken the matter out of God's hand. And now you have brought it to a fair concluſion!</p>
                  <p>How frequent this caſe may be, I know not. But doubtleſs moſt of thoſe who make this objection, of our driving men mad, have never met with ſuch an inſtance in their lives. The common cry is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either by thoſe who are convinced of ſin, or thoſe who are inwardly converted to God; mere madneſs both (as was obſerved before) to thoſe who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world. Yet I do not deny but you may have ſeen one in Bedlam who ſaid he had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. But obſerve, a madman's ſaying this is no proof of the fact; nay, and if he really had, it ſhould be farther conſidered, that his being in Bedlam is no ſure proof of his being mad. Witneſs the well-known caſe of Mr. Periam; and I doubt more ſuch are to be found. Yea, it is well if ſome have not been ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for no other reaſon but becauſe they followed me; their kind relations either concluding, that they muſt be diſtracted before they could do this, or perhaps ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that Bedlam would make them mad, if it did not find them ſo.</p>
                  <p>And it muſt be owned, a confinement of ſuch a ſort is as fit to cauſe as to cure diſtraction; for what ſcene of diſtreſs is to be compared to it? To be ſeparated at once from all who are near and dear to you; to be cut off from all reaſonable converſation, to be ſecluded from all buſineſs, from all reading, from every innocent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the mind, which is left to prey wholly upon itſelf, and day and night to pore over your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0010800104:321"/>fortunes; to be ſhut up day by day in a gloomy cell, with only the walls to employ your heavy eyes, in the midſt either of melancholy ſilence, or horrid cries, groans, and laughter intermixed; to be forced by the main ſtrength of thoſe "who laugh at human nature and compaſſion;" to take drenches of nauſeous, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps torturing medicines, which you know you have no need of now, but know not how ſoon you may, poſſibly by the operation of theſe very drugs on a weak or tender conſtitution. Here is diſtreſs! It is an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thing, a ſignal proof of the power of God, if any creature who has his ſenſes when that confinement begins, does not loſe them before it is at an end!</p>
                  <p>How muſt it heighten the diſtreſs, if ſuch a poor wretch, being deeply convinced of ſin, and growing worſe and worſe (as he probably will, ſeeing there is no medicine here for his ſickneſs, no ſuch phyſician as his caſe requires), be ſoon placed among the incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles! Can imagination itſelf paint ſuch a hell upon earth? where even "hope never comes, that comes to all!"—For what remedy? If a man of ſenſe and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould happen to viſit that houſe of woe, would he give the hearing to a madman's tale? or if he did, would he credit it? "Do we not know, might he ſay, how well any of theſe will talk in their lucid intervals?" So that a thouſand to one he would concern himſelf no more about it, but leave the weary to wait for reſt in the grave!"</p>
                  <p>The firſt public appearance of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, of Pembroke college, Oxford, who was an ordained clergyman of the church of England, about London, was in the year 1739, when he and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates preached up and down in the fields to vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people, with an energy that ſtruck every one, particularly in Moorfields, on Kennington Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Blackheath, &amp;c. and for ſome time they were admitted alſo into the churches to declare their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar opinions, till the indolent clergy were rouſed by
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0010800104:322"/>their extraordinary popularity; and the church-wardens fearing damages to their pews, &amp;c. &amp;c. they were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally refuſed the uſe of the public pulpits. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common fervour they expreſſed, a ſimple yet perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive eloquence, and the mortified and laborious life they led, procured them not only moſt numerous au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, but their doctrines ſuch a multitude of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as aſtoniſhed the guardians of our church: but whilſt they themſelves indolently perſiſted in their old rout of ſtated preaching, Mr. Whitefield, particularly, with a rapid progreſs, took from them thouſands of their hearers, particularly of the lower ſort, and brought many more to a ſenſe and abhorrence of their vices, and to attend his preaching, who, perhaps, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been at any kind of worſhip before. Whilſt the clergy raved both in the pulpit and in print againſt this novel doctrine, as they ſtiled it (and with what juſtice may be ſeen above) this itinerant preacher, deſpiſing all danger and fatigue, not only formed ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in England of his followers, but traverſing, time after time, immenſe tracks of land and water, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyted multitudes in all parts of North America, and extended his cares even to the inhabitants of the infant colony of Georgia, where that wiſe and excellent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, Mr. Oglethorpe, well knowing that an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to religious principles, and a life of virtue and ſelf denial, were ſpurs to induſtry and oeconomy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with open arms, and gave him all manner of aſſiſtance. Here he at length erected an <hi>Orphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> for poor and deſerted children; an inſtitution that bid fair to be of extraordinary benefit in that country; the moſt authentic account of which eſtabliſhment, by an impartial eye-witneſs, and publiſhed in juſtice to the Methodiſts, may be ſeen in the <hi>London Magazine</hi> for the year 1745, page 603. In theſe Chriſtian labours, perilous voyages, and painful journies through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of America, he was followed by Meſſ. John and Charles Weſley, his faithful and able co-adjutors,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0010800104:323"/>who with a zeal and conſtancy ſecond only to thoſe which actuated the primitive Apoſtles and diſciples of our Saviour, thought no hardſhips inſurmountable, no dangers too terrifying in proſecuting the work they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves appointed to
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Of his own and his brother's converſion, &amp;c. and of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of becoming field preachers, Mr. John Weſley gives the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account. "I was ordained deacon in 1725, and prieſt in the year following: but it was many years after this before I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the great truths above recited. During all that time, I was utterly ignorant of the nature and condition of juſtification. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I confounded it with ſanctification (particularly when I was in Georgia). At other times I had ſome confuſed notion about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins: but then I took it for granted, the time of this muſt be, either the hour of death, or the day of judgment. I was equally ignorant of the nature of ſaving faith; apprehending it to mean no more, than a "firm aſſent to all the propoſitions contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old and New Teſtament." As ſoon as, by the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, I had a clearer view of theſe things, I began to declare them to others alſo. I believed, and therefore I ſpake. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was now deſired to preach, ſalvation by faith was my only theme. My conſtant ſubjects were, "Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins." Theſe I explained and inforced with all my might, both in every church where I was aſked to preach, and occaſionally in the religious ſocieties of London and Weſtminſter; to ſome or other of which I was continually preſſed to go, by the ſtewards or other members of them. Things were in this poſture, when I was told, "I muſt preach no more in this, and this, and another church." The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was uſually added without reſerve, "Becauſe you preach ſuch doctrine." So much the more thoſe who could not hear me there, flocked together when I was at any of the ſocieties; where I ſpoke more or leſs, though with much inconvenience, to as many as the room I was in would contain. But after a ſhort time, finding thoſe rooms could not contain a tenth part of the people that were earneſt to hear, I determined to do the ſame thing in England which I had often done in a warmer climate; namely, when the houſe would not contain the congregation, to preach in the open air. This I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did, firſt at Briſtol, where the ſociety-rooms were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſmall, and at Kingſwood, where we had no room at all; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in or near London. And I cannot ſay I have ever ſeen a more awful fight, than when, on Roſe-Green, or the top of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam-Mount, ſome thouſands of people were calmly joined together in ſolemn waiting upon God, while "they ſtood, and under open sir adored the God who made both air, earth, heaven, and ſky." And whether they were liſtening to his word, with attention ſtill as night, or were lifting up their voice in praiſe, as the ſound of many waters, many a time have I been conſtrained to ſay in my heart, "How dreadful is this place! This alſo is no other than the houſe of God! This is the gate of heaven!" Be pleaſed to obſerve, 1. That I was forbidden, as by a general conſent, to preach in any church (though not by any judicial ſentence) "for preaching ſuch doctrine." This was the open, avowed cauſe: there was at that time no other, either real or pretended. 2. That I had no deſire or deſign to preach in the open air, till long after this prohibition. 3. That when I did, as it was no matter of choice, ſo neither of premeditation. There was no ſcheme at all previouſly formed, which was to be ſupported thereby; nor had I any other end in view than this, to ſave as many ſouls as I could. 4. Field-preaching was therefore a ſudden expedient, a thing ſubmitted to, rather than choſen; and therefore ſubmitted to, becauſe I thought preaching even thus better than not preaching at all; firſt, in regard to my own ſoul; becauſe a diſpenſation of the goſpel being committed to me, I did not dare not to preach the goſpel; 2dly, In regard to the ſouls of others, whom I every where ſaw ſeeking death in the error of their life."</p>
                        <p>The effects of their preaching are thus deſcribed by the ſame hand. "Juſt at this time, when we wanted little of filling up the meaſure of our iniquities, two or three clergymen of the church of England began vehemently to call ſinners to repentance. In two or three years they had ſounded the alarm to the utmoſt borders of the land. Many thouſands gathered together to hear them; and in every place where they came, many began to ſhew ſuch a concern for religion, as they never had done before. A ſtronger impreſſion was made on their minds, of the importance of things eternal, and they had more earneſt deſires of ſerving God, than they had ever had from their earlieſt childhood. Thus did God begin to draw them toward himſelf, with the cords of love, with the bands of a man. Many of theſe were in a ſhort time deeply convinced of the number and heinouſneſs of their ſins. They were alſo made tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſenſible of thoſe tempers which are juſtly hateful to God and man, and of their utter ignorance of God, and entire inability either to know, love, or ſerve him. At the ſame time, they ſaw in the ſtrongeſt light the inſignificance of their outſide religion; nay, and often confeſſed it before God, as the moſt abominable hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. Thus did they ſink deeper and deeper into that repentance which muſt ever precede faith in the Son of God. And from hence ſprung fruits meet for repentance. The drunkard commenced ſober and temperate; the whoremonger abſtained from adultery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; the unjuſt from oppreſſion and wrong. He that had been accuſtomed to curſe and ſwear for many years, now ſwore no more. The ſluggard began to work with his hands, that he might eat his own bread. The miſer learned to deal his bread to the hungry, and to cover the naked with a garment. Indeed the whole form of their life was changed. They had left off doing evil, and learned to do well. But this was not all. Over and above this outward change, they began to experience inward religion. The love of God was ſhed abroad in their hearts, which they continue to enjoy to this day. They love him, becauſe he firſt loved us, and with-held not from us his Son, his only Son: and this love conſtrains them to love all mankind, all the children of the Father of heaven and earth, and inſpires them with every holy and heavenly temper, the whole mind that was in Chriſt. Hence it is that they are now uniform in their behaviour, unblameable in all manner of converſation; and in whatſoever ſtate they are, they have learned therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; inſomuch that now they can in every thing give thanks. They more than patiently acquieſce, they rejoice and are exceeding glad, in all God's diſpenſations towards them; for as long as they love God (and that love no man taketh from them), they are always happy in God. Thus they calmly travel on through life, being never weary nor faint in their minds, never repi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>. In London, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0010800104:324"/>a great change was ſoon perceived in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the common people; an unuſual ſeriouſneſs
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0010800104:325"/>appeared in their countenances, they refrained from prophane curſing and ſwearing, and the alehouſes were deprived of their uſual inebriated gueſts. Meantime the more abandoned of the <hi>canaille,</hi> whom no precepts could reach, no future denunciations of puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from wickedneſs, ſpared not reproaches, and even frequently proceeded to open inſults and abuſes of the preachers, who were as warmly defended by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans, ſo as often to occaſion tumults and riots, that were mutually charged by the Methodiſts and their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers on each other, and kept the public for ſome years in perpetual diſpute and agitation. But, at length, now increaſed to a prodigious number, they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0010800104:326"/>began to form ſocieties apart, for worſhip in their own way, and to appoint ſtewards and other officers for the better regulation and government of thoſe ſocieties; the principal of which, in London, are the Tabernacle and Foundery near Moorfields, the Tabernacle in Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham Court road, with many others, in the city and ſuburbs. Their founders have increaſed their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Scotland and Ireland alſo, where they purſued their miſſion with the utmoſt ſucceſs; and in many places in England, where religion was ſeldom heard of, they have produced order, humanity, civility, and a ſerious regard to divine things, particularly amongſt the colliers of Kingſwood, and the fells about New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle. If the reader deſires to enter into particulars with regard to their hiſtory, he would do well to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the ſeveral <hi>Journals</hi> of Meſſ. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and <hi>Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> as I only propoſe here a general view of their riſe, &amp;c. Indeed it is a peculiar circumſtance, that no ſect, in ſo few years, ever became ſo numerous, though they have met with mild treatment from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have endured no perſecution for their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which has generally helped to increaſe, rather than to deter the followers of a new ſyſtem of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. With regard to the common people, or the mob, which is ever of the national religion, ſo far as drinking, ſwearing, and rioting for it extends, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the founders of Methodiſm, in the uſual veſtments of clergymen, captivated them, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many diſorders that would have ariſen, had perſons not diſtinguiſhed by that reverend garb endeavoured to exhort and inſtruct them; and yet, according to Mr. Weſley's account
<note n="*" place="bottom">Farther Appeal, part iii. p. 92, &amp; ſeq.</note>, he himſelf was, once particularly, in great danger of loſing his life; and the Methodiſts ſuffered by the ſpoils and ravages of deſperate and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mobs, in Staffordſhire, in the year 1743, to the amount of 504l. 17s. at the loweſt computation, owing
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0010800104:327"/>to a ſhameful connivance, perhaps under-hand encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, of thoſe who ſhould have reſtrained or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them for their diabolical exceſſes. In fact, too many of their oppoſers merit the character Mr. Weſley has given them. "
<note n="*" place="bottom">Farther Appeal, part iii. p. 136.</note> I have heard ſome affirm (ſays he) that the moſt bitter enemies to the preſent work of God were Phariſees. They meant men who had the form of godlineſs, but denied the power of it. But I cannot ſay ſo. The ſharpeſt adverſaries thereof (unleſs we might except a few honourable men, whom I may be excuſed from naming) were the <hi>ſcum</hi> of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, the <hi>rabble</hi> of Bilſton and Darleſton, the <hi>wild beaſts</hi> of Walſal, and the <hi>turnkeys</hi> of Newgate."</p>
                  <p>In fine, the very enemies of theſe people will ſcarce deny that they have greatly contributed to reform and eſtabliſh order and civility amongſt the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that they are (I mean the real Methodiſts; for Preſbyterians, Quakers, and every other ſect, have been perſonated as well as they, for intereſted or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous purpoſes) are a peaceable, upright, and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſet of people; that they cannot upon their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples diſtreſs; but muſt add ſtrength to the hands of government, and that their riſe and amazing progreſs has rouſed the eſtabliſhed clergy from that lethargy into which they had fallen, and invigorated them to be more attendant on the charge to which they were ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly appointed. Their favourite doctrines have found their way alſo into the pulpits of our churches, and many excellent preachers, who do not leave the church on that account, inforce them at this day from their pulpits. The great ſpread of Methodiſm has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contributed to ſet people in general upon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of matters of the greateſt moment to them; and I will venture to aſſert, from my own obſervation, that there has been ſuch an appearance of ſeriouſneſs, and ſuch a concern for religion, viſible in all ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0010800104:328"/>ſince it has ſo much prevailed, as cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered in any ſuch period of time ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this head with a brief account of their manner of worſhip, church-diſcipline, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>With regard to their manner of worſhip, it is like that of the church of England, ſave that they allow themſelves to continue long in extempore prayer, and that they ſing ſuch hymns as are approved by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Indeed they allow of lay-preachers, or ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men to preach or exhort, in their places of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. "I am bold to affirm (ſays Mr. Weſley) that theſe unlettered men have help from God for that great work, the ſaving ſouls from death; ſeeing he hath enabled, and doth enable them ſtill, to turn many to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thus hath he deſtroyed the wiſdom of the wiſe, and brought to nought the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. When they imagined they had effectually ſhut the door, and blocked up every paſſage, whereby any help could come to two or three preachers, weak in body as well as ſoul; who they might reaſonably believe would, humanly ſpeaking, wear themſelves out in a ſhort time: when they had gained their point, by ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as they ſuppoſed) all the men of learning in the nation, He that ſitteth in heaven laughed them to ſcorn, and came upon them by a way they thought not of. Out of the ſtones he raiſed up thoſe who ſhould beget children to Abraham. We had no more foreſight of this than you. Nay, we had the deepeſt prejudices againſt it, until we could not but own, that God gave wiſdom from above to theſe unlearned and ignorant men; ſo that the work of the Lord proſpered in their hand, and ſinners were daily converted to God.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in the one thing which they profeſs to know, they are not ignorant men. I truſt there is not one of them who is not able to go thro' ſuch an examination, in ſubſtantial, practical, experimental divinity, as few of our candidates for holy orders, even in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0010800104:329"/>(I ſpeak it with ſorrow and ſhame, and in tender love) are able to do."</p>
                  <p>There have been ſome differences amongſt the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this people, particularly between Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Weſley, relative to the doctrine of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but they agree in fundamentals: in ſmaller points, each thinks and lets think, and Mr. Weſley ſays he reverences Mr. Whitefield, both as a child of God, and a true miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. I could wiſh all religious diſputes had been managed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual candour.</p>
                  <p>As to the diſcipline of the Methodiſts, I cannot give a better account of it, than is contained in a ſmall tract, intitled, <hi>The Nature, Deſign, and general Rules, of the united Societies in London, Briſtol, Kingſwood, and Newcaſtle upon Tyne,</hi> 7th edit. 1762, which I ſhall therefore lay before my readers.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p n="1">"1. In the latter end of the year 1739, eight or ten perſons came to me in London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of ſin, and earneſtly groaning for redemption. They deſired (as did two or three more the next day) that I would ſpend ſome time with them in prayer, and adviſe them how to flee from the wrath to come, which they ſaw continually hanging over their heads. That we might have more time for this great work, I appointed a day when they might all come together, which from thenceforward they did every week, namely, on Thurſday, in the evening. To theſe, and as many more as deſired to join with them (for their number increaſed daily) I gave thoſe advices from time to time which I judged moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them; and we always concluded our meeting with prayer ſuited to their ſeveral neceſſities.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This was the riſe of the UNITED SOCIETY, firſt in London, and then in other places. Such a ſociety is no other than "a company of men having the form and ſeeking the power of godlineſs, united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0010800104:330"/>to watch over one another in love, that they may help each other to work out their ſalvation."</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That it may the more eaſily be diſcerned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are indeed working out their ſalvation, each ſociety is divided into ſmaller companies, called <hi>claſſes,</hi> according to their reſpective places of abode. There are about twelve perſons in every claſs, one of whom is ſtiled <hi>the leader.</hi> It is his buſineſs, 1. To ſee each perſon in his claſs, once a-week at the leaſt, in order to inquire how their ſouls proſper; to adviſe, reprove, comfort, or exhort, as occaſion may require; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what they are willing to give toward the relief of the poor. 2. To meet the miniſter and the ſtewards of the ſociety once a-week, in order to inform the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of any that are ſick, or of any that walk diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and will not be reproved; to pay to the ſtewards what they have received of their ſeveral claſſes in the week preceding, and to ſhew their account of what each perſon has contributed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is one only condition previouſly required in thoſe who deſire admittance into theſe ſocieties, "a deſire to flee from the wrath to come, to be ſaved from their ſins." But wherever this is really fixed in the ſoul, it will be ſhewn by its fruits. It is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of all who continue therein, that they ſhould continue to evidence their deſire of ſalvation.</p>

                           <pb n="325" facs="tcp:0010800104:334"/>6. It is expected of all who deſire to continue in theſe ſocieties, that they ſhould continue to evidence their deſire of ſalvation,</p>

                        <p n="7">7. Theſe are the general rules of our ſocieties; all which we are taught of God to obſerve, even in his written word, the only rule, and the ſufficient rule both of our faith and practice; and all theſe we know his Spirit writes on every truly awakened heart. If there be any among us who obſerve them not, who habitually break any one of them, let it be made known unto them who watch over that ſoul, as they that muſt give an account. We will admoniſh him of the error of his ways; we will bear with him for a ſeaſon: but then if he repent not, he hath no more place among us. We have delivered our own ſouls.</p>

                  <p>The Methodiſts have in ſome places, as in Totten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Court road, built alms-houſes for their more deſtitute poor; they have alſo, at times, raiſed conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſums for the relief of foreign Proteſtants, and their works of love during the late war will ever be remembered to their honour. I need not remind my reader, that Mr. Whitefield has lately received the thanks of the legiſlature at Boſton in New England, for the bountiful collection made by him towards the relief of the ſufferers by the late fire in that city.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now conclude my hiſtory of the Methodiſts with another quotation from Mr. Weſley, in anſwer to the current report of his receiving great emoluments from his preſent ſituation, as director of the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:0010800104:335"/>"But perhaps you have heard, that "we in truth regard no church at all; that gain is the true ſpring of all our actions; that I, in particular, am well paid for my work, having thirteen hundred pounds a year (as a Reverend author accurately computes it) at the Foundery alone, over and above what I receive from Briſtol, Kingſwood, Newcaſtle, and other places; and that whoever ſurvives me will ſee I have made a good uſe of my time, for I ſhall not die a beggar."</p>
                  <p>I freely own this is one of the beſt deviſed objections which has ever yet been made; becauſe it not only puts us upon proving a negative (which is ſeldom an eaſy taſk) but alſo one of ſuch a kind as ſcarce admits of any demonſtrative proof at all. But for ſuch proof as the nature of the thing allows, I appeal to my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life which hath been from the beginning. Ye who have ſeen it (and not with a friendly eye) for theſe twelve or fourteen years laſt paſt, or for any part of that time, have ye ever ſeen any thing like the love of gain therein? Did I not continually remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, "It is more bleſſed to give than to receive?" Ye of Oxford, do ye not know theſe things are ſo? What gain did I ſeek among you? Of whom did I take any thing? From whom did I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet ſilver, or gold, or apparel? To whom did I deny any thing which I had, even to the hour that I depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you? Ye of Epworth and Wroote, among whom I miniſtered for (nearly) the ſpace of three years, what gain did I ſeek among you? or of whom did I take or cover any thing? Ye of Savannah and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derica, among whom God afterwards proved me, and ſhewed me what was in my heart, what gain did I ſeek among you? Of whom did I take any thing? or whoſe food or apparel did I covet (for ſilver or gold had ye none, no more than I myſelf for many months) even when I was in hunger and nakedneſs? Ye your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, know that I lie not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0010800104:336"/>"But (it is ſaid) things are fairly altered now. Now I cannot complain of wanting any thing; having the yearly income of a Biſhop of London, over and above what I gain at other places." At what other places, my friend? inform yourſelf a little better, and you will find, that both at Newcaſtle, Briſtol, and Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood (the only places, beſide London, where any col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection at all is made) the money collected is both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and expended by the ſtewards of thoſe ſeveral ſocieties, and never comes into my hands at all, neither firſt nor laſt. And you, or any who deſire it, ſhall read over the accounts kept by any of theſe ſtewards, and ſee with your own eyes, that by all theſe ſocieties I gain juſt as much as you do.</p>
                  <p>The caſe in London ſtands thus. In November 1739, two Gentlemen, then unknown to me (Mr. Ball and Mr. Watkins) came and deſired me once and again, to preach in a place called the Foundery near Moorfields. With much reluctance I at length complied. I was ſoon after preſſed to take that place into my own hands. Thoſe who were moſt earneſt therein, lent me the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe-money, which was 115l. Mr. Watkins and Mr. Ball then delivered me the names of ſeveral ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who offered to pay, ſome four, or ſix, ſome ten ſhillings a year towards the re-payment of the purchaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, and the putting the buildings into repair. This amounted one year to near 200l. the ſecond to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 140, and ſo the laſt.</p>
                  <p>The united ſociety begun a little after, whoſe weekly contribution (chiefly for the poor) is received and expended by the ſtewards, and comes not into my hands at all. But there is alſo a quarterly ſubſcription of many of the ſociety, which is nearly equal to that above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The uſes to which theſe ſubſcriptions have been hitherto applied, are, 1ſt, The payment of that 115l. 2dly, The repairing (I might almoſt ſay rebuilding)
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0010800104:337"/>that vaſt, uncouth heap of ruins at the Foundery; 3dly, The building galleries both for men and women; 4thly, The enlarging the ſociety-room to near thrice its firſt bigneſs. All taxes and occaſional expences are likewiſe defrayed out of this fund. And it has been hitherto ſo far from yielding any overplus, that it has never ſufficed for theſe purpoſes yet. So far from it, that I am ſtill in debt, on theſe accounts, near 300l. ſo much have I hitherto gained by preaching the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel! beſides a debt of 150l. ſtill remaining on account of the ſchools built at Briſtol; and another of above 200l. on account of that now building at Newcaſtle. I deſire any reaſonable man would now ſit down and lay theſe things together, and let him ſee, whether, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing me a grain of common ſenſe (if not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty) he can poſſibly conceive, that a view of gain would induce me to act in this manner.</p>
                  <p>You can never reconcile it with any degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, that a man who wants nothing, who has already all the neceſſaries, all the conveniencies, nay, and many of the ſuperfluities of life, and theſe not only independent on any one, but leſs liable to contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than even a gentleman's freehold eſtate, that ſuch an one ſhould calmly and deliberately throw up his caſe, moſt of his friends, his reputation, and that way of life which of all others is moſt agreeable both to his natural temper and education: that he ſhould toil day and night, ſpend all his time and ſtrength, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſtroy a firm conſtitution, and haſten into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pain, diſeaſes, death—to gain a debt of ſix or ſeven hundred pounds!</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing the balance on the other ſide, let me aſk you one plain queſtion, "For what gain (ſetting conſcience aſide) will you be obliged to act thus? to live exactly as I do? For what price will you preach (and that with all your might, not in an eaſy indolent, faſhionable way) eighteen or nineteen times every
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0010800104:338"/>week? and this throughout the year? What ſhall I give you, to travel ſeven or eight hundred miles, in all weathers, every two or three months? For what ſalary will you abſtain from all other diverſions, than the doing good, and the praiſing God?" I am miſtaken, if you would not prefer ſtrangling to ſuch a life, even with thouſands of gold and ſilver."</p>

               <p>They have never been a very numerous body at any time; but in the late civil war they were moſt ſo, as great numbers of them were in the parliament army. At preſent, by what I can learn, they are but a few, meeting at two or three places of worſhip in London. They took their origin from John Agricola, who lived about the year 1335, and who taught "That the law is no way neceſſary under the goſpel: that good works do not promote our ſalvation, nor ill ones hinder it: that repentance is not to be preached from the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, but only from the goſpel

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 4, 1647, being at his houſe at Ilford, in Eſſex, he told his wife that he had been in a trance, and received a meſſage from God, which he muſt immediately deliver to the army.

               <p>They believe that the whole work of man's ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, on the croſs. —That Chriſt's blood and our ſins went away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:—That then all our ſins were taken away by Chriſt, and blotted out for ever:—That nothing elſe beſide faith is required in order to juſtification and ſalvation: —That there is but one duty, which is that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; one muſt do nothing, but quietly attend the voice of the Lord. The gates of heaven are ſhut upon workers and open to believers. If we do nothing for heaven, we do as much as God requires. To believe certainly that Chriſt ſuffered death for us, is enough; we want no more. We are juſtified by our ſubmitting <hi>in our judgments</hi> to the truth of God's grace in Chriſt Jeſus. It is not neceſſary that a man do any works that he may be juſtified and ſaved. God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thee to do any thing that thou mayeſt be ſaved or juſtified. The law ſets thee to work; but the goſpel binds thee to do nothing at all. Nay, the works are not only not required, but forbidden. God forbids us to work for juſtification: and when the Apoſtle Paul preſſeth men to believe, it is as much as if he had bid them not to work.—That the moral law is nothing to man. From any demand of the law, no man is obliged to go one ſtep, to give away one farthing, to eat, or omit one morſel. For what did our Lord do with the law? He aboliſhed it
<note n="*" place="bottom">The expreſſions I here make uſe of, are taken from ſeveral late writers who are much followed.</note>.—That a ſpiritual man beholdeth juſtifying grace in believing, without his obedience to commands for external worſhip and good works, Col.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:0010800104:341"/>ii. 20.—That outward things do nothing avail to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. If love to God, and love to our neighbour, and relieving the poor, be altogether unprofitable and unavoidable, either to juſtification or ſalvation; then theſe outward works, in ſubmitting to outward ordinances (viz. the ordinances of Chriſt) are much leſs available. —Thoſe perſons bring in the moſt dangerous kind of Popery, and pervert the goſpel of Chriſt, who perſuade men, that if they do not ſubmit to the ordinances of the Lord Jeſus, he will not confeſs them before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is better not to practiſe outward ordinances at all, than to practiſe them on theſe goſpel-deſtroying principles, to the ruining of our ſouls.—A believer has no inherent righteouſneſs: God will ſave us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without any righteouſneſs or holineſs of our own. To look for inherent righteouſneſs is to deny the ſpirit, and trample under foot the blood of the covenant. But believers have not any inherent righteouſneſs in them. Our righteouſneſs is nothing but the imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. A believer has no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf, but in Chriſt only. The trials of the ſpirit (commonly called ſanctification) ſuch as love, gentleneſs, long-ſuffering, goodneſs, meekneſs, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, neither make us holy before God, nor in our own conſciences, <hi>i. e.</hi> we are not made good or holy by any inward qualities or diſpoſitions; but being made pure and holy in our conſciences, by believing in Chriſt, we bear forth inwardly and outwardly the fruits of holineſs. A believer does not increaſe in holineſs as he increaſes in the love of God and man. The very moment he is juſtified, he is wholly ſanctified, and he is neither more nor leſs holy from that hour to the day of his death. Entire juſtification, and entire ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are in the ſame inſtant, and neither of them is, thenceforth, capable of increaſe or decreaſe. We are to grow in grace, but not in holineſs. The moment we are juſtified, we are as pure in heart as ever we ſhall
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0010800104:342"/>be. A new born babe is as pure in heart as a father in Chriſt; there is no difference.</p>
               <p>In addition to this collective detail of the principles of the Antinomians, I ſhall give my readers the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a letter received from one of them, which, perhaps, is a more perfect view of the principles of the ſect, and of many popular preachers, who yet do not ſeparate from the church, or the ſects with which they are united, on that account.</p>
               <q>This I have had occaſion to obſerve, that no ſooner does a perſon believe and profeſs ſalvation alone by Chriſt, without works of righteouſneſs, as done by him, but immediately upon his embracing ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he ſhall be branded with the name of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian, though he ſhould be at the ſame time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his change of profeſſion, as to his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and deportment in life, as unblameable as the ſtricteſt legaliſt whatever; from whence it is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty evident, that the name of an Antinomian is given to many by way of reproach or ridicule, and that there are many ſo accounted, to whom the charge does not juſtly belong; becauſe they diſown all their own works in point of merit or acceptance with God: yet that is no proof, but what they may be found in the practice of all ſuch good works as are neceſſary for good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and oeconomy in ſociety. They own the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and neceſſity of theſe, but that they do not make up or conſtitute any part of that kingdom which is ſpiritual, and is not of this world. As I am far from thinking that the religion of Jeſus conſiſts merely in externals, neither do I think that an intricate ſyſtem of doctrines (ſuch as are ſuperior to a common underſtanding) is in the leaſt neceſſary, but rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to thoſe who would be edified by what they profeſs. There ſeems to me to be two very eſſential points abſolutely neceſſary, namely, the knowledge of ourſelves, of the true ſtate of human nature, and the knowledge of ſalvation; in and through the promiſed
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0010800104:343"/>Meſſiah or Redeemer; or, in other words, that Jeſus is the Son of God, that he died for our ſins and roſe again for our juſtification, agreeable to the ſcripture teſtimony; that man is a ſinner, reaſon and revelation afford us the moſt ample proof: from whence it is likewiſe evident, that he ſtands convicted in his beſt doings and performances by the law of his Maker, which ſpiritual and divine commandment entails con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation on all who hope for mercy and acceptance by a partial and imperfect obedience. As oppoſites tend to illuſtrate, ſo does an acquaintance with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with the frailty and infirmity of our nature, ſerve to illuſtrate the beauty and extent of divine grace, as manifeſt in the perſon of Chriſt our Saviour. To ſpeak with candour and impartiality for myſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to any perſon or party whatever. As a Chriſtian, I acknowledge Chriſt as the only foundation of my hope towards God, my acceptance with him, and rejoicing in him: I reſt all my concerns for time and eternity with him, as my wiſdom to guide me thro' all the mazes of life: I ſee mercy conſiſtent with juſtice, and a plenitude of grace extending to the guilty, and all in harmony with every attribute of Deity, in and through the one mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus: the harmony and conſiſtency of the ſacred pages I likewiſe ſee in him, of whom Moſes and the prophets ſpake, every precept fulfilled by him, every threatening endured by him, and every promiſed bleſſing I lay claim unto, as my lawful inheritance, in and through him, my glorious and exalted head. In conſequence of this relation between Chriſt, as the head, and the church, his members, unſpeakable great and extenſive are the privileges which they have a claim unto, and yet with reverence they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the pre-eminence of their head in all things. The name of Jeſus, a Saviour, is to me a ſound more ſtriking, more excellent, more harmonious, than the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious notes from the beſt tuned inſtrument. The
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0010800104:344"/>whole creation, in its vaſt extent and variety, is to me as ſo many ſtriking figures of that conſummate beauty and perfection, which dwells in his adorable perſon; every amiable character by which he ſtands diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is to me full fraught with inſtruction, admiration, and conſolation: he is precious and honourable in my eſteem, and the language of the Apoſtle is with me very familiar; <hi>i. e.</hi> "I count all things but loſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, &amp;c." While I hear of various ſounds from the various ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as having learned to diſtinguiſh the voice of the true ſhepherd, I know that never varies. I ſee no danger of running into error, while I have recourſe to, and gather all my ſupplies from him, as the fountain of truth itſelf. Thus I go on in dependance upon and intercourſe with my Lord and Saviour, as, having a glimpſe of his glory, I ſometimes contemplate the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that muſt neceſſarily reſult from a happy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal exiſtence. Till that period ſhall commence, my prevailing prayer and ſupplication is, that he would teach me in all things by his influence and Spirit, that, under a ſenſe of my own inſufficiency, I may rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fulneſs; that, with a becoming gratitude of ſoul, I may acknowledge every inſtance of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all the diſpenſations of his providence and grace; that I may have a continued ſenſe of his preſence, which contains the fulneſs of joy; the views of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled countenance, which makes life pleaſant, and gives a true reliſh for every rational enjoyment, in forming a juſt eſtimation of perſons and things; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring in all ſubmiſſion to the divine will, ſo as to be able to juſtify him in the whole of his dealings towards the children of men. But perhaps you will ſay, what is all this, without the external or practical part? I anſwer, As the leſſer muſt of conſequence be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the greater; ſo, where the religion of Jeſus has its proper influence on the mind, every thing that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0010800104:345"/>is commendable and praiſe-worthy, every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a reaſonable man, becoming a Chriſtian, will be the natural product, as much as good fruit is the natural product from a good tree.</q>
               <p>Perhaps perſons acquainted with the principles of the modern Antinomians will be ſurpriſed at ſome things in this letter, and the vein of Chriſtian charity that is viſible in it. In ſhort, the writer ſeems not to be willing to be called by that name.</p>
               <p>One quotation more, and I conclude my account of the Antinomians.</p>
               <p>A remarkable DIALOGUE, publiſhed in the <hi>London Gazetteer</hi> of July 17, 1761 (introduced by a ſerious and affecting letter to the miniſter and members of the ſociety, meeting for what they call the worſhip of God, in Coachmakers Hall, Noble-ſtreet) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>J.

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 1. Did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt die for all, or only a part of mankind?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All are and will be ſaved: he being an offering for ſin, none of Adam's race can periſh or be loſt; for could that be the caſe, then Chriſt died in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 3. Is faith neceſſary to ſalvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Nor faith, nor works in man, can avail any thing; man of himſelf can do nothing; but faith is the ſum and ſubſtance of faith imputed to us as ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 4. Then (contrary to ſcripture) without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs men may ſee the Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Lord is our holineſs; therefore holineſs is not required in man, nor can avail, otherwiſe than as the holineſs of Chriſt imputed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 5. Is prayer for the pardon of ſin neceſſary?</p>

                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0010800104:346"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If man prays to eternity, it will avail nothing, becauſe the prayers of Chriſt have reached heaven for all the race of Adam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 6. Is repentance for ſin neceſſary?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, not in man, becauſe Chriſt hath repented for us, and his obedience is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 7. Did Chriſt come to reform the world, or to ſave the world unreformed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The reformation of man can avail nothing, Chriſt having reformed the world in himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 8. Suppoſe then a man continues in notorious ſins through the whole of life, unrepented of, can any faith in Chriſt ſave him, whoſe works from firſt to laſt denied him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; becauſe Chriſt being his holineſs, he lived for him, believed for him, and was obedient for him; therefore God wanted nothing of fallen man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 9. How then can it be ſaid, with any proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that man will be judged hereafter, according to the deeds done in the body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There will be no judgment after this life; for judgment is already paſt; Chriſt having juſtified us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, hath made us a free people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 10. If no judgment to come, will there be any reſurrection of the dead?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This body of fleſh will riſe no more; but our ſpirits will exiſt in Chriſt; we being the members of his body, ſhall live in him as our all in all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 11. Will there be any future puniſhment of any kind?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No; Chriſt having overcome him that had the power of death and hell, hath brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſ.</hi> 12. If no place of puniſhment, the devil being overcome by the death of Chriſt, is he annihilated, or reſtored to mercy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The latter; by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, who by his ſpirit went to preach to them that were in priſon.</p>

               <p>IN giving my readers the hiſtory of this brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I am under ſome difficulty. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have publiſhed little to the purpoſe, and are a ſet of people not very communicative. What can be done in this caſe? All that can be done is to take it, as well as the account of their principles, &amp;c. from thoſe who have wrote profeſſedly againſt them, and who having been initiated into their myſteries, afterwards forſook their ſociety; in which I am alſo juſtified, by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravians having never returned any proper anſwer to theſe writers, ſo that their veracity remains at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impeached. I ſhould have been better pleaſed to have received the proper intelligence from themſelves and their writings; but after much patience exerciſed upon the occaſion, found myſelf diſappointed. The charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mr. Henry Rimius is ſo well eſtabliſhed for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and veracity, that I ſhall venture to give their hiſtory and diſcipline in his own words.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Candid Narrative, p. 6 &amp; ſeq. printed in 1753, where are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to the authorities made uſe of, which I omit in this brief account.</note> "Nicholas Lewis, Count of Zinzendorf, is the author of Herrnhutiſm, and it is to him that the progreſs this ſect has hitherto made, is to be aſcribed. According to the account he gives of himſelf, he formed from the tenth year of his age a deſign to gather together a little ſociety of believers, amongſt whom he might live, and who ſhould entirely employ themſelves in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of devotion, under his direction. When he became of age, which was in the year 1721, his thoughts were wholly bent on executing his project, and being joined by ſome perſons, that were of his way of thinking, he ſettled at Bertholſdorf in Upper Luſatia, an eſtate which he had purchaſed, giving the curacy of that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0010800104:348"/>village, then vacant, to a ſtudent, in whom he had perceived ſentiments analogous to his own.</p>
               <p>Bertholſdorf ſoon came to be known for this ſort of piety. News thereof was brought to Moravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by a carpenter, named Chriſtian David, who, according to Le Long, had been before in that country, and there inſtilled into the minds of ſeveral people a diſtaſte to the ſuperſtition of the Romiſh church, and an inclination to the Proteſtant religion. Having engaged two or three of theſe proſelytes to leave that country with their families, Count Zinzendorf received them with gladneſs at Bertholſdorf. They were directed to build an houſe in a wood, about half a league from that village, which ſoon was finiſhed, ſo that on St. Martin's day, 1722, theſe people held their firſt meeting there. It is ſaid, that they foreſaw that God would kindle a light in this place that ſhould enlighten all the country. Chriſtian David was ſo ſure of the future growth of this ſettlement, that he already divided the ſpot of ground round it into quarters, and marked out in what direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ſtreets were to run. The event has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted this prognoſtication. A good many people from Moravia and elſewhere, to ſhelter themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of Count Zinzendorf, flocked to this new ſettlement, and built houſes; and the Count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fixed his reſidence there. In a few years it became a conſiderable village, having an orphan-houſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther public buildings. Thirty-four houſes were already built there in 1728; and in 1732 the number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants amounted to ſix hundred. An adjacent hill called the Huth-Berg, gave occaſion to theſe coloniſts to call their dwelling-place Huth des Herrn, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Herrnhuth; which may be interpreted <hi>the guard or protection of the Lord;</hi> and from this the whole ſect has taken its name.</p>
               <p>The Herrnhuters ſoon eſtabliſhed among themſelves a ſort of diſcipline, which cloſely unites them to one another, divides them into different claſſes, puts them
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0010800104:349"/>under an entire dependance on their ſuperiors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines them to certain exerciſes of devotion, and to the obſerving of different little rules. One may call it a monaſtic inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The difference of age, ſex, and the ſituation their members are in with reſpect to matrimony, conſtitute theſe different claſſes. There are claſſes of married men, married women, widowers, widows, maids, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors, children. Each has its director, choſen by its members. The ſame employments the men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, are among the women, which are exerciſed by perſons of their own ſex. Every member is daily viſited by one of his claſs, who gives him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and takes notice of the actual ſtate of his ſoul, whereof he makes a report to the elders. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent particular aſſemblies are held in each claſs, and general ones by the whole ſociety. The overſeers or leaders have alſo their private meetings to inſtruct one another in matters concerning the guidance of ſouls. The members of each claſs are ſubdivided into people that are dead, awaked, ignorant, willing diſciples, diſciples that have made a progreſs. Proper aſſiſtance is given to each of theſe ſubdiviſions; but above all, great care is taken of thoſe that are ſpiritually dead.</p>
               <p>They pay an uncommon attention to the inſtruction of youth. Beſides thoſe that have the care of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, there are others that are intruſted with that of all the other children. Count Zinzendorf's zeal has ſometimes carried him ſo far, as to take children to his own home to inſtruct them, to the number of twenty, whereof nine or ten ſlept in his bed-chamber. There are aſſemblies held of little children that are not yet in a condition to walk. They are carried thither. Hymns are ſung in theſe meetings, and prayers made; even ſermons are preached to them ſuitable to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of theſe infant-hearers.</p>
               <p>The elder, co-elder, the vice-elder, ſuperintend all the claſſes. There are likewiſe informers by office, ſome of them known, ſome kept ſecret, beſides a great
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0010800104:350"/>many other employments and titles, the detail of which would be too long and too tedious here.</p>
               <p>A great part of their worſhip conſiſts in ſinging. They pretend that children in particular are inſtructed in their religion by hymns. Count Zinzendorf relates a very extraordinary thing in his <hi>Natural Reflexions,</hi> viz. "that the chanters of the ſociety muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a particular and almoſt inimitable gift of God: for when they are obliged to ſing at the head of the congregation, their ſongs are always a connected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of thoſe matters that had been preached juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore."</p>
               <p>At all hours, whether day or night, ſome perſons, of both ſexes, are appointed by rotation to pray for the ſociety. And what is moſt remarkable, theſe people, without call, clock or watch, are acquainted, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feeling, when their hour comes in which they are to perform their duty.</p>
               <p>When the brethren perceive that the zeal of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is declining, their devotion is revived, by cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating <hi>Agapes</hi> or love-feaſts.</p>
               <p>The caſting of lots is much practiſed among them. They make uſe of it to learn the will of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The elders have the ſole right of making matches. No promiſe of marriage is of any validity without their conſent. The maids devote themſelves to the Saviour, not that their intent is never to marry, but to marry only ſuch a perſon, with reſpect to whom God ſhall have made known to them with certainty, that he is regenerated, inſtructed in the importance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal ſtate, and appointed by the divine director to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that ſtate.</p>
               <p>All is extraordinary at Herrnhut. The moſt ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born diſeaſes vaniſh there without help: very rarely one dies there of a violent fever. But it is common to die there of a cold, defluxion, or ſuch like other ſlight indiſpoſition. Theſe are at leaſt things Count Zinzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf affirms in a writing, dated January 24, 1732,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0010800104:351"/>and preſented to the miniſtry of the court of Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>I do not find that the Herrnhuters to the year 1729, pretended to be any thing more than members of the Lutheran church at Bertholſdorf. Indeed, they were all of them either born among Lutherans, or converted from Popery to the faith of the Augſburg confeſſion; and if ſome amongſt them entertained ideas of Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, Count Zinzendorf took care to cure them of it. But from this time the Herrnhuters, undoubtedly with a view to ſet their ſociety off to better advantage, would paſs for a ſprig of thoſe Bohemian and Moravian brethren, who, a long time before Luther, lived ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Romiſh church, and who in the time of the reformation entered into brotherly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the two great Proteſtant ſocieties, but without uniting with either of them. And Count Zinzendorf has ſince that time ever talked in this ſtrain. He pretends that theſe brethren originally were of the Greek church, and in proceſs of time had united with the Waldenſes, who derived their original from the Latin Church. He beſtows the greateſt encomiums on this Moravian church, ſo much renowned in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, eclipſed and forgot afterwards, and at length, if credit may be given him, revived under his auſpices at Herrnhut. He gives her the moſt pompous titles; as, the <hi>church of the Croſs,</hi>—the <hi>church of the Lamb,</hi>—the <hi>church of the Blood and Wounds,</hi>—the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> —a <hi>people whereunto never was ſeen the like,</hi>— they are <hi>the hundred forty four thouſand ſervants of God marked on their foreheads</hi>—whereof St. John makes mention in his <hi>Revelation.</hi>

               <p>This deſcent would, without doubt, do honour to Herrnhutiſm, but there is a neceſſity of proving it firſt. Let us examine whether it ever has yet been proved? So far from it, that even ſetting aſide the doctrine of the Herrnhuters, which openly contradicts this vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious pretenſion, it has been acknowledged and proved by one of their own Biſhops, that the ancient
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0010800104:352"/>Moravian brethren mixed with the reformed in Poland, and that not one of thoſe that profeſſed their doctrine remained in Bohemia and Moravia, where it has been entirely extirpated ever ſince the year 1620. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravians, who retired to Herrnhut, and who are the moſt inconſiderable part of the inhabitants of that vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, have nothing common with the ancient Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Moravian brethren. They are Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks converted to the Proteſtant religion, as the Herrn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huters themſelves acknowledge.</p>
               <p>As the Herrnhut ſociety was begun upon the eſtate of Count Zinzendorf, under his protection, by his care and benefactions, and according to his ideas and views; it was but natural he ſhould have a very great authority over it. And ſo it happens; he has always been the ſoul, the oracle, and the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of it. He tells us himſelf that he has always been at the head of his ſect, both in temporals and ſpirituals, and his diſciples ſay the ſame. Though titles could add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his authority, yet he has not diſdained them. He has even made alterations in them at different times. From the year 1726, he was called the <hi>truſtee</hi> or <hi>guardian</hi> of the brethren, which happened in a ſingular manner, as he tells us himſelf. Chriſtian David, the carpenter, of whom mention has been made, being once in the Count's apartment to talk with him, all on a ſudden gave him this title; which afterwards was confirmed by the unanimous conſent of the ſociety. In the month of March 1730, he reſigned this dignity. In September 1732, the ſociety preſſed him to take it upon him, delivering to him an appointment or call for that purpoſe, in form of an act, ſigned by the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters that were of the privy council of the ſociety. At that time he refuſed to comply, but grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their requeſt ſome months after, upon a new appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dated January 26, 1733. In 1737 Count Zinzendorf, who, from the age of ſeventeen, had believed he had a call from Providence to an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0010800104:353"/>ſtate or condition of life, and who had already publickly preached in ſome of the Lutheran churches, got himſelf conſecrated Biſhop of his ſect. From that time, according to the cuſtom of Biſhops, he made uſe of his Chriſtian name, and of that of his ſee, viz. Ludovicus Moravienſis. The Prelate of this new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhioned creation, nevertheleſs did not ſuffer himſelf to be dazzled by the luſtre of his mitre. He tells us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he had very little forwardneſs to make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as a Biſhop; and in the third general ſynod of Herrnhutiſm, held at Gotha in 1740, he laid down his epiſcopal dignity; which however had made no change with reſpect to his office of truſtee or guardian of the brethren. It appears at leaſt, that he was ſtill veſted with it in 1743, becauſe at that time the brethren diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him from it. But this was only done with a view to give him a much more honourable title, viz. that of miniſter plenipotentiary and oeconomiſt, with power to nominate a ſucceſſor, and an expreſs clauſe, that nothing of importance ſhould be done or conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without his conſent. He did not accept this new promotion till towards the cloſe of the following year. Lately we ſee him ſtile himſelf <hi>Lord Advocate of the Unitas Fratrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Count Zinzendorf has very early been about extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſect. He has ſent his fellow-labourers through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. He himſelf has been over all Europe, and at leaſt twice in America. From the year 1733, a new Herrnhut has been ſet up in Groenland; and before the end of the preceding year the miſſionaries of Herrnhutiſm had already paſſed the line. The ſociety poſſeſſes Bethlehem in Penſylvania: it has a ſettlement amongſt the Hottentots. China is entered into its plan. But it has no where made better conqueſts than in the Britiſh European dominions, in the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and in Wetteravia; in the laſt province, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, where their views were diſcovered, they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain loſt ground. They have alſo been turned out of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0010800104:354"/>the Daniſh dominions, where they had made a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>A diſcipline ſo much overburdened as that of Herrn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hutiſm, could not very well take place but in a ſmall ſociety; and we find, that in proportion as this ſect came to ſpread abroad, it was thought neceſſary to forego, in ſome meaſure, the rigour of its rule, in order to accommodate the inſtitution to the taſte, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ideas of the new proſelytes. This gave riſe to the modifications, forms, and different uſages now in being among theſe ſectaries. Count Zinzendorf calls them Tropes, Types, and at this very time there are three of them, viz. the Moravian Trope or Type, which is the moſt ancient; the Lutheran, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him to be the moſt ſalutary to the children of God; and the Reformed or Calviniſt Trope, for which he alſo has a great regard, and whereof Mr. de Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville, his ſon-in-law, was elected Biſhop in 1743. I cannot exactly ſay wherein the above three modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions differ from each other: theſe are ſecrets proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly known by the adepts alone. Thus much they have thought fit to acquaint the public with, that the Bohemian confeſſion is received by the firſt trope, the confeſſion of Augſburg by the ſecond, and that of the reformed churches in the United Provinces by the third. Indeed, from the year 1748, Count Zinzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf has made all the tropes receive the Augſburg confeſſion; however, it is pretended, that this has made no confuſion among theſe ſeveral modifications.</p>
               <p>Condeſcenſion being what has given riſe to theſe tropes, Count Zinzendorf, from the ſame motive, ſhews a general inclination to all Chriſtian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. He would have wrote to the Pope, had he known what title to give him. He has even been perſecuted for having maintained, that the Pope was not the Antichriſt. He has ſent a deputation to the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, which has been very well received. He ſhews a great attachment to Lutheran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0010800104:355"/>whereof he conſtantly pretends himſelf to be a member. He boaſts of being a miniſter of that church, and affirms, in ſpite of all that can be ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he and his brethren have no other doctrine than what is taught by that communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is of late become more favourable to Calviniſm, than he was in the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was in his power, ſays he, to have rooted it out from among the brethren; he however declined it. Although, according to him, the taking of oaths is not prohibited; yet the ſociety, wherever it ſettles, is known to be averſe to them, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably out of complaiſance to the Mennoniſts or Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts. He declares in general, that whoever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces Herrnhutiſm need not change his religion. Such advances as theſe cannot but infinitely facilitate the propagation of the ſect, which already boaſts of decimating all nations, and pretends it has a right to all the children of God of whatever perſuaſion they be.</p>
               <p>Though Count Zinzendorf tells us, that he has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times met with reſiſtance from the brethren, and that they have contradicted him; yet it appears in general, that they have ſhewed great docility both for him and thoſe he has been pleaſed to make partakers of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Submiſſion to the will of the ſuperiors of the ſociety, is a very eſſential article of his ſyſtem. He teaches, in his ſermons to the ſynod of Zeiſt, that God obeys the voice of his ſervants (that is to ſay, of the brethren); but that it is required, that firſt of all they agree with their friend, that they act in concert with their chief. The tractableneſs which he preſcribes them muſt go ſo far as to ſuffer themſelves to be led ſtep for ſtep, like little children, by men whom he calls miniſters of the Holy Ghoſt, and of the church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting them as being ſo many living images of our bleſſed Saviour. The irkſomeneſs of thus obeying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve is great, it muſt be owned; but then it is much alleviated by the notion that is inſtilled into them, that their ſuperiors receive from Chriſt himſelf
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0010800104:356"/>the orders that are given. This the Count inculcates among his flock with equal care and aſſiduity. Every thing is done by the Saviour's injunction; "Jeſus will have it ſo, the Lamb commands it:" this is the ſtile of the miniſters of the ſociety. According to them, the Saviour gives his orders on the very moment they are to be executed. He will not ſuffer that thoſe who are to obey them have time to conſider. "Thus bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is done quickly, all at once; and, as it were, in poſt-haſte." Theſe are the Count's own expreſſions, who looks upon this method of the Saviour, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion he has for his children, with whoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he is not unacquainted. He knows, adds he, for inſtance, how it is with a maid, when ſhe is appriſed ſhe is to marry: therefore he doth not willingly let perſons know their deſtination much beforehand.</p>
               <p>The ſending of miſſionaries, according to this ſect, is a buſineſs in which the Saviour is particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Count Zinzendorf informs us minutely what the Saviour preſcribes in this matter. For inſtance, ſome of the ſociety earneſtly deſiring, that thoſe of their brethren, who had been pitched upon to be ſent away, ſhould be diſpatched a day ſooner than the Saviour had appointed: the Count oppoſed this motion with ſo much ſteadineſs, that it was dropped. It was to no purpoſe they objected, that the Captains, who were to take them on board at Rotterdam, would pay no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the day appointed by the Saviour: he reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, "They will do it; or if not, our miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries will come, in another manner, to the place for which they are deſtined." This example of the Count's faith will appear leſs aſtoniſhing, when we attend to what he tells us further, viz. that he has found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the brethren, when the Saviour directed them in their travels, have performed amazing things, things which no art, no human precaution ever could attain to. He himſelf has once, without human aſſiſtance, made a voyage in eleven weeks, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0010800104:357"/>Herrnhuter could not compaſs in leſs than ſixty-ſix, becauſe he was in the hands of men. "The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (continues this great apoſtle, in a prophetical ſtrain, in his 33d ſermon, preached at Zeiſt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects his people in a quite wonderful manner. My wiſhes and deſires are, that I could bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g it to paſs, that we could have a couple of ſhips, no matter of what bulk, that belonged ſolely to the ſociety, and which the maritime powers might not ſuſpect of carrying on a trade, or being employed in ſmuggling; which may be poſſible to obtain, and depends only on a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble moment: then we ſhould ſee wonders. For, at preſent, our affairs are too much blended with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of men, with their intereſt and views; this makes a great alteration, and cannot but have, ſome way or other, an influence over the brethren. But were it once to become the Saviour's buſineſs alone, then he would let us ſee wonders on the ſea. He would not only cauſe us to make voyages with great ſwiftneſs, but to land where never any body landed. A tempeſt would be ſufficient to bring us to the intended place. In caſe leave was denied us to enter a port, we ſhould be conveyed into ſome inacceſſible bay, at ſome miles diſtance from the port, where we might land, and no body could find fault with it, becauſe it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that we were arrived there by ſtreſs of weather. This would coſt nothing to the Saviour, it would be a play to his angels."</p>
               <p>Count Zinzendorf tells us himſelf, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the ſociety was never calculated for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral converſion of the Heathen; that the time of this great event is not as yet come; but that the ſociety being an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (an election, a choſen people), it muſt have an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (the firſtlings or firſt-fruits) here and there among the Heathen. The little number the brethren have hitherto converted to the Chriſtian faith, is but a comfort, which the Saviour has granted them to make them amends for their labours, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0010800104:358"/>themſelves well rewarded for their toil, if in two hundred voyages they make but one hundred converts. He alſo tells us, that the Herrnhuters, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the firſtlings of Paganiſm, chuſe to look out for them amongſt thoſe Heathen, that have had the leaſt or no communication at all with the pretenders to Chriſtianity, rather than among the laſt.</p>
               <p>As the brethren have always a great number of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers on the roads, oftentimes among theſe their chief himſelf with his family and retinue; and as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their undertakings, and the acquiſitions they make, require conſiderable expence, it is neceſſary they ſhould have what is called the ſinew of all great ſchemes, money. Thus we find they have betimes eſtabliſhed a fund called by them the Lamb's or the Saviour's cheſt, which is become very conſiderable by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions and donations of the proſelytes of Herrnhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and its favourers. From the beginning, two brethren were truſted with it; of whom, one kept the cheſt, and the other the key; but Count Zinzendorf has always had the principal direction over it. This addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of temporal concerns muſt infallibly have cruſhed him under its weight, he being already ſo much taken up with the ſpiritual ones of the ſociety, had he not found in the Counteſs, his ſpouſe, a proper aſſiſtant to ſhare his fatigues with him. In a manuſcript hiſtory of the ſociety, whereof the Count gives us ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts in the appendix of his <hi>Natural Reflections,</hi> it is ſaid, that this Lady, during a time of twenty-ſix years, has ſo well huſbanded the ſcanty funds of the ſociety, that nothing was ever wanting, either in his family, or amongſt the brotherhood, though there had been a neceſſity of furniſhing from thence above one million of crowns for ſundry undertakings. Upon the whole, it is well known, that whoever deſires to be received as a brother, is not welcome among them, unleſs he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the cheſt. The Count ſays himſelf, "That the oeconomiſts of the ſociety may ſay to a young rich
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0010800104:359"/>man, Either give us all thou haſt, or get thee gone; give us all thou haſt, or thou canſt not be with us."</p>
               <p>I have already hinted at the rapid progreſs made by Herrnhutiſm. Here follows another curious detail, which Count Zinzendorf himſelf gives us in his <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reflections,</hi> &amp;c. wrote in the years 1748 and 1749. This will ſhew (if credit may be given to what he ſays) what ſituation the ſect was in at that time. The ſociety, ſays he, had almoſt a thouſand labourers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed all over the world. This number, however, was not yet ſufficient; for, in proportion as they work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the harveſt increaſed. Twenty-four nations had been awakened from their ſpiritual drowſineſs, by the care of theſe apoſtles. "We preach, ſays he, to an innumerable number of ſouls in fourteen languages, amongſt whom, without reckoning thoſe that do not belong to the Proteſtant religion, nor the Jews and Heathens, there are at leaſt twenty thouſand people that were not born Lutherans, whom we nevertheleſs bring to the Augſburg confeſſion, and indeed we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recommend to them a better conſtitution, than the church of the brethren. We have, adds he, ninety-eight eſtabliſhments, amongſt which are caſtles that have 20, 50, or 90 apartments." The miſſionaries of the Herrnhuters do not go and preach in every place, where their miniſtry is required. On the 28th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary 1748, they had received above one hundred and ſeventy invitations, only from Eaſter of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going year, with regard to which they had not as yet taken any reſolution. In the mean while they are not idle; in the year 1740, they had already made two hundred voyages by ſea. As to the progreſs the ſect has made abroad for theſe three years paſt, I ſhall not venture to ſpeak of, as I have not ſufficient mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for the purpoſe; but as for the ſucceſs they have met with in theſe kingdoms, and are daily making, every body is an eye-witneſs of. It is to be ſuppoſed,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0010800104:360"/>that their ſucceſs from the year 1749 muſt ſurpaſs that of the two years above-mentioned."</p>
               <p>Since the publication of the above account, the Moravians have not, perhaps, increaſed, as the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mr. Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As long as Herrnhut belonged to the church at Bertholſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, the ſociety was held in great eſteem, and not at all ſuſpected to differ from the confeſſion of Augſburg. This was the reaſon, for which the theological faculty at Tubingen, did not ſcruple to grant them thoſe teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonials, to which Count Zinzendorf has ſince that time always referred himſelf, to prove the ſoundneſs of his doctrine
<note n="‡" place="bottom">They afterwards, however, paſſed a judgment againſt them, viz. in 1747.</note>. I do not know, nor is it material to inquire, whether Count Zinzendorf began to broach his new doctrine, immediately upon the beginning of the firſt eſtabliſhment of the ſociety at Herrnhut; it ſeems more likely, that as he enlarged his plan, he enlarged his notions alſo. Thus much is certain, that it is no eaſy matter to come at the tenets of this ſect, on account of the great obſcurity affected by their teachers. They make it their ſtudy, to ſpeak and write, that they may not be underſtood. It is a rule among them, to ſpeak to thoſe, that are not initiated
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0010800104:361"/>into the myſteries of the theology of blood and wounds, that is to ſay, their own theology, in a manner, that they may not be able to tell again any thing of what they have heard. They act, ſays Count Zinzendorf himſelf, in the ſame manner as one would do, who, to catch people that are too curious, writes in a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are not able to decypher. They ſucceed wonderfully in this kind of ſtile. Sometimes they are quite unintelligible. At other times they begin to expreſs themſelves clearly, but on a ſudden become too obſcure to be underſtood. They are ſeldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely clear, and nevertheleſs ſhew often too great a clearneſs
<note n="*" place="bottom">This has been very apparent to the author of this Hiſtory.</note>. For, indeed, thoſe things that eſcape them, and are eaſy to be underſtood, do no honour either to their judgment or underſtanding. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be convinced of it by the ſpecimens I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lay before him. I ſhall take a great number of them from Count Zinzendorf's theological opinion, and his ſermons preached in America, and at Zeiſt in the province of Utrecht. Theſe laſt, to the number of fifty-ſix, were delivered to the ſynod of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, held at the laſt mentioned place in 1746, and are printed and publiſhed by the ſociety in one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. The Count has not put his name to it; for, according to a letter, inſerted in <hi>Siegfried's beſchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene Beleuchtung,</hi> directed by him to all Kings, Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Princes, &amp;c. he has left off long ago, to put his name to his writings. But it is impoſſible to read theſe ſermons, without perceiving him to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; beſides this, he declares himſelf very clearly in the preface, where he ſays, that the buſineſs of the author of theſe ſermons, is to exerciſe the office of Syndic of the ſynods, to ſuperintend the records, to adminiſter the liturgy, to prepare matters and propoſe them. I the more willingly make uſe of theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as they have been preached for the inſtruction
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0010800104:362"/>of ſeveral fellow-labourers, Engliſh and Dutch, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received among the ſect, and ſince the preacher propoſes there to himſelf, to put into a better light certain central ideas, by which one ought to regulate one's actions, words and thoughts. If it be poſſible, to meet any where with the tenets of Herrnhutiſm, it muſt be in them.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the idea this ſect has of the ſcripture. Though Count Zinzendorf doth not, as yet, think proper to diſown the ſcripture; yet the indifferent manner, in which he gives his opinion of it, ſhews what he aims at. He ſays in a ſermon preached at Philadelphia, that the ſtile of the ſcripture is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like that of a carpenter, ſometimes like that of a fiſherman, or of a toll-gatherer. Chriſt himſelf had ſpoke very meanly, and uſed many a phraſe becoming a peaſant, which is now looked upon to imply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of quite a different nature, ſince we are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the manner of ſpeaking uſed by the journeymen at Nazareth. He preſcribes a method to his miſſionaries, how to deal with the comptrollers of the ſcripture (by whom he means thoſe that deſire proofs of every doctrine out of the ſcripture) viz. that they ought to prove all ſuch things by the defects or imperfections of theſe writings, which thoſe comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers pretend to make good by the perfection and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the ſcripture. The reading of the ſcripture appears to him to be more dangerous than uſeful to the ſociety.</p>
                  <p>According to Count Zinzendorf, the doctrine that God the Father is our Creator, the Son our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Holy Ghoſt our Sanctifier, is a falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and one of the capital errors that reign in Chriſtendom. Creation and ſanctification ought not to be aſcribed to the Father and Holy Ghoſt. To avoid idolatry, people ought to be taken from the Father and Holy Ghoſt, and conducted to Chriſt, with whom alone we have to do. The ancients never
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0010800104:363"/>dreamt of a Trinity; whoever adores the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, differs not from a ſervant of Jupiter, Mercury, Apollo, or of any great hero to whom the ancients gave the title of God. Our great Doctor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo poſitive of the orthodoxy of his new opinion, that he calls the theology received among Chriſtians, a dry one, and good for nothing elſe than to amuſe dogs and ſwine, unbelievers and Atheiſts, invented by the Devil, and that ſuch as teach it are Satan's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. Satan has thought within himſelf, ſays he, <hi>Men ſhall not come to ſee the Father,</hi> that is, the true Father, who is the Saviour, according to Count Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zendorf: "I'll conduct them round about the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, I'll repreſent to them a phantom of a Father, and they ſhall think, as the Jews formerly did, that this is their God; thus the Saviour ſhall not get them. By this means, I'll keep them in my power, whilſt they think within themſelves they are very wiſe. The miſtake among Chriſtians, adds he, ariſes from their not comprehending, that it is honour enough for the Father, to be the Father of God the Creator of all things, and to be his own and only Father.</p>

Count Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zendorf, in the ſixth part of his <hi>Natural Reflections,</hi> gives a long detail to juſtify this change he makes in the common theology. He looks upon it as important and neceſſary; complaining much, that, ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, people are in groſs ignorance concerning the perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, and that the divines in this article commit a very palpable omiſſion. He adds, that ſuch as cannot comprehend the myſtery of the Trinity in the manner he explains it, want undoubred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uprightneſs of heart more than underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that the Son is chiefly the object of the Herrnhuters worſhip. Though Count Zinzendorf in plain words calls him the Carpenter Jeſus, having
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0010800104:364"/>taken along with him, into his glory, the poor figure he made in this world, yet the moſt tender names are given him. He is called their Lamb, their little Lamb, their little Jeſus. They make this name of the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine gender, calling him their mother, their Mamma Jeſua. The creation, redemption, and ſanctification is the work of Chriſt, but the Father and Holy Ghoſt <hi>miniſter</hi> to him in all of them, which is the identical word they uſe in expreſſing themſelves on this head. "Whoever believes in Chriſt, tho' he knows nothing more of the Godhead, will be ſaved. The Apoſtles, to avoid idolatry, had not baptiſed in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son and Holy Ghoſt, but in Chriſt's name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. God had darted his Son as a flaſh of lightning, and the Son by his incarnation had made a parentheſis in the Godhead. What in common life is called a grandfather, a father-in-law, ſuch was the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Son had taken it as a favour, that he was allowed to become man and go out of the Godhead. Chriſt had not conquered as God, but as a man, with the ſame ſtrength we conquer. God had aſſiſted him, and he aſſiſts us alſo. Chriſt had not had the leaſt power more than we have. He had laid aſide his Godhead, and wrought miracles as men are able to do."</p>
               <p>They have a great devotion for the five red wounds of the crucifixion, but that which Chriſt received in his ſide is extolled above all the reſt. This is "their favourite wound, the very dear little holy opening, the precious and thouſand times pretty little ſide." They kiſs this wound, they kiſs the ſpear that made it, and would kiſs the ſoldier whoſe hand conducted the ſpear; they thank him for it. It is in this opening that the faithful repoſes himſelf; there he breathes, there he ſports, there he lays down, ſometimes length-wiſe, ſometimes croſs-wiſe: there is his country, his houſe, his hall, his little bed, his little table: there he eats, there he drinks, there he lives, there he praiſes the dear little Lamb.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:0010800104:365"/>The Herrnhuters have this diſtinguiſhing character of fanaticiſm, that they reject reaſon, reaſoning and philoſophy. The children of God do not inſtruct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of books. To demonſtrate religion, to make it as evident as four times four are ſixteen, is an uſeleſs and ſuperfluous labour. Faith does not require the leaſt demonſtration. It is brought forth in the heart by the Holy Ghoſt. The children of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe they find pleaſure in believing. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs this faith, produced without reaſoning, ſerves them inſtead of all other things. No other command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be preached to men, than that of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This is Count Zinzendorf's doctrine.</p>
               <p>Regeneration comes of itſelf, without our being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do any thing towards it. It is a capital truth, ſays our Moravian Biſhop, that ſuch as have not received grace, that are not yet children of God, that have not yet a feeling of their reconciliation, that do not know yet upon what terms they are with their Creator and Saviour, ought not to be engaged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for it by any action, good works, good reſolutions
<note n="*" place="bottom">See the foregoing account of the Antinomians.</note>. They muſt be told, that all that has been believed hitherto to be a preparation for coming to God, is rather an hindrance to their ſalvation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is brought about ſuddenly, all at once. One moment is ſufficient to make us free to receive grace, to be transformed to the image of the little Lamb.</p>
               <p>A perſon regenerated enjoys great liberty. He doth what the Saviour gives him an inclination to do, and what he has no in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ination for, he is not obliged to do. He doth what the Saviour makes him do, for he is the maſter, in whoſe power it is to make laws and to repeal them; who at all times can change the oeconomy of ſalvation; make criminal what was virtuous, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous what was criminal.</p>
               <p>It is wrong to ſay, that a regenerated perſon doth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0010800104:366"/>any thing: properly ſpeaking they do nothing. It is the Saviour that acts for them. He is with reſpect to the Saviour as a child, whoſe hand one guides, yet who believes it is himſelf that writes, and rejoices at it.</p>
               <p>On the great day of judgment, the Herrnhuters will not be placed on the Saviour's left-hand among thoſe that are goats; this is to be underſtood of courſe. Nor will they be amongſt thoſe called the ſheep on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the judgment ſeat, a place of honour they look upon too mean to be aſſigned them. Count Zin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zendorf tells us, that the words, <hi>Holy angels, coming with the Saviour in his glory,</hi> denote the ſaints coming along with him, and that the Herrnhuters will be thoſe ſaints that accompany him. He adds, that ſuch as do not die Herrnhuters, will have mercy on that day, provided they think favourably upon their dying bed of thoſe belonging to that ſect.</p>
               <p>The circumciſion of the Saviour has, according to them, ſerved to ſhew of what ſex he was. It has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſtored to honour that part of the human body, which, as a conſequence of Adam's fall, was become a diſgrace to it; inſomuch, that it is at preſent the moſt noble, and the moſt reſpectable part of a man's body. The ſiſters are exhorted never to think of it, but with ſentiments of the moſt profound veneration. They are even thought to make a ſcruple of reſpecting men for any other reaſon. The organ of generation of the other ſex is no leſs honourable. It has been ſanctified by the birth of the Saviour. I abate of the ſtrength of my author's expreſſions whilſt I abridge him, for fear of offending the modeſty of my readers.</p>
               <p>All the ſouls are of the feminine ſex. There are only <hi>animae,</hi> and no <hi>animi,</hi> ſays the Moravian Biſhop with great elegance. To think that there are male-ſouls would be, according to this profound divine, the greateſt folly, a chimera, which ought not to enter the thoughts of a Chriſtian, were he even in the midſt
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0010800104:367"/>of an high fever. All that is of the male quality, and was adapted to our body, is detached from it as ſoon as it is interred. It belongs not to its natural and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate: it is an addition made to it afterwards: it is the ſeal of the office, which the male ſex is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with. For, our ſex is an employment, an office. Jeſus is the ſpouſe of all the ſiſters, and the huſbands, in the moſt proper ſenſe, are his procurators, his agents, in every reſpect like thoſe ambaſſadors in ancient times, who, on marrying a Princeſs in the name of their maſter, put a booted leg in the wedding-bed. A huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is alſo properly no more than a chamberlain of his wife; his office is but for a time, and <hi>ad interim.</hi> However, the titles which the Count gives him are not leſs glorious: he is <hi>Vice-Chriſt, Vice-God.</hi> The ſiſters are conducted to Jeſus by the miniſtry of their huſbands, who thus are their ſaviours in this world. When therefore a marriage is made, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it? Becauſe there was a ſiſter, who ſhould be brought to the true ſpouſe by the mediation of ſuch a procurator. Count Zinzendorf, in a conference on this ſubject, held at Oly with the <hi>Seventh-day men,</hi> made uſe of the following expreſſions, which, to avoid ſcandal as much as poſſible, I chuſe to give in Latin, viz. <hi>In ipſo actu conjugali moriturus, poſſem dice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori: veni de iſto actu,</hi> h. e. <hi>quem nomine tuo peregi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, two conſequences natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſult, which have not eſcaped the Count. The one is, that whoever knows himſelf to be a man, ought to acknowledge the dignity that is in him, and honour the choice that has been made of his perſon. The other, that marriage is the moſt precious depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum the Saviour has intruſted with his church; that is to ſay, without doubt, to the ſociety of Herrnhuters, and the moſt important myſtery to which he has given them the key. Conſidering this, we cannot at all be ſurpriſed at being told, that they look upon all that are married out of their ſociety to live in fornication and adultery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:0010800104:368"/>The male ſex conſiſts of married men, unmarried ones, and widowers. According to the primitive plan of the Saviour, all that had paſſed the twentieth or twenty-firſt year ſhould be married. After theſe years, the ſtate of unmarried people is a brutiſh ſtate, a ſtate of madneſs, where one doth not know one's ſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this diviſion of men into three claſſes, there is another more general one, by which they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into two choirs. One includes the married people of both ſexes, and the other the unmarried ones. Count Zinzendorf is not entirely pleaſed with either of the choirs, and much leſs with the firſt than the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. He rebukes the huſbands, and upbraids them with I do not know what abſtraction or remiſſneſs. In another ſermon he obſerves, that when the children of God will not experience phyſically certain things ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a certain age, it is caſting off human nature, they become unhappy; they forge to themſelves chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras; they ſay, I don't feel the ſame thing as other people. This appears a little obſcure, but could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be explained by what the ſublime Doctor elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where relates of a I do not know what mortification, cauſed by I do not know what non-uſe.</p>
               <p>I would here recommend to my readers a peruſal of the diſpaſſionate and well-written <hi>Expoſtulatory Letter, addreſſed to Nicholas Lewis, Count Zinzendorf, and Lord Advocate of the Unitas Fratrum, by George Whitefield, A. B.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>publiſhed in</hi> 1753, which will ſtill more elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate what has been ſaid above, relative to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and tenets of this ſociety.</p>
               <p>The following account of their belief is ſomewhat more methodical.</p>
               <p>They believe and teach
<note n="*" place="bottom">Weſley's Short View, &amp;c. p. 13.</note>, that Chriſt has done all which was neceſſary for the ſalvation of all mankind; that, conſequently, we are to do nothing, as neceſſary to ſalvation, but ſimply to believe in him; that there is but one duty now, but one command, <hi>viz.</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0010800104:369"/>in Chriſt; that Chriſt has taken away all other commands and duties, having wholly aboliſhed the law; that a believer is therefore free from the law, is not obliged thereby to do or omit any thing; it being inconſiſtent with his liberty to do any thing as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; that there is no ſuch thing as degrees in faith, or weak faith, ſince he has no faith who has any doubt or fear; that we are ſanctified wholly the moment we are juſtified, and are neither more nor leſs holy to the day of our death; entire ſanctification, and entire juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, being in one and the ſame inſtant: that a believer is never ſanctified or holy in himſelf, but in Chriſt only; he has no holineſs in himſelf at all, all his holineſs being imputed, not inherent: that a man may feel peace which paſſeth all underſtanding, may rejoice with joy full of glory, and have the love of God and of all mankind, with dominion over all ſin; and yet all this may be only nature, animal ſpirits, or the force of imagination: that if a man regards prayer or ſearching the ſcriptures, or communicating, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty; if he judges himſelf obliged to do theſe things, or is troubled when he does them not, he is in bondage, he has no faith at all, but is ſeeking ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the works of the law: that therefore, till we believe, we ought to be <hi>ſtill,</hi> i. e. not to pray, ſearch the ſcriptures, or communicate.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given the beſt account I can collect of the principles of this very myſterious ſect, for whom (in the words of Mrs. Le Fevre) <hi>I pity and pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been acquainted with ſome of them, and have found them modeſt and inoffenſive in their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and much reſigned to the ways of Providence. But it is plain they make an idol of Jeſus Chriſt, and transfer the love and worſhip due to the ſupreme God and Father of all, to the Son, as fully appears from the preceding account. In ſhort, I may ſay with Mr. Oſwald Edwards, when ſpeaking of another ſect, <hi>I hate their notions, but love the men.</hi>

The term ſignifies, in the Venetian language, an Elder: the reaſon why their miniſters were called by this name, was, that they might thereby conceal their function in remote parts, and times of perſecution. The Barbes made the education of youth, and the ſuperintendency of the public ſchools, an important branch of their employment. Out of theſe ſcholars they ſelected ſuch as had the beſt capacities for the miniſtry; and, in order to form and fit them for that office, retained them for a time in their own houſes. However the exerciſe of the miniſtry was no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obſtruction to their practice of ſome manual occupation, or ſome other ſcience, particularly phyſic, or ſurgery, in which many of them were very great proficients: they held a ſynod every year, at which time the ſtudents in divinity were examined, ordained, and appointed, either to go abroad, or to preach in ſome of their churches. Their young pupils were accuſtomed to an unlimited obedience; ſome of the Barbes were married men, though the majority of them obſerved celibacy, that they might diſcharge their functions with the leſs obſtruction or incumbrance.</item>

                  <hi>St. Barnabas's Day,</hi> a Chriſtian feſtival, celebrated on the 11th of June. St. Barnabas was born at Cyprus, and deſcended of the tribe of Levi, whoſe Jewiſh anceſtors are thought to have retired thither, to ſecure themſelves from violence during the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times in Judea. His proper name was Joſes; to which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his converſion to Chriſtianity, the Apoſtles added that of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, ſignifying either the ſon of prophecy, or the ſon of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; the firſt reſpecting his emment prophetic gifts, the other his great charity in ſelling his eſtate for the comfort and relief of the poor Chriſtians. He was educated at Jeruſalem, under the great Jewiſh doctor Gamaliel, which might probably lay the
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:382"/>foundation of that intimate friendſhip which was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted between this Apoſtle and St. Paul. The time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is uncertain; but he is generally eſteemed one of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſciples choſen by our Saviour himſelf.</item>

                  <hi>St. Bartholomew's Day,</hi> a feſtival of the Chriſtian church, celebrated on the 24th of Auguſt. St. Bartholomew was one of the twelve Apoſtles, and is eſteemed to be the ſame as Nathaniel, one of the firſt diſciples that came to Chriſt. The reaſon of this opinion is, becauſe, as St. John never mentions Bartholomew in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Apoſtles, ſo the other Evangeliſts never mention Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel; and as, in St. John, Philip and Nathaniel are joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their coming to Chriſt, ſo, in the reſt of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Philip and Bartholomew are conſtantly put together. What renders this ſtill more probable, is, that Nathaniel is particularly mentioned among the Apoſtles, to whom our Lord appeared at the ſea of Tiberias, after his reſurrection, where were preſent Simon Peter, Thomas, and Nathaniel of Cana in Galli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are likewiſe divided into Coenobites, Anchorets, and Recluſe. In the monaſteries, the religious riſe at midnight, and repeat a particular office, called from thence Meſonycticon, which takes up the ſpace of two hours; after which they retire to their cells, till five o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they return to the church to ſay mattins. At nine o'clock, they repeat the terce, ſexte, and maſs; after which they repair to the refectory, where is a lecture read till dinner. At four o'clock in the afternoon they ſay veſpers; and at ſix go to ſupper. After ſupper they ſay an office, from thence called Apodipho, and, at eight, each monk retires to his chamber and bed, till midnight. Every day, after mattins, they confeſs their faults, on their knees, to their ſuperior. They have four Lents; the firſt and greateſt is that of the reſurrection of our Lord: they call it the Grand Quarantain, and it laſts eight weeks. During this Lent, the religious drink no wine, and their abſtinence is ſo great, that, if they are obliged in ſpeaking to name milk, butter, or cheeſe, they always add this aparentheſis, "Timitis a gias ſarocoſtis;" <hi>i. e.</hi> ſave the reſpect due to holy Lent. The ſecond Lent is that of the holy Apoſtles, which begins eight days after Whitſuntide; its duration is not fixed, it continuing ſometimes three weeks, and at other times longer. During this Lent, they are allowed to drink wine. The third Lent is that of the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lady, it laſts fourteen days: during which they abſtain from fiſh, excepting on Sundays, and the day of the transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Lord.

The diſtinguiſhing tenets of Calviniſm are, 1ſt, That predeſtination and reprobation are prior to the preſcience of good or evil works. 2dly, That predeſtination and reprobation depend on the mere will of God, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the merits or demerits of mankind. 3dly, That God gives to thoſe, whom he has predeſtinated, a faith which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe: a neceſſtating grace, which takes away the freedom of the will; and that he imputes no ſin to them. 4thly, That the righteous cannot do any good work, by reaſon of original ſin, which cleaves to them. 5thly, That men are juſtified by faith only. The modern Calviniſts reject or palliate ſome of theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. In France the Calviniſts are diſtinguiſhed by the name of Huguenots; and, among the common people, by that of Parpail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots. In Germany they are confounded with the Lutherans, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general title Proteſtants; only ſometimes diſtinguiſhed by the name Reformed.</item>

                  <hi>Camaldolites,</hi> or Camaldules, a religious order founded by St. Romuald, a native of Ravenna, and deſcended from the illuſtrious houſe of its Dukes. Romuald had taſted all the pleaſures, and paſſed through all the vices, incident to youth; but continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience determined him at laſt to renounce the world, and dedicate himſelf wholly to God and religion: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he retired to Mount Caſſin, where the converſation of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, whom he met with there, confirmed him in his reſolution, and induced him to take the habit in that monaſtery. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, which he enjoined his diſciples to obſerve, was this: they dwelt in ſeparate cells, and met together only at the times of prayer; ſome of them during the two Lents of the year, obſerved an inviolable ſilence, and others for the ſpace of an hundred days. On Sundays and Thurſdays they fed on herbs, and the reſt of the week only on bread and water.</item>

                  <hi>Canon.</hi> This term ſignifies rule, according to the import of the Greek. It is particularly uſed in the language of the church, to ſignify ſuch rules as are preſcribed by councils concerning faith, diſcipline, and manners. It is made uſe of likewiſe to denote thoſe books of ſcripture which are received as inſpired and cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and to diſtinguiſh them from either profane, apocryphal, or diſputed books. There have been various collections of the canons of the Eaſtern councils; but there are four principal ones, each ampler than the preceding ones; the firſt, according to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher, A. D. 380, containing only thoſe of the firſt oecumenical council, and the five principal ones; they were but 164 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: To theſe Dionyſius Exiguus, in the year 520, added the fifty canons of the Apoſtles, and thoſe of other general councils. The Greek canons in this ſacred collection, and with thoſe of the council of Chalcedon; to which are ſubjoined thoſe of the council of Sardica, and the African councils. The fourth and laſt collection comes down as low as the ſecond council of Nice; and it is on that Balſamon and Zonaras have commented. Canon is alſo uſed (as before obſerved) for the authoriſed catalogue of the holy writings. The ancient canon, or catalogue of the books of the Old Teſtament, was made by the Jews, and is ordinarily attributed to Eſdras. This is the canon allowed to have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the primitive church till the council of Carthage, and according to St. Jerom conſiſted of no more than twenty-two books. But that council enlarged the canon very conſiderably, taking into it the books which we call the Apocrypha; which the council of Trent have farther inforced, injoining all theſe to be received as books of holy ſcripture, upon pain of anathema, and being attainted of hereſy.</item>

                  <hi>Canonization,</hi> a declaration of the Pope, whereby, after a great deal of ſolemnity, they enter into the liſt of the ſaints ſome perſon who has lived an exemplary live, and wrought miracles. The word ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization ſeems to be of later origin than the thing; there being
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:390"/>no inſtance of the uſe of the word before the 12th century: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as St. Uldaricus was canonized in the tenth. The name is from canon, in regard the primitive canonizations were only orders of the Popes or Biſhops, whereby perſons eminent for piety, &amp;c. were inferred in the canon of the maſs, that they might be commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the ſervice, for that in thoſe days the uſe of martyrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies was unknown in the church. Mabillon diſtinguiſhes two kinds of canonization, a general and particular: the firſt made by a general council, or a Pope; the ſecond by a Biſhop, a particular church, or a provincial council. There are inſtances likewiſe of canonization, at leaſt ſomething very like them, by Abbots. At firſt only martyrs were canonized; by degrees they came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. It is diſputed whether the martyrdom does not ſupply the want of miracles. Canonization anciently conſiſted in inſerting the ſaint's name in the ſacred Diptychs, or canon of ſaints; in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a proper office for invoking him, and erecting churches under his invocation, with altars for maſs to be celebrated on; taking up the body from the firſt place of its burial, and the like ceremonies. By degrees, other formalities were added; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions made with the ſaint's image in triumph, the day of his death is declared a feaſt; and, to render the thing ſtill more ſolemn, Honorius III. in 1225, added ſeveral days indulgence to a canonization.</item>

They are cloathed with brown or grey, always bare-footed, are never to go in a coach, nor ever ſhave their beard. The Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins are a reform made from the Minors, commonly called <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers,</hi> ſet on foot in the ſixteenth century by Matthew Baſchi, a religious obſervant of the monaſtery of Montefiaſcone, who, being a Roman, was advertiſed ſeveral times from heaven to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the rule of St. Francis to the latter. Upon this he made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Pope Clement, in 1525, who gave him permiſſion to retire into a ſolitude, and not only him, but as many others as would embrace the ſtrict obſervance, which ſome did accordingly. In 1528, they obtained the Pope's bull; in 1529, the order was brought into complete form. Matthew was elected General, and the chapter made conſtitutions. In 1543, the right of preaching was taken from the Capuchins by the Pope; but, in 1545, it was reſtored to them again with honour.

                  <hi>Cardinal,</hi> is more particularly uſed for an eccleſiaſtic Prince, one who has a voice both active and paſſive in the Roman conclave, at the election of a Pope. Some ſay the Cardinals were ſo called from the Latin, <hi>incardinatio,</hi> which ſignifies the adoption any church made of a prieſt of a foreign church, driven thence by misfortune; and add, that the uſe of the word commenced at Rome and Ravenna; the revenues of the churches of which cities being very great, they became the common refuge of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py prieſts of all other churches. The Cardinals compoſe the Pope's council or ſenate in the Vatican; are a conſtitution of Pope John, which regulates the rights and titles of Cardinals; in which he declares, that as the Pope repreſents Moſes, ſo the Cardinals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſeventy diſciples, who, under the Pontifical authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, decide private and particular differences. Cardinals, in their firſt inſtitution, were only the principal prieſts, or incumbents of the pariſhes of Rome. In the primitive church, the chief prieſt of a pariſh, who immediately followed the Biſhop, was called <hi>presbyter cardinalis,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from the other petty prieſts, who had no church nor preferment. The term was firſt applied to them in the year 150; others ſay, under Pope Silveſter, in the year 300. Theſe Cardinals alone were allowed to baptiſe, and adminiſter the euchariſt. When the Cardinal prieſts became Biſhops, their cardinalate became vacant, they being then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be raiſed to a higher dignity. Under Pope Gregory, Cardinal prieſts and Cardinal deacons were only ſuch prieſts or deacons as had a church or chapel under their care; and this was the original uſe of the word. Leo IV. in the council of Rome held in 853, calls them <hi>presbyteros ſui cardinalis,</hi> and their church is <hi>parochios cardinales.</hi> The Cardinals continued on this footing till the eleventh century; but as the grandeur of his ſtate and Holineſs became exceedingly augmented, he would have his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Cardinals make a better figure than the ancient prieſts had done. It is true, they ſtill preſerved their ancient title; but the thing expreſſed by it was no more. It was a good while, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ere they had the precedence over Biſhops, or got the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope into their hands; but when they were once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of thoſe privileges, they ſoon had the red hat and purple, and, growing ſtill in authority, became at length ſuperior to the Biſhops, by the ſole quality of being Cardinals.</item>

                  <hi>Chorepiſcopi.</hi> In the ancient church, when the dioceſes became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by the converſion of Pagans in the country, and villages at a great diſtance from the city-church, the Biſhops appointed themſelves certain aſſiſtants, whom they called <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by their office they were Biſhops of the country. There have been great diſputes among the learned concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this order. Among the ſchoolmen and canoniſts, it is a received opinion, that they were mere Preſbyters. Others think there were two ſorts of Chorepiſcopi; ſome that had Epiſcopal ordination, and others that were mere Preſbyters. But a third, and the moſt probable opinion, is, that they were all Biſhops. This is the ſentiment of Biſhop Barlow, Dr. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The chriſm is prepared on Holy Thurſday with a world of ceremony. In Spain it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the cuſtom for the Biſhop to take one-third of a ſol for the chriſm diſtributed to each church on account of the balſam that entered its compoſition. Du Cange obſerves, there are two kinds of chriſm; the one prepared of oil and balſam, uſed in baptiſm,
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:396"/>confirmation, and ordination; the other of oil alone, conſecrated by the Biſhop, uſed anciently for the catechumens, and ſtill in extreme unction. The Maronites, before their reconcilement with Rome, beſides oil and balſam, uſed muſk, ſaffron, cinnamon, roſes, white frankincenſe, and ſeveral other drugs mentioned by Rynaldus, in 1541, with the doſes of each. The Jeſuit Dandini, who went to Mount Libanus in quality of the Pope's Nuncio, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, in a ſynod held there in 1596, that chriſm for the future ſhould be made only of two ingredients, oil and balſam; the one repreſenting the human nature of Jeſus Chriſt, the other his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature. The action of impoſing the chriſm is called <hi>chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> This the generality of the Romiſh divines hold to be the next matter of the ſacrament of confirmation. The chriſmation in baptiſm is performed by the prieſt; that in confirmation by the Biſhop; that in ordination, &amp;c. is more uſually ſtiled <hi>unction.</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> a name firſt given at Antioch to the followers of Chriſt. They were ſometimes called brethren, faithful, ſaints, believers, friends, &amp;c. The names of Nazarenes and Gallileans were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe given them by the Gentiles. It is the opinion of ſome, that Chriſtian was derived originally from the Greek word <hi>chriſtos,</hi> good, uſeful, &amp;c. and applied to their Kings, as denoting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or ſacred. Hence the King of France bears the title or ſirname of The Moſt Chriſtian King, <hi>Rex Chriſtianiſſimus.</hi> The French antiquaries trace the original of the appellation up to Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the Great; who writing a letter to Charles Martel, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally gave him that title, which his ſucceſſors have ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The Chriſtians were ſometimes ſtiled Gnoſtics, <hi>i. e.</hi> men of underſtanding and knowledge; a name which was aped and abuſed by a perverſe ſort of heretics, who are commonly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the name of Gnoſtics, becauſe of their pretences to knowledge and ſcience, falſely ſo called. Another name, which frequently occurs in the writings of the ancients, is that of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophori, which ſignifies temples of God, and is as old as Ignatius. We ſometimes alſo meet with the name Chriſtophori, uſed in the ſame ſenſe; yet it is very obſervable, that in all the names they choſe there were ſome peculiar relation to Chriſt or God; for party-names, and human appellations, they ever profeſſed to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor. Euſebius records a ſtory of one Sactus, a deacon of the church of Vienna, who ſuffered in the perſecution under Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus. Being put to the rack, and examined by the magiſtrate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:397"/>his name, his country, his city, and his quality, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all theſe queſtions was, "I am a Chriſtian." This, he ſaid, was to him both name, and city, and kindred; nor could his perſecutors extort any other anſwer from him. The firſt Chriſtians diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the moſt remarkable manner by their conduct and their virtues. The faithful, whom the preaching of St. Peter had converted, hearkened attentively to the exhortations of the Apoſtles, who ſailed not carefully to inſtruct them, as perſons who were entering upon an entirely new life: they went every day to the temple with one heart and one mind, and continued in prayers, doing nothing different from the other Jews, becauſe it was not yet time to ſeparate them. But they made a ſtill greater progreſs in virtue; for they ſold all that they poſſeſſed, and diſtributed their goods in proportion to the wants of their brethren. They eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, praiſing God, and having favour with all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. St. Chryſoſtom, examining from what ſource the eminent virtue of the firſt Chriſtians ſlowed, aſcribes it principally to their diveſting themſelves of their poſſeſſions: for (ſays that Father) perſons from whom all that they have is taken away, are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto ſin; whereas, whoever has large poſſeſſions, wants not a devil or a tempter to draw him into hell a thouſand ways.</item>

                  <hi>Church,</hi> is a religious aſſembly, or the large fair building where they meet; ſometimes means a ſynod of Biſhops or Preſbyters, and in ſome places the Pope and a general council. Bellarmine, and the Romiſh divines, to this definition add, under the ſame Pope, ſovereign Pontiff, and Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt on earth; in which circumſtance it is that the Romiſh and reformed notion of church differ. Amelotte and others make a viſible head, or chief, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a church. Accordingly, among the Catholics the Pope, in England the King, are reſpectively allowed heads of the church. Biſhop Hoadley ſets aſide the notion of a viſible head:
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:398"/>Chriſt alone, according to him, is head of the church; which poſition he has maintained with great addreſs, in a celebrated ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before King George I. on theſe words, <hi>My kingdom is not of this world;</hi> and in the ſeveral vindications thereof. Sometimes we conſider church in a more extenſive ſenſe, and divide it into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches. The church militant is the aſſembly of the faithful on earth; church triumphant, that of the faithful already in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to which the Catholics add the church patient, that of the faithful in Purgatory. <hi>Eccleſia,</hi>

It was an uſual garment among the Romans; and therefore a Biſhop, or Preſbyter, wearing a collobium, is no proof that the clergy in thoſe early times were diſtinguiſhed by their habit from the laity, as ſome have thought, but is rather a proof of the contrary.</item>

                  <hi>Commendam,</hi> in the canon or eccleſiaſtical law, is the charge, truſt, or adminiſtration of a benefice, given either to a layman to hold by way of depoſitum, for ſix months, in order for repairs, &amp;c. or to another eccleſiaſtic, or beneficed perſon, to perform the paſtoral duties thereof, till ſuch time as the benefice is provided of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular incumbent. Anciently commendams were a very laudable inſtitution; for when an elective benefice became vacant, for which the ordinary could not for ſome reaſon immediately provide, the care of it was recommended to ſome man of merit, who took upon him the direction of it till the vacancy was filled up, but who enjoyed none of the profits. Commendam, in the church of Rome, is likewiſe a real title of a regular benefice, ſuch as an abbey or priory given by the Pope to a ſecular clerk, or even to a layman, with power to diſpoſe of the fruits thereof during life: and, by the Pope's bulls, the commendatory abbot has the full authority of the regular abbot, to whom he is ſubſtituted, except ing only in <hi>ſpiritualibus,</hi> the direction of which is left to the clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral prior. Benefices in commendam are veſted in the crown by a ſtatute of Henry VIII. This right was conteſted in the reign of King James I. who deſigning to give in commendam a vacant church, it was diſputed in the court of Common Pleas, not only whether the King might grant a commendam to a Biſhop, either before or after his conſecration; but alſo whether commendams were to be granted without neceſſity. The point was ſolemnly argued by the judges, who were ſeverely reprimanded at the council-board by the King, for daring to attack the prerogative royal.</item>

                  <hi>Communion,</hi> the being united in doctrine and diſcipline. In this ſenſe of the word different churches are ſaid to hold communion with each other; and in the primitive Chriſtian church every Biſhop was obliged, after his ordination, to ſend circular letters to foreign or remote churches, who profeſſed the ſame faith, to ſignify that he was in communion with them. To maintain this unity of the faith entire, every church was ready to aſſiſt all others in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with her, by oppoſing all fundamental errors and hereſies; and this gave occaſion to moſt of the provincial and national ſynods we read of, in which novel, and what they thought erroneous doctrines, were condemned by a council of Biſhops. This unity was alſo further maintained by the readineſs of each church, and every member of it, to join with all other churches in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:400"/>of doctrine, worſhip, and all holy offices, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, by a mutual conſent in ratifying all legal acts of diſcipline regularly exerciſed in any church whatſoever, by unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the cuſtoms of the church of Rome, and adhering to the decrees of councils, both general and national. All the Chriſtian churches were originally in communion with each other, having one common faith and diſcipline; in proceſs of time a diverſity of opinions prevailed, and occaſioned ſome churches to ſeparate from the reſt, and to form the diſtinct communions into which the Chriſtian church is at preſent divided. The three grand commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are that of the church of Rome, that of the Greek church, and that of the Proteſtant churches.</item>

The conclave is a range of ſmall cells, ten feet ſquare, made of wainſcot; they are numbered, and drawn for by lot; they ſtand in a line along the galleries, and half the Vatican, with a ſmall ſpace between each. Such Cardinals as were created by the late Pope hang their cells with violet-coloured ſtuff, and the reſt with green ſerge: each cell has the arms of the reſpective Cardinal. Strong guard is kept at the door of the Vatican, and round the conclave, and many precautions, with much ceremony, made uſe of, to prevent any intelligence being conveyed, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or bribery, &amp;c. but, notwithſtanding that, great artifice is made uſe of to effect an election, and it is generally obtained by corruption.</item>

                  <hi>Convocation,</hi> a general aſſembly of the clergy of a province, ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King's writ, to conſult of the more weighty affairs of the church, as oft as a parliament is convoked to conſult thoſe of the ſtate. The King's writ is directed to the Archbiſhop of each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, requiring him to ſummon all Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons, of cathedral, collegiate churches, &amp;c. The place where the convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the province of Canterbury have been uſually held, is St. Paul's church, whence of late they have been prorogued to St. Peter's in Weſtminſter, in the chapel of Henry VII. or the Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem chamber, where there is an upper and lower houſe. The power of the convocation is limited by a ſtatute of King Henry VIII. They are not to make any canons, or eccleſiaſtical laws, without the King's licence; nor, when permitted to make any, can they put them in execution, but under theſe reſtrictions. 1. Such canons muſt not be contrary to the King's prerogative. 2. They muſt not contradict any ſtatute, or the common law. 3. Nor muſt they alter any known cuſtom of the realm. They have the examining and cenſuring all heretical and ſchiſmatical books and perſons, &amp;c. but there lies an appeal to the King in Chancery, or to his delegates. The clergy in convocation, and their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, have the ſame privileges as members of parliament.</item>

By an act of King Edward VI. whenſoever the Biſhop ſhall celebrate the holy communion in the church, he ſhall have upon him, beſides his rochet, a ſurplice or albe, and a cope, &amp;c. It anſwers to the collobium or epiſcopal habit of the ancient church, and was at firſt a common habit, being a coat without ſleeves; but was afterwards uſed as a church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtment, only made very rich by embroidery, and the like.

                  <hi>Copiotae,</hi> a particular order of men, in the primitive Chriſtian church, whoſe buſineſs it was to inter the dead. They were ſo called, either from the pains they took, or elſe becauſe they committed the bodies of the dead to the grave, a place of eaſe and reſt. They were inſtituted in the time of Conſtantine, or his ſon Conſtantius, in two of whoſe laws they are expreſsly mentioned. Their particular office was to prepare the graves, wrap up the bodies of the dead, and then bury them; and becauſe this was ever accounted a work of piety and religion, therefore the Copiotae, though not in holy orders, were conſidered as bearing a relation to the clergy, and veſted with the ſame immunities. Their number was very great: Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is ſaid to have appointed no leſs than eleven hundred; but, by a law of Honorius and Theodoſius, they were reduced to nine hundred and fifty, though Anaſtaſius afterwards brought them back to the firſt number.</item>

<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:404"/>deſigned to repreſent the body of our Saviour, being wrapt in fine linen by Joſeph of Arimathea. The inſtitution of it is aſcribed to Euſebius, Biſhop of Rome, about the year 300.</item>

                  <hi>Covenant.</hi> The firſt covenant between God and man was that which he made with Adam at his creation, when he required him to forbear the uſe of the forbidden fruit. The ſecond covenant is that which God made with man after his fall, by promiſing him not only forgiveneſs, provided he repented, but alſo the coming of the Meſſiah, who ſhould redeem him, and all the human race, from death. A third covenant is that which God made with Noah, when he directed him to build an ark. A fourth covenant is that which God made with Abraham, the mark and ſeal of which was circumciſion. But the greateſt, moſt ſolemn, moſt excellent, and moſt perfect, which God ever made with man, is that which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into with us through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, that eternal covenant, which muſt ſubſiſt to the end of ages: the prieſthood, ſacrifice, and laws, are infinitely more exalted than thoſe of the Old Teſtament.</item>

Mabillon maintains the coul to be the ſame thing in its origin with the ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular. The author of the apology of the Emperor Henry IV. diſtinguiſhes two forms of couls; the one a gown, reaching to the feet, having ſleeves and a capuchon, uſed in ceremonies; the other a kind of hood to work in, called alſo ſcapular, becauſe it only covers the head and ſhoulders.</item>

In caſes of practice, by precedents in diſcipline, by decrees and conſtitutions. Theſe are not called for deciding political controverſies; this properly belonging to diets, parliaments, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Councils,</hi> OEcumenical or General, are aſſemblies of all the prelates in Chriſtendom, in the ſtrict ſenſe of it. But to conſtitute a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly, it was never deemed neceſſary for all the prelates to be actually preſent; it is ſufficient that the council be regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed, and that they are called to be there: A proxy might repreſent them, or if they chuſe to abſent themſelves, it will nevertheleſs be eſteemed oecumenical. General councils are ſometimes called by eccleſiaſtical authors plenary councils. The Romaniſts reckon eighteen, whereof only the four firſt are admitted by the reformed. The eighteen are thus numbered, viz. two of Nice, four of Conſtantinople, one of Epheſus, one of Chalcedon, five of the Lateran, two of Lyons, one of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, one of Florence, and the laſt of Trent, which laſt ordained provincial councils to be held every three years, yet the laſt held was at Bourdeaux in France, more than 100 years ago.—The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and decrees of councils have been often collected, viz. by Dr. Merlin of Paris, 1524. Another at Venice, in 1585. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Rome, in 1608. One of Binius, canon of Cologne, 1606, in 10 vols. Another at Louvre in 1664, in 37 vols.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt oecumenical</hi> or <hi>General Council,</hi> as well as the firſt of Nice, ſo called becauſe it was eſtabliſhed at Nice in Bythinia, by the authority of Conſtantine the Great, in the time of Julius I. and Sylveſter, began in May, A. D. 325, and ended Auguſt 25, the ſame year; it conſiſted of 318 biſhops. They condemned the Arian, the Melitian, and Novatian doctrines, and cenſured the diſſenſions betwixt the eaſtern and weſtern biſhops about the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the paſſover.—The ſeventh general council, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Nice, began September 24, 789, and ended about the 15th of October, occaſioned by the conteſt about the worſhip of images.—The ſecond general council, and the firſt of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> began in May 381, and ended in July, under Gratian, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius the Great, and Damaſus, and conſiſted of 157 biſhops.—The
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:406"/>fifth general council, and the ſecond of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> began May 4, A. D. 553, and ended in July following; it was occaſioned by the followers of Neſtorius endeavouring to revive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his opinions in oppoſition to the aſſerters of a trinity of perſons, coeternal and coequal, and more expreſsly containing the Emperor Juſtinian's confeſſion of faith, againſt the three chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and addreſſed to the aſſembly of the Catholic and Apoſtolic church: at the concluſion it was decreed, that there was in Jeſus only one ſubſtance, one perſon, and one operation, and anathematiſes thoſe who had wrote againſt it, as Theodoret, &amp;c.— The ſixth general council, and third of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> begun in Trullo, under the Emperor Progenatus (ſolicited by Pope Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho) Nov. 7, A. D. 680, and continued till September 16. In this were convened 150 biſhops, who condemned the Menothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Sergius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Peter, Paul, Theodorus, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Pope Honorius, who favoured the doctrine of one will in Chriſt. This council was reaſſumed, and called the Quini-Sextum council, and fourth of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and was held in 192 at Trullo, in the tower of the Emperor's palace. The four Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs of the Eaſt were preſent at it, and it is acknowledged by the Greeks to be a general council; there were 108 biſhops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the deſign of their aſſembling was to ſupply the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their former councils with reſpect to diſcipline. They made 102 canons, many of them trifling in their nature, others very ſevere and oppreſſive to ſuch as differed in point of faith or diſcipline. The moſt remarkable is the 52d canon, ordering that the maſs of the pre-ſanctified ſhall be celebrated every day in Lent, except Saturday and Sunday, and Lady-Day.—The third general council was held at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> June 22, 431, to the end of July; it was called under Theodoſius the Younger, promoted by Celeſtine I. It conſiſted of 200 biſhops, who condemned Neſtorius of Conſtantinople, who denied the unity of two natures in Chriſt. Anathematiſed the Maſſilianites or Euchites, and confirmed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Nicene creed.—The fourth general council was held at Chalcedon, and began October 8, 431, and ended Nov. 1, A. D. 455. It conſiſted of 630 biſhops, who condemned the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious acts of the council of Epheſus: they affirmed one only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be in Chriſt, after his incarnation, viz. his divine nature; and decreed 29 canons, many of which are not approved by the Papiſts, viz. in one of the canons, that all biſhops are equal with reſpect to power or privileges.—The eighth general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in 869, began on the 5th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, and ended the laſt day of February the next year, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Photius and his adherents.—The ninth general council, and the firſt of Lateran, was held in March, A.

The acts of this aſſembly contain ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty canons.—The primacy was determined in favour of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Conſtantinople; but Innocent III. thought it beneath his dignity to wear a croſs.—Dupin ſays, the Pope, in his letters of interdiction, repreſents this council to be neceſſary for the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Land, and the reformation of the Catholic church; for correcting irregularities, and reforming the manners of the church, both in the prieſthood and people; and for condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herefies, putting a ſtop to diviſions, and eſtabliſhing peace.— The thirteenth general council, and the firſt of Lyons, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by Pope Innocent IV. in 1245, as well for civil as eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actical affairs. The Pope propoſed three principal points, viz.

People anciently flocked on theſe croiſades out of devotion; the Pope's bull, and the preaching of the prieſts of thoſe days, making it appear a point of conſcience. Hence ſeveral orders of knighthood took their riſe. Thoſe who meant to go on this errand, diſtinguiſhed themſelves by croſſes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent colours, wore on their cloaths, and were thence called <hi>croiſes:</hi> the Engliſh wore them white, the French red, the Flemiſh green, the Germans black, and the Italians yellow.

The firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in 1095, at the council of Clermont: the ſecond in 1144, under Louis VII.: the third in 1188, by Henry II. of England and Philip Auguſtus of France: the fourth in 1195, by Pope Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtin III. and the Emperor Henry VI. the fifth publiſhed in 1198, by order of Innocent III. wherein the French, Germans, and Venetians engaged: the ſixth, under the ſame Pope, began tumultuouſly, in 1213, and ended in the rout of the Chriſtians: the ſeventh, reſolved on at the council of Lyons, in 1245, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:410"/>by St. Louis: the eighth, which was the ſecond of St. Louis, and the laſt of all, in 1268. It is ſaid that it was the Ciſtertian monks who firſt projected the croiſades. Philip Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus ſolicited the execution thereof with the holy ſee; and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent III. raiſed the firſt ſtandard of the croſs.

This method of ſuffering was eſteemed the greateſt mark of infamy; and therefore commonly inflicted on perſons of the meaneſt rank, and for the worſt of crimes. It was a common manner of puniſhment among the Syrians, Egyptians, Perſians, Greeks, and Romans. The Croſs to which our Saviour was nailed, was in the form of a T; that is, of the Old Samaritan <hi>Tau.</hi> The manner of crucifixion was by faſtening the criminals with nails, one through each hand, and one through each foot; and ſometimes the perſons were ſcourged with whips. But the hiſtory of our Lord's crucifixon and paſſion are ſo particularly related by the Evangeliſts, that they need not be repeated. The reſpect paid by the ancient Chriſtians to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's croſs, was by no means ſuch a ſuperſtitious regard as is paid by the Romaniſts to the repreſentation of it in their churches and other places. The devotion of the croſs makes a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the religion of the Romiſh church. Towards the cloſe of the 7th century, the 6th general council of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople decreed, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be painted in a human form upon the croſs; the more ſtrongly to ſet before the eyes of Chriſtians the death and paſſion of our Saviour. This alſo gave the firſt riſe to the uſe of <hi>crucifixes.</hi> Among the Romaniſts, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſet up in churches, placed on altars, conſecrated with great ſolemnity, carried in proceſſion, placed in the ſtreets at places of public reſort, and homage required to be paid to them. Their
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:411"/>Biſhops wear a pectoral or breaſt-croſs, which hangs by a gold-chain or ſilver-ſtring about their necks. Theſe modern repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the croſs are called <hi>crucifixes.</hi> Before the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation it was eſteemed a piece of devotion to erect croſſes on hills, in church-yards, or over the tombs of great perſonages, &amp;c.</item>

                  <hi>Croſs, exaltation of.</hi> A feſtival of the Greek and Romiſh churches, obſerved on the 14th of December. In the reign of Heraclius, Coſroes, King of Perſia, ſacked Jeruſalem; and together with other plunder, carried off that part of the croſs left there, in memory of our Saviour, by the Empreſs Helena, which he ſent into Perſia. After many battles, in which the Perſians were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways defeated, Heraclius had the good fortune to recover the croſs. This Prince carried it to Jeruſalem himſelf, and laying aſide his Imperial ornaments, marched with it on his ſhoulders to the top of Mount Calvary, from whence it had been taken. The memory of this action was perpetuated by the feſtivals of the re-eſtabliſhment (or, as it is now called) the exaltation of the croſs. The latter name was given to this feſtival, becauſe, on this day, they exalted, or ſet up, the croſs in the great church at Conſtantinople, in order to ſhew it to the people. This feſtival is diſtinguiſhed among the Coptic or Egyptian Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by the benediction of a particular croſs, which is afterwards thrown into the river Nile, in order to make its waters fall away, or rather as a grateful acknowledgment of the ineſtimable bleſſings which attend its overflowing.</item>

<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:412"/>in the Pſalms is a cup of thankſgiving, which, while people drank, they bleſſed the Lord, and were thankful for his mercies.

                  <hi>Datary,</hi> an officer in the Pope's court. He is always a Prelate, and ſometimes a Cardinal, deputed by his Holineſs to receive ſuch petitions as are preſented to him, touching the proviſion of benefices. The Datary has power to grant, without acquainting his Holineſs therewith, all ſuch benefices as do not exceed twenty-four ducats annually; but for ſuch as amount to more, he is obliged to get the proviſions ſigned by the Pope, who admits him to audience every day. If there be ſeveral candidates for the ſame place, he has the liberty of beſtowing it on which of them he thinks proper, provided he has the requiſite qualifications. This officer has likewiſe a ſubſtitute; but he can confer no benefice at all. When a perſon has obtained the Pope's conſent for a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Datary ſubſcribes his petition, <hi>annuit ſanctiſſimus,</hi> i. e. The moſt holy father conſents to it. After the petition has paſſed the proper offices and is regiſtered, it is carried to the Datary, who dates it, and writes theſe words, <hi>datum Romae apud,</hi> &amp;c. given at Rome in the Pontifical palace, &amp;c. Afterwards the Pope's bull, granting the benefice, is diſpatched by the Datary, and paſſes thro' the hands of more than 1000 perſons, belonging to fifteen diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent offices, who have all their ſtated fees.

                  <hi>Day, Lammas,</hi> the firſt of Auguſt, celebrated as a feſtival, in the Romiſh church, in memory of St. Peter's impriſonment. Eudocia, the wife of Theodoſius the Emperor, having made a journey to Jeruſalem, was there preſented with the fetters which St. Peter was loaded with in priſon. Theſe ſhe preſented to the Pope, who afterwards laid them up in a church, built by Theodoſius, in honour of St. Peter. Eudocia, in the mean time, having obſerved that the firſt of Auguſt was celebrated in memory of Auguſtus Caeſar, who had on that day been ſaluted Auguſtus, and upon that account given occaſion to the changing the name of the month, from Sextilis to Auguſt, that Princeſs thought it not reaſonable that a holyday ſhould be kept in memory of an Heathen Emperor, and therefore obtained a decree of Theodoſius, that this day ſhould for the future be kept holy, in remembrance of St. Peter's bonds. This feſtival is known, in the Roman calendar, by the name of the feaſt of St. Peter <hi>(in vinculis)</hi> in fetters. It was called among us Lammas Day, from a fond conceit the Popiſh people had, that St. Peter was patron of the lambs, becauſe our Saviour ſaid to him, <hi>feed my lambs;</hi> upon which account they thought the maſs of this day very beneficial to make their lambs thrive.</item>

Hence, according to the divers kinds of parts in any thing, <hi>viz.</hi> phyſical parts, metaphyſical parts, &amp;c. ariſe ſo many different kinds of definitions of the ſame thing. Thus, man is either defined an animal, conſiſting of ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or a reaſonable animal, &amp;c.</item>

                     <hi>Deiſts,</hi> a ſect or claſs of people, known under the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Freethinkers, whoſe diſtinguiſhing character it is, not to profeſs any particular form or ſyſtem of religion, but only to acknowledge the exiſtence of a God, without rendering him any external worſhip or ſervice. The Deiſts hold, that, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the multiplicity of religions, the numerous pretences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and the precarious arguments generally advanced in proof thereof, the beſt and ſureſt way is, to return to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of nature, and the belief of one God, which is the only truth agreed to by all nations. They complain, that the freedom of thinking and reaſoning is oppreſſed under the yoke of religion, and that the minds of men are ridden and tyrannized by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity impoſed on them of believing inconceivable myſteries; and contend, that nothing ſhould be required to be aſſented to, or believed, but what their reaſon clearly conceives. The appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Deiſt is more particularly given to ſuch as are not altogether without religion, but reject all revelation as an impoſition, and believe no more than what natural light diſcovers to them; as, that there is a God, a Providence, a future ſtate, with rewards and
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:416"/>puniſhments for the good and the bad; that God muſt be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and his will, ſo far as we can learn it, performed; but that each perſon is to do this after his own manner, and as his own conſcience ſuggeſts. The number of Deiſts is ſaid to be daily increaſing in England: a great part of the men of ſpeculation and letters are pretended to incline that way; and the like is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſome of our neighbour nations, where freedom of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, writing, and thinking, are indulged.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Clarke gives us a ſuccinct character of ſeveral ſorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt ſort are thoſe who profeſs to believe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of an eternal, infinite, independent, and intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that this Supreme Being made the world; but they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that God does not at all concern himſelf in the government of the world, nor has any regard to, or concern about what is done therein: nor is the doctrine of ſome philoſophers much different, who aſcribe every thing to matter and motion, and ſpeak of God as an <hi>intelligentia ſupramundana,</hi> which is the very language of Epicurus and Lucretius.—A ſecond ſort of Deiſts profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not only the being, but alſo the providence of God; that is, that every <hi>natural</hi> thing that is done in the world is produced by the power, appointed by the wiſdom, and directed by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, though, not allowing any difference between mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good and evil, they ſuppoſe that God takes no notice of the morally good or evil actions of men, theſe things depending, as they imagine, merely on the arbitrary conſtitution of human laws. —Another ſort of Deiſts there are, who have right apprehenſions concerning the natural attributes of God, and his all-governing Providence, and ſeem alſo to have ſome notion of his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections alſo: they believe him to be a being infinitely knowing, powerful, and wiſe, and, in ſome ſenſe, a being of juſtice, as of goodneſs and truth; that he governs the world by theſe perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and expects ſuitable obedience from all his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but they are prejudiced againſt the immortality of human ſouls, and inſiſt that men periſh at death entirely, and that one generation ſhall perpetually ſucceed another, and that there will be no future reſtoration or renovation of things.—A fourth ſort there are, who profeſs to believe the being and attributes of God, the obligations of natural religion, and that there will be a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; but all this ſo far only as it is diſcoverable by the light of nature alone, without believing any divine revelation. Theſe, he concludes, are the only true Deiſts. But there is now no conſiſtent ſcheme of Deiſm in the world. The Heathen philoſophers, thoſe few of them who taught and lived up to the obligations of natural religion, had indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent ſcheme of Deiſm, ſo far as it went. Socrates and Tully appear to be wiſe and ſteady in their principles and conduct, and they were thence led to hope for a revelation, and we wiſh the
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:417"/>ſame ſpirit prevailed in our modern Deiſts; then we might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conclude they would embrace, and not ridicule Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall ſubjoin what I have farther received from an honeſt and conſiſtent Deiſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>A Deiſt, or Theiſt, is one that believes a God, who rejects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and follows his reaſon only. This general definition, I imagine, will be granted by all the Deiſts or Theiſts in the world. Some of them, who believe man to be a free agent, have not much better or different notions of God than other people, believing him to be a perfect, rational, and moral being, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where diſtinct from the univerſe, once from all eternity exiſting by himſelf, before any thing was created; but that his wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, is infinitely extended, according as he wills to diſplay it. Some of them believe free-will, and others not, which is the moſt material difference between them; and this difference ariſes from ſome mens making more ſtrict natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries than others. The one think the doctrine of neceſſity of dangerous conſequence; the other, believing things are as they are appointed, or muſt be, conceive this doctrine can no more alter the conduct of men, than the nature of things, which are unalterable and eternal, being governed and directed by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; his Spirit being in all, operates in all; that in him all creatures live, and have their being; for he is their life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in them, and they in him; and is to the univerſe what the ſoul is to the body; and all the appearances of things to us are the cloathing of Deity; for we ſee not things as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as they are to us, and ſo we judge of them; therefore we judge for ourſelves, not for God; we cannot judge of them as he judges; that of all things generated, which appear and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, it may be ſaid, as the author of the epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews ſays, "they all wax old as doth a garment, and as a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God folds them up;" but he is the ſame, and his years do not change; neither had the ungenerated parts of the univerſe a beginning, nor will ever end. There is no beginning nor end to time, motion, and the exiſtence of things; and as God unites the whole, there is no vacuum in nature, no place void of life and exiſtence; that vegetable, animal, and rational life, are but different degrees of the ſame life, different powers communicated from, or different manifeſtations of God, who makes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes, builds and deſtroys, according to his will, which is the ſame as his wiſdom and power, for theſe in him are one.—Thoſe who maintain neceſſity have as much regard to moral virtue as others, but not to any kind of worſhip; therefore are more of the philoſophic than of the religious claſs. Like the Epicureans, they think honourably of God, reſpecting the greatneſs, wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and dignity of his nature, but, unlike them, they aſcribe nothing to chance. They conceive that the divine, unchangeable nature, it not wrought upon by the prayers of men, nor regards
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:418"/>their praiſes; that the whole of our duty, whether you allow it to be religion or not, is acting in the beſt manner we can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, as mens different wants are, and our different abilities are to aſſiſt them; that God is not indebted to man for any of his good deeds, though men are to one another; for no man has any good quality, from whence any good deed proceeds, that is not the gift of God; that God makes each of us what we are, and virtue carries its own reward with it, as the ancient phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers maintained; the like does wiſdom; ſo has God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the affairs of this world; for if he does not things that are right in this world, how do we know he will do right in any other, who, we have reaſon to believe, is in all worlds the ſame, and governs all by univerſal, mathematical, mechanic, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able laws?—In the ſelect pieces of M. de Voltaire, I find one on Theiſm, p. 179, where he ſays, that "Theiſm is a religion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through all other religions; it is a metal that mixes with all others, and whoſe veins extend under the earth to the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the world. This ore is moſt uncovered, and moſt wrought, in China; every where elſe it is concealed, and the ſecret is in the hands of none but the adepts. There is no country in which there are more of theſe adepts than in England."—Many have aſked, if Theiſm, ſeparately conſidered, and without any other religious ceremony, is in reality a religion? The anſwer is eaſy. He who acknowledges a God only as a Creator, he who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God only as an infinitely powerful Being, and who ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his creatures but admirable machines, is no more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious with reſpect to him, than an European who admires the King of China is on that account the ſubject of that Prince.— But he who thinks that God has condeſcended to put a connection between himſelf and mankind; that he has made them free, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of good and evil; and that he has given to all a moral ſenſe, which is the inſtinct in man, and on which is founded the law of nature; he, without doubt, has a religion, and a religion much better than all the ſects out of our church: for all theſe ſects are falſe, and the law of nature is true; for a revealed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can only be this law of nature perfected. Thus Theiſm is good ſenſe not yet enlightened by revelation, and other religions good ſenſe perverted by ſuperſtition.—All ſects are different, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come from men; morality is every where the ſame, becauſe it comes from God.—It may be aſked, that ſince there are five or ſix hundred ſects, of which ſcarcely any are free from the guilt of ſpilling human blood, from whence does it happen that the Theiſts, who are every where ſo numerous, have never cauſed the leaſt tumult? It is becauſe theſe are philoſophers. Now philoſophers may reaſon falſely, but they can never engage in intrigues; therefore thoſe who perſecute a philoſopher, under pretence that his opinions may be dangerous to the public, are guilty of as great an abſurdity as a perſon who ſhould be afraid
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:419"/>leſt the ſtudy of algebra ſhould raiſe the price of bread: we ought, therefore, to pity a reaſonable being who is in an error; but the perſecutor is a fool, and an object of horror. We are all brethren: if any of my brothers, full of reſpect and filial piety, and animated by the moſt ardent fraternal love, does not ſalute our common father with the ſame ceremonies as I, ought I to cut his throat, and tear out his heart?</p>

Grammarians content themſelves with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, philoſophers require definitions of things. A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an enumeration of divers attributes of a thing, moſt of which are only accidental, as when a perſon is deſcribed by his deeds, his ſayings, his writings, his honours, &amp;c. A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to its outward appearance, reſembles a definition, and is even convertible with the thing deſcribed, but does not explain it; for inſtead of bringing ſeveral things eſſential to the thing deſcribed, it only brings a number of accidents belonging thereto, e. g. Peter is the tall young man who lives on the green, wears black cloaths, frequents the college, courts N—, &amp;c. where, it is evident, we do not give any explication of Peter, as not bringing things that are in Peter, but only circumſtances, or things about him, tall, young, living, wearing, frequenting, courting, &amp;c. A deſcription, therefore, is no proper anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>quid eſt, what is he?</hi> but to that, <hi>quis eſt, who is he?</hi> Deſcriptions, in effect, are principally uſed for ſingulars or individuals, for things of the ſame ſpecies do not differ in eſſence, but only as to <hi>hic</hi> and <hi>ille,</hi> which difference contains nothing very notable or diſtinguiſhable. But individuals, of the ſame kind, differ much in accidents, e. g. George is a King, and William a citizen, Charles is a male, and Anne a female; Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is wife, and John a blockhead, &amp;c. Thus, a deſcription is an accumulation of accidents, whereby things are notably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from each other, tho' they ſcarce differ at all in eſſence.</item>

I ſhall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in this place, of the more remarkable of thoſe which have been held on the affairs of religion.—1. The diet of Augſburg, in the year 1530, was aſſembled to reunite the Princes of the empire, in relation to ſome religious matters; the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſided in this aſſembly with the greateſt magnificence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. The Elector of Saxony followed by ſeveral Princes, preſented the confeſſion of ſaith, called, The Confeſſion of Augſburg. The Emperor ended the diet with a decree, that no alteration ſhould be made in the doctrine and ceremonies of the Romiſh church, till a council ſhould order it otherwiſe.— 2. The diet of Augſburg, in 1547, was held on account of the Electors being divided concerning the deciſions of the council of Trent. The Emperor demanded, that the management of that affair ſhould be referred to him; and it was reſolved, that every one ſhould conform to the deciſions of the council—3. The diet of Augſburg, in 1548, was aſſembled to examine ſome memorials, relating to the Confeſſion of Faith; but the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners not agreeing together, the Emperor named three divines, who drew the deſign of that famous Interim, ſo well known in Germany, and elſewhere.—4. The diet of Augſburg, in 1550. In this aſſembly the Emperor complained, that the Interim was not obſerved, and demanded that all ſhould ſubmit to the council which they were going to renew at Trent, which ſubmiſſion was reſolſed upon by a plurality of votes.—5. The diet of Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg in 1523. Here Pope Adrian VI.'s nuncio demanded the execution of Leo X.'s bull, and Charles V.'s edict, againſt Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but the aſſembly drew up a liſt of grievances, which were reduced to an hundred articles; ſome whereof aime, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:421"/>of the Pope's authority, and the diſcipline of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church: however, they conſented that the Lutherans ſhould be commanded not to write againſt the Roman Catholics.— 6. The diet of Nuremberg, in 1524. In this aſſembly the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans having the advantage, it was decreed, that the Pope ſhould call a council in Germany; but that, in the mean time, an aſſembly ſhould be held at Spire, to determine what was to be believed and practiſed. But Charles V. prohibited the holding this aſſembly.—7. The diet of Ratiſbon, in 1541, was held for reuniting the Proteſtants with the Roman Catholics. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror named three Roman Catholics and three Proteſtant divines, to agree upon articles. The Roman Catholics were Julius Phlug, John Gropper, and John Eckius; and the Proteſtants were Philip Melanchton, Martin Bucer, and John Piſtorius: but after a whole month's conſultation, they could agree upon no more than five or ſix articles, which the Emperor conſented the Proteſtants ſhould retain, forbidding them to ſolicit any body to change the ancient religion.—8. The diet of Ratiſbon, in 1546, decreed, that the council of Trent was to be followed, which was oppoſed by the Proteſtant deputies, and this cauſed a war againſt them.—9. The diet of Ratiſbon, in 1557, demanded a conference between ſome famous doctors of both parties, which conference was held at Worms, in September, between twelve Roman Catholics, and twelve Lutheran divines; but was ſoon diſſolved by the Lutherant being divided among themſelves.—10. The diet of Spire, in 1526. In this aſſembly, wherein preſided the Archduke Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, the Duke of Saxony and the Landgrave of Heſſe demanded the free exerciſe of the Lutheran religion: upon which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the Emperor ſhould be deſired to call a general or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional council in Germany within a year, and that in the mean time every one ſhould have liberty of conſcience.—11. The diet of Spire, in 1529, decreed, that in the countries, which had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the new religion, it ſhould be lawful to continue in it till the next council; but that no Roman Catholic ſhould be allowed to turn Lutheran. Againſt this decree, ſix Lutheran Princes, viz. The Elector of Saxony, the Marquis of Brandenburg, the two Dukes of Lunenburg, the Landgrave of Heſſe, and the Prince of Anhalt, with the deputies of fourteen imperial towns, preteſted in writing, from which ſolemn proteſtation came the famous name of Proteſtants, which the Lutherans preſently after took.—12. The diet of Worms, in 1521. In this aſſembly Luther, being charged by the Pope's Nuncio with hereſy, and refuſing to recant, the Emperor, by his edict of May 26, before all the Princes of Germany, publickly outlawed him.</item>

It was deſigned to ſupply the place of the Liturgy, or Book of Common-Prayer, the uſe of which they had aboliſhed: it conſiſted of ſome general heads, which were to be managed and filled up at diſcretion, for it preſcribed no form of prayer or circumſtances of external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor obliged the people to any reſponſes, excepting Amen.— To give a ſhort abſtract of the Directory: It forbids all ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and civil ceremony, in the churches; the reading the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the congregation is declared to be part of the paſtoral office; all the canonical books of the Old and New Teſtament (but not of the Apocrypha) are to be publickly read in the vulgar tongue; how large a portion is to be read at once, is left to the miniſter, who has likewiſe the liberty of expounding when he judges it neceſſary. It preſcribes heads for the prayer before ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, among which, part of the prayer for the King is, to ſave him from evil council: it delivers rules for managing the ſermon; the introduction to the text muſt be ſhort and clear, drawn from the words, or context, or ſome parallel place of ſcripture; in dividing the text, the miniſter is to regard the order of the matter, more than that of the words; he is not to burthen the memory of his audience with too many diviſions, nor perplex their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings with logical phraſes and terms of art; he is not to ſtart unneceſſary objections, and he is to be very ſparing in citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from eccleſiaſtical or other human writers, ancient or modern. The Directory recommends the uſe of the Lord's Prayer, as the moſt perfect model of devotion; it forbids private or lay perſons to adminiſter baptiſm, and enjoins it to be performed in the face of the congregation; it orders the communion table, at the Lord's ſupper, to be ſo placed, that the communicants may ſit about it. The dead, according to the rules of the Directory, are to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without any prayers, or religious ceremony.</item>

                  <hi>Diſcipline</hi> (Eccleſiaſtical.) The Chriſtian church being a ſpiritual community or ſociety of perſons profeſſing the religion of Jeſus, and, as ſuch, governed by ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical laws, her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline conſiſts in putting thoſe laws in execution, and inflicting the penalties enjoined by them againſt ſeveral ſorts of offenders. To underſtand the true nature of church-diſcipline, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:423"/>how it ſtood in the ancient Chriſtian church. And, firſt, The primitive church never pretended to exerciſe diſcipline upon any, but ſuch as were within her pale, in the largeſt ſenſe, by ſome act of their own profeſſion, and even upon theſe ſhe never pretended to exerciſe her diſcipline ſo far as to cancel or diſannul their baptiſm; but the diſcipline of the church conſiſted in a power to deprive men of the benefits of external communion; ſuch as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic prayer, receiving the euchariſt, and other acts of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This power, before the eſtabliſhment of the church by human laws, was a mere ſpiritual authority, or, as St. Cyprian terms it, a ſpiritual ſword, affecting the ſoul, and not the body. Sometimes indeed the church craved aſſiſtance from the ſecular power, even when it was Heathen, but more frequently after it became Chriſtian: but it is to be obſerved, that the church never encouraged the magiſtrate to proceed againſt any one, for mere error, or eccleſiaſtical miſdemeanor, farther than to puniſh the delinquent by a pecuniary mulct, or bodily puniſhment, ſuch as a confiſcation or baniſhment. And St. Auſtin affirms, that no good men in the Catholic church were pleaſed, that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics ſhould be proſecuted unto death; leſſer puniſhments, they thought, might have their uſe, as a means ſometimes to bring them to conſideration and repentance; nor was it a part of the ancient diſcipline to deprive men of their natural or civil rights; a maſter did not loſe his authority over his family, a parent over his children, nor a magiſtrate his office or charge in the ſtate, by being caſt out of the church. But the diſcipline of the church being a mere ſpiritual power, was confined to, 1. Admonition of the offender. 2. The leſſer and greater excommunication.— As to the object of eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, they were all ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents as fell into great and ſcandalous crimes after baptiſm, whether men or women, prieſts or people, rich or poor, princes or ſubjects. That princes and magiſtrates fell under the church's cenſures, may be proved by ſeveral inſtances; particularly St. Chryſoſtom relates, that Babylas denied communion to one of the Roman Emperors, on account of a barbarous murder committed by him. St. Ambroſe likewiſe denied communion to Maximus, for ſhedding the blood of Gratian; and the ſame holy Biſhop abſolutely refuſed to admit the Emperor Theodoſius the Great into his church, notwithſtanding his humbleſt intreaties, becauſe he had inhumanly put to death ſeven thouſand men at Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, without diſtinguiſhing the innocent from the guilty.</item>

Thus Sir Edward Coke ſays, the King may not only found a church or free chapel donative, but may licence any ſubject to do the ſame. Secondly, Donatives may be grounded upon peculiar privilege; as, when a Lord of a manor, in a great pariſh, at a remote diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from his pariſh-church, offers to build and endow a church there, provided it ſhall entirely belong to him and his family, to put in what incumbent they ſhall think fit: the Biſhops, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch a work, may have permitted them to enjoy this liberty;

                  <hi>EASTER,</hi> a feſtival of the Chriſtian church, obſerved in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our Saviour's reſurrection. The Latins and others call it Paſcha, an Hebrew word, which ſignifies paſſage, and it is applied to the Jewiſh feaſt of the paſſover, to which the Chriſtian feſtival of Eaſter correſponds. This feſtival is called in Engliſh Eaſter, from the Saxon Eaſtre, an ancient goddeſs of that people, worſhipped with peculiar ceremonies in the month of April. Concerning the celebration of this feſtival, there were anciently very great diſputes in the church. Tho' all agreed in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it in general, yet they differed very much as to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time when it was to be obſerved; ſome keeping it preciſely on the ſame ſtated day every year, others on the fourteenth day of the firſt moon in the new year, whatever day of the week it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on; and others, on the firſt Sunday after the firſt full moon. This diverſity occaſioned a great diſpute in the 2d century, between the Aſiatic churches and the reſt of the world; in the courſe of which, Pope Victor excommunicated all thoſe churches: but the council of Nice, in the year 324, decreed, that all churches ſhould keep the Paſcha, or feſtival of Eaſter, on one and the ſame day, which is always on a Sunday. This decree was afterwards confirmed by the council of Antioch, in the year 344: yet this did not put an end to all diſputes concerning the obſervation of this feſtival; for it was not eaſy to determine on what Sunday it was to be held, becauſe, being a moveable feaſt, it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:426"/>that the churches of one country kept it a week or a month ſooner than other churches, by reaſon of their different calculations: therefore the council of Nice is ſaid to have decreed farther, that the Biſhops of Alexandria ſhould adjuſt a proper cycle, and inform the reſt of the world on what Sunday every year Eaſter was to be obſerved; notwithſtanding which the Roman and Alexandrian accounts continued to differ, and ſometimes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a week or a month from each other; and no effectual cure was found for this, till, in the year 525, Dionyſius Exiguus brought the Alexandrian canon or cycle entirely into uſe in the Roman church. Mean time, the churches of France and Britain kept to the old Roman canon; and it was two or three ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the new Roman, that is, the Alexandrian canon, not without ſome ſtruggle and difficulty, was ſettled among them.</item>

                  <hi>Ebionites,</hi> Chriſtian heretics, in the firſt century, ſo called from their leader Ebion. The Ebionites, as well as the Nazarenes, had their origin from the circumciſed Chriſtians, who had retired from Jeruſalem to Pella during the war between the Jews and Romans, and made their firſt appearance after the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, about the time of Domitian, or a little before. Ebion, the author of the hereſy of the Ebionites, was a diſciple of Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, and his ſucceſſor. He improved upon the errors of his maſter, and added to them new opinions of his own. He began his preaching in Judea; he taught in Aſia, and even at Rome; his tenets infected the iſle of Cyprus. St. John oppoſed both Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus and Ebion in Aſia; and it is thought that this Apoſtle wrote his goſpel in the year 97, particularly againſt this hereſy. The Ebionites held the ſame errors as the Nazarenes; they united the ceremonies of the law with the precepts of the goſpel; they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved both the Jewiſh Sabbath and the Chriſtian Sunday; they called their place of aſſembling a ſynagogue, and not a church; they bathed every day, which was the cuſtom of the Jews. In celebrating the euchariſt, they made uſe of unleavened bread, but no wine. They added to the obſervance of the law divers ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions; they adored Jeruſalem as the houſe of God. Like the Samaritans, they would not ſuffer a perſon of another religion to touch them; they abſtained from the fleſh of animals, and even from milk; and leſt any one ſhould object to them that paſſage of the goſpel where Jeſus ſays, he deſires to eat of the paſſover, they corrupted it. When they were ſick, or bitten by a ſerpent, they plunged themſelves into water, and invoked all ſorts of things to their aſſiſtance. They diſagreed among themſelves in relation to Chriſt: ſome of them ſaid he was born, like other men, of Joſeph and Mary, and acquired ſanctification only by his good works; others of them allowed that he was born of a virgin, but denied that he was the Word of God, or had a pre-exiſtence before his human generation: they ſaid he was indeed the only true prophet, but yet a mere man, who by his virtue had arrived
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:427"/>at being called Chriſt, and the Son of God. They ſuppoſed that Chriſt and the devil were two principles, which God had oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the one to the other. Though the Ebionites obſerved the law, yet they differed from the Jews in many points. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſanctity of Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, Aaron, and Joſhua; but they laughed at all thoſe who came after them: they rejected ſome parts of the Pentateuch; and when they were too cloſely preſſed by this book, they entirely abandoned it. Of the New Teſtament they acknowledge only the goſpel of St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew; that is, that which was written in Hebrew, and which they called the goſpel according to the Hebrews; but they took from it the two firſt chapters, and corrupted other paſſages of it. They abſolutely rejected St. Paul, as an apoſtate, and an enemy of the law, and publiſhed ſeveral calumnies againſt him. They had likewiſe falſe Acts of the Apoſtles, in which they mixed a great many fables. As to their manner of life, they imitated the Carpocratians, the moſt infamous of all heretics. They rejected virginity and continence; they obliged children to marry very young; they allowed married perſons to ſeparate from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and marry again as often as they pleaſed. St. Juſtin, St. Irenaeus, and Origen, wrote againſt the Ebionites. Symmachus, author of one of the Greek verſions of the ſcriptures, was an Ebionite.</item>

Solomon, who is the author of this book, deſcribes himſelf in the very firſt verſe, in theſe words: "The words of <hi>Coheleth,</hi> the Son of David, King of Jeruſalem."

                  <hi>Elders,</hi> among the Jews, were perſons the moſt conſiderable for age, experience, and wiſdom.

<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:428"/>Chriſtians, thoſe who held the firſt place or rank had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the denomination of elders.

                  <hi>Ember-Weeks,</hi> or <hi>Days,</hi> in the Chriſtian church. They are certain ſeaſons of the year ſet apart for the imploring God's bleſſing, by prayer and faſting, upon the ordinations performed in the church at ſuch times; and this in conformity to the practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who, when they ſeparated perſons for the work of the miniſtry, prayed and faſted before they laid their hands on them. Theſe ordination-faſts are obſerved four times in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wedneſday, Friday, and Saturday, after the firſt Sunday in Lent, after Whitſunday, after the 14th of September, and after the 13th of December; it being injoined by a canon of the church, that deacons and miniſters be ordained or made only upon the Sundays immediately following theſe Ember-faſts. Some derive the term <hi>Ember</hi> from a German word, which ſignifies abſtinence; others from one which ſignifies aſhes, becauſe it was cuſtomary with the ancients to accompany their faſtings with ſprinkling of aſhes, or ſitting upon them. Dr. Mareſchal derives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Ember-weeks were formerly obſerved in different churches with ſome variety, but were at laſt ſettled, as they are now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, by the council of Placentia, A. D. 1095. St. Auouſtin, who lived in the fifth century, ſpeaks of the Ember-faits, but mentions them only as obſerved in the dioceſe of Rome; from whence we may conclude, that the obſervation of them was not at that time general in the church. The council of Mentz, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by Charlemagne in 813, mentions the Ember weeks as a new eſtabliſhment introduced in France, in conformity to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man church.</item>

                  <p>Of enthuſiaſts, particularly in religion, ſuch high pretenders having given up themſelves to their own fancy and imagination, without any fixed principles that can bind them, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to feel ſome very warm emotions in their minds, which are always apprehended to come immediately from heaven, and which they always regard as ſymbols of the divine preſence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing tokens of his peculiar love and favour towards them, they cannot but entertain an extravagant conceit of their own worth and excellency, as if they were the beloved, the peculiar people, to whom he hath revealed himſelf in ſo extraordinary a manner; and thus viewing themſelves in high favour with the Deity, from which they believe the reſt of mankind are excluded. Hence thoſe viſionaries have their minds always turned, in their gloomy manner, to contemplate God and heavenly things, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the high ſtation to which they vainly think they are exalted in the divine grace and favour; and with this ſullen frame of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which is continually hanging about them, do they ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualiſe and ſanctify all things whatſoever, even the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities and the blackeſt villainies, according as they happen to ſuit their particular temper and circumſtances: for thoſe conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beings are ſo far from ſubmitting themſelves to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon, that they look upon this DIM LIGHT, as they are pleaſed to call it, and all its fixed principles, and every ſtated rule whatſoever, eſpecially ſuch as are of human authority, to be fit only for common ſervile ſouls, and much below the notice of thoſe who have immediate acceſs to the fountain of all light, and who diſtinctly perceives all the meaſures of their behaviour in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural revelations; and when they have a ſtrong inclination to indulge, they do not conſult and hearken to the dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; they go to God with it, and lay the matter before the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:430"/>as they are uſed to ſpeak in their familiar manner, to implore his light and direction, and loudly call for an anſwer. Now, in their opinion, a favourable anſwer to prayer conſiſts in divine joys and raptures, that ſeize upon the ſoul, and make it ſenſible of the immediate preſence and countenance of God; ſo that till they find ſomething of this nature ſpringing up within them, and warming and agitating their breaſt, they fancy to have received no return from heaven; and therefore they do ſtill inſiſt, and with great importunity do they labour, till they wreſtle themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe mechanical heats and emotions which they take for a gracious anſwer to their prayers. This may be farther deſcribed by an extract from a little diary annexed to ſome letters publiſhed in 1757, ſaid to be wrote by Mrs. Le Fevre, and by ſome thought ſcarcely to be paralleled for piety.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:431"/>in the univerſe; but this unworthineſs will the more magnify thy mercy. I have only my unworthineſs to plead, and I have no hope but in thine atoning blood. Oh! let this blood, which has bought my peace, cleanſe me alſo from every ſin; and let that bleſſed Spirit, who has ſealed and witneſſed this peace to my ſoul, cleanſe me from every ſin, and ſo purify me even as— Oh! glorious proſpect, heart-enlivening hopes, let me ſink into the duſt before thee! God of glory, God of purity, I am loſt in ſelf-abaſement; but haſt thou not promiſed, and wilt thou not fulfil thine own gracious word? Oh! give me then perfect ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of body, ſoul, and ſpirit,—and let every bitter cup which thou permitteſt to be given me, be joyfully received, as ſerving, in ſome degree, to conform me to thy ſuffering; and let me in all things, though ever ſo contrary to my corrupt nature, give thanks, and ſay continually, "Lord, not my will, but thine be done. Amen."</p>

"Immediate revelation being a more eaſy way for men to eſtabliſh their opinions, and regulate their conduct, than the tedious, and not always ſucceſsful, labour of reaſoning, it is no wonder that ſome have been very apt to pretend to revelation, and to perſuade themſelves, that they are under the peculiar guidance of heaven in their actions and opinions, eſpecially in thoſe of them which they cannot account for by the ordinary methods of knowledge and principles of reaſon. Hence we ſee, that in all ages, men, in whom melancholy has mixed with devotion, or whoſe conceit of themſelves has raiſed them into an opinion of a great familiarity with God, and a nearer admittance to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than is afforded to others, have often flattered themſelves with a perſuaſion of an immediate intercourſe with the Deity, and frequent communications from the divine Spirit. Their minds being thus prepared, whatever groundleſs opinion comes to ſettle itſelf ſtrongly upon then fancies, is an illumination from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and preſently of divine authority, and whatſoever odd action they find in themſelves a ſtrong inclination to do, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe is concluded to be a call or direction from heaven, and muſt be obeyed; it is a commiſſion from above, and they cannot err in executing it.

                  <hi>Epiphany,</hi> a Chriſtian feſtival, otherwiſe called the manifeſtation of Chriſt to the Gentiles. It is obſerved on the 6th of January.— The Gentiles, to whom our Saviour on this day manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were the Magi, or, as we render the word, wiſe men, whoſe viſit and preſents to the infant Jeſus are recorded by St. Matthew. There are ſeveral queſtions in relation to this whole tranſaction; as, firſt, what that ſtar was which is ſaid to have directed the wiſe men in their journey? That it was not in reality a ſtar, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe it went before them, and ſtood over where the young child was, which could not be true of any one of the heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It muſt therefore be a luminous appearance, or ſeeming ſtar in the lower region of the air, obſerved by the wiſe men to differ from the ordinary ſtars of heaven, which, as a new and prodigious ſight, ſeemed to them to preſage ſomething of great moment and conſideration. Some authors have ſuggeſted, that this ſeeming ſtar which appeared to the wiſe men in the Eaſt, might be that glorious light which ſhone upon the ſhepherds of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem when the angels came to impart to them the tidings of our Saviour's birth, and which, at a diſtance, might appear like a ſtar. Another queſtion is, how the wiſe men could gueſs at the birth of our Saviour from the appearance of this ſtar? The moſt probable anſwer is, that they did not collect the birth of Jeſus Chriſt from this uncommon appearance (which only ſerved as their guide in finding him out) but were determined to their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by the general expectation the eaſtern world was then in of an univerſal monarch. The feaſt of Epiphany was not originally a diſtinct feſtival, but made a part of that of the nativity of Chriſt, which being celebrated twelve days, the firſt and laſt of which, according to the cuſtom of the Jews, in their feaſts, were high or chief days of this ſolemnity; either of theſe might be fitly called Epiphany, as that word ſignifies the appearance of Chriſt in the world.</item>

"The ſelf-exiſtent Being (ſays the learned Dr. Clarke) muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be eternal. The ideas of eternity and ſelf-exiſtence are ſo cloſely connected, that becauſe ſomething of neceſſity muſt be eternal, independently, and without any outward cauſe of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore it muſt neceſſarily be ſelf-exiſtent; and becauſe it is impoſſible but ſomething muſt be ſelf-exiſtent, therefore it is neceſſary that it muſt likewiſe be eternal. To be ſelf-exiſtent, is to exiſt by an abſolute neceſſity in the nature of the thing itſelf; now this neceſſity being abſolute, and not depending upon any thing eternal, muſt be always unalterably the ſame, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alterable but what is capable of being affected by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what without itſelf. That Being therefore, which has no other cauſe of its exiſtence, but the abſolute neceſſity of its own nature, muſt of neceſſity have exiſted from everlaſting without end.—As to the manner of this eternal exiſtence, it is manifeſt, it herein infinitely tranſcends the manner of the exiſtence of all created beings, even of ſuch as ſhall exiſt for ever, that whereas it is not poſſible for their finite minds to comprehend all that is paſt, or to underſtand perfectly all the things that are preſent, much leſs to know all that is future, or to have entirely in their power any thing that is to come; but their thoughts, knowledge, and power, muſt of neceſſity have degrees and periods, and be ſucceſſive and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as the things themſelves. The eternal, ſupreme Cauſe, on the contrary, muſt of neceſſity have ſuch a perfect independent unchangeable comprehenſion of all things, that there can be no one point or inſtant of his eternal duration, wherein all things that are paſt, preſent, and to come, will not be as entirely known, and repreſented to him, in one ſingle thought or view, and all things preſent and future be equally and entirely in his power and direction, as if there was no ſucceſſion at all, but all things were actually preſent at once.</item>

He pretended that the divine nature, by its ſuperiority, had ſo entirely ſwallowed up the human, that the latter could not be diſtinguiſhed in Jeſus Chriſt; inſomuch, that, according to Eutyches, Jeſus Chriſt was merely God, that he had nothing of humanity but the appearance. Flavian, Patriarch of Conſtantinople, ſtrongly oppoſed this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and Eutyches was condemned in a council held in 448: which ſentence was confirmed by the general council of Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in 451.

                  <hi>Faſts,</hi> days of religious abſtinence. Such ſolemnities have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all ages and nations, eſpecially in times of mourning and affliction. We meet with no examples of faſting, properly ſo called, before Moſes, who yet enjoins no other than the ſolemn day of expiation, which was generally and ſtrictly obſerved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſolemn faſt of expiation, inſtituted by divine authority, the Jews appointed certain times of faſting and humiliation, called
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:437"/>the faſts of the congregation. But, beſides the public faſts, which the Jews were obliged by their law to obſerve, there were others of a private nature, which the zealous and moſt pious among them preſcribed to themſelves. The common way of faſting among the Jews is, to take no food, nor any drink, from the foregoing evening till ſun-ſet the day following. They are allowed ſome particular herbs and butter, but not eggs. They muſt not be ſhaved, or powdered, or bathe themſelves. They eſteem faſting as a ſupplement to the old ſacrifices, and place great merit in it. The ancient Chriſtians had two ſorts of ſolemn faſts, the one weekly, the other annual. Their weekly faſts, called <hi>jejunia quartae &amp; ſextae feriae,</hi> were obſerved on Wedneſdays and Fridays; becauſe on Wedneſday our Lord was betrayed by Judas, and on Friday crucified by the Jews. Theſe faſts laſted till the ninth hour, that is, till three o'clock in the afternoon, at which time they received the euchariſt. They called theſe faſts ſtations, and the remains of them are yet obſerved in our church, which by her 15th canon has ordained, that tho' Wedneſdays and Fridays be not holy days, yet that weekly, upon thoſe times, the miniſter and people ſhall reſort to church, at the accuſtomed hour of prayer. Their annual faſt was that of Lent. They had likewiſe their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional faſts, obſerved at extraordinary and unuſual ſeaſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the variety and neceſſity of their circumſtances required. Such were, times of great and imminent danger, either to the church or ſtate, and times of public calamities, as plague or perſecution. Theſe occaſional faſts were appointed by the Biſhops of every church as they thought fit: they were called, by way of eminence, <hi>Jejunia.</hi> The Greeks have four ſolemn faſts: the firſt commences on the 15th of November, or forty days before Chriſtmas; it is obſerved in commemoration of Moſes's faſting forty days on Mount Sinai: the ſecond falls in with our Lent: the third is called the faſt of the holy Apoſtles, which they obſerve upon a ſuppoſition that the Apoſtles prepared themſelves by prayer and faſting for the promulgation of the goſpel. This faſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences the week after Whitſuntide, and continues till the feſtival of St. Peter and St. Paul. Their fourth faſt commences the firſt of Auguſt, and laſts until the 15th. The Greeks are ſo ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and extravagant in the obſervation of their faſts, that they will admit of no caſes of neceſſity ſufficient to juſtify a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Patriarch himſelf cannot authoriſe any perſon to eat meat when the church has enjoined the contrary. The Romaniſts diſtinguiſh between faſting and abſtinence, and different days are appointed for each of them in that church. On their days of faſting they are allowed but one meal in twenty-four hours; but on days of abſtinence, provided they abſtain from fleſh, and make but a moderate meal, they are indulged in a collation at night. The times of faſting, appointed by that church, are all Lent, except Sundays, the Ember days, the vigils of the more

Their days of abſtinence are, all the Sundays in Lent, St. Mark's day, if it does not fall in Eaſter week, the three Rogation days, all Saturdays throughout the year, with the Fridays before excepted, unleſs either happens to be Chriſtmas-day. The church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, tho' it appoints days of faſting and abſtinence, for it makes no diſtinction between them, does not determine what food is proper for ſuch ſeaſons; and there is a ſtatute, which declares, that whoſoever, by preaching, teaching, writing, &amp;c. affirms it to be neceſſary to abſtain from fleſh, for the ſaving of the ſoul of man, or for the ſervice of God, is to be puniſhed as a ſpreader of falſe news: but notwithſtanding this, the church declares in one of her homilies, that faſting, by the decree of the 630 fathers, aſſembled at the council of Chalcedon, which was one of the firſt four general councils, who grounded their determinations upon the ſacred ſcriptures, and long continued uſage or practice both of the prophets and other godly perſons, before the coming of Chriſt, and alſo of the Apoſtles, and other devout men, in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a withholding meat, drink, and all natural food, from the body, for the determined time of faſting.

                  <hi>Feaſts.</hi> God, in his great wiſdom, appointed ſeveral feſtivals among the Jews: 1. To perpetuate the memory of theſe great events and wonders which he had wrought in favour of his people. 2. To keep them firm to their religion. 3. To encourage them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of reſt and pleaſure; for their feſtivals were accompanied with rejoicings, with feaſts of charity, and with innocent diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. 4. For inſtruction; for at thoſe times there were ſeaſons when the law of God was read and explained. 5. To renew and confirm their acquaintance and friendſhip with their tribes. The Hebrews had a great number of feaſts, as the Sabbath, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical year, the Paſſover, the feaſt of Pentecoſt, of Trumpets, of New-moons, of Expiation, of Tabernacles, and occaſional, as that at the dedication of the Temple, &amp;c.</item>

                  <hi>Feaſts</hi> or <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> days of religious feaſting. Such ſolemnities have obtained in every age and nation.—Feſtivals among the ancient Grecians were inſtituted upon various accounts. Firſt, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the gods, eſpecially if they had conferred any ſignal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on the public, or on private perſons. Secondly, in order to procure ſome eſpecial favour from the gods; or to appeaſe their anger, in times of public calamity. Thirdly, in memory of deceaſed friends, or of thoſe who had done any remarkable ſervice to, or died valiantly in defence of, their country. Fourthly, at a time of eaſe and reſt from their labour. In the ancient Chriſtian church, beſides the feſtivals, which peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to our Lord's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:439"/>Eaſter, Pentecoſt, &amp;c.) there was another ſort inſtituted by the church, in honour of the apoſtles and martyrs. The firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of theſe feſtivals is not certainly known, but learned men commonly carry it as high as the ſecond century. Theſe they called their natalitia or birth-days, meaning not their natural birth, but a glorious crown in the kingdom of Heaven. They were celebrated at the graves or monuments of the martyrs, and were moſtly confined to thoſe particular churches where the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs lay buried; for which reaſon it was cuſtomary for every church to have its particular faſti or kalendar of martyrs, in which was a diſtinct narrative of the acts and ſufferings of each martyr, and theſe acts and ſufferings were commonly read in the church on the anniverſary, commemoration and proper feſtival of the martyr. To theſe they commonly added a panegyrical oration, or ſermon, on the virtue of the martyr. They obſerved the virgil or eve of theſe feſtivals, with pſalmody and prayer, till break of day.—Another ſort of feſtivals, obſerved by the ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were annual thankſgiving days, for favours and bleſſings vouchſafed by God to his church. Thus the church of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria kept an anniverſary thankſgiving on the twenty-firſt of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their deliverance from a terrible earthquake, in the reign of Julian; among theſe we may reckon the thankſgivings for ſignal victories of the Emperors, which generally laſted no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the life of the Emperor on whoſe account they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.—In the Romiſh church, there are double feaſts, half double, and ſimple feaſts. The name of double feaſts was given to thoſe whoſe ſervice is fuller and more ſolemn than the reſt; the other denominations took their riſe from ſingular reaſons, the chief difference between them being the greater or leſs ſolemnity uſed in them. The churches are eſtabliſhed, and the altars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned according to the rank each ſaint holds in his reſpective church; all high feſtivals have an octave, conſiſting of the feaſt itſelf, and the ſeven following days.—In Italy, certain feſtivals are celebrated which occur only in the kalendar of the lovers of that country: to underſtand this, you are to know, that when a lover is deſirous of giving his miſtreſs the higheſt teſtimonies of his gallantry, he immediately makes her the idol of his devotion; he has veſpers, and even maſſes ſaid in her honour: for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he makes choice of ſome ſaint whoſe name ſhe bears, and, tho' the ſaint has the name, they manage matters ſo, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the feſtival is plainly relative to the lover's miſtreſs.— When, upon the reformation, the liturgy of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was ſettled, the obſervation of feſtivals was enjoined by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtatutes, which were revived in the firſt year of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, and continued in the firſt year of King James; and when, upon the reſtoration, King Charles iſſued out a commiſſion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the liturgy, the alterations made in it were ſynodically a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

Pope Urban's bull for this feſtival was not every where obeyed. Afterwards, at the general council of Vienne, in 1311, under Pope Clement V. the Kings of England, France, and Arragon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, this bull was confirmed, and ordered to be every where obſerved.

                  <hi>Gnoſtics,</hi> a ſect of Chriſtians in the firſt and ſecond centuries, who arrogated to themſelves a high degree of knowledge, and looked upon all other Chriſtians, in compariſon of them, to be ſimple and ignorant. St. Irenaeus ſuppoſes that St. Paul greatly reflects upon this ſectary in his epiſtle to Timothy, which may be the reaſon why theſe epiſtles were in after-time rejected by them. Some imagine they proceeded from Simon Magus, and from this root they branched into various other ſects, as Valentinians, Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Baſilidians, Marcienites, Colobarſian, &amp;c. One thing, in juſtice to truth, is obſervable, and whoever impartially examines the fathers portraiture of theſe ancient hereſies, will find there the firſt ſeeds and elements of thoſe controverſies which ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the peace of the church for ſeveral centuries: and indeed it could be wiſhed the chief patrons of ſome doctrines, which our firſt reformers either ſtarted themſelves, or brought with them out of the Romiſh church, would carefully examine St. Irenaeus, were it only to ſee under what claſs that ancient writer would have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, whether within the pale of the primitive church, or among the errors which ſhe unanimouſly exploded; and indeed I muſt refer the reader to that author for a full account of them. Their principal tenets are, firſt, the notion of the <hi>probolae,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal productions, by which they meant ſomething originally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding within the eſſence of God, and formed by him into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct perſonal ſubſtance from him; a doctrine not only inconſiſtent with the ſimplicity and immutability of the divine nature, but which alſo is attended with this manifeſt contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuppoſing one and the ſame eſſence to be both derived and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, ſelf-exiſtent and begotten. Anaximander (ſays this ancient father, and meaning the Pagan philoſopher ſo called) affirmed that which is immenſe to be the father of all things, containing, after a ſeminal manner, within himſelf the production of all. This notion they have borrowed from him, and applied to their <hi>Bithus</hi> or <hi>Aeons,</hi> i. e. to their ſupreme Father, and the whole ſyſtem of divine perſonages derived from him; and, on the ſame principle, they attempted to explain the production of the animal and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial world, not by God's creating it out of nothing, for this Valentinius denied, but by ſome flux or emanation of ſubſtance or paſſion from one of their Aeons. In much the ſame way they accounted for the origin of moral good and evil, not by founding them wholly on the will of the free agent, but in his ſubſtance or nature, made up (it ſeems) of certain qualities originally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in him, qualities in which his own conſent and will was not the leaſt concerned, as being coeval with his exiſtence, and, as I before obſerved, interwoven with his very nature. From hence came the <hi>Coſmocrater</hi> or diabolic power, and (to uſe their phraſeology) the whole ſpiritual ſubſtance of wickedneſs: and from hence, 3dly, deſcending lower (I mean to the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) they divided it into the material, animal, and ſpiritual.
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:444"/>The firſt claſs, whoſe ſouls were of much the ſame kind with that of the brutes, they affirmed, was abſolutely incapable of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and accordingly they abſolutely denied the reſurrection of the body, and affirmed that the ſouls departed were immediately conveyed beyond the ſeventh heaven, and admitted to the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic viſion of God. The ſecond were candidates for happineſs, and were trained up for it by faith and good works; and under this diviſion, ſays Irenaeus, they place us who are of the church; for which reaſon, they ſay, a good life or practice is neceſſary for us abſolutely ſo; but as for themſelves, that they ſhall be ſaved, not by practice, but being by nature ſpiritual, and having the ſeeds of election. They aſſert in relation to our Saviour, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the firſt-fruits of whatever he intended to ſave. Accordingly he aſſumed both a ſoul and ſpirit, as belonging to the ſecond and third claſs; but they abſolutely denied his aſſuming any thing material, or a body of the ſame kind as ours. This ſoul they called the animal Chriſt, in contradiſtinction from the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage that came down from heaven; and it was this animal Chriſt, or human ſoul, and not the Saviour from above, which ſuffered for us. They had other ſtrange opinions, and they have gone through different forms and characters in a long ſeries of time, though it is in the main the ſame, and what moſt of the hereſies of former times may be in good meaſure deduced from, of which the reader will be in ſome meaſure ſatisfied by ſearching into the tenets of the Valentinians, Homouſans, Montaniſts, Originiſm, &amp;c.

"God (ſays Sir Iſaac Newton) is a relative term, and has reſpect to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. It denotes indeed an eternal, infinite, abſolutely perfect being; but ſuch a being, without dominion, would not be God. The word God frequently ſignifies Lord, but every Lord is not God. The dominion of a ſpiritual being, or Lord, conſtitutes God, true dominion, true God, the ſupreme ſupreme, pretended pretended. From ſuch true dominion it follows, that the true God is living, intelligent, and powerful; and from his other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that he is ſupreme, or ſupremely perfect. He is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omniſcient; that is, he endures from eternity to eternity, and is preſent from infinity to infinity; he governs all things that exiſt, and knows all things that are to be known; he is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite; he is not duration of ſpace, but he endures and is preſent; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures always, and is preſent every where; and by exiſting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and every where, conſtitutes the very things we call dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſpace, eternity and infinity: he is omnipreſent, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtually, but ſubſtantially; for power without ſubſtance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:445"/>ſubſiſt. All things are contained, and more in him, but without any mutual paſſion; that is, he ſuffers nothing from the motion of bodies, nor do they undergo any reſiſtance from his omnipreſence. It is confeſſed, that God exiſts neceſſarily, and by the ſame neceſſity he exiſts always and every where. Hence he muſt be always ſimilar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all perception, intelligence, and action; but after a manner not at all corporeal, not at all like men, after a manner altogether unknown to us. He is deſtitute of all body and bodily ſhape, and therefore cannot be ſeen, heard, or touched, nor ought to be worſhipped under the repreſentation of any thing corporeal. We know him only by his properties or attributes, by the moſt wiſe and excellent ſtructure of things, and by final cauſes; but we adore and worſhip him only on account of his dominion; for God, ſetting aſide dominion, providence, and final cauſes, is nothing elſe but fate and nature."—The exiſtence of ſuch a being, or firſt cauſe of all things, is thus beautifully proved and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the ingenious author of The Religion of Nature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated.

A chain of ten links would fall down, unleſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing able to bear it hindered; one of twenty, if not ſtaid by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of yet greater ſtrength, in proportion to the increaſe of weight; and therefore one of infinite links certainly, if not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſomething infinitely ſtrong, and capable to bear an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite weight. And thus it is in a chain of cauſes and effects, tending, or, as it were, gravitating towards ſome end. The laſt or loweſt depends, or (as one may ſay) is ſuſpended upon the cauſe above it; this again, if it be not the firſt cauſe, is ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an effect of ſomething above it, &amp;c. and if they ſhould be infinite, unleſs (agreeably to what has been ſaid) there is ſome cauſe upon which all hang or depend, they would be but an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite effect, without an efficient; and to aſſert there is any ſuch thing, would be as great an abſurdity as to ſay, a finite or little weight wants ſomething to ſuſtain it, but an infinite one, or the greateſt, does not."</item>

                  <hi>Good Friday,</hi> a faſt of the Chriſtian church, in memory of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and death of Jeſus Chriſt. It is obſerved on the Friday in holy or paſſion week, and it is called, by way of eminence, <hi>good,</hi> becauſe of the bleſſed effects of our Saviour's ſufferings, which were a propitratory or explating ſacrifice for the ſins of the world. The commemoration of our Saviour's ſufferings has been
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:446"/>kept from the very firſt ages of Chriſtianity, and was always obſerved as a day of the ſtricteſt faſting and humiliation. Among the Saxons it was called Long-Friday; but for what reaſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on account of the long faſtings and offices then uſed, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. On Good Friday, the Pope ſits on a plain form, and, after ſervice is ended, when the Cardinals wait on him back to his chamber, they are obliged to keep a deep ſilence, as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their ſorrow. In the night of Good Friday, the Greeks perform the obſequies of our Saviour round a great crucifix laid on a bed of ſtate adorned with flowers. Theſe the Biſhops diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute among the aſſiſtants when the office is ended.

This hiſtory is contained in the writings of St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and St. John, who from thence are ſtiled Evangeliſts.

                  <hi>Heaven,</hi> without defining, is ſo well known a word, that I begin this article by obſerving, that heaven was the firſt object of falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

The Pagans conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered heaven as the reſidence only of the celeſtial gods, and into which no mortals, after death, were admitted, unleſs they had been firſt deified, or made gods; as for the ſouls of men, they were conſigned to the Elyſian fields. The Hebrews acknowledged three heavens: the firſt, the aerial heaven, where the birds fly, the winds blow, and the ſhowers are formed: the ſecond, the heaven or firmament, wherein the ſtars are diſpoſed: the third, the heaven of heavens, the place of God's reſidence, and where the ſaints and angels dwell. This third heaven is mentioned by St. Paul, in the account which he gives of his rapture. Juvenal ignorantly accuſes the Jews of paying divine adoration to the viſible heaven.</item>

                  <hi>Heretics,</hi> the general name of ſuch perſons under any religion, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Chriſtian, as maintain or teach opinions in religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the orthodox, or eſtabliſhed faith. The term hereſy is of Greek original, and ſignifies option, choice, or ſect, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the voluntary choice a man makes of doctrines, ſuppoſed to be contrary to the true faith. Hereſies began very early in the Chriſtian church: Euſebius fixes the beginning of moſt of them to the reign of the Emperor Adrian; and yet it is certain, that Simon Magus had publiſhed his errors before that time, and ſet up a ſect, which gave riſe to moſt of the ancient hereſies. The laws both of the church and ſtate were very ſevere againſt thoſe who were adjudged to be heretics. Thoſe of the ſtates, made by the Chriſtian Emperors from the time of Conſtantine, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under one title, <hi>De Hereticis,</hi> in the Theodoſian Code. The principal of them are, firſt, the general note of infamy affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all heretics in common. Secondry, all commerce forbidden to be held with them. Thirdly, the depriving them of all offices of profit and dignity. Fourthly, the diſqualifying them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their eſtates, by will, or receive eſtates from others. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the impoſing on them pecuniary mulcts. Sixth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, the proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and baniſhing them. Seventhly, the inflicting corporal puniſhment on them, ſuch as ſcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, &amp;c. before baniſhment. Beſides theſe laws, which chiefly affected the perſons of heretics, there were ſeveral others which tended to the extirpation of hereſy; ſuch as, firſt thoſe which forbad heretical teachers to propagate their doctrines publickly or privately. Secondly, thoſe which forbad heretics to hold public diſputations. Thirdly, ſuch laws as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited all heretical meetings and aſſemblies. Thirdly, thoſe which deny to the children of heretical parents their patrimony and inheritance, unleſs they returned to the church: and, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch laws as ordered the books of heretics to be burned. There were many other penal laws made againſt heretics, from the time of Conſtantine to Theodoſius, jun. and Valentinian III. but the few already mentioned, may be ſufficient to give an idea of the rigour with which the empire treated ſuch perſons, as held, or taught opinions contrary to the faith of the Catholic church; whoſe diſcipline towards heretics was no leſs ſevere than the civil laws. For, firſt, the church was uſed to pronounce a formal ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, or excommunication, againſt them. Thus the council of Nice ends her creed with an anathema againſt all thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the doctrine there delivered, and there are innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this kind to be found in the volumes of the councils. Secondly, ſome canons debarred them from the very loweſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of church-communion, forbidding them to enter into the church, ſo much as to hear the ſermon, or the ſcriptures read in the ſervice of the catechumens: but this was no general rule, for liberty was often granted to heretics to be preſent at the ſermons, in hopes of their converſion; and the hiſtorians tell us, that
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:449"/>Chryſoſtom, by this means, brought over many to acknowledge the divinity of Chriſt, whilſt they had liberty to come and hear his ſermons. Thirdly, the church prohibited all perſons, under pain of excommunication, to join with heretics in any religious offices. Fourthly, by the laws of the church, no one was to eat or converſe familiarly with heretics, or to read their writings, or to contract affinity with them; their names were to be ſtruck out of the Diptyches, or ſacred regiſters of the church; and, if they died in hereſy, no pſalmody, or other ſolemnity, was to be uſed at their funerals. Fifthly, the teſtimony of heretics was notto be taken in any eccleſiaſtical cauſe whatſoever. Theſe are the chief eccleſiaſtical laws againſt heretics. As to the terms of penance impoſed upon relenting heretics, or ſuch as were willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their errors, and to be reconciled to the church, they were various, and differed according to the canons of different councils, or the uſage of different churches. The council of Eliberis appoints ten years penance before repenting heretics are admitted to communion. The council of Agde contracted this term into that of three years. The council of Epone reduced it to two years only. The ancient Chriſtian church made a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch heretics as contumaciouſly reſiſted the admonitions of the church, and ſuch as never had any admonition given them; for none were reputed formal heretics, or treated as ſuch, till the church had given them a firſt and ſecond admonition, according to the Apoſtles rule. The Romiſh church is very rigorous in her treatment of thoſe perſons, whom ſhe deems to be heretics, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe countries where the inquiſition prevails. There the utmoſt ſeverities of impriſonment, racks, and tortures of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhapes, are employed againſt them; and if the civil magiſtrate, whoſe aſſiſtance they implore when the puniſhment is capital, ſhould go about to mitigate it, he himſelf would be ſuſpected of favouring heretics, and would run the riſk of excommunication. There is no expreſs law in England, which determines what ſhall be called hereſy. It is true, the ſtatute 1 Elizabeth, cap. i. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the high commiſſion court to reſtrain the ſame, to what had been adjudged to be ſo by the authority of the ſcriptures, or by the firſt four general councils, or to what ſhould be determined to be ſuch by parliament, the convocation aſſenting. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, or Biſhop of any dioceſe, has, by the common law, power to convict perſons of hereſy: the convocation may declare what tenets are heretical. Hereſy was, anciently, treaſon; and the puniſhment for it was burning, by virtue of the writ, <hi>De here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico comburendo;</hi> but the heretic forfeited neither lands nor goods, becauſe the proceedings againſt him were <hi>pro ſalute animi.</hi> By ſtatute 29 Car. II. cap. ix. the proceedings on ſuch writ, and all puniſhments by death, in purſuance of eccleſiaſtical cenſures, are taken away; but an obſtinate heretic, being excommunicated, is liable to be impriſoned by virtue of the writ <hi>de excommunicatio

Thoſe, ſays St. Jerom, who interpret ſcripture to any ſenſe repugnant to that of the Holy Spirit, tho' they ſhould never withdraw themſelves from the church, yet may be juſtly called heretics.</item>

There is alſo at preſent a diviſion among the latter, who have two rival Patriarchs, one of whom reſides at Caramit, and the other at Derizapharan. As to their belief, they are Monophyſites; that is, they hold but one nature in Jeſus Chriſt, which was the ſentiment of Dioſcorus.

With reſpect to purgatory, and prayers for the dead, they are of the ſame opinion with the Greeks, and the other Eaſtern Chriſtians.

Some commands of God are impoſſible to righteous men, even tho' they endeavour with all their powers to accompliſh them, the grace being wanted by which they ſhould be able to perform them. II.

The Semipelagians admitted the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of inward preventing grace to each act in particular, and even to the beginning of faith; but held they were heretics, in regard they aſſerted this grace was ſuch, as that the will of man might either reſiſt or obey it.

                  <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> a moſt famous religious order in the Romiſh church. Their founder was Inigo or Ignatius Loyola, who was born, in 1491, in the province of Guipuſcoa, in Spain. He was bred up in the court of Ferdinand, King of Spain. In his youth he diſcovered a martial diſpoſition, and ſignaliſed himſelf in the ſiege of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona, where he was wounded, and taken priſoner by the French. During his confinement and illneſs, he read ſome books of piety, which occaſioned his firſt reſolution of devoting himſelf wholly to God. As ſoon as he was cured, he undertook a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to our Lady of Montſerrat in Catalonia, where he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated himſelf to the Virgin, and took a reſolution to travel to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. It is believed he here wrote his Spiritual Exerciſes, which he afterwards publiſhed at Rome in 1548. He arrived at Jeruſalem, Sept. 4, 1523, where he viſited the holy places, and performed all the pious exerciſes of a pilgrim. Being returned to Spain, he began to ſtudy grammar at Barcelona, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went through his courſes of philoſophy and divinity at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala. Ignatius had then four companions, who were all cloathed like himſelf in a brown woollen habit, and applied themſelves to the ſame exerciſes. His ſame increaſing, the number of thoſe who came to hear his inſtructions increaſed likewiſe. This giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing umbrage to the inquiſitors of the city of Alcala, he was taken up, and impriſoned, by order of the Grand Vicar, but was ſoon releaſed, with an injunction to go cloathed like the other ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and to abſtain from talking to the people concerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, till he had ſtudied four years in divinity. Upon this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to Salamanca, where he continued to diſcourſe both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private upon moral ſubjects. Here he was again impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon an information of the Dominicans againſt him. He being releaſed, reſolved to quit Spain, and to go to Paris, with a firm reſolution to apply himſelf cloſely to ſtudy in that city. In 1538, Ignatius having aſſembled ten of his companions at Rome, choſen moſtly out of the univerſity of Paris, propoſed to them to make a new order. Paul III. confirmed the plan of his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a bull, in 1540, calling them therein <hi>the company of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> The order was confirmed by ſeveral ſucceeding Popes, who added many new rights and privileges to it. The end principally propoſed by this order is, to gain converts to the Romiſh church, with which view they diſperſe themſelves in every country and nation, and, with amazing induſtry and addreſs, purſue the ends of their inſtitution. No difficulty ſo great that they cannot ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, no danger ſo imminent that they will not undergo, and, as has been apparent, no crimes ſo ſhocking that have not been perpetrated by them, for the ſervice of their cauſes. They have been very conſpicuous by their miſſions into the Indies, and by their other employments relating to the ſtudy of the ſciences and the education of youth. They have lately, however, from the
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:454"/>practice of their abominable maxims, been expelled the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of France and Portugal, and the order ſeems every where upon the decline.</item>

                  <hi>Infinity,</hi> an attribute of God. "The idea of infinity or immenſity is ſo cloſely connected with that of ſelf-exiſtence, that, becauſe it is impoſſible but ſomething muſt be infinite, independently, and of itſelf, therefore it muſt of neceſſity be ſelf exiſtent; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſomething muſt of neceſſity be ſelf-exiſtent, therefore it is neceſſary that it muſt likewiſe be infinite. A neceſſary exiſtent being muſt be every where, as well as always, unalterably the ſame; for a neceſſity which is not every where the ſame, is plainly a conſequential neceſſity only, depending upon ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe. Whatever therefore exiſts by an abſolute neceſſity in its own nature, muſt needs be infinite, as well as eternal. To ſuppoſe a finite being to be ſelf-exiſtent, is to ſay, that it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction for that being not to exiſt, the abſence of which may yet be conceived, without a contradiction, which is the greateſt abſurdity in the world. From hence it follows, that the infinity of the ſelf-exiſtent being muſt be an infinity of fulneſs, as well as of immenſity; that is, it muſt not only be without limits, but alſo without diverſity, defect, or interruption. It follows likewiſe, that the ſelf-exiſtent being muſt be a moſt ſimple, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, incorruptible being, without parts, figure, motion, diviſibility, or any other ſuch properties as we find in matter; for all theſe things do plainly and neceſſarily imply finiteneſs in their very notion, and are utterly inconſiſtent with compleat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity. As to the particular manner in which the Supreme Being is infinite, or every where preſent, this is as impoſſible for our finite underſtandings to comprehend and explain, as it is for us to form an adequate idea of infinity. The ſchoolmen have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to aſſert, that the immenſity of God is a point, as his eternity (they think) is an inſiance. But this being altogether unintelligible, we may more ſafely affirm, that the ſupreme cauſe is at all times equally preſent, both in his ſimple eſſence, and by the immediate and perfect exerciſe of all his attributes, to every point of the boundleſs immenſity, as if it were really all but one ſingle point.</item>

A legate <hi>à latere</hi> has the power of conferring benefices without man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, of legitimating baſtards to hold offices, and has a croſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before him, as the enſign of his authority. The legates <hi>de latere</hi> are thoſe who are not Cardinals, but yet are inſtituted with an apoſtolical legation. Legates by office are thoſe who have not any particular legation given them, but who, by virtue of their dignity and rank in the church, become legates; ſuch are the Archbiſhops of Rheims and Arles. But the authority of theſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates is much inferior to that of the legates <hi>à latere.</hi> The power of a legate is ſometimes given without the title: ſome of the nuncio's are inveſted with it.

<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:459"/>phantom, invented by prieſts, and religion a ſtate-trick, to keep men in awe; that ſpiritual regeneration only conſiſts in ſtifling the remorſe of conſcience; repentance, in avowing to have done no evil; and that it is lawful, and even expedient, to diſſemble in matters of religion. To theſe they added horrid blaſphemies againſt Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying he was nothing but a mere <hi>je ne ſcai quoi,</hi> compoſed of the ſpirit of God, and of the opinion of men. Theſe maxims occaſioned their being called Libertines, and the word has been uſed in an ill ſenſe ever ſince. The <hi>libertini</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally ſpread in Holland and Brabant. Their leaders were one Quintin, a Picard, and another called Chopin, who joined with him, and became his diſciple. How ſimilar their opinions and maxims are with thoſe of the Libertines of the preſent age, the reader need not deſire to have pointed out.</item>

                  </gap>, in Latin <hi>Supplicatio,</hi> and <hi>Rogatio.</hi> The word Litany, in its original meaning, is but another name for prayer in general, and is uſed as ſuch by Heathen authors. In the Chriſtian ſenſe of the word, a litany is a ſolemn form of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God. Euſebius, ſpeaking of Conſtantine's cuſtom of making ſolemn addreſſes to God in his tent, ſays, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to render God propitious to him by his ſupplication and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies; and Arcadius, in one of his laws againſt heretics, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to hold profane aſſemblies in the city, either by night or by day, to make their litany. At that time the public pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hymns, and pſalmody, were all compriſed under the general name of litany. Afterwards, the word came to ſignify a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:460"/>ſort of prayers uſed in the church, concerning the original of which learned men are not agreed. At firſt the uſe of litanies was not fixed to any ſtated time, but they were employed only as exigencies required. They were obſerved, in imitation of the Ninevites, with ardent ſupplications and faſtings, to avert the threatening judgments of fire, earthquakes, inundations, or hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile invaſions. The days on which they were uſed were called Rogation-days. Several of theſe days were appointed by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of different councils, till the ſeventeenth council of Toledo decreed, that litanies ſhould be uſed every month throughout the year; and ſo, by degrees, theſe ſolemn ſupplications came to be uſed weekly, on Wedneſdays and Fridays, the ancient ſtationary days in all churches. As to the form in which litanies are made, namely, in ſhort petitions by the prieſt, which reſponſes by the people, St. Chryſoſtom derives the cuſtom from the primitive ages, when the prieſt began and uttered by the Spirit ſome things fit to be prayed for, and the people joined the interceſſions, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "We beſeech thee to hear us, good Lord." When the miraculous gifts of the Spirit began to ceaſe, they wrote down ſeveral of theſe forms, which were the original of our modern li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies. St. Ambroſe has left us one, agreeing in many things with that of our own church. About the year 400, litanies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be uſed in proceſſions, the people walking barefoot, and repeating them with great devotion. It is pretended ſeveral countries were delivered from great calamities by this means. About the year 600, Gregory the Great, out of all the litanies extant, compoſed the famous ſeven-fold litany, by which Rome, it is ſaid, was delivered from a grievous mortality. This has been a pattern to all the weſtern churches ſince, to which ours of the church of England comes nearer than that in the preſent Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Miſſal, in which later Popes have inſerted the invocation of ſaints, which our reformers juſtly expunged.

                  </gap>ſioned much ſcandal, it was decreed, that the litanies for the future ſhould only be uſed within the walls of the church. The days appointed by the fifteenth canon of our church for uſing the litany, are Wedneſdays and Fridays, the ancient faſting-days of the primitive church, to which, by the ſubric, Sundays are added, as being the days of the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly for divine ſervice. Before the laſt review of the Common-Prayer, the litany was a diſtinct ſervice by itſelf, and uſed ſome time after the morning-prayer was over. At preſent it is made one office with the morning-ſervice, being ordered to be read af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third collect for grace, inſtead of the interceſſional prayers in the daily ſervice.</item>

                  <hi>Liturgy,</hi> denotes all the ceremonies in general belonging to divine ſervice. In a more reſtrained ſignification, liturgy is uſed among the Romaniſts, to ſignify the maſs, and among us the Common-Prayer.
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:461"/>Prayer. All who have written on liturgies agree, that, in the primitive days, divine ſervice was exceedingly ſimple, clogged with a very few ceremonies, and conſiſting of but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prayers; but by degrees they increaſed the number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ceremonies, and added new prayers, to make the office look more awful and venerable to the people. At length things were carried to ſuch a pitch, that a regulation became neceſſary, and it was found proper to put the ſervice, and the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it, into writing; and this was what they called a liturgy. Liturgies have been different at different times, and in different countries. We have the liturgy of St. Chryſoſtom, that of St. Peter, of St. James, the liturgy of St. Baſil, the Armenian litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the liturgy of the Maronites, of the Cophtae, the Roman li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, the Gallican liturgy, the Engliſh liturgy, the Ambroſian liturgy, the Spaniſh and African liturgies, &amp;c.</item>

                  <hi>Liturgy of the church of England.</hi> This book is intitled, The Book of Common Prayer, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, according to the Uſe of the Church of England. Before the Reformation, the liturgy was only in Latin, being a collection of prayers, made up partly of ſome ancient forms uſed in the primitive church, and partly of ſome others of a later original, accommodated to the Romiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, at that time the religion of England. But when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in King Henry VIII.'s time, was diſpoſed to a reformation, it was thought neceſſary both to have the ſervice in the Engliſh or vulgar tongue, and to correct and amend the liturgy, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it of thoſe groſs corruptions which had gradually crept into it. And, firſt, the convocation appointed a committee, A. D. 1537, to compoſe a book, which was intitled, The godly and pious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Chriſtian Man, containing a Declaration of the Lord's Prayer, the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> the Creed, the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Seven Sacraments, &amp;c. This book was again publiſhed in 1540, with corrections and alterations, under the title of, A neceſſary Erudition of any Chryſten Man. In the ſame year, a committee of Biſhops and other divines was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by King Henry VIII. to reform the rituals and offices of the church, and the next year the King and clergy ordered the prayers for proceſſions and litanies to be put in Engliſh, and to be publickly uſed. Afterwards, in 1545, came out the King's primer, containing the whole morning and evening prayer in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, not very different from what it is in preſent from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer. Thus far the reformation of our liturgy was carried in the reign of Henry VIII.—In the year 1547, the firſt of King Edward VI. the convocation unanimouſly declared, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ought to be adminiſtered in both kinds; whereupon an act of parliament was made, ordering it to be adminiſtered; then a committee of Biſhops, and other learned divines, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:462"/>to compoſe an uniform order of communion, according to the rules of ſcripture, and the uſe of the primitive church. The committee accordingly met in Windſor caſtle, and drew up ſuch a form. This made way for a new commiſſion, impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame perſons to finiſh the whole liturgy, by drawing up public offices for Sundays and holydays, for the baptiſm, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, matrimony, burial, and other ſpecial occaſions.</item>

It is evident beyond diſpute, that the primitive church conſtantly uſed this form, after the fourth century, in her holy offices; and the practice was ſo univerſal and well known, that Lucian the Heathen is thought to refer to it in one of his dialogues, where he ſpeaks, in the perſon of a Chriſtian, of a prayer which began with Our Father.

The firſt, which he called light, did nothing but good; and the ſecond, which he called darkneſs, nothing but evil.

In truth, the Manichean doctrine was a ſyſtem of philoſophy, rather than of religion. They made uſe of amulets, in imitation of the Baſilidians, and are ſaid to have made profeſſion of aſtronomy and aſtrology. They denied that Jeſus Chriſt aſſumed a true human body, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it was only imagi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s. The reſt of their errors may be ſeen in St. Epiphanius, and St. Auguſtine; which laſt having been of their ſect, may be preſumed to have been thoroughly acquainted with them. Though the Manichees profeſſed to receive the books of the New Teſtament; yet, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they only took ſo much of them as ſuited with their opinions. They firſt formed to themſelves a certain idea, or ſcheme of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and to this adjuſted the writings of the Apoſtles; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that whatever was inconſiſtent with this, had been foiſted in the New Teſtament by latter writers, who were half Jews. On the other hand, they made fables, and apocryphal books, paſs for apoſtolical writings; and even are ſuſpected to have forged ſeveral others, the better to maintain their errors. St. Epiphanius gives a catalogue of ſeveral pieces, publiſhed by Manes, and adds extracts front ſome of them. Manes was not contented with the quality of Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo aſſumed that of the
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:465"/>Paraclete, whom Chriſt had promiſed to ſend. He left ſeveral diſciples, and among others Addas, Thomas, and Hermas. Theſe he ſent in his lifetime into ſeveral provinces, to preach his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Manes having undertaken to cure the King of Perſia's ſon, and not ſucceeding, was clapped into priſon upon the young Prince's death, whence he made his eſcape; but was apprehended ſoon after, and burnt alive. Towards the middle of the 12th century the ſect of Manichees took a new face, on occaſion of one Conſtantine, an Armenian, and adherer to it, who took upon him to ſuppreſs the reading of all other books, beſides the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and the epiſtles of St. Paul, which he explained in ſuch a manner, as to make them contain a new ſyſtem of Manicheiſm. He entirely diſcarded all the writings of his predeceſſors, rejected the chimeras of the Valentinians and their thirty Aeons, the fable of Manes, with regard to the origin of rain, which he made to be the ſweat of a young man in hot purſuit after a maid, and other dreams; but ſtill retained the impurities of Baſilides. In this manner he reformed Manicheiſm, inſomuch that his followers made no ſcruple of anathematizing Scythian Buldas, and even Manes himſelf, Conſtantine being now their great Apoſtle. After he had ſeduced an infinite number of people, he was at laſt ſtoned by order of the Emperor.</item>

                  <hi>Marriage,</hi> a contract, both civil and religious, between a man and a woman, by which they engage to live together in mutual love and friendſhip for the procreation of children, &amp;c. This has too near a connexion with religion to be omitted in this place. The firſt inhabitants of Greece lived promiſcuouſly without marriage. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crops, King of Athens, was the firſt author of this honourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution among that people. This is mentioned by the poet Nonnos. The Jews had their nuptial contracts and ceremonies. The preſent form among the Jews, which appears to be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, is very ſimple and ſignificant. Though our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had encouraged the inſtitution of marriage by his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at a wedding feaſt, and St. Paul has declared, that marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled; yet there wanted not men in the firſt ages of the Chriſtian church, who departed from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and doctrines of devils, forbidding to marry; and others who taught men to commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with licence and impunity. The ancient Chriſtian church laid ſeveral reſtraints upon her members in relation to marriage: ſuch were the rules forbidding Chriſtians to marry with Infidels and Heathens; this reſtraint they founded upon the Apoſtle's words: "Who leaves a widow at liberty to marry whom ſhe will, only in the Lord," 1 Cor. vii. 39. And upon this precept of the ſame Apoſtle: "Be ye not unequally y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed with unbelievers," 2 Cor. vi. 24. This reſtriction extended likewiſe to Jews, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, and all perſons of different perſuaſions, with whom it was unlawful for an orthodox Chriſtian to be j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ined in wedlock. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reſtraint of the church laid on perſons intending to marry, related to conſanguinity and affinity, which would have made the marriage inceſtuous, by coming within the degrees prohibited by God in ſcripture. A third reſtriction in this matter was, that children under age ſhould not marry without the conſent of their parents, guardians, and next relations. The Romiſh church has advanced marriage to the dignity of a ſacrament. The ritual tells
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:467"/>us, that the end of the ſacrament of marriage is, that man and wife may mutually help and comfort each other, in order that they may ſpend this life in a holy manner, and thereby gain a bleſſed immortality; and to contribute to the edification of the church, by the lawful procreation of children, and by the care of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them a ſpiritual regeneration, and an education ſuitable to it. They require that every perſon, before he enters into wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, beſeech God to join him with ſuch a perſon as he may work out his ſalvation with, and examine whether or no the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he has fixed his affections on has the fear of God before her eyes, is prudent, diſcreet, and able to take care of a family, &amp;c. In our church, the form and manner of marriage is too well known to need mention.</item>

They forbid all kind of ſwearing; deny that magiſtrates ought to uſe the ſword, tho' for puniſhment of crimes; diſallow of war; forbid miniſters of the goſpel preaching for hire; refuſe the baptiſm of infants; and believe the ſouls of good men are reſerved in ſome unknown place to the day of judgment.

                  <hi>Places, high.</hi> The people of Iſrael are frequently reproached in ſcripture for worſhipping upon high places. They were uſually mountains ſanctified by the preſence of patriarchs and prophets, or by the appearance of God thereon. Upon theſe eminences the ſuperſtitious Iſraelites often adored idols, and committed a thouſand abominations in groves and caves. This inflamed the zeal of ſeveral pious Kings and prophets to ſuppreſs and deſtroy the high places. But there was another reaſon why it was not lawful to worſhip even the true God on theſe hills, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Temple being built, and the place prepared for the fixed ſettlement of the ark, it was no longer allowed to ſacrifice out of Jeruſalem. Theſe high places, and the idolatrous worſhip paid thereon, were not wholly deſtroyed till the reign of Joſiah, who broke in pieces the images, cut down the groves, and filled the places with the bones of men, thus rooting out all the remains of idolatry, after it had been practiſed above eight hundred years.</item>

St. Francis de Salis, ſay the Quietiſts, was ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof, that he would not allow any body to convince him therein. But the man is, at length, ſufficiently paid for all this, by the embraces of God, and his own deification. The ſentiments of the Quietiſts with regard to God are wonderfully pure and diſintereſted. They love him for himſelf, on account of his own perfections, independantly of any rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The ſoul acquieſces in the will of God, even at the time when he precipitates it into hell; inſomuch, that inſtead of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him upon this occaſion, B. Angelo de Foligny cried out, <hi>Haſte, Lord, to caſt me into hell; do not delay, if thou haſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned me; but finiſh my deſtruction, and caſt me into the abyſs.</hi> At length the ſoul, after long travel, enters into reſt, into a perfect quietude. Here it is wholly employed in contemplating its God; it acts no more, thinks no more, deſires no more; but lies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly open, and at large, to receive the grace of God, who, by means thereof, drives it where it will, and as it will. In this ſtate it no longer needs prayers, or hymns, or vows; prayers where the Spirit labours, and the mouth opens, are the lot of the weak and the imperfect; the ſoul of the ſaint is, as it were, laid in the boſom, and between the arms of its God; where, without making any motion, or exerting any action, it waits and receives the divine grace. It then becomes happy: quitting the exiſtence it before had, it is now changed, it is transformed, and, as it were, ſunk and ſwallowed up in the Divine Being, inſomuch as not to know or perceive its being diſtinguiſhed from God himſelf. <hi>Fenelon, maximes des ſaints.</hi>

            <p>THUS having given a full account, not only of the pure and undefiled religion inſtituted by the Redeemer of mankind, but alſo of the various ſects and parties which have ariſen in the Chriſtian church, from ſuperadding to, or abſtracting from, or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly underſtanding or interpreting the ſcriptures, on the one hand, or from ſuperſtition or fran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ic enthuſiaſm on the other, many readers (before not much verſed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ſe matter.) may be apt to think lightly of religion itſelf, from the weakneſs or knavery of its profeſſors, and conceive an opinion, that ſcriptures ſo indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and capable of ſuch various ſenſes, are not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the rule of faith and practice, and the guide to eternal ſalvation. To ſuch I would addreſs the few following words.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the ſeveral religious parties in the world, there is ſuch a thing as true religion, abſtracted from the conſideration of all thoſe parties, and which the ſenſible and virtuous part of mankind are of, conſiſting in a reverential regard to the Supreme Being, and in ſeeking, by the practice of virtue, to ſecure his approbation in this ſtate, and in any future ſtate of exiſtence.</p>
            <p>The excellent faculties and powers men are endued with, the vaſt improvements they are capable of, and the deſire, if they are
<pb facs="tcp:0010800104:483"/>virtuous, and apprehenſions, if vicious, of an hereafter, ſeem, at leaſt, to be ſtrong preſumptions of ſuch a ſtate: and certainly, if there may be a future ſtate, and much more if it be probable there will, we ought to have a regard to it in our actions and conduct in this life. In ſuch a ſtate of things, where vice and bigotry ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to divide the world between them, a wiſe man will take care that he be neither irreligious or profane on the one hand, nor a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or enthuſiaſt on the other. Among the ſeveral ſorts of what are called revelations, I am aſſured you will find the Chriſtian to be moſt agreeable to reaſon and the nature of things, and, if rightly underſtood, to be a moſt perfect repreſentation of all moral virtues. I adviſe you therefore to cultivate a veneration for the writings wherein it is contained, and for its divine Author. Difference of ſtile, difference of cuſtoms, and the different tenets of mankind, in different ages and countries, may, as you have ſeen, together with ſome corruptions and interpolations, have occaſioned much obſcurity to us in ſeveral parts of theſe books; but all the rules of a good life and virtuous conduct are ſufficiently plain and intelligible. Public worſhip, if for the good of mankind in general, as we know it is, ought to be kept up, though the manner of it, in ſome religious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, may be lame and defective, and in others too ſuperſtitious. I adviſe you therefore diligently to ſearch the oracles of truth, and to work out your ſalvation with fear and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>embling, from thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſources. If you inquire with an unprejudiced and candid mind, after imploring the divine aſſiſtance, you will find what you ſeek; you will know and learn to practiſe your duty towards God and towards man, and will, with the poet, come to this concluſion:

Let ſome ſects give up their reaſon; let others even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card the ſcriptures, on which our religion is founded; we will ſtill pity and pray for them, but neither hate nor perſecute them; and, inſtead of adhering to the dogmas of men as fallible as ourſelves, we will apply for light and truth where they are to be found, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, with the great Chillingworth, that <hi>the Bible, the Bible alone, is the religion of Proteſtants.</hi>

            <p>In the Hiſtory of the QUAKERS, vol. iv. p. 237, note the 2d, inſtead of † <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 594, read, † <hi>Neale, vol.</hi> iv. p. 536. But I find Neale took the addreſs to King James from Eachard, and that it is not authentic. The ſubſtance of the real addreſs may be ſeen in Tindal's Rapin, vol. ii. p. 742. In the next edition of my work, it ſhall be inſerted, and the other expunged.</p>
