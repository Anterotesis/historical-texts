            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Beggar.</speaker>
               <p>IF Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am ſure No-body can diſpute mine. I own my ſelf of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their weekly Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals at St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s. I have a ſmall yearly Sallery for my Catches, and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I pleaſe, which is more than moſt Poets can ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Player.</speaker>
               <p>As we live by the Muſes, 'tis but Gratitude in us to encourage Poetical Merit where-ever we find it. The Muſes, contrary to all other Ladies, pay no Diſtinction to Drels, and never partially miſtake the Pertneſs of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery for Wit, nor the Modeſty of Want for Dulneſs. Be the Author who he will, we puſh his Play as far as it will go. So (though you are in Want) I wiſh you Succeſs heartily.</p>

               <speaker>Beggar.</speaker>
               <p>This Piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the Marriage of <hi>James Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Moll Lay,</hi> two moſt excellent Ballad-Singers. I have introduc'd the Similes that are in all your celebrated <hi>Operas</hi>: The <hi>Swallow,</hi> the <hi>Moth,</hi> the <hi>Bee,</hi> the <hi>Ship,</hi> the <hi>Flower,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have a Priſon Scene which the Ladies reckon charmingly pathetick. As to the Parts, I have obſerv'd ſuch a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impoſſible for either of them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that I have not made my Opera through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unnatural, like thoſe in vogue; for I have no Recitative: Excepting this, as I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to have neither Prologue nor Epilogue, it muſt be allow'd an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece indeed hath been heretofore frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by our ſelves in our great Room at St, <hi>Giles</hi>'s, ſo that I cannot too often acknowledge your Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.</p>

                     <p>A lazy Dog! When I took him the time before, I told him what he would come to if he did not mend his Hand. This is Death without Reprieve.

as far as prudently we can. In any thing, but Marriage! After that, my Dear, how ſhall we be ſafe? Are we not then in her Husband's Power: For a Husband hath the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power over alla Wife's Secrets but her own. If the Girl had the Diſcretion of a Court Lady, who can have a dozen young Fellows at her Ear without complying with one, I ſhould not matter it; but <hi>Polly</hi> is Tinder, and a Spark will at once ſet her on a Flame. Married! If the Wench does not know her own Profit, ſure ſhe knows her own Pleaſure better than to make herſelf a Property!

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1231302400:20"/>
Eſtate of Widow-hood, is the only Hope that keeps up a Wife's Spirits. Where is the Woman who would ſcruple to be a Wife, if ſhe had it in her Power to be a Widow whenever ſhe pleas'd? If you have any Views of this ſort, <hi>Polly,</hi> I ſhall think the Match not ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable.</p>

Why, <hi>Polly,</hi> the Captain knows, that as 'tis his Employment to rob, ſo 'tis ours to take Robbers; every Man in his Buſineſs. So that there is no Malice in the Caſe.</p>
