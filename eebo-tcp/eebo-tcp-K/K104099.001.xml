            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE intent of the following Volumes is to preſerve to the Public thoſe poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical performances, which ſeemed to merit a longer remembrance, than what would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſecured to them by the MANNER wherein they were originally publiſhed. This deſign was firſt ſuggeſted to the Editor, as it was afterwards conducted, by the opinions of ſome Gentlemen, whoſe names it would do him the higheſt honour to mention. He deſires in this place alſo to make his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to the Authors of ſeveral pieces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in theſe Volumes, which were never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in print; and which, he is perſuaded, would be thought to add credit to the moſt judicious collection of this kind in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. He hath nothing farther to premiſe, but that the Reader muſt not expect to be

                  <l>Then JOHNSON came, inſtructed from the ſchool,</l>

                  <l>Intrigue was plot, obſcenity was wit.</l>
                  <l>Vice always found a ſympathetick friend,</l>
                  <l>They pleas'd their age, and did not aim to mend.</l>

                  <l>And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days.</l>
                  <l>Their cauſe was gen'ral, their ſupports were ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>Their ſlaves were willing, and their reign was long;</l>

                  <l>In men and manners vers'd from life I write,</l>
                  <l>Not what was once, but what is now polite.</l>
                  <l>Thoſe who of courtly France have made the tour,</l>
                  <l>Can ſcarce our Engliſh aukwardneſs endure.</l>

                  <l>True Taſte to me is by this touchſtone known,</l>
                  <l>That's always beſt that's neareſt to my own.</l>
                  <l>To ſhew that my pretenſions are not vain,</l>
                  <l>My father was a play'r in Drury-lane,</l>

                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:0646900201:289"/>Pears and piſtachio-nuts my mother ſold,</l>
                  <l>He a dramatick poet, ſhe a ſcold.</l>
                  <l>His tragic Muſe could counteſſes affright,</l>
                  <l>His wit in boxes was my lord's delight.</l>
                  <l>No mercenary prieſt e'er join'd their hands,</l>
                  <l>Uncramp'd by wedlock's unpoetick bands.</l>
                  <l>Laws my Pindarick parents matter'd not,</l>
                  <l>So I was tragi-comically got.</l>
                  <l>My infant tears a ſort of meaſure kept,</l>
                  <l>I ſquall'd in diſtichs, and in triplets wept.</l>
                  <l>No youth did I in education waſte,</l>
                  <l>Happy in an hereditary Taſte.</l>
                  <l>Writing ne'er cramp'd the ſinews of my thumb,</l>
                  <l>Nor barbarous birch e'er bruſh'd my tender bum.</l>
                  <l>My guts ne'er ſuffer'd from a college cook,</l>
                  <l>My name ne'er enter'd in a buttery-book.</l>
                  <l>Grammar in vain the ſons of Priſcian teach,</l>
                  <l>Good parts are better than eight parts of ſpeech:</l>
                  <l>Since theſe declin'd, thoſe undeclin'd they call,</l>
                  <l>I thank my ſtars, that I declin'd them all.</l>
                  <l>To Greek or Latin tongues without pretence,</l>
                  <l>I truſt to mother wit and father ſenſe.</l>
                  <l>Nature's my guide, all ſciences I ſcorn,</l>
                  <l>Pains I abhor, I was a poet born.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet is my goût for criticiſm ſuch,</l>
                  <l>I've got ſome French, and know a little Dutch.</l>
                  <l>Huge commentators grace my learned ſhelves,</l>
                  <l>Notes upon books out-do the books themſelves.</l>

                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0646900201:290"/>Criticks indeed are valuable men,</l>
                  <l>But hyper-criticks are as good agen.</l>

                  <l>With notes by Bentley they'd be better ſtill.</l>
                  <l>The Boghouſe-Miſcellany's well deſign'd.</l>
                  <l>To eaſe the body, and improve the mind.</l>
                  <l>Swift's whims and jokes for my reſentment call,</l>
                  <l>For he diſpleaſes me that pleaſes all.</l>
                  <l>Verſe without rhyme I never could endure,</l>
                  <l>Uncouth in numbers, and in ſenſe obſcure.</l>
                  <l>To him as nature, when he ceas'd to ſee,</l>
                  <l>Milton's an univerſal blank to me.</l>
                  <l>Confirm'd and ſettled by the nation's voice,</l>
                  <l>Rhyme is the poet's pride, and people's choice.</l>
                  <l>Always upheld by national ſupport,</l>
                  <l>Of market, univerſity, and court:</l>
                  <l>Thomſon, write blank; but know that for that reaſon,</l>
                  <l>Theſe lines ſhall live when thine are out of ſeaſon.</l>
                  <l>Rhyme binds and beautifies the poet's lays,</l>
                  <l>As London ladies owe their ſhape to ſtays.</l>

                  <l>He thoroughly deſerves the modern bays.</l>
                  <l>It pleaſes me, that Pope unlaurell'd goes,</l>
