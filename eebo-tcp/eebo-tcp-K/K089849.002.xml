            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has for a long Time been an Objection to the Writer of Periodical Eſſays, that every Subject is pre-occupied, that the <hi>Spectator,</hi> the <hi>Tatler,</hi> and the <hi>Guardian</hi> have culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated every Field of Reflection, and that there remains nothing at preſent to be gleaned by ſucceſſive Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. Though I have all the Reſpect due to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the excellent Writers of the Performances juſt mentioned, I am far from paying them a blind Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; on the contrary, amidſt all that ſurprizing Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Genius, Wit, and Humour, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes many of their Writings, I can ſometimes deſcry a Subject careleſly treated, without any of their uſual Turns of Sentiment, or Beauties of Diction. I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0311400902:5"/>have now and then gone through a Series of important Trifles, and I have occaſionally found them vague upon Subjects of Criticiſm, indeterminate in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and looſe in their Definitions. If this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be the Caſe, would it not be an erroneous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to ſuppreſs every other Attempt, becauſe Sir <hi>Richard Steel</hi> planned ſo many Years before? Nay, even if they were free from any of thoſe Blemiſhes, which ariſe either from Inadvertence or the Imbecillity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, would it not be abſurd to extinguiſh the Seeds of laudable Emulation? Had the Rigour of this Sentence been carried into Execution, the World would never have been favoured with the admirable Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of the Author of the <hi>Rambler.</hi> That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Language has received from this Writer many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Ornaments, it is, I believe, univerſally felt by all Men of Taſte. Every Topic is by him treated with great Erudition and ſtrong Senſe, enlivened with all the glowing Colourings of a warm Imagination, and the whole carried on with a nervous, clear, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Stile. If the Performance in general has not the Variety of the <hi>Spectator,</hi> it is becauſe Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> wrote ſingly and alone, whereas the former was ſupported by ſeveral of eminent Abilities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the preſent Age there ſeems nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Coalition of Men of Parts to equal our Predeceſſors in all Manner of Periodical Writings.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, there are many Topics in every branch of Science and in all the liberal Arts, which may ſtill receive new Lights, and conduce both to the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and Inſtruction of the Public. Since Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s Time, a <hi>Du Bos</hi> has ſhone forth in <hi>France,</hi> and a <hi>Spence</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and the late ingenious Editor of a Tranſlation of <hi>Virgil</hi> is a convincing Proof that Rules for fine Writing, and Precepts of critical Knowledge may be ſtill enforced with great Elegance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, though the Eſſays on <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0311400902:6"/>on the <hi>Pleaſures of Imagination,</hi> muſt be allowed to have all the maſterly Strokes, that can reſult from a delicate and refined Taſte. The Regions of Reflection are like a Champain Country, in which different Objects preſent themſelves in various Attitudes to the Eye, and the Imagination is frequently caught by Parts of the Proſpect, which have eſcaped another's Obſervation, each Perſon receiving different Senſations, according as the Fancy is diſpoſed for the Sublime, the Wonderful, or the Beautiful in the natural World.</p>
                  <p>Beſides; the continual Fluctuation of Faſhions, Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Manners muſt always afford freſh Matter for the Satyriſt of Wit and Humour. The Tree of Folly is like the Tree mentioned by the Author of my Motto; though many have plucked a Branch from it, it is always quickly replaced by another, and the new Growth ſhoots into Day-light with undiminiſhed Fertility.</p>
                  <p>Are there thoſe who are pleaſed to indulge a delicate Vein of Raillery on the Foibles and Piccadillos of the Fair? Never was there more ample room to diſplay a Turn of Wit, in this Way, than what the preſent Times are ſo happy as to afford. The Hoop has of late ſwelled to a wider Circumference than ever, and by the Help of a few formidable Rows of Steel, threatens Miſchief to the whole Circle of Beaux, who cannot now approach the Ladies in their Entrenchments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifeſt Danger of fracturing a Shin-bone, hurting the Pan of the Knee, or ſome ſuch Diſaſter While this Faſhion prevails, the Ladies may be charged with carrying concealed Arms, and making Uſe of maſked Barteries; for which, by the Way, they have no manner of Occaſion as they ſeem at preſent to be in Poſſeſſion of more Courage than any <hi>Amazon</hi> mentioned in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. For whereas thoſe Viragos uſed to encounter with ONLY ONE BREAST EXERTED, the modern La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not afraid of meeting the Men with both quite naked and diſplayed to View.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0311400902:7"/>built up many Stories higher than it uſed to be, and the Art of Painting is now arrived to ſuch Perfection, that it is abſolutely impoſſible to know a female Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance for any length of Time, each lovely Fair having as many Faces and Complexions, as Gloves, Fans or Tippets. Add to this, that you may meet a Lady To-day with an elegant Shape, fine by Degrees and delicately leſs, and To-morrow ſhe will appear as big round the Waiſt, as if within a few Days of her Time.

                  <p>On this Account, though I have now felt the Anxiety of a Writer for twelve Months paſt, I have reſolved with myſelf not to lay down my Pen, until I am warned to do it by the Laſſitude of an Author, or, what is worſe, the Laſſitude of the Reader. At preſent however I do not find any Symptoms of this Sort in my own Breaſt, nor can I learn that my Paper declines with my Readers. In my Rambles ſince laſt <hi>Saturday,</hi> I did not meet with any Thing that made againſt me. At <hi>Sam</hi>'s Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> informed me, that, his Cuſtomers hope I am not going to leave off Trade.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have in a former Paper delivered my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents concerning the notable Art of Humbugging; I ſhall this Day throw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſome curſory Reflections upon the Practice of Raillery, which, in my Opinion, it is the Intereſt of Society to explode from every Company.</p>
                  <p>I am induced into this Way of thinking from an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that few People are properly qualified to exerciſe this Talent, there being hardly any Thing which requires ſo fine an Underſtanding, together with ſo much Delicacy in the Exertion of it. But as Matters are generally managed, there is nothing ſo coarſe as the Attempts of thoſe, who are ambitious of ſhining in Converſation, and are therefore determined to banter Mankind into an exalted Opinion of their Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The utmoſt that can be allowed to theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is to join in the general Laugh; and, if Mirth ſhould be going forward, they may very properly be admitted to partake of the frolic Feſtivity, without vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretending to take the Lead, or to engroſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0311400902:11"/>into their own Hands; in like Manner as the uninformed Country Squire ſhould not be ſuffered by the Maſter of the Ceremonies in a polite Aſſembly, to come forward in a Minuet, where the Graces of Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are required, though he may be tolerated to romp in a Country Dance, and diſplay all the Gambols of his unfaſhioned Agility.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>— Nec cum ſis caetera foſſor</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Tres tantum ad numeros Satyri moveare Bathylli.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> Were I to define Raillery, I ſhould call it a delicate Exertion of Pleaſantry upon the Foibles or the ſlight Inadvertences, which diſcloſe themſelves in the Actions of Men. From this View of Matters, it will appear, that no Tincture of Ill-nature muſt be ſuffered to disfigure the Surface; that only ſlight Errors muſt be the Ground on which the Colouring is laid, and that good Manners muſt give a Poliſh to the Whole. No Man has any Degree of Right to invade another's inward Peace, and therefore a well turned Mind will always decline any Thing that comes home to the Boſom of any Perſon, with whom he is willing to enter into Society. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may tend to create Diſ-eſteem in the Circle of our Acquaintance, or to throw a ridiculous Light upon a Character; whatever may excite uneaſy Senſations by touching upon Circumſtances, about which it is poſſible a Perſon may have a tender Feeling, though in their own Nature, they are not of any material Importance; in ſhort, all Topics, but ſuch, as we are convinced the the Object of our Merriment will give up, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided; and it will be always highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſo to glide gently over the affected Part, that the Wound may appear to be probed by a ſkilful Hand. I have ſomewhere read a Story of <hi>Jack Ketch</hi>'s Wife, which I think throws a Light on this Matter. Any Body, ſays that elegant Lady, can tuck a Man up, and ſtop his Breath, but to do it with Dexterity, and make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0311400902:12"/>the Culprit die an eaſy pleaſant Death, is only the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Qualification of my Huſband. Thus it requires no very ſhining Abilities to inform our Neighbour of his Oddities, and point out to him his ſlight Indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but to open his Eyes, and let in the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rendering it painful to him; to give a Senſe of the Foible without diſturbing the natural Complacence, with which every one is willing to behold himſelf, is a Taſk which requires more Elegance and Refinement than hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to fall to the Share of every Individual. And yet there is no going any where without meeting Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this Way; every Quarter of the Town abounds with Men of Raillery, and to all theſe it is neceſſary to render an Account of our Actions, our Friends, our Attachments, our Cloaths, our Walk, and what not? To all theſe notable Perſonages I would beg leave to recommend the following Story. A Gentleman was one Day ſhaving himſelf in his Parlour to the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of <hi>Otho,</hi> his Monkey, who ſtood by him won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleaſed with the Turn of his Wriſt, and the Dexterity of every Stroke. The Operation being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Gentleman gone out without laying up his Utenſils, <hi>Otho</hi> mounts the Table, fixes himſelf before the Glaſs and flouriſhes the Razor with mimic Skill, till unfortunately he cut his Jaw acroſs, and then too late found the Danger of playing with Edge Tools:</p>
                  <p>I have drawn up an allegorical Account of the Birth and Parentage of <hi>Raillery,</hi> which, I think, may ſerve to lay before the Reader its ſeveral efficient Qualities.</p>
                  <p>GOOD-SENSE and RIDICULE were joined in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock; the Offspring of their Marriage was HUMOUR, who for a long Time roved about <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> placing the Follies and Whims of Mankind in ſuch a Light, as never failed to excite Mirth in the Synod of <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muſes. At length happening to wander out of Bounds, HUMOUR met, upon the Borders of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> juſt upon the Verge of worldly Commerce, a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0311400902:13"/>certain Lady known by the Name of ILL-NATURE. Drawn in by falſe Allurements and a glavering Smile, which ILL-NATURE always wore upon her Countenance, HUMOUR offered Propoſals of Marriage, which were carried without Delay into Execution, and in nine Months Time RAILING was uſhered into the World. With a ſmall Mixture in his Compoſition of his Father's Qualities ſtrongly blended with the complexional Habits of his Mother, RAILING grew up in the Practice of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the infirmities of all who came in his Way. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſtraint he took unbecoming Liberties with private Families, ſowed the Seeds of Diſcontent in every Breaſt, and in Time began to diſturb the Harmony of the ſacred Nine. Whereupon <hi>Thalia,</hi> conceived an Averſion to him, and in order to mend the Breed preferred a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to <hi>Apollo</hi> to divorce HUMOUR from his Wife ILL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATURE.</p>
                  <p>After a full hearing of the Cauſe. <hi>Apollo</hi> iſſued out his Edict of Separation. HUMOUR could not live ſingle, and in a ſhort Time made another Match, which, as good Luck would have it, turned out better than the former. His ſecond Wife's Name was WIT, a Lady of great Vivacity, and abounding in ſurprizing Turns in all her Converſation. She hardly could ſee any Thing, but her Way was inſtantly to compare it to ſome other Object in Nature, and ſhe frequently would make her Auditors laugh by pointing out a latent Reſemblance in Things, which ſeemed in their own Natures abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely repugnant to each other. Her principal Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to ſet off her Huſband, and though ſhe was fond of great Variety in her Dreſs, ſhe would upon many Occaſions lend her beſt Apparel to HUMOUR, who never failed to look moſt engaging, when WIT contributed her Ornaments. HUMOUR, in his Turn, gave ſupernumerary Embelliſhments to his Wife, and they both reflected a reciprocal Luſtre upon each other. They continued in a State of mutual Fondneſs, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0311400902:14"/>their faithful Love was in Time rewarded with a tender Daughter, who was immediately called, with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſent, by the Name of RAILERY. The MUSES cheriſhed her in their Boſoms, and as ſhe grew up ſhe diſcovered a Propenſity to her Father's Way of thinking, but with a conſiderable Abatement of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. The Mother's Delicacy ſhe poſſeſſed entire, and whenever ſhe touched upon any Thing, like her, ſhe endeavoured to give it an agreeable Colouring. In this Habit ſhe was further confirmed by POLITENE<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>S, a collateral Relation by the Mother's Side, who took upon her the Care of her Manners, and inſtructed her perfectly in all the ſecondary Qualities or leſſer Morals, which are commonly known by the Name of Good-breeding. Being confirmed in theſe Principles RAIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERY was, at a mature Age, truſted abroad into the World, where ſhe had not been long before ſhe was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed by the courtly <hi>Horace,</hi> who took her Home to his own Houſe, introduced her to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and found her of ſingular Service in all his Writings. At the Demiſe of that Bard, RAILLERY wandered a Vagrant up and down, till at length ſhe took it into her Head to viſit <hi>Boileau</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> from whence ſhe came over to <hi>England</hi> and reſided for many Years at <hi>Twickenham</hi> with the late Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> from whoſe Retreat ſhe would now and then make an Excurſion to paſs ſome Hours with Doctor <hi>Young</hi> and Mr. <hi>Addiſon.</hi> At preſent, it is ſaid, that ſhe is taken into Keeping by a certain noble Earl, of whom ſhe is ſo enamoured, that it is confidently reported, ſhe will not quit his Company, though he is now in Danger of becoming deaf; and it is further ſaid, that ſhe will ſtick by him to his laſt Breath; but, at that unhappy Juncture what will become of her, no Body can pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Exerciſe of the Fan</hi> was propoſed in the Days of the <hi>Spectator,</hi> as a Study highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Ladies of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Scheme, offered to their Conſideration, included all the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Perfections in the Management of that pretty ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatile Machine. Though I muſt allow that Directions of this Nature were greatly conducive to a proper Diſplay of many female Charms, there is ſtill a more uſeful Syſtem of Rules for the playing off Love's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, which I beg Leave, through the Channel of your Paper, to convey to the Notice of my beautiful Countrywomen. The Syſtem of Rules which I here intend, is the <hi>Exerciſe of the Lips,</hi> and, after mature Conſideration, I think the whole Secret may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under the following Heads.</p>

                        <p>The Mouth being a leading Feature in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the Seat of the Graces, where all the winning Loves and each amiable Smile have planted their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, there cannot be too much Care employed by the Ladies to acquire a Pair of well diſciplined Lips, readily obedient to each of the Rules above eſtabliſhed, and capable with Quickneſs and Eaſe to perform every Branch of this delectable Exerciſe.</p>
                        <p>With Regard to the firſt Word of Command; a due Degree of Moiſture gives a ſparkling Luſtre to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Vermillion of the Skin, like Roſes freſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled with the Morning-Dew; it contributes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to hinder them from appearing dry and rough, as is generally the Caſe with old Maids; the leaſt Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of which the Ladies ſeem willing to avoid, by the preſent Taſte of extending the Shape beyond its juſt Proportion, by a faſhionable Enormity of the Stays.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Biting the Lips</hi> is attended with more Difficulty than the premiſed Rule, becauſe it is more complicated in its Nature and includes the Operation of the Paſſions. There are always many Topics in Converſation, upon which this Practice, if well managed, has a very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Significance. When, for Inſtance, diſagreeable Thoughts obtrude, it ſerves to excite new Ideas in the Fancy; it likewiſe prevents the unſeaſonable Eruption of a conſcious Laugh, when the Libertine Wit of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi> or <hi>Vanbrugh,</hi> provokes a betraying Simper; not to mention that it helps to heighten the natural Redneſs of the Lip, and raiſes a Degree of Anxiety in the Men, for Fear the Delicacy of the Skin ſhould ſuffer too much from too violent a Preſſure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0311400902:18"/>I do not doubt, but it may ſeem perfectly eaſy to open the Lips, but this alſo I take to be a Matter of no ſmall Difficulty. Very few, it is obſervable, open their Lips to any Purpoſe; beſides it ſhould never be done with too great a Precipitance, but always gradually and by due Degrees. Should there happen to be drawn up, within, an elegant Row of beautiful white Teeth, it will be ſure to add greatly to the natural Bloom, by exhibiting an agreeable Contraſt; like Ivory ſtained with a juſt Arrangement of crimſon Colours. On this Head it may not be improper to caution my pretty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt an indolent Cuſtom of relaxing into a Yawn, which diſtends the Mouth beyond its proper Size, and generally occaſions the witty Saying, <q>
                              <hi>Thank you for not ſwallowing me.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Before the Lips are cloſed, it is eligible to confer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them a new Refreſhment of Moiſture, and, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven the Colour: If they were to undergo the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biting, I ſhould not think it amiſs. Shutting the Lips I have often remarked, is extremely becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in moſt Ladies, and, I think, cannot be too much practiſed by old Maids, Wives, and indeed the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Women. In cloſing them, however, there are different Degrees of Preſſure to be obſerved, becauſe in this alſo the Paſſions are concerned. When they gently touch each other, it gives a Variety to the Air of the Face, by giving it an unuſual Degree of Length; but in this, thoſe, who have naturally a long Viſage, are to be particularly cautious. When ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the Dimples in the Cheeks are diſplayed to Advantage, and the whole Face is enlivened with a pleaſing Serenity. If ſqueezed cloſe together, it throws a beautiful Penſiveneſs into the Looks, which is ſeldom acquired to any Degree of Perfection by the Generality of the Sex; but when properly attained, it carries with it an elegant Kind of dumb Eloquence, which the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0311400902:19"/>Critics have obſerved, is often a great Beauty in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and certainly has its Portion of Grace among the fair Sex. I know a Gentleman who can read the Thoughts of any Lady whatever by obſerving the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of the Lips. He tells me, he has obſerved a Pair of Lips ſpeak, without any Motion for an Hour together, and he has a Liſt of Lips, which he ſays, are abſolute Prudes; others that are Rakes; ſome that are amorous, and ſome that are ſwelled with Pride, and from a long Courſe of Enquiry he finds that they have more Electricity than any other Subſtance in Nature.</p>
                        <p>But theſe Remarks belong more immediately to the following Head of <hi>Pouting the Lips,</hi> which is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than any Rule advanced as yet. In doing this, it will be always found expedient to moiſten and bite them firſt, that, when prominent, the Under-lip may look as if pregnant with Delight. The Paſſions of Scorn, Indignation, Contempt, and the whole Family of Pride, are finely marked by this Poſition. I have known a pouted Lip to look down upon a Rival Beauty during an entire Tragedy, and I have ſeen a Lady, without uttering a ſingle Word, tell a Man, that ſhe thought him an unmannered Coxcomb, by a forcible Exertion of this expreſſive Feature. I muſt obſerve, that this Practice becomes handſome Faces only; to ſuch it gives an Air of Elevation, or a pretty Sullenneſs, which throws a kind of amiable Severity over the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Ugly Women ſeldom have this Art in any Perfection.</p>
                        <p>The laſt Rule is to <hi>Reſt your Lips,</hi> and is the moſt neglected of any, though highly eſſential in this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Language. Young Girls can never be brought to pay the leaſt Attention to this Precept; but were they ſenſible, that when the Features are leſt to diſplay their own native Graces without Art, their Charms are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, I am convinced this Word of Direction would be better obſerved. This Rule is more extenſive than
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0311400902:20"/>the foregoing, becauſe it is proper for all Ladies in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whereas the former ſhould never be practiſed but by ſuch of the Fair, as are bleſſed with a blooming Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and a Delicacy of Features.</p>
                        <p>The Bounds of Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi>'s Paper will not permit me to expatiate further; I ſhall therefore, at Maturity, publiſh by Subſcription an entire Book, called the <hi>Oeconomy of the Lips;</hi> in which I ſhall explain at large the Doctrine here delivered, and I ſhall adapt each Article to the Make of the Countenance. The whole ſhall be concluded with <hi>an Eſſay on the Paſſions of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Lips,</hi> and to the Honour of this Part of the Face, I ſhall prove, that in theſe Days of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is centered with them, as what few Prayers are ſaid at preſent, come from the Lips only, without the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> being at all concerned in the Matter.

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MIDST all the frolic Excurſions of Fancy to which you have occaſionally given vent in your <hi>Saturday</hi>'s Compoſitions, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that there is not one of them but has ſome Degree of Tendency to the Inſtruction, as well as Entertainment of your Readers. On this Account, I hope you will not refuſe a Place in your Paper to a Correſpondent, who means to ſhew the Futility of a Maxim, which has gained Credit with moſt People, though extremely ill-grounded, as, I think, I can fairly evince, from an experimental Knowledge of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>You undoubtedly recollect that <hi>Ovid</hi> has in one of his Elegies the following Lines.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos;</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Tempora ſi fuerint nubila, ſolus eris.</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
                        <p>Now, Sir, it is ſo far from being true, that a Man is ſurrounded with Friends in Proſperity, and is left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute under his Misfortunes, that I will undertake to prove the very Reverſe; in doing this I flatter myſelf I ſhall ſerve the Purpoſes of Virtue, and vindicate the Dignity of human Nature.</p>
                        <p>You muſt know then, that I came to this Town, a few Years ſince, with Intent to read the Law, having juſt Fortune enough to ſupport me in my Studies, until I might fix myſelf in a tolerable Road of Buſineſs. For this Purpoſe I lodged in one of the Inns of Court, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0311400902:24"/>the Oeconomy, which I was obliged to obſerve, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it impoſſible for me to go much into Company, I ſoon found out that I led a very muzzy Sort of a Life. I therefore ſhifted the Scene, and though, in a ſhort Time, I found means to run out my little Fortune, I cannot ſay, that I was relinquiſhed by the World on this Account. It is true that ſome of my Acquaintance totally deſerted me, but it was the Occaſion, at the ſame Time, that others were more earneſtly attached than they would otherwiſe have been. I remember the laſt Word my Aunt in the Country ſaid to me, was <q>
                              <hi>Bob, wherever you go, be ſure to make Friends for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
                           </q> this Advice, I will venture to ſay, I have had the Addreſs to conform to with great Succeſs, as will appear from the Sequel.</p>
                        <p>Moſt of the Friendſhips of the World are Leagues in Debauchery and Intemperance, made in the drawing of a Cork, and often ended in the ſame Manner. <hi>Out of Sight out of Mind</hi> is certainly true, with Regard to the Generality of Connections, but the Impreſſions I have made upon the Minds of my Friends are not ſo eaſily effaced. On the contrary, when it happens that I am ſeldom ſeen by them, they are known to be in very great Solicitude about me, are conſtantly very earneſt in, their Enquiries after me, and the Diſcourſe they uſually have with each other is, <q>Have you ſeen our old Friend lately—I can't think what's become of him—I hope he is not gone out of Town—I have not ſeen him for a long Time,—faith, I'm very uneaſy about him—I wiſh to God he would ſee and ſettle his Affairs—He's a very careleſs young Fellow—a great deal too wild — throws away his Money like Dirt—I have call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him Morning after Morning, but all to no Purpoſe—I'd give a Bottle of Wine I could meet with him—I'd rather that than my Dinner—I never long'd ſo much to ſee any body.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe are the general Expreſſions of Anxiety which my Friends expreſs on my Account, and there are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0311400902:25"/>ſome of them who are not content to reſt here; Words coſt nothing; they carry the Thing to ſuch a Length as to employ a Couple of Fellows, who are daily in all Quarters of the Town hunting and prying about for me. As there are few Inſtances of ſuch earneſt Friendſhip in the World, I am ſenſible what I have ſaid, may have a romantic Appearance, and Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> may ſuggeſt to himſelf, that I am entertaining him all this Time with a Novel; but, Sir, I muſt take Leave to aſſure you that every Word is literally true, and what may perhaps raiſe your Idea ſtill higher, is, not one of all theſe People has ever got a Shilling by me; and I verily believe few of them ever will. Having ſaid thus much in the Praiſe of theſe my Well-wiſhers, it will naturally be deſired of me, to inform the World who and what they are, who are in ſuch Concern about a Stranger. Not to keep you any longer in Suſpence I will now tell you, that I have experienced all this Generoſity from my CREDITORS.</p>
                        <p>By this it will appear that the Pleaſure of being in Debt, though very common in Life, is very little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Generality of thoſe, who addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Gratification. The Art in all theſe Caſes is to refine upon the Occurrences and Diſappointments, to which our State is liable; and, for my Part, the Pleaſure juſt mentioned is one of the moſt valuable Enjoyments of my Life. My Morning <hi>Levee</hi> is as great as any Nobleman's, whereas in the Days that that I could ſay I was in Poſſeſſion of a Competence, I never had any Viſitor whatever, except a Laundreſs to make my Bed in the <hi>Temple.</hi> But now the Caſe is perfectly altered; there is a conſtant Crowd of Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants about my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oors, and to thoſe, that are admitted, I have the Pleaſure of making as many Promiſes, as a Miniſter of State, beſides a lofty Pride in keeping them much after the ſame Faſhion. Upon theſe Occaſions it will now and then happen, that they who beſt know
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0311400902:26"/>how to make their Court, and have the Art of taking a pliant Hour, ſometimes prevail upon me to appoint a Day for the Completion of their Wiſhes. As Things of Conſequence cannot be done in a violent Hurry, the Day, agreed upon is generally very diſtant, may be from ſix to nine or twelve Months, during which Space of Time, it is obſervable that their Good-nature never ſuffers the leaſt Abatement, but they remain as ſolicitous as ever, frequently expreſſing the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Regard for my Welfare. <q>My dear Sir, do, take a little Care of yourſelf—It goes to my very Heart to hear you cough ſo hard—Why you'll not live three Months at this Rate—Be adviſed by me, and put a Stocking about your Neck To-night, and take ſomething to ſweat you a little and eaſe your Cheſt—You ſhould not drink ſo much—Conſider, it impairs both Conſtitution and Purſe—You know it's for your Good I ſpeak—You'd be a great Loſs to your Friends—Take up a little, Fleſh and Blood can't hold it always.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> am I beloved, and that for no other Reaſon, but my Addreſs in making Friends for myſelf, and I am ſo cloſely watched by theſe generous Creatures, that it is totally out of my Power to take any wrong Step, that might be detrimental to my Affairs. Of this I had a convincing Proof about a Year ago, when the Interpoſition of my Taylor hindered me from committing a very inconſiderate Action. I was going with a Friend to take a Trip to <hi>Paris,</hi> by which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition I muſt certainly have been drained of all my ready Money; but the Vigilance of my Friend contrived to have me ſtopped as I was juſt ſtepping into the Poſt-Chaiſe, and I was thence conducted to a generous Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff's Houſe in <hi>Gray's-Inn Lane,</hi> for the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds. Here I remained confined till my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Travel was perfectly cooled, and when I was at length reſtored to my Liberty, my abovementioned
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0311400902:27"/>Friends, took particular Care not to leave me a ſingle Shilling, for Fear I ſhould have the ſame unhappy Turn a ſecond Time.</p>
                        <p>While I thus enjoy the Aſſiduity and Benevolence of ſuch a Number, who are kind enough to intereſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in my Affairs, I muſt own there is a Species of Creditors, who are an Exception to the general Rule; for though all thoſe of whom I have hitherto been ſpeaking, are upon every Occaſion highly pleaſed to meet me, this laſt Claſs deteſt the very Sight of me. As I am not conſcious that I have ever done any Thing to incur their Diſpleaſure to ſo great a Degree, their Averſion ſhocks me the more; and notwithſtanding all the Pains I have taken to ſoften them by Politeneſs they ſtill remain inexorable. Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them, I endeavour to put them off with the handſomeſt Apology in my Power; but all to no Purpoſe; I have run too far in Arrears, and they are not by any Means to be ſatisfied. As I ſhould be glad if you would give them a Word of Advice I will juſt hint to you that the Perſonages, whom I mean, are no other than GENTLEMEN'S SERVANTS. The Cry among them all is, What can a poor Serving-Man do, if he is robb'd of his juſt Vails by ſuch Scoundrels? They are all very unwilling to let me run further in their Debt, and therefore it is I can hardly get any Thing out of their Hands. If I call for Beer at Table, they are ſure not to hear me, till their Maſter orders them to ſerve the Gentleman; then I receive the Leavings of the Tankard juſt out of the Hands of the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Swallow in the Company. In ſhort, the Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs of theſe my Creditors is a great Diſcount upon my Happineſs, and I muſt confeſs there is no kind of Pleaſure in being in Debt to them. However I muſt endeavour to bear this Inconvenience, and if you will be pleaſed to inſert this Letter in the <hi>Gray</hi>'s <hi>Inn Journal</hi> I ſhall be proud to get into your Books, and ſhall have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0311400902:28"/>the further Pleaſure of being indebted to Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> for this Act of Civility which will always oblige me to be,</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> WRITER of periodical Eſſays is like one, who goes coaſting from Place to Place, with Intent to lay down a Chart of the Courſe of the Country, the Extent of the ſeveral Parts, the Bearings, Limits and Connections. As the latter fails along, every minute Object furniſhes him with Matter of Contemplation, and not a Hill lifts its Head, whether cloathed with Verdure and imbower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with over-hanging Wood, or wild, barren and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but he inſtantly treaſures it in the Storehouſe of Imagination. Each Receſs of the Land, each Creek, Rock and Harbour demand a particular Notice, and he is frequently induced to pauſe in theſe Reflections, heedleſs of the unbounded Proſpect which the Ocean preſents him. In like Manner, the Perſon who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a Courſe of Lucubrations to be publiſhed on a ſtated Day, is conſtantly traverſing about, in order to delineate a juſt Repreſentation of the different Scenes of Life, and to gratify his Readers with particular Charts, which may either ſerve to pleaſe the Fancy, or contribute to the Purpoſes of Improvement and Utility. In his Intercourſe with Men and Manners every Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence attracts his Eye; and in his Converſe with Books, he often meets with Paſſages, which deſerve to be minutely ſet down in the Account of his Voyage through this Sea of Troubles, and they may ſerve as Lights or Landmarks to thoſe who are bound upon the ſame Adventure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0311400902:37"/>It is thus the beſt Eſſays are ſuggeſted, and I muſt own, I never yet, peruſed a good Author, but I thence deduced ſome Hint, which afterwards unfolded ſeveral latent Reflections, that might otherwiſe eſcape me. The Claſſics are particularly uſeful in this Way; They diſplay, upon all Occaſions, ſuch bright Traces of a manly Way of Thinking, and abound with ſo many excellent and cloſe Remarks, artfully interwoven with the Thread of their Poem or Narration, that a Man converſant with their Productions will be always able to draw very amply from their Stores.</p>
                  <p>In peruſing, a few Nights ſince, <hi>Florus</hi>'s <hi>Compendium</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, I was greatly ſtruck with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, in the Character of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> which that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though no extraordinary Maſter of the Graces and Elegancies of Compoſition, has found Means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert with his uſual Cloſeneſs. <q>
                        <hi>Tarquin</hi> (ſays <hi>Florus</hi>) inſulted all Mankind with an overbearing Pride, which, to an ingenuous Mind, is worſe than Cruelty.</q> This ſhort Obſervation moſt certainly carries with it a great Deal of Truth, and deſerves to be enforced with all the Strength of Reaſon and Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>A witty Satiriſt has called Pride the univerſal Paſſion, and indeed its Influence on Mankind is ſo manifeſt, that there is too much Reaſon to believe the Maxim well founded. The general Prevalence of Politeneſs ſuppreſſes in ſome Meaſure the Appearance of it among the <hi>French,</hi> but any one, who has been at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> may remember, that after all the Attention and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the embroidered Gentleman, who undertakes the Office of ſhewing the Curioſities of the Place, the Ceremony is always concluded with a Conſciouſneſs of their national Superiority, which breaks out in a briſk Queſtion with a Shrug of the Shoulder. <q>

                        <hi>London.</hi>
                     </q> In <hi>Italy, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> their Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is manifeſted by the frequent Uſe of the Stilleto upon every trivial Occaſion; Pride is there diſplayed by killing others, and the People of <hi>England</hi> diſcover it by murdering themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Notion of Independance with which a free-born <hi>Briton</hi> is inflamed, renders him untractable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to all Laws; <hi>Religion</hi> he makes a Joke of, and he wonders at the Impertinence of the Parliament in attempting to reſtrain his unqueſtionable Right to diſpoſe of his Perſon as he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>The famous <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> imputes the Variety of Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which prevail in this Country, to the general Infection of the Scurvy; but if he had charged it upon our national Sturdineſs, I am inclinable to think, he would have aſſigned a truer Cauſe, though, perhaps, at the ſame Time, black and ſizy Blood may not a little contribute to aggravate the Diſtemper. To ſpeak with Preciſion, Pride is to the Soul what the Scurvy is to the Body, each in their ſeparate Channels the Source of ill Humours, Maladies and Diſorders. The fatal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the corporal Indiſpoſition, juſt mentioned, have been ſo ſeverely felt for a long Time paſt, that our common News-Papers are filled with Advertiſements of Chymical Drops, to eradicate it entirely out of the Blood. This certainly would have been a great Benefit to Society, but, I apprehend, he would deſerve ſtill more who ſhould deviſe a Cure for the Diſeaſe of the Mind. On this Account I ſhould be glad to ſee a Paragraph in the Papers to the following Effect.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>To Perſons of either Sex, afflicted with any Species of <hi>PRIDE.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NEVER were <hi>Pride, Arrogance,</hi> and <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> ſo frequent as of late Years; nor has any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy been found adequate to this pernicious Habit, which occaſioned a Phyſician of the Soul, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0311400902:39"/>his Thoughts much concerning them, to adapt a Medicine, or Moral Elixir, which is a ſovereign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt PRIDE and all the Variety of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, by which it mimics, by Turns, almoſt all the Vices poor Mortals are afflicted with, and have their Riſe from a depraved Selfiſhneſs of Thinking, vicious Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ill-nature, and the Want of Self-knowledge; whence proceed the ſupercilious Brow, and ſurly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs in the Men, and Coquetry, Airs, Fidgets, Tehees and Titters in the Women, which totally deſtroy their Beauty and their Features, and by a Conſent of Parts affect their Heads, and produce direful Views and terrible Apprehenſions; at other Times, Fits, fluſhing Heats, Lowneſs and Sinking of the Spirits, Palpitation of the Heart, Twitchings of the Limbs, with many convulſive Diſorders, which affect Numbers of both Sexes.</p>
                     <p>The above Elixir is a wonderful Alterative, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions laudable Humility, and as ſoon as taken, makes the Patient good-humoured, chearful, and affable to Admiration, and is good for all Sorts of People to preſerve, as well as procure, an even Temper of Mind.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Whenever I meet with a proud Man, I ſhould be glad to know what he takes himſelf for; and I have often imagined that if his inward State of Mind were detected to the Eye of the World, it would afford a ridiculous Contraſt between his ſeveral Foibles and his fancied Elevation above the reſt of his Species. For my Part, it never fails to divert me in a moſt exquiſite Manner, when I obſerve a Man ſit like his Grandſire cut in Alabaſter, as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has it, in order to receive the Compliments of every one, without any real Merit to deſerve them, and without that reciprocal Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which is always ſure to procure Eſteem. I would have ſuch a one made Emperor of the Moon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to ſome other Sphere fitted for his Reception,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0311400902:40"/>where Cruelty may paſs for Courage, Oſtentation for Merit, and Pride for Dignity.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can ſo ſurely demonſtrate a narrow Mind, as an Attempt to degrade our Fellow-Creatures by an haughty Arrogance of Carriage. <hi>Hamlet</hi> reckons the <hi>Inſolence of Office</hi> and the <hi>proud Man</hi>'s <hi>Contumely</hi> among thoſe Inſtigations which might prompt injured Merit to a Deed of extreme Deſpair, and this further enforces the Severity, which is felt by him, who is obliged to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, and the Cruelty of that human Brute who can think of putting it in Practice.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſmiſs this Paper without obſerving that there is a right Species of Pride to which every Man is entitled, and that is a Spirit above Dependance, above Flattery, above an abject Deportment, and above every Thing poor, ſordid, and little. There is a Pride, which may ſerve to invigorate Honour, to embolden Truth, and to carry Virtue to an higher Pitch of Improvement, than it might attain unaſſiſted by this ſecondary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The Pleaſures reſulting from this Principle are manly and noble. To enjoy the inward Conſciouſneſs of Honor and Honeſty, and to exult in the Conviction of a Perſon's own Integrity, Probity and upright Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is juſt and laudable. Thus much of Pride every one has a Right to, and I know no external Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that can reaſonably entitle any Man alive to more.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a former Eſſay, I threw together a few Thoughts upon the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of an ACTOR; as a Sequel to that Piece, I ſhall this Day offer ſome looſe Hints upon the <hi>Art;</hi> and though this Subject may not be intereſting to every Reader, I yet perſuade myſelf, as the Drama is the moſt polite and rational of our Diverſions, that an Attempt to throw ſome Light upon the Matter, will be received with Candour.</p>
                  <p>The Precept, which the judicious Author of my Motto has laid down for the good Writer, is likewiſe the beſt Rule for an Actor; for as both are Profeſſors
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0311400902:42"/>of imitative Arts, the ſame Rule is applicable to each. "I would recommend," ſays <hi>Horace,</hi> 
                     <q>to the ſkilful Imitator a cloſe and ſteady Obſervance of Men and Manners, and from that Source, I would have him draw an exact Reſemblance, and the true Language of Nature.</q> This Advice, ſhort and ſimple as it is, contains the whole Secret of ſucceeding with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; and whoever artfully conforms to it, will be ſure of acquiring Applauſe from crowded Theatres. The Actor, in every Situation on the Stage, is a Copyiſt from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life; the eaſy and genteel Deportment of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is to be attained by an Intercourſe and free Communication with People of that Claſs; the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Room muſt be viſited for a Knowledge of the Eaſe and Dignity of Men of Rank; and by this Habitude, the Performer will faſhion himſelf into a Kind of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Elegance, which will not ſail to inform his whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſet off every Action, with a graceful Facility, at the ſame Time that it will enable him to be upon all Occaſions, a more perfect Imitator.</p>
                  <p>To theſe external Circumſtances muſt be joined, a cloſe and intimate Knowledge of the human Heart; its moſt ſecret Movements muſt be unfolded, and the Actor muſt be thoroughly acquainted with their minuteſt Effects upon the human Body, in what Proportion they agitate the Nerves and Muſcles; how they impreſs the Features with their reſpective Signatures, elevate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Brow, brace or relax the Sinews, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Attitude and Diſpoſition of the whole Perſon. There is not a Paſſion, in the whole Train of thoſe Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to which our Nature is ſubject, but what has its own peculiar Adjuncts, its own Air, its own Look, and its own proper Tone. Sorrow unnerves the whole Syſtem, ſinks the Spirits, and depreſſes the Voice into a plaintive Melancholy; Anger, on the other Hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts each Sinew, ſends the Spirits in a Blaze to the Eye, and vents itſelf in precipitate and vehement Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0311400902:43"/>In like Manner, every Emotion of the Soul has a ſympathetic Influence on the Structure of the Body, and it is the immediate Buſineſs of the Performer, who would aſpire to Excellence in the Art, to form to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an exact Definition of each Paſſion, with all its Characteriſtics; otherwiſe it will be impoſſible for him to mark the Progreſs and Workings of the Mind, awakened and excited by the Vehemence of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, or to ſeparate the tender Deſire of a <hi>Romeo</hi> from the conjugal Affection of <hi>Jaffier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After having thus diſtinguiſhed the Nature and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of each Affection, the next Step to be taken, is, to watch the various Shiftings and Veerings of the Soul, and to obſerve how the ſeveral Paſſions riſe and fall, in quick Viciſſitude. The Mind of Man cannot dwell for any conſiderable Time upon one Object; from whence it reſults, that, Love and Reſentment, Grief and Joy, Deſpair and Hope, Rage and Tenderneſs, are perpetually taking their Turns in the Breaſt. To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive minutely the very Point where the firſt ceaſes, and the ſucceeding one begins to riſe, requires a nice Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; as in the well wrought Piece of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Hand, the Colours run ſo artfully into one another, that their gradual Evaneſcence from the Sight, and their growing by inſenſible Degrees into a full Glow, is only to be diſcovered by the curious Eye. If I do not miſtake, the Touch, which ſo ſkilfully blends different Colours in this delicate Confederacy, is called by the Painters the <hi>Demi-tint;</hi> ſhould not ſomething like this be preſerved, in the Performances of a good Actor, in order to render each Tranſition graceful and natural, to melt the Audience by regular Eſſays into Tenderneſs, or induce any other Impreſſion with Juſtneſs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety? Whatever Paſſion has at any Time taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Heart, muſt abate by Degrees, and the Traces of it muſt be almoſt effaced, before a contrary Affection can gain Admittance; and whoever is careful
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0311400902:44"/>to mark with Feeling, the Ebbing out of the one, and Flowing in of the other, will be always ſure to have an irreſiſtible Command over his Audience.</p>
                  <p>But the Matter does not reſt here; the Performer, who is ambitious of diſtinguiſhing himſelf for maſterly Touches in Scenes of Vehemence, will find another la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Secret, in the intellectual Syſtem, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eſcape his Notice. It muſt be remembered, that there are frequent Occaſions, in which the Breaſt is diſtracted by two different Paſſions at once, both working the Heart-ſtrings in one mixed Emotion. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Agitations of the Mind are often imperceptible to all but the ſkilful Obſerver; and, therefore, as the Actor's chief Difficulty lies in this Point, a feeling Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it will always be a Proof of his Excellence, and Strokes of this Nature, well executed, will impreſs on every Breaſt the livelieſt Senſations.</p>
                  <p>It often happens in mere deſcriptive Poetry, that the Writer obſerving ſome ſurprizing Agreement between Things, which in their Natures ſeem totally inconſiſtent with each other, from thence takes occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Contrarieties in ſuch an agreeable Aſſemblage, that the taſteful Reader is entertained with a Picture, which at once amuſes his Fancy and ſatisfies his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Virgil</hi> has many delicate Touches of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>Horace,</hi> who had Art enough for every poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Embelliſhment, has heightened his Odes with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Beauties of this Sort. In this Claſs of Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may be reckoned the following Paſſages;

If I might be allowed to carry this Hint further, I ſhould call all Strokes of this Kind, where the Mind is worked into a Ferment, by the Name of <hi>thwarting Paſſions;</hi> and I will venture to ſay, that they will be univerſally acknowledged much more beautiful than that mere Claſh of Ideas, which the eminent Critic juſt mentioned has ſo much inſided upon; becauſe they not only ſurprize with a ſeeming Contraſt, but alſo intereſt the Heart; which is the Perfection of Poetry. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, and indeed the fine Writers among the Moderns, are full of theſe pathetic Repreſentations of human Nature; but among them all, I do not remember a finer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than a Paſſage in Mr. <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Roman Father,</hi> when that Hero is reflecting on the Combat, which is to decide the Fate of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>To expreſs theſe complicated Senſations, where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paſſions at once agitate the Soul, requires ſuch a Command of Countenance and Voice, that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt Perfection of an Actor, and with a Kind of magic Power it always leads us into the moſt pleaſing Diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>If the Bounds of my Paper would admit it, I ſhould here indulge myſelf in examining our preſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, with Regard to the three Diviſions of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions above eſtabliſhed. To one, I ſhould, perhaps, aſcribe the Merit of expreſſing with proper Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0311400902:46"/>the Sentiments of haughty Anger and tyrannic Cruelty; in another I ſhould chiefly admire the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tranſition from Rage to Tenderneſs, and probably I ſhould not heſitate to ſay, of a third, that he is excellent in all Viciſſitudes of the Mind, and that in mixed Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he penetrates to the very Soul of his Hearers; and, were I to add, that, in many Situations, I have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the ſame from Mrs. <hi>Cibber,</hi> it would be but barely doing her that Juſtice, which her excellent Art deſerves.</p>
                  <p>From what has been premiſed, it will appear, that to expreſs the Emotions of the human Heart is the chief Buſineſs of an Actor, and no Account is ever to be made of Figure, Voice, or any other external Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, unleſs it be when they combine with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former's Feelings to make deeper Impreſſions on an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. I have known an Actor lengthen out the Tone of his Voice, and if it ſounded clearly, imagine his Buſineſs finely executed, when Nature and the Paſſions required that he ſhould ſpeak in another Key, and in broken, ſhort, and vehement Accents. <hi>Quinctilian</hi> has a juſt Remark on this Head "as Poets," ſays he, <q>profeſs to ſing their Works, Verſe ſhould be repeated in a Manner ſomewhat elevated above common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with a Sweetneſs properly tempered by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and not thrilling into a wanton Luxuriance of Sound, as if the Throat had been gargled for the Purpoſe.</q> I ſhall only add, a lively Imagination is the Talent, which an Actor ſhould principally culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as it is that, which excites thoſe pathetic Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without which no Man will ever ſucceed on the Stage, and with which it is hardly poſſible totally to fail.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW vain and fantaſtic are all human Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits? How unſettled and inconſtant are our Tempers; one Day pining for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſome imaginary Good, and, the next, hating ourſelves for all that Perplexity of Thought which our whimſical Deſires occaſioned in our Breaſts? How often are the ſobereſt Underſtandings diſturb'd by Agitations of Spirit about Things in themſelves of no Kind of Moment or Importance, and when once the Tumult has ſubſided, how contemptible do we appear to ourſelves, for having been ſo weak as to yield to the Impreſſion? Every Period of Life is marked with this Inconſtancy; the Child has Perplexities which the Boy laughs at; and ripened by a further Acceſſion of Years into Manhood, our previous Occupations become ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, 'till at length old Age thinks the whole a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0311400902:49"/>Series of Follies, inſenſible to its own Infirmities, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aware that the Paſſions operate at that Juncture with leſs Celerity, not becauſe Reaſon is grown ſtrong, but on Account of the enfeebled Tone of all the mental Powers; like a Weather Cock, which being grown ruſty, is not moved with every Breath of Wind, but ſlowly veers from Point to Point. I am inclined to think that the human Soul will be always in this Progreſſion, conſtantly making each Moment a Critic on the laſt, and and that as ſoon as the Spirit ſhall be unbodied, it will inſtantly ſmile at our wiſeſt Employments in this World, our deepeſt Reflections, and our moſt ſerious Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. I was engaged in this Train of Thought the other Night, and having an Imagination, which does not very ſoon detach itſelf from the Objects that have once poſſeſſed it, the ſame Scenes of Reflection diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed themſelves to me in Sleep, and formed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, not unentertaining to my Fancy.</p>
                  <p>I thought the Hemiſphere on a ſudden brightened with more than common Luſtre, a Flood of Glory diffuſing itſelf through all Creation, and from an Opening of the Heavens appeared, high exalted on a Throne, THE GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIUS OF HUMAN KIND. After a Trumpet had ſounded three Times, the following Sounds were awfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. <q>Let all thoſe fleeting Spirits, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly animated corporal Tenements, forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from their ſeveral Manſions of Retribution, and let thoſe who now ſupport a feveriſh Exiſtence upon Earth, inſtantly repair hither, diveſted of their bodily Incumbrance, and account before our dread Preſence, for the Uſe they have made of their Time, during their State of Probation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Edict was immediately obeyed, and I fancied that I had no ſooner emerged from my Tenement of Clay, than every Thing wore another Appearance, and new Faculties of Perception were aſſigned me. Vaniſhed were the original Colours, concerning which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0311400902:50"/>ſo many Volumes have been written; Wit, Taſte, Learning, Philoſophy, Mathematics, and even Money itſelf appeared an abſolute Chimaera; and ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages beginning to addreſs the Throne, I was further confirm'd in my Opinion that all was Idleneſs, Vanity, and unavailing Vexation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> declared his whole Poem to be the Rhapſody of an ever-weening Imagination: He owned his ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Councils and his Battle of the Gods, to be a Jumble of Abſurdities; his boldeſt Flights of Fancy appeared quite contemptible, and he wondered how he could ever employ his Faculties in ſtringing together ſuch wild enthuſiaſtic Reveries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> owned that he knew nothing of the firſt <hi>Good,</hi> firſt <hi>Perfect,</hi> and firſt <hi>Fair;</hi> and Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> wiſhed that, inſtead of being guided by that Pagan Philoſopher, he had made uſe of the Light of Revelation, which might have afforded him ſome faint dawning Ideas of that Truth of which he is now perfectly convinced. He added, that he did not know what he was about when he wrote his Rhapſody and many other Parts of his Performance, and that he now looked back at them with Contempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> declared his Syſtem of Logic to be nothing but an idle Scheme of laboured Perplexities, calculated to puzzle and bewilder Mankind. <hi>Pindar</hi> ſmil'd at his Olympics, and did not heſitate to ſay, that he really believed he was mad when he wrote them; and old <hi>Euclid,</hi> who, I believe never once laughed on Earth, burſt into a loud Expreſſion of Mirth, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon his Endeavours to ſquare the Circle, and his ſeveral Triangles and Quadrangles, which he owned do not contribute in any Degree to the Advancement of Virtue.</p>

                  <p>In ſhort, among all the celebrated Perſonages of Antiquity, every one accuſed himſelf of Miſapplication, and even <hi>Titus</hi> complained that he had loſt many Days.</p>
                  <p>There were thoſe who acknowledged that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew Uneaſineſs in Life, but what was occaſioned by the Succeſs of others, and that they were always completely happy, or completely miſerable by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. <hi>Poets</hi> laugh'd at all their Pains to tag a Rhyme and their Solicitude for Works which now appeared to them in a proper Light; and <hi>Criticks</hi> acknowledged that they took too much unneceſſary Trouble to deſtroy Productions of ſo periſhable a Nature. The Miſer rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>inſolvent Gold,</hi> as it is finely called by the witty Doctor <hi>Young,</hi> and his Heart expanded with Generoſity and ſocial Affection.</p>
                  <p>The ſofter Sex preſented themſelves among the Reſt on this Occaſion; but the Simper of Self-Admiration no longer diſplayed itſelf. They were not anxious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the Gloſs of their Skin, the Arrangement of a Curl, or the Diſpoſition of a Patch. The ſnowy Breaſt ceaſed to heave with ſtudied Careleſſneſs, and the Shape was not tortured a thouſand Ways, in order to look at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive in the Eye of Man. The Labours of the Toilet were now deſpiſed, and each Fair-one wondered how Dreſs could make ſo great a Part of the Buſineſs of Life; and how they could ever take ſo much Pride in periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Clay, however neatly moulded, and however tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with a pleaſing Hue. They were now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0311400902:52"/>that true Beauty dwells in the Mind; Drums, Routs and Cards were held in Contempt, and as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has it, They viewed with Scorn two Pages and a Chair. They were all aſhamed of the Falſehoold of their Friendſhips, their Tehees and Titters at a ruined Character, their ſeveral Turns of Coquetry, Diſſimulation, and all the Variety of female Artifice. In ſhort, Mankind in general owned themſelves diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cares beneath a rational Creature; and Envy, Pride, Selfiſhneſs, Perfidy and Ambition ſwell'd the vaſt Account.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Diſturbers of our Happineſs I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to ſee my Fellow Creatures relieved; and to perceive Love, Joy, and Benevolence effacing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually all Traces of former Guilt, gave me an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Delight. But I ſoon found I was not in Reality launched into Eternity, and therefore my Joy, like all Things ſubject to Time and mortal Chance, ſoon came to an End. The Fumes of Sleep were diſſipated, and I awaked from my Dream. Looſe as it is, the Reader may derive this Moral from it, that there is nothing in human Life worth the Anxiety it creates, and that it ſhould be our Buſineſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to fix thoſe Propenſities and Habits in our Souls, which we ſhall not have Occaſion hereafter to wiſh totally effaced, and which it is probable we ſhall be carrying to an higher Degree of Purity in thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are prepared for our future Exiſtence.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> PAID a Viſit, a few Days ſince, to a Lady, for whom I always entertained a very high Eſteem, on Account of a pleaſing Turn of Converſation, and many other good and agreeable Qualities, which ſhe is poſſeſſed of.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Millefont</hi> (for that is her Name) was never known to have the leaſt Propenſity to Scandal or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: She does not concern herſelf with the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Knowledge of, who and who were together at the Maſquerade, who were ſeen to interchange a few fond Regards at the Theatre, or who has lately had an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0311400902:54"/>Ill run at Play. Politeneſs, Good-nature and Affability are her characteriſtic Perfections, and ſhe is ready to allow Wit and Beauty in others, as well as in her own Daughters; though in my Opinion, it is a rare Thing to ſee them equalled by any of their Sex. Both the young Ladies are tall and graceful; elegant in Shape and delicate in their Features; extremely like each other in the Turn of the Face, and ſtill each of them forming, if I may be allowed to uſe the Phraſe, a different School of Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Harriet,</hi> being two Years elder, is rather more formed and higher in Bloom than her Siſter, but ſeems to be ſenſible of the approaching Eclipſe which her Beauty muſt ſuffer very ſhortly, when all the Charms, which are at preſent budding forth in the Perſon of <hi>Charlot,</hi> have attained their full Perfection. Tho' <hi>Harriet</hi> is ſenſible of this, ſhe yet perceives it without any Proneneſs to Envy. On the contrary ſhe rallies herſelf with great Vivacity, and will fairly own that ſhe is upon the Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out for a Man for herſelf, before <hi>Charlot</hi> becomes ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous a Beauty, as to engroſs the Attention of every Beholder; and then, ſays ſhe, <q>I ſhall loſe all my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, and ſo I'm reſolved to get married out of the Way.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this Account ſhe at preſent throws the Dart like a Tyrant, as the Poet phraſes it, though I am convinced when ſhe reſigns her Perſon, her good Senſe will then lead her to imitate the Gentleneſs and amiable Diſpoſition of <hi>Charlot</hi> who does not aim at being ſo fierce a Beauty as <hi>Harriet,</hi> but is chiefly deſirous to be Miſtreſs of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hearts. She does not endeavour to kindle her Eyes into that Glare of Fire, for which many others are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, but unambitiouſly ſhe lets them ſhine in their own native Mildneſs; and if the captivates every Heart it is without any premeditated Deſign. In ſhort, the Difference between theſe two young Ladies is this;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0311400902:55"/>
                     <hi>Charlot</hi>'s Charms have a conſtant Emanation, and <hi>Harriet</hi>'s Beauties are in a perpetual Exertion.</p>
                  <p>I ſpent an Hour in the moſt agreeable Manner with this Family, when <hi>Harriet</hi> in her giddy Manner gave a new Turn to the Converſation by aſking me, <q>Pray, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> can you tell me ſomething about <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>'s new Scheme; pray what is the Man about?</q> —To this I replied, that I really was not ſufficiently in the Secret; that he has built two magnificent Rooms, and intends to furniſh them in an elegant Manner; the Apartment on the Ground-Floor to be a public Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Room, and the other for the Reception of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Rank and Education; but that, however, I was afraid he would ſhare the common Fate of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Well, I vow and proteſt, ſays <hi>Harriet,</hi> it's a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Thing to ſee how theſe Men are always contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Places for their own Accommodation, without Troubling their Heads about the Women. The odious Things are always herding with one another, and the Ladies are ſequeſtred from all the Joys of theſe convenient Meetings. Does not one hear them eternally ſaying with an Air of Indifference, Ma'am I muſt go the Coffee houſe, and ſo ſaunter away with that janty careleſs Air, that never fails to provoke me? — Well, I wiſh the Women would agree to have a Coffee-houſe of their own, to be revenged of the Fellows—Lord, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> it would do charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; don't you think ſo Siſter?—It would ſo tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize the Creatures, to ſee us going into a Place, where none of them can gain Admittance—they would be ſo proud to wait at the Door to hand us to our Chairs; and it would be ſuch a Pleaſure to go and meet one's Acquaintance without going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in a ſtiff Dreſs to Routs and Drums; dear <hi>Ranger,</hi> you muſt give us an helping Hand; you muſt give us an Eſſay upon it, you wild Devil.</q> With this ſhe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0311400902:56"/>tapped me on the Shoulder, in her lively agreeable Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and inſiſted with all the Rhetoric of a Romp, that I ſhould propoſe her Scheme to the Public, which I aſſured her I ſhould take the firſt Opportunity to perform.</p>
                  <p>I have ever been of Opinion, that, in the general, Coffee-houſes, are not of ſuch Advantage as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagined, moſt of theſe Places being frequented entirely by Bucks, Bloods, and Rakes, of all Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, from whom there is nothing to be acquired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Swagger in the Gait, a drunken Totter, a noiſy riotous Deportment, a Volley of Oaths and a total Want of what is called Good Breeding. Perhaps this Opportunity of detaching themſelves from the Ladies in Coffee-houſe Clubs is the Cauſe of that Aukward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is frequently remarkable in Perſons, who from their Fortunes and Situation in Life ſhould be better accompliſhed, and on this Account I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that a Rendezvous of this Nature might have ſome ill Effect upon the Deportment of the Fair; but ſhould this Scheme be carried into Execution, I muſt acknowledge, that it will in many Reſpects ſet the Ladies upon a <hi>Par</hi> with the Men, and the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of meeting People of Faſhion, without the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Parade of going to their Houſes, will certainly be very great; alſo Appointments with each other may be fixed with Eaſe by the Means of this Inſtitution; and a Memorandum Book, placed at the Bar, as at the <hi>Bedford</hi> and other Places, may ſerve for the following Purpoſes.</p>

                  <p>BY Letters from a Correſpondent abroad, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that when Monſieur <hi>Voltaire</hi> was arreſted by order of the King of <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> there were found, among his Papers, ſeveral Tranſlations of different Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> done ſo extremely ill, that it is conjectured, he purpoſely made uſe of a frigid Languor of Expreſſion, in order to leſſen the Poet's Reputation abroad, in hopes that then himſelf might be ſet down as the greateſt dramatic Poet in the World. But to quiet this reſtleſs Ambition, we muſt inform him that <hi>Apollo</hi> has long ſince iſſued out his Prohibition, ſo that he may ſwell, like the Frog in the Fable, without ever coming near him. <hi>Non ſi te ruperis, inquit, par eris.</hi> The ſame Advices mention, that, there were alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral abuſive Paragraphs on the ſame immortal Bard, very improper from the Pen of a Scholar and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the Anſwer of a certain eminent <hi>Jew,</hi> when aſked by what Means he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated the very large Fortune, which he is ſuppoſed to be poſſeſſed of, that he had more Difficulty in acquiring the firſt Three Thouſand Pounds, than all the Reſt of his immoderate Wealth. This Apothegm may be ſaid to comprize the whole Arcanum of riſing in the World, but as not one of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0311400902:60"/>Adepts in the Science has thought proper to diſcover the ſecret Art of putting this Rule in Practice, it is to be apprehended, the Indigent will find as many Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as ever to retard their Progreſs, and hinder them from emerging out of their Embarraſſments. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of my Motto has obſerved, many Ages ſince, that the moſt exalted Virtues, and the rareſt Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not find it eaſy to extricate themſelves out of Difficulties; and the Courſe of human Contingencies has proved the Maxim true to this Day.</p>
                  <p>There is perhaps hardly any Man, but can point out in the Circle of his Acquaintance certain Perſonages of very extenſive Capacities, ſtrong and quick Parts, and a delicate Senſe of Honour, who are not however able to raiſe themſelves to any conſpicuous Point of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, merely becauſe their Talents have not been called forth by Opportunity, or animated by Succeſs. Genius wherever it ſubſiſts, muſt be warmed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, otherwiſe it is apt to languiſh and decay; the fine Senſations, which are attendant on an enlightened Underſtanding, occaſion a certain Delicacy in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor's Way of thinking, which renders him liable to a Dejection of Spirits upon many Occaſions in Life. Refined Parts ſhould be tenderly preſerved, or they are liable to be chilled by the Blaſts of Adverſity; like thoſe Fruits, which would wither unripened in our cold northern Clime, were they not carefully aſſiſted in their Vegetation by the adventitious Uſe of hot Beds.</p>
                  <p>The Circumſtance, which in my Opinion reflects the greateſt Luſtre upon the Character of Lord <hi>Sommers,</hi> is the Encouragement he afforded to ſuch a Genius as Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> who might have remained in a leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Point of View without the Aſſiſtance of ſuch a Patron. His Vein of Humour, which is now the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeleſt in the World, might have taken a Tincture from low Life; his delicate Raillery might have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided into coarſe and vulgar Railing; His Taſte, which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0311400902:61"/>was finiſhed by Travel and every other Advantage, might have grown quite callous and indelicate: for his Sentiments of Morality might have been ſubſtituted a Strain of Ribaldry, to awaken the Blum of Confuſion in that female Face, which, as Matters happened, he took ſo much Pains to ſet off in the Smiles of native Innocence and unaffected Beauty; and that Pen, which entertained the Town with ſome of the moſt elegant Productions of human Wit, might have been employed in Politics, perſonal Invective, and Party-rage. But the kindly Protection of the Lord <hi>Sommers</hi> hindered him from ſinking into Obſcurity, and from being compelled by Neceſſity to ſully that fair Fame, which is now the Reward of his excellent Performances. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſo eminent a Perſon was a Kind of Demand upon him, for all that elaborate Elegance, which now diſtinguiſhes itſelf in his Writings.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>He from the Taſte obſcene refines our Youth,</l>
                     <l>And ſets the Paſſions on the Side of Truth.</l>

                  <p>It has been the Fate of many, endowed perhaps with Parts not very inferior to <hi>Addiſon,</hi> to droop in Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, their poetic Fires totally extinguiſhed, and I make no Manner of Doubt, but in the preſent Age, there are thoſe who might become ſhining Ornaments of the Republic of Letters, were there any Incitement to ſpur the Muſes Steed. But a Treatiſe on <hi>Cribbidge,</hi> or a Calculation of the Chances at Whiſt, is ſure of being better received at preſent, than the Odes of a <hi>Collins,</hi> or any Performance of diſtinguiſhed Genius. While a <hi>Smart</hi> ſubſiſts among us, I cannot help thinking it an indelible Reproach to the Age, that he has not any where ſound a <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and that he is ſuffered to draw his Pen in the Praiſes of his Maker, without receiving any other Reward, than a ſmall Premium at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and that Portion of Fame, which, in Spight of Malice and Envy, he will be always ſure to enjoy.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0311400902:62"/>Wit is generally conſidered as an Object of Ridicule rather than an Accompliſhment deſerving Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eſteem, and the Narrowneſs of Fortune, in which moſt of the literary Tribe are ſituated, is a ſtanding Topic of Pleaſantry, and to call a Man a Poet, is, in moſt Companies, a ſtroke of irreſiſtible Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.

                  <p>There is hardly any Thing more affecting to a Man of real Merit, than to find himſelf ſcorned by the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Purſe-pride. People of Affluence ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider when they attempt to depreciate Men of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Parts, that they betray an unmanly Triumph over thoſe, who have ſtill their Fortune to make. But, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> finely obſerves, the World in general is apt to form an Idea of a Man, at the Time he is leaſt able to make a proper Judgment for himſelf; and from thence it reſults, that we find many utterly ruined by ſlight Errors, trivial Indiſcretions, and petty Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies, while others owe their Elevation to Vices, to headſtrong Paſſions, and a Series of ſelfiſh Views, which are, for the greater Part, more ſucceſsful, than Modeſty, a ſober Underſtanding, and a Spirit above abject Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and mean Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>They who ſit ſmiling at the Goal of Fortune, while others are running the hardy Courſe, ſhould reflect, that it is poſſible for Perſeverance and unremitted Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, to reach the very Point, in which they take ſo much Pride; and then it is evident on which Side the Superiority will be found. A well turned Spirit, with the Advantages of a genteel Education and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Knowledge of the World, muſt certainly receive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0311400902:63"/>additional Luſtre from an Acceſſion of Wealth, and the Accompliſhments of ſuch a one, will, in their Turn, adorn and embelliſh Affluence. On this Account, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi>'s Maxim is without Diſpute, highly juſt; a great Reſpect, ſays he, is due to Youth. The Practice of this Obſervation I would recommend to all Parents, Uncles, Guardians, and all Ranks of People, who have any Concern in the Education of the riſing Generation; as it is to be apprehended that they frequently, by too much Precipitance in their Conduct, drive them to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, which a little Indulgence might prevent, and by which they might become valuable Members of Society.</p>

In travelling through an open champain Country the Proſpect on every Side may adminiſter to the Pleaſures of Imagination; but a Man will certainly feel more lively Senſat ons when riding upon Land belonging to himſelf; the Landſkip of his own Eſtate will look more beautiful to the Eye, the Lawn ſhall ſpread a more pleaſing Verdure, and the Diſcovery of a Mine, or the ſecret Spring of a little Rill running through his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, aford him a Delight not to be equalled by the gayeſt Scenes that can be preſented to him.</p>
                  <p>The Study of the human Mind is, therefore, the moſt rational and pleaſing Employment we are capable of; for my Part I am always highly delighted when any accidental Circumſtance throws me into this Tract of thinking, and whether reading <hi>Rabelais</hi>'s frolic Rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the ſublime Enthuſiaſm of <hi>Homer,</hi> I am ſure ever and anon to lay aſide the Volume, in order to trace the Pleaſure, which I have received, to its hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Source, and to account for the Appearance upon ſome Principle in our Conſtitution. An Opportunity of gratifying this Turn occurred to me the other Day, when caſually turning over ſome of the moſt beautiful Paſſages in epic Poetry, I could not help taking notice, that I peruſed the Deſcription of Thouſands ſtretched upon the Field of Battle, weltring in Blood, agonizing with their Wounds, and trampled under Horſes Hoofs, without feeling any of thoſe Propenſities to Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0311400902:66"/>which were frequently awakened in me by the Death of a ſingle Perſon. I could read with the greateſt Compoſure and Serenity, Lines, which mention dying Groans of Numbers falling in one promiſcuous Carnage, broken Limbs of Warriors, Men and Horſes, all mixed in one general Scene of Deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>The Mind is totally impaſſive in all theſe general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Calamities of War; but, when the Poet thinks proper to diſtinguiſh a ſingle Perſon from the Throng, we melt in Pity of his Fate, heedleſs of the general Devaſtation, which is ſpread around him. That this is the Caſe every Body that has read the <hi>Aeneid</hi> will be ready to acknowledge; and yet it might be imagined that our Hearts ſhould be more intenſely agitated, when Deſolation ſweeps whole Ranks of our Fellow-Creatures from the Face of the Earth, than when we read the Fate of an Individual; but ſuch is our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that we can go through all theſe Narratives without Emotion, and when the epic Writer throws out but a ſhort Reflection upon the Fall of one Man, we are inſtantly fixed in Attention, and our Hearts throb with Compaſſion for his untimely End.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of this I take to be, that in the former Caſe, we are only told, that ſo many embraced their Fate in Battle, in which Circumſtance there is nothing to excite Commiſeration in a reaſonable Being. Death is one of the Conditions of human Life, and we all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0311400902:67"/>hold our Exiſtence in this World upon the ſame preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tenure. We therefore conſider the Deſcriptions of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> as no more than a mere Bill of Mortality, and when they inform us that ſuch a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber periſhed upon the Spot, we peruſe it with as much Calmneſs as the Paragraph which tells us, <q>Encreaſed in the Burials this Week five hundred.</q> And further, when they tell us, that, one receives an Arrow in the jugular Vein; another has a Spear run through his Shoulder, and is rivetted with his Body double to the Ground; a third is wounded in the Mouth and has his Head ſplit in two, it may ſerve, as the Critics obſerve, to give Variety to the Battle, but in Fact, amounts to no more than what we read in a common News paper, <q>Yeſterday a Labourer fell from the Top of an Houſe, by which Accident he broke his Collar bone and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly expired.</q> An Account of bodily Pain has but a very ſlight Influence upon our Paſſions; it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſtreſs that principally operates upon our Hearts, and our Pity riſes in Proportion to the Agitations of Mind, which we perceive in the Perſon afflicted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the Poet frequently finds collateral Avenues to our Souls, by a Mention of Family-Connections, and to heighten our Sorrow, he addreſſes himſelf to the moral Senſe of his Reader, and intereſts him ſtill more in the Fate of his Hero, by repreſenting his amiable Qualities, and the elegant Accompliſhments, which would have rendered him a deſerving Member of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. By theſe Mears our tendereſt Feelings are awakened, and the Effect is not unlike what a Man may experience in a Church-yard, where he ſees a Multitude of different Graves in which, the good, the bad, the old and young lie in promiſcuous Silence, and he therefore beholds the Scene without Emotion; but as ſoon as the Tomb ſtone preſents a Character of one diſtinguiſhed from the Reſt, he then laments the generous Friend, the tender Huſband, the indulgent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0311400902:68"/>Father, and mourns for him who acted agreeably to the Relations in which he ſtood to his Fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Thus when we read of a dying Perſon, that he was a Friend of the Muſes, and that Harmony was the Delight of his Soul, we conſider him in a different Light from thoſe, who as Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> expreſſes it, are celebrated for nothing but being knocked in the Head.

If the Players would alſo conſider the ſame, Noiſe and Rant would be effectually baniſhed, and inſtead of aiming at Applauſe by the mere Effect of own ſonorous Voices, they would endeavour by every Look, every Tone, and every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to mark the in-felt Anguiſh of their Minds.</p>

Thus the female Beauty aims at being a general Toaſt, by detracting from ſome other Fair-one.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the laſt Meeting of our Club, my Friend, Mr. <hi>Candid,</hi> informed us, that he had lately ſeen the Character of King <hi>Lear</hi> admirably performed by Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> and that he had ſince thrown together ſome Remarks upon that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tragedy, which he deſired I would this Day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Readers of the <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn-Journal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be able to criticiſe a Poet with any Degree of Perſpicuity, it is requiſite to conſider the Nature of his Fable; and the moral Uſe of the Work. This being ſketched, we may then proceed to obſerve how he lays on his Colouring, the Diſpoſition of each Perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the Expreſſion of the Paſſions, and which is the capital Figure in the Piece. <hi>Lear</hi> being examined in this Manner, it will appear that the Author intended to exhibit, in the moſt ſtriking Colours, the horrid Crime of Filial Ingratitude. To enforce this he repreſents an old Monarch tired with the Cares of State, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſtribute his Poſſeſſions among his Daughters, in Proportion to their Affections towards his Perſon. Accordingly, the two that flatter him obtain all, the third Siſter being diſinherited for her Sincerity, and the King is at length driven by the Ingratitude of his two eldeſt Daughters, to an extreme of Madneſs, which produces the fineſt Tragic Diſtreſs ever ſeen on any Stage.</p>
                  <p>As this is the Ground-work of the Play, I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized that any Critic ſhould impute the Madneſs of <hi>Lear</hi> to the Loſs of Royalty. The Behaviour of his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0311400902:77"/>Children is always uppermoſt in his Thoughts, and we perceive it working upon his Paſſions, till at Length his Mind ſettles into a fixed Attention to that ſingle Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This, I think, will appear in a critical Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lear,</hi> in his firſt Scene, ſhews himſelf ſuſceptible of the moſt violent Emotions. The Poet has drawn him impetuous to the greateſt Degree, proud, haughty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, and tender-hearted. In ſuch a Mind it is not to be wondered that Ill-treatment ſhould excite the moſt uneaſy Senſations. He takes fire at an imaginary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Diſaffection in <hi>Cordelia.</hi>

                  <p>There have been many Poets who were acquainted in general with the Paſſions of human Nature, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find them conſtantly deſcribing their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; but <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Art ſhows their Impulſe and their Workings, without the Aid of Definition or flowery De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Beſides the general Survey of the Heart, he was more intimately verſed in the various Tempers of Mankind than any Poet whatever. We always find that he makes the Paſſions of each Perſonage in his Drama operate according to his peculiar Habit and Frame of Mind; and, in the Tragedy in Queſtion, there are ſo many Strokes of this Nature, that in my Opinion, it is his Maſter-Piece. In every Speech in <hi>Lear</hi>'s Mouth, there is ſuch an artful Mixture of thwarting Paſſions, that the Heart-ſtrings of an Audience are torn on every
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0311400902:79"/>Side. The frequent Tranſition and Shifting of Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is natural to every Breaſt, but in <hi>Lear</hi> they are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical Marks of his Temper.</p>

                  <p>As yet the Perturbation of his Mind does not ſeem fixed to a Point; he begins to moralize, but ſtill with a View to his own Afflictions, until <hi>Edgar</hi> enters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like a Madman. <hi>Lear</hi>'s firſt Queſtion is, <q>have his Daughters brought him to this Paſs? couldſt thou ſave nothing? didſt thou give them all?</q>—And this I take to be the firſt Touch of fixed Madneſs in the Play, and might point out to any Man the Cauſe of his Deſtraction, without thinking of the Reſignation of his Sceptre, or the mere Loſs of regal Power.</p>
                  <p>As our Hero is now out of his Senſes, a new Field opens itſelf to the Poet. He had before diſplay'd every Movement of the Heart, and the human Underſtanding now becomes his Province, in which, we ſhall find, he acquits himſelf with the moſt maſterly Skill. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Madmen do not ſeem to have loſt the Faculty of Reaſoning; but having joined together ſome Ideas very wrongly, they miſtake them for Truths; and they err as Men do that argue right from wrong Principles. For by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their Imaginations, having miſtaken their Fancies for Realities, they make right Deductions from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0311400902:81"/>Agreeably to this Account, <hi>Lear,</hi> upon the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Madman, takes it for granted that it is owing to his Daughters ill-treatment, and when contradicted, he replies, <q>Death! Traitor! nothing could have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Nature to ſuch a Lowneſs but his unkind Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</q>—He next takes him for a Philoſopher, and agreeably to that Notion enquires <q>what is the Cauſe of Thunder?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his next Scene a Deſire of revenging his Grievances actuates his Mind;
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>To have a thouſand with red burning Spits</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Come hizzing in upon 'em!</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> He then proceeds to arraign his Daughters in a Court of Juſtice. <q>Arraign her firſt, 'tis <hi>Gonerill.</hi> I here take Oath before this honourable Aſſembly—ſhe kicked the poor King her Father—Here is another too whoſe warpt Looks proclaim what Store her Heart is made of.</q>—He ſtill continues to dwell in Imagination upon the Crime of Ingratitude, which appears to him ſo ſhocking that he exclaims, <q>Let them anatomize <hi>Regan;</hi>—ſee what breeds about her Heart—Is there any Cauſe in Nature for theſe hard Hearts?</q> This laſt Stroke cannot fail to draw Tears from every Eye. The Reader will pleaſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that all this Time there is not a Word ſaid of his Royalty, on the contrary, he ſays to <hi>Edgar,</hi> 
                     <q>You, Sir, I entertain for one of my Hundred; only I do not like the Faſhion of your Garment,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hundred, was appointed after his Abdication.</p>
                  <p>After this how was <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> to repreſent <hi>Lear</hi> again ſo as to keep up the Paſſions, and heighten the Diſtreſs? By taking Advantage of every Circumſtance in <hi>Lear</hi>'s Temper. He had ſaid that he would reaſſume the Shape, he had caſt off: This then remained untouched, and accordingly in the next Scene we perceive him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually putting it in Execution, and his Fancy ſuggeſts to him, that he is a King; from which he reaſons as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0311400902:82"/>from every other Principle, and always with an Eye to his Children. "No," they cannot touch me for "coining; I am the King himſelf." <q>There's my Gauntlet—I'll prove it on a Giant.</q> From this, his Imagination wanders. <q>Bring up the brown Bills— O well flown Barb! i'th' Clout! i'th' Clout— Hewgh, give the Word.</q>—From this Rambling he ſoon returns, and the habitual Ideas again take Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of him. <q>Ha <hi>Regan! Gonerill!</hi> they flattered me like a Dog,</q> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this, <hi>Glo'ſter</hi> enquiring if it is not the King, he catches at the Word and anſwers, "Ay, every Inch a King." And then he draws ſome more Inferences from that Notion, till he reflects that <hi>Glo'ſter</hi>'s Baſtard Son was kinder to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his own Daughters, got in lawful Sheets. From this he digreſſes into an Invective againſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and continues raving, till at length his Spirit of Revenge returns upon him. <q>And when I've ſtolen upon theſe SONS-IN-LAW, then kill, kill, kill, kill.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Art to reſerve his being crowned with Straw for the laſt Scene of his Madneſs, as it is a Repreſentation of human Nature reduced to the loweſt Ebb. Had he loſt his Reaſon on Account of his abdicated Throne, the Emotions of Pity would not be ſo intenſe, as they now are when we ſee him drove to that Extreme by the Cruelty of his own Children. Every Topic of parental Diſtreſs being exhauſted, and all the King's Maſter-Paſſions diſplayed in his Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Poet judiciouſly ſhews him gradually coming to himſelf in the next Scene; and we ſee the Ideas dawning ſlowly on his Soul.
<q>
                        <hi>Where have I been?—where am I?—fair Day-light!</hi>
                     </q> In this Recollection of his Reaſon, he never once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Loſs of Royalty, but again touches upon the Cauſe of his Diſtreſs in his Speech to <hi>Cordelia.</hi>

                        <p>TO addreſs a Letter to you under the Character of of Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> I am perſuaded needs little Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; eſpecially when it goes from one, who, though a Stranger to you, has a real Regard to your Reputation as an Author, and having often received great Pleaſure from your Weekly Eſſays, takes this Liberty of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Thoughts to you on a Piece of Criticiſm in which he differs with you is Opinion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0311400902:86"/>Your Paper of laſt <hi>Saturday</hi> an Examen of King <hi>Lear,</hi> and you think many Critics have miſtaken the principal Idea in the old King's Mind during his State of Madneſs: After citing <hi>Lear's</hi> Exclamation on the Ingratitude of his Daughters you add, <q>This might lead any Man to the Cauſe of <hi>Lear</hi>'s Madneſs, without thinking of the Reſignation of his Sceptre.</q> But certainly, whoever conſiders <hi>Lear</hi>'s Character with Attention, will from the very Paſſage you quote, beſide an hundred others, think there is much to be ſaid on the other Side of the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>I have read with great Pleaſure ſeveral of the Remarks you make on the Speeches in <hi>Lear,</hi> which are ſuch as can ariſe only in the Mind of a Reader of Taſte; but I cannot agree, that <q>
                              <hi>He muſt be unfeeling to the great Art of our Poet, who can look for any other Cauſe of Diſtreſs,</hi>
                           </q> in the Madneſs of the King, than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of his Daughters.</p>
                        <p>I know not in what Manner you may treat the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks I am about to make, but I can ſincerely aſſure you, they are only intended as Hints to yourſelf, on a Subject which I think of ſome Conſequence to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Critic in the <hi>Adventurer</hi> was ſomewhat wanting in Juſtice to the Poet, by mentioning the Loſs of Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the ſole Cauſe of <hi>Lear</hi>'s Madneſs, without taking Notice at the ſame Time of the forcible Idea he muſt have of the Ingratitude of his two Daughters; and I think Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> alſo wrong, in excluding intirely his Opinion. What I purpoſe here is, to point out <hi>both the Ideas</hi> working ſtrongly in his Mind, and what the Author intended as conducive to the Moral of his Play.</p>
                        <p>No Critic on <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> can better explain the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters he draws, than the Poet himſelf does in every Speech; we not only ſee what his Perſons are during the Scene repreſented, but we are alſo made acquainted by ſome nice Touches in each Play, with their former Mode of thinking and acting; and as no Poet ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0311400902:87"/>Nature better in the Operation of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo he always makes them ſpeak and act in the higheſt Conformity to their Characters: In this Reſpect his Genius and Judgment is every where equal to <hi>Horace</hi>'s Precept,
<q>
                              <hi>Aetatis cujuſque notandi ſunt tibi Mores.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lear</hi>'s Deportment and Sentiments in regard to his Daughters in the firſt Act, and what <hi>Gonerill</hi> ſays of him to <hi>Regan,</hi> mark very plainly his Character; which is, that of <hi>a haughty, paſſionate, inconſtant, weak old Man.</hi> He does not reſign his Authority to his Daughters ſo much out of Love to them, as to rid himſelf of the Cares of Government—He retains the Name of King with a ſuitable Train of Attendants—He ſtill commands with his former Impetuoſity of Temper, and is jealous even of Trifles. This the ill natured Character of the Daughters will not ſuffer, and they are in Conſultation in the moſt undutiful and unbecoming Manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his remaining Shew of Power: Their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Ingratitude ſoon appear in the moſt glaring Inſtances, and make the old King ſorely ſenſible, that he had <hi>given them</hi> ALL.—</p>
                        <p>Nature was <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Guide, he deſcribes the Imagination affected by concurring Cauſes to pave the Way for a Scene of the higheſt Diſtreſs—<hi>Lear,</hi> as a King and Father feels with great Senſibility the Shocks, of his Daughters Ingratitude and unnatural Treatment, and exhibits a moving Picture of the Feelings of the Heart, and the various Conflicts of Paſſions very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of his Character and Circumſtances; if the Poet had nothing more in view, he might have been well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the maſterly Picture he has drawn of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, Grief, and Rage in every Scene before the Loſs of his Senſes; but he has crowned the Diſtreſs by making him at laſt fix his Imagination on his own Raſhneſs and Folly in giving away his ALL, and putting it out of his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0311400902:88"/>Power to avenge himſelf. And 'tis this Reflection chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drives him to Madneſs.</p>
                        <p>The jeſting of his Fool wholly turns upon his <hi>unking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf</hi> and retaining <hi>nothing,</hi> which <hi>Lear</hi> minutely attends to, and ſays, "A bitter Fool!—After <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerill</hi>'s Propoſal to reduce his Train, he breaks out, <hi>"Woe! that too late repents."</hi>—Then the Ingratitude of his Daughters and his own Folly deeply ſtrike him.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>—O Lear, Lear, Lear!</l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Beat at this Gate that let thy Folly in,</hi>

                           </l>
                           <l>Afterwards he ſays to <hi>Gonerill,</hi>

                           </l>
                           <l>In the next Scene, wrapt up in Thought, he ſays,</l>
                           <l>To TAKE 'T AGAIN PERFORCE!—<hi>Monſter Ingratitude!</hi>
                           </l>

                        <p>In this Line the two Ideas are ſtrongly blended, and the <hi>Loſs of Power</hi> foremoſt, for ſurely that was the obvious Reaſon of the Inſults he had received; if he had ſtill been in Poſſeſſion, they would have continued to ſprinkle him with <hi>Court Holy-water:</hi> The Fool, whoſe Phraſe the laſt is, ſays,

                              <l>
                                 <hi>Fathers that wear Rags,</hi>

                              <l>
                                 <hi>Do make their Children blind;</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>But Fathers that bear Bags,</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Shall ſee their Children kind,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I muſt here take Notice of the different Colouring uſed by our Poet, and all good Writers, in diſtinguiſhing the Characters of Men ſeemingly agitated by the ſame Paſſions. <hi>Lear</hi>'s Idea of his Folly, in diveſting himſelf of his Authority, is nicely and artfully diſtinguiſhed by <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> from that Kind of Regret, which an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Man of a different Character would feel from the Deprivation of Power.—He is full of the Loſs of his Dignity, only as it was the Occaſion of the ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he met with, and not from a Thirſt of Rule.—
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0311400902:89"/>This Idea and that of the Ingratitude of his Daughters, which he feels as the Conſequence of it, I cannot help thinking, are as cloſely united in his Madneſs, as two Twigs twiſted together, and growing out of the ſame Stem.</p>
                        <p>When he exclaims and reproaches his Daughters in that heart-piercing Scene of Diſtreſs on the Heath, he ſays,
<q>
                              <l>O Regan! O Gonerill!</l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Your old kind Father! whoſe frank Heart</hi> gave all—</l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>O that Way Madneſs lies—Let me ſhun</hi> THAT—</l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>No more of</hi> THAT—</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>On his Recollection that he <hi>gave all,</hi> he breaks ſhort and immediately ſubjoins, "O that Way Madneſs lies; let me ſhun <hi>that;</hi> no more of <hi>that;—i. e.</hi> Let me not think that I have been guilty of ſo much Folly, as to have given <hi>all</hi> to ſuch ungrateful Wretches—the Reflection will make me mad.</p>
                        <p>I know it may be inſiſted on by you, and perhaps by many others, that <hi>Lear</hi> makes uſe of the Sentiment of <hi>giving all,</hi> only to tax the Ingratitude of his Daughters in a higher Degree; but, tis poſſible, you may be of a contrary Opinion, if you can allow, that the Moral of this Play, does not expoſe the Ingratitude of Children, more than the Folly of Parents. <hi>This ſame Folly of Parents</hi> is alſo touched with great Judgment in the Under-plot of <hi>Glo'ſter;</hi> and the Characters of <hi>Lear</hi>'s two Daughters are finely contraſted with thoſe of <hi>Cordelia</hi> and <hi>Edgar;</hi> and the Poet's Deſign in marking out ſo ſtrongly the Folly and ill-judged Partiality of Parents is confirmed by the Behaviour of <hi>Edmund</hi>—</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Lear</hi> ſees the Wretchedneſs of <hi>Edgar,</hi> he purſues the ſame Train of Reaſoning which before poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt him, and aſks, <q>
                              <hi>Didſt thou</hi> GIVE ALL <hi>to thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!—And art thou to come to this?</hi>
                           </q> And immediately after,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0311400902:90"/>
                           <q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>What! Have his Daughters brought him to this Paſs?</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Could'ſt thou</hi> ſave nothing?—<hi>did'ſt thou</hi> give them all?</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is agreeable to his Character—And from all that we hear in common Life (for there are many Stories) of old weak Parents, who have acted much in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Lear,</hi> and to the Reproach of human Nature, have met with Ingratitude and Diſobedience; theſe, I ſay, in their Feeling-hours of Diſtreſs, are reported to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached themſelves with their Folly in GIVING ALL, as well as exclaimed againſt the Ingratitude of their Children.</p>
                        <p>There are many Characters, I doubt not, now in the World, who retain a Heap of Treaſure, uſeleſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from their Children, on no better Motives, than to inſure their Duty and Attention; and ſome who carry the Moral of this Play to a ridiculous Height, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Children an Independance, merely on the ſame Parity of Reaſoning, without conſidering the Difference between the Prudence of Parents and their Folly.</p>
                        <p>I FORBEAR making any Quotations from <hi>Lear</hi>'s Speeches in his Madneſs. I think the Whole obvious enough, and that our immortal Poet, who had a perfect Knowledge of the Workings of the human Mind, has drawn <hi>both the Ideas</hi> in <hi>Lear</hi>'s Madneſs, agreeable to the Repreſentation he has made of him in the firſt Act.</p>
                        <p>What I have hitherto ſaid, is entirely confined to the different Opinions of Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> and the <hi>Adventurer;</hi> nor do I expect that you ſhall alter your's in Conformity to my Judgment.—Let a diligent Examination of the Play determine you in the future Criticiſms you intend to give the Public on this Subject.</p>
                        <p>WHAT has often occurr'd to me, in reading over the ſeveral Editions of our Poet, and what has been ſaid by you, and many great Geniuſſes, only ſerve to convince me of the Difficulty of any one Man's ſucceeding in a perfect Criticiſm on <hi>Shakeſpear;</hi> at leaſt, I have Reaſon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0311400902:91"/>to think ſo, from what I have ſeen of the ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that have been made by different Commentators from the Time of Mr. <hi>Rowe,</hi> to the mutilated Condition our Poet was thrown into by ſubſequent Editors.</p>
                        <p>Several Perſons have ſucceeded in illuſtrating many of the Characters he draws, and have pointed out to public Notice, many of his latent Beauties; but, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <q>
                              <hi>there is ſcarce one Man alive</hi> (to ſpeak in the Stile of a very extraordinary Addreſs to a great Man, in laſt <hi>Saturday's Inſpector) who is even capable of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Beauties by their proper Names,</hi> much leſs of <hi>exhibiting them all with Advantage to the Public;</hi> whoſe Property <hi>they now are, if they will acquire a Taſte to enjoy 'em.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I can't forbear mentioning the Obligation which the Public has to the Genius of Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> who has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited with great Luſtre many of the moſt ſhining Strokes of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s amazing Art; and may be juſtly ſtiled (as he was once called by you) his beſt Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator: For 'tis certain, he has done our Poet more Juſtice by his Manner of playing his principal Characters, than any Editor has yet done by a Publication.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall conclude with the ſame Freedom as I began, by deſiring you will conſider my Manner of treating this Subject, as the mere Hints of a friendly Letter, and not as an Eſſay on the Subject in Diſpute.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH I have in my two laſt Papers entirely confined the Attention of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to critical Enquiries, I ſhall make no Apology for offering another Eſſay this Day upon a Subject nearly connected with thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the more eſpecially as the Honour of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is in ſome Sort concerned in the preſent Lucubration againſt a <hi>French</hi> Writer, upon whom I have formerly animadverted, and who has taken in ſome Paſſages of his Works, unbecoming Liberties with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Prefixed to <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s <hi>Merope,</hi> we find a Letter to <hi>Maffei</hi> (the Author of an <hi>Italian</hi> Tragedy on the ſame Subject) in which that Writer, after mentioning a faulty Piece which was performed on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers himſelf in the following Words. <hi>Elle fut ſans doute mal reque; mais n'eſt il pas bien etrange qu'on l'ait repreſentie? N'eſt ce pas une preuve que le Teatre</hi> Angloiſe <hi>n'eſt pas encore epuré? Il ſemble que la méme cauſe qui prive les</hi> Angloiſe <hi>du Genie de la Painture &amp; de la Muſique, leur óte auſſi celui de la Tragedie. Cette Iſle, qui a produit les plus grand Philoſophes de la Terre, n'eſt pas auſſi fertile pour les beaux Arts; &amp; ſi les</hi> Anglois <hi>ne s'appliquent ſerienſement a ſuivre les Preceptes de leurs excellens Citoyens</hi> Addiſon &amp; Pope, <hi>ils n'approcherent pas des autres Peuples en fait de Gout &amp; de Literature.</hi> 
                     <q>The <hi>Engliſh Merope,</hi> (ſays <hi>Voltaire,</hi>) acted in the Year 1731, was not well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0311400902:94"/>received; but is it not ſurpriſing that it was exhibited at all? May we not infer from thence, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Stage has not as yet attained a due Degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement? It looks as if the ſame Cauſe, which has deprived the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of a Genius for Painting and Muſic, has alſo withheld from them the Spirit of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Poetry. That Iſland which has produced the greateſt Philoſophers in the World, is not ſo happy with Regard to the polite Arts, and unleſs they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly attach themſelves to the Precepts of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Countrymen, <hi>Addiſon</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> they will be thrown at a Diſtance by other Nations in Point of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature and Productions of Taſte.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe the Managers of a Theatre ſuffered a bad Piece to be repreſented, is it not unfair to derive from thence a Charge of Indelicacy upon a whole Nation, more particularly when the Reception this Piece met with from the Public is rather an Indication of a correct and juſt Taſte?—</p>
                  <p>What the Cauſe is, which has deprived the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of a Genius for Painting and Muſic, I am at a Loſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Certain it is, thoſe Arts flouriſhed for a long Time in <hi>Italy,</hi> before they came over the <hi>Alps</hi> to our northern Regions; and it is certain that a Taſte for them has prevailed many Years ſince in this Kingdom. They have been cultivated here with the greateſt Delicacy by ſeveral eminent Maſters, though we cannot boaſt as many exalted Geniuſſes as have adorned the ſofter Clime of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Transfiguration by <hi>Raphael,</hi> the Nativity by <hi>Corregio,</hi> and the laſt Judgment by <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> will perhaps never be matched any where elſe; but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to deduce a Concluſion from thence, that we have no Genius for this excellent imitative Art in <hi>England.</hi> Portrait-Painting has been in as great a Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this Country as in any other Part of the World. Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller</hi> found ſo much Taſte among us, that he made this his own Country; and here—

                     <hi>But not to ſneak from living worth to dead,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> finely expreſſes it, whoever, has obſerved with Attention the Performances of <hi>Hayman,</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s Charge of a Want of Taſte is perfectly groundleſs. Every Thing is put out of Hand by this excellent Artiſt with the utmoſt Grace and Delicacy, and his Hiſtory-Pieces have, beſides their beautiful Colouring, the moſt lively Expreſſion of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. <hi>Hutſon</hi>'s Rooms teem with mimic Life; and <hi>Hogarth,</hi> like a true Genius, has formed a new School of Painting for himſelf. He may be truly ſtiled the <hi>Cervantes</hi> of his Art, as he has exhibited the ridiculous Follies of human Nature with the moſt exquiſite Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and he may be ſaid to be the firſt, who has wrote Comedy with his Pencil. His <hi>Harlot's Progreſs,</hi> and <hi>Marriage A-la mode</hi> are, in my Opinion, as well drawn as any Thing in <hi>Moliere,</hi> and the Unity of Character, which is the Perfection of Dramatic Poetry, is ſo ſkilfully preſerved, that we are ſurprized to ſee the ſame Perſonage thinking agreeably to his complexional Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in the many different Situations, in which we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perceive him. The Frible, the Bully, the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, the Lawyer, the Miſer, and in ſhort all the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Characters in Life are, by this Gentleman, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably depicted upon Canvas, that I am convinced <hi>Voltaire</hi> would be at a Loſs to ſhew where he has been equalled by any of his Countrymen.—</p>
                  <p>We may alſo boaſt an equal Excellence in Muſic; for though Mr. <hi>Handell</hi> is not an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> it is however a convincing Proof of our national Taſte, that we have made it worth his while to fix his Reſidence among us, and that we have ſhewn a due Senſibility to manly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody, where the Sound is expreſſive of the Senſe, and where no unnatural Diviſions, nor idle inſignificant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0311400902:96"/>Quirks miſlead the Ear in a thrilling Maze of wild and and random Notes. It is owing to the Encouragement we have afforded this Gentleman, that we can now boaſt the nobleſt and moſt rational Muſic in the World. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuch a Genius as Doctor <hi>Boyce</hi> will be always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to vindicate us from <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s national Oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium, and the Admirers of <hi>Arne</hi> have conſtantly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated him for his peculiar Talent, at finding the moſt emphatic Expreſſion in a Compoſition, and diſcovering where the Paſſions are placed in every Piece of Poetry. To theſe Paſſages he never fails to give their full Energy, and like a raviſhing Commentator he brings new Beauties into Light with ſuch a Sweetneſs of Harmony, that every Breaſt yields irreſiſtibly to the melting Impreſſion. I am proud to have an Opportunity of ſaying that we are likely to have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Opera ſet to Muſic by the laſt mentioned Gentleman, which, I perſuade myſelf, will do Honour to him and his Country.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the Time, when the above Eſſay was wrote, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> a Pupil of Mr. <hi>Handell</hi>'s, has diſplayed a noble Genius for muſical Compoſition, and the Succeſs, which his Opera, called the <hi>Fairies,</hi> met with on <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Stage, at once gives luſtre to his Merit, and is a Proof of the public Taſte.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>With Regard to Dramatic Poetry, our Advantage over every Nation in the known World is, I think, very apparent. The beſt Critics have laid it down as a Rule that a Performance is to be judged by its Number of ſtriking Beauties, and not by ſome Inaccuracies, and the Inſtances of occaſional Conformity to the vicious Taſte of the Times. If <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> is viewed in this light he will certainly appear to any unprejudiced Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der infinitely ſuperior to <hi>Corneille, Racine,</hi> and all the poliſhed Writers of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> I remember a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s Writings, where he is at infinite Pains to bring together a String of Quotations from the beſt <hi>French</hi> Tragedies to evince their great Talents for the ſublime; in all he makes up about twenty or thirty at
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0311400902:97"/>moſt; and the Beauties of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> have of late been publiſhed in ſeveral Volumes. Beſides, <hi>Otway</hi> has found Acceſs to the Heart better than any <hi>French Writer</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and the domeſtic Paſſions are touched by him with the greateſt Elegance and Simplicity. It is very common on the <hi>French</hi> Stage to hear a Perſonage of the Drama, exclaiming perpetually <hi>Helas,</hi> and <hi>mon Dicu!</hi> and then formally acquainting the Audience that he feels ſuch and ſuch Senſations; but our great Maſters of the Paſſions make their Hearers feel by Sympathy the Agitations of their Hero's Breaſt, without running into cold languid Declamation.</p>
                  <p>The Dramatic Poetry of this Country is like our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, built upon the bold Eaſis of Liberty; and though the latter has brought our King to the Block, and the former admits Blood to be ſhed on the Stage; theſe are Corruptions which have intruded, and are, as the Poets ſays,
<q>
                        <hi>Effects unhappy from a noble Cauſe.</hi>
                     </q> Upon the whole, we may apply, what <hi>Horace</hi> has ſaid to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>—Spirat Tragicum ſatis, &amp; feliciter audet</hi>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Poets are ſufficiently poſſeſſed of the Spirit of Tragedy, but they are not attentive to the minute Rules of correct Taſte, and the Trouble of blotting. It may be added, that they have more real Fire, ſublimer Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and Characters better marked than any Nation whatever; and with regard to Painting and Muſic, we can boaſt ſo many Maſters in both as might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the <hi>French</hi> Author from charging us with a Want of Genius, and Taſte for the fine Arts.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſmiſs this Paper, without obſerving, that it is a very particular Pleaſure to me, to find the Subject, on which I have been hitherto offering ſome ſcattered Reflections, touched upon with great Spirit by a Writer of acknowledged Genius.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Gathric.</hi>
                     </note> In a Preface to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0311400902:98"/>a Novel called the FRIENDS, he has expreſſed himſelf with great Warmth, and a noble national Jealouſy. After mentioning that <hi>Voltaire</hi> calls his Countrymen, THE ABSOLUTE LEGISLATORS OF ALL THE FINE ARTS IN EUROPE, "how ſhameleſs," ſays he, <q>is this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Face of a Country, that gave Bread to <hi>Holben,</hi> Dignities to <hi>Reubens,</hi> and Encouragement to <hi>Vandike;</hi> and that for Years before (even by this Writer's own Acknowledgment) the national Taſte of <hi>France</hi> was formed! While that Taſte was barbarous, <hi>Johnſon</hi> enriched his native Tongue with Comedies, wrought up to more than <hi>Terentian</hi> Regularity and Propriety, in point of Conduct; and while <hi>France</hi> was ignorant of almoſt every Order of Architecture, <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> was rearing Houſes, and projecting Palaces which all the boaſted Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>France,</hi> in that Art, have not yet equalled. I ſhall forbear to urge the Examples of <hi>Spencer</hi> or <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> becauſe I am firmly and ſeriouſly of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that no <hi>Frenchman</hi> ever yet was able (ſuppoſing him to underſtand <hi>Engliſh</hi> equally as <hi>French</hi>) to taſte the Beauties of either of theſe Poets. For the Truth of this, I appeal to every <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Senſe, who has had the Misfortune to read the unwilling, ſcanty, ſtarved and miſtaken Encomiums, that <hi>Voltaire</hi> has beſtowed on <hi>Shakeſpear.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Is it not rather too charitable in the Author of the foregoing Paſſage to ſuppoſe Monſieur <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s reſerved Praiſes of <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> could ariſe only from an Inability of reliſhing his Beauties? For my Part, I muſt avow it, the <hi>French</hi> Writer appears to me capable of feeling every Stroke of our great Poet, but Envy, and a vain Ambition of erecting himſelf into an imagined Superiority, have rendered him open and explicit in his Abuſes, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating and frigid in his Commendations. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; what <hi>Virgil</hi> has given away from his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we claim for ours. None better ſhall inform the

                  <p>THE Tragedy of <hi>Richard the Third</hi> was performed here lately, and as there were many Circumſtances in the Battle, which was fought in the fifth Act, quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Audience, it may not be improper to give ſome Account of that Engagement. The Theatrical Cock had done Salutation to the Morn, and <hi>Richard</hi> had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the Soldiery, when the Attack was begun on the Left-Wing, under the Command of the Lord High <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Grey.</hi> This Impreſſion was received by General <hi>Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> who ordered the Woods to be ſcowered, but the Enemy ſetting up the War-hoop, he was repulſed into the Green-Room, where he rallied his Spirits and his Forces, and again returned to the Charge. Upon this the Fight was renewed with great Alacrity, and continued very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, until a general Deſolation ſtretched the greateſt Part of the Combatants upon the Scene of Action.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> LATELY met with a Fable, in a <hi>French</hi> Writer, which I thought, carried with it a great Deal of Propriety, and, though it was rather eked out, as is ſometimes the Caſe among the livelieſt Geniuſſes of that Country, beyond the juſt Limits preſcribed by the Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, it was however conducted with ſuch a Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of Fancy and Expreſſion, that I was very much entertained with the Peruſal of it. Poetry, (ſays my Author) is the Son of the God of <hi>Eaſe</hi> and the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of <hi>Meditation.</hi> He bears in his Appearance ſuch a ſtrong Reſemblance to theſe his Parents, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to miſtake the Marks of his Legitimacy, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0311400902:101"/>therefore, whenever theſe Proofs of his Birth are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, we may with Reaſon conclude him to be of a ſpurious Breed.</p>
                  <p>From his Father, he derives his apparent Indolence, his Serenity, his graceful Elocution, and his unlaboured Turn of Thought, together with his elegant Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in all his Compoſitions; a remarkable Neglect of the ordinary Uſes of Life, a Diſregard for Riches, and a total Abſence of all worldly Ambition, ſave what is inſpired by Virtue and honeſt Fame, are his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Characteriſtics. From his Mother, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes his Modeſty, which makes him not very fond of obtruding himſelf into Company; his penſive Air, which inclines him to be always enforcing ſome Precept of Morality, or ſome Topic which may be ſubſervient to the Uſe or Enjoyment of Life; his Love of Solitude, which induces him to ſhun Crowds and great Cities, and leads him into rural Scenes, where he may give free Scope to his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation undiſturbed by the Cares and Anxieties of Life. The ſame Diſpoſition in his Temper renders him not very fond of being known by the Bulk of Mankind, that he may prevent the Inconveniencies attendant on him when his Affairs require that he ſhould make his Appearance in Public. If he puts any thing abroad into the World, and thinks proper to publiſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his contemplative Moments, he does not like to be pointed at by the Multitude, but chuſes to receive the Tribute of Applauſe, obtained by his Writings, without being liable to the Sarcaſms, the Taunts, and malevolent Jeſts, which are always the ſure Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Praiſe, and which are generally a very great Diſcount upon his Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Motives he is enamoured with Retirement, and he is further confirmed in his ſequeſtred State by a Conſideration, that the more he keeps himſelf at a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0311400902:102"/>Diſtance from the Reſt of Mankind, the more Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are willing to deſcry in his Productions; in like Manner as the Hills, and the remote Parts of a Proſpect preſent a more vivid Green, than when our Advances to them have brought the Scene more cloſe to our Inſpection, and the Heath, the craggy Rock, and ploughed Land, are familiariſed to the naked Eye.</p>
                  <p>This is the Subſtance of the Fable; the Meaning that it inculcates is certainly very juſt and obvious. The beſt Writers in all Ages have ſubſcribed to it, and the moſt applauded of the antient Poets are conſtantly offering warm Pictures of rural Imagery to our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; they ſeem to be ſtifled with Duſt and Smoke, when they mention a City-Life, and we frequently ſind them expatiating with Rapture upon the Pleaſures of a Country-Life, which they look upon to be the Nurſe of Thought, and the only Sphere in which their Studies can be proſecuted with any Degree of Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Obſervation will hold good with Regard to all Kinds of Writing, unleſs it be thoſe excellent Productions of the Preſs which make their Appearance under the various Shapes of <hi>Newgate</hi>-Memoirs, New's-Papers, and political Pamphlets. In Works that call for a long Train of Reaſoning, ſubtile Diſquiſitions, and unwearied Application, undoubtedly the proper Place to accompliſh them, is in thoſe Regions, where Riot and Debauchery are Strangers; where Gaming, Drinking, and idle Amuſements of all Sorts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and where, above all, Health and Cheerfulneſs add new Luſtre to the Face of Things.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps ſeem a Paradox, if I ſhould aſſert, that, among all the Gentlemen of the Quill, there is not one, to whom Solitude and Eaſe are more neceſſary than the periodical Writer; but though his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are generally comprized in a narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and though he does not, for the moſt Part,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0311400902:103"/>pretend to ſearch every Subject to the Bottom; though it is not expected of him to lay before the Reader deep, philoſophical Speculations, abſtracted Reaſonings, and new Syſtems of Morality and Religion; yet, in my Apprehenſion, it will be found, upon an attentive Survey of his Situation, that it is particularly incumbent on the Adventurer in this Way, to withdraw himſelf from the Buſtle of Mankind, and to appear, as ſeldom as poſſible in little Circles at Coffee-houſes, convivial Clubs at Taverns, and the long Train of public Places, which ſerve no other Purpoſe in this Metropolis than merely to kill Time, as the Phraſe is, and to hurry a Perſon into a Courſe of Vanity and Diſſipation.</p>
                  <p>There is a Paſſage in Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> which I have ever peruſed with Admiration, becauſe it ſhews him to have been a Man of the moſt prudent Underſtanding, as well as the moſt finiſhed Poet; Two Adjuncts which are ſeldom found to coexiſt.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps too great a Tincture of Pride runs through theſe Lines, for any one elſe to make Application of them to himſelf. <hi>Pope</hi> had Talents ſuperior to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Mankind, but if a more humble Writer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withdraw himſelf from our preſent Town-Smarts and Critics, like an Eaſtern Monarch, he may at leaſt accompliſh it, like <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Friend in his third Satire,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0311400902:104"/>who retired from <hi>Rome,</hi> to avoid its Plagues and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</p>

                  <p>It is poſſible, my Readers may think theſe Tenets inconſiſtent with the Character of <hi>Ranger;</hi> but airy and gay as <hi>Ranger</hi> may appear, he is now perfectly averſe to the wild Sallies of his Nameſake in the Play: He would not chuſe to ſtagger home from a Box and Dice in the Morning, nor to get through a Window into an honeſt Gentleman's Houſe at Night; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run after every white Apron he ſees, nor keep Company with a Set of Fellows whom he deſpiſes. And yet there are Diſſipations to which a Reſident in Town is for ever liable; add to theſe, the Danger attendant on a Writer's making himſelf known in too many Quarters of the Town. Prejudices are ever apt to ariſe againſt an Author, who does not take care to conceal himſelf. The Tranſition is ſo quick from the Performance to the Perſon who produced it, that from the Moment a Man begins to publiſh, he is enliſted into a State of Warfare with almoſt all the Critics and <hi>Malevoli</hi> of the Age.</p>
                  <p>Some Readers have no Criterion, by which to judge of a Production, except the Rules of Phyſiognomy; and if an Author appears younger than themſelves, they hold it abſolutely impoſſible to receive any Inſtruction from him. It is, by the Way, ſomewhat ſtrange that this experienced Claſs will not allow a Man to be ſit to entertain them, until his Imagination begins to flag, his Invention to cloſe, like Flowers at the Setting of the Sun, his Memory to decay, and his Wit, if he have any Share of it, to become ſlow and tardy. This however, is what is deſired by the Man who would look an Author in the Teeth to know his Age, and from thence make an Eſtimate of his Merit.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Qui redit ad faſtos, &amp; virtutem eſtimat annis.</hi>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0311400902:105"/>There is another Set of People who make it their Buſineſs to pry into a Writer's Connections, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly inform themſelves of his Attachments, his Friendſhips, and his Reſentments. According as theſe coincide with their own Way of Thinking, they blame or approve; even though the Author is abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial in his Animadverſions. <q>There, ſays one, <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> is right—<hi>O, D—n</hi> the Fellow! was ever ſuch a Poſition as this?—my dear <hi>Ranger,</hi> that won't paſs upon us—We know you are ptejudiced in this Affair —and there again; — You praiſe this Man becauſe you are intimate with him. — Did I not ſee you walk Arm in Arm with him, the other Night, at the Coffee-houſe?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Manner is the Perſon judged, who attempts to run the dangerous Career of Wit, as <hi>Boileau</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>du bel Eſprit la Carriere epineuſe;</hi> and upon the whole, I think it may be laid down as a Maxim, that no periodical Writer ſhould ever reſide in this Metropolis, that he may effectually evade the Cenſures of Prejudice, the Blaſts of Detraction, the Envy of rival Wit, and the ſeveral Avocations of a Town-Life. It may be added, that it is abſolutely neceſſary, that an Author ſhould never ſuffer himſelf to be known, on Account of the Antipathy which will ariſe to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Patroclus</hi> conquered for a long Time in the Armour of <hi>Achilles;</hi> but had he let the Secret eſcape abroad, with double his Strength and Valour, he would not have been able to atchieve any Thing remarkable againſt the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who would have inſtantly conceived an utter Contempt of the Man, whom they dreaded in a feigned Appearance.</p>

                  <p>THE repeated Advices from <hi>France</hi> of the noble Struggle made by the Parliament againſt the arbitrary Meaſures of the Clergy, occaſion inexpreſſible Joy in this little Aſylum of the Refugees. Yeſterday, indeed, an unlucky Diſpute aroſe between Monſieur <hi>d'Onion</hi> and Monſieur <hi>d'Echalotte,</hi> which had like to have been attended with bad Conſequences. The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it was as follows: Monſieur <hi>d'Onion,</hi> after peruſing the <hi>Paris à la Main,</hi> for about five and thirty Minutes, broke out into an Exclamation.—<q>Parblieu! (ſays he) de ting go ver vel in <hi>France,</hi> de Parliment make noble Effort, et ma fois, it is not impoſſeeble, dat de Huginots may be reſtore — Ventrebleu! if I zee dat Day, I die vid Pleazure, for I have ſacrifize my Eſtate of many honderd Livre de Rente for my Relizion — Ventreblue! it is true.</q> Monſieur <hi>d'Echalotte,</hi> looking upon this Boaſt to be a Reflection upon the other Gentlemen of the Religion, took him up ſhort. <q>Monſier <hi>d'Onion,</hi> (anſwered he) fat Right have you to make the Man of Conſequence more dan oder Peeple?—Dere are doſe that have de Zele as eclatante as Monſieur <hi>d'Onion:</hi>—my Fader too gave up his Eſtate of five honderd Livres a Year, avec Droit de Chaſſe too, becauſe he would not be Papiſte, and myſelf, Monſieur <hi>d'Onion,</hi> I myſelf, if I had a touſand Livres de Rente, I vood abandone it, rader dan ſubmit to de Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Corblieu! damn it.</q> To this replied Monſieur <hi>d'Onion,</hi> 
                     <q>I would have you know, Monſieur, dat my Eſtate was full as good as yours, if not better.</q> 
                     <q>Parblieu, (ſays Monſieur <hi>d'Echalotte)</hi> dat may be, Monſieur <hi>d'Onion,</hi> but not avec de Droit de Chaſſe.</q> 
                     <q>Sir, (ſays the other) it

This Matter growing ſerious, Monſieur <hi>Charenton,</hi> who is of a very friendly Diſpoſition, thought proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe. <q>Meſſieurs (ſays he) pourquoi querellez vous? Why you quarrel? You have bote ſuffer ver much in the Perſecution, and I too, aldo I never talk of it, loſe my <hi>Charge</hi> of two honderd Livres a Year, but I do not make Merit of dat—no, no, cela me'chappe jamais—for all dat every Body know it.—Derefore, Meſſieurs, as we are perſecute all ſor de zame Cauſe, let us be good Vriends, je vous en prie.</q> This pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic Speech had ſo good an Effect upon the two Gentlemen above-mentioned, that they immediately embraced each other, and ſpent the Remainder of the Evening, in a very affectionate Manner, at a Game of Cheſs.</p>

You will perceive by the Contents, that it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt Grounds, I undertook, in a former Letter, to juſtify the Principles of my illuſtrious Countryman. My Vindication of him might poſſibly be ſuſpected to have its Source in Friendſhip; and therefore loſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of its Strength. But here, Sir, he pleads his own Defence; his Letter will demonſtrate to you his Zeal for Religion, and it is to be hoped, will ſilence his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers. You will find it accompanied by a Defence of his Syſtem, written by Mr. <hi>Warburton,</hi> a celebrated Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> by diſtributing this Performance amongſt his Friends, adopts the Doctrine, approves the Sentiments, and thereby gives to the whole an additional Value.</p>
                        <p>The Opinion, which you conceived of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> is on your Side very excuſable. You received the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from the Miſrepreſentations of his Enemies, for many Enemies he has. <hi>Urit enim fulgero ſuo,</hi> &amp;c. His ſuperior Talents have excited a great deal of Envy towards his Perſon, and his Connections with ſeveral eminent Perſonages, all engaged in oppoſite Intereſts, or attached to the Court, have further ſerved to inflame the Minds of Men againſt him. But there are many evincing Proofs of his Probity, and the Incorruptibility of his Principles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0311400902:110"/>I have been informed, that he was in Intimacy with ſeveral ſucceſſive Miniſters, and often with many at the ſame Time. Thus circumſtanced, it would have been eaſy for him to create a large Fortune, had he availed himſelf of the Diſgrace of one Party, in order to recommend himſelf to the other. But he poſſeſſed a Soul ſuperior to ſuch mean Artifices.</p>
                        <p>My Intelligence adds further, that the Queen, who was an Admirer of his Genius, expreſſed an Inclination to employ him, without requiring any Thing further of him than a diſſembled Conformity to the eſtabliſhed Religion of his Country, promiſing, at the ſame Time, to diſpenſe with the Strictneſs of the Oath uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered upon ſuch Occaſions But Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible to Temptation, which may ſerve to prove he was directed by other Principles than thoſe of a Sceptic or a Deiſt.</p>
                        <p>I muſt aſſure you, Sir, that I am not induced to this Taſk by ſupererogatory Friendſhip to Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> nor am I willing to offer him the Incenſe of Adulation. I mean ſolely to ſerve the Cauſe of Truth and Juſtice, and am,</p>

                        <p>THE Expectation, in which I have been for ſome Time paſt, of receiving the Preſent you have honoured me with, was the Occaſion of my delaying ſo long to anſwer your Letter. I am at length favoured with your Poem on Religion, and ſhould have received, from the Peruſal of it, a Pleaſure unmixed with Pain, had I not the Mortification to find, that you impute ſeveral Principles to me which I abhor and deteſt. My Uneafineſs met ſome Alleviation, from a Paſſage in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0311400902:111"/>your Preface, where you declare your Inability, from a Want of Knowledge of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, to give your own Judgment on the <hi>Eſſay on Man;</hi> you add, that you do not controvert my Tenets, but the evil Conſequences deducible from them, and the Drift of ſome Paſſages in my Poem, which Perſons of notable Sagacity imagine they have diſcovered. This Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a ſhining Proof of your Candor, your Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and your Charity. I muſt take Leave to aſſure you, Sir, that your Unacquaintance with the Original has not proved more fatal to me, than the imperfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of my Tranſlators, who have not ſufficiently informed themſelves of my real Sentiments. Though the many additional Embelliſhments, which my Piece has received from the elegant Verſion of <hi>M. D. R</hi>—, have done an Honour to the <hi>Eſſay on Man;</hi> yet it has, on the other Hand, ſuffered a greater Injury from his frequent Miſ-apprehenſion of the Principles it incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. Theſe Miſtakes you will perceive are totally refuted in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Piece, which I have tranſmitted to you. It is a critical and philoſophic Commentary written by the learned Author of the <hi>divine Legation of Moſes.</hi> I flatter myſelf that the Chevalier <hi>Ramſay</hi> will, from his Zeal for Truth, take the Trouble to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Contents of it. I ſhall then perſwade myſelf that your Suſpicions will be effaced, and I ſhall have no Appeal from your Candor and Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>In the mean Time I ſhall not heſitate to declare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very cordially in Regard to ſome Particulars, about which you have deſired an Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>I muſt avow then openly and ſincerely, that my Principles are diametrically oppoſite to the Sentiments of <hi>Spinoza</hi> and <hi>Leibuitz;</hi> they are perfectly coincident with the Tenets of <hi>M. Paſchal,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and I ſhall always eſteem it an Honour to me, to imitate the Moderation, with which the latter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his private Opinions to the Deciſions of the

                        <p>THE Mildneſs and Humility, with which you juſtify yourſelf, is a convincing Proof of your Religion; the more ſo, as you have done it to one, on whom it is incumbent to make his own Apology for his raſh Attack upon your Character. Your Manner of pardoning me is the more delicate, as it is done without any Mixture of Reproach; but though you acquit me with ſo much Politeneſs, I ſhall not ſo eaſily forgive myſelf.</p>
                        <p>Certain it is, a Precipitance of Zeal hurried me away. As I had often heard Poſitions ſaid to be yours, or at leaſt Conſequences reſulting from your Eſſay, cited againſt certain Truths (which I now find you reſpect as much as myſelf) I thought, I had a Right to enter the Liſts with you. The Paſſage, in my Preface, was extorted from me by a Degree of Remorſe, which I felt in writing againſt you. This Remorſe, Sir, was awakened in me by the Conſideration, that the greateſt Men are always the moſt ſuſceptible of the Truths of Revelation. I was really grieved to think that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould oppoſe a Religion, whoſe Enemies have ever been contemptible, and it appeared ſtrange, that in a Work which points out the Road to Happineſs, you ſhould furniſh Arms to thoſe, who are induſtrious to miſguide us in the Reſearch.</p>
                        <p>Your Letter, at the ſame Time that it does Honour to your Character, muſt bring a Bluſh in my Face, for having entertained unjuſt Suſpicions; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, I think myſelf obliged to make it public; the Injury which I have done you, was ſo, the Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0311400902:113"/>ſhould be the ſame. I owe this to you; I owe it to myſelf; I owe it to Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>Whatever may be urged in your Favour in the Commentary you have ſent me, it is now rendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary by your own Declaration. The Reſpect, which you avow for Religion, is a ſufficient Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Doctrine; I will add, that for the Future, thoſe among us, who ſhall feel the laudable Ambition of making their Poetry ſubſervient to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ought to take you for their Model, and it ſhould ever be remembred, that the greateſt Poet, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is one of the humbleſt Sons of the Church.

                        <p>THAT we have had a Share, by our joint En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, in obtaining a Repeal of the <hi>Jew-Bill,</hi> affords me muckle Content, but notwithſtanding this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there is ſtill another Matter that has purturbed my Spirits for ſome Time paſt. I believe, I need nottell one of Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi>'s quick Penetration, that I mean the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Act,</hi> which, I make no Doubt, was deſigned for very good and laudable Purpoſes, but will moſt certainly, in its Conſequences, prove of the utmoſt Detriment to this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0311400902:116"/>Nation, and be the final Ruin of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility. I already ſee them dwindling by Degrees into an emaciated, puny, ſickly Race; and let me tell you, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> it cannot be otherwiſe, if, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are only to marry among one another, without any poſſible Means of improving the Breed by a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of wholeſome Fleſh and Blood. To what a wretched State <hi>England</hi> may be reduced, I have lately had an Opportunity of obſerving in ſome Scenes that were really very affecting. As I was ſojourning upon the Height of a <hi>Caledonian</hi> Mountain, the Air was ſuddenly rarified to a greater Degree of Purity than uſual, and ſuch Openings of Futurity were diſcloſed to me, that I am even now ſhocked at the Reflection. As I was formerly taught the Rudiments of Humanity, and inſtructed to indite a Letter, by my Friend Mr. <hi>M'Gregor,</hi> a worthy <hi>Philomath</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> I reſolved to loſe no Time, but to ſend the Particulars of my Viſion to my Friend <hi>Ranger;</hi> and this too I have done, as I did upon the former Occaſion, in the Form of a New's-Paper, which I am ſure will be the Stile of the Times.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0311400902:117"/>Year, complaining, that his Guardians have hindered him from performing a Contract of Marriage with Miſs <hi>Maria Healthy,</hi> a beautiful young Lady of a moderate Fortune. The Council for the Guardians replied, that they have concluded a much more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Match for him, with Miſs <hi>Ricketty Barren,</hi> an Heireſs, upon which this Cauſe, now depending al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two Years, was finally determined againſt the Complainant; this being the ſummary Way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in Caſes of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>By the laſt Mail from <hi>Ireland,</hi> we have Advice, that as ſoon as his Grace the Duke of <hi>Slender-Shanks,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, landed on <hi>George</hi>'s Key, the Croud, that was gathered on the Occaſion, all burſt into a loud Fit of Laughter, crying out, <hi>"Arrah, but "is that he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We can aſſure our Readers, that the Managers of both Play-houſes have reſolved to fit up the Boxes with Stoves, to prevent the Complaint of their being too cold for People of Quality, who have ſuffered great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies for Want of this Accommodation of late Years.</p>
                  <p>Laſt <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night, as the Lords <hi>Scrophulous</hi> and <hi>Spindle</hi> were returning home from the <hi>Burletta</hi> in a <hi>Vis-a-vis</hi> Sedan-Chair, the Chair-men, walking in a violent Hurry, gave ſuch a violent Motion to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that the two young Lords were both thrown out of their Seats, and both their Heads were unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knocked together. Very happily their Lordſhips received no great Hurt, and their Nerves being now leſs convulſed after their Fright, they are in a fair Way of Recovery.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, an excellent Sermon was preached at the Chapel Royal, by Dr. <hi>Rubric,</hi> Chaplain in ordinary, upon which Occaſion the Sword of State was carried by the Earl of <hi>Jeſſamy,</hi> and Lord <hi>George Frible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About Eleven o'Clock laſt Night, the Counteſs of <hi>Hyſterick</hi> was delivered of a dead Child, to the great
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0311400902:118"/>Diſappointment of Lord <hi>Hyſterick,</hi> and all his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>This Morning early, the Lady of the Right honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lord Viſcount <hi>Shadow</hi> was delivered, at her Houſe in <hi>Palace-Yard, Weſtminſter,</hi> of Twins, to the great Amazement of his Lordſhip and all the Family, as her Ladyſhip ſhewed no viſible Tokens of Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, her Shape being to the laſt remarkably delicate and fine. Whether Providence has ſent Boys or Girls as yet no Conjecture can be made.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday at Noon died of the Gout in his Stomach, and a Complication of other Diſorders, his Grace the Duke of <hi>High-blood,</hi> aged nine Months. By this unlucky Event that noble Family is extinct.</p>
                  <p>We hear that ſeveral Petitions for Divorces, with Leave to marry again, have been lately preſented to the Lords; — <hi>All at the Suit of the Ladies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſt Week, above fifty Ladies of Quality were found in Bed with their Coach-men, their Butlers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> laſt was reviewed upon <hi>Putney-Common</hi> the Firſt Regiment of Guards, by the Honourable Sir <hi>Robert Lungs,</hi> who, was handſomely mounted upon an eaſy Pad, ſent to him as a Preſent from the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was in great Spirits, and wore a white Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief about his Neck.</p>
                  <p>A Suit is commenced in the <hi>Commons,</hi> by a Perſon of Faſhion, againſt a Gentleman of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for criminal Converſation with his Wife, and we hear that a Law will ſhortly be enacted, to prohibit the Importation of <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> into this Kingdom for the Future.</p>
                  <p>A Duel was fought Yeſterday in <hi>Mary le Bon</hi> Fields, brtween Sir <hi>Dilberry Diddle</hi> and Lord <hi>Trip,</hi> in which the latter had his Cheek ſo violently ſcratched, that it is now feared he cannot recover.</p>
                  <p>By Letters from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> we are informed, that Lord <hi>John Fiddle-faddle,</hi> hoiſted his Flag there on <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0311400902:119"/>laſt, but an hard Gale coming on, his Lordſhip was unfortunately blown over board.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Advices add, that the Banns were publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice in the proper Pariſh-Church between Capt. <hi>Hardy</hi> and Miſs <hi>Wholeſome,</hi> but ſailing Orders hurrying the Captain away on a Voyage round the World, the Nuptials remain unfiniſhed.</p>

                  <p>THE Company were entertained, Yeſterday Evening, by a Diſpute between the Doctors OPIUM and SNAKEROOT, upon the Queſtion whether Preaching or Playing is of the greateſt Service to a Chriſtian Community. Doctor SNAKEROOT thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to declare that though he had not ſeen the Inſide of a Church any Time theſe fifteen Years paſt, yet, unleſs the Method of exhibiting was different from what it uſed to be, when he was taken to thoſe Places by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, he could not poſſibly conceive what could be the Advantage of frequenting them. Doctor OPIUM, not a little picqued at this Declaration, thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on his Part to mention that he knew as little of what paſſed within the Walls of the Church as the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0311400902:120"/>other; but out of Reſpect to many reverend Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, who were his extreme good Patients, he could not help thinking, that thoſe Aſſemblies, under proper Management, might be rendered a tolerable inſtructive Amuſement. <q>I grant you, (replied <hi>Snakeroot)</hi> if the Managers would pay ſome little Deference to the public Taſte; and in theſe Caſes it ought to be conſulted, for it appears to me that Preaching and Playing had originally a pretty cloſe Affinity. Indeed I know nothing that can give a better Idea of the Simplicity of the antient Drama, which, without any Diſtinction of Scenes was divided into <hi>three Acts,</hi> reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one Perſon, and each of them cloſed by a <hi>Chorus;</hi> and they were generally preſented upon ſome Feſtival, inſtituted in Honour of the Deities; and as a further Proof, you know, Sir, (continued he) that in their Churches they ſtill retain the Word. <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which the <hi>Greek</hi> Writers made uſe of to ſignify a Stage.</q> Doctor OPIUM was going to reply when his Diſcourſe was interrupted by the Appearance of Mr. HARTSHORN, the Apothecary, who haſtily came up and for about five Minutes buried his Noſe in the Periwig of the ſaid Doctor. A Conſultation was then held by the ſaid Doctor OPIUM, the ſaid Mr. HARTSHORN, and the ſaid Doctor OPIUM'S Cane; when they all three withdrew together, and left Doctor SNAKEROOT in quiet Poſſeſſion of the Argument.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Chambers over my Apartment in <hi>Gray's-Inn</hi> having been unoccupied for a conſiderable Time paſt, I was enabled to purſue my Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations with the greater Eaſe and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, being free from thoſe ſudden Alarms of Noiſe, which are otherwiſe inevitable in any of the Inns of Court. But my Repoſe has met with an Interruption of ſo pleaſant a Kind, that I have determined to acquaint my Readers with all the Particulars of the Incident.</p>
                  <p>About ten Days ſince, a Gentleman entered upon the Premiſes, and ever ſince I have been frequently diſturbed, when at my Studies, by ſuch quick and unexpected Shocks, that it was abſolutely impoſſible for me to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſame Train of Thought with any Degree of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. As I was Yeſterday-Morning peruſing Mr. <hi>Hawkins Brown</hi>'s excellent Poem upon the Immortality of the Soul, in which he has artfully combined in their full Force all the Arguments in Support of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Article of our Belief, ſuddenly I heard a violent Bounce over my Head; the Cieling ſhook as if ready to come down, and a Convulſion ſhook the whole Houſe. Deep Contemplation ſometimes unbraces the Nerves to ſuch a Degree, that an unexpected Noiſe ſtartles the whole Frame of the Body, and throws the Spirits out of that placid State, which is requiſite in order to think with Calmneſs and Perſpicuity. This Diſcompoſure I experienced upon ſo many Occaſions, and ſometimes in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0311400902:122"/>ſuch quick Succeſſion, that I judged it proper to ſtep up Stairs to the Gentleman, to inform him of the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, which I lay under, and to beg of him to manage his Affairs for the future with leſs Turbulence.</p>
                  <p>I knocked two or three Times at his Door, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no Anſwer, and hearing him run about with great Violence of Exertion, I made bold to walk in unbid. You go into the Dining-Room through a Glaſs-Folding-Door, which was at this Time ſhut, but the Curtains undrawn. Through the Window, I ſaw the Gentleman pulling off his Cloaths with the utmoſt Vehemence, and in an Inſtant he appeared in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and Air, of an old Woman delivering Doctor <hi>Rock</hi>'s Bills upon <hi>Ludgate-Hill.</hi> Surprized at this Change, I ſtopt ſhort to obſerve the Actions of this extraordinary Perſonage, and very ſhortly I was entertained with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Viciſſitude of Appearance; for, quick as Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſhifted Cloaths, and walked about the Room with a Baſket, and with an audible Voice pronounced, <q>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins for Coffee and Tea, Gentlemen and Ladies.</q> This appeared extremely whimſical; he then varied his Dreſs, and with a Silver Pipe cried out <hi>London-Evening Poſt:</hi> After which he threw away his Bundle of Papers, fall down upon his Knees, laid his Hand on his Heart, looked up with a great Expreſſion of Joy, and then riſing, indulged himſelf in all the whimſical Vagaries of a Man frantic with Senſations too exquiſite to endure. In this Way he continued for ſome Time, and at length threw himſelf into an Attitude of Surprize; after which, he ran wild about the Room, like one almoſt diſtracted with Deſpair, looking up in vain to Heaven for Relief, when to my great Amazement, he unexpectedly muſtered up his Spirits, and with great Alacrity leaped through a ſmall Aperture into the Coal-Hole. After abſconding there for a ſhort Space of Time, he came forth with a Sack of Coals upon his Shoulders, which he emptied in the Middle of the Room, calling with ſome Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0311400902:123"/>
                     <hi>"Below."</hi> He had no ſooner done this, but he directed his Eyes ſparkling with Joy to ſome imaginary Object with which his Fancy ſeemed to be highly pleaſed; He then came forward, and knocked at the Door, where I had taken my Station, which I then took an Opportunity to open, and as I was advancing towards him, he ſeized me by the Shoulder, and twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me round with all his Strength ſent me reeling into a Corner of his Room. Upon this, he walked into the outward Apartment, ſlapping the Door after him, and immediately opened a ſmall Caſement Window, which was over the Door of his Bed-Chamber. From thence he ſtretched out his Neck, and looking me full in the Face, burſt out into a loud Fit of Laughter; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a Squirt, he began to let fly at me in ſuch a Manner, that I was ſoon pretty well watered from Head to Foot. The Exclamations, which I vented upon this Occaſion, rung ſuch a Peal in the Gentleman's Ears, that he was brought to a Recollection of himſelf. He came down very leiſurely from his Poſt, and with a modeſt Air and genteel Addreſs he politely aſked my Pardon, and told me that he was ſo intent upon his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he really did not perceive that he was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Indignities to a Stranger.—</p>
                  <p>Imagining that I was in the Hands of a Madman, I was willing to acquieſce with his Apology, but to ſatisfy my Curioſity, I took the Liberty to enquire of him, the Nature of his Buſineſs and what might be his Vocation. <q>Sir, ſaid the Gentleman, won't you pleaſe to be ſeated, With regard to my Buſineſs, Sir, I am a Pantomime Poet—a Pantomime Poet!</q>—<q>Pray, Sir, what is a Pantomime Poet?</q>—To this Queſtion my Friend anſwered with a Smile, <q>a Writer of Pantomime, Sir. —It is a Plan which I have determined to apply my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to, having Reaſon to think that it is the only Way of ſucceeding in the preſent Age. I was bred at <hi>Eton</hi> School, from whence at a proper Time I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0311400902:124"/>to the Univerſity; at both which Places I laid in a ſufficient Store of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and always feeling a particular Turn for the Drama I applied my Genius principally to Tragedy and Comedy. In each Species of Writing I have given the finiſhing Hand to ſome Pieces which have received the Approbation of a few Gentlemen of known Taſte and perfectly verſed in critical Matters. Encouraged by their Opinion I came to Town, and after a long tedious Application I find it impoſſible to get any of my Performances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> has already, like a provident General, laid his Plan of Operations, and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> is determined to bring on no new Pieces, until we have ſuch a Genius as <hi>Tom Durfey</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>I wiſh Mr.—, ſays he, we had ſuch another Writer now.</hi> 
                     <q>On this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have taken a Reſolution to cultivate a Species of the Drama, which cannot fail of being profitable to all Parties, and, being agreeable to the public Taſte, will be brought on without Difficulty as ſoon as offered.</q>—</p>
                  <p>Here I broke in upon the Thread of his Diſcourſe, by aſking if he was determined to become Harlequin himſelf? To this he anſwered me in the Negative; but as it is a Rule in Writing to place yourſelf in the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Character for which you are to find ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dialogue, he had judged it not improper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to this Precept, and therefore, in order the better to concert the ſudden Eſcapes and Changes of Dreſs, which have ſo pleaſing an effect in this kind of Poetry, he was practiſing over every ſtriking Attitude, and every unexpected Situation of the Harlequin, that he might be the better able to form an Opinion of the Plot and the ſeveral Incidents of the Marvellous, which he had found it neceſſary to introduce. He proceeded to inform me, that he purpoſed calling his firſt Piece HARLEQUIN TRIUMPHANT, or POETRY IN THE SUDS. In this Performance the whole Race of Authors are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0311400902:125"/>to the Deriſion of the Public, and Harlequin is to crack a very great Number of facetious Jokes upon their shoulders with his wooden Sword. A Poet is to be placed at a Table with a Beef-ſtake laid before him, to his inexpreſſible Joy, when in an Inſtant, by ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Stroke of Art, the ſolid Subſtance is to be changed into a modern Tragedy, and <hi>Calvert</hi>'s <hi>Entire Butt</hi> wafted away from his longing Eyes. The Bard after this is to be ducked in a Well, and then toſſed dry in a Blanket, while Mother <hi>Dulneſs</hi> enjoys the ſprightly Vein of Mirth, happy to ſee her Orders ſo faithfully executed. In ſhort, the unhappy Poets are to undergo every Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that human Wit can invent; and in Contraſt to this, Harlequin is to riot in Luxury; the Spring is to pour fourth her freſheſt Verdure to charm his Eye, Summer to ripen the various Fruits upon the loaded Boughs, in order to regale his Palate; Autumn muſt adminiſter the circling Glaſs, and Winter expand the frozen Surface of the Waters for him to ſkate with all his Dignity, in Sight of the aſtoniſhed Audience.</p>
                  <p>Though this Plan appeared highly romantic to me at firſt Sight, I could not help telling the Gentleman, that I made no doubt but he would find his Account in it. I told him, that the ſureſt Way to riſe in the World was to gratify the Follies of the People, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this Scheme, which I am convinced cannot fail of Succeſs. I juſt then hinted, that if he could contrive to be leſs violent in his Studies, I ſhould take it as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and after aſſuring him of my ſincere Wiſhes for all the Encouragement his Project deſerves, I took my leave, and am at preſent tolerably quiet in my Study, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above two or three Alarms in a Day, which muſt be now and then expected from ſo vigorous and warm an Imagination.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Sixth Book of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> has always been a Favourite with me, for the noble Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Morality, and the inimitable Strain of Poetry which run through it. I frequently read it with the moſt tranſporting Pleaſure, and, after finiſhing it, I cannot but look down very much upon the degenerate State of Poetry among the Moderns. For the ſtrong nervous Thought and natural Expreſſion, they have ſubſtituted pretty Conceit, quaint Phraſes, Turns, Strokes, and I know not what, tending to a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of Taſte among us. Filled with theſe Thoughts, I lately retired to reſt, when <hi>Queen Mab</hi> immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, and from the Mixture of Ideas fluctuating in my Mind, ſhe dreſſed up the following Scene to my Imagination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0311400902:128"/>I thought ſhe informed me, that the intellectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are divided into Diſtricts ſimilar to thoſe of the Nether-world, ſo admirably deſcribed by the Poet; I then fanſied that ſhe commanded me to ſet out on a Journey through the Head of a modern Writer, which, I inſtantly agreed to, and the Goddeſs accordingly took me in her Chariot. In a ſhort Time, we arrived at the Apartment, where the Bard ſat, <hi>ſicklied o'er with the pale Caſt of Thought.</hi> At my firſt Approach towards the intellectual Regions, a terrible Effluvium "proceeding," as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has it, "from the Heat-oppreſſed Brain," ſtruck my Senſes; but I was ſoon diverted from that uneaſy Senſation by a Perſonage, who offered to be my Guide. From a conſcious Simper, a careleſs Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Perſon, and the Tenor of his Diſcourſe, I knew him to be VANITY, and accepted the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our Way was through a thick Skull, of which we at once took Poſſeſſion, and plunged into the Abyſs.</p>
                  <p>At our firſt Entrance, a confuſed Noiſe aſſailed our Ears, and we were inſtantly beſet by a Number of Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms placed around the Portal. The God <hi>Somnus</hi> lay ſtretched at full Length, diffuſing round him lethargic Vapours and ſtupid Inſenſibility; a Group of wild <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Reveries</hi> hovered over him, and at a ſmall Diſtance flowed the River of <hi>animal Spirits,</hi> dull, ſlow, and lazy. Numbers were gathered round the Banks begging a Paſſage into this gloomy World, but the <hi>Charon</hi> of the Place, a torpid, decrepid Fellow, known there by the Name of PERCEPTION, gave a few of them a tardy Admittance, and to the greater Part he was entirely deaf. Among thoſe, whom he rejected, I perceived a Train, which I took for the nine <hi>Muſes,</hi> but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed they never had attempted to paſs that Way, and upon a nearer View I found they were the amiable Band of <hi>moral Virtues,</hi> who were highly deſirous of gaining Admittance, which was refuſed them, with the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0311400902:129"/>Addition of as much Inſolence in the Denial, as if they had been ſuing at a great Man's Door. They gave me to underſtand, that it is now become faſhionable to diſcard them every where, at which I could not help expreſſing great Uneaſineſs; and I then advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Boatman, PERCEPTION, who, with the Help of his Spectacles, at Length deſcried me, and received me into his Care.</p>
                  <p>The River had a great many Turnings and Windings (for <hi>ductile Dullneſs new Maeanders takes</hi>) but, after ſome Trouble, we at Length reached the oppoſite Bank. An uncultivated Tract lay before us, dreary, dark and gloomy; no Ray of Light to break through the Miſt; impenetrable Obſcurity involved the Scene, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours rolling over Vapours made every Thing an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Blot. I purſued my Journey with all poſſible Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and arrived at the <hi>Repoſitory of Ideas,</hi> as it is here called, the Key of which was kept by MEMORY. As I ſuppoſed this to be a Store-houſe of univerſal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I begged to be favoured with a View of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acquiſitions he had made. I deſired he would produce ſome <hi>occult Qualities,</hi> of which I had no Manner of Notion; and I called for ſeveral of the <hi>metaphyſical Train</hi> too tedious to enumerate; in <hi>Divinity</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ſeveral Things, of which I never could attain a clear Conception, and I have not Arithmetic enough to recount the Multitude of the <hi>Mathematical</hi> Species which I wanted; the Debates, which I have heard in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> gave me occaſion to enquire for many of the legal Band, and I was curious after an infinite Multitude of the <hi>Parnaſſian Tribe,</hi> mentioned in a pompous Stile in ſeveral modern Poets. I longed to ſee an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed Shaft, taking its fatal Aim, wind wafting Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on roſy Wings to Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. I begged a Sight of <hi>Colley Cibber</hi>'s old Friend BATTLE ARRAY, and the many other Poetic Beings, which he and others of his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0311400902:130"/>Brethren of the Quill, had created; but all to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>The next Place we came to was the <hi>Lugentes Campi,</hi> or the mournful Fields, ſacred to <hi>Venus.</hi> I met with nothing here but <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Darts, conſuming Fires, and all the modern Train of Love's Artillery. As I was ſufficiently acquainted with theſe, from a conſtant and unwearied Peruſal of our modern Tragedies and other poetical Productions, I haſtened to the Seat, where JUDGMENT preſided.</p>
                  <p>Judgment ſeldom made any Deciſions of his own, but was biaſſed in all his Decrees by ſeveral that ſurrounded him, with ſo much Authority, that I ſuppoſed they were in the Commiſſion. The Chief of theſe was PRIDE, with a lofty Air and ſupercilious Brow, which called to my Mind the excellent Remark in the Eſſay on Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm;
<q>
                        <l>Of all the Cauſes which conſpire to blind</l>
                        <l>Man's erring Judgment, and miſguide his Mind,</l>
                        <l>Which the weak Head with ſureſt Biaſs rules,</l>
                        <l>Is <hi>Pride,</hi> the never-failing Vice of Fools.</l>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>POPE.</hi>
                        </bibl>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next in Place was ILL-NATURE, callous and hardened to every gentle Senſation of Humanity, and quite a Stranger to that Delicacy of elegant Minds, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Merit of another with Pleaſure; but on the contrary, every Thing ſhining with the ſmalleſt Degree of Luſtre is the Object of his Averſion, and he is never pleaſed but with the Misfortunes of his Neighbours. PREJUDICE alſo ſeemed to have no ſmall Influence with the Court, and VENALITY, with itching Palm, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gave a new Turn to every Thing, being ready to engage on either Side in Politicks, to abuſe a worthy Character in Satire, or exalt a baſe one in dedicatory Panegyric.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Principles I could eaſily imagine to myſelf what Kind of Opinions were likely to ariſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0311400902:131"/>haſtened towards <hi>Elyſium.</hi> In my Way, I perceived a deſolate Tract, which may be called the Region of Tortures. Here I ſaw <hi>Grief, Deſpair, Envy, Revenge,</hi> and all the agonizing Cares, that made this Place worſe, than what the Poets fable of their <hi>Tartarus.</hi> In one Part was to be ſeen <hi>Ambition</hi> falling back, like the Stone of <hi>Siſyphus;</hi> in another Place, <hi>Hunger</hi> was tantalized with the Hopes of a Supper, but the worſt of Fiends, cruel <hi>Want</hi> forbids the Touch. Here ſtood a Pillory, with <hi>Defamation</hi> nailed to it by the Ears, there a Blanket ſtretched out, and a Bard going to be toſſed in it.— Here a tumultuous Play-houſe at the Damnation of a Virgin Muſe; the ſneering Beaux in the Boxes diſplay their falſe Teeth; the Pit riſes enraged, the Gallery open-its rude Throats, and nothing is to be heard but <q>throw him over—won't y' ha' ſome Orange Chips —won't y' ha' ſome Nonpareils—off the Stage, off,</q> till at Length the Catcal Whizzes, and the poor Poet in the mean Time is ready to expire, and Pangs as bad as Hell t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rment him.</p>
                  <p>Had I all the Pens of all the Scriblers of the Age, I ſhould not be able to relate every Occurrence in my Adventures, and I was by this Time admoniſhed by my Guide, that we were arrived at the Seat of Happineſs. Here we found <hi>Invention</hi> happy in a Review of all his airy Beings, that were fluttering round him in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated Dreſs, preſſing and crowding upon each other, as if to force a Paſſage into open Day. I ſtood for a Time wondering at this mighty Buſtle, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what might be the Cauſe of it. To which IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTION, <q>that bright Band which you behold ſo eagerly gathering about the Gates of Life, are the choſen Few, to whom <hi>Apollo</hi> has appointed a new Birth into the World, and they are now impatiently waiting till proper Bodies are prepared for them by thoſe <hi>poetical Midwives,</hi> commonly called <hi>Bookſellers.</hi> They were all in the Beginning waſted over by PERCEPTION,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0311400902:132"/>whom you have ſeen, and were thence conveyed to the Repoſitory of Ideas, in the Care of MEMORY, till in the various Courſe of human Contingencies, they are again called forth, and by my Skill, arranged in proper Order for their Appearance among the Sons of Men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus having ſaid, he led me round the whole Extent of <hi>Elyſium,</hi> gave me a compleat View of all his intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Train, and at Length diſmiſſed me through the Ivory Gate to breath the vital Air, to which I was highly pleaſed to find myſelf reſtored, and the Joy occaſioned by this Reflection operated ſo ſtrongly on my Spirits, that I felt myſelf in ſome Agitation, and was inſtantly wakened out of my Dream.</p>

                        <hi>Jack Oakſtick</hi> was indicted for that he, on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night the 16th of <hi>February,</hi> went into the Middle Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0311400902:135"/>at <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Play-houſe, and from thence one Apple, Value a Farthing, on the Stage did fling to the great Annoyance of the Actors, and Diſturbance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Fact was proved by two undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, who, being interrogated whether they had not the Freedom of the Houſe, ſeverally anſwered, that they had not, and added, that they did not even go in with an Order, and that their only Motive for appearing on the Occaſion was, to bring to condign Puniſhment an Offender againſt the Reſpect and good Manners due to a public Aſſembly. Whereupon the Priſoner, being aſked by the Court what he had to ſay for himſelf, made Anſwer that he was drunk, and, as he hoped to be ſaved, it was nothing but an innocent Frolick. GUILTY; upon which he was ordered to wait upon the Managers of the abovementioned Theatre to aſk their Pardon for his Miſbehaviour, and he was ſentenced to drink but a Pint of Wine after his Dinner for the future. —</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Peter Jeſſamy</hi> was indicted for ſtanding between the Scenes in ſuch a Manner as to hurt the moſt pathetic Situations of the Drama. GUILTY; but it appearing to the Court, that it was not done with Malice prepenſe, but only with intent to diſplay his Cloaths to the Ladies, he was diſmiſſed without any other Puniſhment than a ſevere Reprimand, and an Order, that he ſhould not be admitted behind the Scenes again without giving Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for his good Behaviour, of which Mr. <hi>Varney</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crudge</hi> are to take proper Notice.—</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Priſoner's Council</hi> proved to the Court, that their Client always preſerved her Virtue, and that no Inſtance of Infidelity to the Marriage-Bed could be charged againſt her, even though ſhe had been tempted by Lord <hi>Trumpabout,</hi> who offered to remit a conſiderable gaming Debt, for ſo ſmall a Conſideration as cuckolding her Huſband; and upon this they reſted their Defence.</p>
                     <p>To this it was replied by the Council for the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is not enough for a Woman to preſerve her Virtue, if ſhe is inſenſible to Shame in every other Point, agreeably to the <hi>Statute 6th Young,</hi>

                        <hi>John Cockney</hi> was indicted at the Suit of Mrs. <hi>Seeſaw,</hi> for that he, as a Servant to the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Seeſaw,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved ill in his Place, by ſeveral Miſdemeanors, ſuch as not anſwering when called, nor ſhutting the Room-Door after him, and, when bid, doing it in ſuch a Manner, as to ſhake the whole Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fact being proved, the Priſoner was aſked, what he had to ſay in Mitigation of his Offence; to which he replied, <q>I does not want to live with the Lady—I have often bid her diſcharge me—She keeps but ſeven Card-Tables—and what can a poor Servant do, if he gets no more Vails nor that?—It is not the Pay of a Country Curate—Lord bleſs her, ſhe may get

                     <p>Upon this the Priſoner reſted his Cauſe, and the Jury, without retiring, brought in their <hi>Verdict, a Male Jilt,</hi> and the Court adjudged, upon the Statute of <hi>Iſaac Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi> that no Lady whatever ſhould admit the Addreſſes of <hi>John Vainlove,</hi>

                     <p>Lady <hi>Tittle-Tattle</hi> was indicted, for that ſhe went fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to one or other of the two Theatres, and there, placing herſelf in a Side-Box as near the Stage as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, talked louder than the Actors, even though a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> or a <hi>Barry,</hi> a <hi>Cibber</hi> or a <hi>Pritchard</hi> were Principal in the Scene. The Priſoner, inſtead of denying the Fact, inſiſted upon her Right to behave in that Manner, alledging it was what ſhe always did at Church, and truly ſhe could never be made to hold her Tongue in her Life. Verdict, GUILTY; upon which the Court was going to paſs Sentence that ſhe ſhould loſe her Tongue, but one of the Judges recollecting an Inſtance in <hi>Ovid,</hi> where the remaining Roots and Fibres retain their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, <hi>Radix micat ultima linguae,</hi> objected to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſiſting upon it, that it would not cure the Diſeaſe, and though no articulate Accents could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, <hi>nec vox nec verba ſequuntur,</hi> yet ſuch Sounds might iſſue, as would ſtill continue to annoy the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; ſhe was therefore required to give Bail for her good Behaviour for the future, which ſhe found difficult to do, as her Huſband, for Reaſons beſt known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, refuſed to be one; at length Mr. <hi>Hoyle</hi> became her Security, he being in Poſſeſſion of the only Charm which can for a while ſtop the female Tongue.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O endeavour at ſome Degree of Self-Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was the conſtant Advice of the ethic Writers among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> and this Precept we find inculcated by each of them in Terms that come home to every Man's Breaſt. Among the Moderns, my Lord <hi>Shaſtſbury,</hi> has more particularly enforced the Doctrine to the Race of Writers, and has recommended this intuitive Intercourſe to every Author, by deſiring him frequently to enter into a <hi>Soliloquy</hi> with himſelf; by which Means he will probably ſtand informed, whether he can boaſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Harmony, which is requiſite for the Formation of a taſteful Mind; whether he is ſufficiently acquainted with the Progreſs of the human Underſtanding, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Movements of the Heart, the Grace of Character, the Beauty of Virtue, and all thoſe elegant Refinements of Thinking, without which it is impoſſible to reach any Degree of Excellence in a Compoſition. We likewiſe find that <hi>Boileau,</hi> the famous <hi>French</hi> Satyriſt, was aware of the Neceſſity of this ſpiritual Retreat (if I may be allowed to call it ſo) and accordingly he has entered into a Review of himſelf in his ninth Satire, which is certainly as pleaſant a Piece of Humour and Raillery, as ever was produced by any Writer antient or modern. The Poet addreſſes himſelf to his own Mind, by ſaying,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0311400902:146"/>that he wants to hold a little private Converſation with that internal Agent, whom he had too long encouraged in Whims and Frolicks, by an indolent Indulgence; and, now that his Patience is provoked to the utmoſt, he will, once for all, tell him his own.

Obſerve how ſome People lock up their Minds in Company; Snug's the Word; not a Syllable from their Lips, and they make Uſe of all they can extract from your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Diſpoſition. Look ye, if you would but keep my Secrets a little cloſer, I don't in the leaſt doubt but we ſhould ſucceed much better. Don't be quite ſo precipitate, and let us take Time to plan, to alter, to touch, and retouch, and I'll ſtake my Immortality, that we go on with more Safety and Eaſe. Or, if you muſt take the Opinion of People, aſk it of thoſe only who have both Inclination and Capacity to ſerve you, Learn to diſtinguiſh between Men.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Stoic Philoſophy was by many of the Antients eſteemed the Height of human Wiſdom, the ſure Road to Happineſs, and the laſt Finiſhing and Apotheoſis of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Character. Its Excellence conſiſted, not in the due Government of the Paſſions, but in extirpating them totally from the human Heart; by which means the Seat of feeling, and Source of every exquiſite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as well as tender Pain, was rendered quite cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and inſenſible, and ſuffered to move only with the Flux and Reflux of the Blood, without being agitated with any Kind of Senſation whatever. Our excellent Poet has given us a very pictureſque Deſcription of this notable Syſtem of Philoſophy.</p>

                  <p>How an abſolute Repugnance to the Laws of Nature, and the Want of thoſe Feelings, which are the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in our Compoſition, can in any Way conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an exalted Character I am at a loſs to determine. <hi>Vita ſecundum Naturam,</hi> a Life conformable to the Laws of Nature, is <hi>Tully</hi>'s Definition of a moral, as well as an happy State. Certain it is, all Elegance of Mind,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0311400902:153"/>and Reliſh for Virtue, muſt ariſe from thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, which Nature has implanted in us, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to Action, and Inlets for due Degrees of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Pain. Without theſe, our moſt refined Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications muſt ſuffer a conſiderable Abatement; the pleaſing Anxieties of virtuous Friendſhip, the grateful Solicitude of Love, the melancholy Luxury of tender Compaſſion, and the Delights which we derive from a well-wrought Scene of Diſtreſs in an affecting Tragedy, muſt all loſe their Influence, and the Mind ſink into a dull State of Inſenſibility. For my Part, I have always had a ſovereign Contempt for the unfeeling, pedantic Wiſdom of thoſe unnatural Followers of a brutal Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; nor could I ever admire their ridiculous Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a towering Superiority of Soul. That this is alſo the Senſe of the greater Part of Mankind, is very viſible from that ſoporific Awe, with which they behold Perſonages of this Caſt, when interwoven into the Drama; while Characters of a mixed Nature, in whom the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are in a beautiful Struggle between Virtue and Vice, are always ſure to ſeize the Affections of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and intereſt every Heart in the Fortunes of the Hero thus repreſented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> has tranſmitted to us a Picture of the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Happineſs, which was the exalted Boaſt of the Stoics: In the Words of my Motto, he tells us, that the Perſon, whom he deſcribes in the Poſſeſſion of true Felicity, is never touched with popular Eſteem, or the dazling Splendor of the regal State; that Difference between Brothers, Conſpiracies againſt his Country, or the Decline of the Conſtitution, never diſturb his Breaſt; nor is he ever made uneaſy by Compaſſion for the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, or Envy towards the great. This is a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter totally different from the amiable Sketch, by his Brother Poet, of the Man who conſiders the Relations in which he ſtands to Society, and feels for all Mankind. The negative Enjoyments above deſcribed can reſult
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0311400902:154"/>from nothing but an abſolute Indifference to our Fellow-Creatures, and is ſo far from being commendable, that, in my Opinion, it is equalled by every Debauchee in Town. I was lately in Company with one of this Claſs, who appeared to me to be a very great Proficient in the Stoic Philoſophy, and to have carried into his Practice, every Branch of the foregoing Syſtem, and as a further Inſtance of the Excellence of the Stoic School, I ſhall here preſent my Readers with a Character of a modern Stoic Philoſopher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jack Wildair</hi> is poſſeſſed of a Fortune, which might enable him to live with Splendor, or to proſecute any Enterprize in the Service of his Country; he has alſo the Advantages of Birth, to render him reputable in the Eye of the World; but like a true Philoſopher he never placed any Value upon theſe happy Circumſtances. With a noble Contempt for Riches, he ſquanders away his Subſtance in a Manner which ſhews him to be above the mean Ambition of popular Applauſe; and, inſtend of being arrogantly elated with the Thoughts of his high Birth, he has been known to aſſociate with the loweſt of Mankind, ſo ſuperior is he to thoſe little Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Pride which might be apt to play about the Heart of a Man of worldly Vanity. Contented in his own Mind, he never condeſcended to court the Favour of his Countrymen at an Election for Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>populi Faſces</hi> have never had any Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Jack Wildair,</hi> and ſo little is he touched with the Splendor of Majeſty, that he does not care for any King in <hi>Europe.</hi> While all our Politicians have made the two <hi>Brothers</hi> the conſtant Object of their Attention, he is little ſollicitous whether there be a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them or not. The Fortifications of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Depredations of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> upon our Merchantmen, the Election of the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Equipment of <hi>French</hi> Fleets, and all the other Points of Moment, which engroſs the Thoughts
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0311400902:155"/>of our preſent Race of Patriots, never once diſcompoſed the Serenity of his Mind. Liberty and Property are to him unideal Sounds, and if <hi>Magna Charta</hi> were burned by the common Hangman, it would not occaſion the leaſt Gloom in our Hero's Soul. He can alſo behold the Diſtreſſes of the Indigent, the corroding Anxieties of Poverty, moſt Stoic like, without a ſingle Sigh. <hi>Nec doluit miſerans inopem;</hi> and ſo far from being envious of another's Superiority in Life, while he is eaſy himſelf, he never was yet known to compare his own Situation with any Man above him, though he has now and then condeſcended to caſt a Look beneath him, with no ſmall Degree of Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the Firmneſs of <hi>Wildair</hi>'s Mind reſt here. He can viſit all the Brothels in this Metropolis, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling the leaſt Degree of Uneaſineſs. He can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, undiſturbed by any of thoſe tender Touches, which might agitate weaker Breaſts, an elegant Form, and the moſt beautiful Set of Features falling a Prey to <hi>Inſamy, Diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>Proſtitution;</hi> and as the antient Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies thought it a noble Atchievement totally to forget the Man, in order to raiſe their philoſophic Fame to an higher Degree of Eminence, ſo our modern Stoic can fat preſs the natural Affections, and in the Rake he can alſo forget the Man. <hi>Jack Wildair</hi> is a very <hi>Roman</hi> in that Point; he is an excellent Practitioner of <hi>Horace</hi>'s golden Rule, to admire nothing; and, if confined to the Ped of Sickneſs, to repair the Waſte made by Folly and Intemperance, he is ſure to ſpend his Time in a Series of moral Reflections. He wiſely obſerves, that all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is fugitive; that the Reverſion of Pain falls to every Man's Lot; and that the Condition of human Life is frail and uncertain. When his Health returns, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges in all the Sallies of his wild Imagination, to ſhew, that, like <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> he can adapt himſelf to every Situation.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE pantomime Poet, from whom I ſome Time ago felt a little Interruption in my Studies, has remained in the Chambers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my. Head ever ſince; but, the Fervour of his Enthuſiaſm being a good deal abated, he has proved a very peaceable and quiet Neighbour. For though he cannot entirely refrain from his peripatetic Lucubrations, he is, however, careful to conduct them with a Degree of Temperance, and he now proves a Companion of very ſingular and entertaining Oddities. The other Morning he paid me a Viſit, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in the Beginning to converſe with me upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary Topics, upon which he diſcourſed with ſufficient Sedateneſs. At length he took occaſion to introduce the Subject which was the Cauſe of his Viſit, and I obſerved, that the Moment he touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his favourite Scheme of Thinking, he betrayed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral whimſical Geſtures, and an extraordinary Manner of Addreſs. <q>Sir, ſays he, I have taken the Liberty to intrude upon you this Morning, in order to conſult you in Relation to a Work, which I have had in Hand for ſome Time paſt, and which I think cannot fail to be of public Utility, as it is one of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderata in Literature, and a Species of Criticiſm likely to be productive of ſingular Advantages to the learned World. The Thing I mean, Sir, is THE ART OF PANTOMIME, which I propoſe to publiſh by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, not noubting but I ſhall meet with ſuitable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0311400902:159"/>Encouragement to proſecute ſo arduous a Taſk, and if Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi> will be kind enough to favour me with his Recommendation, I ſhall for the future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him, as a generous Promoter of the polite Arts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to be able to comply with my Friend's Requeſt, and to ſerve him as effectually as my ſmall Abilities will permit me, I deſired him to explain to me at large the Plan of his Undertaking, and the whole Method, which he had chalked out to himſelf for ſo noble a Work. Upon which I was informed, that he intends to execute his Deſign, in Imitation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Art of Poetry,</hi> divided into as many Sections, and, as near as the Nature of the Subject will admit, comprized under the ſame Heads. His firſt Chapter is to ſet out with an Account of the imitative Arts, in which Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomime will be proved to be ſuperior to all the Reſt, having the greateſt Variety of Geſticulation, and the moſt expreſſive Significance in all its Attitudes and Actions. In the next Section, it will appear what Sort of Perſons and Things are proper for Imitation, and that the Pantomime Poet muſt either attach himſelf to the Repreſentation of Perſonages above the ordinary Race of human Nature, ſuch as Magicians, Enchanters, Genii, Gods, Imps, and Monſters, Devils, Furies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to the Exhibition of Characters to be met with in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occurrences of Life, ſuch as we find introduced in <hi>Harlequin Ranger.</hi> Then follows a Diſſertation upon the proper Manner of imitating, and Enquiry into the Origin of Pantomime, tracing it from the Time of <hi>Herace</hi> down to the glorious Time of Mahomet <hi>Carathra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, our Author proceeds to examine into the Nature of <hi>Farces,</hi> and ſhows how they differ from the <hi>Pantomime.</hi> He then enters more minutely into the Laws of <hi>Pantomime,</hi> and gives an Account of it's ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts. Among theſe the Fable is firſt conſidered, and it is allowed, it may be either ſimple or implex. He does
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0311400902:160"/>not totally reject the former, but inſiſts principally upon the Beauties of the complicated Plot, ſuch as <hi>Harlequin Sorcerer,</hi> or the Loves of <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proſerpine; Harlequin Fortunatus</hi> being of the ſimple Kind, conſiſting of one Action only, impeded or accelerated by ſeveral Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, all tending in a direct Line to the Completion of the Whole.</p>
                  <p>The refined Beauties of the Art offer themſelves next, and our Author exhauſts all his Erudition, all his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric, and all his whole Stock of Criticiſm, to point out the Advantages ariſing to a Piece from a well conducted <hi>Peripetia,</hi> which he defines in theſe Words. <q>The pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomimical <hi>Peripetia</hi> conſiſts in ſudden Changes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ariſing from a Concatenation of Incidents high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable in their Nature.</q> Then the <hi>Agnitio</hi> is diſplayed at large, and proved to be the livelieſt Beauty in this Species of the Drama, it being a ſudden Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in the Perſonages of the Piece, when, after a long Abſence, they recognize, and know each other again. As when <hi>Harlequin</hi> finds Acceſs to his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombine</hi> in a diſguiſed Appearance, ſhe by ſome Token diſcovers her Lover, and is happy in his Embrace.</p>
                  <p>After having enforced theſe ſtriking Particulars, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers Rules for the Excitement of Terror, Pity, and the Marvellous. The two former he mentions but ſlightly, not thinking them eſſential in theſe Compoſitions, but in the Marvellous, he obſerves, conſiſts the utmoſt Effort of human Genius, and then enumerates the various Means by which it is excited, ſuch as flying Mercurys, Rope-Dancers, Kicking Straws, Children playing on the Flute, Storms of Rain, Thunder and Lightening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Diviſion of the Work, relates to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of each Perſonage of the Drama, in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends a ſerious Attention to Character, in order the more forcibly to unfold Men and Manners, and the Cuſtoms, the Intrigues, the Flights and Deſcents of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0311400902:161"/>Gods, with the whole Hiſtory of the Heathen Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. In this Part of the Work he expatiates at large upon the Uſe of Machinery, and I make no Doubt, will greatly excel the celebrated <hi>Boſſu</hi> in this Part of the Performance. Having the Intereſts of the Theatre greatly at Heart, our Author proves, that no Play-houſe can long ſubſiſt without a good Set of Carpenters, an expeditious Band of Scene-Drawers, excellent Candle-Snuffers, Fire-Eaters, Trap-Door-Men, Oſtriches, Monkeys, Serpents, and the whole animal World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Race of Beings never ſeen upon the Face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Sentiment comes into Conſideration in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter. The ſeveral Modes of the Mind are explained in an ample Manner, and Directions given to the Performer to render himſelf perfectly acquainted with the Operation of all the Paſſions on the whole Frame of the Body, and it is laid down as a Rule that he muſt be careful to mark the different Actions of Begging Commanding, Threatning, Interrogating, Anſwering, that he may be able to impreſs a lively Idea of each up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Minds of his Spectators.</p>
                  <p>The Sentiment being eſtabliſhed, the Diction claims our next Regard. Under this Head the ſeveral pretty Pieces of Poetry introduced into <hi>Pantomimes</hi> are criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and proper Rules preſcribed for Writing theſe Kind of Nonſenſe—Verſes. To the whole Work is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a particular Examen of <hi>Harlequin Fortunatus,</hi> in order to give a Specimen of the great Utility and Truth of the foregoing Rules. I ſhall therefore conclude this Paper with an Abſtract from this Part of the Work.</p>
                  <p>There cannot, ſays my Author, be ſound in any Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomime Writer a better imagined Opening for the Drama, than the firſt Incident in this Piece. The Scene diſcovers a large Wood, in which the poor, forlorn Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin is wandering, in a violent Storm of Rain, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightening. In a Fit of Deſperation he throws
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0311400902:162"/>himſelf on the Ground, and to heighten our Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion poor Madam <hi>Fortune</hi> is introduced bemoaning her Condition in a very pathetic Strain of Poetry. The ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Character of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> is ſeen in his Readineſs to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed, and the Sequel conveys a fine Moral, <hi>viz.</hi> that Riches, Riot, and Debauchery are the moſt deſirable Things in this World, as the Piece ends with Harlequin's being in the full Enjoyment of all his Wiſhes. The Farmer's Yard affords a pleaſing Image of rural Happineſs, and the beautiful Incident of the Dog's biting the Clown conveys this Incident, that a Dog's obeyed in Office, and it ſerves further to enforce the Neceſſity of an Act of Parliament to leſſen the Number of Dogs, which over-run the Kingdom, to the great Annoyance of his Majeſty's loyal Subjects. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Remembrances between <hi>Columbine</hi> and her <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lequin</hi> make upon all Occaſions an admirable <hi>Agnitio,</hi> and the ſudden Changes of their Fortunes form a very beautiful <hi>Peripetia.</hi> Harlequin's Eſcape into the Oven, his running up the Chimney, and his Leap over the Gateway, when his Enemies are in cloſe Purſuit of him, are all Touches of the higheſt Elevation and Genius, and upon the whole, we may ſay with Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> that this Piece is admirable for its fine Moralities, its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, and its Integrity.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had the Honour, in one of my former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, of introducing my Readers into that celebrated Academy of Arts and Sciences, THE ROBIN HOOD SOCIETY, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in as flouriſhing a Condition as ever. Laſt <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> I was ſo happy as to attend the Debates of this learned Body, and with Pleaſure I reflected, that the Seat of Inveſtigation, Knowledge, and Senſe is now likely to be fixed in BUTCHER-ROW. In Imitation of <hi>Spratt</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Royal Society, I have ſome Thoughts of collecting together the Annals of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Aſſembly, the Members of which have nothing ſo much at Heart, as the Diſcovery of Truth, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is common to hear a bare-footed Shoemaker ſettle a Point in Philoſophy; a Taylor in Rags prove, that a <hi>Remnant of all ſhall be ſaved;</hi> an Attorney bring his Writ of Error againſt Revelation; a <hi>Philomath</hi> from <hi>Aberdeen</hi> confute the eſtabliſhed Religion and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent Tradeſman, chiefly ſollicitous about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Debt. In ſhort, ſuch a Spirit of Free Enquiry reigns in this Seminary, that you may ſee Journeymen-Barbers, Hackney-Clerks, Porters, Chairmen, Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Coachmen, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> all actuated with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enthuſiaſm, and by Turns pleading for Rewards and Puniſhments, the Exiſtence or Non-Exiſtence of a Deity, the moral Fitneſs of Things, the eternal Rule of Right, and in half an Hour they are <hi>Shaftſburians, Hutchenſonians, Mandevillians, Muggletonians, Theiſts, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi> &amp;c. During the Courſe of their Reſearches the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0311400902:165"/>Students are frequently obſerved to make ſuch vigorous Application to certain Pewter Pots lying before them, and to draw from thence ſuch copious Draughts, that it is by many imagined the Academy has found out, that the Ancients were miſtaken, when they ſuppoſed TRUTH to be in the Bottom of a Well; this coy and retired Goddeſs, in the Opinion of the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, being to be found at preſent in the Bottom of a <hi>Pot of Porter.</hi> Be that as it may, certain it is, the noble Syſtem of Free-thinking is here diſplayed in it's genuine Luſtre, as, I fancy, will appear from the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, with which I ſhall fill up the Remainder of this Day's Paper.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I am againſt Operas, for this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Reaſon; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe moſt of them are compoſed by People ignorant of the firſt Principle of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is <hi>Counterpoint,</hi> or the Art of placing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Notes, ſounding together in true harmonic Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Muſick, Sir, conſiſts of <hi>Melody</hi> and <hi>Harmony. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody</hi> is the regular Progreſſion of a ſingle Part; and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> of different Parts united. Now the <hi>Melody</hi> of all the Songs in our late <hi>Italian</hi> Operas is extravagant and unnatural, conſequently unpleaſing, and ſitter for Inſtruments than Voices. Their Singers are conſtantly endeavouring to ſurprize, by which Means, their Songs are all Quirks and Diviſions, and the Performers are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0311400902:170"/>ſometimes ſqueaking like Cats at the Top of a Houſe, and ſometimes growling like Dogs in a Cellar. The Energy of the Words is totally neglected, and the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is entirely loſt; and therefore I cannot help won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that, while we have <hi>Handel, Arne, Boyce,</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will laviſh Sums upon a falſe and depraved Taſte, merely to be thought Judges of what they do not underſtand. I ſhall finiſh, Sir, with aſſerting, that an elegant <hi>Drama,</hi> by a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the Muſic compoſed by either of the Maſters mentioned already, might be a high and rational En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; it would certainly ſave an immenſe Sum to the Nation, and would excite ſome new Genius's to ſtudy, and excel all other Nations, in manly, ſenſible Compoſitions, where the Sound would be an Echo to the Senſe, and the Paſſions would be agitated by the joint Power of Poetry and Harmony.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is not a Word, in the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, more groſly abuſed than the Term <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> which, at preſent, means no more than that Men eat together, walk together, game together, und are grave and merry, drunk and ſober together, without ever conceiving any real Regard for each others Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Intereſt. I believe every Day's Experience will point out many, who are Dupes to this florid Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0311400902:171"/>of Friendſhip. In the Courſe of my Obſervation I have marked out a particular Character that falls more egregiouſly into this Error, than the reſt of Mankind. The Character I mean is that of THE COMICAL FEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW, or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL, or THE CURSED HIGH FELLOW, or THE MAN OF INFINITE HU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOUR, or THE GENIUS, or by whatever Name (for many Names will ſuit him) you may pleaſe to diſtinguiſh the Perſon, whom a cheerful Flow of Spirits, and a quick Circulation of the Ideas, that fall to his Share, conſpire to render an entertaining Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
                  <p>The COMICAL FELLOW, is in high Requeſt among all his Acquaintance; and different Parties at the <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear,</hi> the <hi>Bedford-Arms,</hi> the <hi>King's-Arms,</hi> &amp;c. are vying with each other to have him the Maſter of the Joke in their convivial Parties, becauſe he is without Doubt the fineſt Creature in the World to kill an Hour with, the merry Droll has ſuch Variety of Chat, and ſuch a deal of Humour in telling a Story. But while this Son of Gaiety and Wit is thus happy in the Careſſes of all the Lovers of Mirth, this ſecret Misfortune attends him, that he has not any where procured himſelf the leaſt Degree of Eſteem, becauſe it is too well known, that he has not a ſingle Virtue under the Sun, that he would at any Time, according to the common Saying, rather loſe his Friend than his Joke, that no Obligation can bind him, but that indiſcriminately he laſhes all alike, and is conſtantly upon the look out for ſome Incident, which by a Perverſion of Circumſtances, or by a few Touches of Mimickry, or ſome other adventitious Aid, may be worked up into a Story for the Entertainment of the next Company he goes into. On this Account THE AGREEABLE DEVIL is held in utter Contempt; but the Vivacity of his Imagination will not afford him Leiſure to attend to this; his Vanity is fully gratified by the general Applauſe he meets with, and he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0311400902:172"/>exhauſting his ſcanty Finances in keeping Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a Set of People, who are good humoured enough to be perpetually entertained with his Jokes.—</p>
                  <p>I will venture to affirm, that few Evils are more epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, than this Rage of being an HIGH-FELLOW, and I am apt to think, that many of thoſe Bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which fill the Columns of the <hi>Gazette,</hi> are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely owing to Loſſes in Trade, but to the pitiful Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of diſcovering a fine Vein of Humour. When once the ſober Cit becomes the Ringleader in Wit and frolick Feſtivity, when once he has learned to <hi>elevate and ſurprize,</hi> his Shop aſſumes a gloomy Aſpect; Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping is but a dull Employment, unfit for Men of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ner Senfations, and inſtantly his fervid Imagination conveys him to the <hi>Gentleman and Porter;</hi> then he cracks each Joke over again, and thrice he enjoys the Laugh, and thrice repeats the Pun. But in a little Time, his Name is inſerted in the <hi>Gazette</hi> with a WHEREAS; his former Companions ſhake their Heads, and are very ſorry for it; <q>he was a Wag, a merry Man; a CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MICAL FELLOW,—but Buſineſs is a ſerious Thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Poor <hi>Jack Spatter!</hi>—He is at preſent the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of all THE AGREEABLE DEVILS I have ever known. <hi>Jack</hi> does not want a Share of native Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and he dreſſes up a Story at ſecond hand with ſuch additional Touches, that a Man is frequently as much entertained as if he had never heard it before, or if he himſelf had not told it to him the very Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore. For it is often the d'verting Rogues Way unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly to faſten with <hi>ſomething curſea High</hi> upon the very Perſon, who at firſt ſupplied him with the Subject. And then THE GENIUS is ſuch a Mimick!—Well to be ſure nothing can eſcape him. A Cat, a Dog, a Monkey, a Manager, a <hi>Burletta-Girl,</hi> a <hi>Woodward,</hi> a <hi>Garrick,</hi> all muſt undergo the Touches of his humouróus Imitation, and mean while, the Company, Whores, Waiters and all, do ſo laugh, and ſo ſhake their Side,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0311400902:173"/>that Life is quite flat and inſipid without <hi>Jack Spatter.</hi> But in this World, where, as <hi>Moliere</hi> ſays, <hi>on donne rien pour rien,</hi> where every Thing muſt be paid for, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but prove very expenſive to be thus aſpiring in Company. But <hi>Jack</hi>'s Vanity extends to Expence, as well as Wit and Humour. How many Shifts have I known him to make, that he might diſplay his Vivacity at the Tavern!—A Turtle-Feaſt was ſometime ſince fixed at the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Arms</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and <hi>Spatter</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to make one. "A Turtle Feaſt," ſays <hi>Jack,</hi> 
                     <q>very well!—it can't be better—Citizens laugh hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily when their Bellies are full—I'll certainly go— but how to pay my Reckoning!—There's <hi>Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,</hi> the Bookſeller;—he likes a Touch of my Humour—he'll tip me two Guineas for an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue—I'll write him one—let me ſee what's here?—<hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Miſcellany!</hi>—I'll tranſcribe one from this.</q>—No ſooner ſaid than done, for <hi>Jack</hi> has quick Parts, and away he ſets out towards <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> meets his Friend <hi>Humdrum</hi> at <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> reads the Piece to him, to ſhew what a COMICAL DEVIL he is; <hi>Humdrum</hi> admires it; <hi>Jack</hi> forgets that he ſtole it, and admires it more, touches Two Guineas from <hi>Title-page,</hi> and who but he at the Turtle-Feaſt? A <hi>Maſquerade</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſomewhat a larger Capital. "Egad," ſay <hi>Jack,</hi> 
                     <q>I'll write a Pamphlet for that, and touch Five Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</q>—To work he falls, and finiſhes his Piece in the Space of one Morning, though it coſt the Original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors from whom he compiled it, many nocturnal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils. A Jant to <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> in the Summer Seaſon, with ſome Lovers of Wit and Humour could not but be agreeable to Mr. <hi>Spatter;</hi> and ſo inſtantly he ſets down and writes a Farce; and becauſe <hi>Fielding</hi>'s <hi>Coffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe Politician</hi> is not very likely to be acted again on either of our Stages, what does the merry Wag do, but he takes the Character, gives it a new Name, makes a little Alteration in the Scene, where the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0311400902:174"/>
                     <hi>Politician</hi> reads the News-Papers, and inſtantly <hi>Genial Jacob, and a warm third Day,</hi> as the Poet has it, equips the GENIUS for <hi>Tunbridge.</hi> Thus is the CURSED HIGH FELLOW, the AMIABLE FRIPON, perpetually ſpending the Income of his Brain, and torturing his Invention in Endeavours to live with thoſe, who have Fortunes to ſupply their Expences, and who do not entertain the leaſt Symptom of Friendſhip towards their merry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. What will become of him, when he has played all his Tricks, I tremble to think, and, as if his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes were now preſent, I cannot help crying out, <q>Alas, poor <hi>Yorick!</hi>—I knew him, a Fellow of infinite Jeſt—where be your Gibes now? Your Flaſhes of Merriment, that were wont to ſet the Table on a roar?—Quite Chop-fallen!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But my Fancy has pictured this Scene of Diſtreſs ſo ſtrongly to me, that I could wiſh ſome Means could be deviſed to avert the impending Evil. An Ingenious Gentleman, whom I have the Pleaſure of knowing, propoſed ſome Time ſince a Scheme for an HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED POLTS. Suppoſe, in Imitation of this laudable Deſign, an Hoſpital were to be raiſed for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS. For my Part, I cannot but think the Plan ſhould meet with general Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I will willingly give the Profits of this Paper, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 79, towards carrying it into Execution. Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> will, I dare ſay, contribute on their Parts an annual Benefit towards this Charity, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of which may be admitted, as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It being certified to us, that the Bearer—<hi>A.B.;</hi> was an AGREEABLE DEVIL, and entirely ruined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by endeavouring to keep Company with Men of Fortune, who countenanced him merely as their Jeſter, you are hereby directed to admit the ſaid unhappy pleaſant Creature into the Hoſpital for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS, <hi>London</hi>—<hi>Signed by Two Directors.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0311400902:175"/>
Should this Propoſal take Effect, I ſhall rejoice at being inſtrumental in the Redemption of ſo many diverting Creatures from utter Miſery; for ſurely it would be melancholy to reflect that he, who often enlivened even the ſprightly <hi>Champain,</hi> might become miſerably witty in an Ale-houſe, or be a joking <hi>Boot-catcher</hi> at an Inn, and tell your Honour a Story, while he is diveſting your Legs of their leathern Incumbrance. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope that all true Lovers of Humour will promote the Scheme, juſt hinted, for the ſake of thoſe, who ruin themſelves for their Pleaſure; and I ſhall be highly pleaſed that there will be a Receptacle for poor <hi>Jack Spatter,</hi> and that the AGREEABLE DEVIL may, in his old Days, find Repoſe in the HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS.</p>

He inveighed ſeverely againſt <hi>Stage-Players,</hi> and urged, it was a very great Hardſhip, that honeſt and worthy Characters ſhould be converted into Ridicule by the Buffoonery of an impertinent Player. For his Part, he would take upon him to ſay, that his Clients were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of known Integrity, Probity, and Honour, and he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0311400902:176"/>thought them more valuable Characters in Life than any Set of Comedians whatever.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muffin-Man,</hi> he inſiſted, was ſo reputable and worthy a Perſonage, that nothing but the Height of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence could induce a Mimic on the Stage to attempt to hurt him in his Reputation. If theſe Things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he could not determine where the Thing would end, and he himſelf, he added, might be treated in the ſame Sort; he therefore prayed, that the Gentlemen of the Jury would take the Premiſes into Conſideration, and award ſuitable Damages.

                  <stage>The Defence.</stage>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Shuter</hi>'s Council owned the Fact, but offered many Arguments in Mitigation. They inſiſted, it could not be of any material Detriment to the Plaintiffs, even allowing that they were mimicked. Why, thereſore, then, continued the Council, "I cannot perceive, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury <q>that my Client—a—has—incurred ſo ſevere a Penalty; becauſe why—it was not done with an evil Intent—and—a—my Client has but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Example of Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> who formerly availed himſelf of his Talents for this Species of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and took very pleaſant Liberties with all the Actors on the Stage. As did likewiſe—a—Mr.— <hi>Foote,</hi> who called it, if I remember right, <hi>giving Chocolate.</hi> Why therefore then, all that is to be ſaid in the preſent Caſe, is—a—that—my Client, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Jury, has given Chocolate to the <hi>Muffin-Man.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this the Jury withdrew, and in a few Minutes brought in their Verdict Not-Guilty; whereupon the Court diſmiſſed Mr. <hi>Shuter</hi> with Honour, and told him if he does but endeavour ſtrenuouſly to exert his comic Powers, with a cloſe Eye to Nature, he cannot fail to be an excellent Comedian. <hi>Adjourn'd.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Application of Part of our Time to Letters is recommended by the Author of my Motto in ſuch glowing Colourings, as ſerve at once elegantly to diſplay the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold Advantages reſulting from Study, and at the ſame Time prove an Incentive to every Mind to enlarge its Views, and encreaſe its Store of Ideas, by a due At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Labours of the Learned. "Letters," ſays the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator, <q>cheriſh and invigorate the Mind in its greener Years, amuſe it in the more advanced Periods of Life, beam a Luſtre on Proſperity, and ſoften the Shocks of Adverſity; they yield Delight in our domeſtic Hours, and are no Incumbrance abroad; they protract the Midnight-hour, are our Fellow-Travellers in foreign Parts, and make the beſt Part of Equipage in all our rural Excurſions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am aware, that the Tranſlation, which I have here offered, falls many Degrees ſhort of the Purity and graceful Strength of the Original; but ſuch as it is, it may, in ſome Sort, ſerve to inculcate the real Utility of a very pleaſurable Occupation, which is at preſent too much neglected by People of Condition of both Sexes. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> wonders how Men of Senſe can ſpend ſo many Hours together, without receiving any other Ideas than what are ſuggeſted, by an Arrangement of black
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0311400902:179"/>and red Spots. But ſuch is the prevailing Faſhion of the Times, that the <hi>Book of Four Kings</hi> is the only <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume</hi> at preſent peruſed with any Degree of Attention, and, I will venture to affirm, the <hi>Four motley Monarchs,</hi> are better beloved by ſeveral Perſons of Condition than any <hi>real King</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> A Friend of mine, who has a Knock in conforming all his Compoſitions to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Taſte of the Town, tells me very ſeriouſly, that he has often wondered how Men of Diſcernment can ſit down to Performances, which a little Experience Light inform them will never be read; ſuch as, the <hi>History of England,</hi> the <hi>Life of Harry the Seventh,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtory of Charles the Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtory of Lewis the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,</hi> &amp;c For his Part, he is determined to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the favourite Paſſions of his Readers, and is now actually employed in <hi>compiling Memoirs</hi> of the KING OF EPADES, the Annals of the KING OF CLUBS, Anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes relating to the KING OF HEARTS, Remarks on the KING OF DIAMONDS, including Battles more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable than thoſe of <hi>Creſſi</hi> and <hi>Poitiers,</hi> fought in the verdant Plains of <hi>Picquet, Cribbidge, Quadrille, Whiſt,</hi> &amp;c. in which will be interwoven the private Characters of the <hi>Knaves,</hi> with the ſecret Hiſtory of the <hi>Queens,</hi> their Intrigues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Work to be publiſhed in Numbers, Price One Guinea each Weekly Number; in proper Places will be inſerted a beautiful Copper-Plate of the <hi>Crowned-Heads and eminent Perſonages,</hi> taken from the original Drawings now in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Club at White</hi>'s; at the particular Deſire of ſeveral Perſons of Quality, five Thouſand Copies will be printed upon Royal Paper; the Subſcribers Names to be annexed with their Places of Abode, and how many Card-Tables each Perſon keeps, which may ſerve to give Poſterity ſome Idea of the Grandeur of the preſent Age.</p>
                  <p>I make no Doubt but this Work, if carried into Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, will be in great Demand, and, I am ſenſible, that a Diſinaſive from Purſuits of this Nature will be the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0311400902:180"/>Jeſt of every tittering Card-Table in Town. I muſt, however, beg Leave to inform my pretty Readers, that they are highly miſtaken, if they imagine, that, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating a few Hours to litterary Amuſements, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their lovely Features, and run a Riſque of dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſparkling Luſtre of the Eye. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a Page or two in a Morning may ſerve to adjuſt the Countenance, and the Acquiſition of a new Idea may give a more engaging Ornament to the Head, than a new <hi>Paris</hi> Cap, and the Eye will certainly beam with more Attention, when directed by an active Principle within, than when it ſwims round the Room in pretty, giddy, vain, ſenſeleſs Affectations? How ſinely has Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> deſcribed the Conſequences attending a Life ſpent thus in a Circle of Follic.!

                     </q> How much more eligible therefore is it to employ ſome Portions of our Time in a Way, that will furniſh the Mind with Ideas fit to be communicated to rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and give an Embelliſhment to the higheſt Sphere of Life. Add to this, that ſoftening Quality, which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have in all Caſes of Adverſity. In the Day of Affliction, the ſureſt and moſt certain Relief the Mind can receive, will be derived from the Habit of being converſant with Books. If I remember right. it is Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> that obſerves, in his <hi>Conduct of the Underſtanding,</hi> that a Power of transferring our Thoughts from one Object to another, is an Eſſential requiſite in a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Underſtanding. And ſurely nothing can better help to prevent the Mind from dwelling too long upon any habitual Set of Ideas, which may induce a ſettled
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0311400902:181"/>Form of Melancholy, than an Attention to the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, which Men of learned Leiſure have ſent into the World. Inſtead of urging any Thing further on this Subject, I ſhall conclude this Paper with a <hi>Journal for one Week</hi> of an Acquaintance of mine who never reads at all, and a <hi>Journal</hi> of another who devotes Part of his Time to Letters.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT to admire, is the golden Rule, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by <hi>Horace,</hi> for the Acquirement of inward Peace and Happineſs, and alſo for ſecuring the Tenure of them, when once obtained. The ſame Precept may alſo be enforced as the ſureſt Method to form a ſound Underſtanding, and to preſerve the Judgment free and undiſtempered. Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſay on Criticiſm,</hi> a Poem, in which good Senſe and Poetry are beautifully combined, has given this Obſervation the Sanction of a Maxim;
<q>
                        <hi>For Fools</hi> ADMIRE, but Men of Senſe APPROVE.</q>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0311400902:185"/>In our greener Years indeed, when the young Affections are, to uſe the Poet's Phraſe, <hi>tremblingly alive all o'er,</hi> when every Object preſents itſelf in ſome new and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Attitude, fond ADIMRATION may be then allowed to gaze, and each Incident in the Scene of Life may call forth the juvenile Expreſſions of Wonder and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But ſurely, when we become ſomewhat hackneyed in the Ways of Men, when Habit has coated over that Quickneſs of Senſation, which attends the raw and inexperienced Mind, the elevated Brow of Amazement may be expected to ſubſide to the ſober Caſt of Reflection and Knowledge. I am at preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Gentleman, who has made ſo many ſenſible Animadverſions on the various Occurrences of Life, that, I am convinced, nothing can arrive to excite in his Breaſt any Emotions of Surprize, and I have often heard him ſay very humorouſly, <q>Lord! I have already known ſo many unexpected Turns and Revolutions of Things, that were I to ſee the MONUMENT walk down <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and take out St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church to dance a Minuet, it would make no Manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my Spirits, no more than when I read that it will be High-Water at <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> at half paſt Ten.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the general Maſs of Life, there is ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Inanity in the Minds of moſt People, and the Groſs of Mankind are ſo ſcantily furniſhed with Ideas, that there are but few, who, when taken from their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Occupations, or their other Buſineſs, do not fall into a ſluggiſh Oſcitancy, for want of a Sufficiency of Matter to employ their intellectual Faculties. Thus by an habitual Remiſſneſs in reviewing the ordinary No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of Things, the Power of arranging and comparing our Ideas in their manifold Relations to each other, which we commonly call JUDGMENT, lies indolently dormant, and the Conſequence is, that, upon every Emergence, the idle Paſſions of Aſtoniſhment take
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0311400902:186"/>Poſſeſſion of the Soul. It is obſervable, that, this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is not always confined to the unenlightened Part of Mankind, but we may ſometimes perceive this mental Debility among thoſe, who, from their Education, and from their Intercourſe with the World, might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be ſomewhat more ſolid. There are, perhaps, in the Circle of my own Acquaintance, at leaſt half a ſcore Perſons, poſſeſſed of Talents capable of extenſive Diſcernment, and of thinking very juſtly upon any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Topics of Converſation, and yet, through an Habit of Inattention, ſuch a total Relaxation unſtrings their intellectual Powers, that they in Fact appear to have impotently pinned their Faith on other Mens Sleeves, and to have loſt all Kind of Capacity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelves. It is among ſuch People, and ſuch only, that THE COMICAL FELLOW, or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL, whom I have deſcribed in a former Paper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires his prodigious Reputation for Wit and Humour. Sir <hi>Andrew Wonderful</hi> has for ſome Time paſt been eſteemed a knowing one by his Neighbours in the Ward of <hi>Farringdon without,</hi> and in his Buſineſs, he is accounted a Man of very notable Dexterity; but ſpend the Evening with Sir <hi>Andrew</hi> at any Tavern on the St. <hi>James</hi>'s Side of <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and he is all Amazement from the Time he enters the Room, until his old, rumbling Coach conveys him back to the City. If you mention to him the Lie of the Day, that the Lady of a certain noble Lord was caught in Bed with a Lieutenant of the Guards, <q>Good Law! ſays Sir <hi>Andrew,</hi> you dont ſay ſo!</q>—It's very true though, and this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early a well-dreſſed Man walking acroſs <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s-<hi>Inn Fields</hi> fell down dead—<q>Dear Heart, ſays the Knight, you ſurprize me!</q>—Late laſt Night a Game at <hi>Whiſt</hi> was played at <hi>White</hi>'s Chocolate-houſe, on which upwards of three thouſand Pounds depended—<q>Three thouſand Pounds! I never heard of ſuch a Thing in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0311400902:187"/>my born Days—three thouſand Pounds!—Good Law!—Three thouſand Pounds!</q>—</p>
                  <p>Every Man, who is actuated with the laudable Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of being a rational Creature, ſhould endeavour to fix within himſelf ſuch Habits of thinking, as will keep him collected, and prevent his Thoughts from being ſcattered into wild Surprize upon every little Emergence that offers. There ſhould certainly be cheriſhed in every Breaſt an honeſt Pride in preſerving its own free Agency, and maintaining an Independency of Underſtanding, ſelf-impelled, and ſelf-directed; awakened into think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Impreſſions of its own Ideas, and adopting all its Principles and Maxims from the Suggeſtions of its own Judgment. For ſurely there can not be any Thing more unmanly, than leaving either the Faculties of the Soul, or the Muſcles of the Face to be played upon by the Will and Pleaſure of another. To have a Titter ready whenever the COMICAL FELLOW chuſes to be facetious, and to hold a Man's Belief at another's Diſpoſal, according as he chuſes to decide upon any Subject, moſt inconteſtibly indicates a weak and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>I was led into this Tract of Thought by a Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Manner, in which I ſpent an Evening, this Week, with three Gentlemen, who had ſollicited the Meeting with earneſt Importunity. During the laſt ſix Weeks, I never met any one of them, but he inſtantly began, <q>Well! my dear Boy, when ſhall we have an Evening—you know it is what we have long wiſhed for?</q>—At length the <hi>Rendezvous</hi> was fixed, and at the appointed Hour I met my Friends, not without very high Expectations of a pleaſant Evening. A Bottle of <hi>Allen</hi>'s in an Inſtant appeared on the Table, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with uncommon Celerity. I then expected my Friends to open ſome Vein of Diſcourſe, but all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in determined Silence, in order to break the Ice, I began with an ordinary Topic, and enquired about
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0311400902:188"/>
                     <hi>Elizabeth Canning.</hi> 
                     <q>I ſuppoſe, ſaid I, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reſolved to let her ſee foreign Parts.</q>— That's <hi>Humour,</hi> ſaid one of the Gentleman to his next Neighbour, and then they all burſt into a loud Laugh. I did not perceive the Joke, but, continued I. <q>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe is guilty or not, it will do her no Prejudice to ſee the World.</q>—"<hi>Humour</hi> again," ſays the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who ſat oppoſite to me; <q>You're a fine young Fellow,</q> ſays a ſecond; "This is high," ſays the third, and then all three formed a Chorus of Laughter. "The Captain, who carries her abroad," added I, <q>will have a good Contract of it; for he need give her nothing but Cruſts and Water for ſix and twenty Days, and ſhe'll ſubſiſt upon that.</q> 
                     <hi>Another Touch,</hi> ſays my Friend over the Way. <hi>Admirable!</hi> cries his Neighbour, and the Gentleman next to me, alarming me with a Slap on the Shoulder, roars out—"Odzouns," and then <hi>Laughter, holding both his Sides,</hi> took poſſeſſion of them for the Space of ten Minutes.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, I perceived, that my Company held more of ADMIRATION, than of JUDGMENT, and I became heartily tired of the Party; though, were I inclined to Self-Approbation, they omitted nothing that could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to my Vanity; the Gentleman oppoſite to me frequently teſtifying his Approbation with that's <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour!</hi> the ſecond, repeating, <hi>you're a fine young Fellow!</hi> and my next Neighbour thundering in my Ear his rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous <hi>Odzouns!</hi> which extraordinary Interjections were abſolutely the Sum total of all the Converſation, that I heard from theſe three notable Blanks in the Creation. I accordingly took occaſion to break up the Meeting as ſoon as poſſible, and upon retiring home to my Chambers could not help drawing up this looſe Eſſay, which I have ordered my Publiſher to ſend to each of the Gentlemen, in order, if poſſible, to cure them of their ſervile Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and inform them, if they deſire to be ranked
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0311400902:189"/>among Free-Agents, that their only Title to it conſiſts in thinking and judging for themſelves.</p>

                        <p>WERE I not to inform you, you would certainly never be able to gueſs at what Hour I have now ſet down to write to you, It is now almoſt Six in the Morning, and I have already ſpent half an Hour in an agreeable Attention to ſome certain domeſtic Cares, which have taken poſſeſſion of me ſince my Retreat to the Country. I am here a Kind of <hi>Pater-familias</hi> with all my little Brood of Hens and Chickens around me. I look upon myſelf to be greatly intereſted in their Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; their Wants, and their Inconveniencies it is my earneſt Care to remove. I am entirely converſant with their different Tempers, and can tell you the ruling Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of each of them. I can here ſhew a <hi>Bantham</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette, and a Prude from the other Side of the Line; among the Males I have a Coxcomb, a Bully, a Coward, and, in ſhort, almoſt all the Characters that offer in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life.</p>
                        <p>Since my riſing from my Pillow, I have interpoſed in two violent Feuds, and in this Manner am I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining myſelf, while my Friend <hi>Ranger</hi> is, perhaps, reeling home from ſome Tavern; or, it may be, like your admired <hi>Horace,</hi> tumbling and toſſing in reſtleſs Impatience for the Arrival of ſome deluſive Fair, whoſe Perſidy has carried her to a Rival's Arm's.

Give me leave here to addreſs you in the Words of the excellent Author of the Seaſons.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0311400902:192"/>
                           <q>
                              <l>

                              </l>
                              <l>

                              </l>
                           </q> Believe me, Dear <hi>Charles,</hi> the moſt jovial Three in the Morning at the <hi>Shakeypear,</hi> never can afford ſuch home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt Delight, as plays around the Heart-ſtrings in this calm Period of the Morning. The Mind is then cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſerene; Fancy is light and airy, and ſeems to threaten I know not what prodigious Things; every Object excites finer Feelings and more delicate Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than can be ſuggeſted to the <hi>heat-oppreſſed Brain,</hi> as <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> phraſes it.</p>
                        <p>Prithee, honeſt <hi>Ranger,</hi> how long is it ſince you ſaw the Sun riſe? I dare believe not ſince we were together at <hi>Eaton.</hi> But ſurely, if this Phaenomenon had not very expanſive Beauties, the Poets would never have been ſo fond of ſeizing every Opportunity to deſcribe it. Since I have mentioned this Circumſtance among the Poets, I muſt obſerve, that our great Dramatic Bard has in two Paſſages excelled all the Writers from the Days of <hi>Homer,</hi> down to the preſent State of modern Poetry, in their favourite Openings of the Morn. The Saffron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctured Fingers of <hi>Aurora,</hi> the Sun riſing from <hi>Thetis</hi>'s Lap, the Daughter of the Dawn coming from the Bed of <hi>Tithonus,</hi> are, in my Opinion, all poor and ineffectual, when compared with the more natural Deſcription in <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet;</hi>
                           <q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>—Jocund Day</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Stands tiptoe on the miſty Mountain's Top.</hi>
                              </l>
                           </q> I have compared this admirable Piece of Imagery, for ſeveral ſucceſſive Mornings, with the real Object in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and I really am at a Loſs which to admire moſt; like the travelling <hi>Perſian,</hi> who, when the Reflection of the ſolar Rays (as happens ſometimes in thoſe Countries)
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0311400902:193"/>have formed in a Cloud another imaginary Sun, gazes at both with reverential Eyes, in doubt with himſelf to which he ſhall offer his Morning Adoration. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paſſage I mean, is, in the Tragedy of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> where after ſeeing the Ghoſt of the deceaſed King, <hi>Horatio</hi> breaks off with,
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>But ſee the Morn in Ruſſet-mantle clad.</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Walks o'er the Dews of yon high eaſtern Hill.</hi>
                              </l>
                           </q> You know the Poets are fond of perſonalizing both phyſical and moral Qualities, in order to give Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Poetry, and to throw Things as much as poſſible into Action; and here, ſurely, we have that creative Figure in its high Perfection; the whole Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not receive finer Colourings from the Hand of <hi>Titian;</hi> the Drapery is beautiful, and the Action in which this poetical Being is repreſented, is admirably deſcriptive of the firſt Dawnings of the Day.—</p>
                        <p>My, Dear <hi>Ranger,</hi> come, and let us criticiſe upon this Phenomenon; let us enjoy that Delight, which the Mind takes in comparing the Objects of Imitation, with the Finiſhings of mimic Art. Let me aſſure you, that to ſee this gradual Expanſion of the ſolar Influence on the Face of Nature, will give ſuch a calm Flow of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for the enſuing Vocations of the Day, as cannot be experienced in a City Life. You will poſſibly ſay, you had rather loiter in your Chambers, than endure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Rage of the Sun tending to his meridian Height. In this Caſe, <hi>Richmond-Park</hi> affords its nmbrageous Walks, where the Noontide Ray has no Acceſs. How ſweet here to loſe oneſelf in pleaſing Error, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline under an impervious Shade! and there in lettered Indolence converſe with <hi>Maro, Tully, Pope, Shakeſpear, Milton, Spencer;</hi> or with <hi>Waller</hi> cry out,
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>O! how I long my careleſs Limbs to lay</hi>

                                 <hi>Under a plantane Shade, and all the Day</hi>
                              </l>

                           </q>
                           <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0311400902:194"/>Or, if inclined to diverſify the Scene, and ramble about in gentle Exerciſe, what Place ſo fit as theſe very Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, which afford all the Variety in Nature? Do you delight in trim Hedges, uniform Viſtas, ſmooth Paſtures, and ſtudied Regularity? Your Taſte may here find enough to gratify it. Or are you rather like the Perſon of a truer Senſe of Things deſcribed by <hi>Martial, Rure vero barbaroque laetatur,</hi> one who likes true Country, rude, barbarous, and unſpoiled by the Elegancies of Art? Here you are ſuddenly ſurprized to find yourſelf upon a barren Heath, loſt to the World, and nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf to View, but the withered Shrub, and the blaſted Clump of Trees, and Hares and Rabbits run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning athwart the dreary Scene. From hence, it may be, you wander into ſome Foreſt, and hear the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at his Labour; then iſſue out upon the ploughed Land, and behold around you nothing but buſy Tokens of rural Induſtry; then, led by the Hand of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loſe yourſelf in the Solitude of the Hermitage, or wander into
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>The Thruſh-haunted Coppice, where lightly leaps</hi>

                              <l>
                                 <hi>The fearful Fawn the ruſtling Leaves along.</hi>
                              </l>
                           </q> If, at length, you are ſatisfied with this Retreat, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-Hill</hi> invites your Steps, from whence you may command a boundleſs Proſpect of all the Country round. There Villas, ſtately Buildings, Groves, Meadows, the Woodland, fertile Paſtures, Hills and Vales offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Sight in mixed Variety. The barren Heath, and the Sun-burnt craggy Soil appear with all thoſe Sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings to the Eye, which Diſtance throws upon a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape; and Nature all around appears with all her ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Majeſty and all her ſofter Graces.</p>
                        <p>To crown the Whole, at the Bottom of the Hill <hi>Thames</hi> expands his rural Stream. To purſue it in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Windings, fertilizing the Country round, is at once a Refreſhment to the Eye, and the conſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0311400902:195"/>of new Objects, takes off from that Stillneſs, which would otherwiſe overſpread the Whole. Here, my Dear <hi>Charles,</hi> we enjoy that Tranquillity of which <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks ſo feelingly; here we have Innocence, living Lakes embowering Shades, indolent Repoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath an Arbour, and the Mowing of the Cows; Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, believe me, far preferable to the <hi>Savoyard.</hi> or a City Concert. Beſides this, let me aſſure you, you will find the Muſes more coming Girls here, than in the Noiſe, and Smoke of <hi>London.</hi> But, I fear I have length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened this Letter beyond all Bounds; I can only tell you after an eminent <hi>French</hi> Writer, had I Time enough, I would make it ſhorter; but take it as it is, looſe, ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and deſultory, and believe me to be,</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0311400902:197"/>Piece may very juſtly be called a pretty Compoſition. Having laid aſide the Book, I found that the female Houſe of Commons had taken entire Poſſeſſion of my Imagination; I fancied to myſelf, to ſee my amiable Countrywomen engaged in a deep Debate; the lovely <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Tories</hi> carried on their Party-Diviſions with great Warmth and vehement Elocution; the Words <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> Intereſt, <hi>Britiſh Conſtitution, Patriotiſm, Virtue, Bribery</hi> and <hi>Corruption, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property, free uninfluenced Election, arbitrary Power,</hi> with a long <hi>Et caetera</hi> of Phraſes, were methought banded about by theſe beautiful Repreſentatives, with as much Zeal and Impetuoſity, as ever they could poſſibly have been from the Days of <hi>Hampdex</hi> down to the preſent happy Period.

The Writs being all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. I ſuppoſed the Parliament aſſembled, the Ladies in the Upper-Houſe, and the Commoners in the Lower. The Female Commons immediately proceeded to chuſe a Speaker, which was a Point of great Difficulty, every one being eager for that Office, upon a Suppoſition, that the Speaker was to have the largeſt Share of the Debate; but being undeceived in this Point, the Matter was at length adjuſted, and they then went upon Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As ſeveral Occurrences offered themſelves to my Thoughts on this Occaſion, I ſhall throw the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Part of my waking Dream, into the Form made Uſe of on theſe Occaſions.</p>

                  <p>THE Board of Criticiſm came to a Reſolution laſt Night, not to adjourn until Mr. <hi>Garrick</hi> cloſes the Theatrical Seaſon.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the laſt Meeting of our Club, of which I muſt conſider myſelf an unworthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as I have not of late attended them with proper Punctuality, my Friend Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gulliver,</hi> whom I formerly introduced to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of my Readers, produced a Paper, which he ſaid, he had brought with him from <hi>Cairo,</hi> amongſt ſeveral other Manuſcripts of the ſame Nature. After peruſing it, I judged it would make no improper En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for my Readers, and I therefore have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it a Place in this Day's Paper.</p>
                  <p>In the Days when the Empire of <hi>Bagdad</hi> ſpread Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror round the Nations, and their conquering Arms added a conſtant Acceſſion of Honour and Wealth to the Califfs, <hi>Aboulcaſem,</hi> a Youth of extenſive Parts and boundleſs Ambition, had the Addreſs to raiſe himſelf to the firſt Honours of the State, and in Proceſs of Time, he arrived to the Dignity of Vizier. In this Office his Conduct was ſuch as might be expected from a Perſon of his exalted Parts. His Renown for Genius and a bright Underſtanding diſtinguiſhed him above the Reſt of the Miniſters, and the Name of <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> was wafted on the Wings of Fame through all the Regions of the Laſt.</p>
                  <p>But amidſt all the Effulgence of his Glory, <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> was hurried away by the Violence of his Paſſions, which were rapid as the Cataracts of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as the Whirlwinds in the Deſart. His Soul was apt to kindle into a Blaze at the Sight of Beauty, and in the Height of his national Buſineſs he would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0311400902:204"/>frequently ſport away his Hours in wanton Dalliance with a <hi>Circaſſian</hi> Beauty, with whom he would often betake himſelf to the Baths, and there, in amorous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, write Letters upon Matters of the utmoſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the <hi>Califf,</hi> and the whole Empire of <hi>Bagdad,</hi> and diſpatch them to his Agents, whom he had ſent to other neighbouring Courts. At length, he was ſuſpected to favour the Cauſe of the baniſhed Prince <hi>Abdallah,</hi> who was then wandering about the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia;</hi> and though no convincing Proofs could be alledged againſt him, yet not being able to vindicate himſelf from the Imputation, he was obliged to fly his Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> immediately betook himſelf to the Prince <hi>Abdallah,</hi> and finding his Cauſe totally ruined, without any Poſſibility of re-inſtating him, he then exerted all his Induſtry to obtain Leave to return home. As Things of this Nature cannot be compaſſed in a ſhort Time, in order to hinder his Mind in the mean Time from falling a Prey to Melancholy, and all the Horrors of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Ambition, he applied himſelf to the Labours of the wiſe Men in order to relieve his Mind. Here he penned his Thoughts upon Exile, and many other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points of ſpeculative Morality. He lived like an Hermit in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and there, illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hid, he carried on his Reſearches into the Study of Nature, Hiſtory, and all the Branches of human Learning which could adorn and enrich ſo accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Mind.</p>
                  <p>Thus furniſhed with all mental Embelliſhments, <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> was in Time permitted to return, but he was not reſtored to his Honours. As Ambition is ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting, he was no ſooner fixed in his own Abode, than he inſtantly became an implacable Enemy to the Vizier, who had conſented to recal him. He drew from the Stores of Knowledge, which he had formerly treaſured up, ſome of the ſevereſt Reflections, which could be made upon the Miniſter's Adminiſtrations, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0311400902:205"/>this in ſuch a powerful Strain of nervous Eloquence, that he may very juſtly be ſaid to have had a great Share in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ownfal. <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> was ſo happy as to have accompliſhed this Buſineſs, which was for a long Time the grand Object of his Intentions; but it was no ſooner done, than he perceived himſelf as diſtant as ever from re-gaining his Prince's Ear. He therefore betook himſelf to his Country-Houſe at a ſmall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Bagdad,</hi> where he employed himſelf in reading all the Moraliſts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and in ſhort, all the fine Eaſtern Writers. In this Receſs he cultivated an Acquaintance with two of the firſt Geniuſes of his Time, <hi>Selim</hi> and <hi>Mirza;</hi> the former was remarkable among the Eaſtern Sages for elevated Strains of Poetry, and the latter for thoſe Oriental Tales, which are generally called the <hi>Tale of a Tub,</hi> and the Adventures of <hi>Gulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> the Merchant of <hi>Bagdad.</hi> Theſe two undertook the Defence of <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi>'s Character, and ſpared no Pains to blazon his Fame to the World.</p>
                  <p>Mean Time <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> purſued his Reſearches into all the Branches of human Wiſdom; the civil Polity of States was to him a Store-houſe, which diſcloſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Fund of Supply; he then turned his Eye inwards upon the Texture and Make of his own Mind; he uſed to ſay, that the Mind was a concealed Repoſitory of Riches, and that it behoved every Man to find out the Secrets of it; this accordingly he did; but he did not enjoy the ſecret, ſelfiſh Gratification of many, who, when in Poſſeſſion of a Treaſure will never let it be ſeen by human Eyes; on the contrary, he was glad to have every Opportunity of diſplaying himſelf, and this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Degree of Oſtentation; from this Branch of Study <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> proceeded to examine into Matters of Religion; the various Syſtems of the Eaſtern Sages were all to him perfectly well known; he laughed at the <hi>Keran;</hi> the Syſtem of Morality which <hi>Confucius</hi> taught, <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> held in Contempt; <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Paradiſe was
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0311400902:206"/>to him a mere <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and he declaimed with a pompous Flow of ſounding Eloquence againſt all theſe various Opinions; the <hi>Bramins</hi> were always the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his ſevereſt Contempt; in the Dictates of natural Religion, he would ſay, we have no Occaſion for ſuch Guides, and in the Explanation of eſtabliſhed Forms, they are highly dangerous; he was an Enemy to all Forms of Worſhip offered in the Temple of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; he endeavoured to ſubvert the Principles upon which this Worſhip was founded, and to introduce a new Form of Thinking of his own. Since <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> could have no Share in the Direction of State-Affairs, he was determined to ſoar above ſublunary Things, and to have the Lead in Matters of higher Importance. He was highly dogmatical in his Aſſertions, and he carried his Extravagance ſo far, as to advance, that there was no Difference between the human Species and Brutes; and that it was highly probable that Dogs and the reſt of the animal Creation were endued with Souls as well as Mankind; and in the general he aſſerted that all Souls were material.</p>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe Diſquiſitions, <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> was ſitting one Night in his Study, his Lamp burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, when of a ſudden, Thunders rolled deep and awful over his Head; the Mountains were ſhaken and they groaned; keen Lightenings flaſhed athwart the Hemiſphere; the third Heaven was opened, and a Flood of Radiance deſcended upon the Earth. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Scene appalled the Heart of <hi>Aboulcaſem;</hi> Trembling ſeized his Limbs; he fell proſtrate and adored the Meſſenger from God, who now ſtood before him, and ſpoke in Accents, which chilled the Blood within him, and made him ſtand convinced of his vain Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Aboulcaſem,</hi> ſaid he, receive my Sayings with an Ear of Attention. Know then, that the Eye of him, who is in the third Heaven hath beheld thee; he hath
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0311400902:207"/>viewed thy Ways with Compaſſion, and he hath made this Viſion a Vehicle of Inſtruction unto thy Soul, which is at preſent loſt and bewildered in a Maze of idle and fooliſh Philoſophy; for thy Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy is not calculated to advance true Knowledge, Virtue, and Wiſdom, but has its Source in Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Oſtentation and Vain-glory have induced thee to diſplay thy imagined Superiority of Parts, which pretends to pervade all Syſtems of Religion, and thy Heart's Conceit will approve of none. Thy Studies are ill directed, and their Driſt is only to alienate the Minds of Men from any ſettled Form of Worſhip, which you are in the Wrong to diſturb, as your own Inſufficiency cannot ſubſtitute a better than what is deſigned to keep Society in a due Senſe of Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Supreme Being, and to preſerve the Bands of civil Compact religiouſly unbroken. Caſt but thine Eye upon yonder Vale; behold what is there tranſacted. There thou may'ſt ſee Men diveſted of all Forms of Worſhip, and rendered perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thy vain Notions of Religion. There thou may'ſt ſee what is the State of Man ungoverned by ſettled Forms of Devotion; they have ſhaken off all Regard to the Prophet, and behold them immerſed in all Manner of vicious Practices. Uncontrouled they invade each other's Rights; they make War to gratify their Ambition; freely without Reſtraint they proſcribe whom they pleaſe; the Bonds of Society are broken, and the Contempt of divine Laws has introduced a Contempt for all human Inſtitutions. To promote this Scene of Confuſion are thy Writings calculated, but know, and dread the Truth I am now to utter, that it will better behove thee to pay Submiſſion to the eſtabliſhed Forms of Worſhip of thy Country, than to diſturb the Peace of the Faithful, and thereby fill their Minds with Doubt, with Jealouſy,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0311400902:208"/>Miſtruſt, Suſpicion, and all the Horrors of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening Imagination.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At theſe Words the Radiance, which ſpoke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from his Eyes, and left <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> in the utmoſt Conſternation; the Impreſſion was, however, very ſoon effaced; for notwithſtanding this Admonition, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in his ill Deſigns; but the Thread of his Days was cut ſhort before he could vent them abroad into the World. However, his Intentions were not totally fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, for the Hand of Death had no ſooner ſmote him, than his Compoſitions fell into the Hands of <hi>Namahran,</hi> another Eaſtern Writer, who ſold them for a certain Number of Sequins of Gold, and by thoſe Means the Writings of <hi>Aboulcaſem</hi> came into every Body's Hands, and ſpread their baneful Influence on the Minds of all the Inhabitants of <hi>Bagdad.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE gloomy Month of <hi>November</hi> is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by Foreigners, as the Heighth of the Seaſon for <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to hang and drown themſelves; but from a diligent Obſervation I can venture to affirm, that the Month of <hi>May</hi> is always attended with a larger Bill of Mortality than any other Part of the Year. It is the Spring-Time of Love, when the Blood has received a Renovation of Warmth, and young Minds are then more eaſily melted down in the amorous Fire. A Bookſeller, whom I now and then chat with at his <hi>Circulating Library,</hi> informs me, that he can tell when the Poiſon of Love begins to rankle in the Breaſt, that he can trace it in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and knows exactly when it is become quite ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in its Influence. Romances, he ſays, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning are more and more call'd for; as it encreaſes, Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s Love Letters, the Loves of <hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Philander, Abelard</hi> and <hi>Eloiſe,</hi> Letters from a <hi>Nun to a Cavalier,</hi> &amp;c. come into Play; and when the Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grown Epidemic, then the Tragedies of <hi>Romeo and Juliet, All for Love, or the World well loſt,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0311400902:210"/>Theodoſius or the Force of Love,</hi> &amp;c, cannot be ſupplied quick enough to anſwer the wonderful Demand for them. My ingenious Friend will ſometimes take me into his back Room, and "Friend <hi>Ranger,</hi>" ſays he, <q>can't you touch us up ſome ſecret Memoirs, or a Love-Tale, or ſomething by Way of Novel—If green Peas come in faſt—the Seaſon for Peas is always favourable to love-ſick Minds—I can manage to put you off— let me ſee—ay, about a couple of thouſand by Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer—yes, thereabouts—I could get—if you will put your Name to it,—a matter of fifteen hundred ſubſcribed among the Trade—how will you make it end?—happy or unhappy?—for there will be a Difference in that—but, that muſt be determined by the Chapter of Accidents—a North-Eaſt Wind chills the amorous Heat—in that Caſe, you had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make them die—but, if the ſouthern Gale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, they may in the Concluſion be <hi>conducted by the laughing Loves to the nuptial Bower</hi>—the Book will ſoon be in every Body's Hands, at <hi>Tunbridge, Bath, Scarborough, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is this ſkilful Perſon in his Trade for taking Advantage of that Succeſſion of Foibles, which are conſtantly riſing and falling in the moſt whimſical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude in this Metropolis. The Truth of it is the Play-houſes, the Circulating Libraries, the public Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens about Town owe very much of their Succeſs to the love-ſick Minds of Boys and Girls. It is this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Paſſion which rolls ſo many of the Youth of both Sexes down the ſoft Declivity in <hi>Greenwich-Park;</hi> it is this which is ſo fond of taking cold at the Tin Caſcade in <hi>Vaux-hall</hi> Gardens, and it is this which pours forth ſo many Groupes of Enamoratos along the Fields and Meadows about <hi>London</hi> every <hi>Sunday</hi> Evening.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the extenſive Influence of this ſoft Infection, it is ſomewhat ſurprizing that among all the Writers, who have endeavoured to deſcribe it, very few
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0311400902:211"/>of them have ſucceeded in any tolerable Degree. What Numbers of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tragedies have been ſunk into an inſipid Languor by the ineffectual Whim of Epiſodic Love? The Tragedy of <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet,</hi> excepting now and then ſome glittering Conceits, which we may ſuppoſe to be Transfuſions from the <hi>Italian Novelliſt,</hi> who furniſhed <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> with the Story, affords a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Repreſentation of two young Minds touched with this tender Sympathy. Many of the Tragedies of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> though they are now too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, diſplay the delicate Senſations of Love, in all their native genuine Simplicity. I am not clear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fine Interchange of Sentiments between <hi>Jaffier</hi> and <hi>Belvidera</hi> ſhould come within the Precincts of Love; becauſe the Deſire of Poſſeſſion, which fires the tender Imagination into a gentle Enthuſiaſm, has then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided into a ſympathetic Friendſhip between Man and Wife; and accordingly the moſt pathetic Touches are derived, not from the Lover's fond Hope of mutual Bliſs to come, but from a Retroſpect to thoſe vaniſhed Hours, when <hi>Jaffier</hi> lay for three whole happy Years in his <hi>Belvidera</hi>'s Arms; and thus the Tranſition from their former Endearments to their preſent Miſery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites thoſe intenſe Emotions of Pity for their Fate. Perhaps, after the Writers juſt mentioned, the Tragedy of <hi>Tancred</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmunda,</hi> has the faireſt Claim to any Degree of Reputation; in this Piece the Love of the young Prince is manly, and never dwindles into childiſh Conceit; the Feelings of <hi>Sigiſmunda</hi> are delicate and ſenſible, and through all the Scenes the Softneſs of their Paſſion is ennobled by Sentiments of Honour and moral Dignity. But, among all the Books, which the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of both Sexes are apt to call for at this Seaſon of the Year, there is none which can exhibit ſo lively a Picture of Love, as the Fourth Book of <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Virgil,</hi> which I would recommend to my young Readers, not by Way of adding Fuel to the Fire, but to warn them
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0311400902:212"/>of the Dangers of the growing Flame; as they will here perceive all the Viciſſitudes of the Paſſion, till at length it terminates in a melancholy Cataſtrophe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Paper with an Extract from an unpubliſhed Pamphlet, written by an ingenious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has given me Leave to make my own uſe of it. It is called the Hiſtory of <hi>Roſamond</hi>'s <hi>Pond for the Month of May,</hi> and, though ſome of the Incidents are not the Effects of Love, it will, however, ſhew many of the Diſaſters that attend that ſweet, but dangerous Senſation.</p>

                  <p>An Act to prevent a conſtant Repetition of the ſame worn-out Tragedies throughout every Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>An Act to oblige every capital Actor to bring at leaſt TWO new Parts into the Stock every Winter, by Way of ſhewing how he paſſed his Time, in his Receſs from Buſineſs during the Summer, and to ſeveral public and private Bills.

My Hopes of ſucceeding in this Requeſt are the more ſanguine, as the intellectual Scene, of which I mean here to give ſome Account, was occaſioned by a Peruſal of a Viſion of your own, in which you deſcribe a <hi>Sacrifice to the Graces.</hi>

                        <p>The Images, which that Piece excited in my Fancy, incorporated, if I may ſo call it, with the Ideas, that have been uppermoſt in my waking Thoughts for ſome Time paſt, and I imagined in my Sleep that there was a general Election in <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> for proper Members to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0311400902:216"/>the Republic of Letters. It ſeems, <hi>Apollo</hi> was induced by frequent Murmurs and Complaints to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his Parliament; ſome Malcontents among the Moderns, being of Opinion, that the Antients had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily voted themſelves perpetual Dictators in Wit; whereas, upon a free uninfluenced, Election, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved themſelves capable of returning a larger Number than the ſaid Antients. The Party for the Moderns was led on by Monſieur <hi>De la Motte, Perrault</hi> and <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> the two former were vigorouſly oppoſed by <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau,</hi> Madam <hi>Dacier,</hi> and the latter by Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> and Doctor <hi>Swift. Swift</hi> ordered a new Edition of his Battle of the Books to be publiſhed forthwith, and <hi>Pope</hi> took occaſion to reprint his Eſſays, and Criticiſms upon <hi>Homer.</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Intereſt</hi> were the Words by which each Party ſignified their Attachments, and Reams of <hi>Lampoons, Acroſtics,</hi> and <hi>Rebuſſes</hi> were iſſued out by the Moderns, which were all anſwered by Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, Fables, and Burleſque Pieces written by the Friends of the Antients.</p>
                        <p>At length the Writs were iſſued out to the proper Officers to chuſe Repreſentatives for the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Borough-Towns in <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> ſome Places, by poetic Licence, having Leave to return as many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as could fairly prove a Qualification. <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> were declared for epic Poetry; <hi>Milton</hi> was ſet up by the Encouragement of ſeveral Friends, and they were all three accordingly choſen. <hi>Homer</hi> had four and twenty upon the Poll, and <hi>Virgil</hi> twelve; <hi>Milton,</hi> by an Aſſeſſment a little before the Election, created two new Votes, by which he alſo reached the Number twelve, and <hi>Virgil</hi> was ſo modeſt that he made no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it. <hi>Taſſo,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore,</hi> were declared Candidates, but the former was proved to have bribed with <hi>clinquant,</hi> and the latter could not make out a Qualification.</p>

                           <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0311400902:217"/>In the Regions of Tragedy, <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> joined Intereſts, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> undertook to canvaſs for them; but <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> carried it by a great Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; <hi>Corneille</hi> and <hi>Racine</hi> ſtood next upon the Liſt, but a Scrutiny was demanded in Favour of the <hi>Old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> upon a Suſpicion that ſeveral <hi>Copy-holders</hi> had polled for the Moderns, and the <hi>New-Intereſt</hi> employed ſome <hi>French</hi> Critics to go through their Anſwer; it was thought it will at laſt end in a double Return; and it was further ſaid, that <hi>Otway</hi> and <hi>Row</hi> would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared duly elected. <hi>Dryden</hi> and <hi>Lee</hi> joined Intereſts, and though many gay and flighty Perſons were very warm in their Cauſe, their Schemes were looked upon by the cool and judicious, as rather too wild and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic. The <hi>French</hi> Critics threatened, that at ſome future Election, they ſhould be able to make more Members, being reſolved to put up <hi>Crebillon</hi> and <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire</hi> even againſt <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> to which end, ſeveral Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt the laſt mentioned Genius were already drawn up by <hi>Voltaire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the comic Territories the Antients loſt their Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a very great Majority; <hi>Moliere, Ben Johnſon, Congreve</hi> and <hi>Vanburgh,</hi> being declared duly elected. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> was made an honourary Member for this Quarter, and was univerſally allowed to be a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of both Places. <hi>Dryden</hi> found Means, by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Friar, to inſinuate himſelf into this Place, and it was given out, that when <hi>Colley Cibber</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives here, he will be put up as a Perſon duly qualified, though it is apprehended that his Quarrel with <hi>Pope</hi> has deprived him of ſeveral Votes.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>New Intereſt</hi> exulted greatly upon their Conqueſt in the laſt Election, and in order to compleat their Triumph, proceed further into the Regions of <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Ridicule. Homer</hi> was here again put up by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who urged the <hi>Margites</hi> as a ſufficient Claim; but the Writings of that Eſtate being loſt, he was obliged to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0311400902:218"/>decline the Poll. After this, an Advertiſement was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, deſiring the Votes and Intereſt of all the true Sons of Merriment for <hi>Ariſtophanes, Menander, Plautus,</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> who had juſt loſt their Election in another Place; <hi>Lucian</hi> ſet up upon his own Intereſt. The <hi>Moderns</hi> declared <hi>Cervantes, Rablais, Swift</hi> and <hi>Butler</hi> joint Candidates, being all Gentlemen heartily attached to true Wit and Humour. Votes were alſo ſollicited for ſeveral other Perſonages; Monſieur <hi>la Sage, Scarroon, Marivaux,</hi> and <hi>Addiſon</hi> were ſtrongly recommended; but the latter being returned in Conjunction with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>la Sage</hi> for the Borough of POLITE-MIRTH, Sir <hi>Richard Steel</hi> appeared on the Huſtings, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his Friend's Name. <hi>Swift</hi> mixed with the lower Sort of People; joked with the Women about their Dreſſing-rooms, and republiſhed his Account of the ſtrange Man juſt arrived in Town. <hi>Rablais</hi> contributed a good deal to the general Mirth; <hi>Cervantes</hi> occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gave vent to a Vein of low Humour, but <hi>Lucian</hi> could not make himſelf univerſally underſtood, and many of his Turns did not allude to modern-practiſed Life. <hi>Scarroon</hi> got together a Company of Strollers, and exhibited Entertainments in Booths with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. <hi>Ward, Concanon,</hi> and <hi>Tom Brown</hi> offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on this Occaſion, but were rejected with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. At length the Books were cloſed, and <hi>Lucian Cervantes, Butler,</hi> and <hi>Swift</hi> were declared duly elected. At which the Managers for the <hi>New Intereſt</hi> were highly inſtamed; they lodged a Petition in Favour of <hi>Rablais,</hi> but ſuch a Vein of Extravagance run through the Whole, and ſome Paſſages were worked up into ſuch a Strain of unintelligible Frolic, that it was generally ſuppoſed it would be given againſt him. However, his Friends were determined to bring him in for an inferior Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and <hi>Scarron</hi> and <hi>Marivaux</hi> were alſo aſſured of their Election. Whenever <hi>Fielding</hi> ſhall arrive to his
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0311400902:219"/>Eſtate in this Part of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> there is a Borough ready to elect him.</p>
                        <p>To have ſo many Moderns choſen for the laſt Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was highly agreeable to the <hi>New Intereſt;</hi> they were however a good Deal dejected at the Election for <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> for which the Conteſt was ineffectual. <hi>Thyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, Salluſt, Livy,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> being choſen by a great Majority. <hi>Faminianus Strada</hi> endeavoured to hurt the Election of the laſt mentioned Writer, in order, as it was thought, to ſubſtitute himſelf; but <hi>Peers</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to appear at Elections in <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> Lord <hi>Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> gave all his Intereſt to <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and aſſured him that his Works were of infinite Uſe in all his political Tracts. <hi>Salluſt</hi> recommended St. <hi>Real,</hi> an approved <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian, to a Borough. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was put up without his Conſent, a literary Fame not being the Object of his Ambition; Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> was for a long Time decried by a Party, but was at laſt declared duly elected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> harangued from the Huſtings, and were unanimouſly choſen for <hi>Oratory;</hi> and it was thought that ſome who have made a conſpicuous Figure in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliaments, would be admitted to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Seat with thoſe immortal Geniuſſes. A Party of <hi>Frenchmen</hi> endeavoured to make a Stand, upon the Strength of ſome certain Funeral Orations, but in a few Hours they found themſelves greatly out-polled.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Horace, Boileau, Dryden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> were made the Repreſentatives of <hi>Satyr; Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Perſeus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet up for Places upon their own ſeparate Intereſts; as ſoon as the Election was over Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> thanked the Conſtituents for the Honour conferred upon him, and ſignified his Inclination to take his Seat for <hi>Ethics,</hi> to which he was reeommended by the Lord Viſcount <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingbroke,</hi> and the Voters came to a Reſolution to fill up the Vacancy by putting up the famous Doctor <hi>Young,</hi> though in his Abſence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0311400902:220"/>Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> were returned for real and uſeful Philoſophy, at which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was violently curaged. He was, however, ſomewhat comforted to find himſelf the firſt on the Poll for <hi>Criticiſm; Longinus, Quintilian,</hi> and <hi>Bobours</hi> were alſo declared duly elected. There was a great Number of Boroughs in this County, moſt of which were repſeſented by <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> the Chief of whom was the <hi>Abbé du Bos,</hi> Author of the Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon Poeſy and Painting. Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was alſo returned in this Diſtrict, but being previouſly choſen, he thanked the Voters in general, and told them they would not be at a Loſs for a proper Repreſentative for that Place, whenever the Author of the <hi>Polymetis</hi> ſhould be willing to ſtand the Poll.</p>
                        <p>In the Regions of miſcellaneous Poetry <hi>Dryden</hi> had an Offer from almoſt every Place; <hi>Spencer</hi> was elected for a Borough, ſaid to be over-run with Witches and Fairies; in <hi>Paſtoral, Ambroſe Phillips</hi> exerted his utmoſt Intereſt; but it was ſaid that Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> though he did not chuſe to be the Repreſentative himſelf, had reſolved to hinder <hi>Philips</hi> from coming in. <hi>Virgil</hi> thanked the Country People for the Offers made to himſelf, expatiated on raral Happineſs, and ſaid he ſhould always be a Lover of <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Rivers;</hi> but begged Leave to recommend in his room <hi>Vaniere,</hi> Writer of the <hi>Praedium Ruſticum,</hi> and the late Mr. <hi>James Thompſon</hi> Author of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aeſop.

                     <p>Yeſterday at a Board of PRIGGISM held here, it was pretty warmly debated between <hi>Jemmy Spindle</hi> and <hi>Jack Dupe, whether a Gentleman acquires more Honour by whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than by gaming?</hi> When Mr. <hi>Spindle</hi> begg'd Leave to ſay, that the little Reputation he held in the World was entirely owing to his appearing every Night, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Winter Seaſon, between two Girls in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony—here Mr. <hi>Dupe</hi> interrupted him, and obſerved, that undoubtedly whoring was eſſentially neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eſtabliſhing the Character of a Man of Spirit; but that in his Opinion, gaming ſhewed more the Man
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0311400902:222"/>of Conſequence; for, ſays he, the firſt Men in the Kingdom are Gameſters, and—here <hi>Harry Edging</hi> cried out, <hi>d—n me, there's a pretty Girl going by,</hi> upon which the Board was broke up, and the Point left undecided, to the great Diſappointment of <hi>Jerry,</hi> who was all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and waited the Event of the Diſpute, with open Mouth, which plainly ſhews an eager Appetite for Knowledge.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Friend, Mr. <hi>Candid,</hi> deſires that he may diſcharge his Promiſe to give ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animadverſions on the Tragedy of King <hi>Lear;</hi> as he has run into a long Eſſay, I ſhall reſign to him the entire Paper of this Day.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding what is ingeniouſly urged by the Gentleman, who obliged me with a Letter upon my former Criticiſm of King <hi>Lear,</hi> I cannot, after a Review of that Tragedy, find any Reaſon to retract my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the aged Monarch's Madneſs is occaſioned by the Ingratitude of his Daughters. The Folly of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents putting himſelf in the Power of his Children, muſt incidentally appear in a Play, founded on ſuch a Story as that of <hi>Lear;</hi> but, had thoſe Children not proved ungrateful, I apprehend there is no Reaſon to imagine, the King's Mind would have taken the fatal Turn it did. But the beſt Way of knowing, with any Degree of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the ſecret Cauſes of thoſe Effects, which diſcloſe themſelves in ſundry Appearances in human Life, is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0311400902:223"/>by gaining an Inſight into the private Tempers of Men. <hi>Lean</hi> conſidered in this Manner, ſoon diſcovers to us the latent Seeds, which are likely to kindle into a Blaze, upon the Revolt of his Daughters. The Impreſſion which <hi>Cordelia</hi>'s artleſs Anſwer had upon him is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by himſelf.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>—O moſt ſmall Fault,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>How ugly didſt thou in</hi> Cordelia <hi>ſhew,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Which, like an Engine, wrench'd my Frame of Nature</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>From theſe a Place; drew from my Heart all Love,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>And added to the Gail—</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> This plainly evinces where the old Man's Paſſions were moſt acceſſible, and how ſtrong the Workings of them were likely to be, when he ſhould find a total Diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: No wonder if then his Frame of Nature is wrench'd from the fix'd Place, and indeed, his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that Way ſoon diſcovers itſelf, when he breaks out into theſe Words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>I will forget my Nature;—ſo</hi> KIND <hi>a Father!</hi>—</q>
                  <p>Were the Loſs of Royalty uppermeſt in his Thoughts, his Remarks would moſt aſſuredly take their Tincture from thence, and he would rather blame himſelf as a WEAK <hi>Father,</hi> who had given all to his Children. But the Circumſtance of his having given all, is never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, unleſs it is to aggravate the Ill-uſage he has met with, and when he ſays to himſelf, <hi>To take't again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,</hi> it is plain, that it is not merely for the ſake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining loſt Grandeur, but to avenge his Wrongs; and he immediately ſubjoins, <hi>Monſter Ingratitude!</hi>—and a little after, <hi>let me not be mad; not mad, ſweet Heaven!</hi> —The hool, indeed, taunts him with the Folly of his having diveſted himſelf of his Power, and put the Rod, as he calls it, in his Childrens Hand. Theſe Ideas are ſo obvious, that <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> knew they would ſtrike even the moſt ſuperficial Mind; but we find it is no Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0311400902:224"/>with the Father, who never dwells upon it, though it is ſuggeſted to him ſo frequently. On the other Hand, how acute are his Feelings, whenever he recurs to his Daughters want of filial Piety! He that can read the following Lines, without being ſoftened into Tears, muſt, as Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> has ſaid upon another Occaſion, have either a very good, or a very bad Head.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—<hi>Oh!</hi> Regan, <hi>ſhe has tied</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Sharp-tooth'd</hi> UNKINDNESS <hi>like a</hi> VULTURE <hi>here</hi>—</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>—I ſcarce can ſpeak to thee—thoul't not believe</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>With how depraved a Quality—Oh!</hi> Regan!—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>What a Picture of a Mind have we here?—The Strugglings with his Sorrows, the Breaks of Paſſion, the Attempt to ſpeak, and the inſtant Suppreſſion of his Powers, are the moſt natural and pathetic Touches. Can the human Imagination, in all her Treaſury of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, find Words to expreſs at once the deteſtable Crime of Diſobedience to our Parents, and the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Feelings of an injured Father, like the following Paſſage?</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>—She has ſtruck me with her Tongue</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Moſt Serpent like upon the very Heart!</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Who is there, that does not inſtantaneouſly find himſelf in a Guſh of Tears on reading theſe Lines? And more particularly, when, a little afterwards, he comes to the Speech which cloſes with,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>—You think I'll weep;—</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>No, I'll not weep—tho' I have full Cauſe of weeping—</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>—This Heart ſhall break into a thouſand Flaws</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Or e'er I'll weep—O Fool, I ſhall go mad—</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> The laſt Touch in this Speech, is the fineſt cloſe of a Climax of Paſſion that can be conceived; and even then the old Monarch feels that his <hi>Wits begin to turn,</hi> for which melancholy Situation, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> all along
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0311400902:225"/>finely prepares us, by ſkilfully marking each Step the Mind takes, in all its Workings, towards that ſettled State of Grief.</p>
                  <p>I have dwell'd thus long on the Cauſe of <hi>Lear</hi>'s Diſtraction, becauſe the Arguments, offered by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Correſpondent in the Eſſay of the 19th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> carry ſome Degree of Plauſibility; but from what has been premiſed, together with what I have urged in my former Paper, there cannot, I think, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any Doubt about it. Thoſe that are not ſatisfied with this reaſoning are referred to the nobleſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary this, or any Poet ever had; I mean Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>'s Performance of <hi>Lear,</hi> in which there is diſplayed ſo juſt a Knowledge of the human Mind under a State of Madneſs, together with ſuch exquiſite Feelings of the various Shiftings of the Paſſions, ſo finely at the ſame Time enſeebled with the Debility of Age, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, whenever this admirable Actor ceaſes to play this Part, the unhappy Monarch will loſe more than <hi>fifty of his Followers at a Clap.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Though our great Poet pays us very amply for all his Tranſgreſſions againſt the Laws of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> yet, I have frequently wiſhed, that the noble Wildneſs of his Genius had not rendered him ſo unbounded in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Had this Tragedy been planned with more Art, without an underplot to draw off our Affections from the principal Object, it had been a Piece for all the united Efforts of <hi>Greece</hi> to envy. However, the Epiſode, in which the <hi>Baſtard</hi> is acting the ſame unnatural Part as <hi>Lear</hi>'s legitimate Daughters, is not entirely detached from the main Subject; the Misfortunes of the good old <hi>Gloſter,</hi> who endeavours to aſſiſt the forlorn King, muſt touch every Breaſt, and the Character of <hi>Edgar</hi> muſt appear amiable in every Eye.</p>
                  <p>The cloſe of this Tragedy is full of Terror and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, and our great Foet has here given us a Death, which is not often to be found in the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0311400902:226"/>Bill of Mortality, <hi>viz.</hi> the Death of <hi>Lear</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Dagger, or the Bowl. But, perhaps, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the Heart-piercing Senſations, which we have before endured through the whole Piece, it would be too much to ſee this actually performed on the Stage; from the Actor whom I have already named, I am ſure it would; though, I ſhould be glad to ſee the Experiment made, convinced at the ſame Time that the Play, as it is altered, will always be moſt agreeable to an Audience, as the Circumſtances of <hi>Lear</hi>'s Reſtoration, and the virtuous <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Alliance with the amiable <hi>Cordelia,</hi> muſt always call forth thoſe guſhing Tears, which are ſwelled and enobled by a virtuous Joy. The Alteration is juſtified by another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is, that <hi>Lear</hi> was really reſtored to his Crown, if we may believe <hi>Spencer,</hi> who gives the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Narrative, with which I ſhall cloſe this Paper, making no Doubt, but it will afford great Entertainment to the Reader who has not before amuſed himſelf with the Compariſon, to ſee <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Story related by ſo great a Poet as <hi>Spencer,</hi> in his tenth Canto of the <hi>Fairy-Queen.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN <hi>Turnus,</hi> in the tenth <hi>Aeneid,</hi> is buſied in Fields of Slaughter and Devaſtation, an interpoſing Goddeſs ſhadows forth an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Appearance of the adverſe Warrior, arms the Phantom with an air-drawn Javelin, gives an imaginary Shield and Creſt, adds a mimic Voice, and Sounds innocent of Thought, and then makes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Mockery ſly before the Ranks, in order to divert the real Combatant, and engage him in a vain Purſuit. The Impoſition takes Effect, and the General is ſeduced from the Field, when the fugitive Illuſion vaniſhes into Air, and then too late the Hero perceives, that he had
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0311400902:229"/>quitted the Field of Glory, and the neceſſary Duties of his Calling, to diſtinguiſh his martial Proweſs againſt a fictitious Enemy, where no Honour could be reaped. In the Warfare of the Pen, ſomething like this very commonly happens, and a Writer is no ſooner obſerved to be engaged in a right Courſe, but a counterfeit Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius is inſtantly ſet up in Oppoſition to him. Mother <hi>Dullneſs,</hi> who is always as careful of her Favourites as any Goddeſs in epic Poetry, is ſure to make ſomething appear in the Shape of a Writer; ſhe arms him with a Gooſe-Quill, furniſhes Ink and Paper, ſupplies him with empty Words, and unideal Sounds, without any thinking Faculty. <hi>Dat inania verba, dat ſine mente ſonum.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>I have ever looked upon the warlike Hero, in the former Inſtance, to be in a very ridiculous Situation, and ſurely the Author, who can quit the Purſuit of nobler Game, to follow an idle Scribler in the Form of a Pamphlet, a Letter to a Friend, an unmuſe-like Poem, or a pointleſs Epigram, muſt, in the Eyes of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, appear to act unworthily, and very much beneath himſelf. On this Account it is, that <hi>Ranger</hi> has hitherto kept himſelf clear of all Diſputes with his Brethren of the Quill, and has inceſſantly purſued his Plan, though there have not been wanting Things, <q>that would be Poets thought,</q> who have endeavoured to moleſt him in his Career.</p>
                  <p>But deaf to all ſuch Avocations, I have attended only to the Proſecution of the Deſign this Paper firſt ſet out with, <hi>viz</hi> to conduce my utmoſt to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Inſtruction of my Readers. The former of theſe Views, I flatter myſelf, has in ſome Degree ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and with Regard to the latter, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have enlightened the Underſtandings of all my Cotemporaries, nor to have brought about a general Reformation of Men and Manners. The Truth of it is, I cannot conſider the <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn Journal,</hi> as a general
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0311400902:230"/>
                     <hi>Panacea</hi> for the Defects of Mankind, though my Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller and many of my other Friends <hi>(i. e.</hi> Enemies) have been pleaſed to compliment me on that Score. When I declare thus much, I beg, I may not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to envy the Fame of a very elegant and ingenious Brother-Writer, who very pleaſantly congratulates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the extenſive Amendment of Mankind ſince the Commencement of his Paper, and aſſures us, that there is no ſuch Thing at preſent as Cards at <hi>White</hi>'s, or naked Shoulders at <hi>Ranelagh;</hi> and from the general Ceſſation of Vice, conceives the <hi>Millennium</hi> to be at Hand; at which happy Period he is determined to lay down his Pen.</p>
                  <p>For my Part, I ſhall not wait for the <hi>Milennium;</hi> for I muſt own, I have met with very different Succeſs in my Diſtrict, and therefore I am reſolved not to cry out, in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Falſtaff</hi> to the vanquiſhed <hi>Hotſpur,</hi> 
                     <q>there lies Vice; an the King will reward me;—ſo;—if not,—let him write the next Paper himſelf.</q> So far from having any Title to this Boaſt, I have at preſent only one Letter by me, teſtifying the ſurprizing Cure wrought by my Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubrations, which is as follows.</p>

Tho' the Diction of the <hi>Romans</hi> is likely to endure as long as Time ſhall ſubſiſt; yet we find that <hi>Horace,</hi> in the Words of my Motto, is aware of the Decay of Words and Phraſes, which die away, and are conſtantly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a ſudden Birth of new Terms and Modes of Phraſeology. In ſeveral other Paſſages of his Writings, there are ſhort Reflections upon this literary Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon, in which he always delivers himſelf with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Regret. They fall, ſays he, like Leaves, and are replaced by a new Product; like young Perſons, they flouriſh for a ſhort Time, and then tend to Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion. The Compariſon is moſt certainly very juſt; and as young Men in their Bloom and Vigour are ſaid to be <hi>upon Town,</hi> it is the ſame with Words; they are alſo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0311400902:235"/>
                           <hi>upon Town</hi> for a Time, and then totally periſh. I have often thought, that a <hi>weekly Bill</hi> of Words would not be unentertaining to Men of Letters, and if there was a proper Regiſter Office for the Purpoſe, where their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Births and Burials might be recorded with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and Preciſion, I ſhould imagine it would furniſh no diſagreeable Hiſtory. A Diſtinction might be made between a Kind of Sex in Words, according as they are appropriated to Men or Women; as for Inſtance, <hi>D—n my Blood</hi> is of male Extraction, and <hi>Pſhaw, Fiddleſtick,</hi> I take to be female. Upon this Plan the weekly Bill might ſtand in this Form.</p>

                        <p>If, for the Satisfaction on of the curious, a Liſt ſhould be furniſhed of the ſeveral Terms that are born, or that die away, with a ſhort Account of the Life and Character of each Phraſe, whether it be born of honeſt Parents in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> what Company it kept, whether it was Whig or Tory, Popiſh or Proteſtant, it would in my Opinion be an agreeable Addition to this verbal Hiſtory. There might further be added an Account of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as might happen to be naturalized, with the Objections of the Learned, who ſhould think proper to proteſt againſt ſuch a Naturalization of Foreigners among the Natives of this Land. Such a Procedure could not fail to yield Satisfaction to the curious; and, though it would not prevent the Inſtability of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it would at leaſt diſplay the gradual Steps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Improvement or final Deſtruction. For my Part, I have ever looked upon the Permanency of our Language to be of greater Conſequence than the Stocks, of whatever Denomination, and for that Reaſon, I ſhould be glad that ſome Mcans were deviſed to hinder
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0311400902:236"/>the Diction of our <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> from being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated, and to ſuſpend the Evils, which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> threatens us with, when he ſays

                        <p>The Dictionary, which the Erudition of Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> is preparing for the Public, may in ſome Meaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this End, and, in Aid to that Deſign I have been for ſome Time paſt planning a Dictionary of ſuch Words, as appeared to me from a Concurrence of various Cauſes, to be moſt likely to be totally forgot. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to forward this Undertaking, I have annexed a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the Work, not as yet reduced into alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Order, but drawn out in ſuch a Manner as may ſerve to convey ſome Idea of the intended Work. When the Whole is compleated it may ſerve as a proper Companion to the <hi>Spectator,</hi> the <hi>Tatler,</hi> and all the Works of Morality, which have been publiſhed in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and it may be contributing to make our Poſterity have ſome faint Notion of what is meant in many Places, when the viſible Tendency of our Manners to an entire Change from antient Simplicity has almoſt effaced the Ideas, which the Author of the Times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to expreſs.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>A</hi> Specimen <hi>of an</hi> Engliſh Dictionary.</q>
                        <p>CREATURE, A Term to ſhew our Contempt of any Perſon whom we diſlike, chiefly uſed by the Ladies.</p>
                        <p>THING, Very often uſed to imply our Diſlike, but chiefly uſed to ſignify our higheſt Approbation. Thus it is ſaid of a fine Lady; "She's the very Thing," or of a young Fellow, "O, Ma'em, he's the very Thing;" and ſometimes with Limitation, as, <q>yes, very well, but not the Thing.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>PATRIOT, A Man who ſpeaks againſt the Court till he gets a Place or Penſion.</p>
                        <p>HONEST, This Term is derived from the <hi>Latin</hi> Word <hi>Honeſtum,</hi> which among the <hi>Romans</hi> implied every
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0311400902:237"/>Thing that is honourable in a Character. From thence <hi>Pope</hi> was induced to ſay,
<q>
                              <hi>An honeſt Man's the nobleſt Work of God.</hi>
                           </q> This is the original Meaning of the Word; in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential Senſe it is ſtrangely altered. <hi>Honeſt</hi> now ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Gaming, Drinking, and Debauchery of every Sort; it being common to ſay of a Man who is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to all theſe faſhionable Vices, that he's an <q>
                              <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Fellow.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>GOOD-NATURE, an old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word uſed by our Anceſtors; it is plain, that it carried with it ſome Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Cuſtoms and Manners of thoſe Times, but there is no tracing it to its Source.</p>
                        <p>RELIGION, an old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word for the Worſhip of a Supreme Being, and the Practice of ſocial Duties to our Neighbours; probably a Cuſtom known to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Druids.</p>
                        <p>HUMBUG, A Lye.</p>
                        <p>WORTH, originally it meant laudable Qualities of the Mind; at preſent tis ſolely confined to a Man's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: Thus a Scoundrel of fifty Thouſand is a Man of <hi>Worth,</hi> and an honeſt Man in Indigence is <hi>worth</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                        <p>PARTY, ſormerly ſignified Diviſions in the State, at preſent it means a Jaunt to <hi>Vaux-hall, Bedlam, Church,</hi> or any Place of Diverſion.</p>
                        <p>TRAGEDY, a Name by which <hi>Shakeſpear, Otway,</hi> and ſome others entitled their dramatic Writings; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns retain the Word, but have totally loſt the original Senſe of it.</p>
                        <p>COMEDY, probably a Piece in which our rude An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors repreſented the Follies and Characters of the Age; nothing of this Sort is at preſent known amongſt us.</p>
                        <p>DAMNED, when Prieſtcraft prevailed in this Country, the People were frightened with ſtrange Ideas of <hi>Hell,</hi>
                           <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0311400902:238"/>or a Place of Torture, where the departed Spirits of bad Men were ſuppoſed to be confined. At preſent it ſignifies the higheſt Praiſe we can confer. Thus we ſay, <q>A damned fine Woman; a damned charming Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a damned fine Fellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>DRUM, an Inſtrument of warlike Muſic uſed at the March of an Army, or in Time of Battle to animate the Soldiery: Hence ſtiled by <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> the <hi>Spirit ſtirring Drum.</hi> It has not been uſed to any Purpoſe by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſince the Days of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough.</hi> In its metaphorical Senſe it means a Party of Cards, <hi>(Vide Rout.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FRIENDSHIP, an old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word uſed by our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors to ſignify the complex Idea of Affection and Eſteem between two or more Perſons, founded upon a virtuous Sympathy of Tempers, and congenial Habits of Virtue (<hi>for the Meaning of the Word</hi> VIRTUE, <hi>ſee in its reſpective Place:)</hi> This Cuſtom was totally baniſhed in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and few or no Traces of it have been diſcovered ever ſince.</p>
                        <p>GOD, The antient <hi>Druids,</hi> it is probable from all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians imagined that a ſuperior Being ſuper-intended the Direction of the Univerſe, and the Term GOD, it is not unlikely, originally fignified this ſuperior Being; but ſince it has been happily found out, that every Thing was made by <hi>Chance,</hi> or that <hi>Nature, (Vide</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>in its proper Place)</hi> produced every Thing we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and ſince the Properties of Matter have been ſufficiently detected by Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and others, the Term <hi>God</hi> is totally exploded, as merely expreſſive of ſome Chimaera, which has no Exiſtence.</p>
                        <p>MODESTY, alludes to ſome Cuſtom among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ladies.</p>
                        <p>EARTHQUAKE, a Party at Cards. (Vide <hi>Rout, Drum,</hi> or <hi>Hurricane.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>FASHION, a polite Term of Excuſe for all the Vices that can be thought of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0311400902:239"/>NATURE, Nothing at all; it is often called <hi>Plaſtic Nature, univerſal Nature,</hi> &amp;c. but the Idea is always the ſame.</p>
                        <p>ROUT, formerly ſignified the Defeat of an Army, and when the Soldiers were all put to flight or to the Sword, they were ſaid to be routed. The Ladies, in order to preſerve ſome Idea of <hi>Creſſi, Poitiers, Blenheim,</hi> &amp;c. have agreed to call their Aſſemblies by the Name of <hi>Routs.</hi> This, it is thought, they do with more Propriety, as frequently at theſe Meetings whole Families are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>routed</hi> out of Houſe and Home.</p>
                        <p>SOUI. It was formerly believed, that in each human Creature there exiſted ſomething incorruptible, which was not to periſh with the Diſſolution of our Bodies, but to be removed to ſome other Part of the Univerſe, and there to enjoy the Reward due to Virtue, or ſuffer condign Puniſhment for all Tranſgreſſions, while in this State of Probation. But the happy Diſcovery of the Properties of Matter has alſo baniſhed this abſurd Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which ſerves now to embelliſh the Fictions of Poets.</p>
                        <p>IMMENSE, an Epithet of Praiſe, thus we ſay <q>an immenſe fine Woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (vide <hi>Damned.</hi>
                           </q>)</p>
                        <p>VIRTUE, The antient <hi>Druids</hi> made it a Rule to keep all their Paſſions in due Government, by which Mean, they were never known to prejudice their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or hurt their own Conſtitutions by Intemperance; and this Practice, it is probable, was ſignified by the Word <hi>Virtue.</hi> It is uſed by <hi>Shakeſpear, Spencer, Milton, Pope,</hi> and other Poets, as a pretty Ornament for their romantic Performances. (Vide <hi>Friendſhip.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>PITY, This is alſo an old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word, the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which cannot be traced; it is now a Word of Courſe, when we do not care a Farthing for a Friend in Affliction.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Club met a few Nights ſince at the <hi>Devil</hi> Tavern, when the Converſation principally turned upon Topics of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and particularly dramatic Poetry. Many of our beſt modern Tragedies were examined, and I obſerved it was frequently ſaid of Pieces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly inartificial in the Fable, unforcible in Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſtitute of Character, that they contained a very fine Vein of Poetry. Our Profeſſor of Criticiſm immediately objected to the Propriety of the Expreſſion. He did not underſtand how a bad Play could have fine Poetry, and he has formed a Plan for a Set of Papers, which may throw ſome Light on this Matter. I ſhall this Day preſent my Readers with one, which I think may ſerve as an Opening to the Deſign.</p>
                  <p>In order to decide upon the Excellence or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of any Art, it is neceſſary to know the original Intent and Aim of that Art, and alſo the ſeveral Means by which it accompliſhes its Deſigns. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to inveſtigate this, with regard to any Branch of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, it will be expedient to trace all Manner of Compoſition to its Source, and thence to purſue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rivulets which have ſtreamed from it. This has been done with great Perſpicuity and Elegance by the Author of the Eſſays on the Characteriſtics, who has very juſtly determined the three primary Branches of Compoſition to be, <hi>Poetry, Eloquence,</hi> and <hi>Argument.</hi> He adds, that a juſt Coalition of the three forms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Beauty of fine Writing, and then, continues
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0311400902:242"/>he, <q>it would be perhaps both a new and pleaſing Speculation to point out the Writers in their ſeveral Kinds, who have been moſt remarkably excellent, or defective with Regard to the juſt Union of theſe three Species of Cempoſition. At preſent it muſt ſuffice to have hinted ſuch a Criticiſm, which the Reader may eaſily proſecute.</q> Such a Criticiſm might diſtinguiſh the reſpective Graces of all Kinds of Writing, and furniſh the Criterions by which to judge of the proper Beauties of each different Species. I ſhall now beg Leave to offer a few curſory Reflections on this Subject; and, in order to proceed with the greater Perſpicuity, ſhall attempt a ſhort Account of the Riſe of the three Modes of Writing already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Man being a ſociable Creature, it was neceſſary, that certain Signs, univerſally agreed upon, ſhould be uſed for the reciprocal Conveyance of his Ideas. Sounds, which we call Words, were the quickeſt Vehicles, and therefore grew into general Uſe. According as our Stock of Ideas enIarged itſelf, the Demand for Words became more extenſive, and as Societies were framed, and People aſſembled by civil Policy, Intercourſe begot further Acquiſitions, and thus, Language was daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. But it being impoſſible that every diſtinct Idea ſhould be expreſſed by a Term appropriated to it, the Mind naturally had Recourſe to the Faculty of Reaſon, which compares, diſtinguiſhes, and ſeparates the Ideas which have paſſed through the Senſes, or have been formed into different Combinations by the Power of Imagination. By theſe Means, a Similitude was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered between ſundry various Images, and thence it followed, that Things were expreſſed by borrowed Names, on account of a Reſemblance exiſting between them. The Term thus transferred was called a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,</hi> and, as it happens in the commercial Intercourſe of Mankind, what was at firiſt introduced out of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, became, in Proceſs of Time, an abſolute Luxury.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0311400902:243"/>This the Poets ſoon perceived; and as it was their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to lead uncultivated Multitudes from their Huts and Dens, by ſeizing their Imaginations with their Songs and Ballads, the Metaphor ſoon appeared to them to be an effectual Means of painting Things in warmer Colours to the Fancy, which is ever greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted when any new and unforeſeen Aſſemblage is offered to its View. The Epithet which denotes the Qualities inherent in all Objects, lent its auxiliary Aid, and Poetry, with theſe adventitious Ornaments became the Delight of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But the Matter did not reſt here; as Cities were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and as States enlarged themſelves, artificial Paſſions began to operate; Ambition then began to graſp at Power and Pre-eminence, and <hi>Envy, Jealouſy, Revenge</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> ſowed the Seeds of Diſcord, and mutual Diſtruſt; and thus while they were diſtracted with inteſtine Commotions, the adjacent States, deſirous of extending their Poſſeſſions, made Inroads upon them. In theſe Emergencies there was not Time for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Writer to produce his poetic Compoſition; an immediate Addreſs was requiſite to influence the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Multitude, and therefore Men of Genius came forth, and deſtitute of Number, addreſſed the People in humble Proſe. But here, ſtill the Attention was to be fixed, and therefore they could not diveſt themſelves of all the Properties of Poetry, but continued to addreſs themſelves to the Imagination of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and thus to influence their Paſſions and perſwade them to their own Good. As the leaſt Appearance of a Deſign upon their Underſtandings on theſe Occaſions would totally defeat itſelf, it thence reſulted, that all thoſe ambitious Ornaments, and all thoſe gaudy Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which Poetry ſpreads ſo laviſhly on every Subject, were here introduced with a more ſparing Hand, and the Imagination was only addreſſed as it affords various Acceſſes to the Paſſions. In this Manner Eloquence
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0311400902:244"/>deduced its being; and was only a leſs luxuriant Kind of Poetry, which endeavoured to practiſe the Arts of Perſuaſion, and to win over the Paſſions of the People to its own End and Uſe.</p>
                  <p>In Proportion as Mankind became enlightened, as Arts and Manufactures encreaſed, and as Science ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended itſelf, it was not enough that <hi>Poetry</hi> charmed with its graceful Combinations, and that <hi>Eloquence</hi> awakened and agitated the Paſſions; <hi>Reaſon</hi> began then to exert its Influence, to look for Utility and Truth in every Compoſition, and ſtripping away the Luxuriances of laviſh Deſcription, it began cooly and diſpaſſionately to conſider every Thing that was offered. Hence ſprung the <hi>Didactic,</hi> or the Argumentative; <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was obliged to proceed by fair Deductions, and as much as poſſible to conceal his Art from a People, who were ſo poliſhed, that they would have deſpiſed thoſe Arts of Perſuaſion, which <hi>Tully</hi> practiſed with Succeſs upon Minds leſs artful and leſs informed than the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Manner, it appears to me, theſe three pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Branches of Compoſition aroſe in the World, each being plainly deducible from the very Principles of our Conſtitution. For as the Imagination is the warmeſt Faculty of the Soul, <hi>Poetry,</hi> whoſe principal Intent is to pleaſe, is particularly addreſſed to this Power of Perception. <hi>Eloquence,</hi> though more chaſte and reſerved in its Embelliſhments, ſtrikes chiefly at the Paſſions, and as they are then moſt powerfully excited, when Fancy pictures ſtrong Appearances of Good or Evil. <hi>Eloquence</hi> is obliged to have Recourſe to the Regions of Imagination, in order to render its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourings ſtronger and more glowing; and further, as the Province of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is to compare its Ideas, and to form various Affirmations or Negations relative to them, the <hi>Didactic</hi> is principally confined to this Province. There are not in human Nature any other Inlets of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or any other Faculties of Senſation to which
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0311400902:245"/>the Art of a Writer could apply, and therefore the Imagination, the Paſſions, and Reaſon are juſtly the three Springs of Compoſition. But Men of Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reflection, perceiving what a powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence any one of theſe Branches of Writing has upon the Mind, have thence inferred, that the joint Force of all three united, muſt carry the Power of Genius to ſtill a greater Degree of Perfection, and, therefore, in whatever Way they were engaged, they have made it their Buſineſs to make Excurſions into their Neighbours Territories, and borrow thence ſeveral Improvements to heighten their Productions. As for Inſtance, in like Manner, as <hi>Eloquence</hi> has learned from <hi>Poetry</hi> to warm and enliven the Imagination, <hi>Poetry</hi> has marked the Influence of <hi>Eloquence</hi> on the Paſſions, and has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to glide to the Heart through the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; and both have alſo found it neceſſary to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and have occaſionally ſtrengthened themſelves with Inſertions of the <hi>Didactic.</hi> The reaſoning Faculty has, in its Turn, perceived, that a mere Train of Deductions would be too dry, and therefore it takes Occaſion to adorn itſelf with the Flowers of Imagination, and, in ſome Speculations, it even endeavours to awaken the Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>Hence then it appears, that a Concurrence of the primary Branches of Writing is requiſite in all Works of Genius; but, as there is ſome Danger of running Riot, and making too frequent and unjuſtifiable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes into each others Territories, it was neceſſary to fix the Boundaries of each Kind, and to determine how far any one of them may indulge itſelf in its Approaches towards the others, in order to preſerve the eſſential Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in every Compoſition, to obſerve the proper Qualities, and the juſt Colourings of each; or as <hi>Horace</hi> has it,

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0311400902:246"/>There are in Nature but few original Colours, and it is from the Meltings and Softenings of theſe into each other, that all other Appearances to the Eye derive their Origin. It is the fame in Writing; the ſeveral Species of it, which are now practiſed, are Modes of <hi>Poetry, Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> differently blended. How far the Union is juſt, ſhall be occaſionally exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a few detached Eſſays; and by theſe Means we ſhall ſee the peculiar Merit of an <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> a <hi>Comedy,</hi> &amp;c. and the Reader may at his Leiſure carry the Reſearch into ſeveral ſubordinate Branches of Writing.</p>

I am induced to it, by an Advertiſement in the common News Papers, calculated merely for the Uſe of the rougher Sex, without any Regard to the weak, but lovely, Part of the Creation, who ſtand moſt in need of adventitious Aids, to guide them in an Age of Vice and Folly. The Advertiſement I mean is as follows:</p>

I have by hard Study found out Medicines that will give perfect Redreſs to any afflicted with the venereal Infection, or Weakneſs of Body, from any Injuries, in a ſhort Time—from Mr.</hi> J.

                        <p>Would not one imagine, upon Peruſal of the firſt Part of this Advertiſement, that it is the Effuſion of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in ſome Clergyman, prompted by a laudable Zeal to encourage the Obſervance of the Commandment for the Propagation of the Species, and add his Efforts to ſtrengthen the late Marriage Act. <hi>To prepare for that important State.</hi>—Does not this Expreſſion ſuggeſt Ideas of our awful Religion, and the ſolemn Inſtitution eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by it?—And then how diſintereſted is the ſweeteſt of his Senſations!—It does not lie in the Palm of his Hand, but plays around his generous Heart, and is an Indication of a pure and extenſive Charity.

                        <p>Inſtead of producing a large Number of Vouchers for the ſalutary Effects already felt from my Medicine, I ſhall cloſe my Letter with the Hiſtory of two female Reigns; for every Beauty is, for a Time, the Queen of her Admirers. The firſt is that of a beautiful Tyrant, who made a wrong Uſe of her Power; the ſecond, of a more diſcreet Sovereign, who had recourſe to the above Recipe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>MARIA</hi> aſcended the Throne of Beauty in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of her Age; immediately upon her Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe diſſolved her Parliament, turned out of her Privy-Council every Perſon of Senſe and Diſcretion, and introduced, in their Room, a <hi>French</hi> Hair-Cutter, two Milliners, a Chambermaid, and many other Perſonages of equal Rank and Condition. By the Advice of theſe Aſſiſtants ſhe reigned with deſpotic Sway. She heard the Complaints of her Slaves without ever feeling the leaſt Propenſity to a Redreſs of their Grievances, which occaſioned violent Heart-burnings, and at Length called forth a Shoal of Writers againſt her Government, as generally happens in all political States, when the ſupreme Power is abuſed. A Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sonnetteers, Libellers, and Epigrammatiſts, who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0311400902:251"/>daily poured forth Treaſon againſt her Beauty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her born to enſlave Mankind. She had a very particular Pleaſure in ſigning metaphorical Death. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants for her Votaries; and ſhe looked upon the whole Race of Mankind formed to flatter her Vanity, and to pay her Adoration. She exacted Tributes of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at ſuch an exorbitant Rate, that at laſt an <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> aroſe, who diſputed with her a Contribution of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences which ſhe inſiſted upon. This Proceeding open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eyes of the reſt of her Subjects, who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to dethrone her in the twenty-third Year of her Age; and then fell the Tyrant <hi>Maria,</hi> without one to lament her Fall, after a ſhort Reign of five Years, in which ſhe conquered with ſo wild a Rage, as the Poet has it, that, with the univerſal Joy, ſucceeded to her, the fair <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Reign commenced, like a mild Evening after the violent Scorching of a hot Summer's Day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> endeavoured to render herſelf the Miſtreſs of all willing Hearts, and valued herſelf more upon the Love of her Subjects, than any idle Flattery ſhe might extort from them. The Poet's Deſcription was perfectly adapted to her;
<q>
                              <l>

                        <p>She had no She-Friends in her Cabinet-Council, but guided herſelf entirely by the Directions of Prudence, Virtue, and good Senſe. An <hi>Eſſex,</hi> at length, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf more particularly into her good Graces; but ſhe had ſuch a Command over her Paſſions, that ſhe never diſgraced him by a Blow, but, in the End, took him as an Aſſociate into her Empire, which ſhe, in a ſhort Time, finally reſigned, in order to enjoy the calmer Gratifications of a domeſtic Life, where ſhe now ſhines with every amiable Grace, while <hi>Toaſts</hi> and other
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0311400902:252"/>ambitious Beauties fatigue their Eyes, and weary every Feature, in vain, to gain them Admirers.</p>

                     <p>By Advices from ſundry Parts of the Country we learn, that Blood and Blank-Verſe have had a ſurpriſing Effect upon the Minds of the Country People, during the Summer-Expedition of the Actors; particularly from a Country-Town, on the Borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the following remarkable Incident: A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, arriving at an Inn, after a long Day's Journey, with a Hare, which was given him as a Preſent on his Way, and with which he intended to regale at Night, ordered it to be roaſted for his Supper; but the Landlord told him, it could not be. Why ſo pray? —Why, I'll tell you Maſter—We have a Company of Players in Town.—Well, what then?—Why I'll tell
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0311400902:253"/>you, Maſter—I have lent them the Wheel we always roaſt with.—Lent 'em the Wheel!—What for? Why you muſt know—they act <hi>Venice Preſerved,</hi> Maſter— and <hi>Pierre,</hi> you know, is to be broke on the Wheel, in the laſt Act, and ſo they have got our's to do it with, and alſo the Chain; becauſe you know <hi>Pierre</hi> is to wear Chains. The Reſult was, the Gentleman was obliged to wait the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of the Play, before he could have Execution done on his Hare, when the Landlord begged hard for a Part of it for his favourite <hi>Pierre,</hi> who, he ſaid, was a brave Man.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of my Motto was one of the beſt Crities the World has ever produced, and he has, in the above Lines, compriſed the three principal Qualities of Poetry. Its Aim, ſays he, is to afford at once Utility and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to offer what may be agreeable to the Fancy, and alſo what may conduce to the Advantages of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life. He further adds, it is not enough for a Poem to abound in Prettyneſſes, it muſt alſo have a ſweet Acceſs to the Heart, and ſhould be able to agitate the Soul with what Paſſions it pleaſes. This Deſcription involves all the leading Requiſites of Poetry; and, it is
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0311400902:254"/>remarkable, includes the three primary Branches of Compoſition, exhibited in a former Paper, <hi>viz.</hi> the Art of addreſſing our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in order to be uſeful, the Imagination, to be agreeable, and the Paſſions, in order to perſuade and gain upon our Affections. Here then we have <hi>Poeſy, Eloquence,</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> united, and moſt aſſuredly, that Performance will be found the moſt excellent in its Kind, which is the moſt highly finiſhed with Regard to theſe three Eſſentials.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry has always had the Pre-eminence, and, I ſuppoſe, the Reaſon of this Determination, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it affords the freeſt and moſt ample Room for a Diſplay of the three primary and original Species of Writing, It is by obſerving how theſe friendly Colours mix and blend with each other, that we are to deduce a Judgment upon the different Authors, who have proved any Way eminent in the literary World, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt Principles, being the only Criterion in every Art. <hi>Boſſu</hi> and other Critics have informed us, that the epic Fable muſt involve one entire Action; that this Action muſt have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End; They have told us, that the Poet muſt not take up the Thread of his Narrative too near the Clue; but that he muſt haſten into the Midſt of Things, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally give a Retroſpect to ſuch Things as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known. They have treated largely of the Machinery, of the Time the Fable ſhould include, with many other Particulars, which though proper to be explained, do not any Way conduce to the Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Taſte, or the Improvement of true Genius. It is moſt certain; by obſerving from what Principles in the human Frame each Art is deducible, that any real or valuable Criticiſm can be formed.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt then, that the Epic Writer has free Latitude of inſerting all the Graces of every Kind of Compoſition. All Nature lies at his Command; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0311400902:255"/>he caſts his Eyes, he is Lord of the Manor; he can turn a Road, by poetical Act of Parliament, through Lawns and Groves, and Scenes of Paſturage; the four Seaſons obey his Directions, and he need never be at a Loſs for agreeable Exhibitions of Nature, to pleaſe the Imagination. The whole Syſtem of Ethics is alſo his; he may frequently take occaſion to improve his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by ſhort Sentences, and tranſient Reflections on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life, and by theſe Means he may gain upon our Reaſon to approve his Performances. The whole Art of Eloquence is likewiſe perfectly open to the Epic Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and from thence he may derive an irreſiſtible Power over our Paſſions. In this laſt mentioned Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the <hi>Abbé du Bos</hi> places the conſummate Perſection of fine Poetry. Certain it is, the Mind of Man never feels ſuch intenſe Pleaſure from any of the imitative Arts, as when its Paſſions are awakened, and it finds itſelf rouſed from an impaſſive State, and unexpectedly agitated by the ſkilful Touches of a Maſter-poet. The Author juſt quoted aſcribes this ideal Appearance to the Satisfaction which the Soul enjoys at the Perception of its own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: May we not add to this, what is ſuggeſted, if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right, by the Author of <hi>The Pleaſure of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations?</hi> "Our moral Senſe receives on the Occaſion an additional Delight, to ſee that the ſocial Affections are in Harmony' and Proportion, and feelingly awake to the due Senſations of Humanity; and this, in Conjunction with the Gratifications, which we are apt to take in comparing the Ideas, which Reality has ſuggeſted, with thoſe excited by the Art of Imitation, conſpire to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a warm and well-executed Paſſage in Poetry, ſo agreeable to all Mankind in general."</p>
                  <p>Were I to declare in which of the three Powers of the Mind, already mentioned, I think <hi>Homer, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> to be moſt eminently ſhining; I ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0311400902:256"/>to <hi>Homer</hi> the ſtrongeſt and moſt vigorous Efforts of Imagination, and an amazing Faculty of alarming us with noble and amazing Deſcriptions of all the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Objects in Nature. As to our own <hi>Milton,</hi> I ſhould be inclined to declare him a Rival of the <hi>Greek</hi> Poet, for a comprehenſive Sublimity of Conception: and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Excellence I ſhould place in beautiful Touches of poetic Eloquence. His whole fourth Book I take to be a Maſter-piece in this Way. The various Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mind which <hi>Dido</hi> endures, her Love, her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, her Rage, her Tenderneſs, her many mixed Emotions, are perhaps the fineſt Strokes in Poetry. In his ſixth Book alſo there are ſeveral Scenes of the moſt tender Nature; and, in the ninth Book, the Grief of the Mother, after the Death of <hi>Niſus</hi> and <hi>Euryalus,</hi> and the Lamentations of <hi>Evander,</hi> are all to be ranked in the ſame Claſs, and, in my Opinion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a Pleaſure, not to be met with in either of the other Poets, even though <hi>Homer</hi> has ſucceeded ſo well in <hi>Hector</hi>'s laſt Scene with <hi>Andromache,</hi> and though our great <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> has a great Deal of finely impaſſionated Dialogue in his juſtly celebrated Poem. <hi>Virgil</hi> more frequently applies himſelf to the Paſſions of his Readers than the other two; and, notwithſtaneing ſome pretty ſtrong Improbabilities, he does not ſo frequently ſhock our Reaſon, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet, who certainly, in ſome Particulars, is extravagant to the higheſt Degree. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> has the Advantage of having founded his Story up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Traditions, which our Religion has ſanctified, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhould conſider his fallen Angels, and the War waged by them, together with the Invention of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and many other Circumſtances, highly chimerical, even though they expand our Fancy with grand and ſurprizing Appearances.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take another Opportunity to conſider how far Tragedy may diſpute with the Epic for the Preference,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0311400902:257"/>and ſhall only add at preſent, that I have ever been of Opinion, that all the Writers of heroic Poeſy have, in general, been too fond of the Marvellous. By this I would not be underſtood to cenſure the Uſe of Machinery, which, when introduced with Sobriety and Diſcretion, ſerves to preſent agreeable Scenery to the Mind; and I could wiſh that the Correctneſs of Mr. <hi>Glover</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not entirely excluded it from his Poem of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas,</hi> which certainly has many Paſſages of warm po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etic Eloquence, many Pieces of beautiful Imagery, and ſeveral Strictures of uſeful and improving Morality, artfully interwoven with the Ground-work of his Fable.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall beg leave to conclude with an Obſervation, which is not entirely foreign to the Purpoſe. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> that <hi>Virgil</hi> has but one Conceit throughout his Poem, and that, ſays he, is put into the Mouth of the young <hi>Julus,</hi> when, with a Kind of punning Ambiguity, he obſerves, that they are eating their Tables. But ſurely the great Critic had forgot the Paſſage, where the Poet tells us, that <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in runuing round a Tree after the flying <hi>Turnus,</hi> follows the Man who follows him.—<hi>Sequiturque ſequentem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, tried by the Rule of <hi>Bohours,</hi> appears to have Truth for its Foundation; but it is ſo childiſh a Truth, that I am ſorry to find it intermixed with the Majeſty of the <hi>Aeneid;</hi> but, perhaps, it is like the Fly on the Picture, which a minute Obſerver was going to bruſh away, and then found it was placed there on purpoſe by the Hand of the Artiſt.</p>

                     <hi>Mingehan</hi> was no ſooner fixed at <hi>Bagdad,</hi> than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0311400902:260"/>of his Affluence ſpread itſelf abroad. In all convivial Meetings among the reſt of the Merchants, as ſoon as his Lips ſeemed to open, every Tongue was ſuſpended with Silence, every Eye gazed at him with Admiration, and every Ear devoured the Periods of his Story with greedy Earneſtneſs. His Voice, which naturally was as rough as the Sound occaſioned by a Colliſion of Billows on the Ocean, now ſeemed as foſt as the fragrant Gale, which pants upon the Leaves of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Trees.</p>
                  <p>By this Time <hi>Mirgehan</hi>'s Credit was become ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that People of all Ranks and Conditions depoſited their Money with him, and he had every Day a very great Number of Servants counting over the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins of Gold, which he was either to receive or pay away for others. In the Midſt of all theſe Smiles of Fortune, it happened, that the Relict of a rich Merchant, lately ſnatched away from the Face of the Earth, by the Angel of Death, attracted his Attention. Her Name was <hi>Dardanè,</hi> born in the City of <hi>Damas,</hi> and now in the Poſſeſſion of very great Wealth. From the Habits, which Education and Time had implanted in her, ſhe was in her Temper of a moſt greedy Avarice, and a powerful Ambition to be counted richer than the reſt of her Acquaintance; urged by theſe Inſtigations, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed her lovely Form upon <hi>Mirgehan,</hi> who, in a ſhort Time, ſo contrived it, that the Roſes faded on her Cheek, the Lilly appeared of a yellower Hue, and by flow Degrees, her Conſtitution received ſuch ſevere Strokes from his Severity, that ſhe totally pined away, and, in a ſhort Time, lay breathleſs on her Bed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mirgehan</hi> was now happy in the Completion of his Wiſhes; he had got rid of a Wife, whom, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her exquiſite Beauty, his Soul ever abhorred, and he exulted in the Review of the vaſt Acceſſion to his Fortune, which, through her Means, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0311400902:261"/>His Heatt now began to expand with greater Alacrity, and he reſolved to ſpend the Remainder of his Days in Eaſe, in Elegance, in Luxury, and every delicate Enjoyment. The Dainties of the Eaſt did not ſuffice to crown his Board; he would ſend to the Weſt for <hi>Turtle,</hi> and every Corner of the Globe adminiſtred to his Gratifications. Not far from <hi>Bagdad,</hi> he purchaſed a moſt elegant and magnificent Houſe, where he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to fix his country Retreat. The Rooms eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſounded with Singers and Minſtrels; Amber and Aloes contributed their rich Perfumes; and his Tables were covered with Vaſes of Agate, filled with the moſt delicious Liquors. Painting and Sculpture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to adorn his Apartments. <hi>Mirgehan</hi> was led into all this Profuſion by an irreſiſtible Vanity, from which he derived many exquiſite Senſations of Pleaſure; when he found his Wealth and his Poſſeſſions admired, he the more readily ſuffered himſelf to be governed by this Turn of Mind, from a Conviction, that all his grand Appearance of Affluence, ſerved to extend his Reputation, and that, in Conſequence of his extenſive Credit, he ſhould have ample and frequent Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of re-imburſing himſelf, by the Uſe he knew to make of the pecuniary Confidence, which others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mirgehan</hi> was now happy in all the Enjoyments which Riches could procure him; his Heart danced to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Tunes of Joy, and the Meanneſs of his Birth he thought ſufficiently compenſated by the Luſtre and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his preſent Way of Life. And now, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Elevation, and to raiſe himſelf to that Point of Eminence, from which he imagined, he might look down upon moſt of his Fellow-Creatures, Fortune, who had for a Series of Years ſmiled propitiouſly upon all the Undertakings of <hi>Mirgehan,</hi> at length preſented an Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0311400902:262"/>It happened, that the Emperor of <hi>Bagdad</hi> had Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on a particular Emergence in his Affairs, to call together an Aſſembly of the wiſeſt and ableſt Heads in his Territories, in order to aſſiſt his Councils, to help him in framing ſalutary Laws, for the due Regulation of his Subjects, and to point out proper Meaſures for him to levy the Monies neceſſary towards defraying the Expences of his Soldiers, and other Contingences in Government. The <hi>Califf</hi> reſolved upon this Step, with the Advice of his <hi>Vizir,</hi> and, in a few Days, Mandates were diſpatched to ſundry different Parts, commanding the Provinces and Towns to depute to the general Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, two Perſons the moſt renowned for Sagacity and Judgment. <hi>Mirgehan</hi> was at his Country-Seat, when he heard this News, and his Paſſions being violent as the eddying Sand during a Tempeſt; he inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Deſire to be enrolled among the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Politicians of <hi>Bagdad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accordingly he forthwith ſet out upon this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he had not gone far from his own Habitation, when travelling a ſolitary Road, over a long extended Mountain, the Heat of the Day, together with the Fatigue he had undergone, inclined him to ſtop under a ſhady Retreat, and refreſh his Senſes with a gentle Slumber. From this he was ſoon awakened by a Strain of Muſick, which thrilled ſo melodiouſly in his Ears, that he thought Gleams of Paradiſe were opening to his dazled Sight. He looked around, and ſaw a reverend Form advance towards him; <hi>Mirgehan</hi> aroſe from the Arbour, in which he was reclined; and inſtantly throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf on his Knees, he worſhipped the venerable Appearance which ſtood before him. This Perſonage was an holy Hermit, who long inhabited a ſmall Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Side of a Rock, which terminated the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect on the left Side of the Mountain. Being endowed with a magic Power, he called forth to his Sight ſuch
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0311400902:263"/>beautiful Scenes, as looked like a new Creation. <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gehan</hi>'s Heart throbbed with holy Rapture. At length the hoary Sage began. <q>
                        <hi>Mirgehan,</hi> I know thy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; I am acquainted with thy Deſign in this thy Journey. But reflect, O Man! on the Obſcurity of thy Birth, and the Meanneſs of thy Education. Canſt thou confer Light to the Councils of the Wiſe? Canſt thou diſpel the Miſt from before their Eyes, and let in powerful Irradiations of Truth upon their darkling Underſtandings? Deſiſt, vain Man, from thy ill-founded Purſuits.</q> At theſe Words the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hermit waved his Wand, and ſuddenly the Scene vaniſhed like a Morning-Dream from <hi>Mirgehan</hi>'s Eyes. After having again raiſed his Arm; <q>Now, ſays he, let the Objects that are placed before thee inſtruct thy Soul; there behold how eaſily thou mighteſt have ſquandered away all thoſe Poſſeſſions, which thy Soul delights in for a mere empty Bubble. There ſee an Election for two Perſons to aſſiſt in the Debates for the Eaſe and Happineſs of the Califf, and his People; ſee the Blind, the Lame, the Old, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, the Sick arriving in Caravans, to vote for thoſe who pay them higheſt. See how they all ſolemnly vow by the holy Prophet, that Money has no Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon them; and yet behold how in private they graſp the Sequins of Gold! Does not thy Heart, which has fixed all its Affections upon thy yellow Dirt, tremble within thee, to think that in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all thy Wealth might be ſquandered away, and thou not be able to render the leaſt Service to the Califf, thy Country, or thy Family? That this is the Fate of many, who, like thee, have aroſe from mean Beginnings, and have, in their old Days, proved mere Spendthrifts, thou may'ſt receive ocular Demonſtration, by ſurveying thoſe Wretches, who are now deſpiſed by their Country, deteſted by their
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0311400902:264"/>Relations, and deſpiſed by the <hi>Vizier,</hi> in whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they exhauſted all their Treaſures.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Zemroude</hi> (for that was the Hermit's Name) perceiving the Affections of <hi>Mirgehan</hi> perfectly changed, diſperſed into the Air his new Creation, returned with ſolemn Step to his Cell under the Rock, and <hi>Mirgehan</hi> ordered his Camels to be turned towards <hi>Bagdad,</hi> where he ſpent the Remainder of his Days in Eaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and, at his Death, he left thoſe Sums of Gold, which he was going to ſquander in viſionary Schemes, among his Relations, who now live in Affluence, and the Memory of <hi>Mirgehan</hi> is reſpected among them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is not a Species of Writing which has not had its particular Admirer, and various Affirmations have been made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Excellence of each. The famous Doctor <hi>South</hi> was of Opinion, that a complete Epigram is the Maſter-piece of Compoſition; and Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> calls a <hi>perfect Tragedy the nobleſt Production of Human Nature.</hi> The Truth of it is, each Perſon has delivered his Sentiments agreeably to his own private Temper, and his own peculiar Turn of Thinking. Doctor <hi>South</hi> excelled in lively and ſurprizing Strokes of Wit; every new Combination, which he formed in the vivacious Sallies of his Imagination, was Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram in itſelf, and we find all his Writings ſown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely thick with unexpected Aſſemblages; and on
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0311400902:266"/>this Account we may ſuppoſe him inclinable to extol his own favourite Talent. In like Manner, Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> had employed many of his Hours in planning his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of <hi>Cato,</hi> and after it had received the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Poliſh, which his Skill could beſtow upon it, it was to be exhibited as the greateſt Production of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wit. But the Aſſertions of great Men, when they are unſuſtained by Argument, are not to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Decrees from which there can be no Appeal: Tragedy moſt certainly can only claim the ſecond Place, becauſe it is manifeſt, that all the Powers of Genius, <hi>viz. Imagination, Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> may be exerted in their full Force in the Epic Compoſition, whereas in Tragedy they frequently ſuffer great Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The ſame Thing, which on many Occaſions makes Tragedy the moſt powerful Performance, ſerves alſo to diveſt it of thoſe Advantages which give great Brilliancy to heroic Poeſy, and that is, its coming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before the Eye. It is juſtly remarked by <hi>Horace,</hi> that what is conveyed to our Notice through our Ears, acts with a more feeble Impulſe upon the Mind, than Objects that paſs through the Organs of Sight, thoſe faithful Evidences in a mental Court of Judicature.</p>

                  <p>For this Reaſon many Paſſages, in which the Epic Wrietr warms and expands the Imagination of his Readers with the nobleſt Exhibitions of poetic Imagery, are entirely excluded from the dramatic Scene; the Eye will not ſuffer itſelf eaſily to be deluded, and all the Amazement of Machinery is alſo for the ſame Reaſon totally ſuperſeded. A God, ſays the Critic, ſhould

We may in reading ſuffer ſuch an Incident to be impoſed upon us; but the Eye would be too much ſhocked with ſuch Repreſentations, and, of Courſe, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous is entirely baniſhed. Beſides Tragedy will not admit any extraordinary Diſplay of <hi>pure Poetry,</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; the heroic Poet for the moſt Part ſpeaks in his own Perſon, and it is expected of him to pay great Court to our Imagination; but the Dialogue of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, engaged in a Sphere of Action, intended to intereſt the Auditors, will not allow them to take up the Scene with florid Exhibitions of rural Imagery; ſuch as Brooks, murmuring in ſcanty Rills through peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Channels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The following Lines in the Mouth of <hi>Caliſta</hi> in the <hi>Fair Penitent</hi> may be extremely pictureſque, if conſidered as pure Deſcription, but if conſidered with regard to the Situation of Character, they are certainly very inartificial and undramatic.</p>

                  <p>Hence then we find, that in the Regions of Fancy, the <hi>Drama</hi> muſt yield to the Epic, and as this is a very conſiderable Part of Poeſy, I think it determines the Precedence. In the Art of Eloquence, and in all Applications to our Reaſon, Tragedy can boaſt full Room for the moſt vigorous Exertion. The <hi>Drama</hi> may be full as ſentimental as any other Kind of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0311400902:268"/>nay its Excellence frequently conſiſts in being ſo, and with Regard to the Paſſions, the Mode of Imitation, renders its Influence more forcible, and when we are deceived into a Notion that the Perſonages are actually ſuffering Diſtreſs before our Eyes, the Performance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a Kind of Reality, and more keen and intenſer Senſations agitate our Breaſts, than in Pieces where the Deſcription is left to operate upon us without any other Aid than that of lively and impaſſioned Expreſſions. <hi>Virgil,</hi> I apprehend, was as ſkilful a Maſter of the Paſſions as any Writer, ancient or modern; and though the Paſſions of his <hi>Dido</hi> are drawn with as ſtrong and glowing Colourings, as Language can beſtow; though their various ſtrugglings are all finely and cloſely marked, though all their Viciſſitudes, Veerings and Doublings, if I may ſo call them, are finely touched; yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s <hi>Lear</hi> and <hi>Othello</hi> have made much more lively and deep Impreſſions upon an Audience, than ever the former has done upon his Admirers in the Cloſet.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Advantages, however, are derived to the tragic Queen from ſupernumerary Embelliſhments, and from the Labours of another Art, I mean that of acting, which is in itſelf a Mode of Imitation, and ſerves to render the Touches of the Writer more ſtriking, and more feelingly expreſſive. This Superiority the Drama certainly has over the Epic, and in Conſequence of all its additional Aids, it can boaſt a more powerful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the human Heart. It imitates the very Voice of Nature, and ſpeaks the ſame ſimple and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Language. All that Profuſion of Figures, which mere Poetry admits, is diſcarded from the Stage. When I mention Figures, I muſt obſerve, that Men of critical Knowledge have juſtly diſtinguiſhed between Figures of Speech, and Figures of the Sentiment; the former
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0311400902:269"/>including Metaphor and all Tranſtations of Phraſes, and the latter conſiſting of ſuch Breaks and Tranſitions in Diſcourſe, as the Mind is known to make when under the Compunction of warring Paſſions. As for Inſtance, when the Poet ſays of <hi>Dido,</hi> that ſhe is devoured by an inward Flame.
<q>
                        <hi>Et caeco carpitur igne.</hi>
                     </q> He then expreſſes Love by a ſigurative Expreſſion; but when he ſays,
<q>Ignoſcenda <hi>quidem, ſcirent ſi</hi> ignoſcere <hi>manes.</hi>
                     </q> The Repetition expreſſes the natural workings of the Mind, when other Ideas are awakened, and ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a new Conflict of Paſſions. The uſe of theſe kind of Figures in Tragedy ſhould be as free and bold as poſſible, and with Reſpect to Expreſſion, no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be paid to it, than to chuſe ſuch Words as may be moſt ſignificantly pictureſque, in order to have the more lively Effect on the Imagination, the Paſſions being then in a ſtronger Ferment when lively Images are preſented to the Fancy.</p>
                  <p>I believe our <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> is almoſt the only Poet who has excelled in a maſterly Power of ſtriking the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> and our <hi>Reaſon</hi> all at once; but in him Poetry, Sentiment, and Paſſion are combined in the moſt agreeable Aſſemblage. In his Tragedy of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> there are ſeveral ſurprizing Strokes of this <hi>Nature.</hi> Amidſt a great Variety of Inſtances, the following Lines are introduced with a Solemnity ſuitable to the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and they carry with them a pleaſing Kind of gloomy Imagery.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG all the Writers, who have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution, I have not met with any one, that ſeems to be thoroughly acquainted with the Subject. An ingenious Friend of mine, who furniſhed me with an Eſſay ſome Time ſince, reduces our preſent Party-Diviſions into <hi>Garrickeans</hi> and <hi>Barryiſts;</hi> but this is not going to the Bottom of Things. The famous <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſquien</hi> has performed, in my humble Apprehenſion, as little towards a Detection of the Root of the Evil, tho' he ſeems to perceive, with a Kind of prophetic Spirit, the Declenſion of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty. The great <hi>Locke,</hi> who has treated, in a very maſterly Manner of Government, does not any where give us a Clue to guide our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, and after glowing with <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> through a Number of Pages, we are as much in the Dark as ever. <hi>England</hi> can never be undone but by a Parliament, ſays the excellent Author of <hi>the Uſe and abuſe of Parliaments;</hi> but even there, we are again put upon a wrong Scent. The Truth of the Matter is, ENGLAND CAN NEVER BE UNDONE BUT BY THE MOB. I am aware, this may at firſt Sight appear a Paradox; but a Retroſpect to the Behaviour of that Body of People, will convince every intelligent Mind of the Truth of this Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>The Generality of political Writers have waſted a great Deal of Paper in ſettling the various Forms of Government; one, ſay they, is a Monocracy; another is an Ariſtocracy; a third is a Democracy, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution, they inform us, is of the mixed Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0311400902:273"/>conſiſting of a Coalition of all three. But furely a little Obſervation will point out to us, that they have all paſſed by unnoticed another Mode of civil Policy, which cannot be called by a better Name than a <hi>Mobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> under which this Country has been for many Years paſt, and in all human Probability will continue ſo for a long Period ſtill to come; nay, I will be bold to ſay, until Monocracy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy are all ſwallowed up by this alone.</p>
                  <p>There is hardly ever a Bill brought before the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Houſe of Commons, but the Scope of it is immediately canvaſſed in an Aſſembly of the <hi>Mobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy;</hi> where if it paſſes in the Negative, a Deputation is forthwith ſent by them to the Parliament-Houſe, where, though their Remonſtrances are not heard at the Bar, they nevertheleſs enforce their Arguments with ſuch a truly <hi>Britiſh</hi> Eloquence, that they never fail to have a due Degree of Influence upon the Debates within Doors. On theſe Occaſions, they generally make uſe of a Rule of Logick, which indeed is not mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but which is always found of great Efficacy in all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes. The Mode of Reaſoning I mean, is the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Boculinum,</hi> a nervous Exertion of which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the Force of the moſt vigorous Lungs, has over ruled many an intended Act, when it happens not to pleaſe in the Councils of the common People. The <hi>Mobecracy</hi> have further the legiſlative and executive Part of their Laws in their own Hands, and we find them very frequent in a diligent Attention to them. For Inſtance, though the common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has provided a proper Puniſhment for Pickpockets. The <hi>Mobocracy</hi> has reconſidered that Matter, and, after mature Deliberation, have deviſed a Correction, in their Opinion, more adequate to the Offence, and whenever any one is found to incur the Penalty of their Law, they immediately proceed to Execution, without Judge or Jury, which, in their Apprehenſion, ſerve but to retard
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0311400902:274"/>the Courſe of Juſtice, and therefore they ſeize the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, and, without Delay, duck him in the River, the Canal in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, or the next Pool of Water. On all theſe Occaſions, it is obſervable, that they take infinite Delight in ſeeing the proper Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted, as may be obſerved from the Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Huzzas &amp;<hi>c.</hi> wherewith their Burſt of Joy rends the Air. In like Manner, the Pillory is ſome Times ordained by the Statute Law of <hi>England,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to expoſe ſuch Tranſgreſſors as deſerve to be ſet up the Marks of public Shame; on every Occurrence of this Nature, Wiſdom is ſure to cry out in the Streets, and the award of the Judges is determined by a popular Circle to be juſt or unjuſt. When once they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Sentence, the Perſon doomed to make his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is ſure either to meet with their Protection, or to call forth the utmoſt Indignation of an incenſed Populace. Nay, it has been known that theſe perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Dictators have proceeded ſo far as to reſcue Felons, condemned to ſuffer Death, from the Hands of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers, and generouſly to have recalled the Death-Warrant. In many Parts of <hi>England</hi> they have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Averſion to Turnpikes, and it is ſaid they will never be at Reſt, until they have entirely demoliſhed thoſe diſagreeable Paſſports. I remember to have heard a Story of theſe People, which I think may ſerve to give the Reader a tolerable Idea of their arbitrary Power. Not very long ſince three <hi>Indian</hi> Kings came to viſit this Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, and, after they had ſeen moſt Places of Curioſity, a Play was at length advertized by Command of their <hi>Indian</hi> Majeſties. The <hi>Mobocracy,</hi> who have entirely exploded all Notions of the Right Divine of Kings, and who, in Fact, conſider crowned Heads as no more than common Men, took care to attend at the Theatre-Royal in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> in order to ſurvey the ſwarthy Monarchs. At length the Curtain drew up, but in vain did the Players attempt to begin the Diverſion of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0311400902:275"/>the Night The <hi>Mobocracy,</hi> who had Poſſeſſion of the Upper Gallery, declared that they came to ſee the Kings, <q>and ſince we have ſaid our Money, the Kings we will have.</q> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Wilks,</hi> who was then one of the Patentees, came forth and aſſured them that the Kings were in the Front-Box; to this the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bocracy</hi> replied, that they could not ſee them there, and defired that they ſhould be placed in a more conſpicuous point of View, <q>otherwiſe, by G—d <hi>Jack,</hi> there ſhall be no Play.</q> Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> who was not in his Heart of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bocratical Principles, yet loved his own Intereſt ſo well, that he always knew how to be an occaſional Conformiſt, aſſured them that he had nothing ſo much at Heart as their Happineſs, and accordingly got three Chairs and placed the Kings on the Stage, to the no ſmall Satisfaction of the <hi>Mobocracy,</hi> with whom it is a Maxim to have as much as poſſible for their Money. From hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Power of the Multitude is perfectly Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial; and, indeed, in all Ages the Managers of Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes have acquieſced under the Gallery-Juriſdiction. Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> I am credibly informed, notwithſtanding the ſubmiſſive Bows he occaſionally makes them, is not entirely reconciled to their Government, and, it is ſaid, is very apt to quote certain treaſonable Words from <hi>Horace,</hi> implying that the Vulgar have no claim to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallibility. <hi>Interdum Vulgus Rectum videt, eſt ubi peccat.</hi> My Intelligence further adds, that he has ſuppreſſed many Schemes for adding Novelty to the Amuſements of the Public, from a Fear he has conceived of the many-headed Monſter of the Gallery; nay, he will at Times carry Matters ſo far as to pronounce their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour illegal, arbitrary, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and, when they broke all the Windows of his Dwelling-Houſe, ſo diſcontented a Spirit poſſeſſed him, that he would by no Means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Juſtice of their Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Be that as it may; it is certain one diſſaffected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot withſtand the <hi>Mobocratical</hi> Power, which it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0311400902:276"/>is manifeſt has gained great Strength of late Years, and, I am perſuaded, will continue to flouriſh more and more every Day. They have many wiſe Maxims by which they govern themſelves; ſuch as, "no wooden Shoes", —"Liberty and Property and no Exciſe"—<q>no <hi>French</hi> Dancers</q>—"no Mounſeers"—Let every Man toaſt his own Cheeſe, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> ſuch prudential Axioms, founded on the ſobereſt Senſe, muſt undoubtedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to render their Adminiſtration both wiſe and proſperous. It does not appear that they have made any great Progreſs in the modern Art of War; on the contrary, there is Reaſon to ſuppoſe that they all hold it in Contempt; as it is certain that on many Occaſions, when our mixed Form of Government has endeavoured to oppoſe them, by ſending the Soldiery againſt them, they have always laughed at the Military Force, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them from the Aſſault, without their daring to Fire. Their Military Diſcipline ſeems to be derived from the <hi>Romans;</hi> they know no Uſe of Cannon, Fire-Arms, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> but proceed to Battle with Sticks, Bludgeons, ſetting up loud Shouts, ſomewhat like the War-hoop of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and hurling Stones, Brickbats, Bottles, Glaſſes, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> with tremendous Force on the adverſe Party. They are likewiſe totally Strangers to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinements of modern Luxury; Bread and Cheeſe, and Porter being their chief Suſtenance; Gin being only uſed by them when they are low-ſpirited, or are going to be hanged. They do not paint their Bodies with Woad, like the ancient <hi>Britons,</hi> but generally with Kennel-Dirt, which lends them a formidable Air in Battle Thus enured to Danger, it will be no wonder if the <hi>Mobocracy</hi> at length becomes Maſters of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which, as I conceive it, muſt ſhortly be the Caſe, unleſs the Vices of People of Faſhion ſhould deſcend to them, and retard them in their Progreſs. Of this, I muſt own I am inclined to cheriſh ſome Hopes, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that, in ſome Parts of the Town, they drink,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0311400902:277"/>and game and ſwear, and are full as wicked as the better Sort of People. Particularly in <hi>Hockly the Hole,</hi> I am told, that they have a Place called <hi>White</hi>'s Chocolate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, that <hi>clean Lodgings for Travellers</hi> are dearer than ever, and that you cannot any where <hi>Shave for a Penny,</hi> the Depravity of the Times having raiſed the Prices of every Thing there, as well as at the St. <hi>James</hi>'s End of the Town.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Riſtotle</hi> informs us that <hi>Homer</hi> wrote a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic-Epic Poem entitled <hi>Margites,</hi> which to the no ſmall Detriment of ſucceeding Ages, is unfortunately loſt. To this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Poeſy, we may ſuppoſe Comedy has the ſame Reference, that the Tragic bears to the Heroic. For my Part, I cannot conceive why a good Comedy has never been ſtiled by thoſe, who are fond of deciding literary Precedence, the greateſt Production of human Nature. Certainly its conſiſting of known and familiar Ideas, ſhould not derogate from its Merit, becauſe on Account of that very Circumſtance, it meets with leſs Indulgence; the Buſineſs of it coming more near to every Man's Breaſt, and, of Courſe, the very Vulgar being in ſome Meaſure Judges of the Juſtneſs of the Imitation; whereas, in Tragedy, frigid Declamation lulls, florid Epithets amuſe, lofty Metaphors amaze, and ſonorous Expreſſions elevate and ſurprize.</p>
                  <p>As Tragedy aims more particularly at an Excitement of the ſerious Paſſions, ſo the chief Merit of <hi>Comedy</hi> conſiſts in its Effect on the merry Affections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mind; the former principally awakening Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Terro, and Pity, and the latter giving Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a gay Contempt, as it is elegantly called, or in plainer <hi>Engliſh,</hi> making us deſpiſe and laugh at an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at the ſame Time. To ſucceed in this laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Mode of Writing, it requires as fine and as lively
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0311400902:280"/>an Imagination as any of the other imitative Arts; for as it is manifeſt, that the Tragic Poet then excites in us the moſt intenſe Senſations, when his Expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the livelieſt Images to the Fancy, ſo the Comic Poet, when he ſeizes the Imagination with a bright Aſſemblage of ludicrous Ideas, is ſure of agitating thoſe Paſſions, to which his Art directs him, with an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Power. And therefore this Animadverſion is ſufficient to put an End to that idle Diſpute, which, as we learn from <hi>Horace,</hi> engaged the Learned, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Comedy might be called Poetry or not.

                     </q> It is manifeſt that it is an imitative Art, and different Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions being the Objects of its Addreſs, it only makes uſe of Means different from the more elevated Species of Writing; but ſurely it is full as hard a Taſk to paint or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Things, as Objects of more Importance; and, in my Opinion, <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Line which deſcribes an old Woman running acroſs <hi>Dido</hi>'s Apartment with officious Zeal,

                  <p>The Comic Writer, as well as the Tragedian, muſt derive his Force from the true primary Sources of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; that is to ſay, he muſt learn to ſeize our <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,</hi> with ſtriking Pictures of human Life; he muſt inſtruct our Reaſon by inſerting ſenſible Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on worldly Contingencies, and he muſt alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently apply himſelf to thoſe Paſſions which it is the Merit of his Art to awaken. In this laſt mentioned
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0311400902:281"/>Particular conſiſts the real Merit of a well wrought Comedy; in like Manner as the ſerious Drama muſt fill us with Ideas proper to excite Terror and Pity. To obtain either Effect, the Poet is to ſelect ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in every Object, in every Paſſion, and in every Action, as will be moſt conducive to his peculiar End, and he is conſtantly to avail himſelf of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as will ſerve to convey the livelieſt Images to the Fancy. When this is rightly performed, whether in the ſolemn or humourous Scene, it is true Poetry, and in either caſe it is by the Means of a Mode of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the Art produces its deſired Effect. For Ridicule, by which Comedy works, is as much a Mode of Eloquence, as the ſeveral Arts of Perſuaſion, and the ſeveral Figures, which Rhetoric has reduced into a Syſtem for the Excitement of the more ſerious Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>The Diſpute that ſubſiſted among the Learned for a conſiderable Time, and is perhaps not yet determined, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Ridicule is a Teſt of Truth, is, in my humble Opinion, extremely idle and frivolous; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Reaſon, which compares our Ideas, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains or rejects the various Affirmations concerning them, being the ſole Judge of Truth, however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the Means may be by which it gains its End. I have often wondered, that neither <hi>Ariſtotle, Tully,</hi> nor <hi>Quintilian,</hi> have given a juſt and adequate Deſinition of Ridicule. To ſay that it conſiſts in raiſing our Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at ſome Turpitude, is a very inſufficient Account of the Matter. Mr. <hi>Fulding,</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Joſeph Andrews,</hi> has thrown ſome Light upon the Matter, but as he places the Source of it in Affectation, he appears to me not to have taken a comprehenſive Survey of his Subject. I apprehend the Ridiculous may be formed, where there is no Affectation at the Bottom, and his Parſon <hi>Adams</hi> I take to be an Inſtance of this Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0311400902:282"/>The beſt and moſt accurate Deſinition I have ever met with of the Ridiculous is in a Note of Doctor <hi>Aken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi>'s to his excellent Poem <hi>on the Pleaſures of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 
                     <q>That, ſays he, which makes Objects ridiculous is ſome Ground of Admiration or Eſteem connected with other more general Circumſtances, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively worthleſs or deformed; or it is ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Turpitude or Deformity connected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is in general excellent or beautiful; the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Properties exiſting either in the Objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in the Apprehenſion of the Perſon to whom they relate, implying Sentiment or Deſign, and exciting no acute or vehement Emotion of the Heart.</q> The Effect which the Circumſtances thus ſpecified have upon us he thus deſines; <q>the Senſation of Ridicule is not a bare Perception of the Agreement or Diſagreement of Ideas, but a Paſſion or Emotion of the Mind conſequential to that Perception.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emotions here intended are Laughter and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and theſe it is the Buſineſs of Comedy to excite, by making ſtriking Exhibitions of inconſiſtent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, blended together in ſuch a thwarting Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage, that a gay Contempt irreſſiſtibly ſhall take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of us. To perform this in all Objects which come before the Comic Muſe, in Men and Manners, in all Actions and Paſſions, requires a very delicate Hand, and it frequently is neceſſary to have an almoſt micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopic Eye to perceive the latent Inconſiſtency in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſeemingly fair and praiſe-worthy. <hi>Prion</hi> has expreſſed this with his uſual Delicacy;
<q>
                        <l>

                  <p>In producing Portraits of Mankind it is not enough to diſplay Foibles and Oddities; a fine Vein of Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule muſt run through the whole, to urge the Mind to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0311400902:283"/>frequent Emotions of Laughter; otherwiſe there will be Danger of exhibiting diſagreeable Characters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affording the proper Entertainment I think <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi> extremely apt to err in this Point; his <hi>Moroſe,</hi> is a ſurly, ill-natured, abſurd Humouriſt, whom we can hardly laugh at, and he ſoon becomes very bad Company. Many of <hi>Johnſon</hi>'s Characters are of the ſame Caſt, while in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s <hi>Falſtaff,</hi> the ridiculous Ideas are placed in ſuch an artful Point of View, that our Merriment can never be reſtrained, whenever Sir <hi>John</hi> appears. <hi>Congreve</hi> in my Opinion had a great Deal of the ſame Talent, and what I have ſomewhere ſeen objected to him, that many of his Characters are obvious in human Life, is with me a ſtrong Proof of his ſuperior Genius. An Old <hi>Batchelor,</hi> for Inſtance, is very common, but he muſt paſs through ſuch an Imagination as <hi>Congreve</hi>'s to ſupport ſeveral Scenes in the Drama with the moſt exquiſite Pleaſantry; tho' the Character was not new, yet his Management of it has all the Graces of Novelty, and the Situations in which we ſee him are all exquiſitely ridiculous. Perſonages of this Claſs, unleſs artfully conducted, may very ſoon tire an Audience, but in this excellent Poet's Hands nothing ſuffers a Diminution. The ſame, I think, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his Sir <hi>Paul Plyant,</hi> in which Character there is perhaps as much Comic Force as in any one Piece on the Stage. Sir <hi>John Vanbrugh</hi> was alſo a perfect Maſter of his Art in this Reſpect, and of this his Sir <hi>John Brute</hi> is a remarkable Proof. The Knight is conſtantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting us with an odd whimſical Way of Thinking, which at once ſerves to diſplay his own Foibles, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains his Audience with a Pleaſantry of which he ſeems all along totally unconſcious himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore by placing the Humours and Foibles of human Nature in a ridiculous Light, that the true Comic Force is created. The Author of <hi>the Pleaſures of Imagination,</hi> whom I have already quoted, has judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0311400902:284"/>explained each Part of the Deſinition cited above, and has finely traced the ſeveral Sources from which true Ridicule ſprings. Whoever chuſes to conſider the Matter will find Affectation to be but one Spring, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diffuſive the Streams of it may be. To the Poem itſelf I beg leave to refer my Readers, and I ſhall diſmiſs this Paper, with obſerving, that the whole Beauty of the Comic Diction conſiſts in the Words and Phraſes being ſo choſen as to give to the Mind the moſt lively Impreſſion of known and familiar Images, and at the ſame Time the ſtrongeſt Marks of Character and each Perſon's peculiar Temper.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING in my laſt offered ſome curſory Remarks upon RIDICULE, I ſhall in this Day's Paper take Notice of a Species of Writing, which on Account of ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity between them, is often ſuppoſed to be the ſame with the Ridiculous; and yet, upon an attentive View of the Matter, it appears to be a Mode of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion introduced by Men of Genius in order to fall in with that Propenſity to Laughter, which prevails with all Mankind in general. What I here intend is <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque;</hi> to mark its Boundaries, its Procedure and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will be no improper Subject among theſe Eſſays, which only pretend now and then to glance ſo much Light upon Matters of this Nature, as may ſerve to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them to the Unlearned.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be remembered, that as the <hi>Ridiculous</hi> conſiſts in a Coalition of Circumſtances repugnant to each other in their own Natures, but yet whimſically blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in any Object, any human Action or Paſſion, to call forth this Inconſiſtency to public View, and to ſhew the heterogeneous Aſſemblage, in ſuch a Manner as to provoke the Mind to laugh at it with Contempt, is to exert the rare and excellent talent of <hi>Ridicule,</hi> and as this when well executed is attended with fine conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential Effects, the Lovers of <hi>Burleſque</hi> will not wait to diſcover a real Incongruity, but by the Force of their own Imaginations they create it for themſelves, and by
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0311400902:287"/>obtruding Circumſtances, which perhaps do not belong to the Object, they are frequently very ſucceſsful in rendering Things apparently ridiculous, which to an attentive Eye may not wear the motly Livery, however it may ſerve the Purpoſes of Mirth to inveſt it with it. In order to explain more fully what is here inſiſted on, it may not be improper to lay before the Reader a few Inſtances of the <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Burleſque,</hi> which may in ſome Meaſure ſerve to render this Matter ſtill more intelligible and clear.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Fielding</hi>'s Parſon <hi>Adams</hi> in Diſtreſs at an Inn, retires very gravely with a <hi>London</hi> Bookſeller to raiſe Money upon ſome Manuſcript Sermons, I believe the diſſonant Circumſtances in this Caſe ſtrike very forcibly, and our Laughter is ſtill urged with greater Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, when, after having travelled a great many Miles from his own Place of Abode towards <hi>London,</hi> with no other Buſineſs upon Earth, but to diſpoſe of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, we hear the Parſon not being able to find them, very gravely ſay, <q>I proteſt I believe I left them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me.</q> When the ſame Perſonage aſſures us, that he is very rich, and then adds, that he does not ſay it by way of boaſting or complying with worldly Vanity, but to ſhew that he can live well on the Road, and, to confirm this, produces half a Guinea, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between his Opinion and the ſmall Value of the Piece, and this too from a Clergyman, a Scholar, and in many Things a Man of excellent Underſtanding, produces an Emotion of Laughter attended in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with a Contempt for <hi>Adams</hi>'s Want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World. In like manner, when <hi>Don Quixote</hi> very gravely ſays, that he has ſeen the Sea, and that it is much larger than the River at <hi>La Mancha,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help laughing at a Man who has formed his Ideas of Things by what he has ſeen at his own native Place, and to find an inſigniſicant River compared to the Sea,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0311400902:288"/>preſents ſuch a repugnant Conjunction of Images, as muſt neceſſarily operate upon our riſible Faculties.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Inſtances, which have firſt, among a Thouſand, offered themſelves to my Memory, are true Inſtances of the <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> nothing here being obtruded upon our Imaginations; but in <hi>Burleſque</hi> there are many adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ideas called up, in order to form a motly Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of thwarting Images, and ſo produce the ſame Effect with the really <hi>Ridiculous.</hi> As for Inſtance, if any Object which comes before the <hi>Burleſque</hi> Writer, be low in its own Nature, he immediately bethinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of conferring on it a mock Dignity, in which it begins to look big, like the Champion at a Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who boldly challenges all Mankind when he knows no Body will fight him. I have ever been highly pleaſed with a Touch of this Kind in a Note to Mr. <hi>Fielding</hi>'s <hi>Tom Thumb,</hi> where mentioning ſomething of the Soul of Man, he gravely tells us, <q>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> is of this Opinion, and ſo is Mr. <hi>Banks.</hi>
                     </q> The Stroke in the <hi>Beggar</hi>'s <hi>Opera</hi> is of the ſame Nature —<q>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo moving as a great Man in Diſtreſs.</q> In this Caſe the great Diſproportion between the two Objects ſtrikes our Imagination, and our Laughter burſts out at that which is, without Foundation, ſet in Competition. In the following Paſſage of the Poet, it ſeems to me, there is a ridiculous Appearance intended by giving a mock Majeſty to an Object in the general Opinion not ſo highly exalted.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Oh! could I view thro'</hi> London <hi>as I paſs</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Some broad Sir</hi> Balaam <hi>in</hi> Corinthian <hi>Braſs!</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>High on a</hi> Pedeſtal, <hi>ye Freemen place</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>His magiſterial Paunch and griping Face.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Letter'd and gilt let him</hi> adorn <hi>Cheapſide,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>And grant the</hi> Tradeſman, <hi>what a</hi> King's <hi>deny'd.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus the ludicrous Aſſemblage is formed by an Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Ideas, which we are diverted to ſee joined
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0311400902:289"/>together. The other Method of <hi>Burleſque</hi> is, if an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has any Thing reſpectable about it, to join it with Images, not only inferior, but in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is very frequent in this Kind of Satyr throughout his <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and <hi>Boileau</hi> is, I think, admirable in both Species of <hi>Burleſque,</hi> in his <hi>Lutrin.</hi> Our own <hi>Garth</hi> alſo has many beautiful Paſſages in his <hi>Diſpenſary,</hi> where a Ridicule is thrown upon his Heroes by aſſociating with them Images of Things, to which ſome Kind of Turpitude is adherent; thus a Set of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> quarrelling among themſelves are finely placed in a ludicrous Light by the following humourous Simile.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Thus often at the</hi> Temple <hi>Stairs we've ſeen</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Two</hi> Tritons <hi>of a rough athletic Mien,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Sourly diſpate ſome Quarrel of the Flood,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>With Knuckles bruis'd, and Face beſmear'd with Blood;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>But at the firſt Appearance of a Fare,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Both quit the Fray, and to their Oars repair.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Another very common Method of <hi>Burleſque</hi> is by making frequent Application of grand and ſublime Paſſages in our beſt Poets to Things unworthy and mean. <hi>Bioleau</hi> is, in my Opinion, the happieſt of all modern Poets in this Particular. As Paſſages of this Nature are frequently miſtaken for an Intent to <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque</hi> the Author, from whom the Image is borrowed, it may not be improper in this Place to obſerve, that Parody does not always carry with it any Sneer at the Author parodied. The beſt Lines in <hi>Virgil</hi> may be aptly applied to other Objects, without his being burleſqued, and we find that <hi>Vida</hi> in his elegant and beautiful Poem on the <hi>Game of Cheſs,</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every Line ſurprized us with Expreſſions from the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> by which means he gives Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life to his Poem, animates his imaginary War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours with human Paſſions, and fills the Fancy with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Ideas of mock heroic Majeſty. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0311400902:290"/>of the Havock at a Game of Cheſs is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly elegant.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Sternitur omne ſolum buxo atque miſerrima caedes</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Exoritur; confuſa inter ſeſe agmina caedunt,</hi>

                        </l>
                     </q> The Deſcription of the Queen is alſo highly beautiful.
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>At medias inter acies crudeſcit Amazon.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Candida, plena animis, mediiſque in millibus ardet.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> It is plain, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> in his Account of a Game at Cards in the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> has imitated this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poet in his Manner of exalting inanimate Things, which can never carry with it any Air of <hi>Burleſque,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing can be ridiculous, but when a free Agency is applied.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Burleſque,</hi> as in every other Kind of Writing, Truth ſhould be the Foundation, otherwiſe the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure muſt fall, like <hi>Ariſiophanes</hi>'s Ridicule of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which is now held in Contempt, as will always be the Caſe with every Piece of ill-founded Pleaſantry; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Object thus attacked muſt be always excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, otherwiſe it can never be eſſentially hurt by a falſe Combination of adventitious Ideas. As there is a ſtrong Propenſity in the Generality of People to this Kind of Humour, Tragic Poets, in particular, ſhould be cautious how, by any Paſſage or Expreſſion, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ludicrous Images. If once in the moſt ſerious Scene a wrong Aſſociation of Ideas be formed, the Mind is apt to attach itſelf to the Object of its Mirth, and thus a well-imagined Plece may be obſtructed. A very elegant Critic obſerves, that the following Line of <hi>Dryden.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>A Star light Morning, and an Ev'ning fair.</hi>
                     </q> Has in it nothing improper, and yet, if any one recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects that a <hi>Star-light Morning</hi> is the Language of a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0311400902:291"/>Watchman it may occaſion ſome ſprightly Raillery. On this account, in all the different ſpecies of Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the Writer muſt carefully remember to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his proper Boundaries, becauſe the leaſt Excurſion too far may be highly prejudicial, and give room to ſmall Wits either to point incongruous Circumſtances, or to obtrude them upon the Reader's Imagination.</p>

                  <p>THE Account which I gave lately of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to abdicate the Office of a public Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, has been the Occaſion of my receiving ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from ſundry Correſpondents, who have addreſſed me in a Stile reſponſive to their reſpective Feelings on the Occaſion. A great many Coffeehouſes expreſs their Satisfaction at the Thoughts of being eaſed of the weekly Expence of Two-pence, which my Lucubrations coſt them; a few of theſe hoſpitable Gentry declare themſelves ſorry for my approaching Silence, the <hi>Grays Inn Journal</hi> being, as they aſſure me, the Life of their Coffee-Room. There are many Perſons of ſuch cool and ſerious Underſtandings, that they cannot approve any Thing but what is ſtrictly and literally true; theſe, an ingenious Friend of mine calls, Matter of Fact Men, and by one of this Claſs I am told in very plain Terms, that he's glad I am going to lay down, <hi>a Pox on your true Intelligence; there's never any thing of Conſequence in it; the grand Mogul may be dead; the</hi> Algerines <hi>may make Peace; the King of the</hi> Romans <hi>may be choſen;</hi> Dunkirk <hi>may be refitted;</hi> Theodore <hi>King of</hi> Corſica <hi>be held to Bail, and Mr.</hi> Keen <hi>may ſucceed in his Negociations without any body's being the wiſer for you.</hi> A Perſon, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorms me that he is perfectly vers'd in the Secret of Authorſhip, begs of me to recommend him to my Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0311400902:292"/>that he may carry on the Paper the enſuing Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but in this Point, I muſt deſire to be excuſed, as I ſhould not chuſe to have my Plan eked out beyond its proper Bounds, and I therefore take this Opportunity to entreat that elegant Writer, who has for ſome Time paſt aſſumed the Name of <hi>Ranger,</hi> not to lay any of his Foundlings at my Door, when once I ſhall have made my Bow to the Public. Such a Procedure would be highly illiberal, and I hope I need not ſay any thing further on this Head. But to the ſoft, the obliging, the lovely, the courtly, the amiable <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> who calls me, you agreeable Devil, and you pleaſant Creature you muſt go on; what Anſwer ſhall I make? The Honour of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part every <hi>Saturday</hi>-morning of a Fair one's Tea-Equipage has certainly very powerful Inſtigations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. But the Truth of it is, my Muſe and I have been like Man and Wife for ſome Time paſt, our Affections are become extremely frigid, and I have had ſo many Curtain Lectures from her, that I long very earneſtly to keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Beds, to ſay a civil Thing to her once in a Year, and, like a true modern Huſband, to admire every Body's <hi>Muſe</hi> better than my own, even though ſhe be but a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Drab; and though the World ſhould agree, that my <hi>Thalia</hi> is not entirely contemptible. On this Account, I am at preſent ſuing in the Court of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and as ſhe has not brought me any Fortune to ſpeak of, I ſhall not be troubled to allow her a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Maintenance. I am aware that malicious Critics will give out, that I was ſeparated <hi>cauſâ frigiditatis;</hi> but, the Public is always equitable in its Deciſions, and to them I implicitly ſubmit.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a general Complaint made by my fair Countrywomen, that the Gentlemen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of that Reſpect and Attention which are at all Times due to their Charms, ſhew a great Averſeneſs to their Company. I fear this Charge cannot be controverted, and am ſorry to ſee the Truth maniſeſted in the conſtrained Deportment, in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Addreſs, and uncouth Attempts at Politeneſs, that almoſt univerſally characterize the Youth of this Iſland.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that a frequent, liberal Intercourſe with that more refined Part of our Species, which is happily deſcribed by the Appellation of the <hi>Beau Sex,</hi> ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully influences, not only our Manner and Behaviour, but our Way of thinking, that from thence we acquire a certain Delicacy of Sentiment, which extends itſelf even to the moſt minute Circumſtances of Life. And from hence it is, that our Neighbours, the <hi>French,</hi> have eſtabliſhed throughout <hi>Europe</hi> that Character of Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we do not chuſe to be at the Trouble of emulating, as we find it much more eaſy to ridicule and laugh at it. My Lord <hi>Anglois,</hi> while the Profuſion, with which he diſperſes his Guineas, creates Aſtoniſhment in the Mechanics of <hi>Paris,</hi> conſcious of a Deſiciency in that Eaſe and elegant Freedom, which he obſerves in every Man of Education whom he meets, ſhuns all good Company; and after reluctantly ſpending three Months between the <hi>Hôtel</hi> and the ſeveral Places of public Diverſion, returns to his native Soil, ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0311400902:294"/>with the moſt contemptuous Idea of the <hi>French,</hi> whom, though he has but literally ſeen, he takes the Liberty to deſcribe as a ſuperficial, volatile Nation, for no other Reaſon perhaps, than that they are perfectly ſkilled in the moſt entertaining, I had almoſt ſaid, uſeful Art, that Invention can ſuggeſt, which is, to triſle agreeably.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Frenchman</hi> has no more Idea of a Party of Pleaſure, without Ladies, than an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can entertain the leaſt Conception of enjoying himſelf, until they retreat. From thoſe oppoſite Diſpoſitions it ariſes, that the firſt introduces himſelf with a becoming Unconcern into Company, and Maſter of that <hi>Bienſeance,</hi> which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the Gentleman, and performs all Offices of Life, without the leaſt Embaraſſment: Whereas nothing is more common among us, than to find Gentlemen of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Fortune, who know nothing of the Fair-Sex, but what they have collected from the moſt abandoned Part of it, and can ſcarce reckon a virtuous Family, within the whole Scope of their Acquaintance. It is not unpleaſant to obſerve one of this Claſs, when Chance or Neceſſity has brought him into a Room with Ladies of Reputation. An aukward Reſtraint hangs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and he is almoſt afraid to ſpeak, leaſt he ſhould inadvertently bolt out ſomething, which, tho' extremely ſuitable to the Dialect of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> would be groſly offenſive to thoſe Females, who had not received their Rudiments of Education in that Seminary. The Gloom that hangs over an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, while the Ladies remain, and the reciprocal Reſtraint, that each Sex ſeems to be upon the other, has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Subject of ludicrous Obſervations to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and indeed, the Fair-ones themſelves, <hi>tho' Natives, and to the Manner born,</hi> frequently expreſs Aſtoniſhment, what Myſteries the Men can have to celebrate, ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to thoſe of the <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> that no Female muſt be preſent at the Ceremony. I am not at Liberty to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0311400902:295"/>this important Secret, but will, for the Satisfaction of the Ladies, aſſure them, that they are not of a Nature vaſtly beyond their Apprehenſion; nay, on the contrary, may be caſily underſtood, even by a Miſs in Hanging-Sleeves, provided ſhe has had the Happineſs of a Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-School Education.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time, that I condemn my Countrymen for ſeparating themſelves from thoſe, who have the Art of refining every Joy this World affords, I am ſorry to be obliged to obſerve, that the Ladies themſelves do, in ſome Meaſure, contribute to this great Evil. The ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcus Practice, ſo prevalent at preſent, of giving up their whole Thoughts, as well as Time, to Cards, has made the Company of Women, pardon the Expreſſion, extremely inſipid to thoſe, who would willingly conſider them as rational Creatures, and do not depend upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Skill in the Game of Whiſt for a Subſiſtance. Is it to be imagined, that a Man, whoſe Mind is the leaſt raiſed above the Vulgar, will devote that Time, which he may employ in converſing agreeably either with the Dead or the Living, to thoſe Aſſemblies, where no Ideas enter beyond the reſpective Excellencies of <hi>Garrick</hi> and <hi>Barry,</hi> and the ſeveral poſſible Caſes, ſo profoundly calculated by the incomparable Mr. <hi>Hoyle?</hi> Yet from declining theſe Places, I know many intimate Friends, who have acquired the odious Character of Women-haters, tho' at the ſame Time, they entertain the higheſt Eſteem for that amiable Sex, and ſincerely regret, that the Tyrant Faſhion has put it out of their Power to enjoy more of their Company, than a bare View of their Perſons, agitated by the various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Revolutions of Fortune's Wheel.</p>
                  <p>Beſides what I have already mentioned, another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, extremely pernicious to Society, proceeds from the exceſſive Officiouſneſs of the female World in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Matches. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has obſerved, that <hi>every Women is at Heart a Rake,</hi> and I believe it is not leſs
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0311400902:296"/>true, though I fear the Aſſertion will be much more offenſive to the Virgins of <hi>Britain,</hi> that <hi>every Woman is a Fortune-hunter.</hi> This Character is deſervedly infamous in the male Part of the Creation, and we deteſt the Man, <hi>though of an exceeding good Family in</hi> Ireland, who, aided by the Friendſhip and Confidence of his Taylor, makes a pompous Diſplay of the Breadth of his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Firmneſs of his Calves; but conceive no Indignation againſt the lovely Nymph, who <hi>undreſſes</hi> herſelf, in the ſame View, with the moſt ſeducing Art, and generouſly, much too generouſly, for her own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt! exhibits every Charm the happy Man will be poſſeſſed of, who takes her to his Poſom. The Idea of entrapping ſomebody mixes ſo intimately with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Caſt of Thought in Women, that they can never diveſt themſelves of it, and if a Gentleman pays that Compliment to their Beauty, which female Pride would never Pardon, if he had omitted, they immediately flatter themſelves, that he muſt have a Deſign of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. This Notion once conceived, a Convocation of Aunts, old Maids, diſcreet Friends, prudent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is aſſembled, when every Circumſtance muſt be diſcuſſed.—Miſs intimates—<q>He is very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to me—what can he mean?—He looked at me all the Time he was here—Sure he'll propoſe ſoon—Then did you remark, Aunt <hi>Betty,</hi> when we talked of Marriage, what he ſaid?—He certainly means to have me</q>—The Reſult of this Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that Miſs muſt carry it with a proper Reſerve, in order to compel the imaginary Lover to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, if he be a Man of Experience in the Subtleties of Women, inſtantly ſees through the flimſy Artifice, and diſcontinues his Viſits. I ſubmit to the Candor of every female Reader, whether I have here drawn an ideal Picture.—Can theſe angelic Beings reaſonably expect then, that a Man will chuſe to viſit them, under the diſagreeable alternative of behaving continually
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0311400902:297"/>with a ceremonious Diſtance, or running the Riſk of being driven to the Neceſſity of an aukward Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?—No; while narrow Sentiments of this Kind prevail, it will be impoſſible to introduce a truly ſocial Converſe between the Sexes, which muſt be effected, on the Part of the Ladies, by an undeſigning decent Freedom, the inſeparable Companion of real Virtue. —Let them aſſert their own Dignity, and manifeſt a Conſciouſneſs, that they were not created merely to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> umental in the Continuation of the Species, but are endowed with intellectual Faculties, that qualify them for the ſweet Joys of Society. Let them at length ſo far undeceive themſelves, as to think, that a Man may like their Company, admire their Virtues, nay, even their perſonal Charms, and cheriſh the warmeſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for them, without any Intention of addreſſing them on the Score of Love; let them but offer this Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the natural Vanity of their Sex, and I will undertake to promiſe, that they will not long have Reaſon to complain of being neglected.—Men of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THE Gentlemen here are greatly concerned at the Thoughts of loſing you, both on Account of the Pleaſure they will be deprived of by the Diſcontinuance of your Paper, and of the perpetual Impertinence they will be ſubject to from Mr. <hi>Shortcough,</hi> who, ſince you firſt gave him a Touch of your Pen, has been reſtrained, by his Fears of another Laſhing, within ſome Sort of Bounds; but ſince you have declared your Intentions of relinquiſhing your Paper, he has tranſgreſſed all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0311400902:298"/>and is every Inſtant committing Cutrages againſt Good-breeding and Manners. Since you firſt mentioned him, he has never troubled us at making a Bet when the Odds are in his Favour, with ſaying, <q>Come, I've a Guinea in my Pocket, which my Wife knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of.</q>—But he is now returned to his Vomit: <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Meanneſs</hi> are ſurprizingly blended in him, and theſe two oppoſite Qualities diſcloſe themſelves daily by a vain Ambition of being thought rich, and a Poverty of Spirit in doing the loweſt Actions. Though a Pack of Cards will not at any Ale-houſe fetch more than a Groat, Mr. <hi>Shortcough</hi> will ſlily ſlip one into his Pocket. He inceſſantly offers Bets, but never makes any unleſs he meets with a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> that gives him the Advantage of Four-pence in the Shilling. It is common, by way of ſhewing him off, to give him a Shilling to lay Half a Guinea, and chuſe his Side; and when he has <hi>five Love,</hi> he has made an even Bet with a Gentleman, who offered it to him in Deriſion. In his Converſation he is elegant beyond Deſcription, and his Phraſes are greatly above any Paſſage in <hi>Swift</hi>'s polite Converſation. <q>You Son of a B—h;—you Dog;—you Raſcal;— you hubble bubble-pated Puppy;—hang yourſelf, and drown your Baſtards;—Oh! my God, quoth <hi>Nanny Sayer,</hi> what a Whore am I!—Fatal FOUR, all the World O'ER;—you, Mr. <hi>Quibus,</hi> you may kiſs my—Nominativo; Quibus, Quobus, Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus; and ſo forth.</q> With this Sort of Literature does he infeſt the Company the whole Evening, and it is uſhered in with a ſtentorial Voice enough to crack the Ceiling.—His Age protects him from the Correction of the Arm, but ſurely cannot exempt him from the coercive Power of a Satyriſt. Pray, Mr. <hi>Ranger,</hi> pick ſuch a Rod out of this Bundle as may hercaſter be hung up here <hi>in terrorem,</hi> and you'll oblige, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, Gentlemen of the Jury, that a more groſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was never offer'd to the Republick of Letters, than for a Bookſeller, whoſe Sign is juſtly <hi>emblematical</hi> of his Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> to take upon him to dictate to the Public in a Work, conducted by obſcure
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0311400902:301"/>Hirelings, Country Schoolmaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certain it is that a critical Performance, under the Direction of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Scholars, written with Taſte, Impartiality, and Erudition might be highly ſerviceable to the Cauſe of Literature. A Man, for Inſtance, who ſhould give ſuch an Account of Works of Taſte, as <hi>Pere Brumoy</hi> has of the <hi>Greek</hi> Dramatic Poets, would deſerve to be cheriſhed by the Public, and the Bookſeller, who ſhould publiſh ſuch a Performance would acquire Honour and Reputation in his Buſineſs. But as Matters have been managed by the <hi>Reviewers,</hi> it is manifeſt that the whole is a mere Job, eternally ſwelled out with dull Extracts from dull Authors, calculated to ſerve the Purpoſes of a few Publiſhers, and to miſguide the Public Taſte. The frequent Abuſes of the Liturgy, the Arguments for abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, and the ſcandalous Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many Clergymen of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are ſtrong Indications of the Hand of a Fanatic; and the idle Strictures of natural Hiſtory, Foſſils, Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are infallible Marks of a certain exploded Herbaliſt, who has reduced himſelf to the lamentable Situation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by a great Genius, when he ſays there is not a more miſerable Figure than a Man who has wrote himſelf down. It is therefore ſubmitted to the common Senſe of Mankind, whether it is not the higheſt Preſumption in a Set of Hirelings to impoſe on the Judgment of their unfortunate Readers by a groſs Miſrepreſentation of all Compoſitions, according as they are directed by a Spirit of Malevolence or Partiality; to uſurp the Seat of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm without declaring who and what they are, without producing their Credentials, to ſhew the World by what Authority they act, and without previouſly giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Proofs of their own Ability and Taſte, according to the Statute of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is not a more favourite, or a more trite Subject, of Declamation, than the Degeneracy of the Times. Each Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual of Society, charitably judging himſelf excepted from the general Reproach, aſſumes a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to inveigh againſt the Vices of the Age, and the total Decline from thoſe Virtues, which immortalized the exalted Characters of Antiquity, and enabled the Anceſtors of the preſent Race of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> to deliver down to Poſterity a Conſtitution, which ſtill renders them the Envy of the World.</p>
                  <p>This ſplenetic Humour of decrying the Moderns, is become ſo univerſal, that all Ranks and Orders of Men, ſeem more or leſs infected by it. The Divine patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally bewails the ſhameful Neglect of Religion. The Patriot laments, that Venality and Corruption have irretrievably extinguiſhed the genuine Spirit of Liberty. The Philoſopher ſighs, that Enthuſiaſm and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould have uſurped the Throne of free Enquiry, and debaſed the intellectual Faculties The Fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that the diſſolute Inclinations of the Men compel them to drag out an uncomfortable Life in Celibacy; while the Men, in their Turn, pour out the moſt bitter Invectives againſt the Extravagance and Diſſipation of the other Sex, which, they would have the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are riſen to ſuch an Exceſs, that the Word Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0311400902:307"/>carries with it the Idea of Bankruptcy and Ruin. Nay ſo far has the Influence of this Infatuation reached, that it is become very common for even Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobbers to aſſert, <q>that Things are not now, as they have been—nothing is to be done now—the Prokerage in and out runs away with all the Profit; whereas, in King <hi>William</hi>'s Time, when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was diſtreſſed for Money, and neceſſitated to give ſix <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon a Loan, great Strokes were to be made.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order, therefore, to ſhew the Unreaſonableneſs, as well as Diſingenuity, of this epidemic Diſſatisfaction with the Age, in which I had the Happineſs to be born, I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate, and, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall be able to do it, beyond all Poſſibility of Doubt, that the now exining Inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſo far from being inferior to their illuſtrious Predeceſſors, do at this Day ſurpaſs the Ancients in all the admired Virtues and Qualifications, which the moſt enthuſiaſtic Idolizer of Antiquity ſhall be able to point out.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Place, <hi>Socrates, Plato, Cicero,</hi> and ſome few others of remote Antiquity, are frequently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for that amazing Strength of Mind, which enabled them to detect the Impoſtures of the Religion, eſtabliſhed in the Country where they were born, and empowered them to break through the Impediments, which Superſtition and Prieſtcraſt had placed in the Avenues to Truth. But ſurely the inſignificant Number of Inſtances, that ancient Hiſtory furniſhes, of thoſe truly-philoſophic Characters, however, reſpectable the Names may be, will little deſerve our Attention, when we conſider how infinitely the preſent Age eclipſes their Claim of Superiority, in this Reſpect. Is there a Gentleman at this Day, any Way converſant in polite Life, who does not entertain the greateſt Contempt for the Prejudices, or Faith (as it is vulgarly called.) in which he was educated? Are not the Coffee-houſes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0311400902:308"/>about <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> nay, even in the City, ſo many Seminaries, where our Youth diſcuſs the moſt important Queſtions of Philoſophy, and explode the Errors im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on Mankind for ſo many Centuries? Nor is this Knowledge, as among the Ancients, the Reſult of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Enquiry and Meditation, but entirely intuitive, being moſt eminent in thoſe, who are almoſt totally void of the leaſt Acquiſition in any Branch of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and indebted to Nature alone for their aſtoniſhing Diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>The Advocate for Antiquity will, perhaps, thunder out an Eulogium on the exalted Virtue and Patriotiſm of <hi>Cato, Brutus,</hi> and ſeveral other illuſtrious <hi>Romans,</hi> who, prodigal of Life, diſdained to ſurvive the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Country. But certainly there can be no room to run a Parallel, the Advantage is ſo obviouſly on the Side of the Moderns. Thoſe ingenious Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the Daily News-Writers, in every Page of their Works afford us Examples of the nobleſt Diſregard of Death. The <hi>Roman</hi> voluntarily quits the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not bear to be a Witneſs of the Slavery of his Country; but, the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> puts a Period to his Exiſtence, becauſe the Fogs of <hi>November</hi> depreſs his Spirits, and he ſcorns to be compelled to live longer, than Life continues agreeable. How noble is this Spirit of Freedom! which is not confined to People of Birth and Education, but extends itſelf to the loweſt Mechanics, inſomuch, that my Lord is not more ready to diſcharge a Piſtol through his Brain, than his Barber. In ſhort, the Point is ſo extremely clear, that it would be quite ſuperfluous to labour at the Proof of it, and I may venture to aſſert, that no Nation, of which Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory has preſerved the leaſt Record, has any Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to diſpute the Glory of Suicide with <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am aware, that great Streſs may be laid upon the literary Merit of the Ancients, and expect to hear the Names of <hi>Ariſtotle, Longinus</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> thrown
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0311400902:309"/>out, with an exulting Air of Triumph. Far be it from me, to attempt to derogate from the long eſtabliſhed Fame of thoſe great Men. Undoubtedly, they were very good Critics for the Times, in which they lived; but with all due Reſpect to thoſe celebrated Geniuſſes, we may take the Liberty to ſuppoſe, that the Art of Criticiſm muſt be now much better underſtood, than it poſſibly could be in their Days, as it is much more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſtudied. Attorneys Clerks, Mercers 'Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and Merchants Book-keepers in this Year 1754, <hi>credite poſteri</hi> are thoroughly qualified to pronounce, in the moſt deciſive Manner, upon the Merit of all literary Compoſitions, particularly dramatic Poetry, the nobleſt Province of polite Learning; not to mention, that we have found out the Abſurdity, and ſhook off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, of thoſe Fetters, which the Stagyrite would rivet on us, and transferred them to our Gallic Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, a Nation inured to, and patient of, Slavery.</p>
                  <p>Should any diſcontented, or diſappointed Politician, after poring over <hi>Livy,</hi> inſinuate, that Mankind are not now, as they were in the Times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, when private Conſiderations always gave Way to the publick Good, I would only deſire ſuch a phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Murmurer to look through the Kingdom, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a Number of Gentlemen have impaired their Eſtates, and deſtroyed the Tranquillity and Happineſs of their Families, in order to procure a Seat in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative-Aſſembly of the Nation: undoubtedly with no other View, but that they might be watchful over the Liberties of their Country.</p>
                  <p>Some mercantile Cynic, diſſatisfied with an unruly Son, who finds more Charms within the Regions of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> than the Counting-Houſe, will perhaps pay little Regard to what I have hitherto advanced, and exclaim, <q>that the Spirit of Induſtry is quite loſt, and People of this Age regard nothing but Pleaſure.</q>— But the Injudice of this Cenſure would evidently appear
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0311400902:310"/>to this narrow-minded Citizen, if, the next Time he went to the Pit at <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> with his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on a <hi>Saturday,</hi> he would take the Trouble to make Enquiry, concerning the moſt gay and brilliant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages in the Boxes. He could then be informed, that they are Gentlemen, by Way of Eminence, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the Appellation of <hi>Knights of Induſtry,</hi> who, without any viſible Means of Subſiſtence, enjoy all the Pleaſures of this Metropolis, in the moſt elegant Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and run into Expences, which few Men of <hi>real</hi> Fortune can ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Let us now turn our View to the amiable Sex, and enter into a Compariſon between the Females of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times and the preſent Ladies of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> In what an honourable Light will our Country-Women appear? In vain ſhall the Pedant, who derives his Knowledge ſolely from Books, harangue upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Attachment of <hi>Roman</hi> Matrons, while we can mention numberleſs <hi>Britiſh</hi> Wives, who, at this Day, with unexampled Unanimity, go Hand in Hand with their Huſbands, in purſuit of the grand Buſineſs of Life; mean GAMING; which Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in his uſual emphatic Manner, calls <hi>the Nation's laſt great Trade.</hi> Nor ſhould the Candor and Diſintereſtedneſs of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of this Iſland want that Encomium, which Juſtice cannot refuſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> inſorms us, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Spartan</hi> Nymphs to appear at the public Exerciſes, in Garments, made with artificial Openings, in different Parts, in order that the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Youth might be captivated, by a ſeemingly accidental Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Charms. But our Fair ones, diſdaining ſo diſingenuous a Proceeding, and ſcorning to take Advantage of the Illuſion of Imagination, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by a tranſient Glympſe, is apt to form enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic Ideas of hidden Beauty, <hi>ſhew Things as they really are,</hi> and by making a generous Diſplay of all their Charms, leave no room to their future Huſbands, to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0311400902:311"/>complain, that they were deceived in their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Examples, which I have brought in ſupport of the Propoſition, I undertook to prove, will ſufficiently evince to every impartial Mind, that the pretended Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> over <hi>Britain,</hi> has no other Foundation, than Prepoſſeſſion and Envy; and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Readers muſt acquieſce in the Truth of the Obſervation, made, with great Inſight into human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the elegant Hiſtorian, from whom I have taken the Motto of this Paper—<hi>We are naturally more ready to do Juſtice to what we hear of than to what we ſee; cotemporary Merit excites our Envy, but that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Times our Veneration: We do not think curſelves eclipſed by the latter, but conſider the former as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I muſt avow that I entirely agree with you, that the Moderns have in every thing greatly exceeded the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Ancients.

But to ſet this Matter in the cleareſt Point of View, I ſhall here draw up a Catalogue of whatever may ſeem to give the Ancients a Claim to our Preference, contraſted with a Liſt of modern Improvements, upon a fair Inſpection of which, I flatter myſelf, the Laurel, will by every impartial Reader be adjudged to the preſent Age.</p>

Without adding any ſupernumerary Articles, I think, it is marifeſt from the above State of the Caſe, that the Moderns can eaſily balance the Scale with the ſo much celebrated Ancients. But the Matter does not reſt here, Mr. <hi>Ranger;</hi> I am convinced we can throw in ſeveral Circumſtances which will greatly entitle us to the Pre-eminence. As for inſtance, I do not find that they had an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> among them; and ſurely the Character of an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> muſt in the Eyes of all Men of Senſe, do very great Honour to the preſent Age, the Tenets of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy being entirely new, and ſuch as were not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by <hi>Plato, Tully, Socrates,</hi> or any of the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers: That happy Diſcovery being reſerved for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, ſo much enlightened, as a great Genius ſays, in all true Philoſophy. Add to this, what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready urged on a ſimilar Occaſion, the Ancients were totally ignorant of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and, I believe, it cannot be denied, but the common Law of <hi>England</hi> is by many Degrees preferable to the Laws of <hi>Solon,</hi> or any other Legiſlator, as it is founded upon the ſure Baſis of common Senſe, intelligible to the meaneſt Capacity, without much Study, and full as eaſy in the Practice as in the Theory. I muſt acknowledge that I have read in <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Salluſt</hi> ſome random Accounts of the Contempt the Candidates had in <hi>Rome</hi> for Money upon all Elections for the Conſulſhip, the Tribuneſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure among them was ſtiled by the ill-natured by the Name of <hi>Ambitus,</hi> and by the rigid among the Moderns Bribery and Corruption; but, to diveſt Things of odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Appellations, the public and benevolent Spirit of our Countrymen at a general Election cannot be parallelled any where in the <hi>Roman</hi> Page. The Ancients occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0311400902:316"/>make a Murmur concerning a Matter which they call <hi>nequiſſima faenora,</hi> but it will need no Force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that Uſury has attained to a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Profuſion among the Moderns. How many young Heirs are ruined with us before they come to Years of Diſcretion? Not to mention that they had not the fainteſt Idea of the <hi>Stocks, Jonathan</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, <hi>Change Alley,</hi> the <hi>South-Sea-Houſe,</hi> the <hi>India-Houſe, Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, Directors, Brokers, &amp;c.</hi> That the <hi>Romans</hi> were a very exponſive People, is very well known to Mr. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and every one who has dipped into <hi>Vertot</hi>'s Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the famous <hi>Monteſquieu</hi>'s Cauſes of the Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; notwithſtanding this, I have the Pleaſure to congratulate my Countrymen on our owing ſo many Millions of Money; and I perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, every one of my Readers will allow, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Debt gives us a very great Advantage over the Ancients. I am not ignorant that <hi>Salluſt</hi> mentions <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licè Egeſtatem, privatim Opulentiam, public Penury</hi> and <hi>private Opulence.</hi> But, Sir, I appeal to you whether we have not both theſe more glaringly than appears any where in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory. Tho' I ſhould be ſorry to be guided by a national Partiality in this Matter, yet I cannot but think our <hi>national Debt</hi> is as remarkable a Thing as I ever read of in Hiſtory; and as to private Wealth the infinite Sums of Money laid out in arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Falls of Water, artificial Canals, and indeed in artificial Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moſt evidently evince our Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Moreover, I apprehend, the Ancients were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Strangers to Routs and Drums; not to mention two or three Hundred Card-Tables in one Houſe. I do not think that they ſeem to have the fainteſt Idea of an E. O. Table, of <hi>reverſing,</hi> of <hi>forcing,</hi> of <hi>fineſſing,</hi> of <hi>ſeeſawing,</hi> and the many elegant Turns in the Game of Whiſt. <hi>Picquet, Brag, Backgammon, Cribbidge,</hi> are not even mentioned in the ſlighteſt manner, and, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf I may ſay, without the Danger of a Controverſy, that
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0311400902:317"/>the Diſcoveries made by Mr. <hi>Hoyle</hi> in the Doctrine of <hi>Chances,</hi> by far exceed their deepeſt Reſearches in the Mathematicks.</p>
                        <p>To give the Argument another turn; the Beauty, the Elegance and Manners of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ladies give a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Luſtre to the preſent Age. <hi>Horace</hi> informs us,
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Matronae praeter faciem nil cernere poſſis,</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Caetera, ni Catia eſt, demiſſâ veſte tegentis.</hi>
                              </l>
                           </q> A Matron never ſhews any Part of her Perſon except her Face, they being all ſtudious, unleſs it be <hi>Catia,</hi> to cover the reſt of their amiable bodies with a Garment. <hi>Catia</hi> it ſeems then is a ſingular Inſtance; but how different is the Conduct of the Matrons of the modern Times? They have all happily emerged from the Ruff of Queen <hi>Beſs,</hi> and their chief Endeavour is to diſplay all their Charms to full View. Had this Faſhion prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ancient Ladies, I conceive, a <hi>naked Venus</hi> would not have been ſo great a Rarity. Indeed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſome Remains of this falſe Modeſty prevailed not very long ſince, in conſequence of which Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has finely ſaid,
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>If</hi> Queenſbury <hi>to ſtrip there's no compelling,</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>'Tis from a Handmaid we muſt take an</hi> Helen.</l>
                           </q> But happily future Painters will not be reduced to ſuch Difficulties, as the modern Ladies are daily ſtripping as faſt as they can, and the viſible Approaches of the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sex to a general Nakedneſs cannot fail to give a Luſtre to my fair Countrywomen beyond all <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Fame. The Tendency to undreſſing is ſo ſtrong at preſent, that I make no doubt but the Time will come in a Period not far diſtant, when Miſs in her Teens will cry out, <q>Lard, Mamma, I have been reading the <hi>World</hi> or the <hi>Gray's-Inn Journal,</hi> but they are ſo full of hard cramp Words, I can't think what to make of 'em—Pray, Mamma, what can they mean by Stays?</q> 
                           <q>—Really Child, ſays Mamma, I can't ſay for certain,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0311400902:318"/>but if one may conjecture, I ſhould imagine, that in thoſe Days the Women wore ſomething about their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as high from the Waiſt up as the Pit of their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</q>.—<q>He! he! he! Mamma what a ridiculous Faſhion that muſt be! What has a Woman a fine Skin for but to ſhew it? or if ſhe has not a fine Skin, what has ſhe Paint for but to make a fine Skin? And then Mamma, what could the Petticoat be?</q>—<q>Why Child, it looks as if in thoſe Days they wore a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Limbs down from the Waiſt as low as the Ankle.</q>—<q>He! he! he! ſays Miſs, what has a Woman Legs for but to ſhew 'em? And then Mamma, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by Crown-whiſt that the People in thoſe Days were ſo penurious, and ſo pitiful, and ſo careful as only to play for Crowns?</q>—<q>Yes, Child, ſays Mamma, that is pretty plain, and keeping <hi>Sundays</hi> was then made a Crime, and three Hundred Card-Tables was then counted a Thing of Conſequence</q>—<q>Well, Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, I am as glad as any thing I was not born in thoſe grave, formal Times.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This, or ſomething not unlike it, will moſt aſſuredly be the Language of the riſing Generation, and if Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made in other Branches, ſuch as the <hi>national Debt, Atheiſm, &amp;c.</hi> I perſuade myſelf, that whatever the Admirers of the Antients may urge at preſent, our Superiority will then be inconteſtible.</p>
                        <p>Pleaſed with the Proſpect of this happy Period, I will here lay down my Pen, and ſubſcribe myſelf Mr. <hi>Ranger</hi>'s</p>

                  <p>I dreamt, that, being on board a Merchantman, upon a Voyage, which indiſpenſible Buſineſs obliged me to make, we were drove by Diſtreſs of Weather far to the Southward in the <hi>Great Pacific</hi> Ocean, and that, in the Night-Time, we were ſuddenly thrown on the Shore of an Iſland totally unknown to the Ship's Crew. While
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0311400902:321"/>they were, next Morning, all Hands at Work to get off the Ship, I adventured farther up into the Country, and had not journeyed far, when I perceived myſelf to be in the Land of the <hi>Houyhnhnms,</hi> mentioned by Capt. <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,</hi> in his Travels, and in a little Time me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I met with the ſame Maſter <hi>Houyhnhnm</hi> with whom that accurate Traveller ſo long converſed. As he had before ſeen one of my Species I was freed from the diſagreeable Circumſtances of being ſtared at, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, in the Manner we do a tall Man or a ſhort Woman in <hi>England.</hi> The Maſter <hi>Houynhnhnm</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately took me into a private Apartment, and began to queſtion me concerning the State of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in particular. He aſked me whether the ſame Vices were ſtill in faſhion among us, and more eſpecially whether that Liſt of Enormities, which <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi> had mentioned to him were ſtill continued in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; ſuch as <hi>Robbing, Stealing, Cheating, Pimping, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing, Flattering, Suborning, Forging, Gaming, Lying, Fauning, Hectoring, Voting, Scribbling, Star-gazing, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, Whoreing, Canting, Libelling, Freethinking,</hi> and the like. I told him they flouriſhed with as much, if not more Vigour, than ever, and that two of them, <hi>viz. Gaming</hi> and <hi>Libelling</hi> encreaſed and gathered Strength every Day; that there are ſeveral in the Metropolis of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> who profeſſedly live by them; that in order to carry on the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Gaming, with Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, there are ſeveral Societies formed, where they meet with a Deſign upon one another's Pockets, which was introductory of another Crime, not mentioned by <hi>Gulliver,</hi> viz. <hi>Suicide;</hi> this I took ſome Pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and then he fetched a deep Groan at the Pride and Arrogance of human Nature. I added, that the <hi>Female Yahoos</hi> amongſt us were all turned abſolute Gameſters, and kept Routs, Drums, Hurricanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Purpoſes of Play. I remember I had a very ſenſible Pleaſure in calling the fair Gameſters by the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0311400902:322"/>Name of <hi>Female Yahoos,</hi> becauſe I really think that Term very aptly appropriated to them, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their native Delicacy, and become a Prey to all the tormenting Paſſions of Gaming. I further informed the Maſter <hi>Houyhnhnm,</hi> that Libelling is now in greater Vogue than ever, and that a Society was formed for that Purpoſe by a Set of Scribblers, who call themſelves <hi>Critical and Monthly Reviewers,</hi> and from their obſcure Haunts attack the Reputation of every Man; whom they diſlike for no Motive, except that ſtrong Antipathy which Dullneſs and Malice always have to Genius and a fair Fame. The worthy <hi>Houyhnhnm</hi> here fetched a ſecond Groan, hurt by a Reflection on the Baſeneſs of human Nature: He then enquired about his former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, Capt. <hi>Gulliver,</hi> and ſaid he looked upon him to be exempt from all the mean fordid Vices of his Species. Whereupon I informed him, that <hi>Gulliver</hi> was only that celebrated Perſon's travelling Name; that in <hi>Europe</hi> he was known by the immortal Name of Doctor <hi>Swift;</hi> as I am particularly fond of the Writings of that great Genius, and never travel without them, I informed the <hi>Houyhnhnm,</hi> that I had his Works in my Cheſt, and if he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to return to the Ship, I would have the Honour of preſenting them to him. This Propoſal was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeable, and in a little Space of Time I came back with that elegant Edition of <hi>Swift</hi>'s Works lately publiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Hawkſworth.</hi> In a few Days he read over the beſt Part of his Works, and was delighted with moſt of them, but more particularly with the faithful Account of the Converſation he formerly had with him, which, he ſaid, was ſet down without the leaſt Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Truth. He added, that the Account prefixed by Mr. <hi>Hawkſworth,</hi> of the Author's Life was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Compoſition. <q>I obſerve, ſaid he, that my old Acquaintance <hi>Gulliver,</hi> or <hi>Swift,</hi> was at once an Inſtance of the Dignity and the Imbecillity of human Nature; and the Writer of his Life, I am perſuaded,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0311400902:323"/>muſt have both a clear Head and a good Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Stile is properly conciſe, and always clear, ſtrong and harmonious, and it is with a very percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Regret that he ſpeaks of the Infirmities of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; he ſeems tenderly to fling them into Shades, to ſoften away every thing unamiable, and to place his good Qualities in the moſt glaring Light.</q> Finding the worthy <hi>Houyhnhnm</hi> to be very much pleaſed with this Performance of Mr. <hi>Hawkſworth,</hi> I made him a Preſent of the <hi>Adventurer</hi> in four Volumes, which he received with a ſeeming Avidity, and chancing to light upon the Eaſtern Story of <hi>Carazan,</hi> the <hi>Merchant of Bagdat,</hi> he confeſſed himſelf delighted with the Moral which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates, and amazed at his Warmth and Sublimity of Imagination.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Houyhnhnm</hi> obſerved, when I preſented the above Books to him, that I dropt a Paper, and in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion haſtily ſnatched it up. This Paper was no other than Mr. <hi>Pons</hi>'s Liſt of the Horſes that run at <hi>New-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> which I was deſirous to conceal from him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing urged to ſhow it, he laughed at the Whimſicalneſs of the Conceit, as he ſuppoſed it to be, and he wondered Mr. <hi>Pons</hi> would ſay the Thing which was not. I aſſur'd him of the Veracity of the Account, and told him, however, incredible it might appear, that <hi>Jockeys</hi> rid Horſes, or <hi>Houyhnhnms,</hi> at full ſpeed for Wagers in many other Places in <hi>England,</hi> and that even the firſt Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would frequently ride their own Horſes, and appear at a great Meeting no better than <hi>Jockeys</hi> and <hi>Grooms.</hi> To convince him further of the great Perfection we have attained in the Management of Horſes, I produced to him <hi>A New Syſtem of Horſemanſhip from the</hi> French <hi>of Monſieur</hi> Bourgela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> He at firſt laughed at the Impracticability of the Scheme, but upon my aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that the whole was ſounded on the juſteſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, he immediately ſent for another <hi>Houyhnhnm,</hi> and ordered me to mount him, in order to ſhew him the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0311400902:324"/>Efficacy of the Rules. In vain I endeavoured to decline it by Apologies for my own Want of Dexterity; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me he bid the <hi>Houyhnhnm</hi> not do me a Miſchief, and I was obliged to vault into the Saddle, where I fixed myſelf upon the <hi>Twiſt, with a proper Graſp or Hold,</hi> and <hi>that too without employing any Strength, but truſting entirely to the Balance of my Body. I employed a quick and feeling Hand,</hi> and then made him advance, go back, turn to the right and leſt according to my own Will and Pleaſure. The Maſter <hi>Houyhnhnm,</hi> was ſurprized to ſee me have ſo abſolute a Command; the <hi>Volte,</hi> the <hi>Demivolte,</hi> the <hi>Gallop,</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Paſſades,</hi> the <hi>Terre-a-Terre,</hi> the <hi>Mezair,</hi> the <hi>Curvet, &amp;c.</hi> were Matters of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, and when I alighted the <hi>Houyhnhnm,</hi> which I rode, declared that ſeveral Times, his Pride being picqued, he attempted to fling me, but that by a quick Turn of the Wriſt, he found his Power totally taken away from him. The Maſter again carried me into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and after expreſſing a due Degree of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>Surely, ſaid he, the Perſon who can thus, in ſo elegant and perſpicuous a Manner, put together a Syſtem of Rules for ſubduing the noble Race of <hi>Houy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hnhnms,</hi> muſt make great Attainments, whenever he turns his Thoughts to other Matters.</q> I anſwered, that his Conjecture was perfectly juſt; that the Author had publiſhed that Performance becauſe Riding is his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Excerciſe, and that it is to be hoped he will ſome Day handle other Topics, with that Taſte and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy with which this Compoſition ſhews he can treat ordinary Things.—<q>No Doubt, ſays the <hi>Huyhnhnm,</hi> when he thus touches on what it ſeems in <hi>England,</hi> is but the common Buſineſs of Life, but he muſt diſplay great Elegance, when he diſcuſſes Matters of more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. I own I ſhould be glad to converſe with him, tho' I conſider him as a kind of Enemy, and I hope he is a ſeafaring Man, that I may have ſome Chance of ſeeing him here one time or other.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0311400902:325"/>hearing the Author was deſigned by Birth, Genius, and Education to ſhine in another Sphere, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd himſelf ſorry, and in Compliance with my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, gave me Leave to return to the Ship, which was by this Time got off the Shore. I therefore kiſſed his Hoof, which he raiſed for me, as he formerly did to <hi>Gulliver,</hi> and after deſiring his Compliments to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Swift</hi>'s <hi>Works,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Syſtem of Horſemanſhip,</hi> he diſmiſſed me with a ſerious Admonition to avoid the Meanneſſes and the ſeveral fordid Vices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature.

We ſailed with a proſperous Wind, and, meeting but few Accidents in our Voyage, in a ſhort Time, arrived at <hi>Graveſend.</hi> My Joy at finding myſelf once more in <hi>Old England</hi> was ſo great, that I expreſſed myſelf in the Language of the Country I came from, and awakened out of my Sleep crying out HOUYHNHNM.</p>

                     <p>This Day CHARLES RANGER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> appeared at the Bar of this Court, upon an Indictment found againſt him, for that he wantonly and indiſcreetly from Time to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0311400902:326"/>Time in his <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn Journal</hi> made too free with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which had not offended him, to the great Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Perſons ſo attacked, and againſt the Statute recorded by <hi>Horace, Sublato jure nocendi, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ranger</hi> objected to ſeveral who were ſummoned to be on the Jury, offering various Reaſons as Occaſion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuch as <hi>Dulneſs, Ignorance, Prejudice, &amp;c.</hi> At length this Point being adjuſted, the Cauſe was opened by Counſellor <hi>Feſter,</hi> who ſpared neither Elocution nor Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to inflame the Mind of the Court, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen impanelled againſt the Priſoner at the Bar. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtances, he inſiſted, could be pointed out of perſonal Reſentment, and Malice prepenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which, ſeveral Paſſages of <hi>Ranger</hi>'s Writings were read in Court, and ſeveral Witneſſes appeared to enforce the Charge exhibited againſt him.—Among theſe were <hi>Quinbus Fleſtrin,</hi> from the <hi>Bedford</hi> Coffee Houſe; <hi>Bob Nankeen, Nat Pigtail, Harry Lappel, Jack Oakſtick, Jem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Scratch,</hi> from the City; Mr. <hi>Mac Gregor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shallow, &amp;c.</hi> from the Robinhood Society; Monſ. <hi>Bourguignon,</hi> Monſ. <hi>Languedoc,</hi> Monſ. <hi>Bernard;</hi> Monſ. <hi>Soup meagre; &amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Tom</hi>'s in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> and <hi>Slaughter</hi>'s in <hi>St. Martin</hi>'s <hi>Lane; Moſes Aminadab, Selim Levi, Rubens Shylock,</hi> &amp;c. from <hi>Dukes-Place;</hi> and ſome others from various Parts of the Town; all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the Priſoner had indulged himſelf in frequent Strokes of Pleaſantry upon them, and they therefore hoped the Jury would bring in a Verdict accordingly.</p>

                        <p>The Imputation of wantonly making free with Characters that had not given any perſonal Offence, is a Point I muſt ſpeak a few Words to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think it a very fallacious Argument, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0311400902:327"/>if it be ſuppoſed to carry any Weight, it may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to tie up the Hands of every Satyriſt. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that a ridiculous Character ſhould tread upon an Author's Toe, or offend him in ſome other Manner; without that, he is free Game for every Sportſman of the Qui'l; and that this is Mr. POPE'S Opinion appears from the following Lines;
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>And muſt no Egg in</hi> Japhet'<hi>s Face be thrown,</hi>
                              </l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Becauſe the Deed he forg'd was not my own?</hi>
                              </l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I muſt farther declare before this honourable Court, that I never ſaw one of theſe Gentlemen, who have appeared againſt me, in my Life.—Their Faces, their Perſons, their Characters, are to me perfectly unknown: and therefore I preſume, it may be fairly inferred, that I never meant to give the leaſt Annoyance to any one in particular—They were all Perſonages of my own Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſomething like them I imagined might exiſt in Nature, and therefore I fanſied I had a Right to laſh or banter any Vice or Folly under imaginary Names, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intending a perſonal Application in any one Inſtance. Having ſaid thus much, I think it unneceſſary in ſo plain a Cafe to take up the Time of the Court, to whoſe equitable Deciſions I implicitly reſign myſelf.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon the Jury withdrew, and in a few Minutes brought in their Verdict NOT GUILTY, to the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of <hi>Ranger</hi> and his Friends, and the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Group of Witneſſes mentioned above. The Lord Chief Juſtice of the Court then broke his Staff, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Commiſſion to be annulled, and the cenſorial Court was finally diſmiſſed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> SPIRIT of Enterprize adminiſters to the Heart, in which its Pulſations are felt, the ſtrongeſt and moſt glowing Pleaſures our Conſtitutions can admit; Doubts and Fears may ariſe, but they are ſoon quenched by ſanguine Hope; Succeſs hovers over the young Schemiſt's Head; Fame ſtands in a Corner of the Picture, which fond Fancy has framed, blowing her immortal Trumpet, and Happineſs and gay Serenity dart in ſprightly Vibrations through his Soul. Happy, were the golden dream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to evaporate! But Clouds ariſe that blot the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Radiance, and as ſoon as the Beams of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are diminiſhed, the Paſſions, like Flowers at the Setting Sun, immediately are contracted, the Spirits, that expanded every Nerve, ſink in their Channels, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide into Languor, and Satiety takes Poſſeſſion of the Mind. I remember, to have met with a Story of a prime Miniſter to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who ſeems to have had a ſhrewd Turn of Humour. When the King happened, in the full Rapture of Expedition, and his Imagination dilated with Ideas of future Conqueſt, to expatiate at large upon the various Incidents of his growing Enterprize: <q>Pray Sir, (ſays he) what does all this tend to? Why, cries the Monarch, I ſhall add the neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to my Dominions.—Well! and what then, pray? Why then I ſhall declare War againſt the adjacent
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0311400902:329"/>States.—And what then, Sir? I ſhall proceed in my Conqueſts, and the next Province ſhall receive my Yoke.—And what then, Sir? Why their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhall alſo pay Tribute — This is very well, my Liege, and what next?—Thus I ſhall gradually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my Victories till I become Maſter of the Globe. —And what then?—Then—why,—then I'll ſit down and crack a Bottle with my Friends— And pray, Sir, why not do ſo now?</q> This Paſſage has always appeared to me to carry with it a very fine Stroke of Satyr, and I am inclinable to think, that if the greateſt Hero of Antiquity, were to make up the Account of his Happineſs, he would find it not one Jot more than is here implied.</p>
                  <p>But among all the various Adventurers who muſt feel this Truth, there is no Set of <hi>Quixotes</hi> who experience it more powerfully than the Race of Authors. What Happineſs does not the periodical Writer enjoy in the firſt dawning of a new Plan?—In Proportion as one Idea awakens a new Train of pleaſing Images, and the Deſign opens to his View, what Senſations unfelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? What Chearfulneſs, what Fancy, what luxuriant Wit? And when a Sheet, yet wet, is ſent him from the Preſs for his Inſpection, how his Heart bounds to ſee himſelf in print!—the Fineneſs of the Paper!— How it pleaſes him! The Elegance of the Type! —How its Symmetry ſtrikes the Eye! The Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Compoſitor!—How juſt and how exact! —Fluſhed with theſe Ideas the Imagination expands itſelf, and in the Fulneſs of Self-Admiration, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf in the Words of <hi>Hamlet</hi>—"What a Piece of Work is Man! How noble in Reaſon! How infinite in Faculties!"—And yet paſs but a few Hours, and how changed is every Trace of Reflection! The Critics gather round him, and, like the Harpies in the third <hi>Aeneid,</hi> they break in upon his Meal, and like them too, they denounce Penury and Famine. The
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0311400902:330"/>Learned meet his work by Chance; they ſpeak of it, but not with ſufficient Warmth, becauſe Men of Senſe never admire, and only approve. He ther runs up and down among the Pamphlet Shops; in many they have not heard of it; he calls for it in Coffee-Houſes, "Sir, we don't take it in"—In Places where it is uſed, he ſees it twiſted into a thouſand different Shapes, the Paper and Print neglected, and the Stile unregarded; the Waiters throw it among the common Lumber, and Gentlemen keep Snuff in it. Theſe, and many other Indignities ariſe to mortify an Author's Pride; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the Novelty of the Performance will wear off with him, as well as his Readers, and even Fame, ſuppoſing the good natured World allow him his full Portion, will thrill by degrees with feebler Impulſe to his Heart-Strings, and in the Concluſion, I believe, he will find, that, Hero like, he cannot drink his Bottle with greater Pleaſure than when he firſt ſet out.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, that there is a Concurrence of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which never ſail to render the Profeſſion of an Author more uneaſy than any other Station in Life.</p>
                  <p>The courtly <hi>Roman</hi> Satyriſt has attacked, with all the elegant Touches of his delicate Raillery, that prevailing Spirit of Uneaſineſs, which renders People diſcontented with their own Situation in Life, and envious of the apparent Felicity of their Neighbours; but in the Lift of Male-Contents, which he has produced, I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wondered, that he has not thought proper to enrol the Race that write. The Occaſion of this might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be, that Authors have more ſolid Reaſons than any other Claſs of Beings, to repine and murmur at their Occupation, and to wiſh that Fate had aſſigned them an Employment, in which they might partake more of the Eaſe and the Enjoyments of Life.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, conſidering the great Diſproportion of Intenſeneſs between the Labours of the Mind, and thoſe of the Body, I do not know whether <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Advice
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0311400902:331"/>to be an Auctioneer rather than a Poet, is not entirely eligible; for it is certain, that thoſe nice Faculties of Perception, of which the literary Enthuſiaſt is poſſeſſed, as they are the Inlets of our moſt refined intellectual Pleaſures, ſo they are alſo, from the Quickneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of their Feeling, ſuſceptible of the moſt acute Degrees of Pain, and in the ſame Proportion that they adminiſter to Happineſs, they may alſo improve and ſharpen the Edge of Miſery; in like Manner as the String, from which the ſkilful Artiſt elicits a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Strain of Muſic, is alſo capable of returning the diſagreeable Sounds of jarring Diſcord.</p>
                  <p>Of this Truth, I believe every Writer is convinced, who is actuated by an honeſt Ambition to acquit himſelf with Honour in his Calling; for I by no Means intend to ſpeak at preſent of thoſe vain Scribblers, who are for ever happy in their own Self Admiration, and who are intirely Strangers to the Agitations of Mind, attendant on a Genius, ſtudious of correcting and poliſhing his Piece. In fine Writing, there are ſo many intricate Points, which demand Attention, that it muſt be with the utmoſt Solicit de the Taſk is ever accompliſhed. Juſtneſs of Conception, and Truth in every Turn of Wit are indiſpenſible Requiſites; nothing can excuſe the Want of Delicacy of Sentiment; the Sallies of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the frolic Gambols of Invention muſt be reſtrained by Severity of Judgment, and all muſt be expreſſed with Perſpicu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty and Strength of Diction. Beſides this, a proper Arrangement of Periods, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another with graceful Variety, muſt unite the whole into Harmony, as the Painters expreſs themſelves, when they give the laſt finiſhing Hand to their colouring, and throw that general Glow upon their Piece, which at the firſt Glance ſtrikes the intelligent Spectator. But the Truth of it is, the Traces of a Mind, which can think with Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arneſs and Vigour upon any Subject, and purſue a Series of Ideas, one emerging from another,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0311400902:332"/>and tending gradually to form an intire whole, are ſo ſeldom diſcovered, that there is Reaſon to think it an Accompliſhment unattainable, without the moſt aſſiduous Efforts of Study, and many Moments of Care and Anxiety.</p>
                  <p>An honeſt and fair Fame is among the Inſtigations, which incite an Author to undergo all this mental Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue; but even that very Inducement is of ſo unſtable a Nature, the Acquiſition of it ſo uncertain, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure ſo precarious, that I believe, what at firſt looked ſo inviting to the Imagination, becomes at length the Writer's greateſt Torment. Add to this, the great Hardſhip of pleaſing that Multiplicity of Appetites, with which Mankind abound, and the ſtill greater Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, which every Man of Genius experiences, to pleaſe his own private Taſte. Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> tells us, in the general Preface to his Works, that he never wrote up to his own Ideas of Poetry; and <hi>Boileau,</hi> who is ſecond to no Man for ſound Senſe and Judgment, obſerves, that an Author of Elevation in his Conceptions, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually diſcontented with his Performances, is pleaſing to all the World, except himſelf, and, while his Wit is every where admired, that, for his own inward Quiet, he ſincerely wiſhes he had never dipt his Pen in Ink.</p>

                  <p>I have been led into this Tract of Thought by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of my own Senſations, ever ſince I undertook the anxious Character of a public Writer, which I have now ſuſtained for the Space of two Years, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſwelled theſe Eſſays to a ſufficient Number, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe next <hi>Saturday</hi> finally to take Leave of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. In doing this, I muſt own, that I perform a kind
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0311400902:333"/>of Self-denial, as I ſhall then break off an habitual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Public, from which I have occaſionally deduced a very ſenſible Pleaſure, as I have experienced that theſe Papers, ſuch as they are, have, from Time to Time, conduced to the Entertainment of the Town.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I am now arrived to the concluſive Eſſay of the <hi>Gray's Inn</hi> Journal, the Maſk muſt be dropped; and the aſſumed Character of the Gay <hi>Charles Ranger</hi> muſt at length dwindle into that of the real Author, who begs Leave this Day to addreſs his Readers in his own Name.</p>
                  <p>I remember the Introductory Paper to this Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embarraſſed my Imagination, more than any ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Compoſition; as coming into Company is ſometimes attended with uneaſy Flutterings, which are afterwards effaced by Habit. As I am alſo deſirous of going off with as good a Grace as poſſible, I cannot but be a little ſolicitous about the Manner of my Exit. In the ſocial Intercourſe of Life, I know as little Ceremony ſhould be uſed, as the Nature of all Things will admit; but the periodical Writer, cannot withdraw, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Bow to the Public.</p>
                  <p>Two different Forms of writing have offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me upon this Occaſion. The firſt has been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by ſeveral Gentlemen of the Quill, and conſiſts in a declamatory Stile againſt that degeneracy of Taſte, which has too fatally prevailed in the preſent Declenſion of Literature. In Addition to this, I might indulge myſelf in a Vein of Invective againſt the general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Gaming, and many other unavailing Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have called off the Attention of the better Sort of People from all literary Productions. I might further expatiate in a Strain of Raillery on the Fair, and might urge, that Woman is very juſtly defined by the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0311400902:336"/>
                     <hi>Greek</hi> Pholoſopher, <hi>"An Animal delighting in Finery,"</hi> and that it is not in the Power of the beſt Writers of the Age, to attract the Attention of that wandering Sex, who are evermore entertained with the Chit-chat, which iſſues from their own pretty red Lips, than with a Peruſal of a Compoſition, calculated to retrench their Follies, to regulate their Fancy, to improve their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, and to encourage them to the Acquiſition of thoſe mental Beauties, ſuch as Sweetneſs of Temper, Affability, and good Senſe, which will be always ſure to confer upon them the moſt permanent Embelliſhments, and will prove the beſt Waſh for the Complexion, and an infallible Preſervative againſt the Encroachments made upon the Tincture of the Skin, by Envy, Malice, Tea, Scandal, and painful Watchings at a Gaming-Table. After this I might pompouſly declare, that I now decline taking any further Trouble with thoſe incorrigible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; that I conſign them entirely to their Hair-Cutters, their Dancing Maſters, and, what is ſtill worſe, to their own ungoverned fantaſtic Appetites. But this Form of Compoſition is inconſiſtent with my preſent Purpoſe, as I ſhould be glad to lay down the Pen in the good Graces of all my Readers.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Method of Addreſs which occurred to me, was that uſed by the excellent and humorous Author of the <hi>Tale of a Tub.</hi> After his Example, I have been tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return Thanks, in the moſt ſolemn Manner, to his Majeſty's moſt honourable Privy-Council, to the Lords ſpiritual and temporal, to the honourable the Houſe of Commons, to the Gentlemen of the Royal Society, to the Worſhipful the Board of Aldermen, to the Club at <hi>White</hi>'s, to the Cricies at the <hi>Bedford,</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no'ſſeurs at <hi>Sam</hi>'s, to the Society of <hi>Grub-ſtrect,</hi> and, in ſhort, to all Degrees and Ranks of People, for the juſt and favourable Reception they have been pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the moſt delectable, humorous, and inſtructive Lucubrations, that we have publiſh'd in this our <hi>Gray</hi>'s <hi>Inn
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0311400902:337"/>Journal,</hi> which has been the Delight of the choice Spirits of the Age, the Terror of all Offenders againſt Decency and Good-Manners, and which has aſcertained to the Author an immortal Reputation;

                     </q> But having conſidered this Matter with ſufficient Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I have judged it eligible to decline both the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Writing above exhibited. The Truth of it is, as on the one Hand I am not ſo ſelf-ſufficient as to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to myſelf any extraordinary Pride from the Degree of Succeſs I have met with; ſo on the other, I do not think I can reaſonably find any Fault with the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Public to the preſent Writer. I have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſteered between the two Extremes of partial popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Applauſe, and a general Neglect; and I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no colourable Pretence to expreſs the leaſt Degree of Diſcontent at Parting, nor vain-gloriouſly to exult at the Applauſe, which has been occaſionally allowed to me.</p>
                  <p>I am too ſenſible, that a ſmall Portion of Fame can be attributed to the Productions of a young Author, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down the Stream of Diſſipation, interrupted by Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a thouſand Sorts, ſeldom enabled to write at Leiſure, frequently obliged to diſmiſs the uncorrected Sheet to the Preſs, rarely happy enough to have written up even to his own Taſte, and often checked in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer by the Timidity of an Adventurer, who was always diffident of his own Abilities, and was ſenſible how far ſo young a Writer muſt be from thoſe ſtrong Powers of Mind, which, when matured by Age and Application, animate and embolden Genius, give Authority to Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, add Strength to Compoſitions of a graver Caſt, and inſpire an Author with a due Degree of Confidence
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0311400902:338"/>in his Deciſions, upon all Occurrences in human Life, as likewiſe upon all Topics of Taſte and Erudition.</p>
                  <p>Though unattended with theſe Advantages, it is, however, ſome kind of Satisfaction, that I have been able to procure myſelf an Audience once a Week for two Years together, from perhaps ſeveral Thouſands in <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> and, on this Occaſion, I cannot help taking to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſecret Pleaſure from the Reflection, that I have given a kind of Weekly Memorial of my Exiſtence, and force Sort of Proof, that my Time has not been thrown <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

On the contrary, I think it incumbent on me to acknowledge, that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friend, who muſt be nameleſs, has furniſhed me occaſionally with ſeveral humorous Paragraphs of News, written with a Delicacy of Humour peculiar to himſelf; and, I will add, that I never withdrew from his Converſation, without ſome Hint for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Readers. To this Gentleman I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for a Letter from an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> No. 14; for a Scene at-<hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> No. 19; for an Eſſay on I heatrical Parties, No. 31; for an Eſſay on the modern Faſhion of viſiting, No. 34; for a ſecond Scene at <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, No. 57; and for the Eſſays in 98 and 100. That I have not received more from him, I have often thought it both a Loſs to the <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn Journal</hi> and the Public; as he poſſeſſes an elegant Facility on every Subject, I ſincerely wiſh that I had been able to prevail upon him, againſt his natural Indolence, to afford me a great deal more of his Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>A Paper upon what may be called Imitation in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and an Eſſay towards the fixing the Standard of modern Criticiſm, together with ſome occaſional Strokes of Humour in the true Intelligence, were the Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of another ingenious Gentleman, whoſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I am convinced, would have inclined him to do ſomething toward raiſing the Eſtimation of this Paper much higher, had not Avocations of more Conſequence to himſelf and the Public, demanded the Exertion of his excellent Abilities in another Way.</p>
                  <p>I muſt take this Opportunity to thank the Author of a Letter, occaſioned by my Criticiſm on King <hi>Lear,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0311400902:340"/>Gentleman of a very elegant and lively Fancy. And now and then, in the News there are either Articles ſent by unknown Hands, or Paragraphs raiſed upon their Hints. But of theſe the Number is extremely ſmall; for every Thing elſe <hi>Ranger</hi> himſelf muſt ſtand account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>I have now, I think, faithfully mentioned all the Aſſiſtance I received in the Courſe of this Paper, and upon this Appearance of Matters, I believe, it will be ſound very ſhort of the Advantages enjoyed by ſome of my Brother Writers. I have not had the Happineſs of being puff'd in any of our common News Papers, or in that entertaining and truly uſeful Work, as Mr. <hi>Griffiths</hi> calls the <hi>Monthly Review.</hi> I have never been able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Town with the Writings of People of Faſhion, nor to lay before them an <hi>Eſſay written by a Perſon of Honour;</hi> I could never boaſt the Friendſhip of the Nobility, nor has any Lord ſent me a Paper, and upon Publication bought up a thouſand Copies, to ſhew me how well his own Performances ſell. I muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, own, that I have always exerted my utmoſt Abilities, and have put every thing out of hand with as much Care as the Nature of periodical Productions, the Author's Spirits, and other Circumſtances would permit. I have ever had as great a Reſpect for the Public, as <hi>Tully</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes for a <hi>Roman</hi> Aſſembly, and I agree with him when he ſays, <hi>nihil huc niſi perfectum ingenio, elaboratum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriâ afferri opportere.</hi> At the ſame Time, I hope, it will be conſidered, what Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> obſerves with great Propriety, that the Public ſhould not expect that an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's whole Time ſhould be ſpent in poliſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touching for their Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, why may not a Perſon rather chuſe an Air of bold Negligence, than the obſcure Diligence of Pedants, and Writers of affected Phraſeology? For my Part, I have always thought an eaſy Stile more eligible than a pompous Diction, lifted up by Metaphor, ampliſied
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0311400902:341"/>by Epithet, and digniſied by too frequent Inſertions of the <hi>Latin</hi> Idiom. I am therefore inclined to flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that my Expreſſion has been natural and unambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; and that my Arrangement has been grammatically juſt, unperplexed and clear, and that upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I have written with ſome Degree of Purity.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, if I cannot boaſt of having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced edifying Strains of Morality, Diſſertations of uncontrovertible Criticiſm, and Papers of exquiſite Mirth and Humour, I hope, at leaſt the whole Plan has been conducted with a ſtrict Regard to Decency, and without any Offence againſt Virtue or good Manners. To this Circumſtance, I believe it in a great Meaſure owing, that I have been ſo ſavourably received by the Town; but be the Cauſe, what it may, I ſhall always retain a grateful Senſe of their Indulgence, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Way, hereafter I may endeavour to entertain them, I ſhall think they have a Demand upon me for the moſt vigorous Exertion of my Abilities, and, let my Succeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be as it will, I at leaſt hope I ſhall have Judgment enough not entirely to miſtake my Talents.</p>
                  <p>Having avowed theſe Sentiments I ſhall conclude without any ſtudied flouriſh of Period, and I remain with great Reſpect to all my Readers in particular, and to the Public in general,</p>
