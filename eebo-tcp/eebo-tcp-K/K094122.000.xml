            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the following pages are contained ſome reaſons why the contagious poiſon of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> received into the human body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be extinguiſhed, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by any Antidote, or other means than what nature effects in producing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper. I have alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to explain the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0667300400:3"/>of the propagation and eruption of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> from the practice of <hi>inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and why this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, taken, by common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in the natural way, proves ſo much more fatal than that which is given by <hi>inoculation.</hi>

            <p>The reaſons that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to preſent you with this ſhort account from the preſs, were by no means owing to a conſciouſneſs of my having cleared up theſe matters to any degree of

            <head>Some reaſons why the Contagion of the Small-Pox, received into the human body, cannot be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed or expelled by any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, or other means than what Nature effects in producing the diſtemper.</head>
            <p>THAT moſt celebrated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, the learned <hi>Dr. Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave,</hi> was of opinion that there is to be found out, in Nature, ſuch a kind of medicine as would have the ſpecific power of extinguiſhing, or eradicating the Contagion of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> from a body infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without permitting any erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the puſtules; in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that other poiſons are cured by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0667300400:7"/>peculiar <hi>Antidotes</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Aph. 1390-91-92. et prax. med. V. v.</note>. Some other Phyſicians, alſo, revering the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of this great man, have pretended to ſupport the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>But, as no improvements have yet appeared to have been made, at leaſt nothing material has been advanced, by the advocates for this enquiry, notwithſtanding the Doctor gave his reaſons for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and explained his ſuggeſtions as far as he could, it is probable, therefore, that the unſurmountable obſtacles which have ariſen from the conſideration of this contagious venom, and the different manner of it's operations, have, hitherto, diſcouraged all the attempts that may have been ſince made towards
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0667300400:8"/>the diſcovery. And, indeed, I am inclined to think, that, had the Doctor written on this particular ſubject, after the practice of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation grew to be ſo much uſed in <hi>Europe,</hi> as it now is, he would, from the new diſcovery of the operation of this morbific taint, have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed oppoſite reaſons to an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which, many years ago, he thought uncontrovertable. For ſo conſpicuous in experiment, as this is, could never have eſcaped his ſagacious obſervation; which proves that the leaſt particle of variolous pus, containing the very ſeeds of contagion, by enflaming and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding an external ſolid part, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>a kind of Carbuncle;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the natural operation of this contagious infection is demonſtrated to the greateſt degree of certainty,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0667300400:9"/>and ſilences all <hi>hypothetical</hi> notions of its contaminating the fluids only, by explaining (as I ſhall endeavour to do more hereafter) that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific effluvia of this diſeaſe received by inſpiration, in the ordinary way of infection, by inflaming and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding, in like manner, ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts as are more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſervient to the vital purpoſes, are therefore more likely to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the moſt dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
            <p>The method, however, <hi>given,</hi> for attaining to the knowledge of this diſcovery, is, after the infection of the Small-pox is taken, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent inflammation, ſo that a ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated matter may not enſue: and this is propoſed to be effected, by treating the diſtemper, like other inflammatory caſes, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0667300400:10"/>and giving ſuch correcting medicines, as, by gently diluting and diſſolving the blood, may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off the cauſe by the convenient outlets; and ſo cure the diſeaſe, while in it's firſt ſtate, without coming to ſuppuration.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe the Doctor mentions a preparation of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> brought to a great degree of penetrability, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered intirely deſtitute of all <hi>Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> by diſſolution,  from whence, he ſays, there ariſeth <hi>almoſt</hi> ſuch a kind of medicine, and by which he hath ſeen ſome good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aethiops Mineralis</hi> hath been likewiſe propoſed as a ſpecific medicine, for the ſame intention, by <hi>Dr. Lobb,</hi> who hath given ſome inſtances of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> being,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0667300400:11"/>in his judgment, prevented by the timely uſe of it. But as there have been frequent examples of people eſcaping this diſtemper, who had been ſuppoſed to be in the greateſt danger of taking it; it is not improbable but that ſome of theſe may have been attributed, by miſtake, to ſuch preventive means as had been uſed on thoſe occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr. Cheyne</hi> alſo hath pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the beſt <hi>Antidote</hi> in nature againſt the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> and the <hi>Plague</hi> itſelf, is <hi>Aethiops Mineralis</hi> and <hi>Cinnabaris Antimonii,</hi> taken, made up into boluſes, twice or three times a day, and waſhed down with Orange Whey. Of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of which, he ſays, he has had ſome ſucceſsful experience. For the confluent <hi>Small-pox,</hi> he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0667300400:12"/>adds, is but a miniature of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and both are curable in good habits.</p>
            <p>Many more writers (ſome of which are of great eminence) have touched alſo upon this matter, as the ſentiment of <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> but without preſuming any further; well knowing that an affair of this nature can admit of no alternative, and that it is to no manner of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to pretend to defend by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what cannot be ſufficiently warranted by experience. For ſuch particularities in opinion have been oftentimes ridiculed, in men of learning, as the effects of mere whim and chimera.</p>
            <p>But the character of <hi>Boerhaave</hi> is too ſacred for reflection, as he certainly had no deſign to impoſe on the judgment of others by a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0667300400:13"/>prediction of this ſort, which was grounded, probably, <hi>on ſuch Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations in Chemiſtry</hi> as are not eaſily to be explained on <hi>mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr. Mead</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">De variolis et morbillis.</note>, however, could not paſs over this opinion of his learned friend without wondering how he could be induced to hope that ſome time or other a ſpecific <hi>Antidote</hi> would be found againſt the contagious poiſon of the <hi>Small-pox;</hi> that is, by which it would be ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly deſtroyed, that, tho'it had been received into the body, it could not produce the diſeaſe. For, continues he, the elements of things are ſo certain, and ſo well eſtabliſhed by the permanent laws of Nature; that whoſoever would endeavour to change them, would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0667300400:14"/>act like thoſe Philoſophers <hi>by fire</hi> (as they ſtile themſelves) who labour hard to tranſmute the baſer metals into gold; and when continual diſappointments have convinced them of the vanity of their hopes, actually extract gold out of the purſes of the ignorant and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by the fumes of their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Stack's tranſl. p. 58.</note>.</p>
            <p>In an affair of this kind, it is undoubtedly the ſafeſt and trueſt way to conſult nature herſelf, as a <hi>divine</hi> principle, diffuſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the creation, acting in all bodies by certain properties which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of certain effects. And we may conſider her in a vaſt vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſenſes, as ſhe doth nothing in vain; attempts always to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0667300400:15"/>herſelf; cures all diſeaſes; and acts upon unerring rules in all her ways. Hence we obſerve in Fevers, particularly thoſe of the eruptive kinds, the moſt ſurpriſing commotions and conflicts, which ſerve to throw off the morbific mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by various ways, for the relief of the Patient; and, in theſe caſes, eſpecially, ſhe is to be nicely obſerved, and followed with the greateſt care; becauſe any counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting means would obſtruct her firſt deſign, and make her proceed upon other different principles, which would conſequently beattended with very different effects.</p>
            <p>It ought to be conſidered, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether a ſpecific <hi>antidote</hi> againſt the contagious taint of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> (if ſuch an one were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable) would not be likely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0667300400:16"/>to do more hurt than good, by preventing a diſtemper, which, perhaps, was intended by nature, as <hi>Dr. Gilchriſt</hi> obſerves, for a drain to clear the conſtitution of ſome groſs humours, which, if not carried off in this way, would bring on other diſeaſes. The ſame Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſupports this opinion by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that thoſe Children who had had the Small-pox by inoculation in <hi>Scotland</hi> were uncommonly healthy; which he ſuppoſes to be owing to this cauſe, that the Fever in the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> communicated in the infant ſtate, not only deſtroys or expells the latent ſeeds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, before they are, by time and accidents, perfected, and put into action; but cauſes ſuch an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humours as may make them leſs ſuſceptible of any morbid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0667300400:17"/>impreſſions: And the veſſels being ſo accuſtomed, before they become rigid, to certain motions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, the body is rendered, ever after, more paſſive to the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of any ſubſequent diſtemper. This, he maintains, is agreeable to experience; for one who has ſuffered an acute illneſs will bear ſickneſs better than another, who never had the like diſtemper, and be leſs overcome by it<note n="*" place="bottom">Edinb. Eſſays Phyſ. and Liter. Vol. 2. Art. 30.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls nature the great phyſican; and our judicious <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi> ſays, that a diſeaſe is nothing more than an effort of nature to throw off the morbific matter for the health of the patient; which <hi>Dr. Mead</hi> has obſerved to be no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0667300400:18"/>where more particularly verified than in thoſe envenomed Fevers, in which the violence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper breaks out on the Skin ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the form of <hi>puſtules, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles,</hi> or <hi>bubos.</hi> And hence it ſeems pretty plain that no art can abrogate the law of nature, by the prevention of thoſe kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which happen from contagion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe corpuſcular effluvia of the Small-pox, or particles which fly off from diſtempered bodies, and, mixing with the juices of others, occaſion the ſame diſeaſe, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from a matter differing from all other poiſons, and liable to cauſe inflammation in a greater or leſſer degree, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional ſtate and condition of thoſe that receive them: and ſome miſerable caſes of the <hi>Small-pox</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0667300400:19"/>have ſhewed us inſtances where the whole texture of the blood has been ſo broken and diſſolved, that the <hi>craſſamentum,</hi> after it had ſtood a while to become cold, could but juſt hold together. Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there have been ſome inſtances where this poiſon hath given ſo little diſturbance, as ſcarcely to introduce any perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lentor on the blood, at leaſt not enough to obſtruct it in the capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veſſels: And we have ſeveral times remarked where it has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by inoculation, that if it had not been for it's immediate action on a ſolid part, it would have proved inſufficient even to ſhow the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick marks of the <hi>Small-pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is not altogether improbable but that this contagious venom may operate by various
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0667300400:20"/>ways; ſometimes by coagulating the blood; at others by diſſolving it; and ſometimes by corroding the ſolid parts themſelves: And this may be owing, perhaps, to ſuch natural cauſes as are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of human penetration. Which conſiderations, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deference I pay to <hi>Dr. Boerhaave</hi>'s extraordinary merit and abilities, have induced me to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even, the bare poſſibility of ſuch a diſcovery. But, to go on.</p>
            <p>The Doctor intimates that the bite of the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> which was formerly ſuppoſed to be certain death, is now cured by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the bruiſed <hi>Scorpion,</hi> or the oil of it, and concludes that all poiſons have their <hi>antidotes;</hi> and, therefore, why may not a ſpecific medicine be found out of ſuch a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0667300400:21"/>nature, that, being diffuſed all the body over, after the variolous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is received, may introduce contrary properties, and thereby extinguiſh the diſtemper in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, before thoſe effects are produced which muſt, otherwiſe, neceſſarily follow? For what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, ſays he, in a <hi>Pleuriſy, Quinſy,</hi> &amp;c. would wait for a cure by ſuppuration, when daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence convinces us that theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are regularly cured without it? and why may not the inflammation be carried off, as well, in the firſt ſtage of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> as in other inflammatory diſeaſes, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its coming to ſuppuration at all?</p>
            <p>To this, it may be ſaid, that the general method of cure in <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, Quinſies,</hi> and other inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0667300400:22"/>diſtempers, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contagious, nor of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive kinds, proves inſufficient to prevent the return of them, as often as the ſudden changes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of the weather, different ſeaſons of the year, and many other accidental cauſes may happen to produce them. But, it is not ſo, in regard to the <hi>Small-pox;</hi> a diſeaſe which is propagated by it's own contagion only, without any other antecedent cauſe; and where a determinate length of time brings on every thing according to it's ſtated periods; ſo that nature, in doing her part, is a moſt certain guide to the Phyſician for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his. Beſides it is evident that the venom of this diſtemper can infect us but once; inſomuch that that pabulum in our bodies,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0667300400:23"/>which is productive of this diſeaſe, being totally taken up by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion it hath received, is thereby expunged and eradicated, ſo that there remains nothing, afterwards, on which this morbific matter can have any further effect. And, indeed, in this ſenſe, it may be truly ſaid that the <hi>Small-pox</hi> is it's own <hi>antidote,</hi> by protecting all that undergo it from any future attack.</p>
            <p>It may be granted how extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult it is to clear the maſs of blood of this poiſon; yet it is moſt certainly true that Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, with all her might, at the expulſion of it in the moſt perfect manner; that is, by forcing the morbid matter, as much as poſſible, to the puſtules<note n="*" place="bottom">Mead de variol.</note>: And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0667300400:24"/>any interruption muſt prove of dangerous conſequence, leſt the humours ſhould be impeded in their circulatory motion, and fall into an inteſtine one, and grow putrid; which is frequently the caſe after too large evacuations, or exceſſive heat; where there is ſuch a ſcarcity of ſpirits, that the ſolids do not vibrate ſufficiently to keep the fluids in their due velocity.</p>
            <p>This plainly indicates the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of too great evacuations in the beginning of the <hi>Small-pox;</hi> and ſhews the Phyſician's part to be only to aſſiſt, by following nature; and not going before her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Meaſles</hi> are an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fever of the eruptive kind; whoſe puſtules never arrive to a purulent ſtate like thoſe of the <hi>Small-pox;</hi> and they are cured by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0667300400:25"/>bleeding, and cooling medicines: but, I believe, it was never yet ſeen that theſe remedies could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their eruption, tho' made uſe of ever ſo ſoon after taking in the nfection.</p>
            <p>There have been ſome inſtances in the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> where ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hemorrhages, or other repeated bleedings have ſeemed to alter the nature of the diſtemper in ſome degree, by making that prove kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which would, probably, have fallen out otherwiſe, for want of thoſe evacuations; but, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, there never was any one proof of the contagion being wholly carried off that way, without ſome eruption of the puſtules: ſo that it ſeems evident, even to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that Nature, after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the load that oppreſſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0667300400:26"/>her, muſt be left to do her part in her own way, by cauſing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, in a greater or leſſer degree, as there happens to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it; in order to free the body from the corrupted ſtate of the blood and humours ariſing from the contagious taint of this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is certain that the whole animal body, at all times before it has paſſed through the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> is, in every part alike, liable to receive the morboſe, or infecting taint, and ſo propagate the diſeaſe. We know, alſo, that the leaſt particle of the morbific mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, applied to any part of the body, will cauſe the <hi>Small-pox</hi> to be produced as effectively as a much greater quantity could be capable of doing it. And it is evident, from common experience, that all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0667300400:27"/>mankind, as well thoſe who come of parents that have had the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> as thoſe that have not, are alike liable to it; ſo that we may conclude the pabulum of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper to be a part of the human nature, conceived in the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of generation; and therefore not to be extinguiſhed by any art, or other means, than it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſtroyer, the <hi>Small-pox</hi> itſelf; which only can render the body more perfect, by eradicating this one natural principle of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and thereby giving it a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for ever, againſt any further attack from this great evil.</p>
            <p>The contagion of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> previouſly conſidered in a peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſenſe, the true manner of it's operation on human bodies, as it may be beſt known from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0667300400:28"/>of inoculation, ſeems ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to furniſh more matter for the <hi>Phyſician</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher</hi> than could poſſibly have been advanced without it. Inſomuch that the diſcovery of a ſpecific medicine to prevent the burning of a <hi>Cauſtic,</hi> or even <hi>Fire</hi> itſelf, may as well be expected, as to deſtroy the power of variolous contagion, when taken either in the natural way, or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inoculation. Moſt certain, therefore, it is, that no diſcovery of this kind, ſo ſeemingly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the laws of Nature, can ever be aſcribed to human inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

         <div type="explanation">

            <head>An attempt to explain the manner of the propagation and eruption of the Small-pox, from the practice of inoculation: And why this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, taken by common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in the natural way, proves ſo much more fatal than that which is given by inoculation.</head>
            <p>THE main buſineſs of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, as <hi>Sir Iſaac Newton</hi> obſerves, is to argue from <hi>Phenomena,</hi> without feigning <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes,</hi> and to deduce cauſes from effects till we come to the very firſt cauſe. Therefore it ought to be the ſtudy of Phyſicians to conſider well the various and ſubtile me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which Nature uſeth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing diſeaſes; and this can be known in general only by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0667300400:30"/>ſymptoms that occur to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals in all caſes. For her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is undoubtedly ſlower or faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to the different me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſhe takes in expelling the morbific cauſe, ſo that the morbid particles, being ſeparated by her own action, may be diſcharged in her own way.</p>
            <p>When a body, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes contaminated by a contagious taint, it may be of the greateſt uſe to know by what means it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; as the mode of nature, in her method of extricating the morbific matter, differs, probably, in great meaſure according to the different manner of receiving it: inſomuch that the danger or ſafety of the patient may depend greatly on the primary communication of this matter either to an external or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0667300400:31"/>an internal part. And this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath been confirmed by many obſervations of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by inoculation, where the diſtemper hath been remarkably great from a multitude of the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules, as well as the condition of them; which have gone off, by that preventive means, without any great uneaſineſs; whereas the ſame, in the natural way, are uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a very <hi>high Fever, Delirium,</hi> and other dangerous contingencies, owing probably to imperceptible <hi>effluvia</hi> conveyed, at firſt, to the <hi>Lungs, Heart, Brain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But for a further explanation of this matter, by an enquiry into the different methods that nature pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues in communicating the <hi>Small-pox</hi> both by common infection, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0667300400:32"/>the artificial experiment of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, we ſhall the better form a judgment, agreeable to her own elements and principles, by her own rules and indications. And, in order thereto, it is manifeſtly certain, that, the air being infected with the venom of this diſtemper, the morbific particles, contained therein, are received into the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body by inſpiration; and they act, wherever they happen to fall, by an irreſiſtable power, like fire unextinguiſhable, until they have utterly ſubdued that pabulum in the body which was ſuſceptible of this contaminating taint, and ſo propagated the diſeaſe: for thus it is we are ſecured from having the <hi>Small-pox</hi> a ſecond time. But the cauſes of it's deſtructive malignity may be more than the niceſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0667300400:33"/>can diſcover. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the mode of Nature, from this theory alone, ſeems to be too intricate and perplexing for human underſtanding; inſomuch that the nature of the morbific matter, from whatever different kind of the <hi>Small-pox</hi> it may happen to come, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ſame, and plainly makes no difference in the nature of the diſeaſe. The difference of conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, therefore, it may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be ſuppoſed, is the principal cauſe of the different kinds of the <hi>Small-pox.</hi> And, theſe principles being generally admitted, I think it evident, therefore, as far as it can be demonſtrated from experience, that a different manner in giving the infection (I mean that of ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation) manifeſtly produceth a different effect. And this, I make
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0667300400:34"/>not the leaſt doubt, would unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionably appear upon the trial, if it was poſſible to meet with two perſons of exactly the ſame age and conſtitution, by communicating, to each of them, the ſame conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious taint, by the different ways of infection. But, for want of this, let us examine further, by purſuing the mode of nature, alſo, under the experiment of inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſee what new diſcovery will ariſe to give an additional light to this matter.</p>
            <p>By this method of trial it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the ſmalleſt portion of the variolous pus, applied, by a ſlight inciſion, to any part of the body, acts in the manner of a <hi>cauſtic,</hi> by inflaming and corroding the part; inſomuch that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, after ſome days, is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0667300400:35"/>and an ulceration cauſed from the ſeparation of the <hi>eſchar:</hi> And the taint of this infection, being infuſed into the blood, is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by means of the circulation, throughout the whole animal body; and touching every where on it's proper pabulum, like a ſpark of fire among particles of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> in a certain length of time it doth it's office, by exciting feveriſh ſymptoms, which regularly go off in a <hi>diaphoreſis;</hi> whereby the ſalt ſerum of the blood, ſo impregnated, is driven out by the glands of the ſkin; and then the pores, being properly enlarged, let out the fiery puſtules on the ſurface; which ſeems to be the true manner of the propagation and eruption of the <hi>Small-pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0667300400:36"/>
            <p>From this experiment we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic effluvia of this diſtemper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by inſpiration alſo, produce the ſame kind of <hi>phenomenon</hi> in the natural way; and that theſe veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous particles, happening to fall on the vital parts, by inflaming and corroding the ſame, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are ſo commonly attended with their fatal effects; for inſtance, on the <hi>Lungs, Brain,</hi> &amp;c.; where it is impoſſible for nature to help her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or be furniſhed with any aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to her relief. And this may occaſion, which we daily ſee, <hi>high fevers, delirium, ſhortneſs of breath, the moſt ſurpriſing ſtruggles and conflicts, and ſudden changes in the Small-pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be ſuppoſed, alſo, that an infinite number of the viroſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0667300400:37"/>particles, contained in the infected air, may be drawn in by the breath and noſtrils at the ſame time; and ſo conveyed by the divarication of the <hi>Trachaea</hi> to the <hi>Lungs;</hi> and alſo by the <hi>olfactory nerves,</hi> or their <hi>fibrillae,</hi> to the moſt delicate texture of the brain, whereby a multitude of different parts may receive the contagious effect at the ſame inſtant of time; which, by pervading the innermoſt receſſes of the whole animal <hi>compages,</hi> may ſo break and deſtroy the continuity of parts of moment, as to render a diſſolution of the whole frame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable. And that particular ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> in which the texture of the blood is ſo abſolutely broken, that it diſchargeth itſelf by every outlet of the body; and, ſtagnating in the ſmall cuticular
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0667300400:38"/>veſſels, produceth black, gangren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpots, all the ſurface over, is but too melancholy a proof of the truth of this <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> from the ſudden and untimely deſtruction that it uſually brings upon the patient.</p>
            <p>Inoculation explains alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this opinion: for if the morbific matter be applied to ever ſo many place, it will have the ſame effect in every one; by occaſioning ſo many corroding <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles,</hi> if they may be ſo called; which, the more they are, the more likely they will be to increaſe the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the contagious infection of the blood and ſpirits: and, for this reaſon, I have wholly given up an opinion I had eſpouſed ſome years ago; from a ſuppoſition that diſcharges from more inoculated places than one would be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0667300400:39"/>to the patient, by carrying off a greater quantity of the humours of the body, by means of thoſe drains; and ſo, conſequently, would be likely to prevent ſuch feveriſh diſorders and complaints, as might, otherwiſe, ariſe in the courſe of the <hi>Small-pox.</hi> But experience hath plainly ſhown this kind of doctrine to be erroneous; and convinced me, that the application of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe matter, to one part only, is much ſafeſt and beſt; and, indeed, the corroſion of any one part, cauſed by the application of variolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is a ſufficient proof of its tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect, and doing all that this contagion can do; even tho' there may happen to be ſcarce any febril ſymptoms produced from it, or ſo much as a perfectly diſtinguiſhed puſtule of the <hi>Small-pox:</hi> for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0667300400:40"/>ulcerated part being cicatriſed, will remain, beyond all diſpute, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a mark of ſecurity to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as if the ſkin had received the impreſſions of having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone this diſtemper in ever ſo great a degree. And truly, if it were not ſo, ſeveral perſons, under my own care, who had no puſtulary erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt have taken the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> from thoſe who were their companions and bed-fellows in the diſtemper, by the ordinary way of infection; which the experience of ſuch trials plainly convinced me they could not. From theſe caſes, therefore, it ſeems reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that this kind of artificial car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle, cauſed by the inoculation, was alone capable of extricating from the human nature the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this diſtemper.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0667300400:41"/>
            <p>From what hath been already advanced, it ſeems pretty certain that theſe firſt principles of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> being ſuſceptible of the contagion to the moſt diſtant extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, are diffuſed, in all parts alike, throughout the whole ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal body; the principal caution, therefore, requiſite to be obſerved by Phyſicians, in regard to thoſe in whom this matter is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, is to conſider well their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſtitutions and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they are of themſelves naturally productive of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of the <hi>Small-pox.</hi> For it is, I believe, a generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed opinion that the contagious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of this diſeaſe is in it's own nature the ſame, and differs only according to the different bodies it is infuſed into. In ſome, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0667300400:42"/>we ſee that this poiſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied can produce no more than it's own <hi>variolous carbuncle,</hi> or a very few of the puſtules at moſt, and thoſe of the ſhorteſt duration; whereas, in others, it is manifeſt that the different fluids become more contaminated, and, therefore, conſequently produce other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of the <hi>Small-pox:</hi> and wherever the <hi>lymphatick veſſels</hi> are corroded by the <hi>variolated acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> being more than can be tranſpired by the pores of the ſkin, it occaſions a ſuffuſion of the <hi>lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> itſelf, and ſo conſequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a confluence of the <hi>Small-pox;</hi> and this happening common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a greater degree on the head and face, is undoubtedly owing to the great force of the circulation of the blood, which, carrying
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0667300400:43"/>with it a variolated power, cauſes the effects above mentioned. The ventricles of the brain alſo, from the ſame morboſe cauſe, are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo affected as to occaſion deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, <hi/> in the ſame manner probably, that the effluvia of ſtrong drink and ſpirits affect the brain in drunkenneſs: for thus it is that the blood, having received any morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic taint, purifies itſelf in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, by throwing off it's he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous particles by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon emunctories which nature hath provided, as far as the animal faculties, under a morbid ſtate are capable of accompliſhing it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe principles in our nature, which are ſuſceptible of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> tho' they are not, I believe, as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, liable to undergo a change,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0667300400:44"/>by any power of medicine, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prevent the influence of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolous infection; yet experience convinceth us (if we can be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced) that the manner of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the diſtemper produceth a very different effect: and there can be no occaſion to enforce the truth of this opinion by argument, ſince God's Providence hath appeared, in the ſucceſs of inoculation, ſo much in favour of that practice<note n="*" place="bottom">Since inoculation hath been brought into practice, it is ſaid, by good authority, that there has been an annual decreaſe of a fifth part of the deaths by the <hi>Small-pox</hi> within the bills of mortality.</note>.</p>
