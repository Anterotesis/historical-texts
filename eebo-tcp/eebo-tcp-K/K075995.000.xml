            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Would not thus have addreſs'd your Lordſhip in public, but that in theſe our days the preſs is the only method by which I could gain admiſſion to you, or have the opportunity, to uſe our old College phraſe, of a little CONFAB: Biſhops and Curates are, I believe, at preſent ſeldom ſeen together, except in the prayer for the Clergy. Fortune, my Lord, who brought us ſo cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the Univerſity, where, you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0240600700:5"/>
may remember, we were <hi>Chums,</hi> has at length
<q>Saevo laeta negotio,</q>
as the old bard ſings, in one of her ſtrange freaks, thrown us from the moſt intimate connection into ſtations of life at the utmoſt diſtance from each other, by making your Lordſhip a Biſhop, and me an—Aſſiſtant-Curate. I think, my Lord, I have ſomewhere read, that in the Roman Triumphs a perſon was always appointed to attend the Conqueror, and as he paſſed along to repeat to him—<q rend="inline">"Thou art a man."</q> The following pages may be conſidered as a ſalutary hint of the ſame nature, and were only meant to lay on your Lordſhip's table, and as you ſlip on your lawn, to whiſper to you—<q rend="inline">"Thou art a Clergyman."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0240600700:6"/>
Tho' I do not (to uſe the phraſe of a certain Right Reverend) <hi>baſk in the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of the Goſpel,</hi> you will perceive, nowithſtanding, in the courſe of this Letter, I am not ſo much hurt by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, but that I can laugh at a proper opportunity; at preſent, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am perfectly ſerious, and do from my heart think and declare, that the leaſt grateful acknowledgement which our dignified clergy can make, for the honours and rewards conferred on them, is to aſſiſt their diſtreſſed brethren; to make uſe of their beſt endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the dignity of the miniſterial office: and to gain them ſome deference and reſpect, if they <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> procure them nothing elſe: and yet this, my Lord, I will not ſay wherefore, or by whom, is of late years, moſt ſhamefully neglected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0240600700:7"/>
Your Lordſhip, I am convinc'd by experience, is not without humanity; I have known ſome Biſhops, (formerly I mean) who had not a grain of it in their whole compoſition: but that is not your caſe; I have therefore taken the liberty to appeal to you, in behalf of the inferior clergy of theſe kingdoms, who, I believe, are the moſt diſtreſſed, deſerted, and deſpiſed body of men, at preſent, on the face of the earth: into the cauſes of this, I propoſe cooly and candidly to examine, and to conſult with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip concerning the moſt probable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of removing them.</p>
            <p>I have a thouſand things to ſay to your Lordſhip, on this copious head, which I ſhall reſerve for ſome future occaſion, and for the ſake of method confine myſelf at preſent (tho' I hate confinement of every kind) to a particular branch of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0240600700:8"/>
our ſcanty revenue, commonly known by the name of LECTURESHIPS.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip being much better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with eccleſiaſtical hiſtory than myſelf, could probably acquaint me with the origin and riſe of theſe PAUPERTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIS SUBSIDIA: as I am not, however, very ambitious of tracing the ſource of this muddy ſpring, I ſhall defer the ſearch to another opportunity, and content my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with obſerving (a truth which I am every day more and more convinced of) that the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Lectureſhips</hi> in and about London has been extremely prejudicial to the inferior Clergy of this kingdom, and contributed, in a great meaſure, to bring upon the whole body that poverty and contempt into which they are now fallen; that the methods by which they are obtained are highly unbecoming our character, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0240600700:9"/>
means made uſe of to ſupport them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the duty performed; that they are acquired, in ſhort, with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, loſt with eaſe, and very few of them worth the keeping: which I will endeavour to prove to your Lordſhip in as few words as poſſible.</p>
            <p>It may not, perhaps, be improper, when I talk of SERMONISERS, to follow the uſual SERMON method, and divide my ſubject into three or four general heads; and tho' I would not, as Lord Shaftſbury ſays, <q rend="inline">"bring my two's and three's before a faſhionable congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,"</q> yet, as I am talking only to your Lordſhip, and what paſſes may never go much further than ourſelves, I may as well adopt the TEXTUAL manner; (there, my Lord, is a new word for Johnſon's Dictionary).</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0240600700:10"/>
I ſhall proceed therefore,</p>
            <p>FIRST,</p>
            <p>To conſider how LECTURESHIPS are canvaſſed for.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY,</p>
            <p>What is expected from them. And</p>
            <p>THIRDLY and LASTLY.</p>
            <p>How they are paid, and what emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments uſually ariſe to the poſſeſſors of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, my Lord, with regard to the <hi>canvaſſing</hi> for Lectureſhips, as uſually practiſed amongſt us, I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert, it is an employment ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with the character, and unbecoming the dignity of a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, an office greatly beneath the attention of genius and learning, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0240600700:11"/>
highly unſuitable to all the notions of life imbibed in the courſe of a genteel and liberal education.</p>
            <p>The choice of a LECTURER in this metropolis is generally veſted in the whole body of the pariſh, conſiſting, for the moſt part, of ordinary tradeſmen, ſometimes very low mechanics, perſons not always of the moſt refined manners, or delicate ſenſations. Your Lordſhip, I am ſure, muſt remember, how cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierly, when we were at Cambridge, (for which by the by we deſerved to be horſe-whipped) we uſed to treat the CANAILLE: if an honeſt tradeſman came a dunning to our room of a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Lecture, we tipped the NON DOMI upon him, or if by chance he gained admittance, and grew importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his ſolicitations, without further ceremony ſhewed him the neareſt way
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0240600700:12"/>
down ſtairs. Little did ſome of us think what a different behaviour we ſhould one day be obliged to aſſume towards ſome of their illuſtrious brethren in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.</p>
            <p>The common people, my Lord, in this kingdom of liberty, are of ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible a nature, that the leaſt point of diſpute blows them up into a flame: a conteſt about Church-wardens, the choice of a ſelect veſtry-man, or a paltry Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſhip ſhall ſet as many ſober citizens together by the ears as a County Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To ſay the truth, there is now a days almoſt as much dirty work prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd in the Canvaſſing for one as for the other. The Parſon, as well as the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, muſt play over, if he hopes for Succeſs, all the little low tricks of bribing the indigent, flattering the proud, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joling the rich, abuſing and calumniating
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0240600700:13"/>
his antagoniſt, buying, making, ſplitting, hiding votes; the whole catalogue, in ſhort, of Miniſterial Artifices muſt be practiſed in the veſtry with as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as on the Huſtings; and a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for St. A—'s Church has almoſt as much mire to wade through, as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for St. S—'s Chapel.</p>
            <p>But, as I have heard ſay in Weſtminſter-Hall, there is nothing like a CASE IN POINT; I will therefore treat your Lordſhip with one, to illuſtrate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under conſideration, and that caſe, to prevent any miſtakes, ſhall be—MY OWN.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip I believe may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the time when my poor Uncle died, which obliged me to quit the Univerſity and ſeek my fortune in town, where I had not been above three weeks before
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0240600700:14"/>
I ſtroll'd one Sunday afternoon into a Church in the City, and, after ſervice, heard the Clerk, by order of the Veſtry, declare the Lectureſhip of the pariſh va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and invite the Clergy, however dignify'd or diſtinguiſh'd, to be Candidates for it, and to give in their names by the enſuing Sunday. No ſooner did I hear this CHURCH SERJEANT thus beating up for recruits, than I immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to <hi>enliſt;</hi> and accordingly, the next day, waited on the worſhipful <hi>Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> above-mention'd, who took down my name and place of abode: on my deſiring him at the ſame time to acquaint me with the beſt method of proceeding, which I was an utter ſtranger to, he adviſed me as a friend, to apply as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as poſſible, to Mr. — a Cheeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger in — Lane, who was then firſt Church-warden, a leading man in the Veſtry, and a perſon, he aſſur'd me,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0240600700:15"/>
on whom the Election would in a great meaſure depend. I took honeſt AMEN'S advice, and by nine the next morning, not I muſt own without ſome reluctance, dreſſed myſelf as well as I could, and waited on Mr. Church-warden. As ſoon as he ſaw me enter the Shop in my Canonicals, (for I had hired an excellent new gown and caſſock behind St. Clement's on the occaſion) he made me a very low bow, gave me the title of Doctor, and imagining no doubt that I was come to beſpeak cheeſes for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, begg'd to know my <hi>honour</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; to which I replied in an humble tone, and looking extremely diſconcerted, that I came to wait on him on account of the Lectureſhip of the pariſh, and begg'd the favor of his vote and intereſt, &amp;c. Your Lordſhip I am ſure would have ſmiled to ſee the ſudden alteration of his features and behaviour: he dropp'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0240600700:16"/>
all the tradeſman's obſequiouſneſs, and in a moment aſſumed the magiſterial air and dignity of a Church-warden; turn'd aſide to a woman who was juſt then aſking for a pound of Cheſhire, and without addreſſing himſelf to me, cry'd out, <q rend="inline">"this is the fourth parſon I have had with me to-day on the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand:"</q> then, ſtaring me full in the face; <q rend="inline">"well, young man, ſays he, you intend to be a Candidate for this ſame Lecture: you are all to mount the NOSTRUM, I ſuppoſe, and merit will carry it: for my part, I promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, but remember I tell you before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, I am for <hi>voice</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> ſo mind your hits."</q> When he had ſaid this, he immediately turn'd upon his heel, and went into the Counting-houſe. I took my leave in an awkward manner, as you may ſuppoſe, being not a little chagrin'd at his inſolence; and as I went
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0240600700:17"/>
out of the ſhop, overheard his Lady ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, from behind the counter, that I was a pretty SPRIG of DIVINITY, but look'd a little SHEEPISH, and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to her huſband by MR. SQUINTUM.</p>
            <p>The inſtant I quitted the ſign of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire-Cheeſe, I laid aſide all thoughts of further ſolicitation, and reſolved to return to college, and live on making Fellow-commoner's exerciſes, rather than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject myſelf any more to ſuch mortifying indignities. Good God! thought I to myſelf, is this the fruit of my ſtudies? this the reward of all my toil and labour in the univerſity? to have the important point, whether I ſhall eat or ſtarve, at laſt determin'd by a CHEESEMONGER, who declares for VOICE and ACTION!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0240600700:18"/>
In ſpite, notwithſtanding, of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, (for reſolutions, your Lordſhip knows, are much eaſier made than kept) I was obliged in leſs than ſix months, having during that time taken it into my head to fall in love and marry, to repair once more to the great city, and put into the Eccleſiaſtical lottery; where, by the by, as in moſt other lotteries, you buy ſo dear, meet with ſo few prizes, and run ſo much hazard, that none but deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perado's ought to venture in them: there, my Lord, I renew'd my ſolicitations, and experienced all the miſeries and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, all the inſults and indignities, which the pride and inſolence of the rich, both Laity and Clergy, inflict on their dependent brethren: the difficulties which I met with in ſearch of a <hi>Lecture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> for that was my <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> are inconceivable; and I can aſſure your Lordſhip, that, trifling as the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0240600700:19"/>
are of this preferment, all the perfections of human nature united are ſcarce ſufficient to a man without perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt, to inſure his ſucceſs. The variety of diſtreſſes which I encountered from the different tempers and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> (for ſo I was obliged to call them) who had votes in the pariſh, the mean and abject flattery which I was forc'd to make uſe of, with the many frequent affronts and diſappointments I underwent, would ſwell half a melancholy volume. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enumerating the neceſſary accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments generally expected on theſe occaſions of drinking hard with the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and ſaying ſoft things to their wives; in more pariſhes than one, my Lord, where I have been a Candidate, to ſmoak your half dozen of pipes, and drink two bottles at a ſitting, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more neceſſary perfections than
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0240600700:20"/>
any which you cou'd bring with you from the Univerſity; and it is a maxim with many good citizens, that unleſs you are what they call a d—d honeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, you can never be a good preacher, or an Orthodox Divine; in ſhort, my Lord, and to be ſerious, unleſs a poor Clergyman is every thing that he ought <hi>not</hi> to be, he can never be what is every man's wiſh, independent.</p>
            <p>I muſt not in this place forget to mention one rock which young Divines are perpetually ſplitting on in this voyage, and that is, Party: a Candidate muſt take great care how he repeats his <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Creed;</hi> as, if he declares himſelf on <hi>one</hi> ſide, he will inevitably be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſlander'd and inſulted by the <hi>other;</hi> it behoves him therefore always to join with the ſtrongeſt: but, what is worſt of all, if he is of no ſide, (which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0240600700:21"/>
your Lordſhip well knows is the moſt prudent way,) it is a million to one if he is ſuffered to continue ſo.</p>
            <p>I remember, my Lord, when I ſet up for the Lectureſhip of St. — the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Thermometer of the pariſh was very high; I had at that time, and retain to this moment, the utmoſt contempt for all parties; being ſatisfied, as every man of common underſtanding muſt be, that there is nothing but ſelf-intereſt at the bottom of them: it was very difficult however, I found, to perſuade other men that I was not as fooliſh as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Mr. Alderman Grub, and Mr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Clove, the two leading men in the pariſh, were at that time, or at leaſt profeſſed to be, of oppoſite principles; the Alderman a ſtaunch Whig; the Deputy a reputed Tory; I waited on them both
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0240600700:22"/>
for their votes and intereſt, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which was that I ſucceded with neither, both reproaching me with being of a different way of thinking from themſelves. The Alderman was extremely ſorry he could not ſerve me: he had a regard, he had heard, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, &amp;c. but to be plain with me he was aſſured I had drank tea at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty's: and when I went to the Deputy: for <hi>my</hi> part, (I ſhall never forget it, my Lord, to my dying day) <q rend="inline">"for my part, (ſaid he) I am of no ſide, I deſpiſe all parties whatſomdever, but there are people whom ſome people can't like like other people: in ſhort, I ſhall always be glad to ſee you whilſt you are what you are; but remember, Mr. Parſon, if ever you dine with Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Grub again—you underſtand me—your humble ſervant."</q>

Theſe, my Lord, are but an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the miſeries and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which a poor <hi>Parſon</hi> is ſure to encounter with on this occaſion, but half

                  <l>Which patient merit from th' unworthy takes.</l>
               </q>
For my own part, I cannot but think the very ſingle circumſtance of trapeſing about from door to door in one's <hi>Canonic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> perhaps for a week, is ſufficient to deter any man who has the leaſt regard for cleanlineſs and decorum from can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing for a <hi>City Lectureſhip.</hi> There is not in nature a more ridiculous ſight than a draggletail Divine, holding up his ſpatter'd <hi>Sacerdotals,</hi> and dabbling thro' dirty ſtreets and blind alleys in ſearch of <hi>Civic</hi> preferment.</p>

                        <p>A certain right reverend Prelate, now with God, (that I think, my Lord, is the phraſe when we ſpeak of <hi>departed Epiſcopacy</hi>) had, amongſt other reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchemes, entertain'd a deſign of oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Clergy, and eſpecially thoſe of the Metropolis, to appear conſtantly in their proper <hi>Uniform,</hi> and on no account permitting them to be ſeen in public without a <hi>gown</hi> and <hi>caſſock:</hi> of what ſervice this reformation cou'd poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be to religion and virtue I muſt own I could never diſcover, whilſt the inconveniences attending it to the poor Clergy are ſufficiently obvious. It has been ſaid, I know, by the advocates for this plan, that whenever a <hi>Clergyman</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>as ſuch</hi> he will always meet with the reſpect due to his function, and that

                        <p>You, my Lord, I make no doubt meet with all the deference and reſpect which are due to your exalted ſtation and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: but I muſt beg your Lordſhip not to attribute it to wrong motives, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the bows made to you in the ſtreet are a tribute to your <hi>roſe</hi> and <hi>bever:</hi> the incenſe I aſſure your Lordſhip is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the <hi>mitre</hi> only. The reverence is not paid to you as a paſtor of the flock of Chriſt; it is your <hi>temporal</hi> and not your <hi>ſpiritual</hi> dignity that attracts the attention, and commands the homage of the multitude: it is not becauſe you have three thouſand ſouls under your care, but that you have three thouſand pounds per Annum. I have read, my Lord, and do verily believe, that there

was a time, tho' not within our memory, when the <hi>Clergy</hi> of all ranks, dignify'd or undignify'd, met with ſome degree of reſpect, as ſuch, even in this kingdom, but thoſe days are gone and paſt, and ſo very different are the manners of this age, that I would venture one of my beſt ſermons againſt your Lordſhip's laſt new gown and caſſock (we philoſophers, my Lord, conſider one another's wants) that if your Lordſhip, when you go next to the Houſe of Peers, will ſtep out of your chariot at Charing-croſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your purple-fring'd gloves, your footman behind, or any other external mark that might betray your quality, you ſhall walk from thence to Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard without being once oblig'd to pull off your hat in return for any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paid to your <hi>cloth.</hi> Nobody, my Lord, in theſe our days, takes any notice of a <hi>gown</hi> and <hi>caſſock;</hi> except perhaps

            <p>What is expected from <hi>Lecturers,</hi> and how they are generally treated when they become ſo. Let us now then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the poor Candidate, after going through all theſe fiery trials, ſhould at length be ſo fortunate as to make his calling and election ſure: behold him choſen, licenſed, and <hi>In-pulpited</hi> (there, my Lord, is another new word for you, and I ſee no reaſon why it is not as good as <hi>Inſtall'd</hi>) he will find that <hi>ſeat,</hi> or rather <hi>ſtanding</hi> of honor a <q rend="inline">"painful pre-eminence;"</q> for, as high as he may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0240600700:30"/>
there imagine himſelf, not a creature who ſits <hi>below</hi> but thinks himſelf far <hi>above</hi> him. Every man that gave you his vote will conſider you from that day forth, and as long as you continue in that ſituation, as his inferior: he looks upon himſelf as one of your <hi>feeders,</hi> to whom you are indebted for your <hi>daily bread,</hi> and therefore expects you will honor him accordingly, and for this ſpecial reaſon, becauſe if <hi>you</hi> withdraw your <hi>complaiſance, he</hi> may withdraw his—<hi>Subſcription.</hi> But let us attend a little to the precarious tenure on which he holds his new preferment. When a man is in peaceable poſſeſſion of a good living, ſcarce any body takes notice of his preaching. It matters very little whether he is as elegant as <note n="*" place="bottom">The reader is deſired to fill up theſe blank ſpaces with the names of the beſt and worſt Preacher he is acquainted with.</note> — or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0240600700:31"/>
as contemptible as Dr. —. But with a <hi>Lecturer</hi> the caſe is extremely different; he is conſidered by his hearers as a kind of Divinity-cook, and is expected, like other cooks, to adapt every thing to every body's palate; and let him have ever ſo much merit, 'tis a hundred to one he does not pleaſe one in a hundred, for it is all whim and caprice. If he has a loud voice, perhaps he may be called a Brawler, he takes too much pains, labours, and ſo forth; if he is weak and low, he is cenſur'd as ſpiritleſs and inanimate; if his action is ſlow and ſolemn, he ſhall be termed liſtleſs and indolent; if it be ſtrong, and vary'd, it ſhall be called vehement and theatrical: for the poor judges he is talking to never conſider the different ſubjects to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that one may require ſober and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed behaviour in the utterance, another lively, ſpirited, and diffuſed geſture.</p>

In moſt other profeſſions, thoſe who apply for your aid and inſtruction will at leaſt allow you ſome knowledge in your <hi>own</hi> buſineſs, and have complaiſance enough to ſuppoſe you have a tolerable idea of and acquaintance with the matter of it; but in <hi>Divinity</hi> it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: every Auditor in a church is as good a judge (or at leaſt thinks himſelf ſo) both of the ſubject, and the manner of treating it, as yourſelf, and will not fail to ſhew his judgment with regard to ſtile, ſentiment, and delivery, though he knows no more of either than the deſk you write upon.</p>

The following, my Lord, is a fact which happened to myſelf.</p>
            <p>Being engaged one whole week in writing an anſwer to a political Pamphlet againſt the D— of N— for which I had twenty pieces (more, by the by, than I got by preaching in a twelve-month) I ventured on the Saturday night to tranſcribe a diſcourſe of Tillotſon's, and preached it on the Sunday morning to a very polite audience: on my coming out of church, I was ſaluted by one of the Overſeers with—<q rend="inline">"thank you, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for your excellent Sermon; but let me tell you 'twas a dangerous topic for a young man; to be ſure you might have treated it a little more fully <hi>(obſerve his complaiſance)</hi> but upon the whole it was really a good diſcourſe, and I am ſure all your own; but I remember a glorious one of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0240600700:34"/>
Tillotſon's on that very ſubject. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member—that you do not indeed, my friend, replied I, (I could not help it, my Lord, for the life of me) for the ſermon you juſt now heard is the very ſame, word for word, I aſſure you, and you will find it when you go home, Vol. and page—ſo and ſo."</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let a man preach his <hi>own</hi> ſermons, or any body's elſe, he can never expect to pleaſe for any length of time; I have ſcarce ever known a Lecturer continue a favourite above two or three years: if he always preaches himſelf he grows tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and if he puts in another he is cenſured as idle and negligent: if his Deputy preaches better, or which is the ſame thing, <hi>appears</hi> to preach better than himſelf, it ſinks the principal into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and if the Deputy does not preach ſo well, hints are given him that it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0240600700:35"/>
would be better if ſome folks would do their own duty; add to this that, your conſtant Church-trotters and Text<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markers, who take down the heads in their pocket-books, are always ſmoaking your ſtale divinity, and expect a new diſcourſe to tickle their ears every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. We can ſee the ſame play at the theatre, hear the ſame ſtory abroad, or read the ſame book at home, perhaps once in a month at leaſt, with pleaſure; but to liſten to the ſame diſcourſe from a pulpit once in three years, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we do not actually remember a line more than the text, is, for what reaſon I know not, moſt intolerable.</p>
            <p>I am as throughly convinced as I am of my own Exiſtence that <hi>Lectureſhips</hi> greatly promote and increaſe <hi>Methodiſm.</hi> A deſire of ſtriking out ſomething new and uncommon <hi>to tickle the ears of</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0240600700:36"/>
               <hi>the Groundlings</hi> has led many a plain well-meaning preacher into romantic ſallies, and theatrical geſtures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly drawn them into methodiſtical rant and enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>There never was a duller hound than that <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Servitors</hi> as they are termed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or what we call in Cambridge <hi>Sizers,</hi> go, at <hi>King's College,</hi> and there only, by the name of <hi>Hounds.</hi> Mr. Jones was a <hi>hound of King's.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>hound</hi> of King's, whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt remember as well as myſelf, the famous <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> of St. Saviour's: he had preached for ſome time in the old Dog-trot ſtile of Firſt to the Firſt, Secondly to the Second, and adminſter'd his gentle ſoporifics to no purpoſe for a year or two, when, finding it would not do, all on a ſudden he ſhook his ears, ſet up a loud bark, and by mere dint of noiſe, vociferation, and grimace, mouth'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0240600700:37"/>
and bellow'd himſelf into reputation amongſt the gentlemen of the <hi>Clink,</hi> out-heroded Herod, and almoſt eclips'd the fame of Weſley, Whitfield, and Madan.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed, my Lord, (to ſpeak in the <hi>Parſonic</hi> ſtile) to my <hi>third general head,</hi> viz. the manner in which Lectureſhips are uſually paid, which is equally injurious to our character and function.</p>
            <p>I know a little too much of the world, my Lord, to expect that a Parſon ſhould be paid like a Firſt-rate Player, a Pimp, or a Lord of the Treaſury, whoſe incomes I believe are pretty near equal; but at the ſame time cannot help thinking, that a labourer in the Vineyard is as well worthy of his hire, as a Journeyman Carpenter, Maſon, &amp;c. and has as good
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0240600700:38"/>
a right to two pound two on a Sunday as he has on a Saturday night; and yet not one in a hundred of us is paid in that proportion.</p>
            <p>The Lecturer's box generally goes about with the reſt of the pariſh Beggars a little after Chriſtmas; and every body throws in their charity, (for it is always conſidered in that light) as they think proper. Were I to tell your Lordſhip how many paltry excuſes are made to evade this little annual tribute by the mean and ſordid, how very little is given even by the moſt generous, and what an inconſiderable ſum the whole generally amounts to, the recital would not afford you much entertainment, and, for aught I know might even give you ſome ſmall concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0240600700:39"/>
You cannot imagine, my Lord, with what an envious eye we poor Lecturers have often looked over a Waiter's book at a Coffee-houſe, where I have ſeen ſuch a collection of guineas and half guineas as made my mouth water: to give leſs than a crown at leaſt, would be to the laſt degree ungenteel, for the immenſe trouble of handing a diſh of coffee, or a news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper; whilſt the poor Divine, who has toil'd in the Miniſtry for a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, and half worn out a pair of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent lungs in the unprofitable ſervice, ſhall think himſelf well rewarded with the noble donation of <hi>half a crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to illuſtrate my ſubject, I will give your Lordſhip another ſtory: there is nothing like a little painting from the life on theſe occaſions: ſuppoſe yourſelf then, my Lord, an eye-witneſs of the

            <p>Theſe, my Lord, are melancholy truths, and, though you and I who are philoſophers may laugh at them, have made many an honeſt man's heart ake.</p>
