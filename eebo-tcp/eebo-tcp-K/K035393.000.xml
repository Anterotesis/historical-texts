            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE formality with which this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle performance is divided into ſections, and illuſtrated with notes, may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly give umbrage to the more ſprightly and volatile criticks of the preſent times. This method, however, was choſen, leſt any confuſion ſhould ariſe in the minds of readers of little attention and ſhort memories, from the writer's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed tranſition from one thing to another, in treating of thoſe various ſubjects, high and low, ſerious and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick, general and perſonal, which are contained in the following ſheets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0047702300:3"/>By this method, alſo, the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of thoſe perſons is ſuited, whoſe time may poſſibly be too precious to admit of their peruſing the whole, and yet may have an itching curioſity to look at ſome particular part.</p>

               <head>SECTION I. INTRODUCTORY.</head>
               <p>WHAT a well-bred age do we live in? Time was, when writers might boldly call in queſtion the abilities of each other, without incurring the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>malignity,</hi> or even ſometimes forfeiting their title to diſtinguiſhed urbanity; when the meaneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual in the Republick of Letters had a right to bring the charge of <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>inattention</hi> againſt the proudeſt champion that ever brandiſhed gooſe-quill; when he might cite the accuſed to appear at the bar of the publick, and give teſtimony in plain terms againſt him without ceremony or equivocation. Time was, I ſay, when this impartial tribunal alſo, attentive only to the matter of fact and the evidence laid before it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0047702300:7"/>
paſſed ſentence on the <hi>convicted</hi> without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, honouring the proſecutor with its thanks and protection, as a friend to juſtice and the intereſts of literature.</p>
               <p>How different is the caſe at preſent! when the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a literary reputation, however obtained, is ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a certain political privilege, however acquired; though it be notorious that ignorance and partiality operate as powerfully in the one caſe, as bribery and corruption are ſometimes ſuppoſed to do in the other. But when the candidates are once chaired, and their opponents have not influence enough to get them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, it is theirs to ſit in judgment on their fellow ſubjects, and give laws to the world of letters.</p>
               <p>It is well, however, for the progreſs of <hi>Science,</hi> and the independency of <hi>Wit,</hi> that the Seſſion of the Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Junto is not ſo firmly eſtabliſhed as that of the political. They are both provided, indeed, with their uſhers and ſerjeants reſpectively; but, however tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous may be the magiſterial authority of the one, nothing can be more ridiculous than the critical mock-majeſty of the other.</p>
               <p>The author of the Review of Dr. Johnſon's Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare hath, it ſeems, been committed to the cuſtody of theſe literary mirmidons, and formally proceeded againſt for a breach of privilege. The Doctor, we are told, was above being called to account by any private individual whatever; it being the higheſt indignity to the <hi>majority</hi> even to ſuſpect the inability of a writer, whom they had been pleaſed to vote <hi>infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0047702300:8"/>As a friend to the <hi>Reviewer,</hi> therefore, I take up the pen to defend his cauſe, and aſſert the right of every citizen in the Republick of Letters, to think and write freely. To this I am particularly incited alſo, from a due ſenſe that ſuch freedom is become abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſupport the preſent intereſts of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature; which are daily drooping under the dead weights of indolence, partiality, and prepoſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible that theſe obſtacles to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ſcience, and the advancement of letters, are commonly called by other names. I well know that, in this age of civility and falſe refinement, mere COURTESY is termed <hi>candour,</hi> CEREMONY is called <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs,</hi> QUAINTNESS <hi>elegance,</hi> PEDANTRY <hi>erudition,</hi> and DULLNESS <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>decorum.</hi> On the other hand, SINCERITY is termed <hi>inſult,</hi> CENSURE is called <hi>cruelty,</hi> and WIT and HUMOUR <hi>petulance</hi> and <hi>ill-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> In the mean time a zeal for <hi>truth</hi> is looked upon as a kind of canine madneſs; and a heart-felt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for true genius and learning is deſpiſed as a literary phrenzy. Thus are we degenerated from our forefathers; from the wits and philoſophers of thoſe ages which produced a Shakeſpeare, a Bacon, a Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and a Milton; whom inſtead of imitating, we exert all our little abilities to depreciate, and level with the diminutive ſtandard of the preſent times. A late noble writer obſerves, reſpecting our moral and political character, that we are now-a-days ſo far from having the <hi>virtues</hi> of great men, that we have not even their <hi>vices</hi>; every thing, ſays he, is little, mean, and pitiful among us. This might with greater juſtice be ſaid of our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0047702300:9"/>
                  <hi>literary</hi> character; our taſte for works of real genius, true ſcience, and ſolid erudition, being almoſt dwindled into nothing. In the mean time we ſee the petty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to wit and learning induſtriouſly forming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into parties for the ſupport of each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they find themſelves unable to ſtand alone. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity naturally tends to render people complacent and civil; while the cunning, uſually attendant on ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, artfully teaches them to make a merit of their weakneſs, and to impute even their puſillanimity to candour and benevolence.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that a writer, who hath the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude alone to attack one of the greateſt of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and illiberal combinations, ſhould create himſelf a number of enemies; nor is it indeed a wonder that the impartial publick ſhould, for a while, be miſled by the ſelf intereſted clamours, which ſo numerous a body of partiſans may raiſe againſt him. It is boldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, however, that if the publick ſhould fully and coolly enquire into the real ſtate of the caſe, the motives for ſuch attack, and the merits and demerits of the parties aſſailed and defended, they will not only acquit the Reviewer of the falſe charges of illiberality and malignity brought againſt him; but will be ready to acknowledge that the chaſtiſement Dr. Johnſon hath received at his hands, is no leſs defenſible with regard to its ſeverity, than it is juſtifiable in reſpect to its cauſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Reaſons for the Reviewer's having a leſs exalted opinion of Dr. J's abilities than has been entertained by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in general.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THERE is nothing which, at firſt ſight, gives us greater offence or diſguſt, than to ſee thoſe perſons or characters, for whom we have been uſed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a certain degree of reſpect, treated with familiarity or contempt. Nor is it at all neceſſary to this end, that ſuch treatment ſhould on their part be merited. It is enough that we are ignorant of their demerits; of which it is afterwards very difficult to convince us, even by the ſtrongeſt teſtimony. We are by no means eaſily reconciled to ſuch an inſtance of our want of ſagacity, as that of having long entertained a favourable opinion, much leſs a kind of reverence, for an object unworthy of it. We are apt to heſitate, therefore, at the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant proofs of our miſtake, and even to take offence at any ſuppoſed indignity offered to ſuch characters, as if it in ſome meaſure affected ourſelves.</p>
               <p>This hath been remarkably the caſe in the preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of Mr. K's Review of Dr. Johnſon's Shakeſpeare; even thoſe, who could not fail of being convinced of the juſtice of the Reviewer's remarks, finding in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſomething repugnant to the ludicrous and ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtical manner in which Mr. K. had thought proper to reprehend this editor. Admitting for the preſent, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the cauſe of ſuch reprehenſion was juſt, they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0047702300:11"/>
cannot fail, on reflection, to impute that repugnance to their prepoſſeſſion in favour of Dr. J. and their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Reviewer's having ſtill farther motives for his ſeverity, than appeared on the face of his pamphlet.</p>
               <p>That none of theſe motives were perſonal, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer hath repeatedly and publickly declared. What they were, may be gathered from this and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſections.</p>
               <p>The Reviewer, it ſeems, had been ſome years abroad, when he firſt heard of the publication of Dr. Johnſon's Dictionary; a work of which he had formed the higheſt expectations from the ſuppoſed abilities and great reputation of its author. At the ſame time, being apprehenſive that his own application to the uſe of foreign languages might, in ſome meaſure, corrupt that of his native tongue, he procured Dr. J's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently elaborate performance, in order to correct both his memory and judgment, as either might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally fail him. Having thus, during an interval of ſeveral years, had more frequent occaſions to conſult an Engliſh dictionary, than poſſibly would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him in any other ſituation, he could not fail of being greatly ſurprized and diſappointed at the many palpable and groſs miſtakes which had eſcaped this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated lexicographer. He was not ſo unreaſonable to expect, indeed, that, in a work of ſuch extent, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of trivial, and perhaps ſome important errors, ſhould not eſcape the moſt attentive and induſtrious compiler. He could neither expect, however, nor overlook ſuch an amazing number of blunders and inconſiſtencies in etymology, orthoepy, idiom and grammatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0047702300:12"/>
as were to be found in a work, which was boaſted of as a capital undertaking, and recommended to foreigners as a ſtandard of the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>He would have been careleſs of the honour, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the literature of his country <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſpecially as he obſerved that ſucceeding dictionary-writers, both abroad and at home, implicitly adopted the moſt egregious errors on the authority of Johnſon. Sufficient proof of this may be had by an examination of Bailey's Dictionary, improved by Scott; Baretti's Italian and Engliſh Dictionary, and others.</note>, had he not every where taken a proper occaſion, therefore, to ſpeak of the defects and imperfections of Dr. Johnſon's Dictionary. At the ſame time, that he might not be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the labours of another, without ſufficient cauſe, he amuſed himſelf occaſionally with forming a table of <hi>errata</hi> to that performance, intending ſome time or other to offer it to the proprietors; and, in caſe of their refuſal to accept it, to lay it before the publick.</p>
               <p>The Reviewer's liſt of errors was pretty copious when he returned to England; ſince when, having applied more cloſely to literary matters, he hath increaſed it almoſt tenfold, and that by no means to the honour of Dr. Johnſon's boaſted erudition and profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Engliſh tongue.</p>
               <p>This detection of the <hi>Lexicographer</hi> induced the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer to make a cloſer examination, than he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done, into the compoſitions of the <hi>writer</hi>; in which were found the ſame traces of <hi>inattention</hi> to the idiom of our tongue, and of his imperfect acquaintance with other modern languages. In the mean time, he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0047702300:13"/>
was found to be eternally aiming at the introduction of Latiniſms, and other vicious modes of expreſſion, by way of <hi>enriching</hi> our tongue; but thereby corrupting it, as he himſelf ſays of Shakeſpeare, <q>by almoſt every mode of depravation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In his productions of imagination, his invention ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared weak and languid. It exerted itſelf, indeed, now and then with tolerable ſucceſs in a <hi>dream</hi> or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but it was hardly ever wide awake, without ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fatigued with its efforts toward vigility, and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily dropping into a doze again. As to his works of knowledge and judgment, there appeared hardly any trace of the author's acquaintance with the ſciences in any of his writings; nay, even his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended profundity in morals, and the knowledge of mankind, ſeemed to the Reviewer nothing more than a quaint and affected exhibition of the trite obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and hackney'd reflections of others.</p>
               <p>His greateſt merit appeared to conſiſt in the labour thrown away on the tawdry glare of deſcription, and the gloſſy, but fading, poliſh of ſtile. Inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing great and noble images, he ſeldom reached far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than high-ſounding words. Inſtead of new and really elegant turns of thought, his novelty and refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment generally ended in ſome florid alluſion, quaint antitheſis, or fantaſtical preciſeneſs of expreſſion. His verſe ſeemed heavy, cold and ſpiritleſs; and his proſe alternately pompous and puerile.</p>
               <p>A farther acquaintance with Dr. Johnſon's literary character, acquired even among and from his own
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0047702300:14"/>
friends, had by no means contributed to remove Mr. K's unfavourable opinion of this writer, when his long-expected edition of Shakeſpeare made its appearance.</p>
               <p>Having been already ſo egregiouſly diſappointed as to the philological abilities of Dr. J. the Reviewer's expectations were by no means ſo ſanguine as before. His enthuſiaſtic veneration for Shakeſpeare, however, could not be reſtrained within the bounds of ſilence, on finding this editor had taken every opportunity to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the merit of that incomparable bard; on whom Dr. J. hath, in repeated inſtances, (as is ſhewn in Mr. K's Review) endeavoured to fix the charge of <hi>incapacity, folly, vulgarity, immorality</hi> and <hi>impiety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To aggravate all this, Dr. J. falls with equal vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the only commentator on Shakeſpeare, that, by his own confeſſion, hath acquitted himſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; charging him with <hi>weakneſs, ignorance, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faithleſſneſs, petulance</hi> and <hi>oſtentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who complain of Mr. K's ſeverity, and charge him with ſcurrility, ill-manners and abuſe, would do well to look through his work, and ſee if they can find any paſſage wherein he hath called Dr. J. <hi>mean, faithleſs, immoral</hi> or <hi>impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But Shakeſpeare and Theobald are <hi>dead,</hi> and Dr. Johnſon is <hi>alive</hi>; the former cannot ſuffer by any thing that is ſaid of them, whereas the latter may be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially hurt by an attack on his reputation.</q>
This may be urged, indeed, by thoſe who conceive Mr. K's exceſſive zeal for the honour of the dead is leſs excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable than Dr. J's exceſs of tenderneſs for the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the living. It is very certain that, as they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0047702300:15"/>
ariſe from different motives, they muſt neceſſarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with, or counteract each other. It is difficult, indeed, to ſay which ſavours moſt of envy and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note n="*" place="bottom">It is very juſlty obſerved, however, by a late ingenious French writer; S'il eſt horrible d'inſulter aux vivans combien plus odieux eſt il de fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rir la reputation des morts!</note>. We may envy the reputation both of the living and the dead; but can hate only the living. Even hate, however, may ariſe from laudable principles, as honeſt men deteſt knaves, and lovers of truth abhor falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: but envy, whether directed to the living or dead, is a mean and odious paſſion. At the ſame time, it muſt be univerſally allowed more brave and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though it may be leſs prudential, to attack the reputation of the living than the dead. Now fortitude hath ever been eſteemed the general concomitant of ingenuouſneſs and candour, which never harbour in envious minds.</p>
               <p>So far Mr. K. hath evidently the advantage over Dr. J. Beſides, the friends of the latter, while they charge the former with envy at Dr. J's abilities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, accuſe him at the ſame time with inſufferable ſelf-ſufficiency and vanity. But if the contempt with which he hath treated Dr. J. proceed really from his vanity and ſelf-ſufficiency, there is the leſs room to think him ſubject to the motives of envy; for we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can envy thoſe we truly deſpiſe. The truth, I imagine, is, that Mr. K. neither does the one nor the other by Dr. J. notwithſtanding he hath ſufficiently ſhewn a fixed deteſtation of that editor's literary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct. This deteſtation, as I obſerved before, may nevertheleſs be very juſt and laudable; in which caſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0047702300:16"/>
its effects cannot, with any propriety, be imputed to malignity.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now proceed to enquire how far Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be defended from the ſuſpicion of envy, as the motive for his abuſe of Theobald and Shakeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>As it behoves others, however, to exculpate the Doctor, I ſhall only propoſe a few queſtions to thoſe of his friends, who may chuſe to anſwer them; ſuch anſwers, in my opinion, tending effectually either to clear or convict him of acting from invidious motives.</p>

               <p>IT hath been ſaid, with regard to Dr. W-rb-r-t-n, that he abundantly deſerved the ſcurrility and abuſe, which it is pretended Mr. K. hath thrown upon him;
<q>becauſe he was the firſt author who introduced ſuch ſoul language into controverſy, which he never failed to beſtow on all his opponents when he dared. But with Dr. Johnſon the caſe is otherwiſe; he never gave any public offence, nor even engaged in any controverſy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who affirm all this, appear to know but very little of Dr. Johnſon; nay, even to forget the fact for which he is arraigned. Did he give no public offence in the circumſtances attending his edition of Shakeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare?

               <p>The following queries, however, take in a farther retroſpect of Dr. J's literary conduct; the general te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of which will be found to be tinctured with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious diſpoſition, that he was fond of indulging in actions, which his timidity was too great to permit him openly to avow.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether Dr. J. deſerves better treatment than he has received; and how far Mr. K. is excuſable in having ſo treated him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>DR. Johnſon's friends will doubtleſs object, that it is much eaſier to aſk queſtions than to anſwer them, and that injurious inuendoes may be ſafely conveyed in the way of query, even though they ſhould be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not have preſumed to aſk thoſe queſtions, however, had not Mr. K. furniſhed me with authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated materials for making a ſatisfactory reply to every ſingle article, if the Doctor, or his friends, ſhould at any time require it. It was thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in the mean time, to ſtate the merits of Dr. J's literary character rather in a problematical than a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0047702300:22"/>
peremptory manner, that his partizans might ſolve any difficulties that might ariſe, in the beſt manner they are able. But if they cannot obviate ſuch difficulties, and that very ſoon, it is not to be doubted that the good ſenſe ahd impartiality of the publick will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over its former prepoſſeſſions, and determine for me that Dr. J. hath met with no worſe treatment than he deſerves.</p>
               <p>How far Mr. K. is defenſible in having inflicted it, is another matter of conſideratioh. If the Reviewer, in the height of his zeal for the honour of Shakeſpeare, hath given too great a looſe to his paſſions, and hath expreſſed himſelf unbecoming a ſcholar and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he hath in ſo doing injured his own reputation more than he hath done that of Dr. Johnſon. Nor is it any juſtification of Mr. K's ſcurrility to ſay it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree leſs ſcurrilous than that of the Doctors J—n or W—n.</p>
               <p>If their fault, however, be no juſtification of his, it is ſome excuſe for the latter that it appears to be the natural effect of a reſentment excited by nobler and leſs intereſted motives.</p>
               <p>To attack a man, in the warmth of reſentment, however rudely, who is alive and able to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is certainly leſs exceptionable, in point of honour and ſpirit at leaſt, than a premeditated deſign, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and executed in cold blood, to ſtrip the dead of thoſe honours which ſucceſſive ages had beſtowed on their memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0047702300:23"/>It is to be obſerved alſo, that it is not very eaſy for men of warm paſſions, when affected with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to expreſs their reſentment in terms always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the common forms of politeneſs. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſufficiently evinces this, as we may be convinced by turning to almoſt any polemic writings, even on thoſe ſubjects which in a peculiar manner require the appearance at leaſt of the higheſt degree of temper and benevolence.</p>
               <p>There is one cireumſtance, indeed, in which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer ſeems juſtly to have incurred the cenſure of impoliteneſs and want of urbanity. This is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection he hath made on a certain <hi>natural</hi> infirmity of Dr. J. In anſwer to this charge, however, it is to be obſerved, that Mr. K. being perſonally a ſtranger to the Doctor, and having formed the ideas of his character purely on the repreſentations of the Doctor's friends, he really miſtook that infirmity for an affected habit; as thoſe very friends, in repeating Dr. J's bons mots, conſtantly made uſe of the ſame habit or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to heighten the joke; and therefore may be as juſtly ſaid to have ridiculed it themſelves, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Mr. K. has done.

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0047702300:25"/>When an imperfect edition of <hi>Epiſtles to Lorenzo</hi> firſt made its appearance in England, theſe criticks, who had not long before entered on their judicial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, approved of them as ſpirited, juſt, poetical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive, ſenſible and true <note n="*" place="bottom">CRITICAL REVIEW, vol. iii. page 164.</note>.</p>
               <p>In their Review of the ſecond edition, they again confeſſed
<q>they could not help admiring the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, the ſpirit, the variety of the author's expreſſion and imagery <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid, vol. vi. page 444.</note>;</q>

               </p>
               <p>In ſpeaking of the ſame writer's tranſlations, they expreſs themſelves with equal warmth of approbation. —Of that of <hi>Rouſſeau</hi>'s <hi>Eloiſa,</hi> they ſay,
<q>It is but, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to add, that we never peruſed a more ſpirited, juſt and elegant tranſlation than that of Eloiſa, though one of the moſt difficult performances in the French language, as it abounds with turns, ſentiments and idiomatical expreſſions, which will hardly bear being tranſlated into a foreign tongue <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid, vol. xii. page 211.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of <hi>Geſner's Rural Poems,</hi> they affirm,
<q>that in the harmony of the periods, the conciſeneſs, the elegance and ſimplicity of ſtile, the original German is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily imitated by the Engliſh verſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Will it be believed, when I affirm it, that theſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious criticks have, at other times, compared this

                  <hi>their admirable</hi> genius to Sternhold and Hopkins? or that, in their preſent ſtrictures, they have charged ſo ſenſible, ſo poetical, ſo metaphyſical a writer, with having publiſhed paultry obſervations, and ridiculous abſurdities, in his Review of Dr. Johnſon's Shakeſpeare? Nay, ſo treacherouſly has their ſpleen dealt with their memory, that they have even ventured to pronounce that
<q>the Trevoux Dictionary appears to be the ne plus ultra of the French learning</q>
of the author of the <hi>ſpirited, juſt</hi> and <hi>elegant</hi> tranſlation of Eloiſa!</p>
               <p>The reader will very naturally aſk, what can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the meaning of ſuch ſtrange inconſiſtency?— I will endeavour to inform him. When the Critical Reviewers were ſo laviſh of their encomiums on Mr. K's writings, they were either ignorant of his private connections, or that he was the author of ſuch writings; and thus may be ſuppoſed to have ſpoken of them to the beſt of their judgment, without partiality or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; Mr. K. however, had no ſooner ſhewn himſelf above being elated with the applauſe of ignorance, and had corrected them for the fallacy of their hypercriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms <note n="*" place="bottom">In the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> or the <hi>Critics Criticiſed</hi>; for an account of which, ſee the Critical and Monthly Reviews for the year 1759.</note>, than they became immediately his enemies; and that in a more virulent manner, when he was known to give the preference to a rival Review. Such, it is preſumed, are the ſecret ſprings by which theſe tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous judges of literary merit muſt, in this caſe, appear to be actuated.</p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Critical Reviewer's ipſe dixit gives the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Dr. Johnſon's reading; but the misfortune is, that what theſe Criticks impute to Mr. K. is the reading of all the modern editions, and not Mr. Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick's <note n="*" place="bottom">The editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, quoting this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from Mr. K's Review, ſays, he would have it to be "<hi>The</hi> fever of the mad." An egregious proof this of the attention and capacity of theſe writers to correct Mr. K. who in fact only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Dr. Johnſon's reading in this paſſage; advancing nothing of his own, except by way of mere hypotheſis.</note>; ſo that the reader hath here a moſt notable inſtance of their judgment and impartiality in exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the above two criticiſms as juſt ſpecimens of Mr. K's Review.</p>
               <p>They proceed, nevertheleſs, in the ſame magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and dogmatical ſtile to expoſe their own ignorance ſtill farther in the following paſſages. His, ſay they, that is, Mr. K's, "deriving the word <hi>feodary</hi> from the word <hi>foedus,</hi> a covenant, is an inſtance of ignorance hardly to be paralleled. The beſt Engliſh writers ſay <hi>feodum,</hi> inſtead of <hi>feudum.</hi> A feodary therefore is one who <hi>owes</hi> ſuit and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0047702300:29"/>
to his ſuperior. Warburton's inaccuracy in ſpell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word <hi>feuda,</hi> which is the Scottiſh term, inſtead of <hi>feoda,</hi> has brought our Critick into a blunder. A feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary is no other than a <hi>ſervant,</hi> an <hi>agent</hi>; and the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance brought by this Reviewer from Cymbeline confirms it."</p>
               <p>The word, whoſe derivation is here diſputed, is, in ſome editions of Shakeſpeare, ſpelt <hi>fedary,</hi> without the dipthong. Suppoſing Mr. K. to be miſtaken, however, which I do not believe to be the caſe, this inſtance of ignorance, as the critic calls it, is yet to be parallel'd, as he may ſee, by turning to Bailey's Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, corrected and enlarged by Scot; where he will find the ſenſe of the word, and even of the paſſage quoted from Cymbeline, laid down in the ſame manner. <hi>Feuda</hi> may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ought I know, be a Scottiſh term, and it may in Scotland mean a ſlave or ſervant; but neither Shakeſpeare nor Mr. K. wrote Scotch, but Engliſh; of which it is hardly poſſible for a Scotchman ever to be a <hi>compleat</hi> maſter.</p>
               <p>The next offence theſe criticks take at Mr. K's il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration is his philoſophical explanation of the word <hi>warps</hi> in the famous ſong of <hi>Blow thou winter's wind.</hi> On which occaſion they expreſs themſelves as follows:</p>
               <p>"What a pity it is that this writer's whole diſplay of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and natural knowledge ſhould be entirely thrown away; ſince nothing is more certain, than that Shakeſpeare meant no more by <hi>warping,</hi> but <hi>fixing</hi> or <hi>freezing</hi> the waters. The alluſion is drawn from the operation of weavers, who <hi>warp,</hi> that is, <hi>fix</hi> their worſted or yarn in their looms before they work it."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0047702300:30"/>But, how is it certain that Shakeſpeare meant <hi>no more but</hi> fixing or <hi>freezing</hi>; when there is no proof that he meant even that: for, unleſs theſe criticks can produce the teſtimony of one Engliſh writer, or even one Engliſh <hi>weaver,</hi> to prove that the term <hi>warp,</hi> as related to the <hi>woof,</hi> is uſed as a verb, nobody can give into their notion of the alluſion.</p>
               <p>The following obſervation affords a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the modeſty and learning of theſe critical gentry:</p>
               <p>—"After all Mr. Kenrick's exultations at the diſcovery of the meaning of the word <hi>l'envoy,</hi> in <hi>Love's Labour loſt,</hi> his etymology is but fantaſtical; nor is it juſtified by the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voux Dictionary, which ſeems to be the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of his French learning."</p>
               <p>Indeed! — In the firſt place, Mr. Critick, you tell a notorious untruth in aſſerting a thing you know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of: you have looked, I ſuppoſe, into the <hi>Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire de Trevoux,</hi> and becauſe you cannot find ſuch etymology juſtified by that work, you flatly affirm it to be fantaſtical, and very logically conclude that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one Reviewer's French learning extends no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Trevoux Dictionary, another's muſt be confined to the ſame limits. It appears, however, that Mr. K. has at leaſt one dictionary more of French learning, as you call it, than you; for I find in one, that he put not long ſince into my hands, that his ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of the word <hi>envoy</hi> is there juſtified in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words:

               <p>I ſhall mention but one more of their criticiſms; as it contains either a proof of their ſaying only what other writers have ſaid before them, or of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs occaſionally to adopt the ſagacity of others in ſilence.</p>
               <q>We ſhall give him credit for his retaining the word <hi>knot</hi> in the ſame play; but we ſee no authority he has for ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the king to be a wounded knot, or bird, ſo called. When we reflect, that he ſteps aſide and conceals himſelf in a buſh, while he diſcovers the lovers, ſo as to be as invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as a <hi>gnat,</hi> the badneſs of the rhimes is removed by reading <hi>gnat</hi> inſtead of <hi>knot</hi>; but this is mere conjecture.</q>
               <p>It is really very good of theſe gentlemen to give ſuch a <hi>paultry obſerver</hi> as Mr. K. credit for any thing; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as they had nothing better to offer than mere conjecture. But the worſt on it is, that this conjecture was long ago conjectured by Mr. Pope, who adopted the ſame reading for the ſake of the rhime. This, however, it is poſſible theſe criticks on the critick of the editors of Shakeſpeare knew nothing at all about.</p>
               <p>I come now to the more ſerious part of the offence, which theſe criticks have both taken and given, with regard to Mr. K's performance. This is the paſſage immediately ſucceeding the above; in which, admitting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0047702300:32"/>
that Dr. J's note is a <hi>vile</hi> one, they proceed to inſinuate that Mr. K. in his reprehenſion of it, hath forfeited his pretenſions to <hi>honour, ſpirit</hi> and <hi>virtue.</hi> Nay, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, don't laugh; it is really the <hi>Critical</hi> Reviewers, who, in this very article, "have entered their caveat againſt <hi>illiberal</hi> criticiſm," and talk about <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi>; even thoſe, whoſe criticiſm hath heretofore been deemed l—s, and as ſuch puniſhed accordingly. You will ſay, perhaps, that they are reformed; that they have ſince authorized their printer to pay fifty pounds, out of his own pocket, to any perſon who can bring legal proof of their having taken money for the inſertion of partial characters of books and authors, although they own it has been offered them <note n="*" place="bottom">See their late advertiſement inſerted in the news-papers, as alſo on the cover of the Critical Review, wiſely to inform the country reader of the high eſteem in which the Reviewers were held in town. It is well for them, indeed, that their rage of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification did not induce them to promiſe a reward for proving the editor guilty of receiving and inſerting anonymous articles, which might, for ought he knew, be written by the authors of the books themſelves: becauſe, in this caſe, there might have been brought ſuch damning proof, as might have made them tremble for the offered premium.</note>. What an inſtance this laſt of their integrity, impartiality and <hi>virtue!</hi> — Very true, indeed, and I firmly believe that they never did take any pecuniary bribe on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for, though I am acquainted with many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary bookſellers, and as many vain authors, yet I don't know one, whom I think fool enough to value the beſt character they could give of his performance at three farthings. I will not contradict them poſitively indeed, and ſay that not one ſuch is to be found; but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0047702300:33"/>
it happens extremely unlucky that theſe criticks, in thinking to do themſelves honour, ſhould confeſs a thing that cannot fail to entail on them diſgrace. They own that money hath been offered them, though they had ſo much <hi>virtue</hi> as to refuſe to take it. Does not this circumſtance alone ſufficiently evince what opinion the perſons, offering the bribe, muſt have of thoſe to whom it was offered? — Oh! fie! fie! for ſhame! never make this confeſſion again, whether true or falſe, as you value your very exiſtence. <hi>Virtus poſt mortem</hi> may ſerve well enough for a motto to the atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a dead cheeſemonger; but the virtue even of a Critical Reviewer is not worth a groat to an author, who is damned while he is alive.</p>
               <p>For decency's ſake be a little conſiſtent; and, for the future, beware of extolling the works of ſtrangers to the ſkies, and of endeavouring afterwards to drag them down again, when you find ſuch writers know too much to be vain of your praiſes, and are too ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere to become your friends.

By refuſing to inſert them, however, they robbed the publick of an egregious entertainment; for it can hardly be doubted that the lovers of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, whom Mr. H. lately treated at a guinea a head, would be equally fond of the calipaſh of a roaſted hodmandod.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, however, in my tale; the poorneſs of the verſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was not the only fault that was found with the above ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas. Mr. H— inſiſted on it they were actionable at law, and therefore proceeded gravely to lay the following queries before council.</p>
                     <p>Query 1. Whether it be not actionable at law for a poet to call a printer a hodmandod?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If ſo, what method is moſt adviſable for the plaintiff to proceed in order to recover damages; and what damages a Middleſex jury might be reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give?</p>
                     <p>The anſwer to the above queries, as I am informed, were to the following purpoſe. "An action on the caſe will undoubtedly lie. —Fact proved; damages high, proviſo plaintiff proves hodman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dod a fiſh of prey, as the ſword-fiſh, the ſhark, or the like. Lord chancellor Bacon mentions it together with the tortoiſe; if the jury take it to be an eatable fiſh, damages not ſo high, unleſs not to be conveyed by land-carriage.

                  <p>Of the ingenuouſneſs, impartiality, and urbanity of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus Urban, Gent. regarding the writings of Mr. K. and particularly his Review of Dr. Johnſon's Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>EVERY body knows who was the original Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Urban, honeſt Cave, who, little as he knew of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature or ſcience himſelf, had yet ſo much knowledge and diſcretion as to ſet a juſt value on his friends and correſpondents, and behave to them at leaſt with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and common decency. When the neceſſity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of employing perſons of ſuperior genius and learning obliged him to lean on ſome right-hand-man, he could not always be accountable for what he was urged to do by others. In time Sylvanus Urban be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0047702300:36"/>
a mere ſhadow; and the good-will of his friends was liable to be perverted by the caprice, ignorance, or ill-will of his journeymen-editors. How far the preſent Sylvanus is his own friend, in admitting of ſuch a perverſion, time hath already evinced in ſome degree, and will daily exhibit more plainly. Before I proceed any farther, however, I ſhall inſert Mr. Urban's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Mr. K's Review.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>This piece is written with a malignity for which it is very difficult to account, as the authour declares that he is a ſtranger to Dr. Johnſon, and never received any offence from him. If his ill-will ariſes from envy of the literary honour Dr. Johnſon has acquired, or the mark of diſtinction he has received from his ſovereign, he is too much an object of pity to move any other paſſion in the breaſt either of Dr. Johnſon, or his friends <note n="*" place="bottom">If the writer of this paragraph ſuſpects Mr. K. of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned motives from any thing his own heart ſuggeſts to him, he is himſelf too much, and too mean a wretch to <hi>deſerve</hi> pity. And that he could have any other grounds, on which to form ſuch a ſuſpicion, he is called upon to make appear.</note>. He has treated the biſhop of Glouceſter with the ſame acrimony that he has treated Dr. Johnſon, yet he declares he has himſelf ſome literary reputation which he would not wantonly hazard, being the author of two tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the French, beſides ſeveral anonymous pieces, which, he ſays himſelf, are too numerous to be good <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>Is this true? — Is this a ſpecimen of Mr. Urban's ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impartiality and veracity? The truth is, that Mr. K. in the Preface to his Review, ſpeaking of his not ſtanding exactly in the ſame predicament with the author of the Canons of Criticiſm, who had never written any thing before that piece, thought it neceſſary to add the following note, which the reader will ſee Mr. Urban has not only mutilated and miſrepreſented, but hath given it the moſt invidious turn.</p>
                        <q>In confirmation of what is here aſſerted, it may poſſibly be thought neceſſary to name ſome of thoſe publications, on which the public have conferred the honour of a favourable reception.— It is preſumed needleſs, however, to particularize performances that would certainly have been leſs faulty, had they been leſs nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. The author contents himſelf, therefore, with men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning only his Epiſtles to Lorenzo<note n="*" place="bottom">Can any thing be more pitiful and mean than the omiſſion of the name of this work, with a view to repreſent Mr. K. as a mere tranſlator? It is alſo fooliſh as mean, for how long did this <hi>ingenuous</hi> critick think this expedient would ſerve him? Did he think, becauſe when Mr. K. was an anonymous writer, he deſpiſed theſe little artifices too much to take notice of them, that when he had by name attacked their <hi>chief,</hi> he would not take an opportunity to cruſh his pitiful dependents? Or did they imagine that, if Mr. K. ſhould think them beneath his reſentment, he would find none to join him in ſo good a cauſe? Could they conceive there was nobody who, while he was roaſting the coloſſus like an over-grown turkey-cock, for the entertainment of the publick, would take the trouble to ſpit a dozen or two of his emiſſaries, by way of larks, to garniſh the diſh withal: — This critick was miſtaken every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0047702300:37"/>This work conſiſts principally of ſeveral conjectures<note n="‡" place="bottom">This is notoriouſly falſe; Mr. K. having propoſed very few conjectures; his work conſiſting principally of rational illuſtrations of the poet, or proofs poſitive of the ignorance of his commentators.</note>, which he has ſubſtituted for the conjectures of the Biſhop and Dr. Johnſon, frequently with as much confidence as if they were truths received by revelation, and confirmed by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle <note n="§" place="bottom">Well, and what then? Why may not a writer ſpeak confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently when he is convinced he is in the right? And I don't find that either Mr. Urban, or any other of Dr. Johnſon's friends, will venture to go aboot to prove Mr. K. in the wrong. They may rail in general terms; but if they meddle with particulars, they will poſſibly only expoſe their own nakedneſs, and be laughed at with the Critical Reviewers.—But Mr. K. ſpeaks, ſays this <hi>maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziner,</hi> as if his criticiſms were truths
<q>received by revelation, and confirmed by miracle.</q>
If he received them by revelation, however, I preſume there was no manner of occaſion for his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them confirmed by miracle, to warrant his confidence. Their production was, nevertheleſs, ſo far miraculous, that they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in fewer days than Dr. Johnſon took years to compleat his work: a circumſtance which ſome wiſeacres, who never ſaw them, urged publickly, as a proof they could be good for nothing; becauſe, ſaid they,
<q>a man of moderate genius could not read the book in the time that Mr. K. <hi>ſtans pede in uno</hi> had produced a confutation of it.</q>
But while the juſtice of Mr. K's criticiſms in general remain inconteſtible, I leave the publick to judge, whether the rapidity of their compoſition redounds moſt to his credit or his diſhonour.</note>; of theſe we ſhall give ſuch a ſpecimen as will
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0047702300:38"/>
enable the reader to judge of the reſt, beginning where the author begins, that our impartiality may not be brought into queſtion.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Would not any indifferent perſons, who ſhould read the above paſſage, imagine at leaſt that the writer of it never once heard of the Reviewer, or his writings, in his life? But are not Dr. H—h and Mr. H—y the editors and managers of the Gentleman's Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine? And is it poſſible that neither of theſe gentlemen remember that Mr. K. hath been an occaſional contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butor to their work from a very ſchool-boy? And is this a ſpecimen of the manners with which they treat a correſpondent, for whom they have more than once expreſſed the higheſt regard; and for whoſe <hi>valuable contributions</hi> (as they have called them) they have even offered pecuniary gratifications, which he never conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to accept? I have now in my hands ſufficient proofs of what is here intimated, and the Gentleman's Magazine affords various others of the <hi>acknowledged</hi> value of the papers Mr. K. hath ſent it, reſpecting very different branches of ſcience and literature.</p>
               <p>Can the managers of that work be ſo mean and ſelf-intereſted, as to treat Mr. K. in this ſcandalous manner, becauſe he has of late years been induced to favour other periodical works of the like kind? They can have no other motive, unleſs it be their cloſer attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Dr. J. But, however they may have been
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0047702300:39"/>
obliged to that gentleman, and whatever opinion they may have of his literary abilities, are candour, truth and juſtice, all to give way to their partiality for him? Are the talents and reputations of the Doctors Johnſon and H—h ſo very bulky, that thoſe both of the dead and the living muſt be mangled, mutilated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in order to allow them room enough to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour in? Surely the recent loſs of a <hi>Lloyd</hi> and a <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chill</hi> might have rendered them a <hi>little</hi> more at eaſe in ſo wide a world! But, no. They are determined to have the univerſe to themſelves and their partizans; condemning every one to defamation or obſcurity, who does not enliſt under the banner of the coloſſus <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Among numerous inſtances that might be brought of Mr. Urban's miſbehaviour in this kind to Mr. K. I ſhall only mention two or three; which, though beneath his own notice, may ſerve as a ſpecimen of thoſe <hi>little arts,</hi> by which ſome modern writers have wriggled themſelves into fame, and endeavoured to obſcure the dawning reputation of others. It is remarkable that the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine hath of late years carefully avoided mentioning the very name of Mr. K. though formerly pleaſed to print it in large capitals to a puerile and inſignificant performance, inſerted ſo long ago as the year 1748.—He hath been as cautious alſo of mentioning the <hi>Epiſtles to Lorenzo,</hi> a work of eſtabliſhed credit, not only in the pitiful inſtance before-given, but even in his liſt of books at the time of its publication.—When he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alſo lately to reprint the fable, entitled, <hi>Reaſon and Imagination,</hi> (written by the CELEBRATED <hi>Mr. Chriſtopher Smart,</hi> as he himſelf ſtiles that gentleman) and addreſſed to Mr. K. he judged it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient even to mutilate that piece, in order to omit the addreſs, as well as the following elegant compliment which is paid to Mr. K. at the concluſion.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>At another time this editor promiſed his readers an abſtract of what he called a <hi>very ſenſible</hi> anonymous pamphlet, written by Mr. K. but, having learned the name of the author before the next month's magazine appeared, he ſomehow forgot his promiſe, and poſſibly has not recollected it to this day. And yet, during all this time, not the ſlighteſt occaſion was neglected in which Mr. Urban could compliment Dr. Johnſon or Dr. Hawkſworth. But I fear my readers are ſufficiently diſguſted at the recapitulation of ſuch minute and pitiful artifices, which are as diſgraceful to the profeſſion of letters in general, as to thoſe who practiſe them in particular.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould otherwiſe mention ſome more ſerious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant cauſes of complaint, proceeding obviouſly from the ſame ſource, which Mr. K. hath farther to exhibit againſt the editor and manager of this magazine.—</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0047702300:40"/>They are here given to know, however, that Mr. K. deteſts all combinations in literature, as much as he deſpiſes the monopoliſts of fame. Let thoſe, who find themſelves unable to ſtand alone, combine to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other. Mr. K. will go hand in hand with any fair and open enquirer after literary or ſcientific improvement: but he is neither ſo young and weak as to need the help of leading-ſtrings, nor ſo old and feeble as to require the aſſiſtance of crutches. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Urban pretends, even after thus throwing out the moſt infamous and groundleſs inſinuations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the motives for Mr. K's Review, to ſelect ſuch a ſpecimen of it, as may enable the reader to judge of the reſt, without calling his impartiality in queſtion.

But can any thing be more flagrant than the above inſtances of falſhood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, and miſrepreſentation? And yet it would be rude, indecent and unmannerly, I warrant ye, to charge Mr. Sylvanus Urban with telling <hi>wilful lies</hi> on this occaſion. Yet are they any better? Modern politeneſs, you will ſay, requires me to ſuit my ſtile to the delicacy of the offender, rather than to the enormity of the crime. Well then, I tell you Dr. H—h "you are a fibber, ſo you are, you, naughty man you, and I won't love you, nor will I give you any more marmalade or panada, ſo I won't,"—Will this pleaſe? or is it not ſufficiently gentle and <hi>candid</hi>?</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0047702300:42"/>As to the inſinuations themſelves, they are indeed too invidious and contemptible to require any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer than may be deduced from the foregoing pages of this defence.

                     <p>Not that the word <hi>charity</hi> is the moſt proper term to give to penſions beſtowed on thoſe who have repeatedly repreſented them as the wages of iniquity. But as I am willing to treat Dr. J. with all poſſible tenderneſs, I would not give it ſo ſevere a name, as is done by his pretended friends, who repreſent it as a ſort of huſh-money; a kind of retaining fee, to prevent him engaging his pen in oppoſite intereſts. But, if this be the caſe, what is it better than a ſpecies of bribery and corruption? And how does this differ from the wages of iniquity, except that ſuch wages are are received without being earned? A mighty indelicate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after all, for a man of ſuch conſummate VIRTUE! — But I cannot cloſe this note, without taking ſome notice of what is advanced on this ſubject, by the ſeveral <hi>virtuous</hi> critics who have cenſured Mr. K's performance.</p>
                     <p>They ſay Mr. K's great quarrel with Dr. J. appears to be the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's accepting a penſion; and yet they intimate the former would be glad of an opportunity of accepting one himſelf. But, pray, if theſe gentry know nothing of Mr. K as they pretend, how can they take upon them to ſay he would be ſo glad of a penſion? And if they do know any thing of him, they muſt know at the ſame time, that, notwithſtanding Dr. J's <hi>bon mot</hi>

Beſides, the caſe is not parallel; for though a penſion might be acceptable to Mr. K. (and to whom, pray, would it not?) he never railed at penſions, nor abuſed placemen and penſioners in his life; and, if it were offered him, could receive it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſervices done, or at leaſt intended to be done, to his country. But how a man of Dr. J's known political principles could receive it without a bluſh, and at the ſame time pretend to <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>virtue,</hi> is what I cannot conceive.</p>

How would that ſarcaſtic ſpirit avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on this piddling critick!</note>.

               <p>If any of Dr.J's partizans think they can defend him, in the late outrage he hath committed againſt the memory and reputation of Shakeſpeare, let them ſtand forth boldly, and they ſhall be received like men.

               <argument>
                  <p>Remarks on the ſtrictures of the Candid Reviewers, and the other volunteer criticks that have taken upon them to abuſe the Reviewer of Dr. J's Shakeſpeare.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is ſomething remarkable that, among all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who have drawn the pen on the preſent occaſion, againſt Mr. K. not one of them hath ventured to take the part of Dr. J. The <hi>critical</hi> Reviewers, we have ſeen, give him up entirely; even Mr. Urban himſelf ſays nothing in his defence. The pretended acrimony of Mr. K's manner, indeed, is diſapproved by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but this I have already endeavoured to juſtify. I ſhall proceed, therefore, to enquire how far thoſe, which are as yet unnoticed, are juſtifiable in <hi>their</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of treating Mr. K.—To begin with the <hi>Candid</hi> Reviewers. Theſe <hi>honeſt</hi> gentlemen, who have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the whole of Mr. K's preface, as they did the month before the greater part of Dr. J's, have given ſuch an inconſiſtent and motley account of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer</hi>'s performance, that it is very difficult to ſay whether they have moſt praiſed or cenſured it.</p>
               <p>In its <hi>favour</hi> they ſometimes admit, that "the matter of it does demand the higheſt approbation." That "Dr. Johnſon will find himſelf <hi>unable</hi> to reply to it."—That "Mr. Kenrick has very ſufficiently ſhewn that Dr. Johnſon has played booty throughout his boaſted edition."—That "Mr. K. hath improved upon Dr. J."—That "they agree with Mr. K. that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0047702300:46"/>
Shakeſpeare ſtill ſtands as much in need of a new edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ever."—That "he hath happily ſucceeded in giving, by means of an eaſy interpretation, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent meaning to ſeveral paſſages, in regard to which other interpreters have run after far-fetched explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."—That "they entirely agree with him in the ſimple ſenſe he gives to words, and join with him in wondering how Warburton and others could ever puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle themſelves ſo much about them," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In its <hi>disfavour,</hi> they inſinuate that "Mr. K. has Committed blunders as well as other men, who bragged as much, witneſs poor Dr. Warburton."—That "Mr. K. has ſometimes miſapprehended his author's meaning, as well as Dr. Johnſon."—That "future obſervers will improve on Mr. K, and that he is therefore not fit to publiſh an edition of Shakeſpeare."—That "Mr. K. inſtead of profiting by his own admonitions, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times commits the ſame faults he blames in others."— That they cannot help expreſſing "their admiration at the bleſſed effects which metaphyſics and philoſophy have upon criticiſm in poetry!" intimating thereby that Mr. K. is too much of a philoſopher to know any thing of poetry.—That Mr. K. diſplays great inability in tracing out the beauty of poetic images, and that his remarks are ridiculous.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter upon a confutation of the aſſertions of theſe critics; the inſtances in which they preſume to differ from Mr. K. being, to the laſt degree, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and contemptible; as the reader may conclude from their affirming, in the courſe of their critical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, that Shakeſpeare had no knowledge of a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0047702300:47"/>
                  <hi>climax,</hi> which they are pleaſed to term a rhetorical gorgon-faced word. They have ſagaciouſly diſcovered alſo that Shakeſpeare acted, with <hi>very little</hi> judgment, in the execution of one of his greateſt maſter-pieces of art. But this is ſufficient with regard to their lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſtrictures: I come now to their perſonal ones; and here they charge Mr. K. with having deſcended to make uſe of "ſcurrility, abuſive and even low-lived <note n="*" place="bottom">Does not this polite epithet ſerve to ſhew, that the writer himſelf muſt undoubtedly be a perſon in <hi>high-life? Ex ungue leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> This critic, to ſpeak in his own dialect, muſt certainly be a gentleman of <hi>three cuts.</hi> Low-lived!

If any charitable hand will do it for him, it muſt be ſteeped well in the acrimony of Mr. K's Review. That may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly keep it awhile above-ground. But alas! what pickle can long preſerve a body, that, for want of proper ſtamina, never was wholly alive; and, by the time it was half dead, was quite rotten!

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0047702300:48"/>
like dogs and bears," and finally with "being a whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, lynx-eyed, critico-poetico-metaphyſico-magico philoſopher."</p>
               <p>The reader will judge for himſelf how far a ſet of critics, who are ſo admirably well ſkilled in calling names, are to be credited in charging any writer with <hi>ſcurrility, petulance, ribaldry</hi> and <hi>foul-language</hi>; words, I can aſſure him, that are not to be found in Mr. K's Review! But it is not only againſt ſuch critics, as pretend to have read his performance, that Mr. K. hath juſt cauſe of complaint. There are thoſe who condemn both him and his Review, without ſeeing or knowing any thing of either, except what is told them by Dr. Johnſon's partizans. Nay, ſeveral of theſe <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> gentry began to rail openly in the public news-papers, at ſight of Mr. K's advertiſement only. The terms of this, truly, were highly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; it was a kind of high-treaſon, a ſpecies of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, even to imagine Dr. Johnſon could be <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>inattentive.</hi> One would have thought him placed at the head of literature, as the Roman pontiff is at the head of his church, and with the ſame pretenſions to infallibility. Every body, forſooth, was expected to kiſs pope Johnſon's toe, even at the hazard of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fore-teeth kicked out by his holineſs's bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But Mr. K. had never any inclination to be treated in ſo groſs a manner, as that in which he had heard Dr. J. had taken the liberty to behave towards ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the firſt rank in the world of ſcience and letters. It was reſerved for him, indeed, to pay the doctor in his own coin, and avenge the repeated inſults received
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0047702300:49"/>
by injured modeſty. To appeal to fact, however, in ſupport of what is above aſſerted, Mr. K's Review was hardly publiſhed before a letter, ſigned <hi>J. May,</hi> appeared in the London Chronicle, evidently founded on the advertiſement only, in which Mr. K. was charged in groſs terms with making uſe of FOUL-MOUTHED <hi>language,</hi> of want of <hi>decency, good-manners,</hi> and I know not what.—What a <hi>fine-mouthed,</hi> ſmooth-tongued, poliſhed generation is the preſent! This Mr. Sweet-lips was pleaſed to ſay, "Whatever judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the public may entertain of the late edition of Shakeſpeare, the editor is too well known, to have the charge of ignorance ſo eaſily admitted againſt him."— Doubtleſs he is; and it would in no ſhape have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Reviewer's end for the public to have been ſatisfied by his advertiſement without reading his book.—By the readineſs, however, with which Mr. May, and indeed all Dr. J's friends, ſeem to give up the editor of Shakeſpeare, there is great reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume Mr. K. did not promiſe more in the news-papers than he effected in his pamphlet. So that it appears Dr. J. is not ſo well <hi>known</hi> as this gentleman ſuppoſes. His name, indeed, is in every body's mouth, and it is poſſible there are few of thoſe, whom, from their fondneſs for <hi>fine writers,</hi> we may with propriety enough call <hi>fine readers,</hi> who have not yawned with drowſy admiration over thoſe quaint and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid performances, <hi>Irene</hi> and the <hi>Idler.</hi> But theſe works ſupport but a ſmall part of Dr. Johnſon's literary reputation: the foundation of which is laid ſo deep in the rubbiſh of erudition, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0047702300:50"/>
for ſuch ſuperficial readers to diſcover it. Like the ſpectator of the inviſible cock, however, Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſeems to be very ſure it is there.—This ſame Mr. J. May, alſo, takes farther upon him to aſk
<q>who is this W. K. who ſo rudely ſteps forth from — nobody knows where, to attack a gentleman of known literary abilities?</q>
—This gentleman muſt have very few connections, and know little of what is doing, in the literary world, to have any occaſion to aſk ſuch a queſtion. For, whoever <hi>he</hi> be, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>he</hi> comes from, Mr. K. may certainly ſay with propriety to HIM, <hi>Not to know me argues thyſelf unknown.</hi> But perhaps this gentleman, like the editor of Lloyd's Chronicle, and ſome other writers, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, on the like occaſion, to ſpeak of <hi>one Mr. K.</hi> as if an utter ſtranger to his exiſtence, may only know him too well, having before ſmarted from the juſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his critical pen. If ſo, Mr. May is anſwered; if not, and he was really deſirous of knowing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Mr. K. he may have, in ſome meaſure, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his curioſity in the peruſal of the foregoing ſheets.</p>
               <p>The next gentleman I ſhall take notice of (which ſhall be the laſt, as there would be no end of purſuing anonymous writers) is one Mr. Hypercriticus, who, about the ſame time, without ever having ſeen Mr. K's book, was incited to publiſh, among other ſagacious reflections, the following wiſe ſentences.
<q>From the very ſhort time ſince the publication of Mr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's edition of Shakeſpeare, and from the very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0047702300:51"/>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Another of Dr. J's friends is angry with Mr. K. for a like reaſon, remarking, as before obſerved, that Mr. K. <hi>ſtans pede in uno</hi> wrote his Review of Dr. Johnſon's book, before a perſon of a moderate capacity could read it.—But if Mr. K. is generally in the right, and Dr. J. in the wrong, I don't ſee how this reflects any diſgrace on the former. On the contrary, if Mr. K. <hi>ſtans pede in uno</hi> hath given ſuch a broad-footed coloſſus as Dr. J. a fall, it ſhews him to be no bad wreſtler. So ſtand clear, if you are upon the <hi>offenſive.</hi>—</note> progreſs of Mr. Kenrick's remarks thereon, I <hi>believe</hi> they muſt be crude and imperfect.</q> Believe! quoth he, Is not this very candid and ingenuous? But he proceeds to give a reaſon for the faith that is in him.
<q>For to paſs a right judgment on books (ſays Longinus) requires a great length of time, and a perfect knowledge of the ſubject.</q>
Well, and what then? The writings of Shakeſpeare might have been the object of Mr. K's ſtudy for years, and he might thence have acquired (at leaſt for what Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticus knew to the contrary) a perfect knowledge of the ſubject; and if ſo, no longer time would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for him to point out Dr. Johnſon's miſtakes, than was neceſſary to read his book. But, ſays this gentleman,
<q>I <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> Mr. K. is a critick by intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; one who, in regard to books, ſees into the merit of the whole, by reading only a part.</q>
As we had before a <hi>believe</hi> here we have a <hi>ſuppoſe.</hi> Are not theſe very pretty grounds to proceed on, to the condemnation of a writer unread. But how, if what I juſt now aſſerted be true, that Shakeſpeare's writings have been many years the favourite object of Mr. K's reading and ſtudy; how, if he hath long ſince accumulated materials for an edition of that poet, as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0047702300:52"/>
is alſo true; I ſay, how, Mr. Hypercriticus, in this caſe, can you juſtify your precipitate cenſures, and what becomes of your <hi>ſuppoſe</hi>? And to ſuppoſe for once it was not ſo, ſurely Mr. K. might, as you ſay, judge of the <hi>whole</hi> by reading a <hi>part,</hi> with as much propriety as you judge of his performance by reading only his advertiſement in the news-papers? Why might not he be, without a <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> a critick intuitively as well as you? But "ſarcaſm, you ſay, is unmannerly." I wiſh, that where you learned to be ſo very <hi>mannerly,</hi> you had only learned alſo to be equally <hi>ingenuous</hi>; you would have ſaved me the trouble, and yourſelf the mortification, of this reprehenſion. I ſay the ſame to all the reſt of the mannerly, candid, decent, delicate partizans of Dr. Johnſon, who have, on this occaſion, been attempting to box in mufflers, or throwing dirt with their gloves on. As to the former, Mr. K. is too hardy to feel their puny efforts to offend him; and, as to the latter he cannot help ſmiling to ſee, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily their pellets dry and rub out, while they themſelves are begrimed up to the ears, in vainly endeavouring to beſpatter him.</p>
               <p>Having now done with particular altercation, I ſhould here leave both Mr. K. and Dr. J. to ſtand or fall by the judgment of the publick, had there not been ſome ſtrictures let fall in ſome of the papers levelled againſt Mr. K. charging him with as great a want of <hi>modeſty,</hi> as he hath done Dr. J. with want of <hi>knowledge.</hi> I ſhall therefore beg leave to ſay a word or two on both theſe topicks, viz. on the <hi>modeſty of men of letters,</hi> and on <hi>literary knowledge.</hi>

                  <p>On the modeſty of men of letters.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OF all kinds of <hi>modeſty,</hi> whether real or affected, perhaps that of <hi>Authors</hi> is the moſt ſingular. <hi>A modeſt Author</hi>! It is a kind of contradiction in terms, and ſounds to my ear exactly like the expreſſion of a <hi>modeſt ſtrumpet.</hi> There is no doubt that a man may be a modeſt man before he commence writer, as a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be an honeſt gentleman before he be made miniſter-of-ſtate, or as even a butcher may have ſome bowels of compaſſion before he turn bum-bailiff; but no ſooner are they initiated into the <hi>routine</hi> of their reſpective offices, than modeſty, honeſty, and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity take flight and leave them.</p>
               <p>This is ſevere, you will ſay.—It is ſo; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs founded in truth, and may be applied to many writers now living, and probably likely to live ſo long as they can get any thing by proſtituting either their talents or reputation.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that a cloſer parallel can hardly be drawn between any two known characters, than between a common ſcribbler and a common ſtrumpet. How baſhfully doth the young enamorato of the muſes look at you, when you ſpeak to him about publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his firſt production; even as an innocent country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench bluſhes up to the eyes, when you firſt talk of untying her garter! But when they have been a while tumbled over in the ſheets, the virgin-modeſty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0047702300:54"/>
of both is pretty equal. There is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, indeed, that the one grows bold by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reputation, and the other by gaining it. This difference, however, does not in the leaſt alter their conduct or appearance when they come upon the town: the reputation then aimed at by both, being very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what they either loſt or gained. The one ſeeks not to improve his talents any more than the other her charms; but both apply aſſiduouſly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play and make the moſt of what they poſſeſs; and if they covet fame, it is generally with a ſecondary view to the venal purpoſes of proſtitution <note n="*" place="bottom">Thus an author, whoſe abilities are exhauſted, and a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezan, whoſe charms are decayed, may ſtill live upon the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ariſing from their fame. Let them but get their names recorded in a <hi>Race</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">See a poem ſo called, in which Dr. J. is celebrated, among other things, for his <hi>modeſty</hi>; and in like manner Paul V—t, who wears a little ſmart bob, is deſcribed as overwhelmed by a wig more tremendous than Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahoy's.</note>, or a <hi>Meretriciad,</hi> and they may ſtill remain the favourites of purblind fops and ſuperficial witlings.</note>. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſuch characters can have any real modeſty, however neceſſary they may find it to aſſume its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, artfully to impoſe on the world?</p>
               <p>Not but that there are degrees, both in venality and impudence; ſo that as a <hi>demi-rep</hi> may be <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> modeſt and diſintereſted, ſo may an <hi>author.</hi> But to drop the compariſon; as there are many writers of a more liberal ſtamp than to come under any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that will rank them in this parallel; writers, who, while they labour to inſtruct and entertain the publick, labour equally to improve themſelves, and to render their future writings more valuable from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0047702300:55"/>
given to the preſent, I muſt own I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thinking that ſuch writers debaſe themſelves greatly, whenever they affect the falſe modeſty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced tyros, or deſigning ignorants. There is a ſpecies of aſſurance in men of real knowledge, which may be ſaid, without impropriety, to be conſiſtent with the modeſty becoming their character, as they could not poſſibly diveſt themſelves of it without evident hypocriſy and affectation. As to authors by profeſſion, they muſt neceſſarily either diſplay their aſſurance by inſiſting on their own merit, or, in fact, confeſs themſelves bunglers, or impoſtors. And indeed why ſhould they not? If an artiſt diſcover any mode of mechanical operation, or execute a piece of mechaniſm, which is an improvement on what others have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, or what nobody can execute but himſelf, who charges him with want of modeſty in boldly aſſerting his own pre-eminence? Why then ſhould a critick, a philoſopher, an hiſtorian, or a poet, be thought too aſſuming in laying publick claim to that merit, which they actually poſſeſs? What ſhould we think of an artizan or manufacturer, who ſhould, in his advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſhop-bills, <hi>modeſtly</hi> affect a diffidence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to give his cuſtomers ſatisfaction, having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a mean opinion of his own abilities? Should we not conclude, without heſitation, that he was either a knave or fool, or both? Yet how common is it to meet with authors, who have been many years <hi>in trade,</hi> ridiculouſly affecting to think meanly of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, which they nevertheleſs importunately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude on the publick, and make us pay for at as high
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0047702300:56"/>
a price as poſſible? Yet many of theſe writers have the character of being modeſt men. In my opinion, however, I think it an inſtance of very great <hi>impudence,</hi> to ſay no worſe of it, for a man to offer me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity at a great price, and to tell me at the ſame time he thinks it good for little. For what is this, in fact, but to tell me that he thinks me as great a fool as he confeſſes himſelf to be a knave?</p>
               <p>And yet, if a writer were to uſe the ſame arguments in the preface of his book, to ſet off his works to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as an artizan or manufacturer is allowed to do his, in his ſhop or warehouſe, he would of courſe be condemned for want of <hi>modeſty.</hi> Thus we ſee a very modeſt man may incur the obloquy of being an impudent author; and a very impudent author acquire the reputation of being a modeſt man.</p>
               <p>The true ſtate of this matter ſeems to be this. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and impudence as generally go together as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and modeſty; but ignorance being often the companion, and ſometimes even the guardian, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, it is no wonder that impudence ſhould put on the appearance of modeſty, in order to make us take mere ignorance for pure innocence.</p>
               <p>Knowledge as naturally inſpires fortitude, as truth abominates hypocriſy. How abſurd is it then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire men of real abilities to affect that diffidence and ignorance to which they muſt neceſſarily be ſtrangers! At the ſame time, what can we think of thoſe writers, who, after being long hackneyed in the ways of men, and of their profeſſion; who, after ſetting themſelves up even at the head of that profeſſion, pretend
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0047702300:57"/>
                  <hi>to tremble while they write,</hi> to <hi>bow down with reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial awe to ſuperior learning,</hi> to <hi>kiſs the rod of correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. What, I ſay, can we think of ſuch writers, but that, ſenſible of their own ignorance or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity, they are cajoling the publick in a manner that deſerves the name of the higheſt <hi>impudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much more modeſt and manly is it for a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of years and experience, to aſſert boldly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently what he hath good reaſon to think he knows <note n="*" place="bottom">And if he has not ſuch reaſon, he ſhould not trouble the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with his reveries.</note>; and openly to defy every groundleſs imputation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation of ignorance.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT hath been frequently obſerved, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>words</hi> is not the knowledge of <hi>things.</hi> Indeed the diſtinction between the <hi>ſcholar</hi> and the man of <hi>ſcience</hi> is now become general. It is nevertheleſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a man cannot be a conſiderable proficient in philology, particularly with regard to the modern languages, without having made ſome acquiſitions in ſcience. It is not my intent, however, to expatiate here on this diſtinction, or to enhance the preference due to ſcience above mere literature; my intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0047702300:58"/>
only to throw out a few ſhort obſervations on li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary knowledge in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Be not vain of thy learning, child, ſaid my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to me when I was a boy; I have lived to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get more than thou haſt learned in thy whole life.</q>
All this was very true; and yet I thought myſelf, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, as good a ſcholar as my grandfather: for when we were ſometimes both at a loſs for a word or two of Greek, I found the only difference between us was, that I turned to the Lexicon for thoſe I never knew, and he for thoſe he could not remember: but my <hi>copia verborum</hi> was nevertheleſs equal to his.</p>
               <p>Now it would be a matter of ſome importance to determine, whether a man can with propriety be ſaid to know what he cannot remember, even though he ſhould have formerly had it perfectly impreſſed in his memory?</p>
               <p>I am afraid that we ſhall go nigh to be laughed at by the vulgar, ſhould we admit that a man may be ſaid to know what he hath forgot, and can't tell us if we ask him. And yet, if he ſhould recollect it half-an-hour hence, without any body's telling him in the mean time, ſurely he muſt have had ſuch knowledge in him at the time of his being asked; ſince it does not appear that he had by any external means acquired it ſince.</p>
               <p>This would afford a curious and ſubtle diſquſition; but, as I have not time to enter here into a profound inveſtigation of all the difficulties that ſuggeſt themſelves concerning it, I ſhall only make an application of it to the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0047702300:59"/>
learning of the two laſt editors of Shakeſpeare, and leave the reader to make it out as well as he can.</p>
               <p>Mr. K. hath proved, in ſeveral parts of his Review of Dr. J's edition, that the ſaid editor either did not then know, or had forgot the meaning of ſeveral words and paſſages, which it is plain the Doctor muſt have formerly known, and probably would have recollected ſome odd time or other. I ſhall inſtance only one or two. In one the very learned Doctors J. and W. both appear not to know the meaning of the word <hi>convene</hi>; Dr. W. objecting to Shakeſpeare's proper uſe of it, and Dr. J. adopting the ſaid objection: and yet Mr. K. hath juſtified Shakeſpeare, and convicted both the editors on the authority of Dr. J's own Dictionary.</p>
               <p>Again, in regard to the uſe of the old phraſe, <hi>taken with the manner,</hi> both theſe learned editors flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelves; aſſerting in one volume that it is uſed one way, and in another volume that it is uſed differently.</p>
               <p>I might mention many other inſtances of the like kind; but theſe will ſuffice for my preſent purpoſe. What I want to know is, whether theſe are inſtances of <hi>ignorance</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>Dr. J's friends will ſay, "O, no — he certainly knew better." Knew better? when? What, when he was told of the blunder, I ſuppoſe? Surely that man may juſtly be called <hi>ignorant,</hi> whoſe knowledge, how great ſoever, is out of the way when it is wanted!</p>
               <p>Will it be ſaid, theſe are not inſtances of <hi>ignorance</hi> but <hi>inattention?</hi> Pray what is <hi>inattention?</hi> Do you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0047702300:60"/>
mean to ſay that the Doctor did not read theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, or that he read them when he was aſleep?</p>
               <p>If he read them, and was wide awake, theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes could never have happened from <hi>inattention,</hi> but muſt have been derived from <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi>; which, according to the arguments above adduced, muſt be a ſpecies at leaſt of <hi>ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the criticks will poſſibly aſk me, what I mean by being <hi>wide awake,</hi> and by Dr. J's <hi>reading</hi> theſe paſſages? They will ſay, perhaps, that they know as well as I, that, when a commentator reads a paſſage over, he muſt comprehend it ſome way or other, right or wrong; and that no <hi>inattention,</hi> in that caſe, can prevent the operation of his judgment reſpecting the words that lie before him; ſo that, if he then miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, it muſt be through <hi>ignorance.</hi>
                  <q>But this was not the caſe; (it may be ſaid) Dr. J. could never dream that Dr. W. could be miſtaken ſo grosſly in matters ſo clear and obvious, and therefore copied thoſe paſſages implicitly from Dr. W's Comment: ſo that it was nothing more than <hi>inattention.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Call you this method of proceeding <hi>inattention?</hi> It is ſuch <hi>wilful negligence,</hi> that your friend Dr. J. will hardly be obliged to you for thus defending him from the charge of <hi>ignorance</hi>; for ſurely, if we may not call it want of <hi>knowledge,</hi> we muſt call it want of— ſomething elſe, which a man of acknowledged <hi>virtue</hi> ſhould not be without. What would a ſimilar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to this, be called in any of the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of life? Happy is it, undoubtedly, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent race of authors, that they ALL, <hi>being penſioned,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0047702300:61"/>
can ſubſiſt and provide for their families, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to publiſh their works by ſubſcription; for, after ſuch flagrant inſtances of <hi>inattention,</hi> and that in a writer of the firſt reputation for learning and <hi>virtue,</hi> what encouragement can any other, of leſs note, or leſs reputed virtue, ever hope to meet with?</p>
               <p>The late Mr. Fielding, ſpeaking ſomewhere of thoſe gentlemen, who had tied themſelves up, as it was then called, from ſubſcribing to works of genius and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, expreſſes his reſentment againſt them, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is a pity they were not tied up in good earneſt; but what do thoſe authors deſerve, who firſt gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for people entering into ſuch illiberal engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p>And what doth Dr. J. in particular deſerve, for having obtruded on the world the worſt Commentary of Shakeſpeare that ever appeared? and, at the ſame time, for having, by his procraſtination and neglect, ſo effectually diſguſted the publick with editors and ſubſcriptions, that it is preſumed the ableſt commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the kingdom would find little encouragement for a ſimilar undertaking? notwithſtanding, as the criticks juſtly obſerve, SHAKESPEARE <hi>ſtands</hi> NOW <hi>in more need of a</hi> NEW EDITION <hi>than ever.</hi>

            <p>I Cannot help thinking it a little fortunate, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that your obſervations on Mr. K's Review ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the printer had quite finiſhed the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſheets; as it affords me an opportunity of adding a word or two, by way of reply, to your obſervations on his <hi>extraordinary</hi> Review. It is indeed not without reaſon you give it that appellation; but, pray, do you mean thereby to inſinuate that nobody hath a right to make uſe of the word <hi>Review</hi> but yourſelves? Have you an excluſive privilege to it, like that which is laid to the <hi>Poſt,</hi> or to the <hi>Gazette</hi>?</p>
            <p>It is true, that you <hi>monthly</hi> gentlemen have the right of prior occupancy over your periodical rivals; who deal, like yourſelves, in the wholeſale branch of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. But, becauſe you are wholeſale dealers, are you therefore to be monopolizers? Muſt every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view extraordinary be ſtigmatized as an extraordinary Review, becauſe it is not fabricated or vended in your work-ſhop or warehouſe?</p>
            <p>It was, doubtleſs, horridly provoking, to have your work taken out of your hands, and diſpatched, while
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0047702300:63"/>
you were whetting your edge-tools. But why, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, find fault with the tools of another artizan, whoſe work you do not ſeem to diſapprove ſo much, as his manner of executing it? Surely Dr. J. might as well ſuffer by a Tomahawk as a cleaver! Is it not as well to be ſcalped by a Mohawk, as to be knocked on the head, or have one's throat cut, by a carcaſe-butcher? And pray, how do you differ from the ſanguinary aſſaſſins of White-chapel and Cow-croſs, except that yours are intellectual, and theirs are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal victims? They only mangle the body. You mortify the very ſoul; and muſt expect to be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in turn. For let me tell you, in the firſt place, that even your witty conceit of comparing Mr. K. to a Mohawk or a Cherokee, will never be thought your own, by thoſe who recollect the Cherokees and Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois that Biſhop W. is charged with having ſet on the back of Dr. Lowth. You critical gentlemen ſeem indeed to be all terribly miſtaken with regard to the place of Mr. K's nativity. The <hi>Critical</hi> Reviewers and Chroniclers declared him to be a <hi>Tartar,</hi> and you inſiſt upon his being a Mohawk or a Cherokee Indian. It is a pretty long poſt-ſtage from the deſarts of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the wilds of America. We know, indeed, that you ſpeak metaphorically, and, tho' far-fetched, ſo far it is excuſable; but let us ſee if the hyperbole is not to be found among your other tropes and figures. You ſay
<q>the <hi>Reviewer</hi> (Mr. K.) ſeems to be one of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent aſſailants, whoſe aim is not merely to vanquiſh, but even to <hi>exterminate</hi> his antagoniſt.</q>
It is well you put in that qualifying <hi>ſeems.</hi> But you ſay poſitively,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0047702300:64"/>
that he endeavours to expoſe his antagoniſt as a very <hi>pretender</hi> to all literature and ſcience.</p>
            <p>This, you ſay, is quite outrageous.—And ſo it might be, were it ſtrictly true; but you will pleaſe to obſerve, Mr. K. does not <hi>poſitively deny</hi> that Dr. Johnſon is maſter of the languages and ſciences; he only ſays, it <hi>does not appear</hi> ſo to <hi>him.</hi> Who knows but Mr. K. might here modeſtly intend to inſinuate his own inability to comprehend the amazing ſtores and vaſt profundity of Dr. Johnſon's ſcience and eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Why then would you not give him credit for the appearance of being in ſo mild and promiſing a diſpoſition <note n="*" place="bottom">And that theſe criticks might juſtly have done it, had they been inclined to ſhew Mr. K. fair play, will appear ſufficiently from the paſſage hinted at, with the note he hath annexed. "I do not ſay," ſays Mr. K.
<q>that Dr. Johnſon may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be well ſkilled in <hi>ſome</hi> things; not that <hi>I know</hi> that he is well ſkilled in any <note n="*" place="bottom">I will except, indeed, the article of <hi>literary compoſition</hi>; in which, ſo far as the merit of a ſpeech, an eſſay, a life, or a novel, goes, he is undoubtedly the beſt writer in Chriſtendom.</note>; for, though I have read <hi>all</hi> his <hi>works,</hi> I declare he does not <hi>appear to me</hi> (at leaſt ſo far as I myſelf am able to judge) to be <hi>maſter</hi> of any <hi>one ſcience,</hi> or any <hi>one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi> Not that I <hi>deny</hi> him to be maſter of the <hi>whole circle of ſciences,</hi> and of <hi>all languages ancient and modern.</hi>
                  </q>
—Surely, Mr. Monthly Reviewer, it is you that are <hi>outrageous</hi>! for Mr. K. ſpeaks here with becoming modeſty and diffidence.</note>? Be this, however, as it may, you are certainly miſtaken in ſuppoſing that Mr. K. hath queſtioned the abilities of Dr. J. as a man of ſcience, a critick and philologiſt, merely becauſe the Doctor, as you ſay, miſtook his talents in undertaking an edition of Shakeſpeare. In reading the preceding ſheets,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0047702300:65"/>
you will have ſeen that, although the violation of Shakeſpeare was the firſt fault for which the Doctor happens to be publickly arraigned, it was by no means the firſt fact in which he had been caught, and for which he would, ſooner or later, have certainly been indicted, by his preſent proſecutor.</p>
            <p>But I ſee how the matter ſtands with you, periodical criticks. Your own credit reſts on too tottering a baſis for you to indulge yourſelves ſafely in any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation you might have to chaſtiſe writers of <hi>eſtabliſhed reputation.</hi> You are therefore reduced, in a manner, to the neceſſity of diſplaying your dexterity in the manual exerciſe of the critical ſcourge, on objects juſt ſtriving to go alone, without any body to ſupport them. This behaviour, doubtleſs, redounds greatly to the honour of your proweſs and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity; and as the notice I here take of it, may poſſibly have ſome little effect on your cenſorial dignity, if not on the intereſt of your proprietor, I ſhall take the liberty of giving both him and you a word of advice, for the regulation of your future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. I muſt own indeed that the Monthly Review, from its regularity in coming to town for ſo many years, full or empty, hath obtained the reputation of being one of the moſt reſpectable ſtage-coaches on the high-road of Parnaſſus; but Mr. G—h, (that is, Mr. <hi>Gee-ho,</hi> the driver) will give me leave to tell him, that, if he continues to detain his paſſengers ſuch a confounded while at Turnham-green, clogging his wheels ſo curſedly with the coom of dullneſs, to make them run ſmooth, ſome other <hi>Jehu,</hi> on the ſame road,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0047702300:66"/>
will infallibly ſet up a poſt-coach with ſteel ſprings, that will beat him hollow. It is, beſides, almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcandalous now to have the beſt place in this carriage; for, look at their horſes; no fewer than ſix of them, you ſee; but how they're matched! black, white, and pye-bald! lame, blind, and ſpavin'd! The very picture of the mock-cavalcade of the Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons! Then you ſee the two fore-horſes drag the whole team! An Hammerſmith ſtage, tugged by a horſe and a half, gets a mile a head of them before they reach Hyde-park-corner. I, myſelf, have even ſometimes rode on the coach-box, when Gee-ho, being a good-natured fellow, would let me hold the reins for half-an-hour or ſo: but I might cry <hi>auy, auy,</hi> till my lungs burſt, before I could mend their pace. It was, indeed, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to me, that we ever got in time to town, when I obſerved that no two horſes ever pulled together, and more than one of them hung an arſe, and drawed back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the way.</p>
            <p>But to drop the allegory.</p>
            <p>You ſpeak of Mr. K's having treated Dr. J. with extraordinary <hi>freedoms.</hi>—Pray, Sir, who is Dr. J. that Mr. K. may not treat him, at his own peril, with as much freedom as he pleaſes? If S. J. be <hi>artium magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> W. K. is <hi>philoſophiae doctor,</hi> and ſo far upon a footing. If S. J. be L. L. D., W. K. is J. U. D. If Mr. K. alſo was not educated at the univerſities that complimented him with his degrees, Dr. J. ſtands in the ſame predicament with regard to thoſe learned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries that dignified him with his. There is, to be ſure, this difference between the two doctors, that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0047702300:67"/>
latter never has thought it worth while, like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to advertiſe ſuch inſignifant circumſtances in the magazines and news-papers, holding in very ſlight eſtimation ſuch literary endowments, as may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a Scotch univerſity for ten pounds; at al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any German one for twenty ducats; and may be had, as Dr. H. knows, from L—th, merely at the moving ſolicitation of a printer.</p>
            <p>Again, you ask, Sir, whether Mr. K. is not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, on account of his ſeverity, of ſharing the fate of Tom Oſborne? That is, in plain terms, of Dr. J's <hi>knocking him down.</hi> This is, to be ſure, a very conciſe and <hi>liberal</hi> method of determining literary merit, and poſſibly may have ſome effect on the Monthly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewers. This intimidating intimation, indeed, may in ſome meaſure ſerve to account for the tremendous influence of Dr. J's perſonal and literary authority in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. For who will heſitate to commend, or dare to contend againſt, a writer poſſeſſed of ſuch <hi>knock-me-down</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Foote's Minor.</note> arguments? You will pleaſe to take this along with you, however, that, although Mr. K. may not have ſuch terrific talents, nor be quite ſo much of a <hi>brute</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See an ingenious copy of verſes, lately publiſhed in the St. James's Chronicle, wherein the Dr. is proved, on the confeſſion of his own friends, to be, indeed, the <hi>Prince of beaſts</hi>; a concluſion at which neither Dr. J. nor his friends could reaſonably take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, one of them having thought proper, in a copy of verſes before printed in the ſame paper, very politely to compare Mr. K. and his friends to a parcel of <hi>moakies</hi>; and, at the ſame time, o liken the ſurly grumbling of the Dr. himſelf to the contemptuous growling of the <hi>

How far Dr. J. may be compared to ſuch an animal ſo diſguiſed, time will ſhew, Mr. K. not having begun to ſtrip off that ſkin, but with a determined reſolution to exhibit the real creature, ſooner or later, in <hi>puris naturalibus.</hi>
               </note> as many more celebrated writers, he may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

            <p>Could you imagine then, Mr. <hi>Monthly,</hi> that Mr. K. would not reſent that partiality which you have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently betrayed in your remarks on <hi>his</hi> Review. This partiality is the more evident from your very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and favourable conſtruction of the ſtile and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a pamphlet recently publiſhed againſt one of the gentlemen attacked by Mr. K. I mean Dr. L—th's Letter to Dr. W—n; the acrimony, ſeverity, and ſcurrility of which are, in every reſpect, much greater than is to be found in the ſtrictures of Mr. K. on Dr. J. And yet this is with you the <hi>elegant</hi> and unexceptionable production of a <hi>gentle</hi> and amiable wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diſplaying equally the abilities of the ſcholar and the gentleman. Nay, you yourſelf, Mr. Critick, have quoted ſome paſſages, wherein the language and alluſions are as <hi>low</hi> as poſſible, and, indeed, hardly grammatical. What do you think of this writer's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing a biſhop of the church, in plain terms, with having been guilty
<q>of <hi>ſneering</hi> at the original Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; with making uſe of far-fetched conceit and forced pleaſantry, void of wit, of meaning, of common ſenſe, and <hi>common decency</hi>: with uſing low banter, illiberal burleſque upon the prophets, the apoſtles, and the holy Scriptures.</q>

pleaſe to obſerve, that ſuch a charge as this, brought againſt ſuch a character, is not only ſcurrilous, but, if falſe, is, to the laſt degree, baſe and injurious. And, pray, how is the truth of ſuch problematic accuſations to be proved? Who is to judge whether the paſſages, hinted at in Dr. W's writings be ſuch <hi>low banter</hi> and <hi>illiberal burleſque</hi> or not? Is Dr. L— himſelf to judge of this, or you, Mr. Monthly Reviewer? Give me leave to ſay, you will find no ſuch <hi>equivocal</hi> accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brought by Mr. K. againſt Dr. J. If he hath charged him with being <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>inattentive,</hi> he hath given repeated proofs of the truth of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If he hath called Dr. J. <hi>indolent, ſelf-ſufficient,</hi> or <hi>arrogant,</hi> is he not notoriouſly all theſe? If Mr. K. hath, at any time, ſuggeſted the Doctor's want of <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> or <hi>invention,</hi> he hath in like manner proved it. After all which, I would be glad to know where is the illiberality or ſcurrility of Mr. K's laughing at him, and calling him <hi>dull</hi>; nay, even though he ſhould inſinuate that he hath no more imagination than a leaden plummet, and ſay he was the <hi>dulleſt animal of all commentators.</hi> For, pray, where is the harm of all this, even whether it be true or falſe? That the Doctor is a commentator, ſuch a one as he is, nobody will deny: that he is an <hi>animal,</hi> and a very ſtrange one too, every body will own: and, as <hi>dullneſs,</hi> even in the higheſt or loweſt degree, is by no means criminal, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how reflections of this kind can be, with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent pretence to impartiality, be deemed illiberal and ſcurrilous by criticks, who have admitted the above inſtance, quoted from Dr. L. to be elegant, refined,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0047702300:72"/>
or polite. It is true that Mr. K. hath ſtrongly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, that Dr. J. hath not done juſtice either to his ſubſcribers, or to the proprietors, in his edition of Shakeſpeare: And hath not he proved it? Nay, doth not the event of its publication ſufficiently ſhew that he had no need to have given himſelf the trouble to prove what all the world admit to be true? If, on this account, he hath treated Dr. J. ſeverely, the Doctor hath juſt the ſame right of complaint as a pickpocket, who gets only horſe whipped, or pumped, inſtead of a ſeverer puniſhment. Ought not the Doctor to do as he does, ſhake his ears, ſlink quietly off, and think himſelf happy <hi>it is no worſe</hi>?</p>
            <p>It is true Mr. K. hath charged Dr. J. with an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious deſign of detracting from the moral and religious character of Shakeſpeare. But in what manner has he done this?—Not by a mere verbally-abuſive declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fact in general; but by a ſpirited and fair allegation, ſupported by particular teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwithſtanding all this, Mr. K. truly, is with you an <hi>Orlando Furioſo</hi> in criticiſm, a very <hi>Mohawk,</hi> a <hi>Cherokee,</hi> and what not <note n="*" place="bottom">Surely this inſtance of the <hi>Monthly</hi> Reviewer's partiality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mr. K. will ſufficiently obviate the fooliſh ſuſpicions of the Candid Reviewers and others, of his being <hi>himſelf</hi> connected with that work. What, becauſe a man may have been accidentally obliged to take up his lodgings in a ſtable, is he to be deemed an horſe, or an oſtler, for ever after? Misfortune may bring a man acquainted, as Trinculo ſays, with ſtrange bed-fellows; but it is his own fault if he does not change his companions with his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</note>.</p>
            <p>A word more, and I have done. You have been pleaſed to expreſs ſome reluctance at ſpreading what
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0047702300:73"/>
you term <hi>perſonalities.</hi> There are many gentlemen alſo, to whoſe judgment Mr. K. is ready to pay the greateſt deference, who expreſs themſelves, on the preſent occaſion, in the ſame ſtrain. Nay, even ſome of Dr. J's friends good-naturedly affect, like the <hi>Monthly</hi> Reviewers, to think Mr. K. hath forgot
<q>the reſpect due to his own rank in the republick of letters,</q>
by deſcending, as they call it, to <hi>ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalities.</hi> But, if they ſay this of the author of the <hi>Review of Dr. J's Shakeſpeare,</hi> what will they ſay of the author of this <hi>Defence</hi> of it?—Doubtleſs, ten times worſe; but I care not.—As to all thoſe, who are juſtly reprehended in this pamphlet, they will of courſe exclaim loudly againſt my having expoſed the petty <hi>particulars</hi> of their pitiful and diſingenuous conduct with regard to Mr. K. and his writings. They will naturally cry it down as <hi>low,</hi> as <hi>il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

It is not for the intereſt of <hi>offenders</hi> that their actions ſhould be too <hi>minutely</hi> ſcrutinized; they muſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly plead for the uſe of <hi>general</hi> reflections only, in order that the accuſation may,
<q>like a wild-gooſe, fly, unclaimed of any man;</q>
but the juſtice due to the individual <hi>perſon</hi> injured, claims a like peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation of <hi>perſonalities.</hi> It were a degradation, indeed, of any man's character to become a common thief-taker or informer; but it can be none for him to ſeize or proſecute thoſe, who may have meanly picked his own pocket, or baſely attempted to aſſaſſinate his friend. It would redound, in like manner, little to the honour of a man of rank or fortune, to ſtoop ſo low as to go to boxing with a Slack or a Broughton;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0047702300:74"/>
but, perhaps, the firſt nobleman in the kingdom would not be diſpleaſed to poſſeſs their athletic abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: in which caſe, I apprehend, the world would think it no impeachment of his dignity, if, highly provoked, he ſhould for once wave his privilege, and chaſtiſe the offender, of what rank ſo ever, at his own weapons. And thus, even ſuppoſing Mr. K's enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic plea of <hi>juſtifying the dead</hi> ſhould, in the more prudential opinion of the <hi>living,</hi> be condemned as chimerical; he hath, at <hi>worſt,</hi> only indulged his <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> at the expence of his <hi>politeneſs,</hi> and waved his pretenſions as "the <hi>ſcholar</hi> and the <hi>gentleman,</hi>" to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> his abilities as a MAN, <hi>gentle</hi> or <hi>ſimple,</hi> as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may determine.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, nothing could be more unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Mr. K. than, through meanneſs or affectation, to ſue for that determination in his favour, which the publick, without knowing it, have, in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, already made. For, however <hi>unneceſſarily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> I may be thought to have been in the foregoing ſheets, the publick are yet to learn the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that confidence, which Mr. K. ſeems, on their ſuffrage, to have aſſumed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reviewer of Dr. Johnſon's Shakeſpeare</hi> indeed, hath too long and too ſucceſsfully laboured in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary vineyard <note n="*" place="bottom">

of literary fame, to which Mr. K. hath at any time made, or hereafter may make, pretenſions, he claims, with proper deference to the publick, not as a <hi>favour,</hi> but as his <hi>due.</hi> He thinks it not leſs diſgraceful to <hi>beg</hi> of the multitude than of an individual; and as he would not willingly <hi>give</hi> undeſerved applauſe to <hi>others,</hi> he ſcorns to <hi>accept</hi> it <hi>himſelf.</hi> His demands are few, and his expectations <hi>moderate</hi>; but, ſuch as they are, he hath ſufficient reaſon to think they will be complied with; for, in ſpite of artifice and cabal <note n="†" place="bottom">Yet to ſo great a height is this ſpirit of caballing carried; that, if a ſpeedy check be not put to it, the pubiick muſt ſoon be content with ſuch entertainment as is catered for them by a junto of opulent printers and bookſellers.
