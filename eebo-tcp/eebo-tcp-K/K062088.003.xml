            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
            <p>AT the end of a week, Celeſtina, with
Mrs. Elphinſtone and her children, were
arrived at the ſmall village of Kirby Thorn,
where, as the youngeſt of the little boys had
appeared the preceding day to droop, his
mother determined to paſs the night. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
who ſaw her friend greatly alarmed
by the indiſpoſition of the child, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to appeaſe her fears by imputing it
to the fatigue and heat of their journey.
But the terrified mother ſaw every moment
new grounds for her apprehenſions, and the
next day the child was evidently much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0206900203:4"/>
worſe. Four and twenty hours more paſſed
in painful ſolicitude, and then Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
knew that it was the meaſles;
and became much eaſier, though the eldeſt
boy had every ſymptom of having taken
the ſame diſorder.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone never left her children
a moment; and Celeſtina, with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
ſolicitude, aſſiſted her. The elder
boy was of a ſanguine and irritable conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and the eruptive fever ran high;
while the ſituation they were in, at a little
inn, where the ſervants and children of the
houſe had not had the diſtemper, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
extremely uncomfortable by the fears
of it's other inhabitants—the murmurs of
the landlady and the reluctance of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, with that cheerful benignity
which was on all occaſions ready for the
ſervice of the diſtreſſed, now acted for her
friend almoſt the part of a ſervant; and in
her frequent viſits to the kitchen for what
was wanted in the ſick room, ſhe ſaw three
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0206900203:5"/>
ſervents, a poſtillion and two footmen, and
obſerved that they ſeemed fixed there, and
were not at preſent travelling. The men
were remarkably well behaved, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the diſcontent of the people of the
inn, had more than once offered to go out
for her on any meſſages ſhe might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſend.</p>
            <p>The mind of Celeſtina was, however, too
much occupied by the little invalids to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
her curioſity to be awakened by this
circumſtance; and ſhe never enquired to
whom theſe ſervants, nor a very plain but
faſhionable poſt chaiſe, about which ſhe ſaw
them ſometimes buſied, belonged. The
children were in the height of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the anxious mother and Celeſtina
entirely occupied about them, when a very
decent perſon, about fifty, who had the
look of a houſekeeper to ſome perſon of
faſhion, came to the door of their room,
which was left open for the ſake of air, and
aſking permiſſion to come in, told them,
that her lady, Lady Horatia Howard, had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0206900203:6"/>
ordered her to wait on them to enquire if
her ſervants or any thing in her power
could contribute to the eaſe of the children,
or the ladies to whom they belonged.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone returned a proper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this very polite and humane meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;
and after the perſon who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it was withdrawn, Celeſtina pauſing
a moment, ſaid that ſhe recollected the
name of Lady Horatia Howard, and that
ſhe was one of the friends moſt eſteemed
among the numerous acquaintance culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by Mrs. Willoughby.</p>
            <p>It was now debated between them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
after ſo obliging a meſſage, Celeſtina
ſhould not make herſelf known to Lady
Horatia: Mrs. Elphinſtone was inclined to
think ſhe ought; but Celeſtina ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſpoſed to avoid it.—"It is true,"
ſaid ſhe, "that I recollect my dear Mrs.
Willoughby to have been very partial to
her, but it is probable that ſhe has long
ſince forgotten me, and that I ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the diſagreeable neceſſity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0206900203:7"/>
myſelf, and recalling to her mind
circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I cannot remember
but with pain. Perhaps, too, ſhe may
know the ſtrange occurrences which have
ſince happened; and though I remember
her converſation to have been very refined
and elegant, perhaps ſhe may expect, if ſhe
honours me with her notice, that I ſhould
prove myſelf worthy of it, by relating all
that has happened; for who knows in
what light the Caſtlenorth's may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
my conduct. I am unequal to all
this, I fear; and unleſs to avail myſelf of
our former acquaintance will be of any uſe
to you, my dear Mrs. Elphinſtone, I ſhall
not, for my own fake only, endeavour to
renew it."</p>
            <p>In a few hours afterwards, however, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Horatia, who had heard from her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the fine form and amiable manners
of the young perſon who was ſo attentive to
the ſick children, contrived to have a door
left open by which ſhe muſt paſs; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, immediately knew her. On her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0206900203:8"/>
return into the room therefore, Lady Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia
ſent her woman again, with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments,
begging to know if the name of
one of the ladies was not De Mornay, and
if it was, requeſting the favour of ſpeaking
to her.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina could not now decline going;
and following the meſſenger, was ſhewn
into a room where Lady Horatia ſat alone.</p>
            <p>"Pardon me, dear Miſs de Mornay,"
cried ſhe, the moment ſhe entered, "if
inſtead of waiting on you, I requeſt to ſee
you here. The truth is, I am fooliſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the ſight of illneſs. That which
has attacked your little friends is not howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I hope, dangerous?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who by the freedom and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this addreſs was immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
from ſome little uneaſineſs which ſhe
had felt from this unexpected interview,
anſwered with all her uſual eaſe and grace,
and Lady Horatia, who ſeemed extremely
pleaſed with having met her, enquired after
Lady Molyneux, and ſuch other of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0206900203:9"/>
former friends, as ſhe thought would renew
no unpleaſing recollections: for though ſhe
did not know all that had happened, ſhe
was well aware how cruel a blow the death
of Mrs. Willoughby had been to Celeſtina,
and had heard ſome confuſed reports that
the marriage of Willoughby and Miſs Fitz-Hayman
was interrupted by his prior at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
to his mother's ward; but ſhe
knew not how far Celeſtina had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the haughty heireſs; and though
ſhe had always a partial kindneſs to her
when ſhe uſed to meet her at Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's,
ſhe had loſt fight of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
afterwards, and, after ſome enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
concluded ſhe was gone back to
France.</p>
            <p>The ſight of her now, at a remote inn
in the North, was as agreeable as it was
unexpected; and though the difference of
their ages ſeemed to preclude any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of intimacy before, for Lady Horatia
was paſſed the middle of life, yet now ſhe
felt herſelf ſtrongly diſpoſed to cultivate a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0206900203:10"/>
pleaſure thus thrown in her way. Celeſtina
could not be inſenſible of the honour ſhe
derived from the notice of a perſon more
eminent for her goodneſs and her talents
than her birth or her fortune, and always
pleaſing, ſhe grew infinitely more ſo where
ſhe deſired to pleaſe. In a few hours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they became ſo happy with each
other, that Lady Horatia could not part
with her but with regret; and Celeſtina
would have left her with reluctance on any
other occaſion than to attend the children
of her friend, (which, during her abſence,
Mrs. Hemmings, Lady Horatia's woman,
had done, with an attention that prevented
Mrs. Elphinſtone's ſuffering from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of Celeſtina with her lady.)</p>
            <p>The children became better and their
mother eaſier. Lady Horatia ſaw and liked
her, and invited both her and Celeſtina to
give her as much of their time as they
could ſpare from their little convaleſcents.
In conſequence of this invitation they were
now a good deal with her, and Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0206900203:11"/>
on ſome occaſion expreſſing how
fortunate ſhe thought herſelf that in ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a place ſhe had the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
known to her, Lady Horatia ſaid,
ſmiling,—"And I dare ſay you think it
very extraordinary too, my dear Madam;
for unleſs you had known me before it
would be difficult to account for my being
here. Did you never remark that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
makes people reſtleſs?"</p>
            <p>"Oh, yes! very often," replied Mrs.
Elphinſtone with a ſigh.</p>
            <p>"It has had that effect on me," ſaid
Lady Horatia; and ſatiated with every
thing in what is called the world, where I
have paſſed the greater part of my life, I
often leave it and ramble about, careleſs
of every thing but change of place; my
old faithful ſervants and a few books being
the ſole companions of my travels. I have
for theſe laſt four or five years given up
my houſe in the country, and paſſed all
the ſummer in wandering about Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France, and England. This year
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0206900203:12"/>
I am going into Scotland, for no other
reaſon than becauſe I have not been there
before: at this village one of my horſes
fell lame; and as it was indifferent to me
where I was, I agreed to my ſervant's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of ſtaying here a day or two. While
I waited, you arrived here, and I own very
ſincerely that I became intereſted for the
children and for the ladies, ſuch as Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
deſcribed them to me. I hope we
ſhall none, of us be ſorry for the accidents
that detained us here, when the little boys
are quite well, as I am perſuaded they will
be now in a few days. They will have
paſſed happily through a very troubleſome
diſtemper, and I think you will each of
you have added a friend to your ſtock:
the advantage, however, will be ſtill more
evidently mine, for I hope to have added
two."</p>
            <p>A few days confirmed the good opinion
which Lady Horatia entertained of her
new acquaintance and her acquaintance of
her. If ſhe was particularly attached to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0206900203:13"/>
Celeſtina, it was becauſe ſhe was young
enough to be her daughter, and becauſe
ſhe told her that ſhe could not look at her,
eſpecially when ſhe was reading or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in any thing that gave a ſerious caſt
to her features, without remarking her
likeneſs to a perſon ſhe had once fondly
loved.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, whoſe thoughts were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fixed on the ſtrange myſtery which
hung over her birth, and who caught at
every thing likely to clear it up, bluſhed
deeply the firſt time ſhe made this remark,
and aſked whether this perſon was a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner?</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia ſighed in her turn, and
ſaid, no! it was a brother of hers, who
had not been long dead. "He was a
ſoldier," ſaid ſhe, "and loſt his life in
America, in that war which tore it from the
Britiſh empire. Judge yourſelf of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
though I well know it muſt be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0206900203:14"/>
She then took out of a travelling trunk a
little filligreed caſket, in which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
valuable trinkets and ſeveral pictures.
Three were the portraits of gentlemen.—"Come,"
ſaid Lady Horatia, "to prove
whether this reſemblance is merely a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera
of mine, let us aſk Mrs. Elphinſtone
if among theſe pictures ſhe ſees one which
is like any body ſhe knows; for my dear
Miſs de Mornay, do you know this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of countenance ſtruck me when you
were a child with Mrs. Willoughby; and
now that your features are more formed, it
is, in my mind, wonderfully ſtrong. But,
my ſweet friend, why do you appear ſo
uneaſy?"</p>
            <p>"I cannot very well tell," replied Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
trying to force a ſmile: "I am ſure
to bear a reſemblance to any body dear to
your Ladyſhip muſt be ever pleaſing to
me, though I well know that it muſt be,
as you obſerve, quite accidental."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone then coming in, Lady
Horatia ſhewed her the three portraits:—
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0206900203:15"/>
"Come tell us, Mrs. Elphinſtone, if you
know any living friend whom either of theſe
portraits reſembles?"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone took them, and looked
ſteadily a moment on each; then fixing on
one, ſhe looked more intently, firſt on
that and then on Celeſtina. "Indeed I
think I do," cried ſhe: "I ſurely ſee a
reſemblance—a very ſtrong reſemblance,
between this picture and Miſs de Mornay.
Bleſs me, how very like! the ſhape of the
face, the mouth, the dark-brown eyebrow,
the colour of the eyes, the ſetting on of the
hair round the forehead and temples; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that it is leſs fair, that the features are
proportionably larger, and that you wear
a cap, in truth, my dear friend, it might
have been drawn for you."</p>
            <p>"And yet," ſaid Lady Horatia, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mournfully, "this was drawn for a
brother of mine, who could, I fear, be no
relation to our lovely friend here: ſo
ſtrangely it happens that features coincide."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0206900203:16"/>
"It is fortunate, very fortunate for me,
Madam," ſaid Celeſtina gravely, "if this
reſemblance has had the effect of prejudic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Ladyſhip in my favour."</p>
            <p>"You have merit enough to juſtify it,
though I had conceived an affection for
you without any introduction. But we will
talk no more of reſemblances, if ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
makes us melancholy."</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia then turned the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the next day, as the two little
boys were by this time well enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
their journey, they moved on about
twenty miles together; Lady Horatia beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
for that day to have Celeſtina with
her, while her woman went with Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone,
to aſſiſt in the care of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who knew only in general
that Lady Horatia was a widow of very
affluent fortune, who gave up much of
her time to literary purſuits and literary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections,
and much of her fortune to the
aſſiſtance of the unhappy, now learned
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0206900203:17"/>
that domeſtic misfortunes had contributed,
with her natural turn of mind, to eſtrange
her entirely from thoſe ſcenes where Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
had ſometimes formerly ſeen her; and
that having loſt an only daughter, (the laſt
of her children,) of a deep decline, ſhe now
tried to call off her mind from the ſubjects
of her mournful contemplations by change
of place, and had never, ſince that period,
reſided long at any of her own houſes, but
had paſſed almoſt the whole year in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling;
ſtopping wherever ſhe found a
pleaſant ſpot, and often remaining ſeveral
days, or even weeks, at ſome remote houſe.
She had once or twice, ſhe ſaid, engaged
friends to go with her on theſe expeditions,
but had always found the difficulties they
made ſo much counterbalance the pleaſure
they were capable of affording her, that
ſhe now travelled alone. "Some," ſaid
ſhe, "were tired, and ſome were taſteleſs;
ſome were talkative and ſome were inſipid.
You will certainly think me faſtidious;
and perhaps I am ſo; but indeed it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0206900203:18"/>
more difficult to find ſuch a companion as
ſuits me in every reſpect, than appears at
firſt view. Women of my own age, who
are eſtabliſhed in the world, cannot of
courſe leave their families and connections;
thoſe who are not, are for the moſt part
unhappy from pecuniary or family diſtreſſes,
and the mind, depreſſed at that period of
life, has loſt it's power of reſiſtance, and
ſinks in that hopeleſs languor from which
I often want to be myſelf relieved by cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
converſation. The young do not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
for proſpects, or enjoy cataracts and
mountains: they are looking out for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and are wearied when there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men to talk to or adventures to be
hoped for. I have tried two or three young
ladies; and found, that as we had no ideas
in common, our converſation was ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted;
and when I  was near any place
of ſummer reſort, or paſſed through a town
at the time of a race or a muſic meeting,
their hearts were beating to enter into ſcenes
which I was only ſolicitous to fly from.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0206900203:19"/>
Do you know, however, that if I had not
met you abſolutely engaged on this Scottiſh
journey, I ſhould have been ſtrongly
tempted to enquire whether you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me to make the experiment once more,
where I am ſtrongly impreſſed with an idea
that I ſhould meet with better ſucceſs."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina anſwered, that her good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
did her the utmoſt honour: and by
degrees the tender and maternal ſolicitude
Lady Horatia expreſſed for her, drew from
her the little narrative of her life. Lady
Horatia expreſſed the greateſt averſion to
Lady Caſtlenorth. "It is true," ſaid ſhe,
"I do hot know her much from my own
obſervation; for ſhe is a woman whoſe,
converſation I have always diſliked and
avoided; but from ſome anecdotes of her
that have been related to me by thoſe who
know her well, I believe it may with truth
be ſaid of her, as was ſaid of a celebrated
political character, that ſhe has "a heart
to imagine, a head to contrive, and a hand
to execute any miſchief." Willoughby
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0206900203:20"/>
is young, open-hearted, and artleſs: by no
means likely to ſuſpect, or likely to detect
artifice ſo deep as what ſhe is capable of;
and I am well convinced that there are no
contrivances at which ſhe would heſitate,
either to carry a favourite point or avenge
it's failure."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina was extremely comforted by
this opinion given by ſo good a judge.
Every other ſorrow was comparatively light
to that which ſhe felt from the idea, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it forced itſelf upon her mind, that
Willoughby had, through ambition, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price,
or avarice, voluntarily deſerted her;
and every opinion that ſtrengthened her
own hopes of his unaltered affection, and
imputed his leaving her to the evil machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the Caſtlenorths, was ſoothing
and conſolatory.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia Howard was now travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
towards Edinburgh, and made the
time of Mrs. Elphinſtone her own, for
the pleaſure ſhe derived from her company,
and ſtill more from that of Celeſtina, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0206900203:21"/>
whom, during this journey, ſhe became ſo
much attached, that ſhe made her promiſe
to come to her whenever the abode ſhe was
now going to ſhould be inconvenient, or
whenever ſhe was under the neceſſity of
changing it. An invitation ſo flattering
was gratefully accepted; and Lady Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia
having ſhewn both her travelling
friends every polite and generous attention,
took leave of them with regret on their
leaving Edinburgh with Elphinſtone, who
was there waiting for them. She gave Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
directions whither to write to her for
the remainder of the ſummer, and again
made her promiſe to come to her in the
winter, if ſhe left her Scottiſh friends; and
at all events to contrive to paſs with her
two or three months of the next ſummer.
After taking leave of her, a very tedious
and very dreary journey of many days
brought the Elphinſtone's and Celeſtina to
the ſea ſide, where they were to embark for
the Iſle of Skie. Mrs. Elphinſtone, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to ſee ſo many different countries,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0206900203:22"/>
was yet ſtruck with diſmay at the ſight of
the black and dreary heaths over which
they travelled; and in ſpite of all her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to ſuſtain her courage, ſhe looked
at her children with eyes where maternal
anguiſh was too viſibly expreſſed. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
however, to whom novelty had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
charms, was not yet weary of his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and he was as gay and unconcerned
as if he had been leading his wife to the
moſt beautiful eſtate in England. Celeſtina,
though very little delighted with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
they had paſſed through, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to teſtify no diſlike to it that might
add to the painful dejection of her friend,
and by making light of the inconveniencies
of the journey, and putting their hopes and
proſpects in the faireſt light, ſhe ſupported
her drooping ſpirits, which the thoughtleſs
and ſomewhat unfeeling vivacity of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
himſelf, ſerved rather to depreſs
than to ſupport.</p>

            <p>ARRIVED at their inſular abode after
great fatigue, Mrs. Elphinſtone, recalling
all her fortitude, buſied herſelf in making
it as comfortable as ſhe could; and aſſumed,
at leaſt, the appearance of cheerfulneſs,
though Celeſtina ſaw with concern that it
was often <hi>but</hi> appearance. Celeſtina her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
however, whoſe mind had too long
been unpleaſingly called off from that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
on which ſhe beſt loved to fix it, was
far from being diſpleaſed by the perfect
ſecluſion of the place. She could now
wander whole days alone, amid the wild
ſolitude in which ſhe found herſelf, liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only to the ruſh of the cataract, which,
daſhing through broken ſtones, ſparkled
amid the dark heath on either ſide of it;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0206900203:24"/>
or the ſullen waves of the ocean itſelf,
which on all ſides, ſurrounded her. The
ptarmigan,<note n="*" place="bottom">A bird of the grous kind, common in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Scotland.</note> burſting from it's heathy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
or the ſea fowl ſcreeming from the
rocks, were the only ſounds that broke
theſe murmurs; but ſhe found her ſpirits
ſoothed by the wildneſs of the places ſhe
viſited; and far from regretting the more
cultivated ſcenes ſhe had left, ſhe rejoiced
that ſince ſhe no longer could hope to ſee
Willoughby, ſhe was releaſed from the
neceſſity of attending to any other perſon.</p>
            <p>The immenſe diſtance that was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, ſhe ſometimes conſidered with
diſmay; but at others ſhe remembered—
<q>That diſtance only, cannot change the heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She truſted on the long tried, the long
aſſured tenderneſs of her lover, and was
willing to indulge the ſoothing hope that
they ſhould meet again to be ſeparated no
more, and that he was labouring to remove
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0206900203:25"/>
the fatal obſtacle, whatever it was, that
now divided them.</p>
            <p>After having been above five weeks on
the iſland, a large pacquet arrived from
Cathcart. It encloſed, among many to
his ſiſter, one to Celeſtina from Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
and this, more than any ſhe had yet
received from him ſince his abſence, ſeemed
to aſſure her of his unfailing attachment.
It was leſs confuſed than thoſe he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
written, and ſeemed the production
of a mind more maſter of itſelf: and,
though it did not ſpeak in poſitive terms
of his immediate return, Celeſtina fancied
that many of the expreſſions alluded to
that hour; and her heart found this idea
ſo deliciouſly ſoothing, that ſhe would not
ſuffer her reaſon to deprive her of any part
of the pleaſure ſhe found in indulging it.</p>
            <p>A few of the reſidents of this and the
neighbouring iſlands were by this time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
at the houſe of Mr. Elphinſtone.
The young, (and of young people their
viſitors principally conſiſted,) were all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0206900203:26"/>
charmed with Celeſtina, who, whatever
was her inclination for ſolitude, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to make one in the ramble of the
morning, or to join the cheerful dance of
an evening. Elphinſtone, naturally good
humoured, and particularly deſirous of
pleaſing her, ſoon became anxious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
theſe parties, which Celeſtina, whoſe
heart was opened to new ſenſations of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſince the receipt of Willoughby's laſt
letter, did not decline; not only becauſe
ſhe found much in theſe remote regions to
gratify her curioſity, but becauſe ſhe foreſaw
that, from the ſhortneſs.of the ſummer ſo
far North, the days when theſe amuſements
were practicable were drawing to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
and that ſhe ſoon ſhould be left
unmoleſted, to liſten to the roaring of the
waters, and the ſighings of the wind round
the naked rocks, againſt which it inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
beat.</p>
            <p>It was now the end of July, and Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
had already viſited Jona and ſeveral
other iſlands. Sometimes theſe excurſions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0206900203:27"/>
had been made with Mrs. Elphinſtone,
but oftener without her. Elphinſtone kept
a boat, which was always ready for the
ſervice of Celeſtina, and when his wife
could not go with her, a Miſs Macqueen,
a very agreeable young highland lady, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
made the third.</p>
            <p>Several little iſles, which afford no habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
for winter, are ſcattered among the
larger iſlands, which are called the Hebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
One of theſe lay within ſight of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone's
houſe, (which was cloſe to the
ſhore,) at the diſtance of about a mile and
a half. It was remarkable for the groteſque
form of the cliffs which aroſe round it, and
for a ſtream of the pureſt water, that bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
up at the higheſt ground, and fell
into the ſea through a chaſm of the rock.
Celeſtina, to whom Elphinſtone had ſhewn
it, laughingly called it her iſland; and he,
in return, had ſaid that were ſhe eſtabliſhed
on it, it would become more dangerous
than the iſland of Calypſo. Among other
little plans of amuſement, which the decline
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0206900203:28"/>
of ſummer inſenſibly rendered more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
it was agreed that on the firſt fine
day ſome cold proviſions ſhould be taken,
and that they would all dine together on
one of the natural ſtone tables in Celeſtina's
iſland.</p>
            <p>A fine day was found; the party, which
were Mr. and Mrs. Elphinſtone, Miſs
Macqueen, and two gentlemen, were
ready, when one of the boatmen who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accompanied them was no where to
be found. Elphinſtone, equally impatient
and eager, whatever was the importance or
inſignificance of the matter he was engaged
in, was going himſelf in ſearch of the miſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man, when one of thoſe who remained
in the boat followed and told him that
there was a young man a few yards farther
on the ſhore, who would take the place of
him that was abſent, and that it was better
not to wait: Elphinſtone, ſatisfied ſo long
as his party was not interrupted, accepted
the offer, and the boatman beckoning to a
highlander who ſtood at ſome diſtance, he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0206900203:29"/>
ran towards them and was admitted into
the boat.</p>
            <p>The party now put off from ſhore. The
water was beautifully ſmooth, the ſky
clear, and the wind in their favour; very
little exertion therefore on the part of the
men who were entruſted with the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
landed them ſafely on the ilk. It
did not contain more than three acres of
land, and the ſole inhabitant of it was a
ſolitary herdſman, whoſe temporary dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
compoſed of looſe ſtones, turf, and
heath, he had raiſed under the protection
of a large cliff of grey ſlate, that ſeemed
to have ſtarted away, in ſome ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
of nature, from ſome other iſland,
and to have fixed itſelf as a ſea mark
amidſt the perpendicular and abrupt rocks
that fenced this on every ſide. The ſpring
burſt out near it's baſe, and here the party
ſat down to make their gay repaſt.</p>
            <p>When it was over, the gentlemen went
away; and while the boatmen were at
dinner, puſhed out the boat themſelves
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0206900203:30"/>
and began to fiſh near the ſhore, while
Celeſtina, leaving the ladies together,
walked away alone to the weſtern coaſt of
the iſland.</p>
            <p>The ſun was already declining in an
almoſt cloudleſs ſky, and gave the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſplendour to the broad expanſe of
ocean, broken by ſeveral iſlands, whoſe
rocky points and angular cliffs caught the
ſtrong lights, in brilliant contraſt to the
lucid hue of the heath with which their
ſummits were cloathed, and which on the
northern and eaſtern ſides threw a dark
ſhadow on the clear and tranquil boſom
of the ſea. The ſea birds, in ſwarming
myriads, were returning to their neſts
among the ragged precipices beneath her;
and Celeſtina, recalling to her mind the
"green delights" of Alveſtone,
<q>It's deepening woods, gay lawns, and airy ſummits,</q>
compared it, in penſive contemplation,
with the ſcene before her; yet different as
they were, ſhe thought that with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0206900203:31"/>
any place would be to her a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;
and that even in ſuch a remote ſpot
as this ſhe ſhould be happy if it gave only
a ſubſiſtence with him.</p>
            <p>This train of thought a little indulged,
made her have recourſe to her pencil, and
produced an addreſs to him in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <head>SONNET.</head>
                  <l>On this lone iſland, whoſe unfruitful breaſt</l>
                  <l>Feeds but the ſummer-ſhepherds little flock,</l>
                  <l>With ſcanty herbage from the half cloath'd rock,</l>
                  <l>Where oſprays, cormorants, and ſea mews reſt;</l>
                  <l>Even in a ſcene ſo deſolate and rude</l>
                  <l>I could with <hi>thee</hi> for months and years be bleſt;</l>
                  <l>And, of thy tenderneſs and love poſſeſt,</l>
                  <l>Find all <hi>my</hi> world in this lone ſolitude!</l>
                  <l>When the bright ſun theſe northern ſeas illume,</l>
                  <l>With thee admire the lights reflected charms;</l>
                  <l>And when drear Winter ſpreads his cheerleſs gloom,</l>
                  <l>Still find Elyſium in thy ſheltering arms;</l>
                  <l>For thou to me canſt ſovereign bliſs impart,</l>
                  <l>Thy mind my empire, and my throne thy heart.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0206900203:32"/>
The broad orb of the ſun was now only
half ſeen above the horizon; and Celeſtina,
who had little marked the progreſs of
time, roſe, and haſtened to join her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
as ſhe turned for this purpoſe
towards that part of the iſland where ſhe
had left them, ſhe ſaw the highlander,
who had been taken by chance into the
boat in conſequence of the abſence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtart up from the ground at about
two hundred paces from her, where he
ſeemed to have been concealed behind a
cairn or pile of rude ſtones, and hurry
away towards the part of the ſhore where
the boat had been left. The incident
however made no great impreſſion on her
mind, but from the ſingular appearance
of the man, who was in a complete high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
dreſs, which is now not often ſeen,
and which made him, as he walked very
quickly on before her, ſeem exactly the
figure a painter would have choſen to have
placed in a landſcape, repreſenting the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0206900203:33"/>
heathy ſummits and romantic rocks of the
Hebrides.</p>
            <p>She ſoon rejoined Mrs. Elphinſtone and
Miſs Macqueen. The three gentlemen
almoſt as ſoon approached to tell them it
was time to return; and they arrived again
at their home after a little excurſion with
which all ſeemed pleaſed, though Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
had ſuffered ſome raillery for having
ſo long deſerted them.</p>
            <p>Every day now paſſed nearly alike, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
only now and then by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of a ſtranger from ſome of the other
iſlands, and ſometimes a party in the boat.
Elphinſtone was not yet tired by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
which brought him hither, for to uſe
an expreſſion of his wife's, which ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with a melancholy ſmile to Celeſtina,
"the new was not yet off." He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
gay and alert; perſuaded himſelf, by
calculations, which he made after his own
ſanguine manner, that he was not only a
benefactor to the public, but ſhould in a
few years realize a great fortune by facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0206900203:34"/>
the capture of herrings among the
weſtern iſlands of Scotland.</p>
            <p>The ſeaſon for the proof of his exploits
in this way was now rapidly approaching,
and he became every day more buſy: but
his wife looked forward to it with leſs
pleaſure: ſhe languiſhed for her little
girls, who were at the other extremity of
England, and thought with diſmay of the
tempeſts of winter, which would ſhut her
out from the little communication ſhe yet
had with that country. But whatever was
her regret, ſhe ſuffered it not to diſturb
the tranſient happineſs her huſband ſeemed
to enjoy, nor to communicate any gloom
to the milder cheerfulneſs of Celeſtina,
whoſe company was her greateſt reſource
againſt that cold deſpondence, which, in
deſpite of all her fortitude, ſometimes
ſeized on her heart.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had now been almoſt three
months an inhabitant of the Iſle of Skie,
and felt nothing unpleaſant in her inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſituation but the length of time that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0206900203:35"/>
muſt always elapſe before ſhe could hear
from Willoughby or even from Cathcart.
A ſecond packet was however brought to
Mrs. Elphinſtone from the latter before the
expiration of the eleventh week of their
abode. With eager impatience it was
opened. Celeſtina received her part of it
with a beating heart; but on unſealing it
found no letter from Willoughby. A
letter, in a hand which ſhe did not at the
moment recollect ever to have ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
attracted her attention and mingled
it with ſomething of terror. She looked
eagerly at the name, and ſaw it ſigned
with that of the elder Mr. Thorold. Her
ſpirits ſunk! was it ſome ill news of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
which he communicated that he
might ſoften the blow? She hurried it
over in ſuch breathleſs agitation as hardly
gave her leave to underſtand what ſhe read,
which was to this effect:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>Your old friend, amiable Celeſtina,
though he has only had one letter from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0206900203:36"/>
you ſince you left him, reminds you
of himſelf once more, and is ſorry that,
like every thing in this world, his letter
will convey to you a mixture of pleaſure
and pain.</p>
                  <p>My daughter Arabella is married, to
her own wiſhes and thoſe of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In point of fortune ſhe has done
well. We cannot here obtain every
thing. I hope ſhe will be happy, and
am ſure ſhe will be rich, which, in the
opinion of moſt fathers, you know, puts
the former point out of doubt. You
will gueſs that Mr. Bettenſon is the
gentleman who is now numbered with
my family. My wife has been gone
with the new married couple ſome
weeks to the ſeat of Mr. Bettenſon's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Norfolk.</p>
                  <p>You know I love home; and I love
that thoſe who are leſs delighted with
it ſhould not be needleſsly diſturbed
when they are out; for which reaſon I
have never communicated to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0206900203:37"/>
that Montague, after attending
his ſiſter's wedding here, did not return
to Oxford as he talked of doing; that
I know not whither he is gone, and
have only had one letter from him ſince,
in which he aſſures me he is well, and
deſires I would not be uneaſy about him.</p>
                  <p>It is very difficult to be otherwiſe.
This eccentric young man makes me
tremble for him perpetually. Having
no clue to direct my gueſſes, I have no
conjecture where or with whom he is;
and think it better to ſay as little as I
can about an abſence on which a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
unfavourable conſtructions may be
put. Ah! my lovely ward, how fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
it would have been, if, when his
judgment directed his heart, it could
have been accepted where—but this is
wrong, or at beſt uſeleſs. Farewel!
May heaven protect you! and I pray
you not to forget</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>your moſt faithful friend, E. THOROLD.</signed>

Relieved from her firſt apprehenſions,
Celeſtina felt extremely concerned at the
abſence of Montague Thorold; ſo painful
to his father, perhaps ſo diſcreditable to
himſelf. She read over the letter again,
and fancied it very evident that Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
imputed it to ſome new attachment;
and giving a ſigh to the recollection of all
it muſt coſt ſuch a father to ſee ſuch an
unfortunate turn of mind blaſt all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements
of learning, and all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of genius, ſhe turned her thoughts
to Willoughby, and felt with renewed
poignancy the diſappointment of not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heard from him.</p>
            <p>Another and another week paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intelligence, and all the ſoothing
hopes Celeſtina had ſo fondly encouraged
gradually gave way to fear and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
At length a ſecond packet arrived:
it contained a letter indeed from Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby;
but ſo far was it from confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the favourable preſages of the former,
that ſhe ſaw in it only a prelude to the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0206900203:39"/>
event which other information made her
believe would ſoon happen—the marriage
of Willoughby and Miſs Fitz-Hayman.
Lady Horatia Howard, whoſe-attachment
to Celeſtina had taken very deep root,
had written to her from London, whither
ſhe was now gone, and had told her, with
as much tenderneſs as ſhe could, that ſuch
was the general report among the relations
of the family, and what was generally be
lieved in the world. From the ſame
channel ſhe alſo learned that Sir Philip
and Lady Molyneux were expected in
England early in the enſuing winter, and
that a large houſe in Portman-ſquare was
fitting up in the moſt ſplendid ſtile for their
reception.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia concluded a moſt friendly
letter to Celeſtina thus:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>But my dear Miſs De Mornay, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
all theſe things may be, let me
hope that you will not hide yourſelf in
the Hebrides all the winter: why ſhould
you? Talents and virtues like your's
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0206900203:40"/>
were never intended for obſcurity.
Come then to me, and aſſure yourſelf
of the trueſt welcome. You need not
apprehend meeting Mr. Willoughby
and his bride, for it is underſtood that
they are to remain ſome time abroad;
and before they return to England,
you will have learned to conquer thoſe
painful emotions which the ſight of
them now perhaps might give you.
<hi>Your</hi> underſtanding ſets you above the
puerile indulgence which inferior minds
claim by preſcription towards a firſt
love. The man whom any common
conſideration could induce, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
won your affections, to deſert you,
never could deſerve you; and if ſome
inſurmountable barrier is between you,
you will learn to conſider him as a
friend, and conſult his peace in regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that cheerfulneſs which he meant
not to deſtroy; but which to ſee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
muſt overcloud his days, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
proſperous they may otherwiſe be.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0206900203:41"/>
There was in this letter more meant
than was expreſſed; and on conſidering
it, the wonder and uneaſineſs of Celeſtina
were redoubled. But however obliged ſhe
thought herſelf by the friendly intereſt
Lady Horatia took in her happineſs, and
however juſt her arguments might be, ſhe
felt no inclination to quit her preſent ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
and ſince ſhe had now leſs hope
than ever of meeting Willoughby, ſhe
had leſs than ever a deſire to return into
the world, but gave herſelf up to that
melancholy deſpondence, againſt which
hope, and her own ſanguine and cheerful
temper, had till now ſupported her.</p>
            <p>To indulge this encreaſing ſadneſs, it
was now her cuſtom to walk out alone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dinner, and to make for herſelf a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of gloomy enjoyment from the dreary
and wild ſcenes around her. A little time
before, ſhe had been imagining how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
the moſt deſolate of theſe barren iſlands
might be rendered to her by the preſence
of her beloved Willoughby. She now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0206900203:42"/>
ſought images of horror. The ſun,
far diſtant from this northern region, was
as faint and languid as the ſick thoughts
of Celeſtina: his feeble rays no longer
gave any warm colouring to the rugged
cliffs that roſe above her head, or lent the
undulating ſea that ſparkling brilliance
which a few weeks before had given gaiety
and cheerfulneſs even to theſe ſcattered
maſſes of almoſt naked ſtone, againſt which
the water inceſſantly broke. Grey, ſullen,
and cold, the waves now ſlowly rolled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſhore, where Celeſtina fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſat whole hours, as if to count
them, when ſhe had in reality no idea pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to her but Willoughby loſt to her for
ever—Willoughby forgetting her, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Miſs Fitz-Hayman!</p>
            <p>She had more than once remarked, in
returning from her walks, that a man,
who kept always at ſuch a diſtance that
ſhe could merely diſcover to be a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
ſeemed to be obſerving her; yet
as he never came near her, and always
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0206900203:43"/>
diſappeared before ſhe got near the houſe,
ſhe could not imagine him to be one of
the people belonging to Elphinſtone: but
puzzled rather than alarmed by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
for which ſhe could not account,
ſhe inſenſibly ceaſed to notice him. Mrs.
Elphinſtone, occupied as ſhe was by her
own domeſtic uneaſineſs, was ſtill moſt
tenderly attentive to Celeſtina, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to communicate to her ſome of that
ſtill and mournful acquieſcence which
ſerved her in place of philoſophy. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
had not yet ſuffered enough to learn
it; but ſhe forbore to add to the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
of her friend by indulging her own
while they were together; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
threw her more than ever into entire
ſolitude, though the autumn was ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
that the weather frequently drove
her from the open hill, or the vale under
it, to the caſual ſhelter of ſome natural
cave, by the ſide of which, the torrent, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by the ſtorm, hoarſely ruſhed, and
was anſwered by the roar of other ſtreams,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0206900203:44"/>
whoſe hollow murmurs ſwelled in the guſts
of wind that whiſtled through the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
tracks, and compelled even the
fowls of the deſart to ſeek ſhelter, where
only it was afforded, within the caverns
of the cliffs, or among the matted heath
that cloathed their ſummits.</p>
            <p>The delicate, the elegant, the lovely
Celeſtina, ſhe whoſe talents would have
adorned the moſt informed ſociety, and
whoſe beauty might have given new luſtre
to the faireſt aſſembly, was thus a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baniſhed
recluſe in the remoteſt and moſt
uncultivated part of the Britiſh dominions.
Her wiſh now was, to paſs her whole life
here, in that ſullen calm which ſhe at length
hoped to obtain; and the rudeſt ſcene of
theſe iſlands now appeared to her infinitely
preferable to any of the pleaſures Lady
Horatia Howard offered her, ſince <hi>they</hi>
could only ſerve to remind her of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby;
perhaps to ſhew her how happy
he could learn to be, united with another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0206900203:45"/>
The frequency of ſtorms now prevented
many of thoſe viſits which had, during
ſummer, a little broken, for Elphinſtone,
the uniformity of ſolitude; but it was the
height of the ſeaſon for catching herrings,
and he was buſy, and for the preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
while his unfortunate wife, who, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
as her preſent ſituation was, yet
dreaded the hour when this buſtle ſhould
ſink into diſcontent and give place to other
projects, received him on his return from
thoſe expeditions to other iſlands, in which
he was now frequently engaged, always
with cheerfulneſs, which he did not, or
would not ſee, was forced; and ſometimes
with ſmiles, which to every body but him
very evidently were the ſmiles of ſtifled an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina anſwered Lady Horatia's letter
as it deſerved, but to Willoughby ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not to write. That trembling
ſolicitude with which ſhe had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
to expect letters from him, it was
now, ſhe thought, time to ſubdue, for ſhe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0206900203:46"/>
perſuaded herſelf that never again they
would bring to her any thing but anguiſh
and regret: and yet by thoſe contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſations to which violent attachments
ſubject the human heart, ſhe inceſſantly
indulged herſelf in thinking of all thoſe
happy hours which ſhe had paſſed with
him, whom ſhe fancied deſerved little or
no regret, of whom ſhe ought not to think
at all, and yet was ſo fond of recollecting,
that every converſation was irkſome to
her, and every employment a taſk, which
took off her attention a moment from him.</p>
            <q>Ti perdo! ti laſcio, non ti vedro piu—</q>
            <p>ſhe repeated inceſſantly to herſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with tears of tenderneſs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with thoſe painful emotions of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
anger and regret which preſs on the
heart when pride and reſentment are ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
with affection. In other moods ſhe
reproached herſelf for thus cheriſhing this
unhappy paſſion, tried to recal thoſe days
of reſignation when, without hope of ever
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0206900203:47"/>
being his, ſhe yet preferred Willoughby to
all mankind; and to diſmiſs from her mind
for ever the recollection of the few weeks
when he had awakened that hope, and
called forth all her ſenſibility only as it
ſhould ſeem to render her wretched; then
ſhe exclaimed in her native language—
<q>
                  <l>Felicité paſſée</l>
                  <l>Qui ne peut revenir</l>
                  <l>Tourment de ma penſée</l>
                  <l>Que n'ai je en te perdant, perdu le ſouvenir.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe gloomy moods, ſhe was quite
unable to remain a moment in company,
eſpecially in the company of Elphinſtone,
who, with the true projecter's infatuation,
fancied every body elſe as much intereſted
about the fiſhery as he was; and perſecuted
her with details of how many <hi>buſſes</hi> he had
out and how many <hi>laſts</hi> they had taken;
what was the beſt method of curing them,
and of the ſuperiority which a few years
would give the fiſhery in which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
over the Dutch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0206900203:48"/>
Celeſtina began to dread the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and had it not been for Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone,
of whoſe ſuffering merit ſhe
was every hour more ſenſible, ſhe would
not have forborne to expreſs her wearineſs
and diſguſt. A hearer was neceſſary to
Elphinſtone; and when he had' nobody
elſe to talk to, this unenviable place was
filled by the inwardly-impatient Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>It happened, however, that ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
from this for ſome days. Towards
the end of November, Elphinſtone went
to the Iſle of Harries, on his buſineſs, as
he fancied, and the wind being againſt his
return, ſhe no longer liſtened. to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of curing herrings, but returned to
her ſhortened but leſs interrupted walks.
In one of theſe, towards the cloſe of a very
lowering and cheerleſs day, when her way
was along the rugged cliffs that, on the
weſtern ſide of the iſland, hung over the
ſea, ſhe compoſed the following ſonnet:</p>

            <p>ELPHINSTONE had now been
abſent ſome days, and the wind, which
was contrary and violent, prevented his
return to the place of his abode. Mrs.
Elphinſtone became uneaſy at the ſtorms
which detained him, and Celeſtina parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated
in her anxiety. At length the
wind ſunk, and, towards the evening of
the fifth day of his abſence, was fair to
bring him from Herries. Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
who had been a good deal alarmed
by the hurricanes of ſeveral preceding
days, and had wearied her ſpirits by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weather and. keeping an anxious
eye towards the impracticable ſea, found
herſelf indiſpoſed and ſhivering; and
telling Celeſtina that ſhe believed ſhe had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0206900203:51"/>
caught cold, ſhe went early to bed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking,
as ſhe bade her good night, that
Elphinſtone would probably be at home
in the morning.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, left alone, went out as was
her cuſtom, even although the evening
was already cloſed in; and ſtanding on
the edge of the rocks, near the houſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
the ſingular appearance of the
moon, which was now riſing. It was
large, and of a dull red, ſurrounded by
clouds of a deep purple, whoſe ſkirts
ſeemed touched with flame. Large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of heavy vapour were gathering in
the ſky, and the heaving ſurges ſwelled
towards the ſhore, and broke upon it with
that ſullen regularity that foretels a ſtorm.
From the North, aroſe diſtinctly the pointed
rays of the Aurora Borealis: fiery and
portentous, they ſeemed to flaſh like faint
lightning a little while, till the moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
clearer, rendered them leſs viſible.</p>
            <p>Not a ſound was heard but the dull
murmurs of the ſea on one ſide and the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0206900203:52"/>
rapid waterfalls on the other, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
noiſe foretold with equal certainty
an approaching tempeſt. Celeſtina, who
was in that diſpoſition of mind to which
horrors are congenial, walked ſlowly on
notwithſtanding; but quitting the cliffs,
on account of the gales of wind which now
blew from the ſea, ſhe went along a narrow
paſs, where there was a cairn or heap of
ſtones looſely piled together, the work of
the firſt wild natives of the country; and
as that was as far as ſhe thought it proper
to venture from the houſe, though it was
not more than eight o'clock, ſhe leaned
penſively againſt it, and watched with ſome
ſurpriſe the fluctuations of the clouds that
were wildly driven by the wind acroſs the
diſk of the moon, and liſtened with a kind
of chill awe, to the loud yet hollow echo
of the wind among the hills; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſobbed with ſtormy violence for a
moment, and then ſuddenly ſinking, was
ſucceeded by a pauſe more terrible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0206900203:53"/>
It was in one of theſe moments of alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſilence, that Celeſtina thought ſhe ſaw
the ſhadow of a human form for a moment
on the ground, as if the perſon was behind
her who occaſioned it. She was very little
ſubject to fear; but the lonelineſs of the
place, and her own deſponding ſpirits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
made her ſtart with terror and turn
round. Something immediately glided
away; and convinced that the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
had not been the work of fancy,
ſhe haſtened with quick ſteps from the
place, and hardly at the diſtance of above
a hundred yards, ventured to look behind
her. She fancied that ſhe ſaw a man
ſtanding in the place ſhe had left; and the
ſtrange ſuperſtitions of the iſlands, of
which ſhe had heard much ſince her reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, crowding at that moment on
her mind, ſhe became extremely terrified,
and hurried on with ſuch unguarded ſpeed,
that a little before ſhe reached the houſe
ſhe trod on a looſe ſtone, that turned under
her foot, and ſhe fell with ſome violence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0206900203:54"/>
and with conſiderable pain; which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the fear ſhe had before felt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a momentary ſtupor, from which
ſhe was awakened by finding herſelf eagerly
raiſed from the ground by ſome perſon,
who wildly expreſſed his fears for her
ſafety, and in whoſe voice ſhe recognized,
with aſtoniſhment that deprived her of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,
Montague Thorold. Surprize at
that moment conquered the pain ſhe felt:
"Oh! Mr. Montague!" cried ſhe, "is
it poſſible? For heaven's ſake what
brought you hither?"</p>
            <p>"No matter what," replied he eagerly:
"think not—aſk not about me!—when
you are yourſelf hurt—in pain—bruiſed, I
fear, by your fall!"</p>
            <p>"I have no hurt ſo great," ſaid Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
riſing and attempting to walk: "I feel
no bodily pain ſo acute, as that which your
extraordinary conduct gives me."</p>
            <p>"Let me aſſiſt you into the houſe," in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
he. "Do you not ſee that the
tempeſt, which has been gathering the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0206900203:55"/>
whole evening in the ſouth-weſt, is now
driving hither with uncommon fury?"</p>
            <p>"And let it come," anſwered ſhe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidly:
"I am juſt now ſo very unhappy
myſelf—I feel ſo much for the unhappineſs
of my friends, particularly of your father,
that it is indifferent to me what comes."</p>
            <p>"It is not for <hi>me,</hi> at leaſt, that you
feel," anſwered he: "that I know but
too well: but undoubtedly you will be
greatly concerned for poor Elphinſtone,
whoſe boat has been beating about ever
ſince night-fall, within a mile of the ſhore,
at the imminent hazard of being daſhed to
pieces."</p>
            <p>At this information Celeſtina forgot her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
forgot the uneaſy aſtoniſhment into
which the unexpected preſence of Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold had thrown her, and the
danger of Elphinſtone occupied all her
thoughts. "Oh! where!" cried ſhe,
"where is he? Shew me the bark which
is in ſo much hazard, and for heaven's
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0206900203:56"/>
ſake call the people, who are not, perhaps,
aware of it's danger."</p>
            <p>"Alas!" anſwered he, "ſeveral men
have been upon the ſhore above half an
hour, alarmed, as I was, at the danger the
veſſel was in of ſtriking on the rocks, which
ſhe has got among from the unexpected
ſhifting of the wind; but in their preſent
ſtate no human aſſiſtance can do them any
ſervice."</p>
            <p>He had, during this dialogue, taken her
arm, and led her towards a point of the
rock, where ſhe ſaw, by the pale and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
light of a moon, wrapped continually
in volumes of clouds, the boat ſtruggling
among the dark heavy waves which often
totally concealed it, and continually driven
by the ſudden guſts of violent wind from
the point it was attempting to reach.</p>
            <p>She now ſaw and ſhuddered at the peril
of thoſe who were in it: but ſtill fancying
it was poſſible to afford them aſſiſtance,
ſhe felt impatient and almoſt angry that
Montague Thorold, holding her arm
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0206900203:57"/>
within his, ſtood gazing when ſhe fancied
he might be helping. "Why ſtand here,"
cried ſhe, "when we might be of uſe in
ſummoning people to the aſſiſtance of thoſe
poor creatures?" While ſhe yet ſpoke,
and while Montague, though not leſs alive
to their diſtreſs, was leſs ſanguine in the
hope to aſſiſt them, and therefore ſtill heſitated,
ſhe diſengaged herſelf haſtily from
his arm, and flew towards the houſe, no
longer conſcious of any thing but their
danger: before ſhe could reach it, though
the diſtance was not a quarter of a mile, the
wind ſuddenly blew with treble fury, and
a hail ſtorm accompanied it, againſt which
ſhe found it difficult to ſtand. She found the
door open, and Mrs. Elphinſtone, whom
the wind and the talking of the ſervants
had awakened, already below. Trembling
with apprehenſion, which the ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Celeſtina encreaſed—"Good
God, my dear friend, what is the matter?"
cried ſhe, "and why are you out in ſo
dreadful a night?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0206900203:58"/>
"Ah! dear Madam!" replied Celeſtina:
"Mr. Elphinſtone—his boat—"</p>
            <p>"What of him?" interrupted her terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
friend: "is he drowned? is he loſt?"</p>
            <p>"No, no! I hope, I believe not," cried
Celeſtina; "but a boat, which they ſay
is his, is beating off the iſland, and the
people are afraid it will go to pieces."</p>
            <p>This was enough for the unhappy Mrs.
Elphinſtone, who ſeeing, in it's moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
light, the evil which threatened her,
now ran herſelf wildly towards the beach;
while Celeſtina, overtaking her with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
perſuaded her to accept her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—aſſiſtance
which ſhe was very little
able to give.</p>
            <p>The ſad event had happened before the
trembling friends had reached the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
The boat ſtriking on the ſunken
rocks, to ſave it from which the united
efforts of the little crew had been exerted
in vain, was ſtaved to pieces, and the
unhappy men, already exhauſted with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
were unable to reſiſt by ſwimming,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0206900203:59"/>
the violence of the ſea. Mrs. Elphinſtone
and Celeſtina looked out in vain for the
place where a few moments before the boat
had been ſeen: no veſtige of it remained,
and they ſaw only, by the waining moon,
which but ſerved to lend new horrors to the
view, the wild waves daſhing over theſe
rocks in ſheets of white foam; while the
fury of the winds and the beating of the
rain hardly allowed them to ſtand on the
precipice that overlooked the ſcene of
ſtormy deſolation.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina doubted but little of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and therefore endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
her unfortunate friend to return to
the houſe; but this was impoſſible: ſhe
continued to wander backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for ſome moments, till terror quite
overcame her; and ſhe threw herſelf on
the ground, ſaying, in a low and ſolemn
voice to Celeſtina—"Elphinſtone is
drowned; I know he is; and here I will
wait to ſee his corps, which will be driven
on ſhore in the morning." Then ſtarting
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0206900203:60"/>
up, ſhe would have gone down to the
ſhore, from an idea which ſuddenly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to her that he might yet be ſaved
by ſwimming. Celeſtina, not knowing
whether it was beſt to prevent or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
her, unable to diſſimulate and affect
hope ſhe did not feel, was in a ſituation
hardly better than that of her diſtracted
friend whom ſhe ſupported, when Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold joined them. Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone,
occupied only by the terror of
the moment, took no notice of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
circumſtance of a ſtranger, whom
ſhe had never ſeen before, thus ſuddenly
appearing; but unconſcious of every
thing, and heedleſs of who he was, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
in accents of piercing anguiſh his
aſſiſtance to help her down the winding
path which led to the beach. He lent it,
though very certain that the cataſtrophe
had already taken place which by her ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and wild enquiries he ſaw ſhe yet
thought doubtful; and giving her one
arm, while with the other he claſped the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0206900203:61"/>
trembling hand of Celeſtina, they reached
the place, where ſeven or eight men were
already aſſembled. The moon was by
this time down, and the darkneſs was only
broken by livid flaſhes of faint lightning,
which, with the thunder muttering at a
diſtance, encreaſed the horrors of the
ſtorm. Amid the black and ſwelling
waves, however, objects were ſeen floating,
and many of theſe heavy ſeas had not
broken on the ſhore, before theſe objects
were diſcerned to be the bodies of thoſe
who had periſhed, and that of the ill fated
Elphinſtone was one of the firſt which was
thrown on the beach, and too well known
by his unhappy wife. She now no longer
remembered all the cauſes of uneaſineſs
that her huſband had given her; but ſaw
only Elphinſtone, once ſo fondly beloved,
the poſſeſſor of her firſt affections, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her children, a disfigured corpſe
before her. Her native ſtrength of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and the calmneſs acquired by
habitual ſuffering, forſook her at once, and

grief produced a momentary phrenzy, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which fearful paroxyſm, Celeſtina, whoſe
preſence of mind was now ſummoned to
the aſſiſtance of her poor unhappy friend,
had her conveyed with great difficulty to
the houſe; where Montague Thorold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
them both with the moſt aſſiduous
tenderneſs, ſhe watched for many days
over the diſordered intellects of the ill fated
Mrs. Elphinſtone before ſhe ſaw them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.
At length the violence of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which Celeſtina found means to
ſoften by preſenting her children continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to her, and talking to her of thoſe
that were abſent, ſunk into the calm torpor
of deſpair. She heard nothing, ſhe ſaw
nothing but the children, whom ſhe would
not ſuffer to be a moment abſent from her;
and the agitation of her mind preying on
her ſlender frame, ſhe was reduced to a
ſtate of languor which made Celeſtina
tremble for her life.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina had, immediately after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
event, written to Cathcart, deſiring his <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0206900203:67"/>
directions, and even entreating him to
come, himſelf to fetch them all from a place
where there was now no reaſon for their
ſtay. But ſhe knew that it muſt be five
or ſix weeks before ſhe could have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
and hardly dared truſt herſelf to
meditate on the ſcenes of diſtreſs ſhe muſt
in that time encounter.</p>
            <p>Amid all the horrors however which had
ſurrounded her, ſhe had not forgotten the
fears and alarms to which ſhe knew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Montague Thorold expoſed his
father, her benefactor; ſhe ſeized the firſt
interval, after the death of Elphinſtone, to
urge to him the cruelty of his conduct,
and to entreat him to return home; but
he replied, that nothing on earth ſhould
induce him to leave the place where ſhe
was, while there was a probability of his
being of uſe to her; and that whether ſhe
admitted him to ſee her, or drove her from
him, the iſland ſhould be his reſidence
while ſhe remained in it. All that then
remained for her was, to write to Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0206900203:68"/>
which ſhe did under cover to Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart,
acquainting him as briefly as ſhe
could of the unexpected appearance of his
ſon, and all that had happened ſince.</p>
            <p>Having thus far acquitted herſelf, ſhe
found herſelf in a ſituation in which it was
almoſt impoſſible for her to help receiving
the aſſiſtance of one to whom ſhe trembled
to be obliged, while ſhe knew it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and augmented a paſſion that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſoned
his life. On him, however, ſhe
was compelled to entruſt the regulation of
the laſt melancholy offices that were to
be performed for poor Elphinſtone, who
was interred in a little ruined chapel about
two miles from his late reſidence; his
wife conſenting reluctantly to this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and taking opiates inceſſantly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that torpor which alone prevented the
more violent ebullitions of grief from ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her again, when the remains of her
huſband were removed.</p>
            <p>Recourſe to opiates became gradually a
habit with Mrs. Elphinſtone; and though
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0206900203:69"/>
Celeſtina trembled for the conſequences,
ſhe thought it almoſt inhuman to oppoſe
the application of any remedy, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch circumſtances, won her friend
from ſorrow even for an hour. Yet the
frequent abſences it occaſioned, compelled
her to be very long and very often alone
with Montague Thorold, to whoſe manly
tenderneſs on the late ſad occaſion ſhe could
not be inſenſible, and to whoſe unceaſing
attention ſhe was every hour more obliged.
In the firſt conference they had held when
the melancholy event to which they had
been witneſſes allowed them to talk of
themſelves, Celeſtina, after urging him to
return to his father by every motive with
which reaſon and truth ſupplied her, repeated
to him with great firmneſs her reſolution
never to marry if Willoughby was not her
huſband, and repreſented very forcibly the
cruelty as well as abſurdity of his purſuing
her; to which he replied, that he knew all
ſhe repreſented before he came thither,
that his only wiſh was to be allowed to ſee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0206900203:70"/>
her, though at a diſtance, and his only
gratification, that of being ſuffered to
breathe the ſame air; that it was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
privilege of every human being to
purſue their happineſs when it injured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body;
and that finding <hi>his</hi> conſiſted in
being near her, though without even the
hope of her admitting him into her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
he had followed that axiom, and
had for ſome weeks, been the diſtant and
unſeen companion of all her walks. "I
was the highlander," ſaid he, "who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the vacancy I had before taken care
to make when you went your excurſion on
the water. I am the perſon of whom you
have ſometimes caught a glimpſe at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and who would never have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
you nearer, had not my fears for
you the evening of the ſtorm thrown me
off my guard, and induced me to conceal
myſelf within a few yards of you, behind
thoſe piled up ſtones againſt which you
leaned. Ah! I heard you ſigh—I heard
the name of Willoughby repeated with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0206900203:71"/>
tenderneſs! but I bore it all! and nothing,
believe me, nothing but your fall, your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
danger, could have compelled me
to break the vow I had made never to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
upon you—never to offend you with
my unhappy paſſion!"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina could not help being affected
with the melancholy ſolemnity with which
he uttered theſe words; but making an
effort to prevent his perceiving it, ſhe
ſaid—"It is abſolutely neceſſary now that
you again take up as much of ſo proper a
reſolution as relates to not ſpeaking to me
on a topic which to you muſt be uſeleſs,
and to me painful; and while you perſiſt in
remaining here, let me at leaſt owe it to
your complaiſance not to be diſtreſſed by
declarations to which I cannot, ought not,
will not liſten."</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, then laying his
hand on his heart, aſſured her that if ſhe
would allow him only to ſee her, indulge
him only with being uſeful to her in her
preſent remote and comfortleſs reſidence,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0206900203:72"/>
he never would again name to her the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which he knew, he ſaid, he muſt carry
to the grave; and from that moment he
kept his word; though Celeſtina ſaw, with
more emotion perhaps than the warmeſt
declarations could have given her, his
painful ſtruggles and continual contention
with himſelf: but while her pity for him
encreaſed, ſhe ſtudied more carefully to
conceal from him that ſhe felt any, and
behaved with as much calm politeneſs as
ſhe could have done towards the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
man in the world.</p>
            <p>To beguile the tedious moments during
which they were compelled to wait the
hoped for arrival of Cathcart, and while
the ſea that ſurrounded them was agitated
continually by the wintry tempeſt, Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
had recourſe to the books with which
poor Elphinſtone, who, among all his
faults and errors, was not without taſte,
had furniſhed a cloſet in the houſe. Mrs.
Elphinſtone, moved by the repreſentations
of Celeſtina to attend to her health for the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0206900203:73"/>
ſake of her children, whoſe ſole dependance
was now on her, conſented by degrees to
liſten while Celeſtina read. Montague
Thorold, whoſe reſidence was at the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a highlander that boaſted of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two rooms and a chimney, about a mile
farther on the iſland, was ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to theſe parties; and as Celeſtina
was ſoon fatigued, and as he read remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
well, Mrs. Elphinſtone appeared
pleaſed with his taking occaſionally the
office of their reader, and gradually he
became accuſtomed to attend them every
afternoon, and to read aloud to them till
the hour of their ſimple ſupper.</p>
            <p>Among the books in this little collection,
there were ſeveral that Celeſtina recollected
as the peculiar favourites of Willoughby;
and the remembrance of thoſe days when
heread them to her, though never a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
abſent from her thoughts, were now
moſt forcibly recalled by hearing them
again repeated. Some pieces of poetry
particularly affected her, from their ſimple
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0206900203:74"/>
pathos, and the manner in which Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold read them; while they often
drew tears from the unhappy Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
an effect at which Celeſtina rejoiced,
as her grief was now ſettled into that ſtill
and ſullen melancholy unſolicitous of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
and incapable of receiving it;
which, while it produces a degree of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
calmneſs, preys with fatal power on
the heart.</p>
            <p>Thus paſſed the heavy hours; till at
length, after a fortnight longer delay than
they had reckoned upon, letters were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from Cathcart: they contained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that old Winnington was dead,
and Jeſſy in ſuch a ſtate of health as made
it almoſt impoſſible for Cathcart to leave
her. He therefore beſouglit Celeſtina to
accept the protection of Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
for herſelf, for Mrs. Elphinſtone, and
her children, and to haſten to his houſe,
where he was now as able as happy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, as ſoon as was poſſible and
ſafe. Mr. Thorold wrote alſo to Celeſtina,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0206900203:75"/>
and expreſſed his hope that the wild eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity
of his ſon, which had occaſioned to
him ſo much pain, might at leaſt be of
ſervice to her, and entreated her to allow
him to attend her and her unfortunate
friend into Devonſhire, where he aſſured
her he would prevent her receiving any
trouble from the importunities of Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
ſhould he be weak enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
too much on her favour. He wrote
alſo to his ſon; but after the contents of
that letter Celeſtina did not enquire, and
Montague carefully concealed them.</p>
            <p>It was now determined that the plan
laid down by Cathcart and Mr. Thorold
ſhould be purſued. Montague undertook
the arrangement of every thing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ten days they were ready to depart.</p>
            <p>The weather alone ſeemed now likely to
prevent their croſſing the water. Mrs.
Elphinſtone, who had till now feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
being ſo apprehenſive for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that every guſt of wind, every ſwell
of the ſea, made her ſhrink back with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0206900203:76"/>
and poſtpone from day to day a little
voyage which ſhe yet earneſtly wiſhed
over. It was the end of November, and
very good weather could hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
Dark and gloomy days, with
ſtorms of wind and rain, ſucceeded each
other; and Celeſtina, whoſe thoughts had
been of late called frequently from her own
mournful contemplations to the acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
of others, now relapſed again into
that deſponding ſtate of mind which her
long abſence from Willoughby and his
apparent neglect of her unavoidably threw
her into. She had confined herſelf a good
deal to the houſe ſince Montague Thorold
had been ſo much with them, becauſe
there either Mrs. Elphinſtone or the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were uſually in the room, and ſhe by
that means avoided being alone with him;
but now, as he was more engaged by the
preparations for their departure, which he
had undertaken to ſuperintend, and in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
poor Elphinſtone's accounts with his
employers, Celeſtina again ventured out
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0206900203:77"/>
of an evening whenever ſhe could eſcape
unſeen.</p>
            <p>In one of theſe walks, along the edge of
very ſteep rocks, where the ſcene preſented
only deſolation: the dark and turbulent
ſea on one ſide, and on the other a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of mountains, which ſeemed to
have been thrown upon each other in ſome
tremendous convulſion of nature, ſhe
turned towards the yet more dreary North,
and reflected on the condition of thoſe
whom the poet deſcribes as
<q>The laſt of men,</q>
the inhabitants of Siberia, of Lapland, and
thoſe extreme regions where
<q>Life at laſt goes out.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"Alas!" cried ſhe, "if they have not our
enjoyments, they ſuffer not from thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities
which embitter our days. Their
ſhort ſummer paſſes in laying up neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for their long winter; and with what
their deſolate region affords them they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0206900203:78"/>
are content, becauſe they know not that
there are comforts and conveniencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what it affords them. Void of the
wiſh and the power to obſerve other
modes of life, they are content with their
own, and though little ſuperior in point
of intellect to the animal from which they
derive their ſupport, yet they are happy,
if not from the poſſeſſion of good, at
leaſt from the abſence of evil; from that
ſickneſs of the ſoul which we taſte from
deprivation and diſappointment."</p>
            <p>A deep ſigh cloſed this ſhort ſoliloquy;
and after indulging a little longer this
train of thought, it produced the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſonnet:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0206900203:79"/>
                  <head>THE LAPLANDER.</head>
                  <l>The ſhivering native, who by Tenglio's ſide</l>
                  <l>Beholds with fond regret the parting light</l>
                  <l>Sink far away, beneath the darkening tide,</l>
                  <l>And leave him to long months of dreary night,</l>
                  <l>Yet knows, that ſpringing from the eaſtern wave,</l>
                  <l>The ſun's glad beams ſhall re-illume his way,</l>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>A few days after this, an interval of
calm weather gave to Mrs. Elphinſtone
courage to determine on embarking: but
the evening before that on which it was
finally fixed that they ſhould go, ſhe told
Celeſtina, with a ſolemnity of voice and
manner that convinced her ſhe was not to
be diverted from her purpoſe, that ſhe
could not be ſatisfied to leave the iſland
without viſiting the ſpot where lay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0206900203:80"/>
of her huſband. Celeſtina, without
much hope of ſucceſs, repreſented to her
how wrong it was to yield, or rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
ſorrow, unavailing to it's object,
and injurious to thoſe who were his living
repreſentatives, by depriving her of her calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of mind when exertion was moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and injuring her own health, now ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
precious to them. To theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
her poor friend replied, with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
compoſure, that ſhe ſhould ſuffer more
in reflecting on her omiſſion than ſhe could
do in fulfilling what ſhe had perſuaded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was a duty. Celeſtina therefore agreed
to accompany her that evening. Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold had already ſhewn her the
place, and Mrs. Elphinſtone deſired to
have no other witneſs to her ſorrows, than
the ſoft hearted and pitying friend, without
whoſe generous ſympathy ſhe would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
long before have ſunk under them.</p>
            <p>It was near two months ſince the death
of Elphinſtone, when this melancholy fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
viſit was to be paid by his widow. A
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0206900203:81"/>
calm but ſullen day, with an overclouded
ſky, threatening ſnow, was ſucceeded by a
dark but mild evening. The diſtant ſun
had left a few lines of red light in the
weſtern horizon; and the moon, within a
day or two of being at the full, edged with
fainter rays the oppoſite clouds, through
which it appeared not but at intervals.
The unhappy widow, leaning on the arm
of her tender friend, walked ſlowly and
with languid ſteps, as ſhe was guided to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ruined chapel, and a univerſal
pauſe of nature ſeemed to reſpect her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows!
Not a breath of air wandered
among the channels of the hills, and the
waterfalls murmured low and hollow at a
diſtance; the ſea was calm, and being low
on the ſands, was hardly heard; while the
birds, and few animals who inhabited the
land, were retired to their repoſe.</p>
            <p>Around this little chapel, now more than
half in ruins, a few rude ſtones were raiſed
to the memory of the dead of former times.
The graſs and weeds concealed many, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0206900203:82"/>
on the reſt no figures but thoſe of croſſes
rudely cut were now viſible. Elphinſtone
had been interred within the walls of the
edifice itſelf; his widow deſired her friend
to enter it with her, to ſhew her the place,
and to leave her.</p>
            <p>As they approached the ſpot, the ground
ſounded hollow beneath their feet, and a
mournful echo ran round the damp walls.
The moon, darting for a moment through
the ruined ſtone work of the diſmantled
window, ſhewed them a broken table that
had once been the altar, on which ſome
pieces of the gothic ornaments of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and ſeveral human bones, were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and near it, the newly turned up
earth, on which a few ſtones were looſely
piled, diſcovered the grave of poor El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone.
Celeſtina could not truſt her
voice to point it out; but leading her
friend to it, ſhe immediately comprehended
that there lay the remains of her huſband,
and fetching a deep ſigh, ſhe ſtopped at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:0206900203:83"/>
"I had better not leave you ſurely,"
cried Celeſtina mournfully. "I cannot
bear to leave you in this dreadful place."</p>
            <p>"Pray oblige me," replied her friend;
"it is the laſt indulgence I will aſk, and I
promiſe not to ſtay long."</p>
            <p>"I will wait for you without then," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Celeſtina; "and pray, dear Sophy,
conſider your children, and let it not be
long that you indulge this ſad propenſity."</p>
            <p>She then went out of the chapel; and
ſeating herſelf on one of the ruined, monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
near it's entrance, yielded to all the
gloomy thoughts which the place, the hour,
and the occaſion inſpired. "Ah! who
knows," cried ſhe, "whether I too may
not have reaſon to lament even as this poor
mourner, whoſe groans tear my heart to
pieces while I liſten to them! I hear her!
ſhe implores forgiveneſs of the ſhade of
her departed huſband for all the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
offences ſhe committed againſt him:
ſhe, whoſe whole life has been one courſe
of ſuffering, ſolicits forgiveneſs of him to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0206900203:84"/>
whom thoſe ſufferings were owing: ſhe
forgets his faults towards her, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
only that he once loved her, that he
was the huſband of her youth, and that he
is gone for ever; while ſhe trembles for
the future fate of him, whoſe errors ſhe only
remembers to recommend them to mercy!
Dreadful then is the final ſeparation even
from thoſe, of whom, though we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to complain, we have once loved: ah!
what muſt it be when an eternal barrier is
put between us and thoſe whom we unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
and paſſionately love. Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by!
if I have regretted ſo deeply our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
what would become of me ſhould
I ever hang over the grave where thy
adored form moulders in the duſt. Oh!
God! grant that I never ſuſtain a trial like
that!"</p>
            <p>Overwhelmed by theſe ſad thoughts,
and terrified at the encreaſing darkneſs and
fearful ſilence, which was broken only by
the deep ſighs of her unhappy friend proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
on the grave of her huſband, ſhe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0206900203:85"/>
ſtarted up to recall her from her mournful
employment, when Montague Thorold,
breathleſs with haſte and anxiety, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
her; ſhe was glad to recognize
him, and took the hand he offered her;
while he cried impatiently—"Wherefore
is all this, my dear Madam, and where is
your friend?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina led him to the place, ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ſhe approached, while Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
recovering herſelf by an effort of
reſolution, and having perhaps diſburthened
her oppreſſed heart and ſatisfied her
mournful propenſity, agreed immediately
to go with them, and having turned once
more her ſtreaming eyes on the ſpot as ſhe
quitted the chapel, ſhe ſuffered each of her
friends to take an arm, and lead her home
in ſilence; where Montague Thorold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
her and Celeſtina to take immediately
a few hours reſt, as the tide would ſerve
very early in the morning for their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation
in the veſſel which now lay ready
to receive them.</p>

They followed his advice; and before
day break on the twentieth of December,
near ſeven months after their arrival in the
Iſle of Skie, they quitted it; and landing
ſafely on the coaſt of Scotland, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with very great fatigue, though

            <p>AS Mrs. Elphinſtone was too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to allow her to go out, Celeſtina, who
had great pleaſure in viſiting antiquities, and
whoſe active mind was perpetually in ſearch
of new ideas, was compelled either to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
theſe gratifications, or to permit
Montague Thorold only to accompany
her. He was generally ſo guarded in his
converſation, that, though it was eaſy to
ſee how much he ſuffered in ſuppreſſing
his paſſion, Celeſtina had no reaſonable
ground of complaint. He found, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at Edinburgh, that it was particularly
uneaſy to her to viſit the places ſhe wiſhed
to ſee without ſome other companion, and
recollecting that one of the profeſſors was
well known to his father, he made uſe of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0206900203:92"/>
the claim that acquaintance gave him, and
by that means Celeſtina received all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and hoſpitality for which the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
nation are ſo juſtly praiſed. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to whom ſhe thus became known,
had ſeveral daughters, amiable and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
young women: with them ſhe ſaw all
that the capital of Scotland afforded wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of obſervation; with them ſhe viſited
the ruinous chapel and magnificently
mournful apartments of Holyrood Houſe,
and gave a ſigh to the fate of the lovely,
luckleſs Mary, who was almoſt its laſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſovereign. Then parting with her
newly acquired friends with mutual regret,
ſhe proceeded on her road to England,
nothing particular occurring on the way
for ſome time except the ſlow but evident
amendment of Mrs. Elphinſtone's ſpirits,
and the ſymptoms of encreaſed attachment
in Montague Thorold; who, if he loved
her before with an attachment fatal to his
peace and ſubverſive of his proſpects, now
ſeemed to idolize her with an ardour bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0206900203:93"/>
on phrenzy. In deſpite of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhe had avowed to him, in deſpite
of thoſe he had himſelf formed, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and invincible paſſion was viſible in
every thing he ſaid and did. He ſeemed
to have forgotten that he had any other
buſineſs in the world than to ſerve her, to
liſten to the enchantment of her voice, to
watch every change of her countenance.
His whole being was abſorbed in that one
ſentiment; and though he had promiſed
not to conſider the advantages, which his
own wild Quixotiſm, aided by accident,
had thus obtained for him, as making the
leaſt alteration in the decided preference
of Celeſtina for another, he inſenſibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
at leaſt at times, her unalterable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Willoughby; and ſeeing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all her attempts to conceal it, that
ſhe pitied him, that ſhe was not inſenſible
of his attempts to pleaſe her nor blind to
his powers of pleaſing, he cheriſhed, in
defiance of reaſon and conviction (from
which he fled as much as poſſible) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0206900203:94"/>
hope that the barrier, whatever
it was, between her and Willoughby would
be found invincible, and that the time,
though it might yet be remote, would at
length arrive when he ſhould himſelf be
allowed to aſpire to her favour.</p>
            <p>The human mind, however ſtrong,
yields too eaſily to theſe illuſions, whence
at leaſt it enjoys the ſoft conſolations of
hope, and ſees rays of light, which, though
imaginary, perhaps are all we often have to
carry us on with courage over the rugged
way, too thickly ſown with real, or, miſſing
them, with imaginary and ſelf-created evils.</p>
            <p>It is therefore little to be wondered at, if
Montague Thorold, ſo ſanguine in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
of ſo little experience in life,
(for he was yet hardly twenty two) and ſo
much in love, ſhould thus eagerly feed
himſelf with hopes of its ultimate ſucceſs,
and be wilfully deaf to every argument
which reaſon would have brought againſt
the reality of the gay viſions he cheriſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0206900203:95"/>
Celeſtina, pitying and eſteeming him,
was very anxious to reduce this unhappy
and fruitleſs prepoſſeſſion to the bounds of
friendſhip and eſteem, and though ſhe at this
time thought of Willoughby with ſo much
internal anguiſh that ſhe never on other
occaſions willingly named him, yet ſhe
now took occaſion ſometimes to ſpeak of
him, and purpoſely laid her train of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
in ſuch a way with Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
as gave Montague Thorold to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that her ſentiments in regard to
him who had firſt poſſeſſed and ſtill was
maſter of her heart, could never ſuffer any
material change, or be transferred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even though ſhe was ſure that ſhe
was perſonally divided from him for ever.</p>
            <p>After ſome days travelling, which the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor
of Mrs. Elphinſtone, and her extreme
anxiety about her children, rendered tedious,
the party arrived at York, and there it was
determined to remain two days. Celeſtina,
who had nobody to receive her at the end
of her pilgrimage with peculiar delight,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0206900203:96"/>
was not very eager to finiſh it; Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone,
ſeeing nothing but poverty and
dependence before her, of which her mind,
being enfeebled by grief, was little able to bear
a nearer proſpect, was yet leſs anxious; and
Montague Thorold cared not how long a
journey laſted which gave him what he
muſt at its termination loſe, the happineſs
of being with, and of being uſeful to the
miſtreſs of his heart.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at York, there was
an appearance of ſnow; it fell with violence
during the night, and by ten o'clock the
next morning the north road was rendered
impaſſable.</p>
            <p>The travellers were well aſſured that
in a day or two it would be ſufficiently
beat for them to proceed with ſafety, and
as their original intention was to remain at
leaſt two days, the farther immaterial delay
with which this circumſtance threatened
them, gave to none of them any concern.</p>
            <p>The ſnow, however, continued to fall
very heavily, and the cold became almoſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0206900203:97"/>
inſupportably ſevere. The party were
drawn round a good fire at the inn, and
Mrs. Elphinſtone had juſt put her children
to bed, when an unuſual clamour and buſtle
below attracted their attention. Horſes
were called for, and a loud voice was heard
to ſay—"If four are not ſufficient, my
maſter will have fourteen rather than be
ſtopped a moment."</p>
            <p>"This is ſome matrimonial expedition,"
cried Montague Thorold, "or why all
this haſte?" The idea, which the ladies
allowed to be probable, excited ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of curioſity, and when the waiter ſoon
after came in to lay the cloth for ſupper,
Montague could not forbear enquiring if
the horſes which were a ſhort time before
ſo eagerly called for were not for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of a young couple haſtening
into Scotland. The man replied that the
gentleman was going into Scotland, and
had been ſtopped by the ſnow about ſeven
miles off, the horſes he had to his chaiſe
being unable, to draw him; but that he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0206900203:98"/>
underſtood he was quite alone, that horſes
and men had been ſent to his aſſiſtance, and
that he was expected there preſently.</p>
            <p>The man, who probably loved to hear
himſelf talk, went on to inform them,
though they now no longer felt any great
degree of curioſity, that the gentleman's
valet de chambre and one of the poſtillions,
who had come forward, (who were warming
themſelves at the fire below before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
back as they were ordered,) had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that they were almoſt dead with
cold; "but as for that, Sir," continued
the waiter, "he ſays, that is, Sir, the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
de ſham</hi> ſays, ſays he, my maſter if
once he've got a ſcheme in his head, 'tis
not cold, no nor water, nor fire neither,
<hi>as</hi> will find it an eaſy matter to ſtop him,
and then, ſays he, as. for fatigue to his
own ſelf, ſays he, or danger, or any thing
of the like nature, or expence, though it
coſt him a hundred, aye or a thouſand
pounds, why my maſter, ſays he, minds
it no more than nothing; 'tis all one to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0206900203:99"/>
him; yet to be ſure, ſays he, he is a good
maſter in the main, and no ſneaker, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in money, nor liquor, nor no other
accommodation to ſervants."</p>
            <p>"And pray," ſaid Montague Thorold,
"who is this courageous, bountiful, and
accommodating gentleman?"</p>
            <p>"I did not think to aſk his name, Sir,"
replied the waiter, "but I can know in a
minute." He then, without waiting for
an anſwer, ran down ſtairs, and returning
almoſt inſtantly, ſaid that the gentleman
was 'Squire Vavaſour of Staffordſhire.</p>
            <p>"Vavaſour!" cried Celeſtina in a faint
voice, and turning as pale as death.
"Good Heaven! to what purpoſe can
Vavaſour be travelling in ſuch haſte to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Scotland."</p>
            <p>"Vavaſour!" echoed Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
his countenance betraying all that
paſſed in his heart: "Vavaſour! Ah!
Miſs De Mornay, it was to you he was
undoubtedly going. Willoughby is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0206900203:100"/>
and ſends his friend to reclaim his
betrothed wife."</p>
            <p>"Sends his friend! oh! no, no," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Celeſtina with quickneſs, "that
cannot be: were Willoughby returned, he
would not <hi>ſend;</hi> rather it is ſome ſad news
he has to impart, and I muſt prepare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for it—I muſt bear it be it what it
may."</p>
            <p>The cruelleſt anxiety now took poſſeſſion
of both Celeſtina and Montague Thorold;
they both dreaded an explanation, though
unable to bear the ſuſpenſe. Thorold
went down to ſee what he could gather
from the men; but Mr. Vavaſour's ſervant
was gone back to meet his maſter, and the
poſtillion had only come with him from the
laſt poſt town. Celeſtina in the mean
time now traverſed the room, now went
to the window, and now appeared to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the conjectures Mrs. Elphinſtone
offered, that perhaps this journey might in
no reſpect relate to her, but might be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to one of thoſe ſudden ſtarts of caprice
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0206900203:101"/>
in which Vavaſour was known to indulge
himſelf.</p>
            <p>This ſtate of ſuſpenſe and conjecture,
which is of all others leaſt eaſy to be borne,
did not laſt long, for in about a quarter of
an hour the carriage, in which Vavaſour
himſelf was, arrived.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina now debated within herſelf
whether ſhe ought to ſend to him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him of her being on her way to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
or ſuffer him to proceed, whither
ſhe doubted not he was going, even to the
Hebrides in ſearch of her. This internal
debate was however ſhort: her extreme
ſolicitude to have news of Willoughby ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceded
every other thought; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vavaſour was going to Scotland to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
her fate to her by the direction of
Willoughby, or merely in conſequence of
ſome whim of his own, ſhe knew that he
in all probability could give her ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of him of whom ſhe moſt wiſhed
to hear. Montague Thorold, who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
leaſt in conſequence of this interview
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0206900203:102"/>
all the day dreams in which he had been
indulging himſelf ſhould be at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
would have repreſented to her
ſome imaginary improprieties which his
wiſh to find them raiſed in his mind.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, however, had, with all her can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and humility, a deciſive ſpirit, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of her great good ſenſe, which, when
ſhe had once examined and determined on
any ſubject, did not leave her open to the
trifling perplexities of feeble and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
debate. She conſidered, that even
if Vavaſour <hi>was</hi> going on ſome eccentric
idea of his own to follow her into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
it would be cruel and unjuſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to purſue ſuch a journey at ſuch a
ſeaſon, and therefore ſteadily reſiſting all
the repreſentations of Montague Thorold
againſt it, ſhe addreſſed to him the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
note:</p>
            <p>"Miſs de Mornay preſents her compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Mr. Vavaſour, and having
learned by accident that he is at this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0206900203:103"/>
place, requeſts the favour of ſeeing him
to-morrow morning to breakfaſt with
Mrs. Elphinſtone and with her at half
paſt nine."</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, being unable wholly
to prevent, thought he could at leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
the delivery of this note till the next
day; but Celeſtina was too impatient to
hear of Willoughby to be blind to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
which Montague was too much in
love to manage very dexterouſly, and
therefore quitting the room herſelf, ſhe
found one of the waiters, who ſhe enjoined
to give the note to the gentleman who was
juſt arrived, as ſoon as he had done ſupper.</p>
            <p>This was not perhaps very diſcreet: but
Celeſtina thought much at the moment of
Willoughby, and very little of Vavaſour,
and in her anxiety to hear news of the
one, ſhe reflected not on the way in which
it might be conveyed by the other, who,
after a long and cold journey, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
his ſupper, was not likely at leaſt to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0206900203:104"/>
be a clear and calm meſſenger, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
reflection would have convinced her
that he was not a man who from motives of
delicate forbearance and polite deference
would put off the interview to the time ſhe
had named.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the note from Celeſtina
delivered to Vavaſour, than he ran up
ſtairs with an impatience amounting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to phrenzy, his eyes flaſhing fire, and
his countenance expreſſive of the violent
emotions with which he was agitated; he
hardly noticed Mrs. Elphinſtone, but caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a look of angry ſurpriſe at Montague
Thorold, whom he immediately knew, he
approached Celeſtina, took her hand, and
eagerly kiſſing it, told her in a hurried
manner that he was haſtening to Scotland
to give her intelligence of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and to deliver her a packet from
Willoughby.</p>
            <p>"From Willoughby!" replied Celeſtina,
ſo extremely affected by his abrupt entrance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0206900203:105"/>
that ſhe was ready to faint. "Is he well?
is he returned to England?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied he, without ſeeming
ſenſible of the nature of her ſufferings,
"not returned to England, or likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but—"</p>
            <p>"Is he married then?" ſaid Celeſtina,
interrupting him in a ſtill more trembling
voice.</p>
            <p>"Not yet, but I have a letter for you
which—"</p>
            <p>"Give it me," cried ſhe, hardly able
to breathe. He had it not about him, but
ringing for his ſervant, gave him the key
of his portmanteau, and bidding him bring
a large ſealed packet, which he ſaid he
would find there, the man immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with it; and Celeſtina, without
ſpeaking to Vavaſour, hurried away with
it in breathleſs agitation, Mrs. Elphinſtone,
alarmed at her looks, following her in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>All this time Montague Thorold had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
leaning againſt one of the piers:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0206900203:106"/>
with contracted brows and claſped hands
watching the countenance of Celeſtina,
while his own changed from pale to red,
from red again to pale. He had always
returned the diſlike which Vavaſour had
ſhewn towards him as much as his nature
could return diſlike; and this was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by the abrupt and unfeeling man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which Vavaſour had executed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
that, whether it brought to her
welcome or unwelcome tidings, demanded,
he thought, more delicacy and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
When Celeſtina and Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
were gone, he felt no inclination
therefore to ſtay with Vavaſour, who
walked up and down the room as if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
their return; but was preparing to
leave it, when, as he croſſed to the door,
Vavaſour, turning ſhort towards him, aſked
how he came to be at York with Miſs De
Mornay.</p>
            <p>"How I came, Sir!" replied Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague
Thorold with equal abruptneſs.
"Have <hi>you</hi> any right, Sir, to enquire?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0206900203:107"/>
"Yes," replied Vavaſour contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
"I have a right."</p>
            <p>"To enquire into my actions, Sir?" in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
Thorold; "ſurely not!"</p>
            <p>"To enquire into thoſe of Miſs De Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,
Sir, <hi>I have</hi> a right."</p>
            <p>"Well, Sir, if ſhe allows of that right,
to her you may then apply; but you will
be ſo good as to leave me at liberty to be
at York, or wherever elſe it is convenient
to me to be."</p>
            <p>"Not with her, Sir, you muſt not; not
with Miſs De Mornay, be aſſured. As for
the reſt, pray underſtand, that were it not
for the circumſtance of your being ſeen in
company with her, <hi>I</hi> ſhould never recollect
that ſuch a perſon was in the world as Mr.
Montague Thorold."</p>
            <p>Thorold, though naturally of a gentle
diſpoſition, was little diſpoſed to bear the
contemptuous arrogance of any man: he
therefore anſwered with more quickneſs,
that it was an honour he could well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with, to be thought of at all by <hi>ſuch</hi> a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0206900203:108"/>
man as Mr. Vavaſour. The tone in which
he ſpoke this, and the emphaſis he laid on
the words <hi>ſuch</hi> a man, provoked the
haughty and impetuous ſpirit of Vavaſour;
and words roſe ſo high between them, that
Mrs. Elphinſtone, who was only in the
next room, came in, and extremely terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
at their violence, beſought them to
ſeparate. Vavaſour, whoſe paſſions were
at all times too ſtrong to ſuffer him to liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
either to reaſon from others or to his
own, gave very little attention to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances;
but Montague Thorold, on
ſeeing her extreme uneaſineſs, and on
hearing the name of Celeſtina, became in
a moment apparently calm; and aſſuring
Mrs. Elphinſtone that ſhe had no reaſon to
be alarmed, he addreſſed himſelf coolly
to Vavaſour, and ſaid, that if he had any
buſineſs with him he would be at his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in the morning: he then beſought
Mrs. Elphinſtone to return to Celeſtina;
and taking her hand, led her out of the
room, aſſuring her in a whiſper that he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0206900203:109"/>
would not return that evening to Vavaſour,
nor have any farther contention with him.
"Make yourſelf eaſy, therefore, my dear
Madam," ſaid he, "and tell me—how is
our lovely friend? what are the contents
of a letter which required ſo extraordinary
a meſſenger?"</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone anſwered, that Celeſtina
had appeared in great emotion while ſhe
read the beginning of the letter, and then
telling her that ſhe ſhould finiſh it in her
own room, had left her, in encreaſed agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſhe thought, but without tears.</p>
            <p>"And ſhall you ſee her no more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night?"
enquired Montague Thorold.</p>
            <p>"I rather believe not," replied Mrs.
Elphinſtone.</p>
            <p>"And do you think," ſaid Thorold,
"do you think, my dear Madam, that the
agitation, the emotion you remarked, was
the effect of joy, of grief—"</p>
            <p>"Of grief, of diſappointment, of regret,
I think," anſwered ſhe. "I believe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
is now convinced that every proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0206900203:110"/>
of her becoming the wife of Mr.
Willoughby is at an end for ever."</p>
            <p>"Then," cried Montague Thorold,
unable to repreſs the violence of his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
"oh! then there will be hope for me!"</p>
            <p>There was ſomething like the tranſports
of phrenzy in the manner in which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
this, and Mrs. Elphinſtone was
ſhocked at it. "Be not too ſanguine, Mr.
Montague," ſaid ſhe. "I do not believe
that the affections of Miſs De Mornay are
to be eaſily or lightly transferred, but if
they were, think of the powerful claims
upon them that are uſing againſt your's."</p>
            <p>"Claims! what claims?" cried he:
"who ſhall dare to diſpute with me an heart
to which—"</p>
            <p>"Nay, nay," anſwered Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
"this is all phrenzy and wildneſs.
Do you not know that you have no claim,
though I am willing to allow all your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and do you not ſee that Willoughby,
in being compelled to reſign her, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0206900203:111"/>
his friend Vavaſour to her favour,
and therefore ſends him hither."</p>
            <p>"Vavaſour!" cried he: "recommend
Vavaſour to her! And would Celeſtina,
who, with all that dignified gentleneſs, has
a great deal of ſpirit, with a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
of her own value; would ſhe
bear to be conſigned, like a bale of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,
to a friend, and to ſuch a man as
Vavaſour? Impoſſible! he dare not think
of it: but I wiſh he may, for her inſulted
pride will mitigate the pain of her diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
love, and ſhe will be mine—the
charmer will be mine."</p>
            <p>The look, the manner, in which this
was uttered, encreaſed the concern of Mrs. Elphinſtone,
who, from her own recent
and ſevere ſufferings, had learned to dread
any thing like romantic eccentricity. She
laid her ſoft cold hand on the burning
hands of Montague Thorold, as they were
wildly claſped together—"My dear Sir,"
ſaid ſhe, in the gentleſt accents, "I owe
you a thouſand obligations for all the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0206900203:112"/>
you ſhewed me in my late calamitous
ſituation, and ill, very ill, ſhould I repay
thoſe obligations, if I did not try as a
friend to mitigate theſe violent tranſports.
Believe me, the heart of Celeſtina, fixed
in her early life to one object, is attached
to that object with more than common
firmneſs: Vavaſour's frantic fondneſs, and
your real merit, will, in my opinion, be
equally indifferent to her; and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that if Willoughby marries another,
as I conclude he will, Miſs De Mornay
will never marry at all."</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold could not bear this.
The idea of rivalry had been painful; but
the pain was mitigated by his knowledge
of her character and of the character of
Vavaſour, which, with all its avowed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſm,
he knew Celeſtina could not
even tolerate, and certainly not approve:
but the idea of her living only for Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
even when Willoughby lived for
another, was inſupportable, and ſince he
was unwilling to own it was poſſible, he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0206900203:113"/>
would therefore have been ready to quarrel
with any body but Mrs. Elphinſtone for
ſuppoſing it probable: but to every being
who was unfortunate, and eſpecially if that
unfortunate being was a woman, the kind
heart of Montague Thorold overflowed
with good will and ſympathy: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
checked himſelf; and ſaying he
ſhould be impatient to hear of Miſs De
Mornay in the morning, he wiſhed Mrs.
Elphinſtone a good night, and left her.</p>

            <p>IT was not till after two or three read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with a palpitating heart—a heart ſo
much agitated as hardly to leave her the
uſe of her reaſon, that Celeſtina perfectly
underſtood the meaning of Willoughby's
letter, which ran thus:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>The only apology, dear Celeſtina, that
the unhappy Willoughby has to offer for
his conduct is, to relate to you all that
has befallen him ſince that fatal night
when he parted from you at Alveſtone.
The emotions which I muſt feel while I
write, I will endeavour to ſuppreſs,
both for your ſake and my own; it ſhall
be, if I can command myſelf, a hiſtory
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0206900203:115"/>
of events rather than of the ſufferings to
which thoſe events have condemned me.
You know, that after the abrupt and
unaccountable note that I received, I
haſtened to the inn at Exeter, where
I was informed ſome perſons, who had
buſineſs of the utmoſt importance which
admitted not of a moment's delay,
waited to ſee me. The terms in which
the note was written were ſuch as gave
me a ſtrange alarm, though I knew not
what to dread. This uneaſy aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was not leſſened, when, after much
appearance of myſtery, I was introduced
to—Lady Caſtlenorth.</p>
                  <p>You know the woman, and can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how ill her harſhneſs, when irritated
by the malignity of diſappointed pride,
was calculated to ſoften the blow which
it was her pleaſure to give me herſelf.
She told me, that having heard I was
on the following morning to become
your huſband, ſhe felt it to be her duty
to ſave me from the horrors of ſuch a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0206900203:116"/>
union, by informing me that ſhe knew
you to be the daughter of my mother,
the daughter of that Mr. Everard who
was my tutor, and that the woman ſhe
had with her, who had been a ſervant
in the houſe at the time, could give the
moſt indiſputable account of your birth.</p>
                  <p>Stunned as by a ſtroke of thunder, I
turned towards the woman, of whoſe
face as a ſervant of my mother's I had
not the leaſt recollection. I know not
what I ſaid to her; I only remember
that ſhe gave, in a confuſed and vulgar
way, an account of what ſhe pretended
to have been witneſs to. I ſuffered her
to talk on, for my very ſoul was ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with anguiſh. My mother's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
deſtroyed! my Celeſtina torn from
me! My ſoul recoiled from the idea as
from an execrable falſhood. Yet when
I remembered the ſolemn injunction
that beloved mother gave me in her
laſt moments to marry Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the promiſe ſhe drew from me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0206900203:117"/>
otherwiſe to unite myſelf—when
my agonized mind ran back to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
ſhe ſometimes expreſſed at my
fondneſs and admiration for you—I
dared not, with all the pain and all the
horror I felt, I dared not throw from me
with indignation this odious intelligence;
I dared not load the hateful communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators
of it with the odium which would
have been dictated by my ſwelling heart,
had it not been checked by theſe ſad
recollections, which preſſed upon me
in deſpite of myſelf, and gave me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like internal evidence of the facts
I would very fain have denied.</p>
                  <p>There was, in the countenance of
Lady Caſtlenorth, ſomething of inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
triumph which I could not bear.
She made a merit of her diſintereſted
conduct, and talked of virtue, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and integrity, till I was blind and
deaf: ſhe then threw out ſome reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on my mother's memory, which
rouſed me from the torpor of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0206900203:118"/>
and ſorrow to reſentment; ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
ſome malignant ſarcaſms againſt
you, and I flew from her.</p>
                  <p>She had, however, completely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
her purpoſe, if it was that of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
me the moſt wretched of human
beings; and in quitting the houſe,
which ſhe did ſoon afterwards, had the
barbarous pleaſure of knowing that ſhe
had deſtroyed my peace for ſome time—if
not for ever.</p>
                  <p>To return to you, Celeſtina, under
the doubts which diſtracted me was
impoſſible. To become your huſband—ſo
lately the fondeſt, the firſt wiſh of a
heart that doated upon you, was not
to be thought of, while ideas of ſo much
horror obtruded themſelves on my mind:
yet to leave you without accounting for
my abſence, to leave you to all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
ſuſpenſe of vague conjectures, to
leave you to ſuppoſe I had deceived
and forſaken you, was cruel, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable:
it was, however, what,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0206900203:119"/>
after a long and dreadful ſtruggle, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to do. I might, indeed, have
put an end to your conjectures by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
you over to others more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting—by
communicating the doubts
Lady Caſtlenorth had raiſed; but this
I found I could leſs bear to do than
even to leave you wholly in ſuſpenſe.
Believing her capable of any thing which
revenge or malice could dictate, there
was reaſon, notwithſtanding all my
trembling apprehenſions, to ſuppoſe it
more than poſſible that ſhe might have
invented the ſtory, and have bribed the
woman with her to give evidence of it's
truth. To this poſſibility my mind
clung with the eagerneſs of a drowning
wretch; and I could not reſolve to ſully
before you the memory of my angel
mother, which I know you hold in ſuch
tender veneration; I could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to raiſe in your delicate and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mind doubts and terrors which
might make ſuch fatal impreſſions as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0206900203:120"/>
might impede our union, even if the
fallacy of this invention to divide us
was detected. In a ſtate of mind then
which I will not attempt to deſcribe, I
at length determined to ſend for Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart,
and without explaining even to
him the motives of my ſudden journey,
to ſecure, if I could, your continuance
at Alveſtone, and to ſet out myſelf to
diſcover the real circumstances of your
birth; and never to return till I had
the moſt thorough convinction that you
were not the daughter of my mother, or
till I could learn to conſider you, if it
were ſo—only as a beloved ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Ah! Celeſtina! I little knew the taſk
I undertook; yet with anguiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
to which no words can do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
I ſet about it. My firſt ſtep was,
to find out Watſon, my mother's old
ſervant, who had never, I knew, left
her for many years. I knew that after
her death, and on receiving the legacy
of fifty pounds that her miſtreſs left her,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0206900203:121"/>
ſhe had retired to the houſe of her ſon,
who was married and ſettled at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven.
I might have written to have
enquired after her; but then I muſt
have waited ſome days in ſuſpenſe I
could not bear; and while I was in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I felt my miſery leſs, from an idea
that I was doing ſomething to end it.
I ſat out therefore on horſeback for
Whitehaven, and on my arrival there
learned that ſhe had been dead about
ſix weeks. This firſt hope of certainty
thus fruſtrated, it occurred to me that
perhaps among her papers there might
be ſome memorandums that would be
uſeful; and as she always hired and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the inferior ſervants, and kept
an account of the time and terms of their
ſervice in a book, I flattered myſelf that
I might find ſome date of the time
when Hannah Biſcoe, who pretended
to have been in her confidence and to
have been entruſted with a ſecret of ſuch
importance, really lived in the family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0206900203:122"/>
I told her ſon, that to ſee all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
his mother had left, was of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to me. He readily brought all
he had. There were ſome books of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and ſome memorandums about
ſervants, but none that gave me any
light, or were of any importance to my
enquiry, for none went back above ten
years. The man told me there were
more; but that not knowing they were
of any conſequence, or even ſuppoſing
them likely to be called for, he had
given them to his children, who had cut
them to pieces. "I believe, however,
Sir, ſaid he, that there are ſome letters
in a drawer of a bureau, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to have ſeen during my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
illneſs: I will fetch them if you
think they will be of any ſervice."</p>
                  <p>I deſired him to do ſo, and he brought
me about twenty letters: ſome of them
were from my mother, while ſhe was in
London in the years 1779 and 1780,
and Watſon was at Alveſtone with you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0206900203:123"/>
and my ſiſter, of whom ſhe had, as you
well remember, the care on all occaſions
where it was neceſſary for my mother to
be abſent. You were then about nine,
and Matilda about eleven years old.
The only ſentences of any kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
were theſe:</p>
                  <p>I have no notion of any real danger
from the landing of troops from the fleets
of France and Spain. No landing can
take place; and 'tis all nonſenſe and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado.
I thought you had more ſenſe,
Watſon, than to catch the panic of the
vulgar and the ignorant, which <hi>they</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like to communicate. However,
ſince you write ſo preſſingly to know
what ſhould be done if any thing ſhould
happen, I give you an anſwer, firſt, that
nothing will happen; and ſecondly, if
you have any alarm, which a reaſonable
being would conſider ſuch, take <hi>my</hi> two
girls and bring them up hither inſtantly.
But I ſhall be down at Alveſtone in about
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0206900203:124"/>
ten days, and nothing can happen within
that time believe me</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My two girls,</hi> was the only ſentence in
this letter on which I could lay any
ſtreſs. <hi>My</hi> two girls! Well, and what
then? have I not heard my mother a
thouſand times ſay, <hi>my</hi> two girls? <hi>My
Matilda, my Celeſtina,</hi> were names in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately
uſed: my <hi>children;</hi> even
my <hi>daughters,</hi> were terms not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
with her. Ah! little, little did
her generous and benevolent heart ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that <hi>ſuch</hi> advantage might be taken
of that generoſity—of that benevolence;
for now—even now—no—I do not, I
cannot, I will not believe that Celeſtina
has any other claim to her friendſhip, to
her protection, than what aroſe from
that generoſity and benevolence. Now,
do I ſay?—can I ſay it? Oh heaven!
how dreadfully contradictory are the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
that agitate and tear my heart!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0206900203:125"/>
Let me, however, recall my ſcattered
thoughts: and remember, that it is a
ſimple hiſtory of facts only, and not of
feelings, that I promiſed to relate.</p>
                  <p>Another letter was written to Watſon,
when Mr. Everard, after a very tedious
illneſs, which had long confined him in
town, went down to Alveſtone in the
year eighty, for change of air, rather
than to his own parſonage, where ſome
repairs were then going on. This letter
was expreſſive of great ſolicitude and
anxiety: but from thence what could be
inferred? nothing but that the dear and
benevolent writer was ſolicitous for the
health of a friend to whom ſhe had long
been attached. There was not in this a
word on which the moſt invidious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver
could dwell; nor was there in
any other letter a ſyllable to give me
any confirmation of what I dreaded to
find. Still I procured from the perſon
who had ſucceeded to Watſon's effects,
every paper and every book that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0206900203:126"/>
but I found nothing; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to London as miſerable, as diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
as I left it.</p>
                  <p>Nothing made me more wretched
than the queſtions with which I was now
perſecuted. I fled from ſociety; ſtopped
at a ſmall village in the neighbourhood
of London, where I avoided every body
who was likely to know me, and thought
only how I might ſatisfy my own tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
doubts, and eſcape thoſe of others.</p>
                  <p>The moſt obvious method ſeemed to
be, to find out the woman who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
Lady Caſtlenorth, and queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
her when ſhe was no longer under
the influence of her employer: but this
I could not do without getting, at my
uncle's houſe, information which I
knew not how to ſet about. To go
there, was hateful to me. I could not
now bear the ſight of people whom I
had never loved, and to whom I imputed
all the miſery I laboured under.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0206900203:127"/>
My ſervant Farnham had been little
uſed to thoſe ſort of negociations, and
knew not much better than I did, how
to ingratiate himſelf into the favour of
the perſons, through whoſe means only
he could procure the intelligence ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to us. He went, however, about
it as well as he could; but all I learned
was, that Lady Caſtlenorth had, ſoon
after her journey into Devonſhire, ſent
the woman who accompanied her away
into her native country, which was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Norfolk or Suffolk, and with ſo
much ſecrecy that nobody knew whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe was gone, or how ſhe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for: but Farnham with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
drew from the reſt of the ſervants,
with whom he found means of converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that ſhe had boaſted, in ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of vulgar exultation, that her
fortune was made for ever.</p>
                  <p>No clue, however, could I obtain by
which I could find out this woman; and
after much fruitleſs enquiry, where the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0206900203:128"/>
art of the adverſary with whom I had
to engage baffled all my aſſiduity, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to go to Lord Caſtlenorth, to
ſtate to him the ſtigma that his wife had
thrown on the honour of my mother,
his ſiſter, and to demand that I might
have proofs of the facts ſhe alledged,
ſuch as ſhe could now give, or that ſhe
might acknowledge the wickedneſs and
injuſtice of her aſperſions.</p>
                  <p>I was not aware, till I converſed with
Lord Caſtlenorth, to how debilitated a
ſtate indolence, ignorance, pride, and
prejudice, can reduce the human mind.
His, however, was of ſo ſingular a caſt,
that inſtead of being ſhocked at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done to his ſiſter's honour, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to reſent, in ſpite of his family
pride, my doubts of his wife's veracity,
flew from the point to which I attempted
to bring him, and we parted in mutual
diſguſt: at leaſt I was diſguſted, and
more wretched and more hopeleſs than
before I had made this attempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0206900203:129"/>
Every effort to diſcover the retreat of
the woman failing, my next meaſure
was to go to the convent at Hieres. It
was owing to theſe cruel circumſtances,
Celeſtina, that I left you in doubt while
I remained in England; it was owing
to theſe, that I left England in the
hope—though it became every day more
mingled with apprehenſion—that I left
England without accounting to you for
my conduct. Were theſe ſurmiſes
groundleſs, why ſhould I empoiſon your
delicate mind? why ſhould I ſully for
a moment the ſacred fame of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by divulging them? were they
found to be at length too well ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
it would be then time enough to
inform you of them.</p>
                  <p>On my arrival at Hieres, I went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the preſent Confeſſor of the
community out of whoſe care my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
took you. I found him to be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
obliging, and officious. From
him I learned, that the preſent Superior
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0206900203:130"/>
was a young woman of good family,
who had been compelled to take the veil,
and who would probably have very few
real ſcruples as to giving me all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ſhe could.</p>
                  <p>I ſucceeded eaſily in my reſearch, as
far as it depended on theſe two perſons.
I found that the memorandum of my
mother's having taken you out of the
convent, by the name of Celeſtina de
Mornay, remained; and I found, with
emotions on which I muſt not dwell,
that there was another memorandum of
expences, for the little <hi>Engliſh</hi> child,
received at the requeſt of Madame de
P—. Such is the literal ſenſe of the
French words. Who then was this
Madame de P—? An old nun, who
had lived in the houſe above five and
twenty years, and who was the only
perſon who recollected any circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of your reception, told me that ſhe
well remembered that this Madame de
P—came from Bayonne, or ſome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0206900203:131"/>
part of the country in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of that town; and that ſhe was an
intimate friend of the then Abbeſs, and
her name, of which only the initials
were expreſſed in the memorandum,
was le Marquiſe de Pellatier.</p>
                  <p>I enquired of the old nun, if ſhe
knew on what ground it was you were
repreſented as an Engliſh child? ſhe
replied, that ſhe knew no more than
that when firſt you were received under
the care of the Superior, you were ſaid
to be the child of Engliſh parents, or at
leaſt that one of your parents was of that
nation: but that ſoon afterwards this
was, by the Abbeſs's authority, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted;
it was forbidden to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the community; and it was
ordered that you ſhould from that time
be ſpoken of as Mademoiſelle de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay;
while intimations were given that
you were a relation of her own; born of
a concealed marriage; and that your
father being dead, and your mother
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0206900203:132"/>
married to another perſon, you were to
be conſidered as belonging only to the
community in which you were deſtined
to paſs your life.</p>
                  <p>Ah! Celeſtina! what food was here
for thoſe corroſive conjectures which
preyed on my heart. Having exhauſted
however, every kind of information
which it was here poſſible to procure, I
ſet out for Bayonne; where ſome of the
family at leaſt of Madame de Pellatier
were, I underſtood, to be found.</p>
                  <p>She had herſelf been dead ſome years.
I met, however, with her ſon, a gay
young man of four or five and twenty,
from whom I could obtain nothing but
a general confeſſion that his mother
probably had, from the general tenor of
her life, occaſion in more than one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to exerciſe the ſecrecy and kind
offices of her friends, and very probably
obliged them in her turn: and when I
explained to him my reaſons for the
anxious enquiries I made, which I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0206900203:133"/>
thought the only means likely to intereſt
him for me, he ſaid that he was "<hi>vrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
au deſeſpoir</hi>" at the little <hi>embarras</hi>
into which I had fallen: that la belle
demoiſelle might be my ſiſter or might
be his; that he had not the leaſt hope
of being of ſervice to me in unravelling
the myſtery, for he had deſtroyed all
his mother's papers in purſuance of her
dying directions ſome years before, and
did not believe the ſlighteſt trace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
of any connection with an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
lady, or an Engliſh family. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
where his mother lived in the
years 1770 and 1771, which was about
the time of your birth, and where in the
year 1772, the time of your reception in
the convent; he replied that ſhe was
then ſometimes at Paris, where ſhe was
believed to have an arrangement with
Count W—, a German nobleman,
ſometimes at Pezenas and ſometimes
at Hieres. From all this I could gather
nothing to my purpoſe; and Monſieur
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0206900203:134"/>
de Pellatier ſoon quitting his houſe in
the neighbourhood of Bayonne to go to
Paris, I returned thither alſo, infinitely
more unhappy than before my reſearch.</p>
                  <p>All I have related, Celeſtina, is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
convincing when it is put together,
that perhaps I ought not to lay any ſtreſs
upon it, when to ſuch ſlight and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
ground of conjecture, is oppoſed
the character and the principles of my
mother: yet ſhall I tell you truly, that
the energy with which ſhe preſſed me
with her laſt words to marry Miſs Fitz-Hayman;
the diſpleaſure ſhe always
ſhewed at my expreſſing any partiality
towards you; her grief at the death of
Mr. Everard, which it was eaſy to ſee
ſhe never recovered; ſome words which,
though I could not clearly underſtand
them, eſcaped her lips almoſt with her
laſt ſigh, and in which the name of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
ſeemed united with ſome ardent
prayer, or ſome earneſt injunction,
while, in her cold convulſed hand, ſhe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0206900203:135"/>
preſſed mine to her trembling lips; oh!
Celeſtina! thoſe ſounds I have ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
into a confeſſion of this fatal
ſecret. Still, ſtill inarticulate as they
were, they vibrate on my heart: and
now, united with the ſtory of Lady Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenorth,
and the circumſtances I have
gathered of your being born of Engliſh
parents—all, all unite to render me
wretched.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is not the leaſt likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and my mother; there is not
the remoteſt reſemblance between you
and Mr. Everard, who had remarkably
ſtrong features and very red hair: oh!
Celeſtina! what am I to conjecture?
what am I to do? can I, ought I, on
ſuch grounds, to reſign you? Can I ever
learn to conſider you only as my ſiſter?
Where ſhall I go next? how ſatisfy my
doubts? how ever poſſeſs again a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
happineſs? Every other evil is light to this. Even
the diſorder of my affairs, the neceſſity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0206900203:136"/>
I ſhall ſoon be in to ſell Alveſtone, is
hardly felt. On my leaving England,
I raiſed money at an enormous premium
in order to pay Vavaſour what I could
not bear to owe him, uncertain as I was
what would become of me. This, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with my abſence; has alarmed
ſome of my mortgagees, who talk of
forecloſing their mortgages; while my
own neglect of my affairs has, in deſpite
of Cathcart's aſſiduity, contributed to
my embarraſſments. But what are theſe
inferior diſtreſſes, compared to the
wretchedneſs of a heart, adoring Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
yet afraid of indulging his paſſion
leſt it lead him into guilt? Ah! every
evil fortune could inflict but this, I could
bear.</p>
                  <p>But again it is neceſſary to recall my
pen from the deſcription of feelings to the
narrative of facts.</p>
                  <p>Lord and Lady Caſtlenorth and their
daughetr arrived in the early part of the
ſummer in France. I was then abſent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0206900203:137"/>
on the reſearch I have related to you,
but heard they had been very earneſt in
their enquiries after me at Paris; and on
my return thither, ſome months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
I received a letter from Lord
Caſtlenorth, earneſtly deſiring me to
join them at Florence or Naples. The
letter imported that the alliance he once
wiſhed was no longer in queſtion; but
that finding his health every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
he wiſhed to ſee the only male
relation he had, on the ſettlement of
ſome family concerns.</p>
                  <p>This invitation I ought not perhaps
on other accounts to have refuſed; but
the hope of being able to gain ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intelligence of the circumſtances
which occupied my mind inceſſantly,
determined me at once to accept it.
I went then, and met them at Florence,
where my uncle received me with as
much overacted civility, as when we
parted laſt he had treated me with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious
ſcorn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0206900203:138"/>
I found him, however, not more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
than before : the prejudices that
had taken poſſeſſion of his mind were ſo
ſtrong that he was angry and amazed
that what made the whole buſineſs of
his life could be to any other perſon
matters of mere indifference. He talked
to me inceſſantly of remedies for the
gout, of the medicines he was taking,
and of their effects; told me how he
ſlept and how he eat; and read diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
without end on chronic diſorders
in general; and from this diſcourſe he
glided by ſome link which eſcaped
me, into his other favourite ſcience, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry.
Oh! the quarterings and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which I was compelled to affect
hearing; the genealogies I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with; and the marriages and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarriages
to which I appeared to liſten,
while in fact I knew nothing of what he
ſaid, and only endured this ſort of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
in the hope of ſeeing Lady Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenorth,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0206900203:139"/>
who on my firſt viſits did not
deign to appear.</p>
                  <p>All theſe latter harangues were, I
found, intended to impreſs on my mind
the pride and prudence which would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a union with my couſin, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the advantage it would give me
above any other alliance I could form.
My patient acquieſcence was imputed to
returning inclination for this boaſted
connection; and when I was thought to
be ſufficiently impreſſed with the ideas
thus meant to be conveyed to me, and
to be weaned from the weakneſs I had
betrayed, I was admitted, without any
ſolicitation however on my part, to the
honour of ſeeing Lady Caſtlenorth and
her daughter.</p>
                  <p>The elder lady was the only one of
them with whom I wiſhed to have any
converſation, and her love of hearing
herſelf talk obtained me this favour, in
ſpite of all the diſpleaſure ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
againſt me: but it was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0206900203:140"/>
to bring her to converſe on that
ſubject which alone intereſted me: ſhe
would talk politics, or give me a diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on the nature of the ſoul, or on
the eruptions of Veſuvius, deſcant on
the age of the world, or on her <hi>own</hi>
age,(if her auditors would allow her to
be not quite five and forty:) but of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
ſhe would <hi>not</hi> talk; and if ever I,
in ſpite of her evaſions, introduced the
converſation, ſhe affected to hear me
with horror, and to conſider every men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I made of a perſon whom ſhe called
ſo connected with me, as the moſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
and improper converſation with
which I could entertain her. She was
for the moſt part ſurrounded, when I
was admitted to her, with abbati, and
the oracle of a circle ſhe had herſelf
formed, in which it was generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
to entertain her with any
other converſation than that ſhe choſe to
lead to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0206900203:141"/>
Her daughter, who had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me with ſo much haughtineſs,
and who had ſince been offended in the
tendereſt point, a point too in which
her extreme vanity had rendered her
particularly ſuſceptible, affected no
longer the overweening pride which in
our firſt interviews had been ſo repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
but a ſoft melancholy, which ſits
well enough on ſome people, but was
in her more likely to move mirth than
pity: ſhe ſeldom ſpoke to me; but when
ſhe did, it was with the air of one whoſe
juſt indignation was conquered by
ſofter ſentiments. I knew I never could
deſerve thoſe ſentiments from her, and
therefore was very ſorry to ſee them, even
though certain they were feigned.</p>
                  <p>But it was here only I could hope to
gain any information of the woman,
Hannah Biſcoe, who pretended to have
lived with my mother near twenty years
ſince. Lady Caſtlenorth evaded, with
wonderful art, ever giving me any trace
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0206900203:142"/>
of this circumſtance, and of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I knew it was in vain to enquire;
but there was a little ſmart Italian girl,
called Juſtina, who had attended on
Miſs Fitz-Hayman for ſome time, and
who had been in England with her, and
I took occaſion, as often as I could ſee
her, to ſay ſome obliging thing to her,
and ſometimes to make her a trifling
preſent. Juſtina, in conſequence of my
taking ſo much notice of her, began
officiouſly to put herſelf in my way;
and I believe her vanity prompted her
for ſome time to ſuppoſe I had very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
motives for my attention than thoſe
with which I was really actuated.</p>
                  <p>But in a foreign woman of that rank
even vanity uſually yields to avarice.
When I had obtained an opportunity of
clearly explaining myſelf, Juſtina un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to procure me a direction to the
woman whom I was ſo ſolicitous to
find. She produced it in about a week,
but artfully evaded my queſtion as to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0206900203:143"/>
how ſhe came by it. I ſent off my own
ſervant inſtantly with it, determined to
follow him myſelf if the information as
to her place of abode proved to be true.
I received an account from him that a
few days before his arrival at the houſe
in Suffolk, where ſhe was ſaid to live,
ſhe had removed from thence, and the
people either did not know or would
not tell whither ſhe was gone.</p>
                  <p>This ſeemed ſo like an artifice of
Lady Caſtlenorth's to prevent my mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the enquiry which ſhe knew I had
ſo long and ſo earneſtly deſired, that I
could now no longer doubt but that
Juſtina had betrayed me: but during
this diſquieting ſuſpenſe time wore away,
and you, Celeſtina—what did you, what
could you think of me?</p>
                  <p>I entertained the ſtrongeſt hopes, that
ſince Lady Caſtlenorth ſo induſtriouſly
kept me from the perſon ſhe had herſelf
produced as likely to give me authentic
and indiſputable teſtimony, that ſhe knew
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0206900203:144"/>
her evidence would not bear inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to this hope I eagerly adhered.
My mind, however, was too much irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the idea of ſuch complicated
treachery to allow me to keep terms
with her as I had hitherto done: I was
wandering about Italy all the time of
Farnham's abſence: on his rejoining me,
I went back to the reſidence of Lord
Caſtlenorth, and very peremptorily
taxed his wife with fraud. I denied
that Hannah Biſcoe lived with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the period ſhe pretended to have
done ſo; and that leaſt I ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the deception, that ſhe had been
ſent away from the place where I had
with difficulty diſcovered her.</p>
                  <p>Lady Caſtlenorth affected the calm
indifference of injured innocence, the
proud conſciouſneſs of ill treated inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
ſhe affected to declare that ſhe
was deſirous of my ſeeing this Hannah
Biſcoe, that ſhe knew not of her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the place whither ſhe went,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0206900203:145"/>
which was the houſe of a brother in law,
nor was in any way concerned about her;
"but," added ſhe, riſing and going to a
cabinet where ſhe kept papers; "you
ſhall preſently be convinced that ſhe did
live with your mother in the year 1770."</p>
                  <p>She took out a letter, which I ſaw
immediately to be my mother's hand.
It was directed to Hannah Biſcoe at
Mrs. Willoughby's, South Audley-ſtreet,
where my mother's town houſe then
was. Theſe were the words:</p>

                  <p>I returned the letter to Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,
and expreſſed myſelf very warmly;
inſiſting upon it that from ſuch evidence
nothing could be derived or even
gueſſed at: but ſhe bade me, with a
contemptuous ſmile, remember, that
when I queſtioned this woman at Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe had told me, that you were for
the firſt months of your life nurſed at
Kenſington, whither ſhe went almoſt
every day to ſee you, and that at five
or ſix months old you were ſent abroad;
and when my mother went to the South
of France, on pretence of recovering
her health, eighteen or twenty months
after the death of my father, you were
conveyed thither, and there put under
the care of a friend, who placed you
ſoon after with the Superior of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of St. Celeſtine, at Hieres, as a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her own.</p>
                  <p>The coincidence of this ſtory, with
what I had heard before relative to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Pellatier, ſtruck me with more force
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0206900203:147"/>
than any thing I had yet learned. I
left the houſe of Lord Caſtlenorth more
miſerable than I had ever been before,
and again ſet out for Provence, hardly
knowing why, and not caring at all
what became of me.</p>
                  <p>Ever ſince that period, Celeſtina, I
have been wandering from place to place
in ſearch of information which I cannot
obtain, and, which obtained, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
render me wretched, if indeed
any wretchedneſs can be greater than
that which in my preſent ſtate of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
uncertainty it is my lot to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Are we then, Celeſtina, are we related
by blood? and is there an invincible
bar between us? Was my mother, that
admirable, that excellent, and almoſt
faultleſs woman, capable of living in a
ſtate of continual diſſimulation as to
you, and of hiding one fault by another,
which might have been followed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
ſo hideous to my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Oh! Celeſtina, it ſeems ſacrilege
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0206900203:148"/>
to her memory to think it: yet her
averſion to my expreſſions of tenderneſs
towards you, her conduct in a hundred
inſtances I can recollect, her ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
the promiſe ſhe extorted from
me to marry Miſs Fitz-Hayman—a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
urged with ſuch vehemence, even
in her laſt moments! Could the poor
conſideration of pecuniary advantage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
her then? did it ever influence
her? And the repetition of your name
with her laſt breath, mingled with words
that might be a prayer for you, but
which I have ſince thought was poſſibly
the fatal ſecret which ſhe determined to
divulge only in death. The ſad recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of that ſcene, her countenance,
which I continually behold, her voice,
which murmurs ſtill in my ears, all, all
contribute to empoiſon every moment
of my life, and to make that tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that ardent love, which was
once the joy of my exiſtence and the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0206900203:149"/>

with which heaven can purſue me.</p>
                  <p>Yes, Celeſtina, unleſs I dared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
that fondneſs with which my
heart overflows, I would I could forget
you for ever, and determine never to ſee
you more, for I deſpair of ever ſeeing
you as I—Pardon me, I am loſt in
the confuſion of ſenſations I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe;
and at this moment I hope ſo
miſerable a being does not exiſt on this
earth. Write to me, Celeſtina: you

paſſions. Write to me; tell me
what you would have me do farther to
unveil this ſad myſtery, or to throw it
from us for ever, if that may be. I

impoſſible longer to conceal from him:
he is warmly my friend, and you may

ſhe wept not now: ſhe read the letter over

but her ſtunned ſenſes had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their tone. It was late; it was

to undreſs herſelf, threw herſelf on the

what ſhe had read, on Willoughby's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>She ordered him to be told, that ſhe was
not very well, and could not immediately
attend him: then ſhaking off the heavy
laſſitude which uneaſineſs and want of reſt
had occaſioned, ſhe called to her aid all
that ſtrength of mind and rectitude of heart
with which ſhe was eminently endowed by
nature; and having again read over Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
letter, began to conſider what ſhe
ought to do.</p>
            <p>With a doubt of ſuch a nature on his
mind, ſhe reſolved, whatever it coſt her,
never to meet him but as his ſiſter; unleſs,
which was very improbable, the ſtrong and
bewildering circumſtances which had given
riſe to ſuch an idea could all be removed.
With ſo much purity did ſhe love him,
that ſhe felt, that were he happy with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his eſteem and tenderneſs for her
undiminiſhed, ſhe could be content through
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0206900203:153"/>
life to find her felicity in witneſſing his.
She reſolved, therefore, after much debate
with herſelf and ſome pangs of unavoidable
regret, that ſince this dark and unpaſſable
barrier was raiſed, either by nature or by
artifice, between her and the only man ſhe
had ever thought of with fond partiality,
ſhe would never marry, but would leave
him at full liberty to compleat that union
with Miſs Fitz-Hayman, which might at
once fulfil his engagement to his mother,
wean him from that lingering fondneſs
for her which it was folly if not guilt to
indulge, and retrieve his pecuniary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
from thoſe embarraſſments which were
now haſtening to overwhelm him.</p>
            <p>Having formed this heroic and proper
determination, ſhe endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her countenance, to quiet the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her mind, and to meet Vavaſour
with that degree of calm ſpirit which ſhe
imagined, from paſt experience of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
ſuch a meeting would require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0206900203:154"/>
This, however, was eaſier to imagine
than to execute. She wiſhed indeed to
meet him without witneſſes, becauſe ſhe
knew he poſſeſſed too little of that delicacy
which would teach him, to repreſs any
part of his knowledge before ſtrangers, as
Mrs. Elphinſtone and Montague Thorold
were to him: but when ſhe opened the
door of the room where ſhe knew he waited
for her, the blood forſook her cheeks, her
trembling hands refuſed the little exertion
neceſſary to turn the lock, her feet refuſed
to carry her forward, and ſhe would have
returned without ſpeaking to him for that
time, if he, who was eagerly waiting her
approach, had not heard her light foot ſteps
in the paſſage, and opened the door while
ſhe yet ſtood heſitating at it.</p>
            <p>He was ſtruck by the fight of her ſwollen
and heavy eyes, the languor of her air, and
the paleneſs of her countenance; and his
uſual addreſs, which had more of warmth
and vivacity than elegance, was ſoftened
by the real concern of which he was at that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0206900203:155"/>
moment ſenſible. He took her hand,
which trembled within his as he led her to
a feat—"I am ſorry," ſaid he, "to ſee that
you are not well."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina tried to ſpeak, but could not.
Vavaſour had but an indifferent notion of
adminiſtering conſolation, nor could he
contrive to condole with her for what he
ſecretly rejoiced at himſelf; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his diſſembled concern and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled
ſatisfaction, he ſat a moment or
two ſilent; and then remarked, that the
letter he had brought gave a very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of George's health.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, without having any very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
idea of what ſhe ſaid, anſwered faintly,
yes; and by this time Vavaſour added,
that it contained alſo, he ſuppoſed, like what
he had at the ſametime received, the hiſtory
of a deviliſh awkward, myſterious buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who found herſelf unequal to
the converſation, thought it better to put
an end to it at once and for ever. She
therefore, by an effort of reſolution, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0206900203:156"/>
voice enough to ſay—"Mr. Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
you underſtand undoubtedly that
every idea of the alliance between your
friend and me, is at an end for ever. As
for the reaſons that exiſt againſt it, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
motives make me wiſh they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſecret; from this moment, therefore,
you will very much oblige me, by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſpeak of Mr. Willoughby otherwiſe
than as my beſt friend, and by concealing
from the world a ſecret, in which it can
have no intereſt, but which will give pain
to many to have divulged."</p>
            <p>"Divulged!" cried he, laughing:
"what then do you ſuppoſe it is any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret?"</p>
            <p>"To be ſure I do," ſhe replied.</p>
            <p>"Oh! yes," anſwered he, "that is
mighty likely, when Lady Caſtlenorth has
taken ſuch pains to talk of it every where
already."</p>
            <p>"Lady Caſtlenorth!" cried Celeſtina;
a faint bluſh riſing in her pale cheek.</p>
            <p>"Aye, to be ſure," ſaid Vavaſour care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly,
"that ſhe did months ago. Why
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0206900203:157"/>
don't you know, that beſides the intereſt ſhe
had in dividing you and Willoughby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
her daughter is in love with him it
ſeems, ſhe always hated his mother; and
that death itſelf is no barrier againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
like her's."</p>
            <p>"Do you think it probable or poſſible
that this ſtory may be entirely the effect of
that malice."</p>
            <p>"Why faith no. I own I do not. You
know—at leaſt people tell me ſo who
do know, that it was whiſpered about a
great many years ago, and even ſaid, that
Everard was privately married to Mrs.
Willoughby. But what ſignifies talking
about it," added he, "ſeeing her again
change colour—"You have juſt been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
me to ſay nothing about it. George
ſeems to me to have made up his mind
about it: he will marry his couſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
his eſtates, as was his firſt plan; and
my fair Celeſtina" (and he took her hand)
"will look out for ſomebody elſe to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thoſe affections to that he reſigns."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0206900203:158"/>
"No, Sir," ſaid Celeſtina, withdrawing
her hand haſtily from him, "they are not,
I aſſure you, ſo eaſily transferred."</p>
            <p>"I am glad to hear it," replied Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
without being at all diſcompoſed by
her manner; "for then I hope this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantic
young fellow, whom I find here
travelling with you, will not have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
to ſuppoſe <hi>he</hi> has any chance of
obtaining them? Pray tell me—how
comes he here with you? is he any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people you are with?"</p>
            <p>This was a queſtion it was impoſſible for
Celeſtina to anſwer ingenuouſly. The
piercing and enquiring eyes of Vavaſour,
inflamed and fierce from the late hours and
free uſe of wine the preceding night, were
fixed on her face. She changed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
felt that ſhe did, and again her
complexion altered. The various emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with which ſhe was agitated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
that ſhe muſt no longer think of
Willoughby as a lover, yet could never
admit another to that diſtinction, conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0206900203:159"/>
too that Montague Thorold muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the eyes of the world to have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to that place, and anger that Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
ſhould thus preſume on the confidence
of Willoughby to queſtion her with a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he had otherwiſe no pretenſions to, all
combined to affect, to diſtreſs, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
her for a few moments of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of mind, which, from the ſtrength
and clearneſs of her underſtanding, was
uſually at her command.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, who, from the time he found
Willoughby muſt in all probability reſign
her, made no doubt of ſucceeding to her
affections; who had no idea of the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which preſſed on her heart, from his
total inability to feel them himſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
irritated and impatient at the ſilence
his own impetuoſity had occaſioned. He
ſat eagerly reading on her countenance the
emotions of her heart, and interpreting
them his own way: again he repeated his
queſtion—"How came young Thorold
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0206900203:160"/>
with you? Is he related to theſe Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone's?"</p>
            <p>"You muſt enquire of him," Celeſtina
was on the point of ſaying; but the fear
leaſt a quarrel between them ſhould be the
conſequence of her ſo anſwering, checked
her. She tried, therefore, to evade the
queſtion. "Of what concern is it," ſaid
ſhe, "<hi>how</hi> he came hither. We were
talking of Mr. Willoughby. Pray tell
me—is he aware that our ſuppoſed relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is talked of? Does he know the pains
Lady Caſtlenorth has been at to circulate
the ſtory?"</p>
            <p>"'Tis impoſſible for me to know that,"
ſaid Vavaſour, (as it really was;) "it is
much more in your way to tell me, how
this college boy came hither with you."</p>
            <p>"I know no right you have to enquire
about it," anſwered Celeſtina faintly, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I cannot ſee that it is a concern in
which you are at all intereſted."</p>
            <p>"You will give me leave then to make
my own concluſions; or rather," added he,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0206900203:161"/>
in a louder voice, on ſeeing Montague
Thorold enter the room, "rather to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
the gentleman himſelf."</p>
            <p>This was exactly what Celeſtina had been
moſt ſolicitous to avoid; the impetuoſity
of Vavaſour, the ſurprize and anger ſhe
ſaw flaſhing from the eyes of Thorold, her
ſleepleſs night and long agitated ſpirits,
the fear of ſhe knew not what conſequences
from theſe two inflammable ſpirits, and her
inability to check or repreſs thoſe over
whom ſhe had no pretence to aſſume any
authority, were together a combination of
cruel circumſtances which might have
overcome a ſtronger mind than her's.
Mrs. Elphinſtone was dejected from ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and languid from recent ſorrow of her
own: to her, therefore, Celeſtina would in
any caſe reluctantly have applied; and now
ſhe could not leave the room to ſeek her
without leaving together two men who
ſeemed ſo highly irritated againſt each
other that the firſt moment of her abſence
would probably bring them to extremities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0206900203:162"/>
To ſpeak to Vavaſour, was to addreſs
the winds or the ſea: ſhe ſaw that he was
hardly ſober, that he was incapable of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for her diſtreſs, or of liſtening to any
thing but his paſſionate impetuoſity: it was
on Thorold alone ſhe had any hopes of
prevailing; but in the moment of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
this hope ſeemed eſcaping her.</p>
            <p>Before ſhe could determine on what to
do, Vavaſour had, in a manner at once
contemptuous and haſty, addreſſed himſelf
to Montague Thorold, and enquired how
it happened that he was at York attending
on Mrs. Elphinſtone and Miſs De Mornay?</p>
            <p>"How it happens, Sir?" ſaid Thorold.
"Is there then any thing ſo very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in it? May I not be at York or at
Canterbury?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," replied Vavaſour, "when you
are Archbiſhop of either; and then you will
be, for aught I know, in your right place;
but at preſent I think you in the wrong
one."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0206900203:163"/>
"What <hi>you</hi> think, Sir," replied Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
"is the laſt thing that ever can be
of any conſequence to me; and if my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are, as I apprehend, of as little to
you, I imagine we can, find ſome pleaſanter
topic than either the one or the other on
which to entertain this lady."</p>
            <p>He then approached Celeſtina, who was,
he ſaw, ready to ſink from her chair; and
ſoftening his voice, ſaid—"You are ill I
am afraid."</p>
            <p>"No," replied ſhe; "but I am alarmed
and uneaſy; and I beg of you," continued
ſhe, lowering her voice, "I beg of you
to keep your temper, let Mr. Vavaſour ſay
what he will."</p>
            <p>"I cannot promiſe that," ſaid he in the
ſame tone; "but I can promiſe never vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to do or ſay any thing that ſhall
give you a moment's pain. Do not be ſo
diſtreſſed, I beſeech you; let me find Mrs.
Elphinſtone. You tremble: you ſeem
ready to faint."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0206900203:164"/>
"I am indeed," replied ſhe, "affected
from numberleſs cauſes. If you will be ſo
good as to call Mrs. Elphinſtone, I will be
much obliged to you."</p>
            <p>Thorold went immediately to obey her;
and Vavaſour approaching her, cried—"I
ſee how it is; that young fellow is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole
you for the loſs of Willoughby. Your
partiality to him I always ſuſpected, and
am now too well convinced of it."</p>
            <p>"Well, Sir," cried Celeſtina, aſſuming
in ſome degree her uſual ſpirit; "and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it to be ſo, I do not really under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by what pretence you call me to an
account for it."</p>
            <p>"By my own long and ardent affection
for you," cried he; "of which, however
you may now chuſe to affect ignorance,
you cannot have been ignorant. I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
it to Willoughby's prior claim, and
to your viſible attachment to him; but I
am not humble enough to withdraw my
pretenſions in favour of ſuch a raw boy as
Montague Thorold."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:0206900203:165"/>
"I am obliged to you, Sir," anſwered
Celeſtina, "for the predilection you avow
in my favour: though it cannot <hi>command</hi>
my affection, it demands my ſincerity; and
I therefore aſſure you, that though I am
now perhaps at liberty, I have no intention
of engaging myſelf again. I ſhall hope to
be allowed to conſider both you and Mr.
Thorold as my friends, while I abſolutely
decline any preference to either."</p>
            <p>The pride of Vavaſour was hurt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
by this ſpeech. Though he was
not perſonally vain, yet he had from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
been ſo accuſtomed to have his own
way, that oppoſition from any quarter was
new and inſupportable to him. Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
and Thorold at this moment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the room, he for once checked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and breakfaſt being ready, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to partake of it, which however he
declined, but told Celeſtina, on retiring,
that he muſt deſire to ſee her again alone in
an hour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:0206900203:166"/>
Celeſtina now attempted to repreſs the
various emotions with which ſhe was agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
and to quiet the throbbings of her
heart. She ſat down to the table, and tried
to eat, but could not; while Montague
Thorold, watching with eager fondneſs
every turn of her countenance, officiouſly
tried to engage her to partake of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
that was before her.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe could, however, ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;
and after a moment's pauſe alone,
her ſcattered and oppreſſed ſenſes were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
enough to bring before her all that
had happened, and tears, which ſhe had
not hitherto been able to ſhed, came to her
relief.</p>
            <p>Her reaſon too, came to her aſſiſtance,
and ſtrengthened the reſolution ſhe had
formed after her firſt peruſal of Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's
letter. But though ſhe was able to
decide on what ſhe ought to do herſelf,
ſhe ſaw many painful circumſtances likely
to be created by the violence of Vavaſour,
and the impoſſibility of prevailing either
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0206900203:167"/>
on him or on Montague Thorold to leave
her and Mrs. Elphinſtone to purſue their
journey with the others; or, what ſhe
would ſtill have preferred, of continuing it
without the attendance of either.</p>
            <p>When the mind is oppreſſed with any
heavy affliction, the leſs ſerious evils which
at other times it can repel or ſubmit to, are
felt with painful impatience. Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
drooping and depreſſed from her
paſt ſufferings and future apprehenſions,
could no longer interpoſe to check the
impetuoſity of two young men, each of
whom thought himſelf at liberty to attend
on Celeſtina: while Celeſtina herſelf, who
never meant to encourage either, and whoſe
heart was ſo recently wounded by the dread
of having loſt that protection on which ſhe
was wont with fondneſs to rely, was yet
more unequal to the exertion which was
neceſſary to part theſe men, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to look upon each other as rivals,
or to keep them within the bounds of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0206900203:168"/>
if they perſiſted in remaining toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Anxious to proceed towards the houſe
of Cathcart, and to put her children under
the care of her brother, while ſhe herſelf
tried to enter on ſome mode of life by which
to procure them a ſubſiſtence, Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
became impatient of any farther
delay; while Celeſtina, though equally
anxious to get forward, trembled at the
thought of a journey, which ſhe foreſaw
would produce a quarrel, and perhaps a
duel, before they had proceeded three
ſtages.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ſhe thought of leaving the
whole party abruptly, and going on as
ſpeedily as poſſible alone: but beſides her
unwillingneſs to leave Mrs. Elphinſtone,
ſhe foreſaw that if ſhe did, this Vavaſour
would follow and overtake her; and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold
would hardly content himſelf with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
her friend, while certain that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour
was with her. After much conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
therefore, nothing ſeemed to remain,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0206900203:169"/>
but to endeavour to prevail on Thorold to
go forward without them; than which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſeemed much more unlikely to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
unleſs it was the ſame attempt on
Vavaſour. She felt, too, a reluctance in
aſking a favour of Thorold, which he
might interpret as encouragement ſhe never
meant to give him; and was afraid that the
aſſurances ſhe muſt make him in regard to
her total indifference towards Vavaſour,
might afford him reaſon to hope, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him ſhe would be leſs inexorable.</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary, however, immediately
to make the eſſay; and therefore ſending
for Mr. Thorold, ſhe with trembling heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
told him, that the letters brought by
Mr. Vavaſour had been deciſive in regard
to ending the intended alliance between her
and Mr. Willoughby. But ſhe had hardly
uttered the word Willoughby, before the
countenance of Montague Thorold was
animated with all the warm hopes to which
this intelligence gave birth. She ſaw it
with concern; and with as much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0206900203:170"/>
as ſhe could, beſought him to attend
to her, while with a faultering voice, and
her tears with difficulty repreſſed, ſhe went
on—"That I ſhall now never be the wife
of Willoughby is certain: but do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand
me; I have determined never
to be the wife of any other perſon. I ſhall
go, for the reſt of the winter, to Lady
Horatia Howard, and afterwards retire to
ſome village as remote as poſſible from
that part of England where I once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to paſs my life. This reſolution is
unalterable. But though I never can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
as you wiſh the favourable ſentiments
with which you have honoured me, my
friendſhip, my gratitude, my eſteem, it is
in your power to ſecure and—"</p>
            <p>"Friendſhip! gratitude! eſteem!"
cried Montague Thorold. "Can I be
content with ſuch cold words: I, who can
never for an inſtant diſengage my thoughts
from you; I, who worſhip your very ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and who cannot bear the thoughts of
quitting you even for a moment! Oh!
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0206900203:171"/>
Celeſtina! if ever the moſt pure and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
love deſerved a return—"</p>
            <p>"Forgive me," cried Celeſtina, "if in
my turn I interrupt you. Do you not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
your ſentiments, or, by an abuſe of
terms, call a tranſient liking by that name
which ought to belong only to that refined
affection of the heart which leads us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the happineſs of another to our own,
and to ſacrifice every inferior conſideration
to the ſublime pleaſure of promoting that
happineſs."</p>
            <p>"Heaven and earth!" cried Thorold
impetuouſly, "and do I not feel that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
in all its purity for you? Would I
not lay down my life to procure you any
real—almoſt any imaginary good."</p>
            <p>"Prove it," interrupted Celeſtina,
"prove it by obliging me in the requeſt I
am going to make: a requeſt in which I
muſt not be refuſed, and which, before I
make it, you muſt abſolutely promiſe to
grant."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0206900203:172"/>
"I promiſe," returned Thorold, who
had at that moment no idea whither her
requeſt tended, "I promiſe to obey you,
even though you deſired my death. If the
ſacrifice I make has any merit in your eyes,
how cheaply would your approbation be
purchaſed even by the loſs of exiſtence."</p>
            <p>"All that is very abſurd and very wild,"
replied Celeſtina. "What I aſk you can
eaſily do, and ought to do without reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance."</p>
            <p>"Name it," cried he, "and ſee how
well I can obey you."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina then told him, that Vavaſour,
fancying his friendſhip with Mr. Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
gave him a right to attend her, meant,
ſhe feared, to go on with her and Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
to London; "And from the
dialogues which have twice paſſed between
you and him," added ſhe, "there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to apprehend that your continuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
may be attended with very unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
conſequences: neither Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
or I have courage to encounter the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0206900203:173"/>
ſort of contention which may ariſe between
you: and to avoid the hazard of it, allow
us to thank you for all the trouble you have
taken for us, and now to bid you adieu till
we meet again in Devonſhire."</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, who from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he underſtood her had liſtened with
impatience, now proteſted that the promiſe
he had juſt given could not be binding in
an inſtance that muſt be as injurious to his
honour as cruel, to his feelings. "Why
ſhould you ſuffer this Mr. Vavaſour," ſaid
he, "to force himſelf upon you, while
you drive me from you? What is this chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
claim that he derives from Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
who has reſigned his own; and
how poor and ſpiritleſs muſt I appear, who
having been permitted that of ſeeing
you thus far on your journey, conſent to
reſign to another the honour of attending
you to the end of it: to another, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
a right no better founded than my
own; and to whom I am to give place
for no other reaſon but becauſe he rudely
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0206900203:174"/>
demands it. You would deſpiſe me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
and I ſhould deſerve to be deſpiſed,
were I capable of ſo mean a deſertion."</p>
            <p>This was exactly what Celeſtina feared;
but perſiſting in her reſolution to eſcape the
alarm to which ſhe muſt be ſubject from
Vavaſour and Montague Thorold's being
together during the journey, ſhe told the
latter very calmly, that unleſs he conſented
to oblige her, and to go forward under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of being obliged to return home,
that their acquaintance muſt here end for
ever.</p>
            <p>Even againſt this, fear, his reluctante to
yield, or to appear, to yield the right of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
her to Vavaſour, awhile ſupported
him. The dread, too, leaft Vavaſour
ſhould now ſucceed for himſelf, and that he
ſhould ſee thoſe hopes deſtroyed for ever
which he ſo fondly cheriſhed ſince Willoughby
was out of the queſtion, made him
reſiſt ſtill more forcibly the injunctions
Celeſtina deſired to lay upon him. At
length, his fear of offending her, his real
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0206900203:175"/>
love for her, and the ſight of her uneaſineſs;
her aſſurances that Vavaſour never would
have any particular intereſt in her favour,
(though at the ſame time ſhe bade him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that he had himſelf no better
claim,) and his wiſh to ſhew her how much
he preferred her ſatisfaction to his own,
prevailed upon him to ſacrifice his pride
and his fears to her entreaties; and making
himſelf acquainted with the place where
ſhe was to be with Mrs. Elphinſtone in
London, where he obtained permiſſion to
attend her as ſoon as ſhe arrived, Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold, though ſtill reluctantly and
with great compulſion on himſelf, departed
alone, and on poſt horſes purſued his way
to London.</p>
            <p>Having thus prevailed on Thorold to
depart, Celeſtina again ſat down to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
her fatigued ſpirits. She had ſome
hours before determined to write to Lady
Horatia Howard, and accept of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
ſo repeatedly offered her, as ſoon as
ſhe ſaw Mrs. Elphinſtone ſafe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0206900203:176"/>
and aſſiſtance of Cathcart, who was
to meet them in London.</p>
            <p>This letter, therefore, ſhe wrote, and
forwarded; and as neither the weather or
any other circumſtance was now likely to
render their progreſs hazardous, Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
agreed that they would ſet out at
a very early hour the next morning.</p>
            <p>The day, however, was of neceſſity to
be ended where they were; and it was
very certain that Vavaſour would paſs it
with them. He had ordered for them
every thing they were likely to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for, in a ſtile infinitely ſuperior to
what they would themſelves have thought
of; and when they met at dinner, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them as his gueſts, and when his
natural vivacity was heightened by that
ſort of triumph that he felt on finding that
Thorold was gone, his exulting ſpirits
were ſuch as to be cruelly oppreſſive both
to Mrs. Elphinſtone and Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>Incapable of entering into <hi>their</hi> feelings,
he had no idea of repreſſing his own. He
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0206900203:177"/>
fancied there no longer exiſted any obſtacle
to his project in regard to Celeſtina; and
as that project had long been the firſt of
his heart, and had become doubly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
from the oppoſition it had met with,
he concealed no part of the pleaſure he felt
at what he fancied the abſolute certainty of
its immediate accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>This was conduct that was inſupportably
diſtreſſing to Celeſtina. He ſpoke without
ſcruple of the reſignation Willoughby had
made of her hand, and ſeemed to have as
little delicacy as to the occaſion of it. Of
an attachment to him, abſtracted from
every idea of becoming his wife, Vavaſour
had no idea; and Celeſtina had no courage
to urge it; ſo entirely did his want of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the proud certainty he ſhewed of
his own ſucceſs, overwhelm her. All ſhe
could do was, to entreat Mrs. Elphinſtone
not to leave her with him, and to aſſiſt her
as much as poſſible in attempting at leaſt
to check that aſſuming manner, for which
neither her former friendſhip for Vavaſour,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0206900203:178"/>
nor the regard Willoughby had for him,
could, in her opinion, offer any apology.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, however, for both her and
her friend, two young men of fortune,
much acquainted with Vavaſour, arrived
at the inn early in the evening, and ſeeing
his ſervants, enquired for him, and were
ſhewn into the room almoſt as ſoon as din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was over. Celeſtina and her friend
took the earlieſt opportunity to withdraw;
and Vavaſour's attention to his gueſts over
their wine, delivered them for the reſt of
the evening from his company.</p>
            <p>He had taken care, however, to inform
himſelf of all that related to their journey
the next day. But eager as he was to have
Celeſtina in the chaiſe with him, he was
compelled to deſiſt from the requeſt he at
firſt ventured to make, on her repreſenting
the impoſſibility of her leaving Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone;
to whom, though Vavaſour
heartily wiſhed her once more in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brides,
he had at length the complaiſance
to offer his place in his own chaiſe, as being
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0206900203:179"/>
more commodious than the hired ones to
be found on the road; and agreed, on her
acquieſcence in that arrangement, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
himſelf in a hack chaiſe with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen who had paſſed the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him at the inn, were not leſs fond
of the pleaſures of the table than he was
himſelf; and their orgies had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
till it was no longer worth while for
him to go to bed. With a very little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of his dreſs therefore, and with a
great deal of wine ſtill in his head, he was
ready in the morning to ſet out: but ſuch
was his appearance, and ſuch his manners
in conſequence of his debauch the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
evening, that Celeſtina was more
than ever ſolicitous to avoid him; and had
it been poſſible for her to have thought of
him before with the ſlighteſt degree of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
his looks and his converſation of
this morning would have filled her with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and diſguſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0206900203:180"/>
As ſhe travelled on, however, by the
ſide of her dejected friend, who had no
ſpirits for converſation, ſhe could not, amid
all the reflection on her own circumſtances,
which filled her mind, avoid conſidering,
with, melancholy regret, the ſituation of
this young man, who, with ſome talents
and many virtues, was thus yielding to the
wild current of paſſion and vice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
his conſtitution and his fortune
before he knew the value of either. She
then with mournful recollection contraſted
his character with that of Willoughby,
who had once all his vivacity, tempered
with ſo much ſweetneſs, ſo much attention
to the feelings of others; who had all his
generoſity of ſpirit and openneſs of heart,
without any of his careleſs diſſipation; and
whoſe brighter talents were not obſcured by
vice, nor degraded by folly; and as all his
virtues, all his amiable qualities were enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated,
her heart felt all the acuteneſs of
ſorrow, in remembering too that under
their influence ſhe had loſt the hope of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0206900203:181"/>
paſſing her life: yet the cruel pain of the
reflection that theſe hopes were now at an
end, was immediately mitigated, when ſhe
conſidered, that this ſhe might perhaps
ſtill do, as his ſiſter and his friend; but her
reaſon, however it began to recover its
tone, could never ſay any thing to her that
for a moment taught her to reflect with
pleaſure, or even with tranquillity, on the
thoughts of his being united to Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hayman.</p>
            <p>On reperuſing Willoughby's letter, which
ſhe had now acquired courage to ſtudy
more minutely, ſhe ſaw with new uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
what in the firſt tumult of her ſpirits
had eſcaped her, or at leaſt made but a
ſlight impreſſion—that he recommended
her particularly to the care and protection
of Vavaſour; and that, as he had probably
intimated the ſame truſt to Vavaſour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſhe ſhould find it very difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
herſelf from his attendance.</p>
            <p>The longer ſhe dwelt on Willoughby's
expreſſions, the more ſhe apprehended he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0206900203:182"/>
was but too well convinced that the whole
ſtory of their relationſhip did not originate
with Lady Caſtlenorth. She foreſaw, that
while even the ſhadow of a doubt remained,
their union never ought to be thought of:
but having nobody with whom ſhe could
properly diſcuſs the various and contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
ideas on this bewildering ſubject that
paſſed through her mind, ſhe looked forward
with earneſt impatience to the hour when
ſhe ſhould receive the maternal counſel and
ſoothing conſolation which Lady Horatia
Howard alone was likely to afford her.</p>
            <p>The journey, however, was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and though ſhe carefully avoided,
during the two days that it laſted, being
alone with Vavaſour, yet ſhe ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
pain from the encreaſing conviction
that he preſumed on Willoughby's total
reſignation of her, and openly declared
that he thought himſelf a candidate for her
favour, whoſe fortune and pretenſions of
every kind rendered him ſecure of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0206900203:183"/>
At length the party reached London,
and Cathcart received his ſiſter and her
friend at the lodgings he had prepared, for
them on being informed of the time of their
arrival.</p>
            <p>The meeting between him and Mrs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinſtone
was too affecting to the already
depreſſed ſpirits of Celeſtina. She retired
early to her own room, having with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
prevailed on Vavaſour to quit her,
and there endeavoured to acquire ſteadineſs
to talk over with Cathcart, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the purport of Willoughby's letter;
and then to take leave of him and her poor
dejected friend, as Lady Horatia Howard
had received with avidity the information
of her intended viſit to her, and was to ſend
her coach for her at one o'clock on the
following day.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="7" type="chapter">
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0206900203:184"/>
            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <p>THE morning at length arrived, and
the friends who had ſo long found all the
conſolation their circumſtances admitted of
in being together, were now to part; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
when, or if ever, they were to meet
again. Mrs. Elphinſtone, ſinking as ſhe
was under oppreſſion of many preſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and future apprehenſions, yet found
them all deepened by the loſs of Celeſtina,
who had ſo generouſly aſſiſted her in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
them: and Celeſtina felt, that
when to ſoothe the ſpirits and ſtrengthen
the reſolution of her friend was no longer
her immediate taſk, ſhe ſhould dwell with
more painful and more ſteady ſolicitude on
her own ſingular and unfortunate ſituation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0206900203:185"/>
Cathcart, warmly attached as he was to
both, from gratitude and from affection,
had no power to ſpeak comfort to either.
Early in the morning he had met Celeſtina,
and gone through Willoughby's letter:
but though his mind ſometimes ſtrongly
reſiſted the idea of that relationſhip of
which it ſpoke, he had nothing to offer
againſt it; and could only ſigh over the
incurable unhappineſs with which he ſaw
the future days of friends he ſo much loved
would be clouded.</p>
            <p>Silently they all aſſembled round the
breakfaſt table; but nobody could eat.
Cathcart tried to talk of Jeſſy, of his houſe,
of his farm, of his fortunate proſpects, and
of his ſiſter's two little girls, whom he had
taken home; but there was not one topic
on which he could ſpeak that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
him of the obligations he owed to
Celeſtina and Willoughby, nor one idea
which aroſe unembittered with the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they, to whom he was indebted
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0206900203:186"/>
for all <hi>his</hi> happineſs, were themſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>
            <p>About twelve o'clock Vavaſour came into
the room in his uſual way; enquired eagerly
of Celeſtina when ſhe went to Lady Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
Howard's, and when he could ſee her
there; and without waiting for an anſwer
to his enquiry, told her that he had that
morning met Sir Philip Molyneux, and
that Lady Molyneux had been in town
about a week. Every body who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to Willoughby was intereſting to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina;
and from Lady Molyneux ſhe had
always ſuppoſed more might be collected
than from any other perſon: but now her
mind was too much oppreſſed and too
much confuſed to allow her to diſtinguiſh
her ſenſations, or to arrange any ſettled
plan for her future conduct towards Lady
Molyneux. She received Vavaſour's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
therefore, with coldneſs; and
indeed her manners towards him were very
conſtrained and diſtant, which he either
did not or would not notice; rattling on in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0206900203:187"/>
his uſual wild way, though he ſaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and concern of the party; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
that more than ever diſguſted Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
who began ſome time before to
doubt whether the credit which Vavaſour
had for good nature was not given him on
very ſlender foundations: for to be ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
occupied by his own pleaſures and
purſuits as to be incapable of the leaſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
towards others, to be unable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to check for one moment his viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in compliment to their deſpondence,
ſeemed to Celeſtina ſuch a want of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as gave her a very indifferent opinion
of his heart.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Elphinſtone quitted the room to
make the laſt preparations for her departure:
but Cathcart, who had fettled every thing
before, remained with Celeſtina and Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.
He would have given the world to
have paſſed theſe moments in converſation
with her; but the preſence of a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and eſpecially of Vavaſour, put an end
to all hope he had of an opportunity of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0206900203:188"/>
explaining to her, with that tenderneſs and
caution which the ſubject required, ſome
circumſtances relative to Willoughby's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which had lately come to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
New embarraſſments ſeemed threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
him; and a law ſuit, involving part
of the property which belonged to Alveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
eſtate, ſeemed likely to encreaſe theſe
embarraſſments; while the mortgagees
were gradually undermining the eſtate it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and the abſence of the maſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the impatience and miſtruſt of thoſe
who had claims upon it.</p>
            <p>All this, Cathcart thought Celeſtina
ought to know; yet in their firſt interview
that morning he had not courage to tell
her of it, and now Vavaſour left him no
chance of doing it; for while he yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated,
the coach ſent by Lady Horatia
Howard ſtopped at the door, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was come in which he was to take his
leave of her.</p>
            <p>He took her hand, and kiſſed it with an
air of grateful reſpect; but he could only
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0206900203:189"/>
ſay—"I ſhall write to you in a few days,
and, I hope, give you a good account of
my ſiſter and of Jeſſy."</p>
            <p>"I hope you will," returned Celeſtina
faintly.</p>
            <p>"And," added he, "you will of courſe
like to hear of all that paſſes material in our
neighbourhood?"</p>
            <p>"Certainly I ſhall," replied ſhe. "Adieu,
dear Sir. I cannot <hi>ſay</hi> much, but you
know what I feel for you all."</p>
            <p>Vavaſour had taken her hand to lead her
down ſtairs; but ſhe diſengaged it from
him, and ſaid to Cathcart, as ſhe gave it
to him—"Let us go to your ſiſter." He
led her to the door of the room; where at
that moment Mrs. Elphinſtone entered,
pale and breathleſs: her eyes were heavy,
and fixed on Celeſtina, but ſhe did not
weep. Celeſtina's tears, however, were
more ready, and, as ſhe embraced her
friend, they choaked the trembling adieu
ſhe would have uttered, and fell in ſhowers
on her boſom. The emotion was too pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0206900203:190"/>
and Cathcart, deſiring to end it for
both their ſakes, diſengaged his ſiſter
gently from the arms of the trembling Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
while Vavaſour, again ſeizing her
hand, hurried her down ſtairs, and as he
put her into the coach, told her he ſhould
call upon her the next day. She would
have beſought him not to do it, as a liberty
he ought not to take in the houſe whither
ſhe was going; but before ſhe could ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
recover herſelf to find words, the
coach was driven away, and in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhe found herſelf at the door of Lady
Horatia Howard, in Park-ſtreet, Groſvenor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare,
and it became neceſſary for her to
collect her ſpirits, to acquit herſelf as ſo
much kind attention deſerved.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia received her with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
pleaſure, and with a degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
kindneſs that ſet her almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
at eaſe with herſelf. She was put
into poſſeſſion of her apartment, and bade
to remember that it was her's as long as ſhe
would occupy it, and that her time was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0206900203:191"/>
ways to be her own. "I am going out,"
ſaid Lady Horatia, "to dinner to-day. I
have a great notion you had rather dine at
home?" Celeſtina owned ſhe had. "Be
it ſo then," replied ſhe: "and whenever
you prefer being at home to going with
me, I ſhall be pleaſed at your uſing that
freedom, without which ſuch a ſituation as
I am able to offer you would be not only of
no value but a ſpecies of ſlavery." While
ſhe ſaid this in the kindeſt manner, Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
obſerved that ſhe looked very earneſtly
at her eyes, which were red with weeping;
and examined, with a kind of mournful
enquiry, her features, which bore traces of
the concern ſhe had felt in parting from
her friends; and having thus examined her
countenance ſome time, her own, which
was remarkably expreſſive, aſſumed a look
of ſurpriſe tempered with concern; and
then, as if ſhe checked herſelf, ſhe rang
for her woman to receive orders about Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina's
dinner, and while they remained
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0206900203:192"/>
together, ſhe gave the converſation a more
general turn.</p>
            <p>When Celeſtina was alone, ſhe ran over
in her thoughts the tranſactions of the laſt
month, and wondered what Fate would
do with her next. But not of herſelf alone
ſhe thought: Willoughby, unhappy and
unſettled; his mind thrown from its ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
by diſappointment; his talents loſt
in the bewildering uneaſineſs of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and his temper injured by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
anxieties of pecuniary inconvenience;
he, who had ſuch a mind, ſuch a heart,
ſuch talents, ſuch a temper; who deſerved
every happineſs, and yet had hitherto
known none; Willoughby, wandering
about the world to obtain confirmation of
a fact, which, when known, would only
complete his miſery; was an object from
which the thoughts of Celeſtina could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a moment eſcape: and a thouſand
times ſhe wiſhed ſhe had never been born,
ſince to her, to whomſoever ſhe owed her
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0206900203:193"/>
birth, Willoughby certainly owed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs.</p>
            <p>It was time to conſider of obeying the
injunction he gave her, towards the cloſe
of his letter, to write to him; but on this
ſubject ſhe determined to conſult Lady
Horatia Howard, as well as to aſk her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in what way ſhe ſhould act in regard
to Vavaſour, whoſe importunities ſhe
dreaded, yet from whoſe viſits ſhe knew
not how to diſengage herſelf.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch protection, however, ſhe
knew that much of the inconvenience ſhe
muſt in other circumſtances feel from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour's
behaviour would be obviated; and
that the ſenſe as well as the ſituation of
Lady Horatia would prevent that improper
familiarity which, when ſhe was only with
Cathcart or Mrs. Elphinſtone, whom he
looked upon as inferior and as dependent,
it was too much his nature to aſſume.</p>
            <p>With more complacency, ſhe thought
of Montague Thorold, and always of his
father with a degree of affectionate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0206900203:194"/>
As to the young man, though her
heart never admitted, in regard to him, the
ſlighteſt tendency towards that ſort of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
which could ever grow into love, yet
ſhe had received ſo many marks of real and
ardent attachment from him, ſhe thought
ſo well of his talents, and ſo much better
of his heart, that ſhe could never diveſt
herſelf of ſolicitude for his welfare. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps—for
in what heart, however pure,
does not ſome ſuch weakneſs lurk—perhaps,
the ſtories ſhe had heard of his former uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
propenſity to form attachments, and
which were intended to prejudice her
againſt him, had an influence on her mind
of which ſhe was herſelf unconſcious, and
that her ſelf-love, though no human being
ever appeared to have leſs, was gratified by
having thus fixed a man ſo volatile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady,
though ſhe never could, nor ever
had given him reaſon to ſuppoſe ſhe could,
return the paſſion ſhe had thus inſpired.</p>
            <p>While there remained any hope of ever
ſeeing Willoughby ſuch as he had once
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0206900203:195"/>
been, ſhe had felt an utter repugnance to
ſuffer the aſſiduities of Montague Thorold;
but Willoughby's apparent neglect of her
for ſome time before ſhe left the Iſle of
Skie, and the little probability there now
was that they could ever meet in peace,
ſince the receipt of his letter, had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
and almoſt inſenſibly accuſtomed
her to the attentions of Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold:
and though ſhe felt for him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like love, ſhe could not help being
ſenſible of a great difference in her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
towards him and towards Vavaſour.
One ſeemed to live only to obey and oblige
her; the other, preſuming on the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of fortune, or on thoſe which Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby's
friendſhip gave him, appeared
rather to demand than to ſolicit her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard—rather
to reſent her neglect of his
ſuit, than court as a favour her acceptance
of it: and if Celeſtina had any fault, it
was a ſort of latent pride, the child of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
worth and elevated underſtanding;
which, though ſhe was certainly obſcurely,
and poſſibly diſhonourably born, ſhe never
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0206900203:196"/>
could ſubdue, and, perhaps, never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
tried to ſubdue it. She felt, that in
point of intellect ſhe was ſuperior to almoſt
every body ſhe converſed with; ſhe could
not look in the glaſs without ſeeing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of a form, worthy of ſo fair an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
as an enlightened human ſoul;
and could ſhe have been blind to theſe
advantages, the preference Willoughby had
given her ſo early in life would have taught
her all their value.</p>
            <p>It is not the conſciouſneſs of worth that
is offenſive and diſguſting, but the tribute
of reſpect that is demanded of others who
have perhaps no ſuch conviction, and of
whom it is therefore unreaſonable and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant
to expect that they will acknowledge
what they cannot perceive. Nobody was
ever yet eminently handſome in perſon, or
eminently brilliant in intellect, who did
not feel from ſelf evidence that they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
thoſe advantages; though many, from
the infirmity and weakneſs of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0206900203:197"/>
fancy they exiſt where none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
can find any ſhadow of them.</p>
            <p>Good ſenſe, one prominent feature of
which is a due attention to the opinion and
to the ſelf love of the reſt of the world,
will rarely ſuffer thoſe who poſſeſs it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
even real advantages on the notice
of others; and without good ſenſe, little
diſtinction appears between the real bloom
of youth and beauty and the factitious
charms purchaſed at a perſumer's: both
are, if not equally diſguſting, equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
of all that can make them eſtimable
or valuable. Of this good ſenſe, Celeſtina
poſſeſſed ſuch a ſhare, that conſcious as
ſhe was of that ſuperiority of which ſhe was
continually told, no village girl had ever
more unaffected ſimplicity of manners;
and while her mind was irradiated by more
than common genius, and her knowledge
very extenſive for her time of life, ſhe was
in company as ſilent, and as attentive to
the opinion of others, as if ſhe had poſſeſſed
only a plain and common underſtanding,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0206900203:198"/>
with no other cultivation than what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
boarding ſchool education afforded.</p>
            <p>Her pride, therefore, ſo moderated, was
rather a virtue than a blemiſh, and taught
her to value herſelf, but never to deſpiſe
the reſt of the world.</p>
            <p>There was about her, too, much of that
diſpoſition which the French call <hi>ameneté:</hi>
a diſpoſition to pleaſe by ſeeming inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
for others; by entering into their
joys and ſorrows, and by a thouſand little
nameleſs kindneſſes, which though they
conſiſted perhaps only in attending pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to a tale of ſorrow, told by a
mourner of whom the world was tired or
who was tired of the world, or liſtening
with concern to the hiſtory of pain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
related by the valetudinarian,
ſmiling at the fond enthuſiaſm of a mother
when ſhe deſcribed the wit or beauty of a
darling child, or admiring the plans which
an improver had laid down for the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his grounds, were all ſo many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of a good diſpoſition, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0206900203:199"/>
of thoſe towards whom theſe little ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
were exerted, that Celeſtina had
formerly had almoſt as many friends as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
wherever ſhe appeared. In
the circle where ſhe was now to move,
more ſplendid even than that where Mrs.
Willoughby's kindneſs had placed her, it
was probable that under ſuch introduction
as that of Lady Horatia Howard, all the
charms of her perſon, talents, and temper,
would be ſeen to the utmoſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Unaccuſtomed as Vavaſour was to look
far into conſequences, he had diſcerned
this as ſoon as he heard of the invitation
Celeſtina had received; and he foreſaw ſo
many impediments to the purſuit of his
wiſhes, as well from the ſeverity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery
which he had heard imputed to Lady
Horatia, as from the interference of rivals,
that he would very gladly have perſuaded
her againſt accepting it, had he had any
pretence to offer for his objections: but
having none, and not daring to invent any,
he had confined himſelf to mutterings
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0206900203:200"/>
againſt prudiſh old cats, and repreſenting
to Celeſtina that, ſhe was going to confine
herſelf as an humble companion to bear all
the caprices of a ſuperannuated woman of
quality. Celeſtina heard him at firſt with
concern, from an idea that he had heard
Lady Horatia miſrepreſented; but when,
on his afterwards repeating this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhe found that he knew nothing of
her character even from report, and only
deſcribed her in ſo unpleaſant a light from
his wiſh to deter Celeſtina from finding an
aſylum in her houſe, anger conquered her
concern, and even her complaiſance, and
ſhe beſought him in very ſtrong terms ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again to name Lady Horatia Howard
to her, unleſs he could prevail upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to remember that ſhe deſerved, from
her character rather than her rank, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of every man, and particularly of
every <hi>gentleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vavafour had deſiſted then from talking
of her in this ſtyle; but he was not at all
more reconciled to the abode Celeſtina
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0206900203:201"/>
had choſen; where, if he was admitted to
ſee her at all, it would probably be only
in the preſence of thoſe who would be little
affected with his profeſſions of that love
which every day became a greater torment
to him, and little dazzled by that fortune
which he had to offer as the price of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, however, to whom he had
repeatedly ſaid that he would viſit her,
thought ſhe could not too ſoon apprize
Lady Horatia of her ſituation; and the firſt
hour they were alone together, Lady Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
expreſſed ſuch a deſire to know all that
had paſſed in regard to Willoughby, ſince
ſhe ſaw her on her journey into Scotland,
that Celeſtina, without heſitation, but not
without great emotion, related it all, and
put into her hands the letters received from
Willoughby.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia read them, and attended
with great intereſt to what Celeſtina related
of the ſudden appearance of Montague
Thorold and the avowed pretenſions of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0206900203:202"/>
Vavaſour; and after deliberating ſome
time, ſhe ſmiled, yet not with a ſmile of
pleaſure, and ſaid—"It appears, my love,
as if you were only come to tantalize me
for a moment with your company; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
as you are by theſe young men, I ſee I
ſhall never be able to keep you long."</p>
            <p>"Ah! Madam!" replied Celeſtina,
"neither Mr. Vavaſour nor Mr. Thorold
can excite a wiſh in me to quit your protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
while it is convenient to you to afford
it to me; and for my firſt, my moſt beloved
friend! my—what ſhall I call him?—he
talks not of returning to England: and if
he does—"</p>
            <p>"And if he does return," interrupted
Lady Horatia, "you muſt, and rightly
formed as your heart is, you do, I am ſure
underſtand, that while the fainteſt miſt of
doubt hangs over you, you ought never to
meet him, unleſs indeed one of you were
married."</p>
            <p>"Allow me to aſk, Madam," ſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina,
in a tremulous voice, "allow me to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0206900203:203"/>
aſk your Ladyſhip, who were ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Mrs. Willoughby, whether
from any recollection of remarks made in
her life time, you have any perſuaſion as to
the foundation of thoſe doubts."</p>
            <p>"You might have ſeen," replied Lady
Horatia, "from the purport of a letter I
wrote to you while you were in Scotland,
that I had even then heard rumours of the
cauſe of your ſeparation from Willoughby,
which Lady Caſtlenorth had very induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly
ſet forth. I judged, from what I
then heard, that if it was not true, her art
would be ſo effectually exerted that you
would never diſcover the deception; and
that you muſt be rendered unhappy. It
was therefore I adviſed you to detach your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as much as you could from what is
childiſhly called a firſt love. I thought,
that what Mr. Willoughby was then ſaid
to be on the point of completing—his
marriage with Miſs Fitz-Hayman—was the
very beſt thing he could do, both for his
own ſake and your's: for if it ſhould be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0206900203:204"/>
found you are related, the very idea is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with too much horror to be dwelt
upon; and even if it is a fabrication of Lady
Caſtlenorth's, unleſs it can be clearly proved
to be ſo, your whole life might be embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by it; beſides, my dear Celeſtina,
how could Mr. Willoughby, circumſtanced
as I underſtand he is in regard to money
matters, how could he afford to marry
you?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina ſighed deeply from the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of the arrangements as to all thoſe
affairs which Willoughby had ſo fondly
made, and to which ſhe had ſo fondly
liſtened; then recovering herſelf, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
her queſtion, which ſhe thought
Lady Horatia had evaded—"But has your
Ladyſhip any recollection of circumſtances
in Mrs. Willoughby's conduct or life, that
give you reaſon to believe this unhappy
ſtory may <hi>not</hi> be the fabrication of Lady
Caſtlenorth?"</p>
            <p>"Not from my own knowledge," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
ſhe, "for I was in Italy with General
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0206900203:205"/>
Howard, who was then in an ill ſtate of
health, at the time Mr. Willoughby's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died and for two years afterwards.
When I returned to England, I was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
in domeſtic uneaſineſs, and heard,
without attending much to them, thoſe
goſſipping ſtories which fly about for a
week or a month till ſome newer ſcandal
cauſes them to be forgotten. Yet I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect,
I own, hearing ſome hints of Mrs.
Willoughby's partiality for Mr. Everard,
and that they were ſuppoſed to be privately
married: but I accounted for it, when I
attended to it at all, by recollecting that
Mrs. Willoughby was, at the time of her
huſband's death, a young and beautiful
woman, with a good fortune, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
underſtanding; advantages, which,
while they created envy and malignity in
the minds of an hundred people who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
nothing of all that, among her own
ſex; produced as many pretenders to her
favour among the other; every one of
whom, though ſome were men of rank and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0206900203:206"/>
all of courſe eminent enough in their own
eyes, were diſmiſſed by her on their firſt
application with a polite but poſitive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.
Theſe men were piqued, and theſe
women were ſpiteful; and they together
found out a reaſon for the unheard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
of a young and admired widow, by
ſuppoſing her attached to her ſon's tutor;
not one of them, from the information of
their own hearts, being able to conceive it
poſſible that ſhe made this ſacrifice to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
tenderneſs, and refuſed her hand to
a ſecond huſband, becauſe ſhe would ſuffer
nothing to interrupt the attention ſhe owed
to the children of the firſt."</p>
            <p>"You do not then believe," ſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
eagerly—"you do not then believe,
my dear Madam, that there is any truth in
this odious ſtory?"</p>
            <p>"Pardon me," anſwered Lady Horatia;
"I did not ſay ſo."</p>
            <p>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
"is it poſſible you can believe it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0206900203:207"/>
"My dear young friend," ſaid ſhe
calmly, "I have lived ſo long in the
world, that though I do not haſtily and on
ſlight grounds believe ſuch a report, yet I
ſhould not <hi>wonder</hi> were it in the event to be
verified."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who had always in her own
heart oppoſed the idea of her being the
daughter of Mrs. Willoughby, though ſhe
felt and ſubmitted to the neceſſity of ſeeing
Willoughby no more while one doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
unſatisfied, now changed colour,
affected as well by the manner of Lady
Horatia as by what ſhe ſaid. She had not,
however, courage to preſs her farther, but
ſpoke of the viſit intended her by Mr. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour—"I
wiſh it were poſſible," ſaid ſhe,
"to convince him at once that I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
liſten to the propoſal with which he is
pleaſed to honour me. As Willoughby's
friend," added ſhe, and ſighed, "I ſhall
be always glad to ſee him; but, in any
other light, never—".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0206900203:208"/>
"I think you wrong however," replied
Lady Horatia, "in wiſhing ſo haſtily to
diſmiſs him. He is a man of family, of
fortune, and, as you allow, not diſagreeable
in his perſon; and for his morals, they are not
worſe, I ſuppoſe, than thoſe of other young
men; he is allowed, I think, to be generous,
good tempered, and not to want ſenſe. If
every idea of Willoughby is at an end,
why not relieve yourſelf and him from a
ſtate of uneaſy retroſpection by receiving
the addreſſes of one whom he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve."</p>
            <p>"Are you in earneſt, Lady Horatia?"
cried Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>"Certainly I am," replied ſhe: "at
leaſt, I venture very ſeriouſly to adviſe you
not to diſmiſs Vavaſour ſo haſtily, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as an acquaintance till you are
ſure you diſapprove of him as a lover."</p>
            <p>"Dear Madam!" reſumed Celeſtina,
"were I capable of giving away my hand
ſo lightly, is Mr. Vavaſour a man who you
think could make me happy?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0206900203:209"/>
"Nay," replied Lady Horatia, "if
there is any body whom you prefer that is
another point: I only ſay, that if you feel
yourſelf perfectly diſengaged, I cannot
think Vavaſour ought to be diſmiſſed
haſtily. Perhaps half the young women in
London would think a more deſirable match
could not offer."</p>
            <p>This converſation was interrupted by
the entrance of a ſervant, who announced
the arrival of the perſon who was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it; and Vavaſour immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the room.</p>
            <p>He condeſcended to pay to Lady Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
more reſpect than he generally ſhewed
to thoſe who were indifferent to him. Hers
was, however, that ſort of company in
which he by no means found himſelf at
caſe; and his eagerneſs to entertain Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
alone, once or twice broke through
the reſtraint which he impoſed upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia, who was candid and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
ſaw in him only an unformed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0206900203:210"/>
young man, whoſe morals and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
required nothing but time and good
company to render eſtimable. She ſaw the
prejudice Celeſtina ſeemed to entertain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, as a mere prejudice; and on
his riſing to depart, gave him a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
to her houſe.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, who knew the refinement of
her mind, and the delicacy of her taſte, was
amazed at her ſeeming to approve him;
and when he was gone, ventured to ſay—"What
does your Ladyſhip think of Mr.
Vavaſour?"</p>
            <p>"Why really very well," replied ſhe.
"He is very young, and quite unformed;
but with thoſe giddy manners, and amid
that unpoliſhed converſation, there is no
want of underſtanding."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina again ſighed. "No," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, "no want of underſtanding
certainly; for Willoughby was not likely
to ſelect him for his friend had that been
wanting: but yet they were ſo unlike—ſo
very unlike—that I have often wondered at
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0206900203:211"/>
their long and intimate friendſhip. Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
is ſo head long, ſo impetuous, ſo ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willed,
and ſometimes ſo boiſterous, while
Willoughby, with more imagination, more
genius, more ſtrength of underſtanding, is
ſo calm, ſo reaſonable, ſo attentive to every
body—"</p>
            <p>She was too much affected to proceed in
the catalogue of his virtues, a ſubject on
which ſhe had hardly ever touched before;
but ſtopped, from the emotion ſhe felt;
and Lady Horatia, who ſaw and pitied the
ſource of that emotion, changed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour, flattered by the reception he
had met with from the preſent protectreſs
of Celeſtina, and more in love than ever
in proportion as ſhe was in his opinion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
handſomer now than ever, was
now very frequent in his viſits; while Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina's
whole mind was occupied by the
neceſſity ſhe was under of writing to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
and the difficulty ſhe was under
how to anſwer with propriety ſuch a letter
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0206900203:212"/>
as that ſhe had received from him. At
length, with many efforts, and more tears,
the letter was written and approved of by
Lady Horatia; and Celeſtina endeavoured,
in compliance with the wiſhes of her friend,
and with more earneſtneſs than ſucceſs, to
diſmiſs from her mind ſome of its corroſive
ſenſations, and to enter, if not with avidity,
at leaſt with cheerfulneſs, into that ſtyle of
faſhionable life, which, though ſhe could
not always enjoy, ſhe never failed to adorn.</p>

            <p>VAVASOUR had been with her every
day ſince her arrival in town, which was
almoſt a week, and Montague Thorold had
never appeared. While Celeſtina at once
wondered at his abſence and rejoiced at it,
(though perhaps her ſenſations were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with a ſlight degree of mortification,)
for while ſhe diſdained every ſpecies of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry,
ſhe yet felt humiliated by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ceſſation of that attachment which he
had taken ſuch pains to convince her, could
not be deſtroyed even by deſpair.</p>
            <p>Impatience, however, to hear of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
was ſtill predominant in her
mind : and for this purpoſe ſhe wiſhed to
ſee Lady Molyneux. No acquaintance
ſubſiſted between her and Lady Horatia;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0206900203:214"/>
and therefore ſhe determined to write and
beg leave to wait on her old friend. This
ſhe executed in a note to the following
purport:</p>
            <p>"Miſs de Mornay being in town for a
ſhort time, ſolicits permiſſion to wait
on Lady Molyneux at any time when
her Ladyſhip may be diſengaged."</p>
            <p>This note was delivered to Lady Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux
in company. She read it, and as if
ſhe had forgotten totally the claim Celeſtina
had upon her from their having been
brought up together, and from her mother's
fondneſs for her, ſhe aſked careleſsly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the meſſenger waited for an anſwer;
the ſervant replied, that he did. Lady Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux
had formed an idea that Celeſtina,
of whom ſhe had not thought for many
months, was now wandering about the
world in a dependent and inferior ſituation,
and might perhaps expect an invitation to
ſtay with her, which ſhe had no inclination
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0206900203:215"/>
to give; ſhe therefore in a cold and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
way bade the footman tell the perſon
who brought the meſſage, that being then
engaged with company ſhe could not write
an anſwer, but would take an opportunity
of letting Miſs de Mornay know when ſhe
ſhould be at home. She then entered again
into converſation with her gueſts; and it
was not till the next day that ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
having heard from Celeſtina at all;
when ſeeing the note on her table as ſhe
was going to dreſs for the opera, ſhe gave
it to her maid, and bade her put her in
mind to ſend an anſwer to it and fix the
firſt morning ſhe ſhould be diſengaged.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina in the mean time received the
verbal anſwer to her note with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
than ſurpriſe. She had not expected
much kindneſs from Matilda, who during
ſo many months had never once written to,
or enquired after her; but ſhe could not
without internal anguiſh reflect that it was
the daughter of her more than mother, the
friend of her orphan youth, and the ſiſter
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0206900203:216"/>
of Willoughby, who was thus inſenſible of
all thoſe feelings which ſwelled her heart
when the ſcenes of that orphan youth, and
the pleaſures of that infantine friendſhip,
were remembered.</p>
            <p>Amid theſe painful reflections, however,
there was one that gave her ſome degree of
conſolation. She thought that Lady Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux
could not, either from any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of her own, or from the reports
ſpread by Lady Caſtlenorth, believe that
any relationſhip by blood ſubſiſted between
them; for ſhe ſuppoſed it to be impoſſible
for her in that caſe to treat with ſo much
cold neglect a perſon whom ſhe knew to be
her ſiſter. On this, therefore, ſhe dwelt,
as a circumſtance favourable to the notion
ſhe moſt wiſhed to entertain ; and as two
or three days paſſed on without her hearing
from Lady Molyneux, her eagerneſs to
enquire of her ſubſided into a ſtrong belief
that ſhe knew nothing.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour aſſiduouſly attended every day
at the houſe of Lady Horatia during this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0206900203:217"/>
interval, and contrived to obtain for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſome degree of intereſt in her favour.
The openneſs and candour of his temper,
was with her an apology for half his faults;
while his youth and natural vivacity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his pardon for the reſt. His fortune
was ſplendid, and his family ancient and
reſpectable; while his perſon was ſuch as
could hardly fail to pleaſe; and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
careleſs and wild as they were, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to advantage in the eyes of Lady
Horatia; who had been diſguſted by the
coldneſs and apathy, either real or affected,
of many of thoſe young men of faſhion
who frequented her houſe.</p>
            <p>On Celeſtina, however, the frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
ſhe had of obſerving Vavaſour,
had a very oppoſite effect. In <hi>her</hi> mind
a ſtandard of perfection had been early
formed, and every man ſhe now ſaw was
pleaſing or otherwiſe as they reſembled or
differed from Willoughby. She continued
therefore to treat Vavaſour with encreaſing
coldneſs and ſaw with concern that Lady
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0206900203:218"/>
Horatia was every day more ſolicitous for
his ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Willoughby, in the mean time, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to wander about Europe without any
fixed plan, and merely flying from himſelf.
Still anxious to gather information on the
ſubject which had deſtroyed all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his life, and having little hopes of
obtaining any but by means of Lady Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenorth,
he often conquered his reluctance,
and viſited his uncle at a villa he now inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
near Naples; where he was always
received with pleaſure, and where, ſave
only on the point which alone intereſted
him, Lady Caſtlenorth ſeemed to deſcend
from her natural character, to endeavour
by every means in her power to gratify
and oblige him: and her lord, who really
loved his nephew as much as his imbecility
of mind allowed him to love any body,
and who ſaw in him and in his alliance
with his daughter, the only chance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating
a family which was the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his pride, became hourly more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0206900203:219"/>
to ſee him, and more gratified by his
company.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved, that there are two
reaſons which equally operate in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome people to marry—love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
and ſomething reſembling both theſe
ſentiments agitated the heart of Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hayman.
Of an involuntary preference to
her couſin, ſhe had been ſenſible from the
firſt moment ſhe ſaw him; and his indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
his preference of Celeſtina, and
even his poſitively declining the honour of
her hand, had mortified without curing her
of her partiality; though reſentment and
diſdain were mingled with the inclination
ſhe could not conquer, and which neither
his abſence nor his coldneſs. had prevented
from gaining on her heart. When ſhe ſaw
him again, new force was given to this
paſſion: he was leſs handſome, leſs ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated;
but more intereſting and more
pleaſing; while his melancholy and dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though created by another object,
gave him ſo many charms in the opinion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0206900203:220"/>
of Miſs Fitz-Hayman, that her pride
yielded to them; and as it was now very
certain that he had no attachment but to
Celeſtina, whom, ſince ſhe fully believed
their relationſhip, ſhe knew he never could
marry, ſhe doubted not of being able to
inſpire him with an affection for her, and,
in returning to England his wife, of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
at once her parents wiſhes and her
own.</p>
            <p>Lady Caſtlenorth, whoſe love of intrigue
time had by no means diminiſhed, and
whoſe arrogance had been deeply wounded
by the failure of her original plan, which
ſhe fancied Willoughby would with ſo
much eagerneſs have embraced, was now
doubly anxious to avail herſelf of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
ſhe had gained by having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the intended union of Willoughby
and Celeſtina. Pique and reſentment ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
upon her mind with even more force
than attachment and regard would have on
another. Beſides, in the marriage of her
daughter with any man of ſuperior rank
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0206900203:221"/>
and independent fortune, ſhe found great
probability that her influence would be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened
and her government diſclaimed; but
in uniting her daughter with Willoughby,
whoſe fortune was in diſorder and whoſe
temper was remarkably eaſy, ſhe foreſaw
the continuation of her power, and that ſhe
ſhould neither ſee her daughter take place
of her, or eſcape from her influence.</p>
            <p>Whatever was the wiſh of her friends,
the aſſiduous Mrs. Calder officiouſly
adopted; and when ſhe found how much
Lord Caſtlenorth had ſet his heart on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the marriage between his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and her nephew, ſhe applied all her
rhetoric to prove its advantages, and all her
art to ſecure it's ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Willoughby was unconſcious of the plans
that were thus forming in the family of his
uncle, and did not think it poſſible that
their pride would allow them to ſolicit again
an alliance which he had once declined:
he therefore went to them without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
that he was encouraging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0206900203:222"/>
he never meant to fulfil, and
had indeed no other deſign than to lay in
wait for traces of that involved myſtery,
which he ſtill thought had been created by
the intrigues and machinations of Lady
Caſtlenorth.</p>
            <p>In art, however, ſhe was ſo much his
ſuperior, that the very means he adopted
to obtain ſatisfaction, was, in her hands, a
means of bewildering more deeply. She
now affected the moſt perfect candour; and
whenever ſhe ſaw him touching with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand on the ſubject, ſhe appeared to
feel for his uneaſineſs, and ready to give
him every ſatisfaction in her power.</p>
            <p>Willing to avail himſelf of this apparent
diſpoſition in his favour, he one day, when
he was ſitting alone with Lady Caſtlenorth,
aſked her, whether ſhe had now no traces
of Hannah Biſcoe, the ſervant who alone
ſeemed poſſeſſed of the circumſtances into
which he moſt wiſhed to enquire. Lady
Caſtlenorth anſwered with great apparent
ingenuouſneſs, that ſhe did not exactly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0206900203:223"/>
know, as ſhe had no connection at all with
her, but that if he wiſhed to make any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
her woman ſhould write out the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to her relations, which ſhe did not
herſelf recollect.</p>
            <p>Willoughby eagerly ſeized on this offer,
and begged that theſe directions might be
immediately written out for him. Lady
Caſtlenorth inſtantly called her woman,
and queſtioned her as to her recollection of
the abode of the relations of this Hannah
Biſcoe; the woman named what ſhe knew;
her lady directed her to put it down, and
Willoughby left the houſe, flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that he had at length obtained a clue
which might lead him to eſcape from the
labyrinth of error and miſtake where he
had ſo ſeverely ſuffered.</p>
            <p>It was, however, by no means Lady
Caſtlenorth's plan to ſuffer Willoughby to
return to England in ſearch of this woman,
whoſe direction ſhe ſeemed ſo willing to
give him; and as from the eagerneſs and
agitation he expreſſed on receiving this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0206900203:224"/>
it appeared but too likely that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
going himſelf, in order to preclude
the poſſibility of his views being again
fruſtrated, ſhe found that all her art would
be neceſſary to prevent his eſcaping her.</p>
            <p>Fortunately for her views, Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
was ſeized a few hours afterwards
with one of thoſe illneſſes which had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
reduced him to the brink of the grave;
and the preſence of his nephew, which he
ſo earneſtly deſired, the generous and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart of Willoughby could not deny;
while he endured the cruelleſt reſtraint in
ſtaying, and thought every hour an age
till he could go himſelf to England, and
renew his hitherto hopeleſs reſearch after
the real ſituation of Celeſtina.</p>
            <p>Thus paſſed, however, a month after the
arrival of Celeſtina in London; and then
the arrival of an Engliſh gentleman at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
brought him her letter, written in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to that ſhe received at York. Nothing
could equal the impatience with which he
had expected this letter, but the pain he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0206900203:225"/>
felt at reading it. He learned by it that
ſhe was returning to London, where he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
ſo many objects would combine to
ſoften her concern for their ſeparation;
and he fancied the letter expreſſed too
much calmneſs, and that ſhe ſubmitted to
the ſeparation which he had himſelf indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
as too likely to be inevitable without
feeling half that regret and anguiſh which
he expected ſhe would have deſcribed.
The reluctance ſhe expreſſed to be left to
the protection of Vavaſour, made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his preſence interfered with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to ſome other perſon—a preference,
of which the very ſuſpicion threw him into
agonies at the very moment his reaſon
told him that he ought not to think of her
for himſelf. Jealouſy now added to the
pangs of diſappointed love, and the letter
which Celeſtina had endeavoured to word
ſo as to calm and ſooth him, and to teach
him to ſubmit to that neceſſity of which he
allowed the force, ſeemed to him to
breathe only indifference, and to prove that
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0206900203:226"/>
ſhe ſaw him, without regret, relinquiſh his
claim to thoſe affections, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in poſſeſſion of another.</p>
            <p>All his ſufferings were confirmed and
encreaſed, when a day or two afterwards
he had an opportunity of converſing with
Mr. Jarvis, the gentleman who brought
the letter, and who was haſtening to Rome.
He had been often in company with Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
at parties where ſhe attended Lady
Horatia Howard; and believing, as all the
world now did, that Willoughby was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be married to Miſs Fitz-Hayman;
and that the marriage of Celeſtina would be
a ſubject of ſatisfaction to him, he related
without heſitation the reports he had heard
of her being ſoon to give her hand to Mr.
Vavaſour.</p>
            <p>To the amazement Willoughby expreſſed
at the firſt intimation of ſuch a match, Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,
who entirely miſtook it's cauſe, ſaid—"Yes,
it is wonderful to be ſure, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all we know of Vavaſour, that he ſhould
ſeriouſly intend to marry."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0206900203:227"/>
So acute was the pain which the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
Willoughby had juſt received gave
him, that he could make no anſwer to this;
and Jarvis fancying him out of ſpirits for
ſome reaſon or other which he never
thought of enquiring after, ſoon after left
him to meditate on what he had heard.</p>
            <p>There was "room for meditation even
"to madneſs," when he recollected a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
circumſtances that had till now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
of no moment; he was convinced
that Vavaſour had long admired Celeſtina;
he had himſelf reſigned her, or at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
that he dared not think of her;
and the perſon, the fortune, the impetuous
ardour of Vavaſour, which his agitated
mind repreſented as irreſiſtible, now all
crouded on his recollection, and he doubted
not but that before he could reach England,
Celeſtina would have given herſelf away.</p>
            <p>Yet with the horrid myſtery unremoved,
on what pretence could he wiſh or even
think of impeding a marriage with a man
of whom his regard was evinced by his long
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0206900203:228"/>
friendſhip, and who had ſo affluent a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
As a lover, he could himſelf no
longer interfere; as her relation, he could
not bear to conſider himſelf; and were he
only ſuch, an alliance with Vavaſour could
not be objected to on any reaſonable
grounds.</p>
            <p>The longer he reflected, therefore, on
what he had heard, the more unable he
became to ſupport his reflections; and they
concluded in a reſolution to ſet out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
for England; a determination which
he communicated to his uncle the ſame
day, who was affected by it even to tears.</p>
            <p>Lady Caſtlenorth had, in converſation
with Mr. Jarvis, heard the report of Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina's
intended marriage, and knew imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
how to account for the extreme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs
Willoughby betrayed, and his
ſudden reſolution to depart for England.
When Jarvis, who proceeded immediately
on his journey, was gone, ſhe found an
opportunity a few hours afterwards to ſpeak
to Willoughby on Engliſh news, and the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0206900203:229"/>
change of his countenance confirmed her
conjectures. This was an occaſion not to
be loſt; ſhe ventured, what ſhe uſually
avoided, to name Celeſtina, and to expreſs
her ſatisfaction that ſhe was likely to be ſo
well married. "After all the converſation
there has been about this young perſon,"
ſaid ſhe, affecting to have a great deal of
feeling for her, "I am very glad that the
poor girl will be ſo well eſtabliſhed. A man
of Vavaſour's independent fortune can well
afford to pleaſe himſelf; and I doubt not
but that you and Lady Molyneux muſt on
every account rejoice at her change of
name, and that nothing more will be ſaid
of her origin." Though Lady Caſtlenorth
affected to ſpeak with ſentiment, and to
ſoſten her voice, her piercing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
eyes were demanding from the
countenance of Willoughby that explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which ſhe knew it would give of his
real ſentiments; and ſhe ſaw the blood for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his cheeks, his lips turn white and
tremble, and a mingled expreſſion of doubt,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0206900203:230"/>
fear, anger, and diſdain, marked on his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
"If I were certain, Madam," ſaid
he, "that all the odious reports, on which
<hi>you,</hi> who firſt promulgated them, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably
refuſed to ſatisfy me as you might
do—if I were ſure they were all true—"</p>
            <p>"If!" interrupted Lady Caſtlenorth:
"can you then doubt their truth? Will
you compel me to make, by adducing
thoſe proofs, a matter public which you
ought on every account to wiſh might be
buried in eternal oblivion?"</p>
            <p>"Will I compel you, Madam! Yes
ſurely I will if the means are in my power.
'Tis for this only I have been ſo much with
you; not to compel you indeed, but in
the hope of prevailing upon you, if you
really poſſeſs the evidence you have often
meditated, to give it me all without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve."</p>
            <p>"Well," cried Lady Caſtlenorth, "I
have now given you a direction to the only
perſon who is in poſſeſſion of this evidence.
You might have procured it as long ſince as
when I interfered to ſave you from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0206900203:231"/>
of a marriage which muſt have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
you and the object of your unhappily
placed affection miſerable for ever: but
then you flew from me, and reſented my
friendſhip as if it had been an injury.
Since that time it is not my fault if you
have been unable to find this perſon, whom
I have never ſecreted, and of whom I know
little or nothing. Satisfied in having ſaved
you from an abyſs of guilt and miſery, I
truſted to time and your own principles to
convince you of the injuſtice your ſuſpicions
did me. You have ſearched for prooſs in
thoſe places where your mother is ſaid to
have been with her young charge: tell me,
have you ever found any reaſon to believe
the facts I told you of to be of my inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—to
have been totally unfounded?"</p>
            <p>Willoughby was conſcious he had not;
yet at the ſame moment he diſcovered that
Lady Caſtlenorth had watched him, and
knew of the journies he had made to Hieres
and to other places. Vexed and angry,
not knowing what to think, or whether he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0206900203:232"/>
was impoſed on by her ſuperior cunning,
or was needleſsly tormenting himſelf in
puſhing the enquiry farther, he could not
command the various uneaſy ſenſations
with which he was agitated; and therefore
abruptly leaving the room, he haſtened to
his lodgings, and gave directions for his
immediate departure for England.</p>
            <p>He was concerned, however, for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and returned in the evening to take
leave of him: he found him ſitting with
Mrs. Calder, who was reading to him a
ſort of <hi>catalogue raiſonnée</hi> of the various ills
to which the human body is ſubject; and as
they paſſed in melancholy review before
him, he ſtopped her to. conſult her on his
own ſymptoms, and to enquire of her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe did not think ſuch and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
were about to add to his bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
Mrs. Calder, who was always
obliged to every body who fancied her
ſkill enabled her to anſwer ſuch queſtions,
was delighted with the opportunity this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
her of exhibiting her knowledge to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0206900203:233"/>
Willoughby, from whom ſhe could never
procure the ſmalleſt voluntary attention;
and the converſation became ſo irkſome,
that having waited near an hour, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it not likely to end, Willoughby at
length ſtarted up and approached to take
his uncle's hand, when Miſs Fitz-Hayman,
in all the languor of unhappy love, ſwam
into the room.</p>
            <p>On her entrance, Willoughby ſat down
again, as being unwilling to have her
ſuppoſe he rudely fled from her approach.
She put on an air of affected humility, and
looked as if ſhe thanked him for even this
ſlight mark of attention. She gave a loud
and deep ſigh, prolonged as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
her eyes, robbed of their fire, were
turned mournfully upon him—"You are
going from us, Mr. Willoughby?" ſaid
ſhe, in a ſubdued and faint voice.</p>
            <p>He replied, that buſineſs, which could
not longer be delayed, made his return to
England neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0206900203:234"/>
Another deep ſigh was all the lady's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this information: but Lord Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
cried—"I am ſorry to hear you ſay
ſo, George—very ſorry. I did hope that
we might have all returned together as ſoon
as my complaints ſubſide a little. As to
buſineſs, you ought to remember that all
your money matters might be eaſily ſettled
if you pleaſed."</p>
            <p>"I thank you, Sir," replied Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
who ſaw whither the diſcourſe would
tend; "but thoſe matters are the leaſt of
my concern."</p>
            <p>"Stay, however, one day," ſaid Lord
Caſtlenorth, "that you may execute ſome
buſineſs for me. Surely, nephew, you will
oblige me ſo far."</p>
            <p>Though every hour's delay was death to
him, he at length agreed, on his uncle's
repeated entreaties, to ſtay four and twenty
hours longer at Naples; and then leaving
the room, he was followed by the officious
Mrs. Calder, who deſiring leave to ſay half
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0206900203:235"/>
a dozen words to him alone, he ſuffered
her to ſhew him into another room.</p>
            <p>She put on a moſt rueful countenance,
ſtroked her handkerchief, plaited her ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
and uttering an "oh dear!" between
a ſigh and a groan, ſhe continued thus—"My
dear good Sir! I wiſh to have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
converſation relative to your ſituation in
this dear worthy family, for every member
of which my poor heart bleeds."</p>
            <p>"And yet, Madam," interrupted Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
impatiently, "there is, perhaps,
hardly a family among your acquaintance
who are, in the opinion of the world, ſo little
objects of compaſſion."</p>
            <p>"The world!" exclaimed the lady.
"Lord bleſs me, what ſignifies the opinion
of the world. The world cannot ſee as I
do into all their feelings. There's your
moſt excellent uncle, as worthy a man as
ever exiſted, ſinking, poor good dear
man! under five complaints, all incurable,
and denied, alas! the only ſatisfaction this
world has to give him—ſeeing his darling
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0206900203:236"/>
daughter ſettled to his wiſhes, which would
ſmooth his path to heaven, and leave him
nothing but bodily pain—which is ſevere
enough—nothing but bodily pain, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
to contend with. Oh! Sir, what
heart felt ſatisfaction it muſt be to you!
what comfortable reflection for a good heart,
ſuch as inhabits your breaſt no doubt—I
ſay, what delight it would be to you, to
hold forth the amiable hand that ſhould—
<q>Rock the cradle of repoſing age,</q>
and ſooth the latter days of ſo excellent
and worthy an uncle."</p>
            <p>The whine, and the hypocritical gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace
with which this ſpeech was delivered,
would have conquered the gravity of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
at any other time: but he now
felt his diſguſt irritated by impatience,
amounting almoſt to rage; but he repreſſed
his feelings with difficulty, unwilling by
oppoſition to lengthen the converſation,
which Mrs. Calder ſuffered not to languiſh,
but thus went on—"Ah dear! what a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0206900203:237"/>
reflection, as I obſerved, it is, to
conſider, that, poor good man, this is not
likely to happen; and inſtead of it, this
darling daughter, this fine young woman,
heireſs to ſuch a noble fortune, ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſo accompliſhed, ſo elegant—undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the firſt match in England in point of
rank and beauty and fortune—ſo lovely in
perſon, ſo amiable in mind, ſo elevated in
underſtanding—far, alas! from being happy,
ſees her youth paſs away in a hopeleſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which from her infancy ſhe has been
taught to cheriſh, and which now her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
aided by her affronted pride, tries in
vain to repreſs. Oh! Mr. Willoughby!
Mr. Willoughby! the happineſs that you
refuſe, by how many would be courted!
The heart that you diſdain to accept, by
how many would be adored! Dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
when I ſee how thin ſhe is grown,
and know the cauſe of it ſo well!—when I
hear her ſigh, and know how injurious it is
to her dear delicate conſtitution, I really
Sir—you will forgive my zeal—have looked
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0206900203:238"/>
upon you with amazement, and have aſked
myſelf whether you have eyes—whether
you have a heart—"</p>
            <p>"To what, Madam," interrupted Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
who could no longer endure her
harangue patiently—"to what does all this
tend?"</p>
            <p>"Tend, dear Sir!" replied Mrs. Calder;
"why certainly to open your eyes if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a ſenſe of the happineſs you are throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away; to prevail on you to anſwer the
expectations of all your friends, to conſult
your own intereſt, and to become all you
ought to be."</p>
            <p>"You mean well, I conclude, Madam,"
anſwered Willoughby, "by all this; but
you miſtake greatly, when you ſuppoſe
that the alliance to which you allude would
contribute to the happineſs of any of the
parties for whom you are intereſted. I
have no heart to offer Miſs Fitz-Hayman;
and if the partiality which you repreſent
exiſts any where but in your own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it would be ungenerous to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0206900203:239"/>
and unworthy to avail myſelf of it,
feeling as I do that I never can anſwer it
as I am very willing to allow the young
lady's merits deſerve: excuſe me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if I entreat of you never to conſider
me as being likely to be more cloſely united
with the family of Lord Caſtlenorth than I
at preſent am, and to declare to you, that
by perſiſting in preſſing it, my uncle will
put it out of my power to teſtify for him
that regard and affection which I really
feel."</p>
            <p>Willoughby then left the room; and
Mrs. Calder, piqued and mortified at the
little ſucceſs of her rhetoric, went reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
to give an account to Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north,

            <p>WILLOUGHBY, notwithſtanding
every effort and every art made uſe of to
detain him, purſued his way to England:
but at Paris, the fatigue he had undergone,
and the anxiety which had ſo long weighed
on his ſpirits, combined to throw him into
one of thoſe fevers, to which, from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
he had been ſubject; and for three
weeks he was in the moſt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Amid the wild ravings of the delirium
that perpetually occurred during the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
paroxyſms of the complaint, he called
inceſſantly on Celeſtina; and complaining
that Lady Caſtlenorth had taken her from
him, entreated of his ſervant, a man who
had lived with him for ſome years, to ſend
for her that he might ſee her before he died.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0206900203:241"/>
This, in the ſimplicity of his heart, his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
attendant would have done, having no
idea that any thing could be of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
than the wiſhes of his dear maſter,
for whoſe life he was ſo cruelly alarmed;
but when he aſked him whither he was to
ſend, Willoughby put his hand on his
heart, ſighed deeply, and replied, either
that he did not know or that it would be of
no effect; for that, indifferent what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of him, ſhe had already refuſed to
come to him, and was gone to Scotland
with Vavaſour.</p>
            <p>When the violence of the diſeaſe ſubſided,
he ceaſed to name her; and his ſervant,
afraid of renewing his recollection, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoided any hint of what he had
dwelt upon during his delirious ravings.
Slowly, and with two relapſes, he recovered
ſtrength enough to proceed to Calais; but
nine weeks had elapſed ſince the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had received from Vavaſour; and it
was near three months after that time before
he arrived in London.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0206900203:242"/>
His firſt enquiry was after Vavaſour,
who was, he found, in Staffordſhire; and
his heart was relieved by the intelligence,
for he dreaded leaſt he ſhould have met
him in London, perhaps married to Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.
His next was after his ſiſter, whom
he ſtill loved, and in favour of whom he
was willing to forget all the neglect he had
experienced from her, as well as the cauſes
of diſpleaſure given him by her huſband.</p>
            <p>After Celeſtina he feared to aſk by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
meſſage to herſelf, and he therefore
ſought ſomebody who could tell where ſhe
now was, of which he concluded he ſhould
have intelligence from Lady Molyneux.</p>
            <p>Lady Molyneux attended his ſummons;
and while he embraced her, with tears of
fraternal fondneſs, from a thouſand tender
recollections that crouded on his heart, he
ſaw her equally unmoved by their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and unconcerned at his illneſs, of which
he ſtill retained melancholy proofs in his
altered countenance and reduced figure.
He took an early opportunity of turning
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0206900203:243"/>
the diſcourſe on Celeſtina; and ſaw, with
encreaſed amazement, that far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intereſted in the enquiry which had
occupied his whole thoughts ſo long,
Matilda was perfectly indifferent about it,
or if he moved her a moment from the ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of faſhionable apathy, ſhe ſhrunk from
the ſubject with ſomething like diſguſt;
ſeemed afraid of the trouble of inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and careleſs how it might terminate;
wiſhing rather to hear nothing about it,
than to hazard—not the tarniſhing her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
honour, for to that ſhe ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
but the probability of being obliged
to own for a ſiſter, one whom ſhe had
hitherto conſidered as a dependent; and
of ſeeing her brother, from a point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
undertake to provide for her as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Avarice, the heterogeneous child
of ſelfiſh vanity, was become a leading
feature in the character of Matilda: ſhe
found ſo many uſes for money in adorning
and in indulging herſelf, that ſhe loved no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo well, except the adulation it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0206900203:244"/>
for her; and ſo much power has this
odious paſſion to pervert the heart, that
inſtead of feeling concern in contemplating
the ſunken features and palid cheek of her
brother, ſhe could not, nor indeed did ſhe
attempt to check, a half formed idea of the
pecuniary advantage ſhe ſhould receive
from his death.</p>
            <p>While ſuch were her thoughts, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
aſked her when ſhe had laſt ſeen
Celeſtina?</p>
            <p>"Oh!" replied ſhe, "I have ſeen her
only once in a room, and that was by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
I was never at home when ſhe called;
and I hate that old Lady Horatia Howard
that ſhe lives with, and ſo took no great
pains to meet them when I returned her
viſit. I have ſeen her though in public five
or ſix times lately, but the girl ſeemed to
me ſo very much altered, and to give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſuch intolerable airs, that I rather
ſhunned than ſought her.</p>
            <p>"Airs!" cried Willoughby. "She muſt
indeed be greatly changed if ſhe deſerves
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0206900203:245"/>
ſuch cenſure: but tell me, Matilda—what
kind of airs?"</p>
            <p>"Oh! the airs of a beauty," anſwered
ſhe, "which you firſt taught her to aſſume,
and which ſhe has made a tolerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in, ſince this old cat of faſhion has
taken it into her head to make ſuch a fuſs
about her, and ſince ſhe has been ſurrounded
with ſuch a ſet of ſenſeleſs boys. There's
your friend Vavaſour conſtantly one of her
ſuit, and there was a notion of his being
fool enough to marry her, but I fancy that
was given out merely by her exorbitant
vanity, for I dare ſay Vavaſour knows
better."</p>
            <p>The heart of Willoughby ſunk within
him; but he was unable to expreſs what he
felt; and Lady Molyneux went on—"However,
I have heard ſince, I think,
that the girl has been addreſſed by another
young fellow—one of the Thorolds I
think—whom I have lately ſeen with her,
which would be more ſuitable and more
likely to be a match."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0206900203:246"/>
"You have ſeen her then often?" ſaid
Willoughby, in a faint and faultering
voice.</p>
            <p>"Yes, in public," replied his ſiſter;
"but I have had no converſation with her."
Lady Molyneux then changed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and ſoon afterwards left her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more unhappy than ſhe had found him.</p>
            <p>He was by no means able to ſee Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
in his preſent ſtate of wretched uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty:
yet to know that by traverſing two
or three ſtreets he could once more behold
her, once more gaze on that lovely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and hear that voice ſo ſoothing,
ſo enchanting to his ears; was to him a ſtate
of tantalizing miſery, from which he knew
nothing could relieve him but detecting
the falſhood of Lady Caſtlenorth's report;
and this he could only hope to do by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
journey into Yorkſhire, in order to
find that Hannah Biſcoe to whom he now
thought he had certainly obtained a direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and this he propoſed doing immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0206900203:247"/>
Celeſtina, however, ſurrounded by crouds
of admirers; Celeſtina, forgetting all the
tenderneſs ſhe once felt for him and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his reſearches fruitleſs even if they
proved to him that he might again plead
for the renewal of that affection, was an
idea that unceaſingly tormented him; and
ſo painfully did the intelligence affect him
which Lady Molyneux had given, that the
ferment of his ſpirits produced a return of
his fever; in a ſlighter degree, but ſtill ſo
as to confine him to his room; where, in a
few days, he received a viſit from Vavaſour.</p>
            <p>Vavaſour was totally unconſcious of the
ſpecies of diſtreſs which Willoughby ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
and ſince he himſelf had reſigned
her, and agreed to complete his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the family of Caſtlenorth, for ſo
his conduct had been generally underſtood
in England, had no notion that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of another, and particularly of his
friend, could be otherwiſe than pleaſing to
him. He began, therefore, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking
the concern and coldneſs of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0206900203:248"/>
imputing it only to his viſibly
deranged health, to relate to him his own
views in regard to Celeſtina, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of her preference of Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold.
"The devil take me," ſaid he, "if
there is in England or in Europe another
woman for whom I would take a fifth part
of the trouble which this bewitching girl
has already given me. Curſe me if I am
not aſhamed of myſelf when I think what
a whining puppy ſhe has made of me; ten
times I have left her, and ten times have
returned, to prove to her that ſhe might
uſe me like a dog."</p>
            <p>"Miſs de Mornay," ſaid Willoughby,
in a voice affected by the various ſenſations
he felt—"Miſs de Mornay muſt be greatly
changed, Sir, if ſhe is become capable of
any improper levity towards any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who profeſſes regard for her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the
ſame time you will recollect, Mr. Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
that ſhe is miſtreſs of herſelf, and at
liberty to reject thoſe whoſe offers may not
be acceptable to her. From the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0206900203:249"/>
which you have been pleaſed to
make, (though from our long friendſhip I
ſhould rather have expected you to have
applied to me before you made them)—from
the experiments you have been pleaſed
to make, it ſeems clear that Miſs De Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay
has no favourable intentions towards
you, and I would adviſe you by all means
to decline the purſuit."</p>
            <p>"May I periſh if I do!" replied Vava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,
with all his uſual impetuoſity. "No,
George, unleſs it can be made to appear
that young Thorold—that little curatizing
fellow—without a ſhilling, and with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his impudence and ſcraps of plays
to recommend him, has better pretenſions
than I have, curſe me if I will give it up!"</p>
            <p>This ſecond intimation of Celeſtina's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the addreſſes of Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
was a ſecond dagger in the ſick heart
of Willoughby. He dreaded an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, while it might ſerve perhaps
to ſubdue all his fears as to Vavaſour,
might create others equally inſupportable.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0206900203:250"/>
He could not, however, remain many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
in the breathleſs agitation of ſuch ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and therefore ſaid—"I really don't
know any thing about Thorold. I hardly
recollect that there was ſuch a man."</p>
            <p>"What!" exclaimed Vavaſour; "not
know him? Not know that ſhe went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from Alveſtone to the houſe of
that old prieſt his father."</p>
            <p>"Yes," anſwered Willoughby, "that
I certainly knew; for it was by my requeſt
that the elder Mr. Thorold became her
guardian."</p>
            <p>"Well, nothing was ſo natural, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as for his reverence to delegate the
truſt to his ſon; and as his deputy; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it was, that he went with his ward to
Scotland, and was her guardian all the
time ſhe was among the highlands and the
iſlands."</p>
            <p>"Impoſſible!" cried Willoughby. "He
did not—could not have been there."</p>
            <p>"He was by heaven!" exclaimed Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour;
"and when I met Celeſtina, with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0206900203:251"/>
your letter, at York, I found that young
fellow attending on her and Mrs. Elphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone:
but <hi>I</hi> was authoriſed by yourſelf to
wait on her; and I obliged <hi>him</hi> there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
a poſt, which, when I think of his
having ſo long filled, and apparently with
her approbation, by all that's diabolical I
could tear his puritanical ſoul out!"</p>
            <p>Nothing that Willoughby had ever felt
was equal to the anguiſh which preſſed on
his heart at this moment. The coldneſs
he fancied he had found in Celeſtina's laſt
letter was now accounted for; and all the
warmth of grateful praiſe, with which in
her former letters ſhe had ſpoken of Mr.
Thorold, was imputed to her growing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for his ſon. Loſt as ſhe might be,
and probably was to him for ever before
this intelligence, unleſs he could content
himſelf with that ſhare of ſiſterly affection
which was all ſhe ought to beſtow, there
was ſomething ſo terrible to his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in her feeling a warm attachment to
another, that he could not think of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0206900203:252"/>
horror, nor conceal from Vavaſour the
effect it had upon him. His mildneſs of
manners forſook him; and ſpeaking leſs
like himſelf than like Vavaſour, whoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
he ſeemed to adopt, he cried, in
a voice that trembled with paſſion—"How
dared he pretend to Celeſtina!"</p>
            <p>"He not only dared then," interrupted
Vavaſour, "but dares ſtill; and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to get Lady Horatia Howard to be
of his party. He has faſcinated the old
woman with his piety and his poetry, and
I ſee very plainly that the young one will
throw herſelf away upon him unleſs you
prevent it."</p>
            <p>"May I periſh," cried he, "if I do
<hi>not!</hi>" Yet at that moment the recollection
too forcibly occurred to him that he had no
right to prevent it, unleſs by urging a claim
as her relation, from which his ſoul recoiled.
So painfully acute were his preſent ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he was unable to breathe, and
without attending longer to the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Vavaſours who eagerly preſſed him
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0206900203:253"/>
to interfere immediately, he abruptly left
the room, and ſent by his ſervant a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to Vavaſour, ſaying he found himſelf
ſo ill that he was gone to bed; but ſhould
be glad he would call again for an hour in
the evening.</p>
            <p>Inſtead, however, of attempting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that repoſe which his encreaſed fever
required, he went to the trunk where Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina's
letters were depoſited, and with
trembling hands taking them out, he ran
them over, even from the firſt ſhe wrote to
him after their ſeparation, to the laſt which
Mr. Jarvis had delivered to him at Naples.</p>
            <p>His apprehenſive jealouſy ſo powerfully
awakened, now taught him to fancy, that
from the moment of Celeſtina's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with Montague Thorold, her letters
had become gradually cooller, and that
the laſt too plainly evinced her cheerful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence
to that reluctant and only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
reſignation, which <hi>be</hi> had with ſo
much anguiſh of heart been compelled to
ſend her, while he explained the cruel cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0206900203:254"/>
that had torn him from her and
from happineſs.</p>
            <p>The longer he dwelt on her letters, the
more this idea was ſtrengthened, and the
more inſupportable it became. His illneſs,
originally occaſioned by anxiety, returned
upon him; and though without delirium,
his fever was nearly as high as when he was
in ſo much danger at Paris.</p>
            <p>He now determined to ſend to Lady
Horatia Howard; and he attempted to
write to her. But he could hardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his pen, and found himſelf wholly
unequal to the more difficult taſk of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch a letter as could alone be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
He threw away the paper in deſpair;
and calling his ſervant, ordered him to
find out immediately ſome means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
acquainted with the ſervants of
Lady Horatia Howard, and procure intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of what viſitors were moſt at the
houſe, particularly if a Mr. Thorold of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire
was there often.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0206900203:255"/>
The man haſtened to enter on a taſk by
no means difficult to him. He contrived
the ſame afternoon to introduce himſelf to
one of the footmen of Lady Horatia at the
porter houſe he frequented, and learned
that his miſtreſs and her young friend, of
whom he ſpoke as of an angel, were gone
for a fortnight or three weeks on a viſit into
Oxfordſhire; that Mr. Vavaſour uſed to be
a good deal at the houſe when firſt Lady
Horatia came to town; that now he was
much leſs frequently there; but that Mr.
Thorold was there almoſt every day, and
read to the ladies whole evenings; who,
ſince theſe reading parties at home, went
much leſs into public than they had done
before.</p>
            <p>This intelligence diſtracted Willoughby
by redoubling every apprehenſion he had
felt. The man, however, was ſent back
for further information, and bade to aſk if
Mr. Thorold was of their party in their
preſent journey, and if there was any talk
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0206900203:256"/>
among the ſervants of an intended marriage
between him and Miſs De Mornay.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to theſe queries, he had the
mortification of hearing that Montague
Thorold was to meet the ladies at Oxford;
and that it was, in the family, generally
underſtood that he was the accepted lover
of Celeſtina, and highly approved by Lady
Horatia.</p>
            <p>It was now that the corroſive jealouſy
that had long tormented him had a decided
object, and fixed with the moſt envenomed
power on the heart of Willoughby. The
impoſſibility of his interfering, to prevent
Celeſtina giving herſelf to another while he
himſelf remained in ſuch a ſituation as the
preſent, and dared not even ſee her; the
little probability he ſaw of removing the
doubts that diſtracted him; and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
leaſt if they were for ever effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
withdrawn Celeſtina would rejoice that
they were ſo; the cruel idea of Montague
Thorold's poſſeſſing that heart which he
once knew to be all his own, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0206900203:257"/>
of that elegant mind of which he
had with ſo much delight contemplated the
improvement; were thoughts that inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
purſued and tormented him: and he
had no means of obtaining any information
of the conduct of Celeſtina, or of her return
to town, but by his ſervant, who was now
employed whole days to gather from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics
of Lady Horatia, intelligence,
which, when obtained, ſerved only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his miſery.</p>
            <p>The anecdotes he gathered from his ſiſter
ſerved too but to aggravate his diſtreſs: yet
when he ſaw her, (as he generally did once
every day,) from whatever point the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
ſat out, it always ended in queſtions
about Celeſtina: and Lady Molyneux,
who had inſenſibly familiariſed her mind to
the idea of her brother's dying a bachelor
in conſequence of his early diſappointment,
now ſaw with concern that his attachment to
Celeſtina, though it prevented his marrying
any other, was yet ſo rooted in his heart,
that ſhould he find, as ſhe believed he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0206900203:258"/>
would, the imagined relationſhip a mere
fiction, he would moſt undoubtedly return
to her with more ardour than before they
were parted: and notwithſtanding the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed
ſtate of his affairs, which every
day became more ſerious, would marry her,
and diſappoint every view of fortune—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of fortune—which her avaricious am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
foreſaw might otherwiſe accrue to
her.</p>
            <p>Actuated, therefore, by very different
motives, ſhe co-operated with Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north
in endeavouring to divide him from
Celeſtina; and while one was ſtrengthening
the barrier raiſed between them, the other
was trying to convince Willoughby that he
ought not to wiſh for it's removal.</p>
            <p>The means of doing this were, ſhe
thought, to keep him at a diſtance from
Celeſtina, and to pique his pride by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
her as attached to another. The
firſt point was for the preſent ſecured by his
illneſs; and ſhe took care ſo artfully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
the ſecond, that aided as ſhe was by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0206900203:259"/>
the report of Vavaſour, and by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
repetitions of what he had ſeen on the
journey from Scotland, that every hour the
fatal impreſſion ſunk, deeper into his heart,
and his reaſon, or his reliance on Celeſtina's
affection, had not ſufficient power to reſiſt
it.</p>
            <p>Thus paſſed five or ſix days after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
in London. He endeavoured to ſhake
off his illneſs; for by a journey into York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
which he could not till it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
undertake, he could alone hope to
obtain any ſatisfaction as to the original
cauſe of their ſeparation. Yet even from
thence he now no longer dared to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to happineſs, which even while he
was employed in attempting to regain it,
ſeemed eſcaping from him for ever.</p>
            <p>But that he might undertake ſomething
to relieve himſelf from the wretched ſtate
he was now in, he put himſelf into the care
of a phyſician, and ſet about getting out of
an illneſs he had hitherto neglected or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indulged. Though very languid, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0206900203:260"/>
with a great deal of fever ſtill about him,
he went to Lady Molyneux's; and in a
day or two afterwards, as he found himſelf
better from change of ſcene and of place,
he accompanied her on ſome of her viſits,
and called in at a card party, where ſhe
told him ſhe muſt ſhew herſelf for a quarter
of an hour. The rooms were full; and
Lady Molyneux being, notwithſtanding her
declaration that ſhe ſhould ſtay ſo ſhort a
time, ſet down to a card table, Willoughby
ſauntered into one of the apartments where
the younger part of the company were
ſeated at a commerce table; where the firſt
perſon that met his eyes was Celeſtina, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
dreſſed and more beautiful than ever,
with myriads of charms playing round her
face, and cheerfulneſs and pleaſure dancing
in her eyes; while on one ſide ſat a young
man whom Willoughby immediately recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to be Montague Thorold, and on
the other another gentleman, who, though
he ſeemed to be more a ſtranger to her, was
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0206900203:261"/>
evidently charmed with her, and unable to
keep his eyes from her face.</p>
            <p>Fixed to the place where he ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded
among ſome other idle people who
were looking on, he remained gazing at
her for ſeveral minutes. His legs trembled
ſo that it was with difficulty he ſupported
himſelf, and his heart beat as if it would
break. He debated with himſelf whether
he ſhould ſpeak to her, or retire unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
but while he yet argued the point,
a ſmile and a whiſper that paſſed between
her and Montague Thorold determined
him to fly from the torments he felt, and
which he found it almoſt impoſſible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
another moment: he ſtepped haſtily
away to find his ſiſter and entreat her to
go; but ſo deeply was he affected, that,
weakened as he was by illneſs, he ſtaggered,
and might have fallen, had not the ſhame
of betraying ſo much weakneſs lent him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to reach a chair, where he ſat a
moment to recover breath and recollection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0206900203:262"/>
Mortified tenderneſs and diſappointed
love gave him for an inſtant a ſenſation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
hatred. He fancied he could
quit Celeſtina never again to feel any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in her fate; but, leaving her to the
man ſhe preferred, ſtrengthen himſelf
againſt his fatal and till now invincible
attachment, by contemplating the fatal
barrier which he had ſo long been try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deſtroy, and to believe that artifice
rather than nature had placed between them.
Of this cauſe of their ſeparation, no part
had in fact been removed; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
himſelf for the abſurdity, folly,
and even vice of his preſent conduct. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
argued himſelf into what he thought a
reſolution to feel no longer for Celeſtina,
he hurried to Lady Molyneux, and told
her, that if her game was not nearly at an
end, he muſt leave her and go home in a
chair, as he found himſelf unable to bear
the heat of the room.</p>
            <p>His ſiſter anſwered, that ſhe was only
ſettling her winnings, and would attend
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0206900203:263"/>
him in a moment if he would wait for her.
He agreed to do ſo, and going to the door
that led out of that into the next room, he
leaned againſt the ſide of it, turning his
eyes as much as poſſible from the apartment
where Celeſtina was.</p>
            <p>Loſt in the painful ſenſations inflicted by
diſtracting jealouſy and bitter regret, which
he yet ſtruggled to ſtiſle, he diſtinguiſhed
not the objects: all, to him, unintereſting
that moved before him. A croud of young
people, however, who had juſt riſen from
their table, were preſſing into another
room where refreſhments were diſtributed.
He moved a little to make way for them,
when he ſaw, cloſe to him, and even borne
againſt him by her companions, Celeſtina
herſelf. Her face was at firſt turned from
him; for ſhe was ſpeaking to Montague
Thorold, who was on the other ſide; but
finding herſelf crouding againſt ſomebody,
ſhe turned to apologiſe for the rudeneſs ſhe
was guilty of, when the well known figure,
the well known face of Willoughby, ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0206900203:264"/>
and pale as they were, inſtantly
ſtruck her. An involuntary and faint
ſhriek teſtified the impreſſion they made;
and Willoughby, who caught the weak
ſound of her diſtreſsful voice, was at firſt,
by an irreſiſtible impulſe, hurried to her
aſſiſtance; but ſeeing the arm of Montague
Thorold ſupporting her, and his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
expreſſing all the intereſt he took in
her emotion, heimputed that emotion to her
conſciouſneſs of her attachment to her new
favourite; and darting at her a look of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
reproach, he forced himſelf through
the croud, and without looking back, ſat
down breathleſs and trembling by Lady
Molyneux, who was that moment coming
forward to meet him.</p>
            <p>The agitation of poor Celeſtina could not
be concealed, nor could ſhe for a moment
or two eſcape from the enquiring eyes of
thoſe who remarked it. As ſoon, however,
as ſhe could diſengage herſelf from the
throng, ſhe ſat down, hardly daring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether what ſhe had ſeen was real or
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0206900203:265"/>
viſionary. She had returned from Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire
with Lady Horatia only the evening
before, and knew nothing of Willoughby's
being in England; while, in addition to
the amazement the ſight of him occaſioned,
his apparent ill health impreſſed her with
concern, and the diſpleaſure with which he
ſurveyed her, with terror.</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, who had ſeen Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
and whoſe eyes were never a
moment away from Celeſtina, knew at once
the cauſe of her diſtreſs. He followed her,
little leſs affected than ſhe was herſelf, to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha
where ſhe had thrown herſelf, and aſked
her, in a faint and tremulous voice, if he
ſhould fetch her any thing? ſhe anſwered
"if you pleaſe," ſo low that he ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
what ſhe ſaid; but ſtepping a
few paces from her, he took a glaſs of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monade
from a ſervant and brought it to
her. She took it, and carried it to her
lips, almoſt unconſcious of what ſhe did,
while Montague Thorold leaned over the
arm of the ſopha on which ſhe ſat, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0206900203:266"/>
watched the emotions of <hi>her</hi> countenance,
with all the ſolicitude he felt ſtrongly
painted on his own.</p>
            <p>At the ſame moment Willoughby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
leading Lady Molyneux through
the room. The firſt objects that he ſaw as
he approached the door, were Celeſtina and
Montague Thorold: but having once ſeen
them, he turned haſtily from them; and
ſeeming to give all his attention to his ſiſter,
he diſappeared.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina's eyes followed him with a look
of inexpreſſible amazement and concern.
She ſeemed to be in a fearful dream; and
when ſhe no longer ſaw him, her eyes were
fixed on the door through which he had
gone out. She heeded no longer what
Montague Thorold ſaid to her; but ſat,
with a palpitating heart and oppreſſed
breath, till Lady Horatia, after twice
ſpeaking to her, rouſed her from her half
formed and confuſed reflections by remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her it was time to go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0206900203:267"/>
She followed, in ſilence, where Lady
Horatia led, and at the coach door wiſhed
Montague Thorold good night; for the
only diſtinct ſenſation ſhe felt, was a wiſh
for his abſence: but Lady Horatia, who
was immediately going home, deſired him
to return and ſup with her; which, without
knowing what he did, he conſented to,
though too conſcious while he did it that
Celeſtina had rather be without him, for as
he handed her into the coach, he felt her
tremble ſo that ſhe could hardly ſupport
herſelf, and he heard the deep ſigh burſt
from her heart as if it would break.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia had not ſeen Willoughby,
and had no idea of Celeſtina's ſufferings.
She talked therefore in her uſual way of the
people they had ſeen, and of ſome books
that had been recommended to her; till
obſerving that Celeſtina, who uſually bore
her part in the converſation, did not anſwer,
ſhe enquired if ſhe was not well?</p>
            <p>"Pretty well, I thank your Ladyſhip,"
replied Celeſtina; "but I am uncommonly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0206900203:268"/>
fatigued to-night, and have the head ach."
This anſwer ſatisfied Lady Horatia, who
continued to addreſs herſelf to Montague
Thorold, till they arrived in Park-ſtreet;
where Celeſtina would immediately have
gone to her own room, ſo unfit was ſhe for
converſation and ſo unable to ſuſtain it;
but Lady Horatia ordering her woman to
bring a remedy for the head ach, of which
Celeſtina had complained, and that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been of ſervice to her, ſhe, rather than
alarm her kind benefactreſs, ſat down near
the ſupper table to wait for it.</p>
            <p>But ſo great an effect had the violent
though ſhort perturbation of her ſpirits had
on her countenance, that Lady Horatia
immediately perceived it. "The head
ach!" cried ſhe in ſurpriſe, and taking Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina's
hand: "my dear, you have ſurely
ſomething worſe the matter with you than a
common head ach"</p>
            <p>"Pray, deareſt Madam," replied Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
"pardon me if I am utterly unable
to ſay what is the matter. To-morrow I
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0206900203:269"/>
ſhall be better, and I know you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me till then."</p>
            <p>The manner in which ſhe uttered theſe
few words, as, trembling and faint, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards the door, alarmed and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
Lady Horatia. She ſaw, however,
by the countenance of Montague Thorold,
that he could explain the cauſe of Celeſtina's
uneaſineſs; ſhe therefore ſuffered her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and immediately made the enquiry of
him.</p>
            <p>He inſtantly informed her of what he had
ſeen; and with no favourable deſcription of
the looks and manner of Willoughby,
which had indeed appeared to him to be
extremely cruel and inſulting towards Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina.
Lady Horatia, with whom Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
was no favourite, and who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
diſliked his ſiſter Lady Molyneux,
ſaw his conduct in the ſame point of view
as Thorold repreſented it; and, after ſome
converſation on the ſubject, ſaid, that
though ſhe was much concerned for the
ſhock Celeſtina had received, yet that upon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0206900203:270"/>
the whole it might perhaps be better for
her that this circumſtance had happened.
"For now," ſaid ſhe, "I think ſhe will,
poſſeſſing, as ſhe does, ſo much proper
pride, be convinced, that even if the ſtory
coming from Lady Caſtlenorth has no
foundation, as I myſelf ſuppoſe it has, that
ſtill ſhe ought not to indulge her early pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
in favour of a man, who, whatever
<hi>he</hi> may have pretended or <hi>ſhe</hi> may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
never intended to act honourably
by her, and now not only deſerts but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
her."</p>
            <p>Thorold heartily aſſented to this opinion,
and ſat down to ſupper with a heart ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
relieved from the extreme uneaſineſs
which the emotion of Celeſtina on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Willoughby had given him.
Still, however, he could not eat, he could
not converſe; but as ſoon as he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
himſelf, he took leave of Lady
Horatia, and full of anxiety, and trembling
leaſt all the hopes he had of late ſo fondly
cheriſhed ſhould be blaſted, he returned to
his lodgings.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
            <p>CELESTINA, in retiring to her own
room, had hoped to recall her ſcattered and
oppreſſed ſpirits, and clearly recollect all
that had befallen her; but the angry, the
diſdainful look which that countenance
wore where ſhe had been accuſtomed to ſee
only the ſmiles of approbation or the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
anxious looks of love, was the image
ſtill moſt prevalent in her mind, joined to
the painful idea of the ruined conſtitution
of him whoſe life was ever dearer to her
than her own.</p>
            <p>The cruelty of his being in London, of
his going into public without ever having
ſeen or wrote to her, ſunk deeply into her
heart. "Ah! Willoughby," exclaimed
ſhe, "is it thus we meet again after ſuch
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0206900203:272"/>
a parting? Is this the end of all your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances,
that you would ever be my friend?
that you would learn to conſider me as your
ſiſter if we were indeed related? alas! is it
thus then you throw me off entirely, and
ſeem ſorry to remember that you ever ſaw
me?" A flood of tears followed this cruel
reflection; but after weeping ſome time,
her pride came to her relief: ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
the haughty neglect with which Lady
Molyneux had treated her, and doubted
not but that her influence with Willoughby
had prevailed on him to expel her for ever
from that place in his regard which the
very reaſons on which he reſigned her as
his wife, ought to give her as a defenceleſs
and unhappy orphan, dependent on his
family. She recollected now but too well
the reſerve and diſdain, the look of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
anger and ſcorn, which Willoughby's
features ſpoke as ſhe ſaw him the ſecond
time leading out his ſiſter; and her mind
dwelt on the expreſſion of his eyes as they
firſt met her's; when, though he muſt have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:0206900203:273"/>
ſeen how much ſhe was ſurpriſed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the ſight of him, he flew from
her without one conſoling word, though it
was evident ſhe could hardly ſupport her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>"All is over then," cried ſhe: "that
tender friendſhip which would have been
the conſolation of my life, is at an end.
Every tie that from our infancy united us
is broken, and I have now no reliance but
on the kindneſs of thoſe who are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
ſtrangers. Ah! is it generous thus
to diſcard me, without even trying to
ſoften the blow: but go, cruel, capricious
man, go, and enjoy, with your opulent
heireſs, all that affluence can give: go, and
become callous and inſenſible to all thoſe
noble ſentiments that once animated your
boſom, which once rendered you ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
dear to me. They are gone. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
ſelfiſh, cruel, unfeeling, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
is not the Willoughby to whom my
heartwas devoted. Why therefore ſhould I
be thus wretched about him? why let his
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0206900203:274"/>
proud malignant ſiſter triumph in knowing
that I am mortified and unhappy. Let me
try to drive his too painful remembrance
from me; or at leaſt to remember him only
as the ſon of my beloved benefactreſs."</p>
            <p>At the mention of that revered name,
however, all her newly acquired reſolution
forſook her. The memory of her tender,
her firſt friend, was ſo intimately connected
with that of Willoughby himſelf, that her
tears flowed for both; and againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs
of the latter neither her pride nor
her reaſon could ſuſtain her.</p>
            <p>A ſleepleſs night ſucceeded to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
evening; and it was not till towards
morning that Celeſtina determined to write
to Willoughby, entreating him ſtill to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her that place in his friendſhip, which
no fault of her's had, ſhe thought, forfeited,
and aſſuring him that whatever might be
her deſtiny her regard for him was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
though ſhe would never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
upon him with it. Her tenderneſs
conquered her reſentment, and the idea of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0206900203:275"/>
what ſhe owed to the ſon of her early friend,
whatever might be his conduct towards her,
came in aid of that long rooted tenderneſs,
and produced the reſolution which ſhe
meant to execute in the morning. Having
thus determined, her mind gradually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more tranquil, and her ſpirits being
quite exhauſted, ſhe ſunk into ſlumber.</p>
            <p>But the fainter though ſtill painful ideas
of the evening before purſued her; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tormenting her with numberleſs wild
terrors, ſhe fancied that ſhe ſaw Willoughby
with the ſame menacing look he wore the
preceding night, with a dagger in his hand,
approaching and threatening her to plunge
it into a heart, which was, he ſaid, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and ungrateful, and had been the
means of driving him to guilt and deſpair.</p>
            <p>From an image of ſuch horror ſhe wildly
ſtarted; and awaking, found Lady Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
Howard ſitting by her bed ſide, holding
one of her hands, and gazing on her with
great concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0206900203:276"/>
With the moſt ſoothing voice ſhe ſpoke
to Celeſtina, and endeavoured to quiet the
exceſſive agitation of her ſpirits. Her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and gentle arguments had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
effect; and Celeſtina, aſhamed of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
inſenſible to the ſolicitude of ſuch
a friend, ſummoned all her reſolution to
her aid, and was able in about an hour to
attend the breakfaſt table with ſomething
like compoſure. Her cheeks, however,
had ſtill that crimſon glow which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
ſtate of her mind had given them:
her eyes were heavy with tears, which in
deſpite of all her efforts continued to fill
them when the image of Willoughby, pale
and thin, with anger flaſhing from his eyes,
and contempt trembling on his lips, again
aroſe in her imagination. Lady Horatia
looked at her with more than her uſual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
complacency; for it was when her fine
open countenance expreſſed penſive ſorrow,
that ſhe was, from her then particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the regretted brother of Lady
Horatia, to her more than uſually intereſting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0206900203:277"/>
Before the breakfaſt table was removed,
Montague Thorold was introduced. He
was extremely dejected; and hardly able to
return the compliments of Lady Horatia,
who was always glad to ſee him, and who
had undoubtedly given him all her intereſt
with Celeſtina, and more encouragement to
purſue his ſuit than was perhaps ſtrictly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
ſince Celeſtina, though ſhe could not
avoid him, though ſhe never could prevail
upon herſelf to behave to him with unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and though his talents and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and perhaps that ſort of reſpectful
idolatry by which few women can help be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gratified however they may wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it, were, in ſome degree, pleaſing to
her, had yet repeatedly declared to Lady
Horatia and to Montague Thorold himſelf,
that ſhe felt not, and was perſuaded ſhe never
ſhould feel for him, that tender preference,
without which ſhe never would marry.
This declaration they both imputed to that
affection for Willoughby, which the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0206900203:278"/>
of her own ſituation continued to
nouriſh. Perſuaded as they both were, that
Willoughby had promiſed to become the
huſband of Miſs Fitz Hayman, which every
body but Celeſtina had long believed,
Lady Horatia doubted not but that the
merit and attachment of Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
the ſimilarity of their taſte, Celeſtina's
regard for his father, and the eaſy compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which with him ſhe could poſſeſs and
which ſhe often declared was the condition
of life ſhe would prefer, would altogether
induce her to reward his ardent affection
with her hand, as ſoon as it became certain
that Willoughby, either from intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
or from conviction of their too near
relationſhip, abſolutely and for ever relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
all pretenſions to it. She was,
therefore, glad that the accidental meeting
which had ſo much affected Celeſtina was
likely to haſten this period; and far from
ſeeing it in the unfavourable light Thorold
himſelf did, ſhe told him, as ſoon as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0206900203:279"/>
left the room, that for him no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
could be more favourable.</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia had long ſince transferred
entirely to Montague Thorold thoſe good
wiſhes which ſhe had at firſt expreſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Vavaſour. His great fortune, his
handſome figure, and his apparent affection
for Celeſtina, had for ſome time intereſted
her for him; and ſhe imputed his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
vivacity, and even his violent irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
to his youth and unchecked habits
of gratification. Before her, Vavaſour had
at firſt ſo far reſtrained the intemperate ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of his ungovernable temper, that ſhe
was for ſome time diſpoſed to think well of
his heart and his underſtanding: but ſoon
finding that this ſemblance of moderation
availed him not, and that he gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on the inflexible heart of Celeſtina, he
became tired of it, and relapſed into ſuch a
wild way of talking, and of boaſting of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſtill wilder, that Lady Horatia was no
longer able to excuſe him; and though ſhe
ſtill received him at her houſe with civility,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0206900203:280"/>
ſhe entirely approved of the reſolution Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
had made never to liſten to him as a
lover.</p>
            <p>It was juſt at that period that Montague
Thorold, who on Celeſtina's firſt arrival in
town had not availed himſelf of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
he had obtained to ſee her, came
to ſolicit of Lady Horatia that indulgence,
and accounted for his abſence by relating a
long illneſs his father had juſt eſcaped; in
which, as Mrs. Thorold was abſent with
one of her daughters, he had himſelf been
his only and conſtant attendant. "You
know," ſaid he to Celeſtina, "how much I
love my father, and how well he deſerves
that I ſhould love him; and you will eaſily
imagine what muſt have been my anxiety,
when, for ſo many nights and days, I ſaw
him experience the moſt excruciating tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and knew his life to be in the moſt
imminent danger. Even the reigning, the
triumphant paſſion of my heart—my love,
my adoration of Celeſtina, was ſuſpended,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0206900203:281"/>
in the pain and ſolicitude I ſuffered for my
father."</p>
            <p>His looks, which were greatly changed
ſince Celeſtina ſaw him before, witneſſed
how ſevere this pain and ſolicitude had
been; and Celeſtina not only forgave, but
eſteemed him the more for that neglect,
which had at firſt given her a ſlight degree
of mortification. From that time he had
conſtantly viſited at the houſe of Lady Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia,
and from his power of amuſing her
by reading and converſation, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo great a favourite, that he had no
rival in her good opinion but Celeſtina her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
It was at her requeſt he had met
them at Oxford, and gone with them to
Bath and Briſtol. Celeſtina, who ſaw but
too plainly that all this was but feeding a
paſſion already fatal to the repoſe of a
young man whom ſhe highly eſteemed, had
in vain remonſtrated with Lady Horatia on
the ſubject; who anſwered, that <hi>her</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
was a ſufficient protection, and that as
to his love, he would not indulge it the leſs
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0206900203:282"/>
for being refuſed the opportunity of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. To this doctrine Celeſtina could
not aſſent; but, in her ſituation, to diffent
was of little effect; and all ſhe could do to
counteract the effects of this indiſcreet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
of Lady Horatia towards Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
Thorold, was, to declare to him very
ſolemnly, whenever he introduced the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his love, which was whenever they
were alone, that though her eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
for him were very great, ſhe never
could think of him otherwiſe than as
her friend: and when he anſwered, that
content with that eſteem and regard he
ſhould be the happieſt of mankind to be
permitted by time and tenderneſs to win her
love, ſhe very frankly aſſured him, that the
ſentiments which were once her's for Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
though towards him they might
be at an end, could never, ſhe was well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
be transferred to another.</p>
            <p>Montague Thorold, however, young,
ſanguine, and violently in love, was not
eaſily diſcouraged; while the favour of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0206900203:283"/>
Lady Horatia, the wiſhes of his father, and
the complacency and kindneſs with which,
notwithſtanding her repeated declarations,
Celeſtina treated him, all contributed to
cheriſh a paſſion which inſenſibly abſorbed
his whole ſoul. Every action, every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
every look of Celeſtina, at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
and juſtified this exceſſive paſſion;
and he lived now only to think of her when
he was abſent, or gaze on her with adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when ſhe was preſent. Whenever he
knew ſhe was to be at any public place, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
which he was very aſſiduous and
very ſucceſsful in obtaining,) thither he
went alſo; and though, unleſs he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited,
he never introduced himſelf into the
parties ſhe was with, he contrived ſo to
place himſelf as to be able to ſee her, and
was content.</p>
            <p>The extreme dejection with which he had
on the laſt morning entered the houſe of
Lady Horatia, all fled before her aſſurances
that the meeting between Willoughby and
Celeſtina, however ſhe might for a little
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0206900203:284"/>
time be affected by it, would prove of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to him. Elated more than ever by
hope, he left Lady Horatia, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
leave to meet them at the opera,
whither they were going that evening.</p>
            <p>But with poor Celeſtina it was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
hope had now wholly forſaken her,
yet ſtill ſhe clung even to deſpair, when it
gave her an excuſe for dwelling on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
and regretted name of Willoughby.</p>
            <p>She took out of her dreſſing box a locket,
in which his hair was interwoven with that
of his mother and of his ſiſter, and which
ſhe had been uſed when a child to wear
round her neck. She looked at it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and remembered a thouſand cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that brought the tears again
into her eyes. She kiſſed it; ſhe put it to
her heart; and that ſoft heart melting at the
tender images this ſlight memorial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to it, the reſentment which her pride
had made her feel the evening before was
forgotten; while, unable to bear the thoughts
of having ſeen the laſt of Willoughby, of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0206900203:285"/>
his having taken an accidental but eternal
leave of her with anger and ſcorn, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
inſtantly to execute her purpoſe
formed the evening before, and with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and uncertain hand wrote as follows:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <p>Do not think, dear Willoughby, that
the unfortunate Celeſtina means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade
upon you with her complaints, or
to trouble you, after the preſent moment,
with even her name. But when thoſe
recollections which ſhe cannot all at
once ſubdue preſs upon her heart, ſhe
finds it impoſſible, quite impoſſible, to
ſubmit to take of you an eternal farewel,
without entreating, that though we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meet again, we may part in peace
with each other.</p>
                  <p>I might indeed urge to you, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
that if the account you gave
me of our ſuppoſed relationſhip be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized,
it ought not to excite your anger,
but to give me a claim to your protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If my heart did not, I know not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0206900203:286"/>
why, revolt from the idea of being ſo
nearly your relation, I might on that
ſcore claim your protection and your
pity; I might be permitted ſurely to
love you as my brother, ſince, alas! whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you permit it or no, I muſt ſtill
love you—but with an affection ſo diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
and pure, that, be my ſituation
in regard to you what it may, I feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for which I ought to bluſh.</p>
                  <p>You look very ill, Willoughby. You
look unhappy: and on me you looked
unkindly. I do not aſk to ſee you, ſince
my accidentally meeting you was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
painful to you; but I aſk to have
a few lines from you to tell me that you
are not ill, that you are not unhappy,
and that your once loved Celeſtina is
not become hateful to you. Believe me,
I ſhall rejoice in your happineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
found. Do not then refuſe to aſſiſt
me in obtaining—not happineſs, for that
is no where to be found for me—but in
obtaining that degree of content and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0206900203:287"/>
which may enable me to go
through life without regretting the hour
that I ever received it. This, Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
is in your power, and you muſt be
greatly changed indeed if you refuſe,
when you can ſo eaſily grant the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
that ever will be preferred to you,
by the unhappy, but ever grateful and
affectionate</p>

            <p>Though by no means ſatisfied with her
letter when ſhe had finiſhed it, ſhe deſpaired
of pleaſing herſelf better. She therefore
ſealed and ſent it away by one of the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to the houſe of Lady Molyneux, as
ſhe knew no other addreſs to Willoughby.
The ſervant returned in about half an hour,
and told her that Mr. Willoughby was not
there, but that he had ſent in the letter and
received a meſſage that it ſhould be taken
care of and delivered to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0206900203:288"/>
She had flattered herſelf that if not a
kind, at leaſt an immediate anſwer would
put an end to that almoſt inſupportable
ſtate of anxiety which ſhe had been in ever
ſince ſhe ſaw him. If he wrote to her with
kindneſs, it would, ſhe thought, ſoothe and
conſole her: if he treated her by letter with
as much coldneſs and diſdain as he did dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſhort interview, ſhe hoped that
reſentment would ſupport her: and that
though her pride might be wounded, her
affection would torment her leſs.</p>
            <p>She was now, however, to wait—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a whole day in anxiety; and, what was
more dreadful, be compelled to ſuſtain this
anxiety under the appearance of calmneſs
if not of cheerfulneſs; for Lady Horatia,
who had made an engagement with ſome of
her friends to go to the opera, whither ſhe
ſeldom went herſelf, on purpoſe to gratify
Celeſtina by hearing a new and celebrated
performer, did not ſeem at all diſpoſed to
reliſh the propoſal ſhe had ventured to hint
at breakfaſt, of being left out of the party
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0206900203:289"/>
of the evening: and though ſhe was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
very deſirous that Celeſtina ſhould in
all ſuch matters follow her own inclinations,
yet there were times when ſhe ſeemed to
expect ſome ſacrifices to be made to her.</p>
            <p>Her grateful heart was extremely ſenſible
of all the kindneſs of Lady Horatia; who,
from having taken her into her protection
quite a ſtranger, was now ſo attached to
her that her happineſs ſeemed her firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Having no very ſtrong affection for
her only ſurviving brother, who was a man
immerſed in politics and without pretence
to natural affection; and having been torn
early in life from a man ſhe loved, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by her father to one towards whom ſhe
was indifferent; having ſince followed her
three children, who alone had reconciled
her to her lot, to their early graves; her
heart had become inſenſible to what are
commonly called friendſhips, and ſhe had
for ſome years rather ſought to amuſe than
to connect herſelf. But the graces of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina's
mind, the ſweetneſs of her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0206900203:290"/>
and the goodneſs of her heart, had ſo
won upon her, that the apathy of wearied
ſenſibility, which ſhe had ſo long been in,
gradually gave place to an affection almoſt
as tender as ſhe could have felt had ſhe been
her mother; and this affection, created by
merit, was ſtrengthened by the reſemblance
which continually ſtruck her between Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina
and her younger brother, who loſt his
life in America, the loſs, which, among all
her misfortunes, ſhe moſt ſeverely lamented.</p>
            <p>Her encreaſing tenderneſs for Celeſtina,
made her often reflect with uneaſineſs on
her ſituation, and very earneſtly wiſh to ſee
her married. She was very ſenſible that her
own life was not a good one; for early ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
had ſhaken her conſtitution and
brought on in the early autumn of her days
the infirmities of old age; and ſhe knew,
that after having taken her as her daughter,
and accuſtomed her to ſhare all the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
which her own rank and income
procured, it would be a very painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of fortune were ſhe to leave her in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0206900203:291"/>
narrow circumſtances in which ſhe found
her. To ſave much out of her jointure had
never been her wiſh, and was hardly now
in her power. Her own fortune, in default
of children, returned to her brother; and
all ſhe had to diſpoſe of was about two
thouſand pounds. This ſhe gave, by a will
made in the fourth month of their being
together, to Celeſtina; and with this, and
what ſhe before had, ſhe thought that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina
might, if married to Montague Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,
enjoy through life that eaſy compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which was the utmoſt of her ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The embarraſſed circumſtances of
Willoughby, which the good natured world
had always exaggerated, and which Lady
Horatia had conſidered as irretrievable; his
very expenſive place at Alveſtone, which
ſhe knew it required a large fortune to keep
up; the doubtful birth of Celeſtina, whom
ſhe always fancied too nearly related to
him; and ſome prejudice againſt him,
merely becauſe he was the brother of Lady
Molyneux, whom ſhe ſo very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0206900203:292"/>
all combined to raiſe in the mind of
Lady Horatia a deſire to impede every
ſtep towards the re-union of Celeſtina and
Willoughby, and to promote her alliance
with Montague Thorold, near whoſe reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
wherever it was, ſhe propoſed to
take a houſe in ſummer, and to have them
frequently with her in winter at her houſe
in town.</p>
            <p>Though ſhe had not diſcloſed all her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
Celeſtina yet knew enough to be
deeply ſenſible of the uncommon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
of her friend, and the whole ſtudy of
her life was to ſhew that ſhe was ſo. She
made it a rule never to oppoſe the wiſhes of
Lady Horatia whenever they were clearly
expreſſed; and therefore it was that ſhe had
often, contrary to her own judgment and
to her own inclinations, ſuffered the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities
of Montague Thorold; and ſeemed
to the world to give him that encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ill effects of which ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to counteract, by ingenuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
to him the impoſſibility of her ever
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0206900203:293"/>
making the return he expected to his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Too certain that Lady Horatia would be
diſappointed if not diſpleaſed if ſhe declined
on this evening to go out, and not having
courage to tell her the ſtep ſhe had taken
in regard to writing to Willoughby, ſhe
was compelled to ſtruggle with her uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to attempt concealing if ſhe could
not conquer it: but every rap at the door
which ſeemed to be that of a ſervant, made
her tremble; and while ſitting at work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dinner, ſhe could not help going to
the window ſeveral times, nor liſtening to
every ſound that ſhe heard in the hall.
Time wore away, and her impatience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and at length grew ſo evident that
Lady Horatia remarked it. "What is
the matter, my dear?" enquired ſhe: "do
you expect any one?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, conſcious that ſhe was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
herſelf, and fearing leaſt ſhe ſhould be
blamed for what ſhe had done, of which ſhe
began already to repent as too humiliating,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0206900203:294"/>
bluſhed at this queſtion ſo deeply, that had
not Lady Horatia been intent at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on her work, her ſuſpicions muſt have
been heightened. Celeſtina, however, not
immediately anſwering, ſhe repeated her
queſtion—"do you expect any body?"
Twenty reaſons might have been given for
her ſeeming anxiety, and twenty people
might have been named as likely to call;
but not one of all theſe occurred to Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,
who was little practiſed in diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
ſhe therefore anſwered faintly, "no;"
and in hopes of turning Lady Horatia's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
from her, and of hiding what ſhe
felt, ſhe propoſed finiſhing the peruſal of a
poem which Montague Thorold had began
to read the preceding morning.</p>
            <p>"Do ſo," ſaid Lady Horatia.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina took up the book and began;
but had no idea of what ſhe was about, and
of courſe read ſo extremely ill, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
her uſual manner, that Lady Horatia,
looking at her very earneſtly, ſaid "Surely,
Celeſtina—ſurely ſomething is the matter?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0206900203:295"/>
"No, indeed, Madam," replied ſhe,
"nothing except perhaps ſome ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of nervous agitation, from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of laſt night."</p>
            <p>"Try, my dear, to conquer that," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Lady Horatia, "and think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
the compoſure you poſſeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
which ſuch a circumſtance, fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
ought not to deſtroy."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina ſighed; and to avoid the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of giving an anſwer, went on with
the book before her. She had hardly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
read ten lines, when a ſervant brought
in a letter and gave it her. She turned paler
than death as ſhe took it, and the book fell
from her hands.</p>
            <p>Lady Horaria, whoſe attention was now
fixed upon her, eagerly aſked from whom
was the letter. Celeſtina had by this time
read it; for it was only a note from a young
friend, for whoſe painting ſhe had promiſed
to give ſome pattern. She put it down:
"It is only from Miſs Clayton, Madam,"
ſaid ſhe, "about the patterns I am drawing
for her."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:0206900203:296"/>
"Dear child," cried Lady Horatia, "and
is all this trembling and anxiety, this faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and ſolicitude, about Miſs Clayton's
patterns? Celeſtina, I am afraid you are
not ingenuous with me. Surely I deſerve
that you ſhould be ſo?"</p>
            <p>Celeſtina felt that this accuſation, of want
of confidence, and the claim made to it,
were equally juſt. The meaſure ſhe had
adopted, at the riſque of diſpleaſing her
beſt friend, had produced nothing but
ſome hours of anguiſh, and would end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
in the conviction that Willoughby
deſpiſed and contemned her: for it was
now five o'clock; and it was very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he ſhould not, in all the hours
that had intervened ſince ſhe wrote, have
been at his lodgings, or have had time to
acknowledge the receipt of her letter. This
mortifying reflection, and the conſciouſneſs
that ſhe ought to have conſulted Lady Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratia,
quite overwhelmed her. She was
pale and ſilent a moment; and then reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
her voice, with difficulty ſaid—"I
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0206900203:297"/>
believe I have acted ſo fooliſhly, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
that I hardly dare hope you will
forgive me."</p>
            <p>Lady Horatia expreſſing her uneaſineſs
and ſurpriſe, Celeſtina, in a tremulous
voice, told her what ſhe had done. Pity
rather than anger was created by the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
"Certainly, my dear child," ſaid
Lady Horatia, "had you conſulted me, I
ſhould have adviſed you againſt writing to
Mr. Willoughby. Situated as you both
are, no advances ſhould have come from
you. If he is convinced that you are ſo
related to him as to make every thought of
you, beyond ſuch as that relationſhip autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,
guilty and odious, he ſhould ſurely,
on his coming to England, have ſent to
you if he was unwilling to ſee you, and
have behaved with humanity and brotherly,
tenderneſs, though love were for ever out
of the queſtion: if he is not convinced of
it, how will you account for his conduct,
but by ſuppoſing, that, influenced by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary
motives or by caprice, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0206900203:298"/>
of forgetting all his former affection
for you, and yet has not that generous
openneſs of character which would urge
him to quit you handſomely."</p>
            <p>To the truth of theſe remarks Celeſtina
had nothing to object; but their juſtice
cruelly depreſſed her, and her ſick heart
recoiled from the idea of being obliged to
appear in public. Again ſhe ventured ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gently to inſinuate a wiſh to be left at
home that evening. "If you are really
ill you ſhall," ſaid Lady Horatia; "but
otherwiſe I hope you will go."</p>
            <p>"I am not really ill," replied Celeſtina,
"if your Ladyſhip means only bodily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
but my ſpirits, my mind—"</p>
            <p>"For the maladies of thoſe," interrupted
Lady Horatia, "there is no remedy more
ſure than change of ſcene and variety of
amuſement; and believe me, dear Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina—believe
me, (and I have ſuffered
much from the maladies of the mind,) they
only grow by indulgence: if we would
conquer, we muſt contend with and not
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0206900203:299"/>
encourage them.—You will ſuffer much leſs
to-night, if you are in a circle of friends,
who love and admire you, than in brooding
at home over the defection of one, who, if
he ever did, certainly does not now deſerve
you.—I beg, therefore, that you will
go."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, unaccuſtomed to diſpute any
wiſh of her friend, yielded, with as good a
grace as ſhe could, to her remonſtrances;
and with a heavy and aching heart, went to
finiſh her dreſs.</p>
            <p>The hour of going out arrived; and
Celeſtina found Montague Thorold, and a
Mr. Howard, a relation of Lady Horatia's,
ready to attend them.—As there was no
eſcape, ſhe endeavoured to aſſume the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of tranquillity, and to talk with
them on indifferent matters: but the idea
that Willoughby had left London without
ſeeing her; or, being ſtill in it, diſdained to
anſwer her letter, and utterly refuſed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
her; hung ſo heavy on her heart, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0206900203:300"/>
ſhe could with difficulty ſupport herſelf;
while the protracted ſtate, in which ſhe had
been ſince the preceding evening, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
ſuch a ferment in her blood, that
her cheeks were of a feveriſh crimſon; and
the languid luſtre of her fine eyes never
appeared to greater advantage.—Deep ſighs,
which ſhe tried in vain to ſuppreſs, ſtole
from her heart; and Mr. Howard rallied
her upon them, with that ſort of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
wit, which is ſo uſual, and ſo irkſome,
where there is real uneaſineſs to contend
with: while Montague Thorold anſwered
every ſigh of hers, by one yet deeper of
his own; and watched every turn of her
countenance with trembling ſolicitude.—Lady
Horatia was to join another party at
the opera; and Celeſtina was in hopes,
that by obtaining a ſeat in one of the laſt
rows in the box, ſhe ſhould be excuſed
from the taſk of ſeeming to give any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
either to the performance, or the
people around her.—This, therefore, ſhe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0206900203:301"/>
contrived to do, and Montague Thorold
placed herſelf by her.</p>
            <p>Her thoughts were engroſſed wholly by
Willoughby—and by the cruelty of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to anſwer her letter. She ſaw not the
objects about her; ſhe attended not to the
humble and plaintive voice of Thorold,
who now and then ſpoke to her; when
Lady Horatia Howard turning to her,
bade her remark, that into the oppoſite box
had juſt entered Lady Caſtlenorth and her
daughter.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina inſtantly ſaw them, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
concluded, that Willoughby's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
towards her was owing to his being on
the point of marriage with Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hayman.—She
had hardly felt her heart
ſink under this cruel idea, before Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby
himſelf appeared; and Lady Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
making room for him, he ſat down
between her and her daughter.</p>
            <p>A look from the penetrating eyes of Lady
Horatia Howard made Celeſtina turn away
her head; but ſhe then met the anxious
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0206900203:302"/>
and enquiring eyes of Montague Thorold;
and again ſought refuge in looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the pit—hardly knowing where ſhe
was, and not daring again to truſt herſelf
with the ſight of the group placed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
oppoſite to her. Willoughby ſaw
her not; and after a while, her eyes, in
deſpite of the pain ſhe felt, ſought him
again.—His countenance did not wear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of bridal felicity—he was, ſhe
thought, paler and thinner than the night
before, and on his brow ſome corroſive ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſeemed to hang: but Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
gay and animated, talked to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly;
and both ſhe and her mother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to engroſs his attention by a flow
of converſation.—He liſtened to them—but
Celeſtina fancied, with more politeneſs than
pleaſure—He ſmiled; but ſhe thought his
ſmiles were the ſmiles of complaiſance, and
not of content. Still, however, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in public with them was enough
to convince her that his marriage was not
far off. Her heart ſunk at this ſad cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0206900203:303"/>
for though ſhe had long ſince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to wean her mind from the hopes
of ever being his, ſhe had ſtill too keen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections
of that time when it was the
firſt wiſh of both their hearts; and ſhe was
prepoſſeſſed with an idea, ſhe hardly knew
why, that with Miſs Fitz-Hayman, he
would be miſerable.</p>
            <p>That they had been parted by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Lady Caſtleworth, ſhe now more
than ever ſuſpected. But how Willoughby
could be cheated into ſuch a belief; and if
he was, why he ſhould entirely throw off,
as a relation, her whom, as the choſen
miſtreſs of his heart, he had ſo fondly
cheriſhed, ſhe could not comprehend; or
could ſhe in any way reconcile his conduct
with that manly and liberal ſpirit, which
had ſo eminently marked his character—As
ſhe gazed on his face, as on that of a
ſtranger—the huſband of Miſs Fitz-Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man—that
face which ſhe had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to contemplate with ſo much
tenderneſs; and when ſhe conſidered that,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0206900203:304"/>
loſt to her for ever, ſhe now dared no
longer look up to <hi>him</hi> as a friend, whom
ſhe had once hoped to find, through life,
her fond and generous protector, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
became too bitter; and had ſhe
not feared that her going out would have
attracted his eyes towards her; and known
that Montague Thorold would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
her, which ſhe deſired to avoid; ſhe
would have returned home—for her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
were almoſt inſupportable.</p>
            <p>She hoped, however, to eſcape without
his ſeeing her; and ſhrunk back as much
as ſhe could, pretending that her head-ache
made the light particularly uneaſy to her.
Montague Thorold, though knowing too
well the real ſource of her uneaſineſs was
yet as anxious as ſhe was that Willoughby
might not ſee her; and favoured her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
as much as he could.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of the opera, however,
Willoughby, who ſeemed very weary of his
ſeat, left it to ſpeak to ſomebody he ſaw in
the pit—Celeſtina ſaw him very near the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0206900203:305"/>
box where ſhe ſat; and became ſo faint
that ſhe was afraid ſhe muſt have ſunk from
her ſeat.—But her ſufferings ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
when, a moment afterwards, Mr.
Howard, who ſat next to her, called to
him; and got up to ſpeak to him.—In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
his queſtion, Willoughby turned
towards him—his eyes immediately fell on
Celeſtina, and Montague Thorold cloſe
beſide her.—An expreſſion of mingled
anger and ſcorn roſe inſtantly in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
he abruptly broke off his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with Mr. Howard, and walked away.—In
a moment Celeſtina ſaw him rejoin
Lady Caſtlenorth, and Miſs Fitz-Hayman.—She
ſaw him affect to enter into conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with them; but that it was all effort.
His eyes once or twice were turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, but immediately withdrawn as if
they had met a baſiliſk; and after a very
few minutes, ſhe ſaw, by his manner, that
he complained of the heat of the houſe,
pleaded indiſpoſition, and left them.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina, overwhelmed with ſenſations
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0206900203:306"/>
too much to be borne, began to think the
opera never would end; and that Lady
Horatia, who ſaw her diſtreſs, had never
before had ſo little compaſſion. At length
it was finiſhed; and as Montague Thorold
handed her to the coach, ſhe beſought him
not to ſtay ſupper, if Lady Horatia ſhould
aſk him; "for I muſt in that caſe ſtay,
you know, to entertain you, and really I
am ſo unwell, that it is cruelty to expect it
of me." Gratified by the power of obeying
her, even when her wiſhes were contrary to
his own; and full of hope that this laſt
ſtruggle, between her lingering love for
Willoughby, and the certainty of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left her for another, would terminate
in his own favour, Thorold promiſed to be
wholly governed by her, and took his leave
at the door.</p>
            <p>"Well, Celeſtina," ſaid Lady Horatia,
as ſoon as they were alone, "you are now,
I think, convinced that Willoughby is, like
moſt other men, capricious, and unfeeling.—What
was his conduct to-night, but the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0206900203:307"/>
moſt inſulting that it was poſſible to aſſume
and after receiving a letter too from you,
which you conſeſs was couched in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
and moſt ſubmiſſive terms, which,
as a gentleman, he ought to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
had you never had any claim what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
upon him.—I hope, and believe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that ſuch conduct will have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
effect—that of weaning you for ever
from that exceſſive partiality, which from
early prejudice you always appeared to me
to think it a merit to cheriſh. If he quitted
you, as he pretended, on account of the
doubts raiſed in his mind, by that ſorcereſs,
Lady Caſtlenorth, why does he not, thoſe
doubts being now certainties, own you as
his ſiſter, and become your protector as
relation? Why, if they are not aſcertained,
does he poorly ſhrink from the enquiry,
and evade, under ſuch paltry pretences,
the engagements which you would ſurely
releaſe: him from, if told that he no longer
wiſhed to accompliſh them."</p>
            <p>Celeſtina tried to ſpeak, but could not
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0206900203:308"/>
articulate; and Lady Horatia, whoſe indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt Willoughby ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
by indulgence, went on—"Let me
conjure you, then, my dear Celeſtina, to
exert that large ſhare of reaſon, with which
you are endowed; and, expelling from your
mind all that has paſſed, try to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to happier proſpects—to proſpects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded,
by doubt, and undarkened by the
gloomy apprehenſions of being deſpiſed by
the family of your huſband, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reproached as having embarraſſed his
fortune. Time and reaſon, the aſſiduous
tenderneſs of a man who really adores you,
will conquer all remains of regret; and you
will, by degrees, learn to think of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
and of all the events of your
early life, with the moſt perfect indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Celeſtina thought that was impoſſible—but
altogether unable to enter into the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
ſhe could only ſigh, and in a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous
voice intreat to be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
ſaying that, in the morning, ſhe ſhould
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0206900203:309"/>
have, ſhe hoped, more reſolution, and have
got the better of the agitation of her ſpirits.
Sleep, however, refuſed to viſit her—the
image of Willoughby, cruel and capricious
as he was, inceſſantly haunted her. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been long uſed to ſtudy his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ſhe underſtood all its expreſſions;
and when ſhe had courage to fix her eyes
on him, during the opera, no turn of it
eſcaped her: all the comfort ſhe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to herſelf from thoſe obſervations was,
believing that his attention to Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hayman
was forced; and that the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
with which ſhe herſelf was avoided,
aroſe, rather from ſome remains of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
than from total indifference. "Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,"
ſaid ſhe, "if he felt nothing for me,
he would not fly from me, but treat me
with polite indifference; or, with that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
and openneſs of heart which uſed to
be ſo natural to him; he would avow his
deſigns, and give his reaſons for them; for
he knows, that be his intentions or his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
what they may, I ſhall never reproach
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0206900203:310"/>
him; but, whatever I may feel for myſelf,
rejoice, if he can find happineſs."</p>
            <p>Thus, the real affection of her heart for
Willoughby, counteracted the effect of that
native pride and dignity of ſoul, which,
under other circumſtances, would have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
her; and even of his quitting her,
without finding that unanſwerable reaſon
for it, which was once ſuppoſed to exiſt,
ſhe thought rather in ſorrow, than in
anger.</p>
            <p>The morning came, joyleſs and unintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her—ſhe expected nothing but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of common, irkſome occurrences,
with the ſuſpenſe and miſery of not hearing
from Willoughby.—Lady Horatia's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance—Montague
Thorold's ſilent,
but aſſiduous attendance—company whom
ſhe wiſhed not to ſee—or parties abroad
that could afford her no pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The day, and another and another, wore
away, and ſtill no letter from Willoughby
arrived—the forlorn hope, which ſhe had
till now fondly, cheriſhed, that he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0206900203:311"/>
a lingering preference for her in his
heart, now faded away; and an almoſt certain
conviction ſucceeded, that he not only
quitted her for ever, but diſclaimed her
even as a friend; and gave her up in ſilent
contempt, without either offering her the
protection of a relation, or feeling for her
the regret which the loſs of a pleaſant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
would once, ſhe thought, have
given him.</p>
            <p>She repented ſhe had concealed the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe had written from Lady Horatia
Howard; and while ſhe was conſcious that
ſhe ought to have no reſerves towards her,
ſhe felt, that in her preſent anxious ſtate of
ſuſpenſe, it would be ſome conſolation to
talk it over with her friend. But far from
ſoothing her with hope, and attempting to
account for the ſilent neglect of Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
by any means that might palliate its
cruelty, Lady Horatia exhorted her, more
earneſtly than ever, to call off her thoughts
from a man, who was conſidered in every
light ſo unworthy to poſſeſs them: and,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0206900203:312"/>
ſhe urged, more earneſtly than ſhe had
ever yet done, her wiſhes, that the tender
and generous attachment of Montague
Thorold might be immediately rewarded.</p>
            <p>Though to the neceſſity of giving her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to another, Celeſtina could by no means
agree, yet ſhe felt, that ſhe muſt either
learn to think with more calmneſs of her
eternal ſeparation from Willoughby, or ſink
under it—for ſuch pain as the undecided
wretchedneſs of the laſt two or three days
had given her, human nature could not
long ſuſtain. She promiſed Lady Horatia
that ſhe would endeavour to regain her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity;
but beſought her, for a day or
two, to excuſe her from mixing with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and that in the mean time nothing
might be ſaid to Montague Thorold, to give
him more encouragement than he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
received. From the looks of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
when he had ſeen her with him;
and from his preſent diſdainful ſilence, ſhe
ſuppoſed that he believed her engaged to
him, and either reſented her having enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0206900203:313"/>
into ſuch an engagement, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
him, or ſtill felt ſome pain in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
ſhe had given herſelf to another—of
which, ſhe could not help owning, there
was every appearance, from their being ſo
frequently together; and from the report
which had gone forth, which her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
had not only left uncontradicted, but
had rather encouraged. Of Montague
Thorold, therefore, ſhe now thought with
concern and diſquiet, as being partly the
cauſe of the uneaſineſs ſhe ſuffered from
the certainty which every hour in its flight
confirmed, that Willoughby had taken
leave of her for ever.</p>
