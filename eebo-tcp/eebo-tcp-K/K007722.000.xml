            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Take the Liberty of addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the following Sheets to you, without the Formality of asking your Leave: I have for a long Time thought that ſuch a Formality propoſes an implicite Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which is very liable to be turn'd into Ridicule. This was the Opinion
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:4"/>
of the late Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> who had receiv'd more Addreſſes of this Nature, than any Man of his Time. The End of this Epiſtle, is, to return you my humble Thanks for Obligations paſt; for Obligations laid not only upon me, but upon my Country, when you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to ſerve it ſo warmly, by oppoſing that deſperate Scheme which had like to have proved ſo fatal to it, and by adviſing, after the Miſchief was done, the Uſe of Lenitives, rather than of Corroſives, which might have thrown all Things into Confuſion. Another Intention of this Addreſs, is, to implore your Protection for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Arts; for thoſe noble Arts in which you have been educated, and which have rais'd you to this envied Heighth, as it were, on purpoſe that you may prove their Protector and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. You are not to be told, Sir, and it would be eaſy to prove it to the reſt of the World, that the Studies of Humanity in <hi>Great Britain</hi> have flouriſh'd with the Stage; and that with
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:5"/>
the Stage they muſt in time decline. I ſpeak not only of every other Branch of Poetry, but even of that manly Eloquence which appears ſo conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in you, whenever you are pleas'd to diſplay its Charms to an Auguſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. But the Stage is juſt upon the Point of ſinking, unleſs an Arm ſo powerful as yours ſhall vouchſafe to ſupport it. A <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> a <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> and a <hi>Jack Cade</hi> of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> have by Encroachments got the entire Direction of it from its eaſy Patentee, and ſeem reſolv'd, like their Name-ſakes of old, to advance the Rabble and Scum of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> and to oppreſs or demoliſh all whom God and Nature have plac'd above them. The Dramatick Piece on which I have writ the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, has, with a thouſand Faults, and a thouſand Weakneſſes, been palm'd upon the World by ſhameful Artifices for a Wonder of Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And that no one may preſume to detect the Fraud, the Author has inſolently dar'd to fly for Protection
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:6"/>
to the King himſelf. But the Author ought to have known, that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the Deſign of ſo good and ſo wiſe a King, to ſhelter Error from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of Reaſon: He ought to have known, that the King has declar'd his Intention to encourage real Merit, that Learning and Arts may flouriſh; by which Glory may accrue to His Reign, and Honour to <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know very well, Sir, that there has not been in <hi>Europe</hi> theſe thouſand Years a Prince more haughty than <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. a Prince more jealous of his Authority, and more ambitious of Glory: You know, Sir, that almoſt all his Poetical Subjects, who knew the darling Paſſion of his Soul, addreſs'd ſome of their Works to him. You know very well, Sir, that moſt of them had been rewarded by him: And yet when <hi>BOILEAU,</hi> in a Diſcourſe addreſs'd to that King himſelf, and afterwards prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Works, expos'd and ridiculed the greateſt Part of thoſe Pieces; you know very well, Sir, that that diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:7"/>
Prince, who ſaw that his true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and his ſolid Glory depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Advancement of Arts, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the encouraging real Merit, was ſo far from being offended with <hi>BOILEAU</hi> for the Liberty he took in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that it recommended him to his Favour.</p>
            <p>I do believe, from my very Soul, that 'tis the Intention of ſo wiſe a Prince as the King, to encourage Arts and Learning; and I ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it, tho' the King had never told us ſo, becauſe I know it to be his true Intereſt. And therefore I can never believe that 'tis the King's Intention any more to patronize Ignorance and Error in the Writings of his Subjects, than to protect their Vices and Follies of any other Kind. For Ignorance and Error, and Vice and Folly, muſt eſtrange the Hearts of his Subjects from him; only Ignorance and Error, and Vice and Folly, can favour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge that Superſtition, and that falſe Religion, which are his mortal Enemies.
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:8"/>
And yet it has happen'd, by I know not what ſort of Caprice of Fortune, or of Fate, that Arts and Learning have, of late, ſenſibly, if not precipitately, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd. Never did ſuch a Crowd of ill Plays and miſerable Poems appear in ſo ſhort a Time: We have hardly ſeen one good one. And what is yet more ſurpriſing, the moſt ſtupid of all thoſe Plays and Poems, have been addreſs'd to the King himſelf. One would ſwear, that the Authors were wild enough to expect, that Penſions, Gratuities, and Salaries, ſhould be appointed to encourage Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and to mortify Senſe and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The very Boaſt and Glory of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Muſe is Comedy, in which <hi>Great Britain</hi> excels every other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Nay, we can ſhew more good, and more entertaining Comedies, than all the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> together. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Reigns of King <hi>Charles,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>William,</hi> there hardly paſs'd a Year without one or two, and ſometimes three. During the Reign of King <hi>William</hi> alone, we
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:9"/>
had ſeven or eight very agreeable ones, only from two Gentlemen, Sir <hi>John Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Congreve.</hi> But ſince that pernicious Licence was granted to four ſordid Players, during the late Queen's Time, we have hardly had one that has been worth one Farthing.</p>
            <p>Sir, As the King, upon his Acceſſion to the Crown, came a Stranger among us, and as the Miniſtry had then, and have had almoſt ever ſince, Affairs of greater and more immediate Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than thoſe of the Theatre, the aforeſaid Grant of the late Queen was unhappily renew'd; ſince which the Stage has yearly declin'd, and does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline daily; and every Branch of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning daily declines with it. <hi>Etenim omnes artes, quae ad Humanitatem pertinent, habeant quoddam commune vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, &amp; quaſi cognatione quadam inter ſe continentur.</hi> Thus all the Branches of Human Learning are like to be loſt, or very much impair'd, unleſs you ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly undertake to ſupport them. If the Condition in which they are,
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:10"/>
were but known to the King, I am confident, he would not ſuffer them to be driven from among us during his Reign, as he regards either his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Glory, or the Intereſt and Glory of the Nation which he governs. Nor is it beneath the greateſt and the wiſeſt Miniſter to take care of Arts and Letters. Two of the greateſt that ever were in the World, <hi>Maecenas</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> are chiefly famous for the Protection they gave to them. Whenever, in any Nation, Human Learning has been diligently and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially cultivated, at that Time that Nation has flouriſh'd, its King has been glorious and belov'd, and his Miniſters renowned and happy.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN ſometime before the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Play, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſcandalous Artifices that were practis'd to procure Succeſs to it, and was acquainted with the double Cheat which was to be impos'd on the Town, upon their Pockets, and upon their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, I thought I ſhould deſerve the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Publick, if I diſcover'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſo groſs an Impoſition, and ſo palpable an Affront. But inſtead of meeting with the
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:12"/>
Thanks which I expected, and which I thought I had merited by the Service I intended them. I found myſelf in the ſame Situation that <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> was, upon diſcovering the Cheat in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt</hi>; for not only <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Subtle,</hi> who were Joynt-partners in carrying on this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Cheat made vehement Outcries, and ſpread various Slanders, and engag'd ſeveral of their Bubbles to believe them, and diſperſe them, but they obliged the moſt Senſeleſs of all their Bubbles to repeat the Scurrility which they dictated to them. This immediately not only recall'd <hi>Butler</hi>'s Verſes to my Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Doubtleſs the Pleaſure is as great,</l>
               <l>Of being cheated, as to cheat:</l>
               <l>As Lookers-on feel moſt Delight,</l>
               <l>That leaſt perceive a Juggler's Slight,</l>
               <l>And ſtill the leſs they underſtand,</l>
               <l>The more th' admire his Slight of Hand;</l>
            </q>
            <p>but made me ſuſpect that <hi>Butler</hi> in this hardly came up to the full Truth, becauſe the fooliſh Part of the World loves more to be cheated, than the knaviſh Part does to cheat.
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:13"/>
The Generality of Mankind are ſure to love him, who impoſes on them, and to hate him who opens their Eyes; For he who cheats them, does it by entertaining ſome pleaſing Paſſion: But he who undeceives them, holds the Glaſs to them, and ſhews them Truth and themſelves, a mortifying Sight. Now, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you put a Man out of Conceit with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you put him out of Humour with you likewiſe. All the Time the grand Cheat of the South Sea was carrying on by the firſt Directors, I conſtantly obſerv'd, that if any one at any Time was ſo hardy as to tell any one of the Subcribers that he was cheated, it made him terribly out of humour with him who told him ſo, and augmented his implicit Faith in the Directors who cheated him, and redoubled his Reſpect and Eſteem for them.</p>
            <p>The double Cheat above-mention'd, which was contriv'd by <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Subtle</hi> in Concert, but executed cheifly by <hi>Subtle,</hi> was perhaps the moſt audacious that ever was impos'd on the Capital of a great People, by Perſons who pretended at the ſame Time to act by publick Authority: And I know not which is the
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:14"/>
more impudent Part of it; the uſing ſuch ſcandalous Methods, to make the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and moſt inſipid Entertainment that ever came upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage, paſs for the very beſt, or the raiſing the Prices for a Hum-drum Repreſentation, which they had nicknamed a Comedy, and the raiſing them on the Account of the Scenes, forſooth. Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Davenant</hi> was the firſt who brought Scenes upon the Stage, towards the Middle of the laſt Century; and to defray the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of them, from time to time, rais'd the Theatrical Receipt above a third Part high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than it was before. The Pit, which was before but eighteen Pence, was rais'd to Half a Crown; The Boxes, which were Half a Crown before, were advanc'd to four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; the firſt Gallery from a Shilling to eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pence; and the upper Gallery, from Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to a Shilling. So that, as I ſaid before, there is above a third Part of each Night's Receipt, even at the common Prices, allow'd for the Scenes. Now what ſhall we ſay of theſe moſt ſordid Wretches, whoſe Avarice is no more to be ſatisfied than the barren Womb, or the Grave? They are not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:15"/>
it ſeems, with getting, even at common Prices, each of them a thouſand or fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year, which enables them to live in ſhameful Luxury, diſgraceful to <hi>Great Britain</hi>: They are not contented to loll each of them in his gilded Chariot, as often as they vouchſafe, at their own Expence, to give the Publick a <hi>Farce</hi> without Doors, and to look down upon the tranſitory Bubles, who ſupport them: They are not contented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their unmerited Gains, without paying any Thing out of them either to Poor or Publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and that at a Time when Offices, Salaries, Penſions, when every Mortal, every Thing is tax'd: They are not content to be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably indulg'd; but at the ſame Time they muſt impoſe upon the Publick, and wrong their Audiences of twelve hundred Pounds, as they certainly did, during, what, in their Theatrical Cant, they call the Run of their laſt <hi>Rhapſody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some People take Succeſs to be a Proof of Merit in Writers, whereas in the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Taſte, if 'tis attended with a Cabal, 'tis a certain Proof of the want of it. All the <hi>Roman</hi> Satiriſts were out of Humour with
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:16"/>
the ſucceſsful Scriblers of their Times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it appears by what they ſay of them, they ow'd their Succeſs to Cabals, and to the repeating their Works to Aſſemblies: Witneſs what <hi>Horace</hi> ſays of <hi>Fannius</hi> in the <hi>4</hi>th Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of the firſt Book.</p>

            <p>But beſides undeſerved Succeſs, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Satiriſts had another Provocation to Satire, and that was Hypocriſy, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were void of all Morality pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a more rigid Virtue than all the reſt of

the World; and it was this chiefly that mov'd the Spleen of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi> tells us in the firſt Satire of his ſecond Book.</p>

As I make no doubt but that upon the publiſhing this little Treatiſe there will be the ſame Outcries againſt Criticks and Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, which have been formerly ſo often rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I ſhall lay before the Reader what the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> writ in Defence of them, with a great deal of good Senſe, and Addreſs, and Penetration.

The Criticks, it ſeems, are formidable to 'em: TheCriticks are the dreadful Spectres, the Giants, the Enchanters, who traverſe and diſturb them in their Works: Theſe are the Perſecutors, for whoſe Sakes they are ready to hide their Heads, begging Reſcue and Protection from all good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and flying in particular to the Great, by whoſe Favour they hope to be defended

from this mercileſs, examining Race; for what can be more cruel than to be forc'd to ſubmit to the rigorous Laws of Wit, and write under ſuch ſevere Judges as are deaf to all Courtſhip, and can be wrought upon by no Inſinuation or Flattery to paſs by Faults, and pardon any Tranſgreſſion of Art?</p>
               <p>To judge, indeed, of the Circumſtances of a modern Author by the Pattern of his Prefaces, Dedications, and Introductions, one would think, that at the Moment, when a Piece of his was in hand, ſome Conjuration was forming againſt him, ſome diabolical Powers drawing together to blaſt his Work, and croſs his generous Deſign; he therefore rouzes his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hardens his Forehead, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny furious Defiances and <hi>Avaunt-Satans!</hi> enters on his Buſineſs, not with the leaſt regard to what may juſtly be objected to him in a way of Criticiſm, but with an abſolute Contempt of the Manner and Art itſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; arceo,</hi> was in its time, no doubt, a generous Defiance;
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:20"/>
the <hi>Avaunt</hi> was natural and proper in its place, eſpecially where Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were the Poets Theme; but with our Moderns the Caſe is generally the very reverſe, and accordingly the Defiance or <hi>Avaunt</hi> ſhould run much after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As for you vulgar Souls, mere Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals, who know no Art, were never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Temple of Wiſdom, nor ever viſited the Sanctuaries of Wit or Learning, gather yourſelves together from all Parts, and hearken to the Song or Tale I am about to utter; but for you Men of Science and Underſtanding, who have Ears and Judgment, and can weigh Senſe, ſcan Syllables, and meaſure Sounds; you who by a certain Art diſtinguiſh falſe Thought from true, Correctneſs from Rudeneſs, and Bombaſt and Chaos from Order and the Sublime, away hence! or ſtand aloof! whilſt I practiſe upon the Eaſineſs of thoſe mean Capacities and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions who make the moſt numerous Audience, and are the only competent Judges of my Labours.</p>

Accuracy of Workmanſhip requires a Critick's Eye; 'tis loſt upon a vulgar Judgment. Nothing grieves a real Artiſt, more than that Indifference of the Publick, which ſuffers Work to paſs uncriticiz'd. Nothing on the other Side, rejoices him, more than the nice View and Inſpection of the accurate Examiner, and Judge of Work: 'Tis the mean Genius, the ſlovenly Performer, who knowing nothing of true Workmanſhip, endeavours by the beſt outward Gloſs, and dazzling Shew, to turn the Eye from a direct and ſteddy Survey of his Piece.</p>
               <p>What is there which an expert Muſician more deſires than to perform his Part in in the Preſence of thoſe who are knowing in his Art? 'Tis to the Ear alone he applies himſelf; the critical, the nice Ear. Let his Hearers be of what Character they pleaſe: Be they naturally auſtere, moroſe, or rigid; no matter ſo they are Criticks, able to cenſure, remark, and ſound every Accord and Symphony. What is there mortifies the good Painter, more than when amidſt his admiring Spectators, there is not one preſent who has been us'd to compare the
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:22"/>
Hands of different Maſters, or has an Eye to diſtinguiſh the Advantages or Defects of every Stile? Thro' all the inferior Orders of Mechanicks, the Rule is found to hold the ſame: In every Science, every Art, the real Maſters, or Proficients, rejoice in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than in the thorough Search and Examination of their Performances by all the Rules of Art, and niceſt Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm. Why therefore (in the Muſes Name) is it not the ſame with our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the Writing Art; our Poets and Proſe Authors of every kind? Why, in this Profeſſion are we found ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick-Haters, and indulg'd in this unlearn'd Averſion, unleſs it be taken for granted that as Wit and Learning ſtand at preſent, in our Nation, we are ſtill upon the Foot of Empiricks and Mountebanks.</p>
               <p>From theſe Conſiderations, I take upon me abſolutely to condemn the faſhionable Cuſtom of inveighing againſt <hi>Criticks,</hi> as the common Enemies, the Peſts, and Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries of the Commonwealth of Wit and Letters. I aſſert, on the contrary, that they are the Props and Pillars of this Building;

            <p>Thus far the late moſt ingenious and moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> has gone in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Criticks and Criticiſm. I ſhall deſire to ſay a little in my own particular Defence: I have been long ſince repreſented, by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have never read what I have writ, as one who likes nothing, and one who makes it his Buſineſs to find out Faults, and never diſcovers Beauties: Upon my publiſhing lately the Defence of Sir <hi>Fopling Flutter,</hi> this Accuſation was renew'd, tho' it was a Contradiction in Terms. It being impoſſible that any one can write a Defence of a <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Poem, which he does not like; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Comedy, in which he finds no Beauties. The Truth of this Affair is, that no <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Author of any Note has commended ſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets, as I have: I ſhall give a Liſt of ſome of them; <hi>Shakeſpear, Ben Johnſon, Milton, Butler, Roſcomon, Denham, Waller, Dryden, Wycherly, Otway, Etherege, Shadwell, Crown, Congreve, Phillips.</hi> Theſe are ſome of thoſe whom I have occaſionally
<pb facs="tcp:0127703400:24"/>
commended, and in ſome of them too have found out Beauties, which every one could not diſcover.</p>
            <p>If any one believes, that in ſome Places of the following Sheets I have been too harſh, and too ſevere, I deſire ſuch a one to conſider, that I have been baſely wrong'd, and barbarouſly us'd, by the Perſons upon whom I may be thought to be too ſevere: And as the Wrongs which have been done me, do not come within the Cognizance of the National Law, nor under the uſual Forms of the National Equity, I am as to this Matter, in a State of Nature with thoſe Perſons, and am authoriz'd by the Law of Nature to do myſelf Juſtice, as far as it may be done, without offending the Laws of my Country, or impartial Equity.</p>

Humility in a Dramatick Writer, to affirm, that he is indebted for his whole Succeſs to the Actors? I was apt to believe, at the firſt Sight, that this was an affected Modeſty, and a counterfeit Humility. But when I went a little further, I began to think I was miſtaken, and that the Author was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; for he ſeems to be apprehenſive, that the Applauſe of the Reader would hardly be ſo general as was that of the Spectator; and he does his Endeavour to induce the Reader not to paſs a Judgment of the Play, till he has ſeen it acted: <hi>It muſt be remembred,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that a Play is to be ſeen, and is made to be repreſented with the Advantage of Actors, nor can appear but with half the Spirit without it.</hi> Now there have been ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plays writ in ſeveral Languages, which were never deſign'd to be ſeen. There are two of our own: The Tragedy of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> by <hi>Milton</hi>; and the <hi>State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> by <hi>Dryden.</hi> 'Tis true, indeed, moſt Plays are deſign'd by their Authors to be ſeen, but that is not the chief Deſign of a Dramatick Writer, who has a good Genius. For ſuch an Author writes to all Countries, and to all Ages, and writes with the lively Hope, that his great Maſter-pieces ſhall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the very Language in which they are compos'd. When Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſays, That a Play can appear but with half the Spirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſee it acted, I would fain ask, on whom he deſigns to impoſe this? If he who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0127703400:27"/>
reads a Play is qualified to read and to judge, he reads it with a truer and juſter Spirit than can be ſupplied by any Company of Actors. If ſuch a Reader happens at any Time to be better pleaſed with the Repreſentation of a Play than the reading it, 'tis an infallible Sign, that ſuch a Play is a very wretched Performance.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee how Sir <hi>Richard</hi> goes on. <hi>The greateſt Effect,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of a Play in reading it, is to excite the Reader to go ſee it; and when he does ſo, it is then a Play has the Effect of Precept and Example.</hi> Good God! is it poſſible that this could come from any one but a Man who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſhew that he takes all his Readers to be Ideots? When we read the Tragedies of <hi>Sophocles</hi> or <hi>Euripides,</hi> or the Comedies of <hi>Ariſtophanes, Plautus,</hi> or <hi>Terence,</hi> is the greateſt Effect they have upon us, the exciting us to go to ſee them acted? When Sir <hi>Richard</hi> read the <hi>Andria</hi> of <hi>Terence,</hi> was the exciting him to go to ſee it acted the greateſt Effect that it had upon him? No, the greateſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that it had upon him, was the Deſire to ſee another Play acted, and that was his own deplorable Imitation of the <hi>Andria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But a Play,</hi> ſays he, <hi>has only, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, the Effect of Example and Precept.</hi> So that 'tis not the Dramatick Perſons, it ſeems, 'tis not <hi>Timoleon, Scipio, Bontus,</hi> who are to be the Examples of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0127703400:28"/>
to us; no, 'tis the Players, I warrant, who repreſent them; 'tis Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Wilks,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colley Cibber,</hi> whoſe Heroick Virtue we are to imitate, and by whoſe Actions we are to be inſtructed.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Richard</hi> goes on, and tells us, That the chief Deſign of the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> was to be an innocent Performance. Now there are a hundred innocent Performances upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Stage: But perhaps he meant a Performance that ſhould have nothing but its Innocence to recommend it, and ſhould, by conſequence, be thought the only Play of its Kind. But in that he is miſtaken, for there is one more, and that is, the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>Bays</hi> in the <hi>Rehearſal,</hi> which is, indeed, incoherent, incongruous, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, inſipid, and ridiculous; but certainly a very innocent Performance. I am afraid it will appear by the following Sheets, that the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> has no ſmall Share of ſome of theſe Qualities, and has nothing valuable but barely the Cataſtrophe. And here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but obſerve, that Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> who has upon ſo many Occaſions inveigh'd againſt the Rules, and particularly, in that notable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per call'd the <hi>Theatre,</hi> owes the only enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Scene of his Play to the Obſervation of a Rule of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which is, That the Diſcovery ſhould be immediately follow'd by the Change of Fortune, that is, by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe. Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> indeed, without ever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0127703400:29"/>
dreaming of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> had it from <hi>Terence,</hi> who took it from <hi>Menander,</hi> who had it from the Precept of that great Philoſopher, and from the Practice of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides.</hi> For the tragick and comick Poets frequently borrow'd their Hints from one another; but, at the ſame time, took Care to do it with Judgment, and not to intrench upon each other's Province. And therefore we ſee, that the Diſcovery in <hi>Terence,</hi> and the Reconciliation of <hi>Simo</hi> to <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> is comprehended in a narrow Compaſs, and has nothing in it of thoſe violent Tranſports of Grief which are inconſiſtent with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>

               <l>Verſibus exponi Tragicis res comica non vult,</l>

               <l>Le Comique ennemi des ſoupirs &amp; des pleurs</l>

            </q>
            <p>But I beg the Reader's Pardon for this Digreſſion, and now return to the Preface.</p>
            <p>As to the Quarrel in the fourth Act, I ſhall ſpeak to it in its Place. In the mean time I am of the Number of thoſe, who believe that this Incident, and the Caſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Daughter, are not the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0127703400:30"/>
of Comedy. When Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſays, that any thing that has its Foundation in Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Succeſs muſt be the Subject of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he confounds Comedy with that Species of Tragedy which has a happy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe. When he ſays, that 'tis an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Comedy to introduce a Joy too exquiſite for Laughter, he takes all the Care that he can to ſhew, that he knows nothing of the Nature of Comedy. Does he really believe that <hi>Moliere</hi> underſtood the Nature of it: I ſay <hi>Moliere,</hi> who, in the Opinion of all <hi>Europe,</hi> excepting that ſmall Portion of it which is acquainted with <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi> had born away the Prize of Comedy from all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from all Ages, if for the ſake of his Profit, he had not deſcended ſometimes too much to Buffoonry. Let Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> or any one, look into that little Piece of <hi>Moliere,</hi> call'd, <hi>La Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes,</hi> and he ſhall find there, that in <hi>Moliere</hi>'s Opinion, 'tis the Buſineſs of a Comick Poet to enter into the Ridicule of Men, and to expoſe the blind Sides of all Sorts of People agreeably; that he does nothing at all, if he does not draw the Pictures of his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, and does not raiſe the Mirth of the ſenſible Part of an Audience, which, ſays he, 'tis no eaſy Matter to do. This is the Senſe of <hi>Moliere,</hi> tho' the Words are not his exactly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0127703400:31"/>
When Sir <hi>Richard</hi> talks of a Joy too exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for Laughter, he ſeems not to know that Joy, generally taken, is common like Anger, Indignation, Love, to all Sorts of Poetry, to the Epick, the Dramatick, the Lyrick; but that that kind of Joy which is attended with Laughter, is the Characteriſtick of Comedy; as Terror or Compaſſion, according as one or the other is predominant, makes the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick of Tragedy, as Admiration does of Epick Poetry.</p>
            <p>When Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſays, That weeping upon the Sight of a deplorable Object is not a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for Laughter, but that 'tis agreeable to good Senſe and to Humanity, he ſays nothing but what all the ſenſible Part of the World has already granted; but then all that ſenſible Part of the World have always deny'd, that a deplorable Object is fit to be ſhewn in Comedy. When Sir <hi>George Etherege,</hi> in his Comedy of <hi>Sir Fopling Flutter,</hi> ſhews <hi>Loveit</hi> in all the Height and Violence of Grief and Rage, the Judicious Poet takes care to give thoſe Paſſions a ridiculous Turn by the Mouth of <hi>Dorimant.</hi> Beſides that, the Subject is at the Bottom ridiculous: For <hi>Loveit</hi> is a Miſtreſs, who has abandon'd her ſelf to <hi>Dorimant</hi>; and by falling into theſe violent Paſſions, only becauſe ſhe fancies that ſomething of which ſhe is very deſirous has gone beſide her, makes herſelf truly ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Thus is this famous Scene in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0127703400:32"/>
Act of <hi>Sir Foppling,</hi> by the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Loveit,</hi> and the dextrous handling the Subject, kept within the Bounds of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: But the Scene of the Diſcovery in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> is truly Tragical. <hi>Indiana</hi> was ſtrictly virtuous: She had indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a violent Paſſion for <hi>Bevil</hi>; but all young People in full Health are liable to ſuch a Paſſion, and perhaps the moſt ſenſible and the moſt virtuous are more than others lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But beſides, that ſhe had kept this Paſſion within the Bounds of Honour, it was the natural Effect of her Eſteem for her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, and of her Gratitude, that is, of her Virtue. Theſe Conſiderations render'd her Caſe deplorable, and the Cataſtrophe down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right tragical, which of a Comedy ought to be the moſt comical Part, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it ought to be the moſt tragical Part of a Tragedy.</p>
            <p>Before I take my Leave of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Preface, I cannot help ſaying a Word to his Song, which he has brought in here by Violence, to the great Surprize of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for no other End, than to ſhew that he is as notable at Metre as he is at Proſe. He ſeems as much concern'd for the Omiſſion of it in the Repreſentation of his, as <hi>Bays</hi> in the third Act of the <hi>Rehearſal</hi> is for the Neglect of his; nay, and to have as high an Opinion of it, as that merry Bard diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers that he has of his, when he ſays to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0127703400:33"/>
               <hi>Johnſon, What! are they gone without ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my laſt new Song? 's Bud, would it were in their Bellies. I'll tell you, Mr.</hi> Johnſon<hi>, if I have any Skill in theſe Matters, I vow to Gad this Song is peremptorily the very beſt that ever yet was written: You muſt know it was made by</hi> Tom Thimble<hi>'s firſt Wife, after ſhe was dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this Song of Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> too, as well as his Brother Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s, is a Love-Song, deſign'd juſt as judiciouſly, expreſs'd juſt as paſſionately, but more harmoniouſly, more freely, and better contriv'd for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody. And yet from the Omiſſion of this Song of his, does Sir <hi>Richard</hi> take an occaſion to affront the fineſt Artiſt of his kind in the World, and to treat Signor <hi>Carbonelli</hi> like a Country Fidler, who ſings <hi>John Dory</hi> at Wakes and Fairs to Hobnail'd Peaſants and Milk-Maids.</p>
            <p>I thought here to take my Leave; but the Sight of <hi>Terence</hi> and <hi>Cibber</hi> together pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes me to go a little farther.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſays, that he is extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to find what <hi>Cibber</hi> told him prove a Truth, that what he valued himſelf ſo much upon, the Tranſlation of <hi>Terence</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0127703400:34"/>
imputed to him as a Reproach. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> knew very well, that <hi>Cibber</hi> had ſaid ſo many falſe Things with relation to this Play, that he might be very well ſurpriz'd to find Truth come from him, eſpecially upon that Subject. But Sir <hi>Richard</hi> is miſtaken; <hi>Cibber</hi> is conſtant to himſelf, and does not deviate from Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood upon this Occaſion. No Mortal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches Sir <hi>Richard</hi> with his Tranſlation of <hi>Terence.</hi> He has ſhewn clearly, that he is not capable of tranſlating any one Scene of him. But tho' he had been never ſo capable, he ought to have known that a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Terence,</hi> by the beſt Hand in the World, would not ſucceed upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stage. He ought to have known the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, who liv'd ſome time after him, and eſpecially <hi>Caeſar,</hi> found in that Comick Poet. The great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him was, that he wanted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Force, that is to ſay, that he had not in his Comedies that Humour and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry which are ſo agreeable to the Nature of Comedy. For the Force of any kind of Writing conſiſts chiefly in that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes it from all other Kinds. Now the Ridicule being that which diſtinguiſhes Comedy from every other kind of Poetry, the <hi>Comick Force</hi> muſt conſiſt in that. But how came it to paſs then, that five of the ſix Comedies of <hi>Terence</hi> ſucceeded upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Stage? The Anſwer is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0127703400:35"/>
the Generality of the <hi>Romans,</hi> at the Time they were writ, knew no better. The <hi>Roman</hi> Comedy in general had but little of that agreeable Pleaſantry that is fit to divert Men of Senſe, which occaſion'd the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cenſure of <hi>Quintilian</hi>: <hi>In Comaedia maxime claudicamus: licet</hi> Varro <hi>dicat Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas,</hi> Aelii Stolonis <hi>ſententia,</hi> Plautino <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone locuturas fuiſſe, ſi latinè loqui vellent: licet Caecilium veteres laudibus ferant: licet</hi> Terentii <hi>ſcripta ad</hi> Scipionem Africanum <hi>referantur: quae tamen ſunt in hoc genere elegantiſſima, &amp; plus adhuc habitura gratiae ſi intra Verſus trimetros ſtetiſſent. Vix le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem conſequimur umbram, adeo ut mihi ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo ipſe</hi> Romanus <hi>non recipere videatur illam ſolis conceſſam Atticis venerem, quando eam ne</hi> Graeci <hi>quidem in alio genere linguae obtinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erint.</hi> And therefore, when <hi>Shadwell</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to write a Comedy upon the Plan of the <hi>Adelphi,</hi> he, who very well knew the Nature of his Art, and by conſequence knew what was defective in the <hi>Roman</hi> Comedy, took particular Care to ſupply from his own Invention the Ridicule that was wanting in that; and it was by uſing that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that he made the <hi>Squire of Alſatia</hi> a very good and very entertaining Comedy. <hi>Moliere,</hi> who writ upon the ſame Plan, has done the very ſame Thing in his <hi>L'Ecole des Maris.</hi> He has done the very ſame in his <hi>Fourberies de Scapin,</hi> which is writ upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0127703400:36"/>
the Plan of the <hi>Phormio</hi>; but in the latter, he has gone too far, and ſhamefully, to uſe the Expreſſion of <hi>Boileau,</hi> coupled <hi>Terence</hi> with <hi>Jack-Pudding</hi>; a Conjunction as ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous as Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had made of <hi>Terence</hi> and his Friend <hi>Cibber:</hi> I heartily congratulate both of them upon this their mutual Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. They are <hi>par nobile fratrum,</hi> a Pair ſo pious, ſo good, ſo human, ſo virtuous, ſo religious, that they are perfectly ſecur'd, even in the midſt of a treacherous World, of each other's mutual Fidelity; becauſe there is not in the World that Third Perſon who is fit to be a Friend to either. The Knight was too humble, when he attributed the great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Play to the Players in general; the Succeſs is only due to himſelf, and to his virtuous Friend; that is, to that Cabal which was ſo induſtriouſly conven'd by them, and to thoſe Artifices which were with ſo much Skill conducted by them. They have done greater Services than this for each other, and have ſecured the Stage to themſelves alone, which they regard as their proper <hi>Domain,</hi> and therefore every Stranger who for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes upon their Ground, is to be eſteem'd a Treſpaſſer. In the mean Time, they have reſolved between themſelves, to make the Town ſwallow any Entertainment which they ſhall think fit to provide for them; and they ſeem agreed to vouch for each other. <hi>Cibber</hi> is to make Affidavit, that the Knight's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0127703400:37"/>
Gudgeons are Cod-Fiſh and Sea-Carp, that arriv'd by the laſt Fiſh-Pool; and the Knight is to give it upon his immaculate Honour, that <hi>Cibber</hi>'s Strickle-Bats and Millers-Thumbs are either Mullets or Turbuts. And they ſeem to have made a formal Order, That the Town ſhall believe them, under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of being treated with the ſame Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's that <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were treated by <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Tale of a Tub</hi>; that is, if you will not give Credit to what we tell you, rather than believe your Senſes, G<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <head>REMARKS ON THE <hi>Conſcious Lovers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE determin'd to make ſome Remarks, with Brevity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiallity, upon a late Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Performance, call'd, <hi>The Conſcious Lovers,</hi> a Comedy: That I may be then certainly able to determine whether the great Succeſs of it is owing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Merit, or to thoſe extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Methods which I have lately taken Notice of in a former Treatiſe, and which, if there is not a ſudden Stop put to them, will occaſion the utter Downfal of the Stage, and of all the Arts dependent on it.</p>
            <p>'Tis an Obſervation of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the ſixteenth Chapter of his <hi>Poeticks,</hi> that there ſhould be no Incident in the Action of a Tragedy, which ſhould be without its Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe the Abſurdity of the Incidents
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0127703400:39"/>
would deſtroy the Probability of the Action, and turn poetical Fiction into downright Falſhood. Now, if upon this Account 'tis requir'd that all the Incidents ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in Tragedy, 'tis ſtill more requiſite in Comedy, where the Probable is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the Wonderful leſs tolerable. But now this whole Dramatick Performance ſeems to me to be built upon ſeveral Things which have no Foundation, either in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, or in Reaſon, or Nature. The Father of <hi>Indiana,</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>Danvers,</hi> and who was formerly an eminent Merchant at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> upon his Arrival from the <hi>Indies,</hi> from whence he returns with a great Eſtate, carries on a very great Trade at <hi>London</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his Friends and Relations at <hi>Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Sealand.</hi> Now this Fiction, without which there could be no Comedy, nor any thing call'd a Comedy, is not ſupported by Probability, or by Reaſon, or Nature. 'Tis true, he tells his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the fifth Act, towards the Top of the 82d Page, That when his Misfortunes drove him to the <hi>Indies,</hi> for Reaſons too tedious to be mention'd at the Time he ſpoke, he chang'd his Name of <hi>Danvers</hi> into <hi>Sealand.</hi> When his Misfortunes drove him out of his Country, thoſe Misfortunes were Reaſons ſufficient to account for the changing his Name. But is it probable, that at his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or at his Return to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0127703400:40"/>
with a vaſt Eſtate, he ſhould ſtill retain the Name of <hi>Sealand?</hi> Is it natural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that under that borrow'd Name he ſhould conceal himſelf from his Family and all his Relations, as it appears by what his Daughter ſays, <hi>Act</hi> II. <hi>Page</hi> 30. that he does? Is it credible, that he could be ſuch a Monſter, as never to ſend to <hi>Briſtol</hi> after his Arrival from the <hi>Indies,</hi> to enquire after his Wife, his Siſter, and his Daughter? and that he ſhould feloniouſly marry a ſecond Wife, without ever knowing what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the firſt? Is it reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if he could be abſurd enough to deſign this, he could ever poſſibly effect it? Is it poſſible that a Man can return from the <hi>Indies</hi> with a vaſt Eſtate, and the World ſhould not know either what he is, or what he was when he went thither, eſpecially when he traded to every Part of the Globe? Is there ſo much as one Man in <hi>England</hi> with a vaſt Eſtate, whoſe Original is not known? Or was there ever any one great Merchant of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Family and Original was not known to the Merchants at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> when betwixt the one and the other there is always ſo ſtrict and conſtant a Communication?</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, the filial Obedience of young <hi>Bevil</hi> is carried a great deal too far. He is ſaid to be one of a great Eſtate, and a great Underſtanding; and yet he makes a Promiſe to his Father, not to marry without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0127703400:41"/>
which is a Promiſe that can do his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only a vain imaginary Good, and may do him real Hurt. A young Man of a great Underſtanding, cannot but know, that if he makes ſuch a Promiſe, he may be oblig'd to break it, or periſh, or, at leaſt, be unhappy all the reſt of his Life. Such a one cannot but know, that he may poſſibly be ſeiz'd with a Paſſion ſo reſiſtleſs, and ſo violent, that he muſt poſſeſs, or periſh; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if the Woman who inſpires this Paſſion, be a Woman of ſtrict Virtue, he muſt marry, or periſh, or, at leaſt, be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally uneaſy for the reſt of his Life. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, indeed, before they come to Years of Diſcretion are oblig'd to pay a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Parents. But after they are come to the full Uſe of their Reaſon, they are only bound to obey them in what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. Indeed, if a Son is in Expectation of an Eſtate from his Father, he is engag'd to a good deal of Compliance, even after he comes to Years of Diſcretion. But that was not <hi>Bevil</hi>'s Caſe: He enjoy'd a very good one of his Mother's, by vertue of a Marriage Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; and therefore it was unreaſonable in him to make ſuch a Promiſe to his Father, as it was unreaſonable in his Father to urge him to it, eſpecially upon ſo ſordid a Motive as the doubling a great Eſtate. This is acting in a manner ſomething arbitrary. And it ill becomes an Author, who would be thought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0127703400:42"/>
a Patron of Liberty, to ſuppoſe that Fathers are abſolute, when Kings themſelves are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If he had not an Underſtanding of his own to tell him this, he might have learn'd from Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> in his ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his admirable <hi>Eſſay on Government: That every Man has a Right to his natural Freedom, without being ſubjected to the Will or Authority of any other Man. Children, I confeſs,</hi> ſays that great Man, <hi>are not born in this full State of Equality, though they are born to it. Their Parents have a ſort of Rule and Juriſdiction over them when they come into the World, and for ſome Time after; but 'tis,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but a temporary one. The Bonds of this Subjection are like the Swadling Clothes which they are wrapp'd up in, and ſupported by in the Weakneſs of their Infancy: Age and Reaſon, as they grow up, looſen them, till at length they drop quite off, and leave a Man at his own free Diſpoſal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Author a little after adds, <hi>That God having given Man an Underſtanding to direct his Actions, has allowed him a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will, and Liberty of acting, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging thereunto, within the Bounds of that Law he is under. But while he is in an Eſtate wherein he has no Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own to direct his Will, he is not to have any Will of his own to follow; he that underſtands for him, muſt will for him too; he muſt preſcribe to his Will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0127703400:43"/>
               <hi>his Actions: But when he comes to the Eſtate that made his Father a Freeman, the Son is a Freeman too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This holds,</hi> ſays that great Man, <hi>in all the Laws a Man is under, whether Natural or Civil. Is a Man under the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What made him free of that Law? What gave him a free diſpoſing of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty according to his own Will, within the Compaſs of that Law? I anſwer, a State of Maturity, wherein he might be ſuppos'd capable to know that Law, that ſo he might keep his Actions within the Bounds of it. When he has acquir'd that State, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd to know how far that Law is to be his Guide, and how far he may make uſe of his Freedom; and ſo comes to have it: Till then ſome body elſe muſt guide him, who is preſum'd to know how far the Law allows a Liberty. If ſuch a State of Reaſon, ſuch an Age of Diſcretion made him free, the ſame ſhall make his Son free too. Is a Man under the Law of</hi> England<hi>? What made him free of that Law; that is, to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to diſpoſe of his Actions and Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions according to his own Will, within the Permiſſion of that Law? A Capacity of knowing that Law, which is ſuppos'd by that Law at the Age of Twenty one, and in ſome Caſes ſooner. If this made the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free, it ſhall make the Son free too. Till then we ſee the Law allows the Son</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0127703400:44"/>
               <hi>to have no Will, but he is to be guided by the Will of his Father, or Guardian, who is to underſtand for him. And if the Father die, and fail to ſubſtitute a Deputy in this Truſt, if he has not provided a Deputy to govern his Son during his Minority, during his want of Underſtanding, the Law takes care to do it; ſome other muſt govern him, and be a Will to him till he has attain'd to a State of Freedom, and his Underſtanding be fit to take the Government of his Will. But after that the Father and Son are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free, as much as a Tutor and Pupil after Nonage, equally Subjects of the ſame Law together, without any Dominion left in the Father over the Life, Liberty, or Eſtate of the Son, whether they be only in the State, and under the Law of Nature, or under the poſitive Laws of an eſtabliſh'd Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that this Quotation has been a great deal too long; and yet to ſet the Unreaſonableneſs of <hi>Bevil</hi>'s Promiſe in a full Light, I am oblig'd to add what the ſame Author ſays a little lower in the very ſame Chapter, <hi>viz. The Power of the Father extends not to the Laws, or Goods, which either his Children's Induſtry, or another's Bounty has made theirs, nor to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty neither, when they are once arriv'd to the Enfranchiſement of the Years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The Father's Empire then ceaſes; and he can from thence-forwards no more</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0127703400:45"/>
               <hi>diſpoſe of the Liberty of his Son, than of any other Man. And it muſt be far from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or perpetual Juriſdiction, from which a Man may withdraw himſelf; having Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from divine Authority, to leave Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and cleave to his Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what I have quoted from ſo judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſo penetrating an Author, I think it is pretty plain, that young <hi>Bevil,</hi> who diſpos'd of part of his Eſtate without, nay, and as he might reaſonably ſuppoſe, againſt the Conſent of his Father, might <hi>à fortiori</hi> have diſpos'd of his Perſon too, if it had not been for his unreaſonable Promiſe; and that 'tis highly improbable, that one of the Eſtate and Underſtanding, which he is ſaid to have, ſhould abſurdly make a Promiſe which might poſſibly endanger the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his whole Life. 'Tis ſaid, indeed, in more than one Place of the Play, that the Son has uncommon Obligations to his Father; but we are neither told, nor are we able to gueſs what thoſe Obligations are. What uncommon Obligations can a Son, who has a great Eſtate in Poſſeſſion, have to a Father of ſo ſordid a Nature as Sir <hi>John Bevil</hi> ſhews himſelf? <hi>Act</hi> 4. <hi>Page</hi> 65. Beſides, what Obligations can be binding enough to make a Man of a great Eſtate part with Liberty, with the very Liberty of his Choice, in the moſt important Action of his Life, upon which the Happineſs of all the reſt depends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0127703400:46"/>
But as unreaſonable as this Promiſe is, which young <hi>Bevil</hi> made to his Father, by which he gave away his Birthright, his Liberty, yes, the very Liberty of his Choice, in an Affair upon which his Happineſs moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, his Behaviour to <hi>Indiana</hi> is ſtill more unaccountable: He loves her, and is beloved by her; makes conſtant Viſits and profuſe Preſents to her; and yet conceals his Paſſion from her; which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a clumſy Expedient for the Author's preparing the Diſcovery, but is neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Nature nor Reaſon: For 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any young Man in Nature in Health and Vigour, and in the Height of a violent Paſſion, can ſo far command him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the meer Force of Reaſon. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, indeed, to allow that he may be able to do it by the Aſſiſtance of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: But the Buſineſs of a Comick Poet is only to teach Morality: Grace is not taught, but inſpir'd. The dreadful Myſteries of Chriſtianity are but ill compatible with the Lightneſs and Mirth of Comedy; or with the Obſcenity and Prophaneſs of a degenerate Stage, or with the Diſpoſitions of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, compos'd of Perſons who have ſome of them no Religion, and ſome of them not the true one. Beſides that, nothing but a Doctrine taken from the moral Law can be a juſt Foundation of a Fable; which every true Comedy is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0127703400:47"/>
Nor is ſuch a Behaviour any more agreeable to Reaſon, than it is to Nature: <hi>Bevil</hi> loves <hi>Indiana,</hi> and is beloved by her: She adores him, ſhe dies for him, and he knows it: He obſerves it; and obſerves at the ſame Time that ſo violent a Paſſion is attended with equal Anxiety; and that Anxiety is entirely caus'd by the perplexing Doubt ſhe is in, whether ſhe is beloved, or not, as appears by what he ſays himſelf, <hi>Act</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 27. Why then doth he not declare himſelf, and by that Declaration compoſe her Mind, and qualify her to expect with Patience the Benefit of Time. 'Tis indeed true, that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd his Father never to marry without his Conſent, while his Father liv'd; but he had not promis'd him never to love without his Conſent; for that would have been a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Promiſe; a Promiſe, the Performance of Non-performance of which was not in his own Power, and would depend entirely on what the People call <hi>Chance,</hi> and what Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers call <hi>Providence.</hi> What could he mean then by not declaring himſelf? As the Love he had conceiv'd for <hi>Indiana</hi> was no Breach of the Promiſe he had made to his Father, ſo neither could he violate it by any Declaration of that Paſſion! What then, once more, can he mean by his Silence? His only reaſonable way of proceeding had been to acquaint not only his Miſtreſs, but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the World, with the Paſſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0127703400:48"/>
which he felt for her, and with the Neceſſity he was in to marry her, or to be for ever miſerable. Such a Declaration was not at all inconſiſtent with his Duty; and if his Father had either Reaſon or Compaſſion, would have caus'd him to relent, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe his Son from a Promiſe, the perſevering in which muſt prove unhappy, or fatal to him. If it ſhould be ſaid that ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of his Paſſion was neceſſary, that he might make a Retreat with Honour, in Caſe his Father ſhould ſtill be obſtinate; to this I anſwer, That there was no Retreat for him, unleſs he would at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from Virtue and Honour; that his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour had fix'd and determined him; that by his Generoſity and conſtant Viſits, he had raiſed the Paſſion of <hi>Indiana</hi> to ſuch a Height, that his leaving her would in all likelihood be followed by Madneſs, or by Self-murder, or by dreadful Hyſterical Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as deplorable as either; of which, what paſſes between her Father and her in the fifth Act, is a ſufficient Proof. Beſide, that ſuch a Retreat would prove as fatal to her Honour as to her Perſon: He had for ſome time made conſtant Viſits; he had made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extravagant Preſents to her; he had made no Declaration of the Affection he had for her, either to her or to her Aunt <hi>Iſabella,</hi> or acquainted any one with his Deſign to marry her, if he could obtain his Father's
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0127703400:49"/>
Conſent. Now can any thing be more plain, than that ſuch a Behaviour, if he left her, would ruin the Reputation of the poor Lady, and cauſe all the World to entertain ſuch Thoughts of her as <hi>Sealand</hi> and <hi>Myrtle</hi> had already expreſs'd. And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſhew that the Behaviour of <hi>Bevil</hi> to <hi>Indiana,</hi> in his concealing his Paſſion from her, is as ridiculouſly whimſical, as that of <hi>Cimberton</hi> to her Siſter <hi>Lucinda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cataſtophre, I muſt confeſs, is very moving, but it would be more ſo, if it were rightly and reaſonably handled, becauſe it would be much more ſurprizing. For the Surprize is, in a good Meaſure, prevented by the Behaviour of <hi>Iſabella</hi> upon the firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Sealand</hi>; which, if it had not been out of all Probability and Nature, would have prevented it more. It was highly in Nature and Probability, that <hi>Iſabella,</hi> upon the firſt diſcovering her Brother, ſhould fly into an exceſſive Tranſport of Joy, and have run to embrace him; for when ſhe is made to ſay, That her Brother muſt not know her yet, ſhe is made to give no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, nor can the Audience imagine any. 'Tis not <hi>Iſabella</hi> who ſays that, but the Author, who clumſily uſes it to ſerve a Turn; for if ſhe had diſcover'd herſelf to her Brother at his firſt Appearance, it had prevented the Audience's Sorrow and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the imaginary Diſtreſs of <hi>Indiana,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0127703400:50"/>
and, conſequently, their return to Joy. But as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and all the great Criticks after him, have taught us, that there is to be no Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a Dramatick Poem, but what muſt be founded on Reaſon, it happens, as we obſerv'd above, very unluckily here, that there is no Incident in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> but what is attended by ſome great Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. For the Action of <hi>Indiana,</hi> in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away her Bracelet, is of the ſame Stamp, and is entirely the Author's, and not the Dramatick Perſon's; for it was neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary nor profitable, that <hi>Indiana,</hi> in the Height of her Agony, ſhould ſo much as think of her Bracelet, or if ſhe did think of it, ſhould reſolve to throw away the greateſt Token that ſhe had to remember her dead Mother, for whoſe Memory her Grief and Diſtreſs ought naturally to renew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double her Tenderneſs. But the Author is obliged to have Recourſe to this as an awkard Expedient, tho' the beſt he could find, to bring on the Diſcovery. But had he known any thing of the Art of the Stage, he would have known, that thoſe Diſcoveries are but dully made, which are made by Tokens; that they ought neceſſarily or probably to ſpring from the whole Train of the Incidents contrary to our Expectation. And how eaſy was it to bring that about here? For ſuch a Diſcovery had been very well prepared, by what young <hi>Bevil</hi> ſays to <hi>Humphrey</hi> in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0127703400:51"/>
firſt Act, and by the Hint <hi>Indiana</hi> gives to <hi>Sealand</hi> in the fifth Act, which Hint the old Gentleman readily takes; for when ſhe tells him ſhe had been made an Infant Captive on the Seas, he immediately crys out, <hi>An Infant Captive!</hi> and, after ſome Interruption given by <hi>Indiana,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Dear Lady! O yet one Moment's Patience, my Heart grows full with your Affliction, but yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your Story that</hi>—She anſwers as if ſhe were at croſs Purpoſes, <hi>My Portion here is Bitterneſs and Sorrow.</hi> To which he replies, <hi>Do not think ſo. Pray anſwer me, Does</hi> Bevil <hi>know your Name and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> So that a few Queſtions more, perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently anſwer'd, would have brought on the Diſcovery. Now if the Diſcovery had been made this Way, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> had not known her Brother at her firſt ſeeing him, but had come in to <hi>Sealand</hi> and <hi>Indiana</hi> juſt after the Diſcovery had been made, there would have been two Surprizes, both greater and more agreeable than now they are, and both of them without Abſurdity.</p>
            <p>But now the Mention of the Infant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive brings to my Remembrance the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of that Captivity, which are, to uſe Mr. <hi>Cimberton</hi>'s Expreſſion, pregnant with Abſurdity. <hi>Indiana,</hi> it ſeems, with her Mother and her Aunt, are taken, in their Paſſage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> by a Privateer from <hi>Toulon,</hi> and carried into that Place. Now
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0127703400:52"/>
where were they taken? It muſt be either in the Channel, or on the Ocean. Now, in the firſt place, I never heard that <hi>Toulon</hi> ſet out any Privateers. Secondly, Suppoſe they did, 'tis improbable that a Privateer from <hi>Toulon</hi> ſhould cruize in the Ocean, and much more improbable that they ſhould rove as far as the Channel. Thirdly, 'Tis highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Veſſel, which had Force enough to venture without a Convoy, ſhould be taken by a Privateer. Fourthly, 'Tis not a Jot more probable, that ſuppoſing a Privateer from <hi>Toulon</hi> ſhould have taken ſuch a Veſſel, it ſhould chuſe to carry it into <hi>Toulon,</hi> rather than into <hi>Breſt,</hi> or <hi>St. Malo.</hi> For how long muſt a Privateer be carrying an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Veſſel from the Channel to <hi>Toulon,</hi> which is above a thouſand Miles from the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and little leſs diſtant from that Part of the Ocean o'er which our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships paſs. Now in ſo long a Voyage, the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer might very well be taken, and the Prize be retaken; whereas the latter might be carried to <hi>Breſt,</hi> or <hi>St. Malo,</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Times leſs Danger.</p>
            <p>Well! But let us ſuppoſe the Privateer got ſafely with his Prize into <hi>Toulon.</hi> Does Sir <hi>Richard</hi> believe, that <hi>Toulon</hi> is ſituate under one of the Poles, that neither Ship nor Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were heard of in ſo many Years. If <hi>Indiana</hi> was an Infant, <hi>Iſabella</hi> was old enough to write; and if ſhe was ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0127703400:53"/>
or ſtupid as to omit it, the Captain of the Ship and his Mate would not fail to write to their Owners, to let them know the Fate of their Ship. If there was no Paſſage for Letters directly thro' <hi>France,</hi> yet the Way of <hi>Holland</hi> was open, and upon the Arrival of thoſe Letters, not only the whole <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, but all <hi>London</hi> would have known what was become of the Ship, at a Time when ſo many News-Writers contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which could furniſh the Town with moſt and the freſheſt News. So that if <hi>Sealand,</hi> upon his coming from the <hi>Indies,</hi> had made but never ſo little Enquiry, he would have found that his Siſter and Daughter had been at <hi>Toulon:</hi> If he had made no Enquiry, he muſt have ſhewn himſelf a fine Gentleman, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who would marry a ſecond Wife before he was certain the firſt was dead: And it is impoſſible he could know that the firſt was dead, without knowing that his Siſter and his Daughter were at <hi>Toulon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now compare the Relation that old <hi>Bevil</hi> makes to his Man <hi>Humphrey,</hi> in the firſt Scene of the <hi>Conſcious Lovers,</hi> to that which <hi>Simo</hi> makes to <hi>Soſia</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Andria:</hi> But I ſhall only compare them at preſent with relation to the Incidents; I ſhall take an Oportunity afterwards to conſider the Sentiments and Expreſſions by themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0127703400:54"/>
The beginning of the <hi>Andria</hi> is perfectly in Nature: <hi>Simo</hi> begins the Relation which he makes to <hi>Soſia</hi> with a grave and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Air, ſuitable to the Diſpoſition of Mind he is in, and the great Concern he is under: Old <hi>Bevil,</hi> who is ſuppos'd to be in the ſame Diſpoſition of Mind, and to lie under the ſame Concern, begins the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he makes to <hi>Humphrey</hi> with an Impertinence dully gay; and therefore the beginning of the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Andria, Chremes,</hi> a rich old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Citizen, offers to beſtow his only Daughter <hi>Philumena</hi> with a great Dowry on <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Simo,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that Offer for his Son. The Match breaks off upon the Diſcovery which <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> makes at the Funeral of <hi>Chryſis</hi> of his Paſſion for <hi>Glycerium. Simo</hi> the Father pretends that it ſtill goes on, that he may take an Opportunity, from his Son's Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, of giving him a ſevere Reprimand:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere,</l>
               <l>Ea primum ab illo animadvertenda Injuria eſt,</l>
               <l>Et nunc id operam do, ut per falſas Nuptias</l>
               <l>Vera objurgandi Cauſa ſit, ſi deneget.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In the beginning of the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> there is a very abſurd Imitation of this Paſſage in <hi>Terence:</hi> Where old <hi>Bevil</hi> ſpeaks
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0127703400:55"/>
thus to his Man <hi>Humphrey,</hi> concerning his Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If there is ſo much in this Amour of his, that he denies upon my Summons to marry, I ſhall have Cauſe enough to be offended: And then by inſiſting upon his marrying to Day, I ſhall know how far he is engag'd to the Lady in Maſquerade, and from thence only ſhall be able to take my Meaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it ſeems plain to me, that <hi>Simo</hi> would have reaſon to be angry at his Son's Refuſal, and that old <hi>Bevil</hi> would have none. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> would refuſe a Wife with a great Dowry, which he wanted, having nothing but what his Father ſupply'd him with, who, perhaps, might not be very eaſy in his own Circumſtances. Beſides, <hi>Glyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> paſs'd for a Courtezan, (which was not the Caſe of <hi>Indiana,</hi>) becauſe ſhe was believ'd to be the Siſter of <hi>Chryſis,</hi> who was publickly known to be one. And it would provoke any Father of a good Family, and who had all along liv'd with Reputation in the World, to find, to the Ruin and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of that Family, his only Son married to a Whore, or living with her as if he were married to her, which was againſt both Law and Cuſtom at <hi>Athens,</hi> and a great deal more ſcandalous there, than it is in this Bleſſed Town, as is evident from what <hi>Simo</hi> ſays in that admirable Scence which is between him and his Son and <hi>Chremes,</hi> in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0127703400:56"/>
the fifth Act of this Comedy, where Nature is drawn with ſuch maſterly Strokes, and in ſuch lively and glowing Colours.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Adeo n'impotentieſſe animo, ut praeter Civium</l>
               <l>Morem, atque legem, &amp; ſui voluntatem patris,</l>
               <l>Tamen hanc habere ſtudeat cum ſummo probro.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But 'tis downright ridiculous in old <hi>Bevil</hi> to pretend to be offended, in Caſe his Son who is in Poſſeſſion of a great Eſtate, and entirely independant on his Father, and one whom the Father himſelf calls a ſober and diſcreet Gentleman, ſhould refuſe to marry at a Minute's Warning a Woman whom he does not like, and whom the Father chuſes only with the ſordid View of doubling a great Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, when what they had already was more than ſufficient: Becauſe the Father is ſordid, muſt the Son be unhappy? Muſt the Son, who has beſpoke a Diſh for himſelf, take up with another that is his Averſion, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Father chooſes it? The Paſſion which young <hi>Bevil</hi> had for another, is a juſt Cauſe of his Refuſal; and if his Father is unreaſonably offended, the Son, who has no Dependance upon him, may very reaſonably be comforted. As the Father knew very well that the Son had no Occaſion for the Wealth which would come from the marrying <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda,</hi> ſo he did not believe his frequenting <hi>Indiana,</hi> whether he ſuppos'd her an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0127703400:57"/>
or a kept Miſtreſs, would bring any Scandal either upon himſelf or his Family. Witneſs what he ſays to <hi>Sealand</hi> in <hi>Act</hi> 4 <hi>Page</hi> 62 concerning this very Affair, <hi>viz. Sir, I can't help ſaying, that what might injure a Citizen's Credit may be no Stain to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Honour.</hi> So that 'tis plain <hi>Simo</hi> had two important Reaſons to be offended at his Son's Refufal, which old <hi>Bevil</hi> apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had not; becauſe he rejected Wealth, which he wanted; and courted Infamy, for which no one can have an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Relation of what paſſed between young <hi>Bevil</hi> and <hi>Indiana</hi> at the Maſquerade, is a very abſurd Imitation of what paſſed between <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Glycerium</hi> at the Funeral of <hi>Chryſis. Pamphilus</hi> attends <hi>Glycerium</hi> to the Funeral of <hi>Chryſis,</hi> who paſs'd for her Siſter. While the Body was burning, <hi>Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerium</hi> in the Agony of her Grief, ran to the Fire, and was about to throw herſelf into it, when <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> half dead with Fear, runs to her, catches hold of her, throws his Arms about her, and by that Action, and his tender Expoſtulation diſcovers the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that Paſſion which he had hitherto conceal'd; upon which <hi>Glycerium,</hi> by an Action which manifeſted her habitual Love, weeping reclin'd her Head upon his Breaſt with a moſt moving Tenderneſs. This is the Senſe of that celebrated Paſſage: But is but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0127703400:58"/>
barely the Senſe; for no Pen, no Tongue can expreſs the Elegance and the Grace of <hi>Terence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let us ſee the Imitation of this in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers:</hi> 'Tis in the firſt Scene of the Play, where old <hi>Bevil</hi> relates to his Man <hi>Hump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ey</hi> what paſſed at the laſt Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir J. Bevil.</speaker>
               <p>You know, I was laſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> at the Maſquerade; my Son, you may remember, ſoon found us out. He knew his Grandfather's Habit, which I then wore; and tho' it was the Mode, in the laſt Age, yet the Maskers, you know, follow'd us as if we had been the moſt monſtrous Figures in the whole Aſſembly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humphrey.</speaker>
               <p>I remember, indeed, a young Man of Quality in the Habit of a Clown, that was particularly trouble ſome.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir J. Bevil.</speaker>
               <p>Right: He was too much what he ſeemed to be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Humphrey.</speaker>
               <p>I knew he had a Mind to come to that Particular. <stage>[Aſide.</stage>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir J. Bevil.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, he followed us, till the Gentleman, who led the Lady in the <hi>Indian</hi> Mantle, preſented that gay Creature to the Ruſtick, and bid him (like <hi>Cymon</hi> in the Fable) grow polite, by falling in Love, and let that worthy old Gentleman alone, meaning me. The Clown was not reform'd, but rudely perſiſted, and offer'd to force off my Mask; with that the Gentleman, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his own, appear'd to be my Son; and in his Concern for me, tore off that of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0127703400:59"/>
At this they ſeiz'd each other: The Company called the Guards, and in the Surpriſe the Lady ſwooned away; upon which my Son quitted his Adverſary, and had now no Care but of the Lady; when rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her in his Arms, art thou gone, cried he, for ever—Forbid it Heaven!—She revives at his known Voice,—and with the moſt familiar, tho' modeſt Geſture, hangs in Safety over his Shoulder, weeping; but wept as in the Arms of one before whom ſhe could give herſelf a Looſe, were ſhe not under Obſervation: while ſhe hides her Face in his Neck, he carefully conveys her from the Company.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Now there is this remarkable Difference between what paſs'd at the Funeral, and what paſs'd at the Maſquerade, that every Thing that relates to the former, ſeems to be either neceſſary or profitable; and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that relates to the latter, appears to be improbable. How injudicious an Imitation is the Behaviour of <hi>Indiana</hi> at the Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, of the Behaviour of <hi>Glycerium</hi> at the Funeral. Nothing can be more natural than the Freedom which <hi>Glycerium</hi> takes with <hi>Pamphilus.</hi> She lov'd him, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by him: She was betroth'd to him; She had no Reſerve for him: The utmoſt Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities had paſs'd between them: She was with Child by him, and expected every Day
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0127703400:60"/>
that the Time of her being deliver'd was come.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of <hi>Indiana</hi> is very different, and her Behaviour is very inconſiſtent with her Character; 'tis true, ſhe was in Love with young <hi>Bevil,</hi> but doubted very much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Love was reciprocal; he had been ſo far from taking the ſame Liberty with her that <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had done with <hi>Glycerium,</hi> that his Behaviour had been always very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful; and yet <hi>Indiana</hi> uſes the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity upon this Occaſion with him, that <hi>Glycerium</hi> at the Funeral does with <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>; ſhe revives at his known Voice, which ſhe heard, it ſeems, after ſhe had loſt all her Senſes, and comes from Death to Life upon it, like the dead Men in the <hi>Rehearſal</hi> at the Voice of Poet <hi>Bays,</hi> and with the moſt familiar, tho' modeſt Geſture, hangs in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over his Shoulder weeping, but wept as in the Arms of one before whom ſhe could give herſelf a Looſe, were ſhe not under Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and while ſhe hides her Face in his Neck, he carefully conveys her from the Company.</p>
            <p>Now this Behaviour is by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Character of <hi>Indiana</hi>; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and modeſt are not in this Caſe very compatible; and then what does Sir <hi>Richard</hi> mean by <hi>wept as in the Arms of one before whom ſhe could give herſelf a Looſe?</hi> If theſe Words have any Meaning, I would fain know what it is.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Thus have I gone thro' the whole Train of Incidents, which are a Heap of Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Inconſiſtences. I have partly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gone thro' the Character of young <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> who is made up of Contradictions. He is one who differs from himſelf as much as from the reſt of the World. This Man of Conſcience and of Religion is as arrant an Hypocrite as a certain Author. 'Tis indeed a pleaſant Religion that never ſeizes a Man but when he is upon the Point either of Love
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0127703400:62"/>
or Battle: This Man of Conſcience and of Religion diſſembles with his Father moſt vilely, which Religion doth by no means allow, and ſo chuſes rather to offend Heaven than an old ſordid Blockhead, who pretends to treat one who is independent of him, and at Years of Diſcretion, like an arrant Boy; yet this the Son calls an honeſt Diſſimulation, as he calls Breach of Truſt the getting over a falſe Point of Honour. In the firſt Scene of the ſecond Act this Man of Religion is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Myrtle</hi> upon a Fraud, and palming two counterfeit Lawyers upon old Mrs. <hi>Sealand,</hi> a Practice which Religion and Morality both abhor.</p>
            <p>The Character of young <hi>Bevil</hi> therefore is made up of Qualities, either incoherent and contradictory, as Religion and Diſſimulation, Morality and Fraud; or moſt ridiculouſly conſiſtent, as Circumſpection and Folly. For one may ſay the ſame thing of young <hi>Bevil</hi> that <hi>Scandal</hi> in <hi>Love for Love</hi> ſays of and to <hi>Foreſight, That if ever he commits an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, 'tis not without a great deal of Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Circumſpection and Caution.</hi> The Character therefore of young <hi>Bevil</hi> is not an Image of any thing in Life, and eſpecially in common Life, as every thing in Comedy ought to be, but the Phantom of a feveriſh Author's Brain, as ſeveral of the other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters likewiſe are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0127703400:63"/>
As young <hi>Bevil</hi> is the Character of ſuch a young Man as is not to be found in the World, upon the foot of Nature, of which all true Poetry is a juſt Imitation, <hi>Cimberton</hi> is a Creature who is ſet as much below Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as <hi>Bevil</hi> appears to be drawn above it; he is an Animal that is nothing ſo like a Man as a Monkey is, nor is he near ſo well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to entertain a Lady agreeably; he is ſo very monſtrous, that one would not think he could be produced by any thing that had hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Shape, and for the Credit of Human Nature ought, like a <hi>Sooterkin,</hi> to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as ſoon as he appears.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the other Characters are faintly and coarſly drawn, which is very ſtrange, if we conſider the admirable Patterns that <hi>Terence</hi> has laid before him. The Characters of that Comick Poet I muſt confeſs are in no great Compaſs, but tho' they are few they are excellent; they are ſo ſtrong in Nature, that they may be taken for the Life, may be taken for Perſons rather than Pictures, and for real rather than dramatick Perſons. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſeems to be wholly ignorant of what <hi>Boileau</hi> has ſaid of this Matter, who is one of the greateſt of the <hi>French</hi> Poets, and one of the juſteſt of their Criticks.</p>

You would ſwear that you had before you the Things themſelves, inſtead of a good Picture and a juſt Reſemblance; you would ſwear you had before you a real Lover, a real Son, and a real Father.</q>
            <p>The very Character of <hi>Simo</hi> in the <hi>Andria</hi> is admirable, and the Relation he makes to <hi>Soſia</hi> a Maſterpiece; I never read it but I ſee the old <hi>Athenian</hi> before my Eyes in the very ſame Colours that <hi>Davus</hi> paints <hi>Crito</hi> the <hi>Andrian</hi> in the ſame Comedy.</p>

Whatever he ſays goes to my Heart; whereas old <hi>Bevil</hi> is an old fribling Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and that which comes from him ſcarce touches my Lips.</p>
            <p>But if in this Imitation of that Relation which <hi>Simo</hi> makes to <hi>Soſia,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard</hi> falls ſo very much ſhort of <hi>Terence</hi> in his Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and his Characters, he is inexpreſſible Degrees below him in his Sentiments and his Dialogue.</p>
            <p>The Sentiments of <hi>Terence</hi> are always true, are always juſt, and adapted to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; His Dialogue is the moſt charming that is to be found among the <hi>Roman</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: Where is there that Purity, that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, that Delicacy, that Grace, that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? If it has any Fault, 'tis too uniform a Politeneſs; the Servant ſpeaking always with the ſame Grace and the ſame Elegance that his Maſter does. Setting that aſide, 'tis every way accompliſh'd: It has particularly for its Purity the Authorities of two of the beſt and greateſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Judges, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> and <hi>Cicero. Cicero</hi> ſays of this Comick Poet, that he is <hi>optimus Author Latinitatis</hi>; and all the World has ſeen the Verſes that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> made upon the ſame Author.</p>

But now the Sentiments in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> are often frivolous, falſe, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; the Dialogue is awkard, clumſy, and ſpiritleſs; the Diction affected, impure, and barbarous, and too often <hi>Hibernian.</hi> Who, that is concern'd for the Honour of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, can ſee without Indignation whole Crowds of his Countrymen aſſembled to hear a Parcel of <hi>Teagues</hi> talking <hi>Tipperary</hi> together, and applauding what they ſay. I know very well that what I now ſay will alarm ſome People, and for that reaſon I ſhall ſhortly bring Examples of the Sentiments and the Diction in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers</hi> ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and ſo flagrant, that they ſhall juſtify me in ſpight of the Obſtinacy and the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his moſt fooliſh Admirers.</p>
