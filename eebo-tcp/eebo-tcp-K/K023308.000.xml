            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of 1783 I publiſhed a book or pamphlet, intitled, "Remarks, critical and illuſtrative, on the Text and Notes of the laſt Edition of Shakſpeare," which, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, has been repreſented as the moſt incorrect publication that ever appeared; and, indeed, from the liſt of <hi>errata</hi> in the book itſelf, and the additional one given at the end of this Preface, the charge does not ſeem to be without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is, however, one work which, I believe, may vye with mine in point of inaccuracy, and that is the reviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed edition of Johnſon and Steevenses Shakſpeare, which has ſince made its immaculate appearance, without the notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſingle error <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>A complete table of <hi>errata</hi> would be too arduous a taſk, perhaps, for an individual; the bookſellers may therefor think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to any perſon that will contribute to it. I accordingly offer my mite, in the following brief but decent ſpecimen of the accuracy of this famous edition.</p>

               </note>. I am, nevertheleſs, far from
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1108800300:3"/>meaning to reproach the learned gentleman who appears to have had the care of that edition, with the negligence of his printers; nor do I think myſelf at all more culpable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the blunders of mine. Every perſon who has the entire reviſion of his own preſs-work will be ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that nothing is ſo truly incorrigible as <hi>a virgin proof ſheet in its primitive ſtate of unamendment.</hi> There is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſome little difference in printers; elſe mercy on the poor author!</p>
            <p>Another charge which has been brought againſt me, is no leſs than downright <hi>felony.</hi> It ſeems that ſome of my happieſt emendations had already appeared in the margin of the very edition I had preſumed to criticiſe; and the candour of the Critical Reviewers led them to conclude that I muſt have ſtole them ready made. Thoſe venerable perſonages, who have the diſintereſtedneſs to devote ſix days
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:1108800300:4"/>in ſeven <note n="*" place="bottom">I conclude, that on <hi>Sunday</hi> the worthy critics "reſt from their labours," and go to <hi>Meeting.</hi> They are very good Chriſtians.</note> to the ſervice of the public, in paſſing ſentence upon books which they never read, and on the character of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers whom they do not know, could not for their ſouls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that two perſons might happen to hit upon the ſame idea, or that one, having poſſeſſed himſelf of the idea of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, might, from a defective memory, or any other cauſe, come in time to imagine it his own. All that I can ſay upon this head, though I ſhall not expect credit for my aſſertion from the good-natured gentlemen I have juſt mentioned, is, that at the time of the publication of the book, I was not aware of being anticipated in more than a ſingle inſtance, and even that one I thought my own.</p>
            <p>Incorrect, however, and felonious as theſe ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks might be, I found that the reviſed Edition I have mentioned had got near 200 of them in its margin, all of which were received without oppoſition; not to ſpeak of the alterations or corrections which I had a right to preſume myſelf the occaſion of. There are a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which have not paſſed muſter, but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are treated with ſuch an air of peeviſhneſs, that I eſteem myſelf a very unnatural father of ſo hopeful an off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, in not having come forward in their vindication ſooner. It will be thought, perhaps, by ſome, altogether unreaſonable, that, after the editor of the reviſed edition has adopted ſo conſiderable a majority of my remarks, I ſhould be diſpoſed to find ſault with him for his cavalier treatment of a few. I can only ſay, that is was not to me of the ſmalleſt conſequence whether he condeſcended to honour my publication with his notice or not; but I think it my duty to defend every part of it from injury and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation. I know of no difference between the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity or character of a writer and that of any other indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual; nor ought an unjuſt charge againſt the former to remain unrefuted, any more than one againſt the latter.
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:1108800300:5"/>"This defence, I allow, is rather of the lateſt in making its appearance, and my liberal and candid friends above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned will ſcarcely neglect the opportunity of paying my prudence a compliment, in having attended ſo well to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races rule. The fact is, that my notes were taken in turning over the reviſed edition immediately after its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, but have till very lately been laid aſide, and, in ſhort, almoſt forgotten; and perhaps I only anticipate a pleaſant obſervation of my ſmall friends, ſo oft alluded to, in adding, that it would have proved no great loſs if they had been altogether ſo.</p>
            <p>I muſt not pretend to be ignorant that I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of treating the moſt eminent Editors, Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Critics, with too little ceremory; and, indeed,
<q>
                  <l>I fear I've wrong'd the honorable men</l>
                  <l>Whoſe gooſe-quills have ſtabb'd Shakſpeare.</l>
               </q>
"If it be ſo," it is unqueſtionably "a grievous fault." But I can with great truth and juſtice urge in my defence, that
<q>
                  <l>I have no perſonal cauſe to ſpurn at them.</l>
                  <l>But for the general.</l>
               </q>
And that
<q>
                  <l>How far I have proceeded in this matter,</l>
                  <l>Or how far further ſhall, is warranted</l>
                  <l>By the example of preceeding critics,</l>
                  <l>Yea, the whole critic tribe.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave to aſſure the reſpectable gentleman who had the care of the reviſed edition, that ſo far from meaning to treat him with the ſlighteſt degree of levity or freedom, I do not conſider him as reſponſible for any one of the notes which are the principal objects of the preſent pamphlet: I conclude them to have been furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome obliging friend, who has deſired to be effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:1108800300:6"/>concealed under the ſanction of the Editors ſignature <note n="*" place="bottom">This worthy gentleman is probably the infamous ſcoundrel who publiſhed "An Addreſs to the curious in ancient poetry," as, however little relation it may have to Shakſpeare, the author has had intereſt enough to procure it a place in the "Liſt of Detached Pieces of Criticiſm, &amp;c." prefixed to the reviſed edition. A congeniality of diſpoſition in the Critical Reviewers procured this fellow a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reception from thoſe literary hangmen, from that which he may one day experience from a well known practical profeſſor of the ſame myſtery.</note> If I could poſſibly think this were not the caſe, I am under too many obligations to that gentleman, in the courſe of my different literary purſuits, not to have kiſſed the rod in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. However, I doubt not there are many things in the following pages which I might have been allowed to ſay, without running any poſſible riſk of giving offence to him; alive as an editor is on ſuch occaſions ſaid to feel himſelf.</p>
            <p>At the end of the <hi>Remarks,</hi> &amp;c. I inſerted an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of "an edition of the plays of Shakſpeare," as then "preparing for the preſs;" and ſome enquiries have been made when it would appear. In truth, the attention requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the publication of ſo voluminous a work, and the little likelihood there is of its being productive to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker of any thing but trouble and expence, together with other cauſes of leſs conſequence, have hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred me from putting it to the preſs. But I have neither laid aſide all thoughts of bringing it forward, nor can I pledge myſelf to produce it in any given time. I have little reaſon to ſuppoſe that the Public intereſts itſelf at all in the matter, and therefor think myſelf at full liberty to ſuit my own inclination and convenience.</p>

               <p>Vol. I. p. 155 <note n="*" place="bottom">The paging in this pamphlet is generally from the reviſed edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>.</p>
               <p>IN anſwer to what I have been pleaſed to aſſert in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Shakſpeare, <note place="margin">REMARKS. p. 7.</note> againſt the charge of taking a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with his words, by ſtretching them out to ſuit the purpoſe of his metre, Mr. Tyrwhitt has obſerved as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: "As to this <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> canon of the Engliſh language, it would be eaſy to ſhew that it is quite fanciful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; and what he calls <hi>the right method of printing the above words,</hi> is ſuch as, I believe, was never adopted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by any mortal in writing them, nor can be followed in the pronunciation of them, without the help of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new ſyſtem of ſpelling. But any further diſcuſſion of the matter is unneceſſary; becauſe the hypotheſis, though allowed in its utmoſt extent, will not prove either of the points to which it is applied. It will neither prove that Shakſpeare has not taken a liberty in extending cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words, nor, that he has not taken that liberty chiefly with certain words in which <hi>l</hi> or <hi>r</hi> is ſubjoined to another conſonant. The following are all inſtances of nouns, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive or adjective, which can receive no ſupport from the ſuppoſed canon. That Shakſpeare has taken a liberty in extending theſe words, is evident, from the conſideration
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1108800300:9"/>that the ſame words are more frequently uſed by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, and by himſelf, without the additional ſyllable. Why he has taken this liberty with words in which <hi>l</hi> or <hi>r</hi> is ſubjoined, muſt be obvious to every one who can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the language.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The learned and reſpectable writer of theſe obſervations is now unfortunately no more; but his opinions will not on that account have the leſs influence with the readers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed edition of Shakſpeare. I am therefor ſtill at liberty to enforce the juſtice and propriety of my own ſentiments, which I truſt I ſhall be found to do with all poſſible deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy toward the memory and character of the ingenious gentleman from whom I have the misfortune to differ.</p>
               <p>I humbly conceive, that upon more mature conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Mr. Tyrwhitt would have admitted, that if the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of printing the words in queſtion were once proved to be right, it would be of little conſequence whether the diſcovery had ever been adopted before, or could be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pronunciation, without the help of an entire new ſyſtem of ſpelling: which in fact is the very object I mean to contend for; or rather for <hi>a ſyſtem of ſpelling,</hi> as I am perfectly confident we have none at preſent, or at leaſt I have never been able to find it. I ſhall have reaſon to think myſelf peculiarly unfortunate if, after my hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is allowed in its utmoſt extent, it will not prove what it was principally formed to do, viz. that Shakſpeare has not taken a liberty in extending certain words to ſuit the purpoſe of his metre. But ſurely, if I prove that he has only written the words in queſtion as they ought to be written, I prove the whole of my poſition, which of courſe ſhould ceaſe to be termed or conſidered an hypotheſis. I may ſafely admit, that the words in queſtion "are more frequently uſed by his contemporaries, and by himſelf, without the additional ſyllable;" but this will only ſhew, that his contemporaries and himſelf have more frequently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1108800300:11"/>taken the liberty of ſhortening thoſe words than in writing them at length. Such a word as <hi>alarm'd,</hi> for inſtance, is generally, perhaps conſtantly, uſed by poets as a diſſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable; and yet, if we found it with its full power, <hi>alarmed,</hi> we ſhould ſcarcely ſay that the writer had taken a liberty in lengthening it a ſyllable. Thus too the word <hi>diamond</hi> is generally ſpoken as if two ſyllables; but it is certainly three, and is ſo properly given by Shakſpeare:
<q>Sir, I muſt have that <hi>diamond</hi> from you.</q>
The words <hi>obſervation</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> are uſually pronounced, the one as conſiſting of three, the other of four ſyllables; but each, notwithſtanding, is really a ſyllable longer:
<q>
                     <l>With <hi>obſervation,</hi> the which he vents.</l>
                     <l>Yet have I fierce <hi>affections</hi> and think.</l>
                  </q>
But examples of this nature would be endleſs.</p>
               <p>Of the words quoted by Mr. Tyrwhitt, as inſtances of the liberty taken by Shakſpeare, thoſe which I admit to be properly a ſyllable ſhorter, certainly obtained the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation in the age of that author as he has annexed to them. Thus <hi>country, monſtrous, remembrance, aſſembly,</hi> were not only pronounced in Shakſpeares time, the two former as <hi>three,</hi> the other as <hi>four</hi> ſyllables, but <hi>are ſo ſtill;</hi> and the reaſon, to borrow Mr. Tyrwhitts own words, "muſt be obvious to every one who can pronounce the language."</p>
               <p>"<hi>Henry</hi> was not only uſually pronounced (as indeed it is ſtill) but frequently written as a triſyllable, even in proſe. Thus in Dr. Huttons Diſcourſe on the Antiquities of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, at the end of Hearnes <hi>Textus Roffenſis,</hi>
                  <q>King <hi>Henery</hi> the eights colledge<note n="*" place="bottom">See, upon this ſubject, <hi>Walliſii Grammatica,</hi> p. 57.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That Mr. Tyrwhitt ſhould have treated the words <hi>angry, humbler, nobler,</hi> uſed as triſyllables, among thoſe which could "receive no ſupport from the ſuppoſed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non," muſt have been owing to the obſcure or imperfect manner in which I attempted to explain it, as theſe are the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1108800300:12"/>very inſtances which the canon, if a canon it muſt be, is purpoſely made to ſupport, or rather by which it is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. This canon, in ſhort, is nothing but a very ſhort and ſimple rule of Engliſh grammar, which has been repeated over and over: Every word, compounded upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Engliſh language, always preſerves the radical word unchanged. Thus <hi>humbler</hi> and <hi>nobler,</hi> for inſtance, are compoſed of the adjectives <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>noble,</hi> and <hi>er,</hi> the ſign of the comparative degree; <hi>angry,</hi> of the noun <hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>y,</hi> the Saxon ig. In the uſe of all theſe as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllables Shakſpeare is moſt correct; and that he is no leſs ſo in <hi>England,</hi> which uſed to be pronounced as three ſyllables, and is ſo ſtill indeed with thoſe who do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the pronunciation of their mother-tongue from the book, and ſpeech certainly preceded writing, will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the etymology, which ſhould be more and attended to. Let us examine the word.—How is it to be divided? <hi>Eng-land,</hi> or <hi>En-gland?</hi> It will be evident that there is a defect ſomewhere: but write it as it ſhould be written, <hi>En-gle-land,</hi> and you have the meaning and etymology of the word and the origin of the nation at firſt ſight, from the Saxon Englalanda, the land or country of the <hi>Angles;</hi> as in <hi>Scotland, Ireland, Finland, Lapland,</hi> the country of the <hi>Scot,</hi> the Ine, the <hi>Fin,</hi> the <hi>Lap:</hi> and yet, in deſpite of all ſenſe and reaſon, about half the words in the language are in the ſame awkward predicament.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf I have completely juſtified this divine author from the charge of racking his words, as the tyrant did his captives. I hope too I have made it appear, that there is ſomething defective and improper in the common methods of ſpelling, or rather mis-ſpelling. A learned and ingenious gentleman, who has undertaken a New Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary of the language upon an excellent plan, will have it very much in his power to introduce a ſyſtematical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, which, once eſtabliſhed, would remain unvaried and invariable as long as the language endured. This John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might have had the honour of; but it is evident that he was very little acquainted with the principles and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1108800300:13"/>of the words he undertook to explain. Every dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, to be perfect, ſhould diſplay a ſyſtem of orthogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, by dividing the words upon etymological principles. At firſt ſight, one would think there was very little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in this; and yet I know not that any grammarian or lexicographer has attempted it. Something of this kind has been effected in Italy, France, and Spain, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent academies there. And however violent the propoſed reform may appear, it is certain, that if two or three of the firſt printers in London were to adopt it, it would ceaſe to be remarkable in half a year: but till this is done, it does not ſeem worth the while of an individual to render <hi>his ſelf</hi> ſingular, when he cannot ſee the leaſt probability of being able to convince the public of the propriety of his conduct; and there ſeems no neceſſity for making ſuch a matter as <hi>this</hi> a point of conſcience.</p>

They have, however, been objected to, and we are poſitively told, that Maſter Slenders "Edward ſhovel-boards have <hi>undoubtedly</hi> been <hi>broad ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Edward the Third.</hi> I believe the broad ſhillings of that monarch were never before heard of, as he <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly</hi> did not coin any ſhilling whatever."</p>
               <p>Without attempting to palliate the groſs blunder I was <hi>undoubtedly</hi> guilty of in the remark alluded to, I may be permitted to obſerve, that neither "Dr. Farmers note," nor "the authority he quotes," was cenſured in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, unleſs difference in opinion neceſſarily imply cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. No one can have either leſs reaſon or leſs inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>cenſure</hi> this reſpectable ſcholar and critic than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and I am confident that <hi>he</hi> would never have thought it neceſſary to defend either his notes or his authorities in ſuch a ſtile as the above. By whom the Engliſh ſhilling was firſt coined, is a piece of knowledge from which the poſſeſſor can derive ſo little merit, that I ſhould think my pleaſant and gentlemanlike friend in the dark will ſcarcely diſpute my having had opportunities of acquiring it: how I happened to make ſo ill a uſe of them is another matter; which I can neither apologiſe nor account for. And though I do not think the inaccuracy or inattention of one writer is any excuſe for that of another, I may be permitted to notice a few ſimilar ſlips, to prove my offence is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its parallels.</p>

It was certainly the faſhion in Shakſpeares time, and perhaps long after, for ladies to wear maſks; and as Iſabella is about to take the veil, it may be probable that ſhe could not conſiſtently walk through the ſtreets without a maſk, which, on coming into Angelos preſence, ſhe would of courſe hold in her hand.</p>
               <p>I am the rather confirmed that this is the true ſenſe of the paſſage, from the frequency of Shakſpeares alluſions to the cuſtom of wearing maſks.</p>

               <p>In reply to the remark on this paſſage, the gentleman who has aſſumed the ſignature of "The Editor," after la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the misfortune of the commentators and readers of Shakſpeare, in having ſo much of their time employed in explaining and contradicting unfounded conjectures and aſſertions, produces and extract from Mr. Wartons <hi>Obſervations on Spenſers Fairy Queen,</hi> to prove, that in Shakſpeares time the notion of Fairies dying was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known; and adds, that Tickells poem, called <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington Gardens,</hi> will ſhew that the opinion prevailed in the preſent century. A future editor of our author, he ſays, may, without any detriment to his work, omit this note, which he ſhould have been better pleaſed to have had no occaſion to incumber the page with.</p>
               <p>Every perſon of feeling muſt ſurely ſympathiſe with an editor of Shakſpeare, who, contrary to the eſtabliſhed practice of gentlemen in his ſituation, inſtead of the more agreeable employment of making unfounded conjectures and aſſertions, is reduced to the hard neceſſity of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting them; more eſpecially when, after all his toil and trouble, and writing about it and about it, the point is left pretty much the ſame as it was found. The real and oftenſible editor of the reviſed edition is a perſon of too extenſive reading, as well as of too much good ſenſe, to quote the fanciful genealogies of Spenſer, at ſecond hand, to illuſtrate a popular ſuperſtition, with which, as he well knows, the <hi>Faerie Queene</hi> has not the remoteſt connection. No one who has read even a ſingle canto of Spenſers poem, can be ignorant of the diſſimilarity between <hi>his</hi> Fairies and the Fairies of Shakſpeare; or that a ſyſtem, imagined to ſerve the purpoſes of allegory and alluſion to real characters, has nothing in common with the vulgar opinion, to which in fact he has not been indebted for a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1108800300:19"/>ſingle idea. Mr. Tickells poem I neither know where to find, nor think it worth my while to enquire after. I have ſuch authority, however, for what the above candid and good-tempered pſeudo-editor is pleaſed to call an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded conjecture and aſſertion, that, far from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to retract and iota of what I have already advanced on the ſubject, I will venture to maintain the propriety of my opinion in its fulleſt extent, viz. that the Fairies of Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare and the common people are immortal, and were never eſteemed otherwiſe. And, firſt, to ſhew how little Spenſer is to be regarded as an authority in the matter, it will be only neceſſary to have recourſe to the doctrine of that poets maſter, the inimitable Arioſto, who expreſsly tells us that a Fairy <hi>can not</hi> die:
<q>
                     <l>Morir non puote alcuna Fata mai,</l>

                  </q>
Pretty concluſive evidence this, one ſhould think! There is, indeed, a fooliſh Romance, intitled <hi>Huon de Bourdeaux,</hi> which had been turned into Engliſh long before Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeares time, where Oberon, king of the Fairies, is made to dye and bequeath his dominions to Huon. And Mr. Steevens (vol. iii. 135.) mentions his having been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the originals of Oberon and Titania are to be ſought in this romance. They may be there ſought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but I know, by woeful experience, they are not there to be found.</p>
               <p>Shakſpeare, I am convinced, was upon this occaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to no book whatever; unleſs it were the great book of ſociety, which he peruſed and ſtudied with ſo much care. And that he himſelf has expreſsly repreſented his Fairies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, will appear from the following quotations, which could only have eſcaped the notice of a ſuppoſititious editor, leſs attentive to his authors text than tenacious of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of his predeceſſors of himſelf.</p>

               <p>"The original and authentic copy," ſays Mr. Malone (as he is become fond of calling the <hi>firſt</hi> folio, ſince the <hi>ſecond</hi> has been the means of detecting ſo many of his miſtakes) "reads—with one <hi>ſelf</hi> king. <hi>Same,</hi>" he ſays, "was added unneceſſarily by the editor of the ſecond folio, who in many inſtances appears to have been equally ignorant of our authors language and metre." Though this charge were as true as it is otherwiſe; and though the editor of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond folio had underſtood our authors language and metre as imperfectly as the learned gentleman himſelf appears to do, the preſent alteration would be no inſtance of it. But ſee how this ingenious critic explains the paſſage! <hi>"Self king,"</hi> ſays he, "is <hi>king o'er HERſelf;</hi> one who reigns abſolute in her boſom." <hi>King o'er herſelf</hi> may, for any thing I know, be very good <hi>Iriſh;</hi> but on would think it ought to be <hi>Queen o'er herſelf,</hi> to make it good <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But, this by the way, I ſhould I ſhould be glad to know if it be poſſible for any perſon who has read but two lines of Shakſpeare; and has but two grains of common ſenſe, to betray ſtronger ſymptoms of a very imperfect acquaintance with his ſenſe, language, metre, or any thing elſe. As to the metre, the additional ſyllable, though not abſolutely neceſſary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is certainly an improvement; the word <hi>perfections</hi> muſt otherwiſe have been pronounced as four ſyllables,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1108800300:23"/>which, though not unuſual with Shakſpeare, is far from being harmonious. As to the ſenſe, that is left pretty much as it was: the compound <hi>ſelf-ſame</hi> had come into uſe in Shakſpeares time, inſtead of the ancient adjective <hi>ſelf:</hi> he uſes both frequently; as Mr. Malone, if he will take the trouble to read him over for the purpoſe, may for certainty know. And the meaning of the paſſage, if indeed it be at all neceſſary to explain what no one perhaps but Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can poſſibly miſconceive, is merely and ſimply this: when theſe ſovereign thrones, are all ſupplied and fill'd with <hi>one and the ſame king,</hi> i. e.

I have ſaid that it ſhould ſeem, from the play, that Malcolm was the <hi>firſt</hi> who had the title of <hi>prince of Cumberland;</hi> and ſo it does; though this was certainly not the caſe, as Malcolm, ſon of Donald VI. afterwards Malcolm I. is by the Scotiſh hiſtorians expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted to have born it in the reign of Conſtantine III.

As the line was before printed, he obſerves, the ſenſe was obſcure; which, as he, doubtleſs, means to himſelf, we may very readily believe. How this ſame daſh was to illumine the paſſage, we might however have ſtill been at a loſs to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if the ingenious commentator had not been pleaſed to explain it for the benefit of more opaque intellects; which he does as follows: "Your meſſage, you ſay, is to my lord of <hi>Hereford.</hi> My anſwer is—It is not to him; it is to the duke of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>" Now it is conceived that there was ſcarcely a ſingle reader of Shakſpeare, ſince he firſt begun to be read, excepting this ingenious gentleman, who could have heſitated a moment at the line as it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſtood.

               <p>In anſwer to the REMARK on this paſſage, the Editor of the reviſed edition, or rather his ſkulking friend, obſerves, that "it is probable that Dr. Johnſon did not ſee the neceſſity of citing any authority for a fact ſo well known, or ſuſpect that any perſon would demand one. If an authority how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever only is wanted," he ſays, "perhaps the following may be deemed ſufficient to juſtify the Doctors obſervation,—"at that time two other Engliſhmen, ſir W. Stanley and Rowland York, got an ignominious name of traytors, This Yorke, borne in London, was a man moſt negligent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1108800300:27"/>and lazy, but deſperately hardy; he was in his time the moſt famous of thoſe who reſpected fencing, having been <hi>the firſt</hi> that brought into England <hi>that wicked and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faſhion</hi> to fight in the fields in duels <hi>with a rapier called a tucke onely for the thurſt. The Engliſh having till that very time uſed to fight with backe ſwords, ſlaſhing and cutting one the other armed with targets or bucklers with very broad weapons, accounting it not to be a manly action to fight by thruſting and ſtabbing, and chiefly under the waſte." Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Annals of Queen Elizabeth,</hi> 4to, 1623, p. 223. ſub anno 1587.</p>
               <p>"Again, in <hi>Bulleines Dialogue between Soarneſſe and Chirurgi,</hi> fol. 1579, p. 20. "There is a <hi>new</hi> kynd of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to let bloud withall, whych brynge the bloud letter ſome tyme to the gallowes, becauſe hee ſtryketh to deepe. Theſe inſtruments are called the ruffins tucke and <hi>long foining rapier:</hi> weapons more malicious than manly."</p>
               <p>That Dr. Johnſon did not ſee the neceſſity of citing any authority to convict Shakſpeare of this anachroniſm, or ſuſpect that any perſon would demand one, is a little to the purpoſe as it is true that the fact is well known. If Dr. Johnſon had been poſſeſſed of any authority, there can be no doubt that he would have produced it; but, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever confident he may be in his aſſertions, no one was ever more ignorant of the manners either of Shakſpeares age or of the ages preceding it. But ignorant as he was, it would not have been difficult for him to have found autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which make as little in his favour as thoſe brought forward in the reviſed edition. Dr. Johnſon has taken upon himſelf to aſſert that the Rapier was a weapon not ſeen in England till 1599, that is, two centuries after the time of which Shakſpeare was writing, and two years after the publication of this identical play; an aſſertion which the author of the above note, out of his zeal for the credit of Dr. Johnſon, has pronounced a <hi>notorious fact,</hi> and produced what he calls a ſufficient authority to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1108800300:28"/>juſtify it. This authority, however, proves at moſt no more than that <hi>a rapier,</hi> called <hi>a tucke</hi> "onely for the thurſt," had been introduced by a perſon who was hanged in 1587, and that <hi>"the long foining rapier"</hi> was a new kind of inſtrument in 1579. The <hi>rapier</hi> NOT called a <hi>tucke,</hi> and for ſomething more than the <hi>thurſt</hi> or the <hi>long foin,</hi> might, for any thing that yet appears to the contrary, have been an ordinary weapon long before either Yorke <note n="*" place="bottom">It ſhould appear from Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>letons <hi>Thankful Remembrance of Gods Mercy,</hi> 1625, as quoted by Mr. Malone in the notes to the <hi>Merry Wives of Windſor</hi> (vol. i. p. 296) that York "was ..famous.. for bringing in a new kind of fight—to run the point of a <hi>rapier</hi> into a mans body. This manner of ſight <hi>he</hi> brought <hi>firſt</hi> into England, &amp;c." That is, as I underſtand it, he did not bring the rapier itſelf into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but only this new meanner of fighting with it.</note>, Bulleine, or Shakſpeare was born. But ſuppoſing it was not, what then? Shakſpeare could have made uſe of the word <hi>rapier</hi> as a general name for a <hi>ſword,</hi> the ſpecies for the genus; and Dr. Johnſon might with equal propriety have objected to Julius Caeſars ſpeaking Engliſh.</p>
               <p>Shakſpeare has ſo many anachroniſms to anſwer for, that ſome people ſeem to think it is no matter how many, real or pretended, they add to the number; which, as his ſincere admirer, I am anxious ſhould not be wantonly increaſed. I will not, indeed, aſſert, that the <hi>rapier</hi> was actually known in this country under that very name in the time of king Richard the Second; but I ſhall certainly think it ſufficient to prove, that it was familiar to us long before the time at which Shakſpeare wrote; and let Dr. Johnſons advocate ſhew why both the poet and his readers have not a right to preſume it was ſo in the times of which he was writing.</p>
               <p>The fact I take to be this: the ancient rapier was a long two-edged ſharp-pointed weapon, eſſentially different from that mentioned by Darcy and Bulleine, which was for the <hi>thruſt only,</hi> whereas the other was for <hi>both blow and thruſt.</hi> In a note to <hi>Much ado about Nothing</hi> (vol. ii. p.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1108800300:29"/>263.) Mr. Steevens produces an extract from an old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript in the Sloane Library, "which ſeems," he ſays, "to be the fragment of a regiſter formerly belonging to ſome of our ſchools, where the "noble Science of Defence was taught," from the year 1568 to 1583;" in which we find the following entry: "Item a challenge playde before the KINGS MAJESTIR (EDWARD VI.) at Weſtminſter.. at ſeven kynde of weapons. That is to ſay,... the RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIER and TARGET, the <hi>rapier</hi> and <hi>cloke,</hi> &amp;c." And in another place Mr. Steevens, giving an account of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, expreſsly tells us that RAPIER and TARGET, <hi>rapier</hi> and <hi>cloke, rapier</hi> and <hi>dagger,</hi> were among the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons uſed in the fencing ſchool. This I ſhould conceive a ſufficient and ſatisfactory proof, even to the gentleman who has ſo zealouſly undertaken to ſupport the random and groundleſs aſſertion of Dr. Johnſon, that the <hi>rapier</hi> alluded to by Shakſpeare was not <hi>a long foining tucke onely for the thurſte;</hi> and that he has not given "to the Engliſh nobles a weapon which was not ſeen in England till two centuries afterwards."</p>
               <p>Independent of this adventitious aſſiſtance, Shakſpeare himſelf has given ſuch a deſcription of the rapier he meant, as could ſcarcely be overlooked but by an annotator leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to illuſtrate his author than to ſupport the abſurdities of an editor. Thus in <hi>Twelfth Night</hi> (vol. iv. p. 254.)
<q>He is knight dubb'd with <hi>unhack'd rapier:</hi>
                  </q>

That the <hi>ſack.</hi> however, mentioned and meant by Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare is NOT the <hi>ſack</hi> of this day, will be evident to all but the Editor, by a paſſage in one of the notes to his own edition (vol. iv. p. 174.) where it is ſaid that <hi>Moll Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe,</hi> ("a notorious baggage that uſed to go in mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel") when brought up to do penance at Pauls Croſs, where ſhe "wept bitterly and ſeemed very penitent," was, it was afterwards doubted, maudlin drunk, having been "diſcovered to have tippel'd of THREE QUARTS OF SACK, before ſhe came to her penance." Let the Editor try if he can drink ONE QUART. Falſtaff himſelf puts the matter out of doubt, where, in his enumeration of the excellencies

               <p>The abſurdity of this reading is ſo evident, and has been ſo fully expoſed in the REMARKS, that one, editor or commentator, has had the confidence to ſay a ſingle word in defence of it, except Mr. Malone, whoſe candour and ingenuity are equally conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>He quotes a few words from a long note, where it was ſaid that "it is <hi>the Duke of Exeter</hi> who enters," and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly adds, that "in the only folio of authority this certainly is not the caſe;" becauſe forſooth the blundering editors have ſuffered the name of <hi>Fluellen</hi> to ſtand before a ſpeech evidently belonging to <hi>Exeter:</hi>
                  <q>Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions.</q>
Is this the language of <hi>Fluellen?</hi> Does <hi>Fluellen</hi> ever ſpeak in heroics? Or is it poſſible that this line, and the pitiful ſtuff which the editors have ſo judiciously preferred:— "'Splood!—up to the preaches, you raſcals! will you not up to the preaches?" can belong to one and the ſame perſon? Certainly not. But then, he argues, "when the king retired, the duke of Exeter undoubtedly accompanied him:" And ſuppoſe he did, what then? Is he never to come upon the ſtage again?</p>
               <p>As to his aſſertion, that "<hi>Duke</hi> means no more here than <hi>commander;</hi>" nothing bad enough can be ſaid of it. Will he have the goodneſs to produce on ſingle inſtance from "the language of our author," in which the title has any ſuch meaning? <hi>"Duke Theſeus,"</hi> every one who has looked into the <hi>Midſummer Nights Dream,</hi> not excepting himſelf, very well knows, is <hi>"Theſeus Duke of Athens."</hi> And though Skelton or any other ancient writer may have called

For this reaſon his Hiſtory is in many parts no more to be regarded than a Romance, as he neither does nor was able to quote any authority for what he relates. Among the many inſtances which might be adduced in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of theſe aſſertions, I ſhall only mention a remarkable anecdote of Colonel Kirk, who is ſuppoſed to have debauched a young woman, the ſiſter (but according to other, the wife) or one of the Weſtern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſtory Mr. Hume has worked up with all his powers of eloquence and pathos; and being ſo very intereſting, no doubt is ever entertained of its truth. Although in fact, ſo far as it regards Kirk or the reign of James the Second or the Engliſh hiſtory, it is an impudent and barefaced lye. Mr. Hume indeed was not the fabricator of the falſehood; but his conduct is not the more excuſable on that account, ſince he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to warrant it that could deſerve the name of an authority, and a ſtory that does outrage to human nature, ought not to be adopted by a hiſtorian without a voucher equal to its incredibility. The origin of the fable was probably owing to the <hi>pious fraud</hi> of the Whig party, to whom Kirk had rendered himſelf ſo odious, that they endeavour of to blacken his character with every action ſuperlatively abominable which they could find recorded. Many leſs important and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable calumnies remain unnoticed in the libels of the day; but this ſtory, and ſome other circumſtances mentioned by Mr. Hume, ſuch, as his hanging 19 without the leaſt enquiry into the merits of their cause, ordering a certain number to be executed, while he and his compan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1108800300:37"/>and obſcure: but though I have ſaid that the rupture between the king and his political creator is owing to cauſes which have not reached poſterity, I have ſince found that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1108800300:38"/>Warwick took occaſional umbrage at ſeveral of the kings proceedings: As, 1. his marrying the queens ſiſter to the duke of Buckingham; 2. his conferring the office of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer (which he had taken from the lord Montjoy) upon lord Rivers; 3. his making a match between the ſon and heir of the lord Herbert and Mary the queens ſiſter, and another between the young lord Liſle and the daughter of lord Herbert, and creating young Herbert a knight and lord of Dunſtar; 4. his making a match between ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gray, the queens ſon, and Lady Anne, daughter and heir to the duke of Exeter, and niece to the king, who had been talked of as a wife for the earl of Northumberland, Warwicks brother. But here the annals of William Wyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, to whom we are indebted for this valuable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, are moſt unfortunately defective. However, it appears from Rymer, that in the beginning of November 1469, no open variance had taken place between the king and Warwick; though the latter had certainly been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of favouring king Henry, and had ſecretly diſpleaſed the king by the propoſed match between his daughter and the duke of Clarence.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1108800300:39"/>it to be a quotation from the writings of a learned gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that name, with which they ſeem ſo very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, that it cannot give them much trouble to point out the particular book and page from whence it was taken; and this they will have a favorable opportunity of doing, in the courſe of the humane treatment my poor literary bant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here has a right to expect from the mercy of incenſed butchers. Theſe pious Chriſtians (poſſibly from their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this world being as nigh heaven or hell as a garret or a cellar can make it) ſeem to conſider themſelves as the public guardians of Religion, and are extremely apt to take the alarm at every thing in which they are quick-ſighted enough to perceive a reflection upon their ſacred charge. Poor fellows! one need not wonder at their anxiety, as they have moſt probably nothing elſe to loſe. In the mean time, every one who had looked over the notes to the laſt edition of Shakſpeare, would immediately ſee with what view the names of AMNER and COLLINS were adopted in the REMARKS.</p>
