            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING received from a worthy Friend in the country, for whom I have the greateſt eſteem, a printed paper, which had been ſent him by Dr. Kennicott, intituled, <q>A Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the <hi>Sacred Veſſels</hi> reſtored by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and of the <hi>Chief Jews</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at firſt from the Captivity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Names of the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Families,</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> of the Perſons at that Time in each Family; diſpoſed in ſuch a manner, as to ſhew
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1073800300:3"/>moſt clearly the great corruption of <hi>Proper Names</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Text of the Old-Teſtament;</q> and being deſired to return the ſaid paper when I had peruſed it, I thought I could not handſomely do ſo without ſending my opinion of it at the ſame time. The nature of the ſubject is indeed ſo foreign to my own buſineſs and way of life, that I ſhould ſcarcely have preſumed to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it, had not a point of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to this Gentleman firſt of all induced me to do ſo; but afterwards, when I had conſidered Dr. Kennicott's manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf in the title of this cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, I thought myſelf obliged, through a deſire of vindicating the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to apply as cloſely to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this charge againſt them, as my ſmall ſhare of leiſure would permit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehenſiſe that this paper might cauſe ſuch prejudices againſt the integrity of the Text of the Old-Teſtament, as the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1073800300:4"/>learned Author himſelf, perhaps, never conceived, and would be ſorry to have occaſioned by his catalogue.</p>
            <p>The Letter to my friend, which was the reſult of this examination, was at my deſire ſhewn to Dr. Kennicott; but the arguments therein had not ſufficient weight to convince him, that ſome apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy was neceſſary to be made to his friends, to prevent their miſinterpreting his real deſign in the ſaid catalogue, and to remove all appearance of his having charged <q>
                  <hi>the preſent Text of the Old-Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament</hi>
               </q> with more faults than it really deſerves. Not being able however to lay aſide my own apprehenſions of the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which might poſſibly be occaſioned by this catalogue, I have therefore ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to print ſome of my remarks upon it, leſt any perſon, not having leiſure to examine it ſufficiently, ſhould be led to conceive, that all the differences in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1073800300:5"/>names and numbers, found therein, are really corruptions <q>
                  <hi>in the preſent Text of the Old-Teſtament.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt part of the Catalogue the Doctor has compared Ezra's account of the ſacred veſſels with the account given of the ſame in the Book of Eſdras; and, as if he had <hi>clearly ſhewn</hi> thereby ſome great corruptions, he has affixed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing motto to his quotations; viz. <q>non poteſt verum aſſeri, quod
<note n="1" place="bottom">
                     <p>(1) In the letter, which I ſent to my friend on this ſubject, I endeavoured to ſhew, that a diſagreement in numbers, when the accounts of hiſtorians are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is not a ſufficient authority to juſtify a charge of corruption; and I ſuppoſed an example of two hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans giving an account of the number of ſlain in a battle; the one that 1000 men were killed, and the other that no leſs than 2000 were loſt in the ſame battle; and I obſerved, that, if the account is true of 2000 being killed, the other account cannot be called a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, becauſe a leſs number is mentioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and this I thought ſufficient to exemplify, that a ſmaller number, when given <hi>without an abſolute limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is no contradiction to a greater number. But it has been objected to this example, that it is <hi>by no means parallel to the caſe in queſtion, becauſe the numbers of ſlain in battle in large armies, as given by Hiſtorians,</hi> are, from the nature <hi>of the thing, hardly ever to be depended upon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, when an inventory of goods is given, it is reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be exact to an unit, becauſe it eaſily may be ſo.</hi> I will therefore mention another example, not liable to the ſame objection, and more proper to be inſerted in theſe remarks becauſe it is quoted by Dr. <hi>Kennicott,</hi> (ſee page 532 of his 1ſt diſſertation,) viz. <q>
                           <hi>In</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iv. 26. <hi>we read that Solomon had</hi> 40,000 <hi>ſtalls for horſes, but in</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> ix. 25. <hi>only</hi> 4,000.</q> This Dr. <hi>Kennicott</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as one of the inſtances of <hi>miſtakes</hi> which <q>
                           <hi>are moſt eaſilyaccounted for, by admitting the addition, omiſſion, or tranſpoſition of a cypher:</hi>
                        </q> and the Doctor's favourite Author, Father <hi>Houbigant,</hi> thinks to remove all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the ſame by altering the Text in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iv. 26. from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> viz. from 40,000 to 4,000.</p>
                     <p>But the ingenious Author of a ſmall MS. book, lent me by a worthy and learned friend, (to whom I have great obligation on this, as well as many other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,) makes it appear very plainly, that the opinions of <hi>Bochart</hi> and <hi>Lud. Capellus</hi> (who think the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> inſtead of 40 ſhould be tranſlated 4) would cauſe greater difficulties than what are at preſent found in the Text; for, ſays he, <q>let this Rabbinical uſe of plural ordinal numbers be what they pleaſe; yet in the Scripture Style they are never taken ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this I affirm after having examined ſome hundreds of places, where they are either joined with appellatives, perſons, or things, or greater numbers, as an hundred or thouſand: and ſo theſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſignify 40,000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception in all other Texts they are found in; and ſo the LXX. turn them here, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſame high number.</q> He then proceeds to ſhew the great probability (<q>
                           <hi>from the Riches and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of Solomon,</hi> and the more terrible execution a <hi>Quadriga</hi> would make than a <hi>Biga,</hi>
                        </q>) that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Chariots were drawn by 4 horſes; which opinion he ſupports by a variety of quotations and learned argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and afterwards obſerves, that, as <hi>Solomon</hi> had 1400 Chariots, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> x. 26. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> i. 14.) the number of horſes, allowing 4 to each chariot, would require 5600 Stalls, beſides the Stalls neceſſary for the 12,000 ſingle Troop Horſes; which numbers will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion great difficulties if we ſuppoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> had only 4000 Stalls. He alſo obſerves, that (beſides the Stalls neceſſary for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſtanding forces) ſtandings were neceſſary for horſes preſented to him by foreign Princes, as alſo for Baggage Mules and Dromedaries, which muſt be very numerous, not only for the carriage of proviſions, tents, and other warlike neceſſaries both for horſe and foot, but alſo for water, in the vaſt ſandy wild of Arabia Deſerta as far as Euphrates. Moreover, he obſerves, that as Solomon trafficked by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants with horſes brought out of Egypt, furniſhing the Kings of Syria and the Hittites; <q>
                           <hi>ſo this running trade might occaſion theſe ſtalls to be ſo numerous, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerving the purpoſes of war, but of traffick.</hi>
                        </q> Many more reaſons are given by the ſame Author, which are confirmed by a great variety of learned quotations and authorities; but, I truſt, that thoſe few I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are quite ſufficient to prove that Father <hi>Houbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> has been much too haſty in altering the Sacred Text from 40,000 to 4000, and that he has thereby loaded it with a real difficulty, when he might have avoided the imaginary one, by admitting a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and fair ſolution, which has been approved of by a great variety of learned commentators; I mean that of conſtruing the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (not Stalls, but) Stables; which intirely removes all the difficulty: for, ſuppoſing each Stable capable of containing 10 Horſes, you very eaſily account for the number of 40,000 Stalls: and this opinion is approved of by Abarbinel, Junius, and Tremellius, Bp. Patrick, Sir Walter Raleigh, Monſ. Martin, and a great variety of other Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</p>
                     <p>Some have indeed ſuppoſed, that the chariot Horſes, ſpoken of in the parallel paſſage in 2d Chronicles ix. 25. were but 4000, which King Solomon kept at or near Jeruſalem for his conſtant guard, and that the other ſpeaks of thoſe which were diſperſed throughout his whole kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But what is moſt material to my purpoſe is obſerved by the author of the little treatiſe above-mentioned; viz. <q>
                           <hi>the diverſity between theſe two relations</hi> (viz. in 1 Kings iv. 26, and 2 Chron. ix. 25.) amounts to 36,000; but, if the firſt account is proved true,</q> (which he moſt clearly has done,) <q>
                           <hi>the ſecond muſt be ſo too, as the leſs is included in the greater number.</hi>
                        </q> Now this is the very concluſion that I drew from my former example, (viz. of the two hiſtorians giving dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accounts of the number of men ſlain in a battle,) which was objected to: and this is another reaſon for my having quoted this example of Solomon's Horſes; and I have the more pleaſure in doing ſo, becauſe it is not liable to the ſame objection as the former, for the numbers therein may as <hi>reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be exact to a unit</hi> as the account of any <hi>other inventory</hi> whatever, becauſe it eaſily might have been ſo: we find likewiſe that the difficulty therein may reaſonably be accounted for without the ſuppoſition of a <hi>miſtake,</hi> or the neceſſity of having recourſe to Father Houbigant's dangerous and unwarrantable expedient of altering the text.</p>
                  </note> ita diverſum eſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1073800300:6"/>But this account of Eſdras is not <q>ita diverſum</q> as to amount to a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1073800300:7"/>of the other, and therefore the doctor's motto is not at all applicable.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1073800300:8"/>For <hi>Ezra</hi> might at one time make particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mention of ſuch Veſſels only as were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1073800300:9"/>perhaps
<note n="2" place="bottom">
                  <p>(2) A very apt and ingenious objection has been made to this argument, and communicated to the writer of theſe Remarks; who hopes that the worthy and learned Author will excuſe his inſerting it here at length, as the omiſſion of it in this place might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be deemed an injuſtice to the ſubject in queſtion. The Objection was as follows; <q>That Ezra did not mean to mention particularly the chief veſſels only, and then to include the reſt in the general round Sum 5400, is evident from hence, that he does do this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to make up the Sum 5400; for he throws together all the Veſſels, not before ſpecified, under the article <hi>other Veſſels,</hi> and into the general round Sum 1000: and this round Sum 1000, added to the particular Sums before ſpecified, ought, in common ſenſe, to make the Sum total; which here it does not do.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding the ſeeming propriety of this objection, yet, while there is any reaſonable way left of accounting for a difficulty, we ought to be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of ſuppoſing a corruption; not from any idea of the <hi>abſolute Integrity</hi> of the Hebrew Text, but becauſe many very learned and experienced perſons have led themſelves and others into errors by eſteeming ſome difficult paſſages to be corrupt, when the truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the ſame might have been very ſufficiently vindicated.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent caſe, though I have not met with any thing, which, in my opinion, ought to be adopted as the only true interpretation, yet I think that one of the ſolutions given by Bp.

Now, as not one of the articles in the <hi>Heb.</hi> account of <hi>Ezra</hi> exceeds the numbers of thoſe in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> there can be no contradiction therein, becauſe each number may be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1073800300:12"/>included in the correſponding number in <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther; if the number of each article in <hi>Ezra</hi> had been exactly the ſame with thoſe in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> the <hi>Sum To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> 5400 would have appeared more like a miſtake; but, as they amount to no more than 2499, it is plain that the writer did not mean to enumerate every ſingle veſſel; becauſe he afterwards gives a <hi>round</hi> Sum Total of <hi>even Hundreds,</hi> viz. 5400, which is more frequent in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians than exact and particular ſums: therefore a perſon muſt be very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Hiſtory, who ſuppoſes that this is a contradiction to the Sum Total in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> becauſe <hi>the odd number</hi> 69 is omitted
<note n="3" place="bottom">(3) This numerical exactneſs in the Account of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras, which is wanting in the Hebrew Account, has occaſioned a ſuppoſition that the latter, by ſome means or other, has undergone ſome alteration. But it muſt be obſerved that ſome ancient copies of the book of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras have been <hi>equally exact</hi> in making the Sum total the amount of the ſeveral ſorts of veſſels to a unit, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the particulars are very different, and that the Sum total exceeds the common reading by 391 veſſels. The old Latin Bibles, from which the preſent Vulgate was taken, have the reading juſt mentioned, which was probably tranſlated from MSS. as ancient as thoſe from which the preſent Greek Text of Eſdras was taken: and the ſame reading is found in Tindal's old Engliſh Bible, printed in 1549. Therefore this numerical exactneſs is not a ſufficient proof of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the book of Eſdras in this place; ſo that if the Heb. of Ezra was to be corrected by it to the ſame numerical exactneſs, and if <hi>ſuch other</hi> corrections as have been propoſed were to take place in the Text of the Old-Teſtament, I am apt to think that our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bible itſelf would ſoon, by too many, be eſteemed as little better than apocryphal.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1073800300:13"/>As to the difference of the names by which the Veſſels are called, (however unlike they appear in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,) yet whoever is acquainted with the original Text muſt know that they correſpond ſufficiently; except indeed the <hi>Heb.</hi> word, which is tranſlated <hi>knives;</hi> and that is capable of being conſtrued ſeveral different ways, but there is not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1073800300:14"/>the leaſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that it has been corrupted.</p>
            <p>The next thing that I have to obſerve is, that Dr. <hi>K.</hi> has been particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in fixing upon this part of the ſacred Hiſtory as a proof of <hi>the great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the proper names and numbers in the preſent Text of the Old-Teſtament.</hi> Firſt,</p>
            <p>Becauſe it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> to give new Names to their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; ſo that it was very common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Captives to be called by two names: of this the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> gives ſufficient proof; and therefore this difference is of the leſs conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two different names may mean the ſame perſon.</p>
            <p>And, Secondly, becauſe theſe three Books all agree in the ſum total of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1073800300:15"/>
               <note n="4" place="bottom">
                  <p>(4) This agreement of the three Books in the ſum total of Perſons has occaſioned a ſuppoſition, <q>that the Catalogue in all three was originally the ſame; and that all three are now imperfect in ſome of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, ſince the particulars in none of them now amount to the ſum 42,360, which is ſaid to be the ſum of each.</q> But there is no proof that the liſt, which Nehemiah found, was exactly the ſame with that from which Ezra copied; for many different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts might have been taken by the Perſons appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to number the people, even under the ſame title of <hi>the Children of the Province that went up out of Captivity,</hi> &amp;c. and though they might find it very eaſy to agree in the ſum total, <hi>even to a unit,</hi> by reckoning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, promiſcuouſly, by fifties, hundreds, or thouſands, (in which method the want of pedigrees would cauſe no difficulty,) yet in taking the numbers of the families ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately they might be very liable to differ, on account of the difficulty of aſcertaining the legitimacy of ſome particular perſons in many of the ſaid Families.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be obſerved too, that not one of the three liſts mentions the number of Prieſts, who were rejected for want of proper Regiſters, though the names of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are the very laſt in each liſt, juſt preceding the Sum total; ſo that there is no doubt but that they are included therein notwithſtanding: therefore, as the conſent of all three informs us, beyond contradiction, of the real Sum total, ſo the want of the number of theſe Prieſts <hi>in all three liſts</hi> ſeems <hi>as clearly</hi> to prove that the particular numbers in each were <hi>not intended</hi> to make up exactly the ſaid Sum total; becauſe it muſt otherwiſe ſeem very unaccountable, that <hi>all theſe three Liſts,</hi> as well as <hi>all the ancient verſions, which have been made from them,</hi> ſhould happen to be corrupted <hi>in the ſame identical place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Kennicott ſeemed to be aware of this objection, when he firſt <hi>publiſhed</hi> his Catalogue of names in his ſecond Diſſertation, page 508, &amp;c. for he has there omitted theſe three laſt names, which have no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſpecified, though he has thought fit to add them to his ſecond Edition in the printed ſheet; becauſe he muſt have been convinced, that they ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Sum total, notwithſtanding the triple evidence of theſe Liſts, that <hi>no number ought to be added to the ſame;</hi> and, conſequently, that the exact number 42,360 was never intended to be made appear from the addition of the particular Sums in any of theſe Liſts.</p>
               </note>; viz. 42,360; and yet none of their accounts amount to that ſum by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1073800300:16"/>
               <hi>upwards of</hi> 8000: ſo that were the names and numbers, which are particularized in each book, much more different than they really are, they could not with juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be accuſed of contradiction; becauſe there is ſufficient room left <hi>in any</hi> of theſe hiſtories for the mention of <hi>many different Families,</hi> which might have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the others.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe who content themſelves with the Doctor's Catalogue, without farther examination, may indeed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he has ſhewn them <hi>moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1073800300:17"/>ſome great corruptions of proper names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he has <q>
                  <hi>diſpoſed them in ſuch a manner</hi>
               </q> as to compare the name <hi>Bezai</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> with <hi>Haſhum</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> and again, <hi>Jorah</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> with <hi>Bezai</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which ſhould have been placed in the line above; alſo <hi>Haſhum</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> (which ſhould have been placed two lines higher) with <hi>Hariph</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Likewiſe he has placed <hi>Lod</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Jericho, Hadid</hi> to <hi>Lod, Ono</hi> to <hi>Hadid,</hi> and <hi>Jericho</hi> to <hi>Ono,</hi> each in a wrong line. So that he muſt either allow this to be a great miſtake, or elſe that theſe names are <hi>"diſpoſed in ſuch a manner"</hi> as to prove nothing at all of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<note n="5" place="bottom">(5) By way of excuſe for Dr. Kennicott, it has been urged, that the names are taken in the order in which they ſtand in each writer, to ſhew how the order of the original Catalogue has been diſturbed, and that he did not intend to compare thoſe names, which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly different, as if meant for the ſame perſon: but as no ſufficient evidence has ever yet been produced, that the order of the names has really been diſturbed, in any of the Liſts, from what it was when written by the Authors of each; and as I have, in a former note, ſhewn a probability, that the Catalogue in all three Liſts <hi>was not originally exactly the ſame;</hi> and as this ſeems to be proved by theſe very variations in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the names; therefore I think that the Doctor's <hi>manner of diſpoſing</hi> the names cannot with juſtice be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1073800300:18"/>At the head of the names the Doctor has placed a Title, <hi>viz. "The Twelve Chief Men,"</hi> by which people may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily be led to ſuppoſe that the chief men were confined to the limited num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Twelve; but the Scriptures make no mention of a limited number of Chief Men
<note n="6" place="bottom">(6) Dr. Kennicott nevertheleſs informs us, in page 508, (Second Diſſertation,) that the <hi>twelve Chiefs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the <hi>twelve Tribes.</hi>
               </note>, but only of names: therefore it is not an inconſiſtency in the account of <hi>Ezra</hi> to mention only Eleven names. On this account, likewiſe, the difference in the names is of leſs conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not eaſy to prove that different perſons were not intended to have been
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1073800300:19"/>expreſſed thereby: on the other hand, it may be as difficult to prove that they were; though there is ſome appearance of a proof in one inſtance; <hi>viz.</hi> the names <hi>Reelius</hi> and <hi>Roimus</hi> in <hi>Eſdras</hi> (if we conſider the <hi>Greek</hi> manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>Hebrew</hi> names) will anſwer very well to <hi>Reelaiah</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Raamiah</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> which laſt names Dr. K. has compared together as ſuppoſing them to have been originally the ſame, though the ſimilar names juſt mentioned in <hi>Eſdras</hi> give us great reaſon to believe the contrary.</p>
            <p>But, before I leave Dr. Kennicott's twelve Chief Men, I will endeavour to clear up another difficulty, and will now take his ſide of the queſtion to prove, that he has done right in comparing <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum</hi> in Ezra with <hi>Nehum</hi> in Nehemiah as the name of one man, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great difference between them in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1073800300:20"/>ſound, which may at firſt ſight ſeem to favour my ſuggeſtion about different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and I ſhall have the more pleaſure in doing this, becauſe at the ſame time I ſhall <hi>ſhew moſt clearly</hi> that neither the one nor the other is corrupted. Now every perſon, who is tolerably acquainted with the Chaldee and Syriac tongues, muſt know, that N (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is frequently changed for R (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in words derived from the Hebrew, and therefore it is much more eaſy to believe that Nehemiah, like a Babylonian, wrote <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (<hi>Nehum</hi> for <hi>Rehum</hi>) than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that either of the words has been ſince corrupted.</p>
            <p>Whatever difference there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ezra and Nehemiah in numbers, (which are of leſs conſequence, as both of them fall ſo far ſhort of the total,) yet the difference in names is very imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, though Dr. Kennicott has <q>
                  <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1073800300:21"/>them in ſuch a manner</hi>
               </q> as to make it ſeem very conſiderable.</p>
            <p>There is but <hi>one name</hi> (viz. Hariph) in all this <hi>long liſt of Families,</hi> mentioned by Nehemiah, which has any material difference from thoſe mentioned by Ezra, and there are <hi>but four names</hi> in Ezra, viz. <hi>Jorah, Magbiſh, Hagab,</hi> and <hi>Aſnah,</hi> which are not found in Nehemiah; therefore as there are no names in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah to compare with theſe laſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the ſingle name <hi>Hariph,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Dr. K. to prove <hi>any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of names in the Hebrew text through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this whole liſt of families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the Doctor may imagine, that the difference of names in the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Greek book of Eſdras is a ſufficient proof againſt the integrity of the Hebrew text of the other two; otherwiſe he muſt allow, that his Catalogue proves very
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1073800300:22"/>little in this article of names. But, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that theſe differences were real contradictions, (which they are not,) the ſuſpicion of corruption muſt of courſe fall on the book of
<note n="7" place="bottom">(7) See Dr. Kennicott's ſecond Diſſertation on the State of the Hebrew Text, pages 506 and 507, where he intirely gives up the authority of the Book of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras: ſo that its teſtimony ought to have but very little weight (eſpecially with Dr. K. himſelf) in correcting the Text.</note> Eſdras. Firſt, Becauſe the two beſt Greek copies of this ſame book (viz. the Vatican and Alexandrian copies) differ very much from each other both in the names and numbers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is not of equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the others, being apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal, and therefore not received into the canon of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And, Thirdly, Becauſe two evidences againſt one, though they were all to be of equal authority, would undoubtedly gain the cauſe in this critical trial.</p>

            <p>I ſhall now endeavour to give you ſome proofs, that Dr. Kennicott has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the proper names and numbers of the <hi>preſent Text of the Old-Teſtament,</hi> as being <hi>greatly corrupt,</hi> without giving
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1073800300:27"/>himſelf the trouble (for any thing that appears in the catalogue to the contrary) even to examine the original text; and that he has contented himſelf with ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the names and numbers mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they occurred in the Engliſh tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</p>
            <p>This is not leſs injuſtice than if a judge were to condemn a priſoner merely from the report given of him by others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permitting him to appear before him to anſwer for himſelf.</p>
            <p>My proofs of the Doctor's having mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly copied the Engliſh Verſion, I ſhall take out of the book of Eſdras: becauſe with that (I ſuppoſe) he meant to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Hebrew Text.</p>
            <p>Verſe 13. He has taken the name <hi>Sadas,</hi> and the number 3222 only from the Engliſh verſion; for in the Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1073800300:28"/>copy it is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 2322 in the Vatican copy: ſo that he trifles with the originals if he thinks in this manner to ſhew their corruptions.</p>
            <p>Verſe 14. He has placed the number 667 to Adonicam as in the Engliſh Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Eſdras, whereas the Vatican copy reads 637, and the Alexandrian 647.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1073800300:29"/>Verſe 37. <hi>Ladan,</hi> as in the Engliſh, which is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the original.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the number of ſervants, 7347, is plainly a miſtake copied from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Verſion; for the original Greek, as well as the Syriac Verſion of the ſame, is agreeable to the Hebrew 7337.</p>
            <p>Now as many of the ſeeming differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (which the reader, as Dr. Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicott ſuppoſes in page 507, 2d Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, will view with ſurprize) are not to be found in the original, but are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Doctor's copying merely from the Engliſh Verſion; as many other differences in names are cauſed only by the changing of letters, according to the common Chaldaean mode of expreſſing Hebrew words, and therefore are not liable to the charge of corruption; and as the moſt material differences between Ezra and Nehemiah are made by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's having placed the names in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1073800300:30"/>in which they ſtand in each writer, which has cauſed him to compare names manifeſtly different, as if meant for the ſame perſon; ſo I muſt conclude (all theſe things conſidered) that not only the diſpoſition of names, but the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is intirely unfair, becauſe the Doctor's motto leaves no room for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to be made for whatever may have occaſioned the ſeveral ſeeming differences, but condemns them indiſcriminately with a bold inſinuation of falſehood, viz. <hi>Non poteſt verum aſſeri quod ita diverſum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor in his printed Sheet has indeed placed this motto cloſe by the ſide of his quotation from the apocryphal Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> but it is plain that he intended thereby to cenſure the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the whole catalogue, becauſe he prefixed the ſame unjuſt motto to his <hi>firſt publication</hi> of the Catalogue in his 2d Diſſertation, p. 508.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1073800300:31"/>I call this motto unjuſt, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is there applied indiſcriminately to a quotation from two canonical Books of the Old-Teſtament, but becauſe St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s authority is quoted for it, as if he had applied the ſame words, for the ſame purpoſe, to the Book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> though it appears very plainly by St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>'s preface to the ſaid Book, that he was ſpeaking only of differences in the various copies of <hi>the Greek Verſion,</hi> when he made uſe of thoſe words.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the many faults, which I have found in the writings of this Gentleman, yet I have a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of him, than to ſuppoſe, that he will ever endeavour to evade my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Catalogue, by alledging that he did not mean by it to ſhew the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the original Text, but only of the common <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, which he has here copied word for word; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1073800300:32"/>that he meant the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation where he has mentioned <hi>the preſent Text of the Old Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, notwithſtanding the improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that there is of the Doctor's ever ſeeking ſuch an evaſion, yet he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me if I endeavour to guard againſt any ſort of ſhifting-off from the point whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Therefore I muſt obſerve, that the Text of any author cannot mean <hi>a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,</hi> eſpecially when a perſon is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of corruptions in it; for the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Text muſt mean ſome wilful or accidental alteration from the original copy of the Author.</p>
            <p>No Perſon therefore, ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corruption in a Tranſlation of any Book, may ſay that they are corruptions of the <hi>preſent Text</hi> of the ſaid book; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1073800300:33"/>at the ſame time perhaps the real and original text contains none of thoſe faults which he complains of.</p>
            <p>So that, ſhould the Doctor have really only meant to expoſe ſome defects, which he might imagine he had diſcovered in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſion, (though I cannot think that he intended any ſuch thing by this Catalogue,) yet it muſt appear to the Eyes of all thoſe who know him, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertaking, as if theſe unjuſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were levelled at the Original Text itſelf.</p>
            <p>There are many other things, I believe, which might be alledged againſt this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, but I ſhall only beg leave to trouble the reader with two more.</p>
            <p>Though there might be many <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Families called after the names of places, as <hi>Bethlehem, Ramah, Jericho,</hi> &amp;c. yet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1073800300:34"/>perhaps Dr. <hi>K.</hi> may have difficulty to prove that any <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Families were called <hi>Tel-melah, Telharſa, Cherub,</hi> and <hi>Addan,</hi> (<hi>Immer</hi> the next name being indeed an exception,) although he has placed them in his liſt of families under the running Title of <hi>"The Children of."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if he had attended to the context, even of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, he might have underſtood, that theſe were really the names of places, and not of families; for we are there informed, that the Families, afterwards mentioned, <q>which <hi>went up from</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>the ſaid places,</hi> 
               <q>ſought their regiſter among thoſe that were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned by genealogy, but they were not found.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another miſtake he has likewiſe made in comparing <hi>Cherub</hi> and <hi>Addan,</hi> the names of <hi>places</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> with <hi>Charaathalar</hi> and <hi>Aalar,</hi> the names
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1073800300:35"/>
               <hi>of men</hi> mentioned by <hi>Eſdras;</hi> though the context plainly ſhews that there were no other than what I ſay.</p>
            <p>I will not however inſiſt on theſe two laſt articles, becauſe I preſume that I have before ſufficiently proved, that this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>does</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>not ſhew moſt clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the preſent Text of the Old-Teſtament.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, leſt my cenſure of this catalogue ſhould ſeem to ſtrike obliquely at Dr. Kennicott's preſent undertaking of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Heb.
